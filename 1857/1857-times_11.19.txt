jtONEY-MARKETand CITYIN2'ELLIGBNCE. MON Wednesday Evening. The applcatlons at the Bank of 3England for discount increase rather than diminish, and the list of failures has again been seriously extended; bait the public have abundant supplies of money for investgnent, and the funds show undiminished firmness. Consola for money, which advanced after regular hours last evening to 89i to i, were first quo'ed 891 to i, whence they inproved to 89i to i. Ultimately, although the quotations were again 89i to J for money and 89i for the 7th of December, the market presented a very good appearance. There was no particular pressure for loans on Government eecurities, and the rate ranged between 8 and 10 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214 ; Reduced, 88i to J; New Three per Cents., 88i to J; India Stock, 211 to 214; India Bonds, 45s. to- 3s. discount; and Exchequer-bils, 18s. to 13s. diWcount. The demand at the Bank to-day was extraordina rily heavy, but it must be remembered that the notea thus obtained are paid into the various banks with whom the discounters keep accounts, and that at the end of the day these banks pay them into the Bank of England, so that, under certain circumstances, it is quite possible for an enormous quantity to be put forth by that establishment without its 3ustaining any ultimate diminution of its stock. It is only when notes or gold are drawn out to strengthen the reserves of provincial bankers, or when gold is taken for exportation, that the resources of the Bank of England are impaired, and the peril in these respects in now subsiding. The sun in Scotland appears to have entirely ceased, and a further total of 100,000 sovereigns was received thence this morning. From Ireland the reports are so far favourable, that it is not thought anDy addition will be required to the large sums already sent there. In this country the stoppage of the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Banking Company may lead to some increased precautions on the part of local establishments, but it is believed that In moat cases ample provision against emergencies has been made for several weeks past. With regard to the foreign drain, not only is it for the moment completely checked, but we are beginning to enjoy the benefit of such arrivals as take place. To the East the shipment on mercantile account by the packet of the 20th, instead of being 800,0001., in accordance with the ordinary scale throughout the greater part of the year, will be only 68,0001. MIeanwhile some gold arrivals from Australia and Russia lhave found their -gay to-day to the Bank, and from both quarters further amounts are immediately expeeted. From New York also, it is thought, remittances will now again be received by each steamer. The Baltic this afternoon has brought a moderate sum, and the Persia is looked for on Saturday with a comparatively considerable total. Under these circumstances an improvement may be hoped. The public mind, owing to the almost total impracticabilty of obtaining advances on bills of over three months' date from the sudden withdrawal of the "C facilities " hitherto recklessly granted by some of the discount houses, is undoubtedly in such a condLition that the slightest increase of distrust might lead to an incalculable extension of the prevailing mischief; but if the next few days should pass wlthout any fresh disaster of unexpected magnitude there will be ground to trust that a gradual recovery may be at hand. During the day the probability was discussed of a further advance in the Bank rate of discount tomorrow, but the gold arrivals diminish the prospect of such a step. An average business has been transacted in foreign stocks, but in some cases the market has shown a tendency towards further depression. An advance took place in the early part of the day in Turldsh, but it was not maintained; and the closing price was slightly lower than that of yesterday. Dauish Three per Cents, were negotiated at S2i; ditto, Five per Cents., 100; Mlexican, 181; Peruvian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 75 and 74; for the account, 74; Portuguese, 42:1; Russian Five per Cents., 104; Spanish, Deferred, 241 and J; Turkish Six: per Cents., 87;-, J, and J ; for the account, 88,, i, and 88; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 97, J, and ' ; French Three per Cents., G7; and Dutch Twoand-a-Ralf per Cents., 63i and 643. The corn-market was weak this momning at the heavy decline of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on tho Paris Bourse this evening were GTf. for money, and 6 7f. 10c. for the end of the month, ahowing a further advance of three-eighths per cent. On the Vienna Exchauge the pressure increases, and within the past ten days the premium on gold has advanced 2 per cent. About 92,0001. of Australian and 62,0001. of Russian gold were taken to the Bank to-day, making, with 100,000 sovereigns from Scotland, a total receipt of 254,0001. A further sum of 62,0001. Russian gold is expected in a few days. The Fulton, for New York from Southampton to-day, has taken out 21,3701. The suspensions to-dav have been numerous. First on the list is the old and respectable mercantile house of E. Sieveking and Son, with liabilities for more than 400,0001. They are connected with the Swedish trade, and will suffer from the stoppage of Hoare, Buxton, and Co., announced yesterday; but the immediate cause of their difficulties was the failure of Broadwood and Barclay on the 9th inst. Annexed is the circular iesued:- " 65, Fenchurch-street, Nov. 18. "With feelings of the deepest grief we announce to you thedutywhich has been forced upon us to suspend payments this day-we trust temporarily only, as we enterhain a confident hope not only of satisfying all our creditors in full with interest, but also of realizing a surplus, provided our assets be not dissipated by unforeseeen hostile proceedings. "1 Embarrassed by the unexpected failure of Mesrs Broadwood and Barclay, whose acceptances we held to a large amount, and whose fall has compromised somae of our West India connexions with whom we are deeply involved, we have also at this critical period been deprived of the customary channels of accommodation, and the efforts of friends to support us have been rendered nugatory by the impossibility of making available a large amount of bills now in our possession. We are thus compelled to take a step of the painful necessity of which we had not until quite recently the remotest suspicion. " With the aessstance of Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Co. we shall prepare a balance-sheet, which shall be laid before our creditors with all possible despatch, but we need hardly add that, from the nature uad extent of our business, some lime must elapse before its completion. " Bespealing your kind sympathy under these sad reversee, "We remain, &c., " E. SIEVBEMG AND SON. S P.S-Since tbo foregoing was penned the suspension of Messs. Hoare, Buxton, and Co. has been announced, by which we fear our position will be materially altered." In consequence of the difficulties of Sieveking and Son and Hoare, Buxton, and Co., Messs. Allen, Smith, and Co., ohiefly engaged in business with Denmarlk, have also suspended. The amount of their liabilities h.s not transpired. Messrs. Svendsen and Johnson, merchants, shipbrokers, and coal exporters, with branch establishmaents at Newcastle and Hartlepool, have likewise stopped from the samo cause. Messrs. Gorrissen, Hilffel, and Co., merchants, have been brought down by the absence of remittances from America, and have issued the following : " 1, Royal Exchange-buildings, Nov. 18. " Gentlsme,-With deep regret we bava to acquaint 3ou that we are compelled to suspend payment, and have in coneequenc* to request the indulgenoe of our creditor. H Heavy cash advaces to paties in the United Siates, who are at present unable to meet their engagements-the *ffectef recent falurta in this country, In suddenly renidelg I,r avallable remittances already received, togother with tha tncertainty which exists respecting future remittace s ale the causes which have necessitated this step on otu: part. " Our books are placed in the hands of Mmessrs Quilter, Ball, and Co., -with instructions to investigate our affiirs and to prepare a fUll statement of them for submnLison to our creditors at a meeting convened with the least possible delay, and of which due notice wiU be given. " we remain, &c., "GORRTSSEN, HUFFEL, A2ND Co." There has likewise been a failure of a corn importing firm-Messrs. Brocklesby andWessels--with liabilities estimated at about 40,0001., and assets which, at present depressed prices, would yield about 30,0001. Annexed is their circular:- " Muscovy-court, Nov. 18. "We deeply regret being obliged to announce to you t'hat, owing to the depre-sed stats of the corn trade and the prerent unsatisfactory condition of the money-market, we have been compelled to suspend payment. " A statement of our affairs, which is now being propared by Mr. G. H. Jay, of Old Jewry-chambers, will be submitted to you at an early period, and in the meantime wo have to solicit your kind indaulgence. " We are, &c., "BROCKLESBY .hND WESSELS." Messrs. Hoare, Buxton, and Co., whose failure in the Swedish trade was announced yesterday, have since addressed their creditors as follows:- " 23, Old Broad-street, Nov. 18. "The unprecedented state of the rmoney-market having thrown unexpeoted liabilities upon us, the result of which we are at present unable to estimate, we have been under the painful necessity of suspending our payments, " Our dependencies are principally with Sweden, and relying on the good faith and stability of our correspondents there which have hitherto charactorized their commercial transactions with us, we trust that we shall be enabled to discharge our liabilities in a conmparatively limited period. "1 We have placed our affairs In the hands of Messrs. J- B. Coleman and Co., the accountants, and propose to have a meeting of our creditors at the earliest day possible. In the meantime we shall adopt measares for the most speedy realization of assets for division, in order to obviate, as far as possible, the inconvenience which our suspension may have caused. " The Calcutta and Manchester firms of Roare, Mlller, and Co., are in no way affected by our suspension. "Yours very obediently, ' HOARE, BUXTON, A.Nn Co." A meeting of creditors of Messrs. R. Bainbridge and Co., whose suspension was announced on the 13th inst., was held to-day, but in the absence of accounts from America no positive information as to the financial state of the firm could be given. The immediate cause of the disaster vwas stated to be the failure of Messrs. Dennistoun, whose acceptances Messrs. Bainbridge held to the amount of 11,0021. A committee of four creditors was appointed to watch proceedings and to call a meeting as soon as further intelligence arrives from the United States. The precise amount of specie to be shipped for the East by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Nemesis on the 20th is 318,7871. Of this 1,0001. is for Alexandria, 5001. for Aden, 295,3041. for India and Ceylon, andt 21,9831. for China and the Straits. Nearly the whole is silver, the gold being about 5,0001. only. The greaterportion (250,0001.) consists of a remittance by the East India Company to the Government at Calcutta. An improvement which has occurred in the shares of the East Indian railway companies during the last two days is attributed to a report that the Imperial Government have resolved to assume an undivided control over that empire. It is also affirmed that no loan is contemplated to be raised on its behalf in England. The Western Bank of Scotland it appears is to be resuscitated if the shareholders will subscribe a specific amount and the creditors will grant certain periods of extension. As the recovery of claims is much more practicable and inexpensive in the case of a concern that has stil a vital character than under the operation of liquidators, it is satisfactory for the sake of the deluded proprietary that a prospoect of this kind exists. Whether it is to be desired for the general interests of the community is another question. Under a resumption an exposure will, of course, be more or less avoided of the profligacy that has brought the bank to its present posltion-an object which doubtless adds to the immediate zeal of all who might be implicated-but for the sake of public justice, and especially with a view to the approaching Parliamentary discussion, it would be well for the whole details to bo dragged to light. 'Moreover, the Western Bank of Scotland does not profit by experience. It was helped on a former occasion, and the result is unfavourable to any propositions it may henceforth make. It seems to be admitted that 1,000,0001. of the assets has been lost. It is " thought" that that amount may enable the business to be carried on as usual. It is also aileged that at least half of the deficiency has been through advances in aid of a gang of pretended mercantile firms whose whole system was based Uponl the manufacture of fictitious paper. The private history of these proceedings must be fall of inistruction. The directors either sanctioned them or committed the worse offence of intrusting a singlo manager with uncontrolled power, not merely to squander among his creatures the funds directly committed to the Board, but also to play with the entire responsibility of his victims to their last farthing and their last acre. Bat, although the whole of this is likely to be passed over, and it is probable that so far from any of the promoters of it being brought to punishment, several of them will still retain their position and be bonoured with future votes of confidence, a conjecture as to their general course of action may be gathered from the revelations in connexion with a similar institution less fortunate In the prospect of secrecy. The TYiverpool Borough Bank is to be wound up under the Joint-Stock Companies Act of the present year, and in this case, therefore, we may hope to be enlightened as to the interior working of such concerns. Already a meeting haa been held at which much bhas been unfolded, although the usual desire was manifested, perhaps for necessary reasons, that the outside world should know as little as possible. The directors announce that more than one-fourth of the capital Is gone, and that three-fourths are " unavailable." Land, ships, shares, and other things expressed by the term " securities of various kinds, " constitute a large part of the wreck that remains. According to a committee of shareholders, indeed, not only the capital but also a considerable portion of the deposits and other means of the bank are locked up in this way. Calls are therefore to be made and enforced upon the unhappy zhaeholders " -with all reasonable speed." The most significant fact, however, is one that bears strongly upon the desirableness or otherwise of encouraging attempts on the part of concerns of this kind, such as are now making by the Western Bank of Scotland, to resume. After the stoppage of Mr. Oliver, of Liverpool, in 1854, in which the Borough Bank and its supporters 'were very discreditably compromised by attempts at public deception, the directors wrote off 371,0001. to the debit of profit and loss, but, so far from this having operated as a warning, it Is evident it was only to have been talken as a stimulus to greater gamabling in future, in order that it might be rapidly repaired and exposure prevented. Everything was to be kept quiet. It was "5 thought that one or two prosperous years would place these accountx on a legitimate footing." 'What was meant by II prosperous" years may easily be imagined. In ordinary and legitimate banking the possibility of profit is always clearly defined, and it admits of little variation. Did the Liverpool directors hope some new Mr. Oliver might rise up tb serve their purposea whom they might use and tbrow off in time so that his defalcatlonp might fall exclusively upon the publio instead of, as ln the previous inatance, chiefly on themelvest )Thatever may have been their views a to the pros- Ierity by which so much was -to -be made in one or two years, in addition to the usual handsome d vidends, they were dianDpointed. "U Unfortunately," it is remarked, " this project has not been realized, and the crisis which has now come upon this institution has been its conseque3ee." Here, then, we have an example of the way in which lessons in such eases are turned to account. Instead of a mitigation of recklessness the cry is " double or quits." The Western Bank of Scotland boasts of excellent intentions under a new management-(a new manager is always to set everything right)-but, viewed by the light of the Liverpool disclosures, it is an uncomfortable feature that they also boast of their future prospects of rapid recovery. They have at least a million to make up. What is the number of prosperous years in which that process is to be effected ?

R]ESTORATION OF HicGHA) FzRmRs CHuRcn.- This formerly coUegiate church, justly styled " one of the finest in a district remarkable for the splendour of Its ecoledastical buildings," is undergoingmostextensiverestoraton, cnder the superintendence of Mr. W. Slater. Higham was the birthplace of Archbishop Coicheley, who is said to have been found here tending his father's sheep by William of Wykehamn, who, noticing his intelligence, patronized him, and instilled into him his architectural as well as his church principles. He has left at EHigham, In the Bedehouse and Echool, proofs of his attaohment to his native place, and the fine parish church, though in the main a century older, shows clear indications of having undergone a thorough restoration in the hands of the Archbishop, whose likeness and arms are to be found in the fine perpendicular woodwork of the chancel, which stiU exists In almost perfect integrity. There is a very ourious pavement at the east end, which has been accurately drawn and described by Lord Alwyne Compton.

SUDDEN DEATH.-An inquisition was taken on Tuesday afternoon before Mr. Valentino Cox, University coroner, and a jury of matriculated Persons, to inqtire into the sadden death of the Rev. Charles Alcook, ALA., formerly Fellow of Now CoUege, vicar of Adderbury with Barford, St. John's curacy, and Atilton Hamlet, hut who has for some time past been residing at Midhurst, Sussex, who was discovered dead in a watereloset in the college. The deceased was on a short visit to New Colege, and had attended the "gaady" on Thursday last. On Friday morning he appeared as well as usual. Ho had told his servant he should leave Oxford by the 10 30 traln, and return to Iew College on Tuesday. Notbing rnore was eeon or heard of him. It wB as noticed Since then that the door of one of the 'waterliosets in the college had remained fastened, hut as this hiad occured before it was not opened till yesterday morn- .ng, when the booy of Yr. Ailcock was found Inide. The jurv retureasiaverdict "ThaRt the deceased dled saddenly and from naMoral causes."
BEC-A S ZlN OF THE WESTMINSTER BE r. 'Wo find that the statement which appeared in then columns yesterday respecting the recasting of this bell is incorrect in several respects. In matters of this and, of course, we have to depend on information which sometimer lurns out to be merely premature gossip, and sometimeg more than premature. We have nowr authentio informa. lion that until the evening before that paragraph appeared. nothing had been settled about the recasting of the bell, Profeesor FAraday never was a commissoner respecting It, having etated that he had paid no attention to the arbject of bellfoanding. Profesor Wheatstone, though nominaL i inths first instauce with Mr. Denison audthe Rev. W. TAy. 'or, never acted ;thebellwillnotborecastbyMessrs. Warmer, srd it will not be of the same dimensions as before. Some new light has been thrown upon the cause of the fracture within the last few days, which is not without bearing o0 the other proceedings. Mr. Denison told the First Com. missioner of Works immediately after the accident that ha had no doubt, from a comparison of the weight of the beli: with the others subsequently cast from his patterns, that it would be found to be much thicker in the middle or waist than It ought to have been according to his drawings, an! thst this undue thickne-s was the reason why such a heavy' clapper had been required to bring out the fall souad; and tha- the bell had been broken by ringing it with sach a clapper, which the Eound.bow, or striking part of the bell, was not calculated to bear. It has been stated before the.S the bel was generally thicker than 3r. Denison intended, and two tons heavier, and half a note higher ; bat it was supposed at firkt, from measuring the sound bow andthe top, that the thickness had only been iacreased proportionately throughout5 and only to an extent which would have done no harm. In order to test the accuracy of this new hypothesis In the most certain way some holes have now been bored through the waist of the bell, and it is found to be no lesa than 5g inches thick where Mr. Denison's design prescribed. only 41. This at once accounts for the fracture-at least in the opinion of both the referees, as stated to Sir B. Hall-by accounting for the unusuaUly large clapper which was required, more especially as the founth quarter bell, which is nearly as large as the great bells of Lincoln and St. Paul's and is cast according to the prescribed pattern, and comes out the intended weight and note, sounds freelyr undera comparatively small hammer. So much for the death of Big Ban. The reason why hig former creators are not to have the reputation of bringlrg him to life again is simply that they asked a price for doing so which was thought unreasonable, even withoat regard to the circnamstance above stated. It was therefore determined to receive other tenders, and the result is that Mr. Mears's tender is accepted, who offers to reast the bell in three months, on the same conditions as to inspection and certificates and analysis as on the former occasion, and at a price which will probably not much exoeed 60W., as the weight of the bell will now be reduced to what waa originally intended, and the diameter to 9 feet, in order to reproduce the same note with the thickness reduced to the proper amount. It may be added that tho cost of the bells, even with this extra expense, will not exceed the sum already voted by Parliament for them, as the work had thus far been done considerably within the estimate. It is most fortunate that the bell was rang frequently before it went up, as this accident would have been a very much more serious affair, both in cost and digappointment, if it had happened after the bell was up and the clock fixed under it and over the shaft up which the bell must go. There was a slight inaccuracy in out longer notice yesterday of the clock tower and clock, The description of the clock thera referred to is not given in the second edition of the Encyclopcsdia Britannica itself, hut in two of Mr. Denison's articles therein lately republished under the title of Cloc};s and Locks, from which our information was in a great measure derived. It is expected, moreover, that the new bell, requiring a smaller hammer, will save the necessity for winding the clock by water, as there described. If so, the fracture of the old ono will have been a very profitable accident.
EXBTER-HALL SERFICES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The committee for the "special services for the working classes" are intending to resume them when a suitable locality is found. This seems to be a strange announcement to be made by bishops and clergymen of the church of England. Row can they be at a loss for a locality as long as thero are the naves of St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey unoccupied Sanday after Sauday, and why should it be thought that the " working classese' would not attend there as wel as in Exeter-hall? They do attend as it is, attracted chiefly I suppose by the music, and why should they not fill the naves if popular preachers were ap. polnted to preach to them? Is it the mere fact of Exeter. hall being an unconsecrated building that induces them to go to it? If so, are we not encouraging a taste ior the meeting-house rather than for the conseorated church by inviting them into it, making them think, in fact, that the one is as good as the other ? Of cocrse there are thousands who think that it is so; but should we expect to see bishoDs of our church heading sucE opinions and encouraging them? The fact is, we do not like to see Mr. Spurgeon attracting thousands in his Mu-sichall while our cburches are comparatively empty, and so we try to follow the Spurgeon movement by collecting our thousards into D music-hall, and tacitly confess that it is as good as any consecrated church for all the purposes of worship to Almighty God. I, for one, should be puzzled what answer to give to any poor person who were to ask me if this opeaing of Exeter-hall did not prove that our bishops and clergy who have sanctioned it thought Exeter-hall as fit a place for worship as a consecrated churcb. If the real reason be that we want a large space for the reception of crowds of worshippers, let them be invited into our glorions catbedrals, bnUt for God's worship and service, and where reverent devotion is possible, and let us leave Exeterball to be occupied,as it should be, bylecturers aud mnusicians and platform exhibitions. I beg to remain, Sir, your obedient servant. T. 2;ov. 17.
TuF SCIIOOL-CHUBRCH OF ST. PETER'S, STEP?EY.- A " echocl-chureb," so called, was opened in the populou3 di3trict Of St. Peter's, Stopney, at the commencement of the year, for the benefit of the working'classes, who there enjoy the privilege of attending short ecclesiastical services in a commodious andc well-warmed room, and the advantage of secular instruction in the form of popular lectures. The Rev. T. J. ltowsoll, the incumbent of the district, is at pre. sent giving a short course of lectures in St. Peter's SchoolChurch oi "The lHistoryof British India," now, naturally, one of the most "tking" topics of tho day. The second of these lectures was delivered on Tuesday evening before an overflowing audience, including the Rev. Messrs. Barry, Green, and Stevenson, the curates of St. Peter's, and a select circle of gentlemen and ladies. The bulk of the audience, however, consisted of workingmen and their families, who listoned to the lecturo of their respected minister with eager attention, only interrupted occasionally by a burst of applause. Mr. Rowsell dolivers his lectures extempore, and without the assistance of notes. His style is popular, his manner earnest and impressive, and his subject-matter, If to educate3 persons necessarily rather trite, is set forth in the most interesting light, and iUustrated by varions amusing anecdotes, sure to " tell" upon a miscellaneous assemblage. Tha admission to the lecture is froo, the benevolent object of M1r. Rowasei being to improve and instruct his poorer parishioners, to encourage and develope a taste for sound literature, and above aU (as in theso Indnla lectures) to stimulate the lower classos toraise themselves from tho ranks by such bonourable exertions as raised Clive and other Indiaa heroes from a lowly and obscure position to the loftiest niche in the temple of fame. To judge from the eagerness with which his parishioners attend these lectures, and the attention with which they are listoned to, Mr. Rowsell's laudable efforts are lkely to be rewarded vith signal saccess. The "s chool-church" of J St. Peter's is a novel but most successful experiment. VOTE ON THrE STATE DEBT.-Below we have the returns of the vote on the Stato debt In 35 counties. There are eight counties yet to be heard from. It Is an exceodingly gratifying exhibit. It is a declaration from the people of tho State of California, that though the officers elected by them had unlawsully contracted a heavy debt, yet as it had been used, or at least a great portion of it, for the support of the Government instituted by themselves, and as by their own inaction heretofore they, in fact, tacitly acquiesced in its accumulation, the stain of repudlation shall never attawh to the State of their adoption. It is a remarkable fact, that from the day on which the decision was delivered by the Supreme Court, declaring the State debt illegal, every newspaper In the State, with a very few exceptions, opposed reTudiation. It was one of the raost remarkable instances of unanimity of opinion In a community that has ever come under our observation. The result of the vote on the question clearly establishes that they trnlv reflected public sentiment. It is true that one or two newspapers did openly advocate repudiation, but they have long since died out; and that a few other journals of a particular political stripe did lean a little that way, but public sentiment was so strong and decided upon the question that they very prudently refrained from o 'ending it, and contented thernselves with occasion4l inuendo, bat nothing more. In relation to the Constitutional Conventi a little need be said. It was a wild and ill-advised measure. It has been defeated, The totAl vote on the question so far is 25,337, of which 18.490 wero cast for tho convention, and 6,937 against it. Under the present constitation a majority of all the votes cast at any eleotion Is necssarY to authorize the calling of a Constitutional Convention. The total vote of the State will be about 90,000, and to cary the measure, therefore, over 45,000 votes sbould bo' cast for it. It is 36 wise provision, and haa this time saved us from confusion, anarchy, and, possibly, civil war, for there were legal poizn involved in the manner of the passge of the Bill submittLng the question to the people, and the result of the forma#dos of a newv constitution mighitbe twoShtae Gove rnments, acah cla}ming to he legitimate, and the inaugutration of a state of affairs stmilar to that w hich prevalled in RhodeIslandF somes years ago.-From the &ns Fraszci.sco Hemld, Oct. 5.
r.OAVDOL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1857. The honours of our Indian heroes are before us -a G.C.B. to Sir Jom LAwR.wCE, K.C.B.'s to lV1,OCEK and WIMON. If these are instalments we have nothing more to say. We are neither fidgety nor impatient,we can wait for justice,we can wait a proper, a reasonable time. The Indian affair is not yet over. Bnt it should be understood that we are waiting, that the British public watches with a generous and keen jealousy the rewards of its faithful Indian servants, that it claims justice for them, and will be content with nothing less. Meantime we can only remark -that the man who haa-so far as one man can be mingled out foe such praise-saved Indis, aa got just the reward of the General who did not take the Red:n; that AVELOoCx and WUoN have got for the relief of Lucknow and the capture of Delhi just what Lord LvonA? and Lord CADIGANr and Sir RICHARD AIRE got for doing-we all know what-in the Crimea; and that VAN CORTLANDT and GHAMB5ILAIW are C.B.'s, -an honour distnbuted in the late war by the dozen. The country had formed its estimate of the s'vioes of there men, and is not likely to recede from it. Tho country is proud of these men. Those eopecially who constitute the bais and souroe of political power, who dictate the policy and govemn the gaovernment of England-the middle Alasses-ared proud of these men. They see in the"e m9a not only useful instrumenta, convenient tools, agents for particular services which are wanted, labourers who must be paid their wages, but men who are an honour, a boast, and a pride to the nation. They see a character in them which demands honour as its natural reward, and which can bear the weight of honour, carry off any quantity of it, and wear the crown nobly. It may suit poets and romancers to represent the aristocracy of a country as the natural privileged recipient of honour, to describe a nation as wholly depending upon its aristocracy for all the great and brilliant feats which are required for maintaining its supremacy or rank in the family of nations. This is the language of old romance. The " nobles" do everything there; they are the only true warriors and statesmen,they are the only men who take castles and cities, and storm forts and win battles; they are the only men who have heads, or wills, or aspirations, or energies, or anything of which the human race is proud; they are the patterns of the genus man, thne show specimens of the race, the samples of what our nature was designed to reach; they fulfil the ordained type of humanity, exhibit all its great traits, and do aU the great acts-everything that is difficult, grand, and lofty. No presumptuous plebeian is allowed this privilege,-high action is not meant for such as he ; he must stand by as spectator, and see the " nobles" act, and execute everywhere the task of the champion or the saviour of the State. They alone even are allowed to sacrifice themselves, and are endowed with the spirit of martyrs. Such were the HoiATiI and CUP.,ATI, and such was CuRTius of the Old World-we may almost say of the modern world before the present age in which we live. This is ancient thought, but we may say with perfect certainty now that this is obsolete thought. It was very natural for poets to talk thus,-it was convenient; perhaps it was once true; perhaps noble blood did once fulfil this work. At any rate, we do not grudge romance its machinery for creating interest, and its dramatis personw of Knights, Princes, and Barons. We are amused with it all, and take it to express the sentiment of the dlay; and still less would we cancel one page of the world's past history. But, whether or not this may have been true once, it is certain that it is not true now. If this was ever history, it is now fiction. As a matter of fact the middle classes now produce that type of mind which may be called the governing one-that character which rules manklnd, which accomplishes great objects, which marshals means to ends, gives life to a nation, and produces the great events and the noble achievements of the day. There is not one single feature, intellectual or moral, which was once thought to attach to the operations of the nobility alone, which does not every whit as fully and truly attach to the careers of our Indian Generals, born and bred in the middle ranks, and imbued with the whole tone, temper, and ethics of middle life. There is not one single feature of energy, or self-sacrifice, or daring-not one single solid, not one single briUiant trait, which belongs in history or romance to the deeds and careers of aristocracies in public, civil, or military life, at home or abroad, in the Senate or in the field, which does not belong to the careers of NEILL, NicHiOLSoN, and HAvELocx. Thesemiddleclass men do exactly now, step for step, what the representatives of aristocracy were once alone thought capable of doing. There is no duty and no service, no force of brain or of will, no mettle, no fire, no flight, which was once attributed to nobility alone which these men do not display. Theee men do all that any nobles in the world ever did. Open any history and see if any privileged order has dono more for a country than they. Here, then, we say, is the true aristocracy of England ; so far as our noble families come up to this type they belong to this aristocracy; the path is open to them; but to speak of them at this time of day as in exclusive possession of this type is the mere froth of romance. Third-rate novelists, who succeed to the obsolete theories as footmen do to the antiquated dres,-the powder, wigs, velvet breeches, and silk stockings of former days, or who wish to insinuate themselves into the circles of fashion by flattery, may snarl at the middle classes of England, may depreciate middle life to exalt upper, may lodge all the magnanimity of the nation in the one and all its emptiness, feebleness, and vulgarity in the other ; but this is the mere dream and bubble of a selfish brain in the face of facts. No theory of the exclusive greatness of NEvmr.s and GRxmviILs and Dr YERES and DE BuRGvis can stand against facts. It must vanish like any other obsolete dream of astrology or alchymy, like old geography, or old mechanics, or old astronomy, or old medicine. The repository of the governing, type of character is the British nation, and no one class singly in it. Our Indian Generals, then, we say, are the proper objects of the highest honours. High honours do not suit our aristocracy alone, though some may think so; they suit these men of the middle classes also; they suit them admirably, Sulit them perfectly. There iB no disproportion, and there will be no incongruity; these men have earned honour well, and they can wear it well. Nor let us forget one particular honour appropriate to the dead. General Nxmi has left a family behind him. A national provision for them, and that a generous one, is an honour which such a General can justly claim from the tomb. Such a provision will be an honour to the dead and to the living,-to him who earned it, and to those who receive it. The orphans of our soldiers are the children of the nation, and their national adoption, while it is their necemsary support, is also by its associations their pride ancd glory-the noblest of all family escocheons and insignia.
It is not very likely that any amount of discission or exposition wiiU ever initiate the general body of the British public into the mysteries by which the currency of a country is regulated, but there ought to be little difficulty in bringing the principles now at stake within the comprehension of any reader who may give his attention to the subject, and little doubt, we think, concerning the course which impending inquiries ought to take. The circulation of this kingdom, whatever form it may assiume, is based upon a gold standard. Bank-notes are assumed to be convertible into gold at the wil of tho holders, and, consequently, to represent gold, not by mere assumptions to that effect, but in actual reality. The notes of a particular bank-the Bank of England-are made a legal tender, and therefore gold or Bank of England notes constitute the medium of satisfaction between debtors and creditor It is obvious that the amount of gold in a country cannot be increased by any edict or created by any legislation; but it is also plain that no such limit is put to the creation of Bank of England notes, which, as things now stand, are equally valuaDle. When the creditors of a commeTyier eStablishment are expected to make a run upon it the establishment must provide itself with notes of the Bank of England or with gold in order to meet the demaud, and if it cannot do this to a sufficient extent it must atop payment. In Scotland Bank of England notes do not conrtitute a legal tender, and gold alone will ansswer the requisitions of a crisis. Now, the great question involved in the pre.. sent controversy is this --What limits should be put to the issue of notes by the Bank of England? As long as these notes constitute a legal tender it is clear that we possess the power of manufacturing money, or at least of inereasing the currency of the country, to any extent; and under what restrictions, then, If sny, ought this power to be exercizea ? In so far as the notes represent gold actually held by the issuers the quejstion of limitation does not enter into the inquiry, for the increase of circulation thux effected is evidently only tantamount to the lunase producible by an Influx of gold itself. A million of new sovereigns makes dmply an addition of so manyto the exitng stock, and if these, instead of being put into circulation, are locked up in the Bank cellars, and notes issued to the value thereof, it is clear that the expansion is just as much the result of gold as if the gold itelf had'been made current. Rigorously speaking, the theory of a gold currency would require that every note shoudd be a representative of its value in gold actually possessed by the issuer, but as the practical point, after all, is aimply that of its convertibility, a certain latitude of action becomes admissible. So long as it is morally certain that any man holding a Bank of England note can obtain Its full value in gold for it upon demand the principle of convertibility Is maintained, and the transactions of the country are, in reality, regulated and protected by a gold standard, whatever may be the amount of paper currency introduced for the sake of convenience. What, then, in the amount of notes which the Buank of England should be permitted to isue over and above the amount representing an equivalent in bullion actually possessed? This amount has been fixed, and now stands, at 14,000,000Z. It has been considered that the Bank might safely issue its notes to this amount without any danger to their convertibility or value. Its credit would never be likely to be so far impaired, or its stock of gold so far diminished, that it could not, within these limits, find cash for its notes when presented. This point of the case, indeed, suggests no argument. It is not affirmed that the limit ls too liberal, or that the excess of notes thus permitted over gold ! is too great. The cry against the Bank Charter I Act-or the Act embodying these provisions-has I always assumed an opposite character, and has been levelled, not at the magnitude of the paper issues, but at their alleged insufficiency. It is the restriction to 14,000,0001. which is complained of, ancd which is said to keep the country so short, and to make money, from the scarcity thus prevailing, so dear, that at the first moment of pressure the system breaks down, the Bank Charter Act has to be suspended, and the artificial limit imposed upon its paper issues has to be removed. Such, indeed, was the resualt in 1847, and the same event occurred last week. The week after next Parliament will meet to consider the whole question, and the circumstances by which it has thus been opened. The first question is purely one of principle. Very possibly the limit of 14,000,000k.. which must needs have been somewhat arbitrarily fixed, may admit of some expansion, but that is a minor consideration altogether. Whether the amount be settled at 14, 15, or 16 Millions signifies little so long as the calculation on which it is based is reasonable in itsef, and the principle of convertibility maintained. It is nothing less than this very principle which is impugned by the thorougbgoing opponents of the Bank Charter Act. They ]now that if a bank lies under the constant obligaton to find gold for its notes, these notes must be limited in amount, though the limitation may be more or less severe; and they contend, therefore, for inconvertibility, or an indefinite increase in the note circllation, irrespective of any gold equivalent. But would such a system either obviate commercial panics, or increase the real wealth of a country, or even facilitate trade? There in not the smallest ground for assuming that it would insure any cne of [these results. For the first we have an example before our eyes so absolutely decisive of the whole question that not a word need be added to it. If unlimited paper isues could prevent panics there would be no panics In America, for there every State is flooded with paper money, and yet this chronic inundation of notes does not preserve them, as we see, from far worse and more frequent convulsions than our own. For the second, national wealth cannot be created by mere imitations of the reality. Unless the paper circulation represents something which, like gold, polssesse essential and universal value, it will never be really equivalent to money. This point also needs no argument. The French Government of 1790 set it at rest for ever. But would the transactions of commerce be facilitated by a greater abundance of notes in circulation ? This question answered in the last. Unless commerce in conducted with a sound currency it cannot be safely conducted at aLl. If more notes were in the market they would doubtless be more readily obtainable; a glut would make them cheaper, as it does all other things, and traders might get furnished with accommodation on easier terms; but this would not be cheap money, it would merely be cheap paper, and upon the first rush to exchange sham money for real money the craah would be ten times worse than before. Either the notes, being nominally convertible, but not really covered by gold, would be presented in such numbers that the Bank, unable to cash them, would be bankrupt; or, being legally inconvertible, would depreciate in value like the French assignats. The risk of panics, and the evils of panics themselves, would simply be increased together. But there is another question of very great importance :-What have been the circumstances attending these panics, and especially that now subsiding? We heard, day after day, of the stoppage of large banking establishments in Scotland, for example, but we have not heard enough of the system or practices under which these catastrophes became producible, and which seem likely to be re. sumedwith the sameliabflitlesas before. Noarrange. ments or Bystem of any kind consistent with active commerce or the profitable employment of money can be proof against the effects of a panic when once created. If a bank, for example, is to give one class of its customers interest upon their deposits and provide another class with pecuniary accommo_ dation by means of these deposits, thus obliging two parties at once, it can clearly never be able to return the whole of these deposits at a given moment. This is the Strongest case of the necessity of credit, but there are countles others of different kinds. Credit, in fact, must enter into the dealings of a country like ours as well as money itself, and a commercial panic simply meaes the depreciation of this credit for the time. Gold and note, can never be kept in sufficient quantities to satisfy every obligation outtanding in every part of the kingdom, for the gold is not to be had, and the multiplication of notes otherwise than on a gold basix would simply destroy their value proportionaly and prevent them from going so far, Five-pound notes might be increased to any imaginable number, but the only end would be that it would take a hatfuU of them to buy a sovereign. The question at this -oint is whether any discoverable features in the prevailing ateom of trade will account at all for the occurrence of panics, which produce so much misery and alarm. There ia no prisd facie case established against any system of currency by the fact of a panic, for panics ocsur under all. Advocates on the other side would deny also that any oase was thus made out against the system of trade, and this we might allow, but the source of mischief is at least as likely to lie on this side as the other, and we hope to see a corresponding scrutiny applied. ~~~~~~~~~I
That this Indian rebellion should have been crushed anyhow would be a triumph, but it is a double triumph-a tenfold triumph-that it should have been crushed before a single reinforcement from England had arrived. Crushed, we say, for, though we may yet have to stamp out some struggling remains of life, the reptile is undoubtedly crushed. We need hardly point, indeed, to this important addition to our triuraph, because, as a matter of course, it has occurred to everybody; it is the very first observation, indeed, that the simplest person must make. The whole continent in perfectly alive to this great distinction, and the fact that the victories of Delhi and Lucknow have been achieved without, instead of by means of, reinforcements, will make a most powerful impression on every circle of sagacious politicians in Europe. We now know that the ordinary Indian army can keep India, can maintain English rule throughout any emergency, only requiring what every army must require-. the replenishment of its numbers as death diminishes them. The Indian service breeds the head, the will, .the military and administrative power, which are wanted for crushing a rebellion; its own natural strength is adequate to the occasion, it elicits the full quanturn of courage and talent from its shiefs and subordinates, and it brings up able officers and commanders to the surface as soon as they are wanted. This is a great discovery. It makes all the difference between a continuous and an interrupted English Empire-between India recovered and India always kept. It would, indeed, be a terrible price to pay for our Eastern Empire, had we to maintain it at the cost of periodical annihilations of the English name there, as we get honey at the cost of the suffocation of the bees, or as the inhabitants of a volcanic district reap their luxuriant harvests off the rich soil with the conscious peril of destruction from the neighbouring crater; and short of actual periodical annihilations, total, general suspensions of English rule, with the destruction attending them, would be national disasters to which we could hardly reconcile ourselves. But the proved and tested adequacy of our ordinary Indian army to such emergencies as these saves us this enormous sacrifice. The rebellion is put down on the spot, and the English Empire never loses its continuity, but holds its head up throughout. There is nothing feeble, then, or artificial in our tenure of India. Our hold over it is not a slip. pery, a sickly, and failing one, which has constantly to be propped up by extraordinary succour and sudden convulsive efforts at home ; no, it is a strong, a natural, a healthy tenure-a tenure maintained and enforced by our strength upon the spot. But we want to call attention to this point now in connexion with a particular theory of the position of the Europeans in India said to be favoured by the Calcutta Government. " That Govern" ment," says our correspondent, " has for some " years been composed of men with somewhat "unusual views. They consider that Europeans "should be placed exactly on a par with the "natives, should be tried by native judges, and be "reduced, in fact, to a powerless and, from their "small numbers, insignificant section of the "Indian population." This, then, is what is stated to be the official theory in India-the favourite view at head-quarters. These men would have India governed exactly as an English county is,-they would merge all the differences between Europeanw and native in the one common character of English subject, and acknowledge no more distinction between them than they would between two classes of society in this country. We presume that they would at once avow this principle, and urge its justice, equity, and benevolence. Now, we have no doubt that these men mean well. Their hobby, if it is one, is at any rate philanthropic-it is a respectable hobby, because it is only, at the worst, a doctrinaire and pseudophilosophic reflection of that great rule of British justice of which we all so properly boast. Bat, with all deference to their good intentions, we must ask these gentlemen whether this is not English justice spun out too fine, and developed too much as a theory without reference to facts ? Consider what you requireof the European bodyin India. This mere handful of men has to maintain on an emergency the English rule against the most fearful odds. You expect them to do this, and you are disappointed if they do not. But how can this possibly be done except by means of that self-confidence and conscious power which superiority of race imparts? What is it which gave energy to RAvELocK, NEmr, NIonoLsoN, and Wiso?-which inspired them with that contempt of numbers without which they could not have stirred a step ? It was the consciousness that the excess of numbers on the rebels' side was more than counterbalanced by the superiority of race on theirs. The English in India must upon an emergency do the most astounding feats; they must fight their way through half-a-dozen armies a-day, each of them three or four times as strong as their own; must take impregnable forts against all odds; must beat a fresh enemy six times their number, when they are almost dead themselves with the fatigue, thirst, and heat of a long march ; they must surpass the deeds of gods and heroes; and they must adopt as their motto for action what was once adopted as a rule of faith,-Credo quia imPossibile. All this must be done, otherwise at such a convulsion as the present our empire stops, expires then and there, and India, though it may be reconquered, ceases to be ours altogether for the time being. But if you throw upon the European body in India all the responsibilities, you must allow it some of the privileges of race. This handful of men, as we say, cannot stir a step without the impulse of this consciousness. Take away the inspiration of race, and they are spiritlems at once, utterly prostrated by their task, every faculty is benumbed, and nature gives way at the prospect of such odds. But if they are to feel the inspiration of a natural superiority to the Eindoo, it is nonsenze to expect that they can submit to a reduction to a perfect level, civil and social, with him. How is it fair to scatter a few Europeans over tne vast Eastern continent, and tell a few thousand men that they must cow two hundred millions,-rule them by the force of a higher character and intellect, and keep a whole race in subjection by natural superiority, and by the ef-confidence which their own consciousness of this superiority engenders, and at the same time put them on a civil level in every respect with their inferiors? If you use the natural inferioity of the Hindoo as your argument to stir the European to dominion, have you any right to appea to his natural equality afterwards to bring the European to a level?
An article appeared a few days since in these columns calling attention to a most improper agreement between the British Government and that of Austria respecting a line of telegraph to be constructed from Ragusa through Corfu to Alexandria. it had been stipulated, we said, that if Austria would make this line all the communications of the British Government and of the East India Company should be forwarded exclusively by it in perpetuity. A contradiction appeared in an evening paper which did not touch the matter, and was, in fact, evasive. It is most certain, we are sorry to say, that a Convention has been made by which " Hzn BRiTAsNo My3ArT!s "Government gives the assurance that their tele"graphic correspondence and that of the East "India Company shall be exclusively carried on by the telegraph line of Alexandria and "Corfu, and that as long as the line ix open they "will never themsdves open a line in competition in "Ot7wt direction." The contradiction of the Globe only extended to the transamission of the messages from Corfu to England. It appears that thewe may be sent by way of Caglari and Msrseilles, but between Alexandria and Corfu the Austrisn line wiU have a complete monopoly. We can hardly imagine how a Government in a free country could have been bold enough to pledge itself to a foreign State by such a monstrous agreement. It would even be a bold exercise of Parliamentary authority thus to presume to bind the nation for an infinite term. Let us consider for a moment what it amounts to. In no case, whatever may be the nature of the intelligence or the importance of the crisis, will the British and Indian Governments communicate except by an Austrianline, controlled entirely by Austrian officials. In no case will the Government give any encouragement to aBritish line in the same direction,whatever may be the wants of the community or the interests of the State. No line from Malta to Alexandria, or from Algeria along the African coast, wil receive the support of the British Government, and If such lines be constructed they will never be permitted to forward a Government message. The secrecy with which this Convention has been made during the recess of Parliament, and without the slightest allusion in any speech or newspaper, adds to the surprise and suspicion with which it must be received. And when it is remembered that several companies were ready to establish the requisite communication, and that the Government were urged by no necessity to close with the offer of Austria, we are the more astonished. Within the last few weeks the proposal of Turkey to make a line from Constantinople to the Persian Gulf was rejected, although 03ER P&SEU has been sent as Governor to Bagdad expremsly to bring the wild tribes into order. There is also in existence an English company which obtained a firman three years since for a sea line from Constantinople to Alexandria, and the claims of this company have also been rejected. Ia fact, while the Government has had offers from every side, and might have established two or three lines of communication, it has rejected everything in order to advance this project. The favoured line Is a concession made by the Viennese Government to Mr. BRrr. Mr. BRErT is also to construct tha line from Corfu to Malta and Cagliari, which may perhaps explain the consent of the Treasury to send telegrams by this route also. The Treasury recommended the plan of using this line exclusively if Mr. BETTr should obtain the concession, and the Austrian Government would not make the concession withoat a Convention between the two Governments to the effect that Enigland would use the line exclusively and in perpetuity, would herself make a line from Suez to India, and would bind herself to construct no competing line. The only demand which was objected to was that the messages should be sent from Corfu exclusively through Ragusa and Vienna. This was refused, and Mr. BsETr's other telegraph by Cagliari will have a share. We believe that more than one person of high position and extensive knowledge of the subject has protested against what has been done, and we trust that at the meeting of Parliament the whole matter will be sifted with the closeness -which its importance demands.
COURT CIBCUrA B. WINDSOR, Nov. 18. His Royal Righness Prince Frederick William of Prusda, attended by Captain Schwelnitz, Dr. Wegner, and the Hon. AL. Sackville West, arrived on a visit last evening at a quaDrter-past 10 o'clock. The Queen and Prince Consort, accompanied by the Prince6S ROyal and Prince Frederick William of Prussia, waked in the Home Park thiz morning. Tho Prince of Wales rode out on horseback. Governor Wodehouse had an interview with Mr. Secretary Labouchere yesterday at the Colonial-office.

We understand that Dr. Rigaud, head master of the Grammar School, Ipawsch, has been appointed to the vacant Bishopric of Antigua.-Globe. THE STATISrCAL SocnTy.-A meeting of this society, at which Mr. Heywood presided, was held on Tuesday evening at their rooms in St. James's-squar Mr. S. Brown read a roport on the Vienna Statisticil Congress of the present year, in which he stated the order of the subjects taken into consideration, which comprlsed every division of statistical science and he reported the effects roduccd by those continental congresses in extending the owledge and the desire for knowledge of statistics. The congress at Vienna was the third that had been held on the continent, and it was attended by deputations from several States that had not previously appeared at those meetings, Including Spain, Russia, and Turkey. The Spanish Government, in particular, had become so impressoe with the value of statistics that a oensus of the kIngdom had been ordered on the same plan as the census of this country, from which it appeared that instead of a population of ten or eleven millions, as before supposed, Spain contains 17,000,000 of InhabitantLs He described how cordially the members attending the congress had boen received by the Government and by the Emperor, to whom deputations from England had been presented. He alo axn. nounced that Dr. Farr, who accompanied him as a deputation from the Statistical Society, had been authorized by Lord Stanley of Alderley, on the part of the Government, to Invite the congress to hold Its next meeting in London in 1859. Dr. Farr, who was present at the meeting, further explained that the invitation he was authorized to offer had beenreadily accpted, and that the members of the Vienna congress seemed to look upon their meeting in London as a matter of course. He honed when they came the members would be as cordially recoived as they of the London soclety had been in the Austrian capital. Mr. Hendricks ques. tionod whether anm benefit arose to statistical scionce from these gatherings. He had net seon any stato. nment of valuable facts resulting from their meetins, and the imperfect manner in which the people of different nations could communicate verbally rendered such a congresso very unsatisfactory. Dr. Grey, Mr. Newmarsh, Dr. hyde Smith, and other gentlemen tookput Inthe discus sion, which principally turned upon the manner of receiv. ing the congress in the metropolis. Dr. Grey hoped that, as the Government had given the invitation, they would be prepared to vote 10,0004 for the expenses, and would take care to entertain the foreign visitors so as to send them away well satisied. Mr. Haywood said he had no doubt the Government would appoint a proyerly-constituted commission to receive the members of the congress whom they had invited. It was also observed that It was gratifying to the society that the first foreign scientific body that had ever been invited by the Government to vhit this oountry had been inviwd through their instrumentality.

The Washington correspondent of the Now YorS Courier and Rnqtirer supplies some information respecting the negotiations with Mexico. He saysa Sn "The specia embasy of Senator Benjamin to Mexico has been made the subject of ve iryIteresting coespon. denco upon our ra t Lra pblic.

Mr. Forsyth has sent to the Preasdent a very copious apology, in which he defends himself from the chirgs of the commishsioners by aserting that their decigns were InoDnxistent with the interests of his Government, and so far from denying that he opposed the grant finally obtained by them, he still avows himself hostile to it, and, declAr it a violation of the 8th artide of the Gadsdenx Treaty. Nor does he lack defende Gnerallge doe, the late Mfinister, and Mr. Ozippe his secretary, hAve come for. ward in the mot chivalrous style to protect him 'ant nult. The letters of General Gaven ana Mr. Onsip contain sarprisig revelations. Mr. CripPp asserts that inztruoueons have been sent to Mr. Forsyth to effr to Mexico more than $50,000,00d for a tract of ountry greater in extent than the whole area of the proest slave paers, and he complains with feeng of the meagrenen s of the smrooet be paid for it, as eithe insuiclent to induce Meo tho ltwith so large a t ortion of her remaining territory. Mr. Crippe fears that the effar Is made to delude the South, as the smallness of the proposed indemnrity indicates its insincerity, and thefeld thus saggesbed for Souther enterprise may turn out a 'New Kansas,' that is, may be divided and oranied as free and not as alave States. "0So far , . Crippe. Ba t General Gadaden, who com. imuncates his letter to the publi, thinks his correspondent mistaken about the Instructions, beanse the solem declaratdou of General Comonfort is filed in our State Department, that under no circumstanoe can he consent to ced another acr of national territory. Therefore, argues General Gadiden, it cannot be trae that Presdent Buchanan has directed Mr. Forsyth to make the alleged offer, for It would immediately p roduce r11-feeling between the two countries. Now, there are very strong reasons for supposing that M[r. Cripps is right. In the first ce,yhe isin Mexioo andt n constant inteourse with Mr. Vorsyth. Moreover, General Gadaden vouches for the cor. rectness of Mr. Cripph's information Then the Mexican pape in the interest of the Governmaent have very dis tinoly told Mr. Buchanan, sas well as the public In Mexico and the United States, that Comonfort's Administration must have money and looks to this Government for it, and Is prepared to make great sacrifices to obtain it. Notwithstanding the declaration filed in the State Department, it May veywl be that the President has thought that $50,000,000might sha1ke'the patriotic determina-tion of omonfort and the Mexican people, and acordiugly laid the one atther fet. he inacial crisis has un- Fromn Vera Cruz we learn that the codudac(, which was to leave Guanaxuato for Mexico City onL the 5th of October, was detained there for want of a sufficient esort ; troops were expected from the city. This detention, it is said, would prevent the conducta reaching Vera Cruxz before the end of November. The Yew York7 Times speaks of the probability of another outbreak in Central America owing to an offlcer in the Costa Rican service having takon possession of the San Juan river under in'ructions from his Government; he had announced its blockade to the authorities at Greytown, and bad refused to allow Nicaraguan craft to pass up or down. The same officer, Colonel Cauty, has also been directed to demand of the Commandant of San Carlos the custody of that fort2 and in case of refusal to enforce its surrender. It is alleged, by way of reason for this act, that Walker was contemplating another Invasion of Nicaragua, and that a Costa Rican army alone was capable of defending the republic. Walker, the Filibuster, had, it is said, yielded to the monetary pressure, aud abandoned his hostile schemes. His announced purpose was to place himself at the head of an expedition of emigrants with the purpose of fonnding colonies based on military princlples. In the meantime, the stories of " vast sums of treasure" colUected sad levies of men prepared for this enterprise, turn out to be the merest gasconade. A large force was reported ready and eager for embarcation somewhere in Texas. The local journals declare the men to be " buckram,," and the supplies and materials to be moonshine. According to the New York Courier and Bnquirer of the 7th, the rates of exchange on England aud France had advanced materially. Bankers' bills on London were 108 to 109; and in some instances 109 was demanded for those of 60 days sdght. The chief difficulty was the deranged state of the domestic exchanges. Checks on New Orleans Cincinnati, St. Louis, Charleston, Chicago, and many other points were negotiated with difficulty, and the rates on each place varied considerably from day to day. Banks and commercial firms having funds at the above and other points would not convert them into New York- funds except at a severe loss. Baltimore funds were 'c. to 9c. per cent. discount, and Philadelphia Sc. to 6c. The following were the current rates at Philadelphia :- New York exchange, 3ito 4 pm.; Boston exchange, 3 to 4 pm.; Baltimore exchange, 2j to 3i discount; American gold, 3i to 4i pm. There was no eventual relief In the moneymarket. The banks had not commenced to act upon any general plan, and the merchants having in the meantime heavy payments to make were compelled to resort to the brokers. The operations at the Stock Board were on a large scale, and there was altogether more buoyancy among bu-yera and sellers. The United States Six per Cents, had beesn nearly exhausted by the Treanuy at the large premnum offered. The quotations for them were merely nominal, as there were no sales. Reading Railroad shares were aain advancing, and nearly every stock on the lists showed better price. Ohio Sixes of 1876 had improved 1i; Virgina, 6 ; Georgia, 2; sles of North Carolina at 824, an advance of 124; Missouri Sixes were quoted 3 per cent. better; Californis State loans were hI better request at 60, in view of the popular vote there as to taxation for paying Interest. Pennsyl vania Five per Cents. were improving steadily, and were nearly equivalent to a 6 per cent. stock par. Tho offerings of Indiana bonds were larger than the i demand.

TEH INDIAN MUTINIBS. THE STORM4 OF DELHL The following is from art Engineer Officer :- "' The Camp, Deli, Sept 21 to Sept. 27. "Here we are at last, thank God, having kie}ed out those rascals neck and crop after a twelve days' attack. The 14th was the storming day, as I told you, and I got knoked over the day before, which prevented my being present. We lost about 64 ofmicers and 1,100 men out of 3,000 who went in. Some men say there never was harder fightin, and when we got inside the brutes disputed every 3noh, till yesterday we shelled them out of the palace, charged, and took It with no loss, and all the villalns in the city bolted; It is all ours now. Our men have been really most humane; they would not kill a single man who was not a Sepoy, andIam glad to say not a wooman or child was touched; but when I saw sturdy brutes of men, the vey alass who committed all the atrocities, allowed to pa&s out I could not help wishing some of the soldiers would drive their bayoneto through them; but I did not say so out loud, as they are very apt to take you at your word. " Sept. 23. 'We have all moved down to a capital house on the banks of the river In the city; the breeze is dellghtful, and we are all getting as fat and jolly as if we were at home. We are getting on capitally; we have got the King-the great Mogul-prisoner, and are only waiting for leave f-rom Calcutta to hang him. His eldest son and hetr, Mi Mlogal Beg, a moat infernal scoundrel, who set the ex. ample of murdering the Europeans, was caught and shot like a dog, and his son, a man of about 20 year old, as weU as the Kng's second son, Mizza's brother. I aaw aU the three bodies exposed in the Kotwallle this morning. I am happy to say we are not so lenlent as wwe wre. Two of our native Sappers were murdered in the city, so we went out and hunted up about 50 or 60 men-thorough rascals, and our men have beon shooting them ever since. I saw 24 knocked over, all tied together against the walls; and when you hear those wretches, when they see they have no chance, coolly tell you ' Well, you may shoot me if you like; I killed three Europeans in the glorious massacre,' you loes all horror at the sight, and only Wsh they bad cats' lives to take them alL Only four Victoria crosses have yet been given in the army-one to Lieutenant Hoome, Engineers; one to Lieutenant Salkeld, Engineers; one to Sergeant Smith, Sappers and Miners; and one to a bugler in Her Majesty's 52d. So you see we got three out of the four in our corpe. Poor Salkeld is so badly wounded I am afraid he will never wear his. However, the red riband has been better than any medicine. I am sure I would have given my left arm for it, and I might have had a chance, as I should most probably have been with Salkeld, blowing up the Cashmere-gate, had It not been for that wretched grape the night before. . . . We are wonderfully comfortable in our new house; It was a powder manuiactory in the days of the Mogul, and consequently our servants acedentally blew us up the other day, and kiled one of themselves. But these little excitements are necessary. After being threo months every day under fire, the change is so great that we were thinking of paying men to fire at us daily, and so let ourselves down to a quiet life by degrees. . I have given up walking about the back streets of Delhi, as yesterday an officer and myself had taken a party of 20 men out patrolling, and we found 14 women with their throats cat from oar to ear by their own husbands, and laid out in their shawls. We caught a man there who said he saw them kldled for fear they should fall into our hands, and showed us their husbands, who had done the best thlng they could afterwards, and killed themseve. We took about 280 cannon, with shot, &c., for about three years. Without artillery they are no good; with It no despicable antagonists. There are no better gunners any. where, as we discovered in this idege. By returns we lost 1,350 men and 64 officers during the assaults only. Tolerably bloody work. Our loss in the assault, out of 18 officers on duty, was 1 oi3icer kilUed (poor Tandy), 10 wounded, many severely; one, I fear, mortally; 1 the day before the assault, 1 after. Total 13, out of 18; a tolerable number, for there were 7 or 8 who were on another part of the work whom I don't count, and who are on the strength to as;sit the unhappy remaining 5now. I am glad to say there Is not much work for us just now. At present, indeed, cut up as we have been, we oould not do It if we had muoh; as, what with officers thoroughly done up since with fever, and others sent out with moveable columns, our 26 for duty are reduced to 4." An officer of ler Majestv's 52d Light IDfantry, writing from DelM on the 22d of September, says:- "The wounded men are all going on beautifuly, and the weather is comparatively cooL Fever is disappearing, and the men are coming out of hospitaL At one time we had actually 340 men sick out of about 620; we now have only about 150, counting wounded. We lost one officer IdlledBradshawe, a very fine young fellow, who fell charging a gun in the streets." The following is an extract of a letter from Mr. George Palmer, of the Bengal Civil Service, who served as an officer in the Artillery Divislon of the Essex Yeomanry previouis to his return to India in January, 1857 - "Camp Shamlee, in the Mozuffernuggur District of the North West Provlnces, Sept. 13, "Since I last wrote I have had a very busy week and very hard work. Two days after I wrote to you I received the most unexpected intelligence that there was a large force of Goojurs assembling actually within 2 miles of my camp, and that they intended to attack the town of Mee. ranpore, in which I was encamped, that same night. This was about 3 o'clock p.m. I at once sent out a patrol to ascertain the truth of the teport, which returned by half. past 4 vith the news that it was not merely correct but that Dhaliel Singh, their most influential chieftain, was there in person, with 50 or 60 of his retainers. I at onoe mounted my detachment of Irregular Cavalry (20 sabres), leaving a non-commissioned officer and four men in charge of their tents, &o., and with two or three native gentlemen galloped off to the village where the Goojurs were gathering, leaving orders for all the police that were available to follow as soon as possible. The news of my approach broke up the meeting,andwhetwe reached the village the Goojurs were flying In all directions. So, leaving my native revenue officer, who accompanied me, to do all that was necessary there, with a native cavalry officer and seven troopers, I galloped on in the direcion of Bypoowa, the town in which Dhaiiel Singh lived, with the remaider of my men. After a gallop straight on of nearly nine miles, through a terribly wet and heavy country, I came in sight of his party about 1,000 yards outsde the little town. Only three men were then up with me, and they (the enemy) seeing this, made a stand; so I waited and breathed our horses until I was joined by seven or eight more of my men, and then went at them. They did not stand, but as soon as we came near them bolted into the town, and gob in before we, with our fagged horses, could get at them. We knocked over two of the hindermost matchlookmen, one within five yards of the houses, who had an old Government musket made by Mortimer. It was impossible for us to enter the town with only a handful of cavalry, so we contented ourselves with two or three shots at long range, which cleared the top of Dhallel SlngWhslittle fortified house in the middle of the town, and then, as it was past sundown, retired. "The next day I was told thatavery large body of Goojurs was being organized to attack me. I had thought this possible, and sent in at once to Moerut for aid; but neither from thence or from my own head-quarterswas it possible to send any, so we prepared for anuattack, I called upon the native gentlemen and townspeople to supply all the force they could, posted pickets outside the town, and threw out cavalry videttes on the two roads from which danger was apprehended, made barricades in some places and preparations to stop the ways with carts, &o., if necssary, and got out an old native gun mounted on a cart body, which I posted in the centre of the town, ready to move upon any point. "We were under arms all night; in the course of it I sent out three patrols, but it passed off without the attack threatened, although we had a false airm occaioned by a little private fighting in the town. I suppose the Goojurs must have heard that I was prepared for them, and thought better of their warlike intent. "¢The next day I got an order callig me to go intly with all the force we could muster on this xide of the dis trict, where evil of a more serious Ind ws threatened. I marched all nigat, notwithstanding we were up the whole nrght before, reached Mozuffernggu about 4 o'clok a.m, and found that we had to march again the same eveni which we acoDrdingly did at 9 p.m., reaching, th place half-past 10 a.m. the next moring, having had to cr a rapid river (the Hindun), which neitted the unloading of waggons and the taking to pieces of our guns-a terribb operation in the dark, vwith no one who knew how to do t but myself, If you look at a Urge map ot the North-Wes Provinces you wi see that we are nearly In the centre of this part of the strip of country lying between the riven Jumnna and Hindun-the trem we had to crosm. "A a la rge town (Thana Csevwen) about 12 miles due north of this, the ohief man, a bigoted Mahomedan, had raised the green faig, and ince plundered some ammunition most arelessly sent by the road paing through it, nd has, I just hea, turned out our ofadala And plundeed our tzee sury In the south a man called Kirai Khan, an old Pindaree, fired upon and drove away a party of 25 troopers who went with an European offioer to eolect the rScmlue, aDd afterwards advanced upon a large town, whioh wM Ong of our police atations, turned out our police, and occupied It In the namne of the King of Delhi. "' Our force now consists of the folowing :-90 men (Goorkhas) of the Nusseeree Battalion, 30 troopers of the 3d Cavalry(nativo), 90 troopers of the Ist Punjab Cavary, 2 mountain train guns, or rather one 3-pounder gun and one 12-pounder howitzer. "Our party of officers consists of Mr. Edwards, the magistrat, of the district, under whose orders of course tho force acts; Mr. Cnyler, who commands the detaohment of Goorkhas, and whom we look upon as virtually in mibitary command of the whole force; Captain Galloway, coi manding the 3d Light Cavalry; Mr. Low, a young civilian, a son of old General Low, formerly the resident at Lucknow, a very good fellow, who joined us with 50 troopers of the Punjab Cavalry doing duty with him; and myself, who have charge and command of the guns. So, you see, my education In this respect, under good old SergeautMajor Iavesey, in the artillery division attached to the RseX Yeomanry, has been most valuable. " They aent us from Meerut the guns, the trails fastened to mule hafts, drawn by post horses with only 50 rounds a gun, and no artillerymen. However, 12 of the Goorkhas were told off to work the guns; but with the best wMi in the world they cannot learn their work In a day. All the ammunition was in boxew, laden upon a large Government store cart, and from the time it took us to get the cart unpacked and the rauty plns taken out of the shafts, we calculated that we could not possibly bring the guns into aotlon under two or three hours; so Imet to work, sad fortunately found two lttle swivel guns and limbers belonging to a friendly Nawab, the limbers of which I found would do for my little guns, and the day I wa st Meorut had them fitted up with partitions for shot and shell, and so now work the guns with bullocks-a pair to each gun. In the limbers I carry 18 rounds for the howitzer and 21 rounds for the gun. I have also arranged that a spare box of ammunition for each gan is carried on an elephant, with spzre rammers, poles for dinging the guMs, &c., the rest following in the big waggon; so that now, if I had but men, the little guns would be as effective as they can be, " The day before yesterday we went out at a big disaffected village, which was first surrounded by the cavalry, and then entered by the infantry. A few shots were fired, which made me unlimber, and lay my guns upon an old fort in the centre and light may slow matches; it was a false alarm, but quito enough to show me how very unsteady and unfit for artllerymen are my little Goorkhas, We took a great deal of stolen property, in defence of some of which a small party which hiA lagged il the rear had a skirmish, and killed two of their as3ailants. Hardly had we bathed and sat down to dinner on our return, thoroughly knocked up, when we received intelUgence that our friend, Kharttl Khan was within five miles of us, and meant to attack Us in the night. We were very tired, and so we went to bed, having thrown out pickets and given all necesary orders in case of an alarm. Surely enough, about 1 o'clock in the morning, my servant seized me by the leg, and awoke me with the nevws that they were actually In the city of Shamlee. In five minutes every man was at his post. One side of our camp was protected by a broad piece of water, and the Goorkhas were thrown out in skirmishing order along the other three fronts, sapported by detachments of the cavalry. My men were so very unsteady that I agreed with Cuyler that It would bo better not to attempt to use the guns-so we dimounted them, putting the linchpins and rammers away, and send. ing the gunners with their comrades as sldrmishers. Strong cavalry patrols had gone out at once, and all Idnds of rumours came Into us, but no enemy ; at last the cavalry returned, having examined all the roads and reported that no enemy could be discovered. Yesterday we were to have marched on Boorhanah, the town from which our police were expelled, but one of our party was so il with fever, that we deferred it till to-night. By the delay we gain a material accession to our force-I15 Sikhs, new levies, wild mnen, capital material, but undrill6d and badly armed. We intend to march first upon the town of Boorhanah, and, unless the rebels bolt at our approach, to take It, and an old fort whioh they now occupy, this will give us the command of the Eindun river and a sfe line of retreat, which we have at present upon either Mozuffernuggur, or a place called Ehatowly, on the Meerut road, and froma thence, if we are strong enough, we shall attack the rebels, or, if not, wait unftl additional force is sent from Moerut to strengthen and co-operate with us. We daily expect to hear news of the fall of Delhi, &o. The heavy sdege train and last reLnforcements from the north had arrlved, and the batteries advanced between 200 and 300 yards of the plae". "Mozuffernuggur, Sept. 22. "I wrote to you from a place called Shamloe on the 13th inst., where our little force then was. I take an opportunity of a qulet day to give you a further account of our subsequent movements. On the night of the 13th of Sep. tember we marched from Shamlee upon a town on the Hindun river called Boorhanah, from whlch our pollce had been expelled. Soon after dawn we came abreast of a village caled Jowlabh, belonging to the King of Delhi, and before the head of our column had cleared it large numbers of men, both horse and foot, emerged from the village, and were seen coming down upon our flank; they were armed with matchlocks, swords, and spears, and came on with drums beating and with loud shouts In a long irregular line. Our cavalry of the advanced and rear guards went at them forthwith, taking them on both flanks, cut down and shot a good number, and drove the rest Into the illag, into which the irregular troopers and Affghan levies followed them. In the meantime the infantry and my guns came up as fast as they could, and I was well pleased to find that my bullocks and little guns could get along so welL On our arrival the infantry scoured the village, killing all whom they found, and ultimately set fire to it. I took-up a position outside. In about an hour, after ovr wild men had sated themselves with plunder, and were with difficulty collected, we returned to our baggage,'which had been left with but a slender guard, and resumed our march, having given the rascals a thorough chastisement. When we reached Boor. hanah we were given to understand that the old fort was still garrisoned by about 80 men. It was very hot, the mien were much done up, and we could find no good place from which to shell it; so the infantry went in at once to the main gate, which was found shut and firmly secured. I brought up my little guns by hand, and after loading the howitzer with grape, to bo ready in case of a rush upon the guns, I blew in the wicket after sundry discharges with powder only from the gun, and the infantry poured in, but to our sur. prise found it empty. The garrison, It seems, had bolted as soon as they heard of our successful scrimmage at Jowlah. That night we encamped outside, leaving the Sikhs and Affghans [in the fort as a garrison, and the next day we were relnforced by 100 Slkhs and two Horse Artillery guns from Meerut. But we heard on the same day the melancholy news of our post at Shamlee (which had been garrisoned by what was considered by the native officer in charge an ample ntumber of men), having been attacked by the Musulmans of atown oalled Thna BhbAwn, carried, the pace burnt, and all our offioials and all their force (amounting to upwards of 100 men) destroyed. The Mussulmans had come in great force with three little guns. We marched at once on Shmalee, which, as we expected, we found evacuated by the enemy, and it was decided by the offlcer In command to advance upon and attack Thana Bhawan. We marched at 2 o'clock a.m., but on the receipt of intel. ligence that our own central station of Mozuffurnuggur ws threatened by the enemy the advance was abandoned, and we marched into Mozuffurnuggr-21 miles. The next night we marched at 6 p.m. on Thana Bhawun, the advance guard being formed of 70 of the 1st Punjab Cavalry, then 120 Goorkhas, the two Horse Artillery guns, followed by my gmus, then 150 Slkhs and Affghan levies, and for the rear guard about 50 of the 1st Punjab Irregular Cavalry. The road was very bad, and we had to cross the river Hindun again by night, and reached Thana Bhawun about 8 a.m. W found the enmy in goed numbers outside the town, in the gardens and on little eminences, which were ea3ily cleared by a few shot and shell from Frser's guns. The whole force then advanced crossing a nullah about a quarter of a eile in front of the town, when they openod upon us, their first shot klling a cavalry horse. Our guns were first opened with shot and shell upon the main gate, over which they had a sort of bation, and afterwards advanced nearer, firing grape, the suburbs upon either flank being occupied a cleaed by the infiatry, who advanced close up to the walls; but, as the gmns had no command, very littlo effect was produced, except the withdrawal of the enemy's two guns; and, as it was xoou olar that the musk-e A" from the wals wa not being reduced, and we had already had an officer and one or twomenhil, this attack wabandoned. Much about this time I got my little guns into action fur. ther to the left, clearing a garden in which a number of the enemy had assembled with a round shot and a shell that would have well pleased our old friend Sergeant-Major Liveeoy, and sent a few more rounds into a big house on the city walls, which seemed occupled by a good many of the enemy. Then the Hom. Artillery guns came up and sent some more shot and shell into the city. It was now decided that an mault should be tried, and acordingly an aultng column of Sikhs and Ghoorka was gob together, and advaned, under Captain Smith and Mr. Cuyler, through the sburs, which they fired, covering their own advnoe, bat at the sme time effectualy preventing us from seeing their movements. We were All astonished and disguted at the backwardness of the Sikhs and Ghoorkas, wrhom we had alwys thought not defioient in pluek4 They geOi hld4ng In all possible place, and it seems that only about 50 In all followed their offioers, who got into the town, drove back thelr oppononts, and took two guns. Every one outside exerted themselves to the utmost to get supports to go in, but not a man would go, As soon as they were collected or this Purpose they melted away; added to this, that from the smoke and crackling of the burning thatch we could neither see our asultlng party nor hear their bugles, and after about 20 minutes, finding it Impoaible to get MIeL to follow any of us in, it was necessary to recall them, nad as I rode to do so Imet them coming out, having been driven back by the enemy, who rallied when they saw how few there were, and that they were unsupported. They had lost about 25 men killed and wounded, including Captaiu Smith, Who was badly shot in the arm, a native offioer killed, nother mortally wounded; altogether, our low bad amounted to 16 killed and 20 wounded. There was then nothing for It but to retire, which was done after a short halt on the other side of the nullah in good order, the bggage being sent firs "About four miles from Thana Bhawun, is we came op. posite a large village called Lohane, a great number of armed men issued from that place and came down upon our left flauk, probably seeing the baggage and thinking that the whole column was in disorder, but we speedily unde. ceived them, the Iregulars and the Affghan levies charging them in three separate parties under Low, Melville, and myself. We cut up about 60 or 70 of them in about ten minutes and dispersed the rest, but unfortunately Low, with more spirit than eaution, followed them into the village and got Into a scrape, having his reins out and himself severely wounded in three plces. After this we oon. tinued our march unmolested to the river Hindun, which we crossed and bivouacked for a couple of hours, and then Went on to Mozaffurnuggur,which we reached at 12 o'clock p.m., having thns marched 36 miles, besides a hard das's fighting. Our total loss was 16 kIlled and 23 wounded, in. oluding three English and two native officers. Our foroe consisted Qf 160 cavalry, 200 infantry, two Horse Artilery guns, and ]P two gan Sept.23. "This day a force, consisting of English cavalry and riflemen, 300 Sikhs, two 9-pounders and two 6-pounder gans, and four small mortars, have arrived from Meerut to enable us to smash Thana Bhawun. The foroe wil much this night, and, I doubt not, do the work well. The Ghoorkas are to stay and garrison this place (Mozuffurnuggur), and my two little guns, which are worked by their comrades likewise. I shall, however, accompany the foree in my civil capacity alone. We have received at lut the news of the complete oocupation of Delhi by our troops, and last night fired a salute in consequence; bat I fear oar people have suffered very severely. JUBBULPORE. The following is from J'ubbulpore, dcated October 8- " I will now give you, as well as I can rooollect, an account of my escape and the motlny of the regiment. On the morning of the 18th of September I got an express from M--, dated September 17, 8 p.m., saylng that they had every reason to believe that the regiment intended to mutiny that night, and to take the treasry and magazine with them, aswell as torelease all the prlsoners. The letter went on to say that I was to act to the best of my judgment, and that the Colonel would bear me out in anything I did or ordered. I at onoe told my men; some would not believe it, but all took the native oath to remain true, and under those circustanom I had not the heart to leave them. I told them I did not wish them to fight the regiment, as I made sure it would come my way to proceed to Mirzapore. I wianted, on the arival of the regiment, that one man should go and tell them that my company would not joln them; at the same time I felt sure that if the whole regiment had mutinied my men would not stand. I got no more news that night. I did not sleep at all, but at daylight I went outside, and by the gloomy looks of the men and their talking together knew that something was up. I walkedamong them for some time, longing to seenmy native officer, at last he came; I asked him what was the matter; he threw up his hands and said, 'The regiment hag gone, and these men won't obey, but are going off to DelhL' I said I should order them to march into Jubbulpore; he said, 'Y ou had better not; mount your horse and be off.' I then saw that nothing but a bolt would save us, so I went and caled C-, ordered our horses, put on my revolver, and took my double rifle, giving my gun to C-. I saw we could not leave without being seen, so I thought I had better go away openly. We found our horses saddled outside, and a number of my men all ro-nd them. I saw they had put a sentry over my traps and the Government treasury. I walked quietly up the road followed by some of my better disposed men; they saluted me, andmany wanted to shake hands; some actually cried, but not a single man offered to accompany me, so hopeless did they consider my escape to be. On we rode at a foot pace for fear of tiring our horses, expecting to see the mutinous regiment at every turn of the road. After going 15 miles we arrived at a village, where we heard that the regiment had really gone, but were not coming this way. I found a dozen Irregular Cavalry there, nd, though I could not trust them, I knew If they wanted to murder us they could always over. take us, so I ordered them to mount and come on with us. and made them bring along whatever Government treasure there was in the vilage, and after having a draught of mllk, on we went, having first sent on a trooper at a gallop with a letter to say we were coming. At every village through whicL we passed the people turned out and only looked at us, as our small cavalcade looked too strong for them. When we got within a few miles of the station we found a buggy which had been sent out for us, and a couple of bottles of beer. It was quite dark and pouring, having rained nearly all day. I was glad to see the buggy, as we then knew that the station was all right. We arrived at last at about half. past 9 o'clock, and were received with cheers. Of course every European was in the Residency, and ladles In all stages of undress rushed out of their rooms to shake hands. My dress consisted only of a coloured flannel shir and can. vass trousers, shoes, and a leather hat, besides being dripping wet, so that I myself was not very presentable. I then heard that poor Macgregor had been taken prisoner, but all were in great hopes that he would be released, as a free pardon and 5,000 rupees were offered to any party who would bring him in. As soon as the Madras column heard of the regiment going they retraced their steps, and on the 27th, as they were marching through some very thick jangle, they were attacked by our regiment and about 1,000 Bundeelas. They were only two marches off, and we could hear the guns plainly. The mutineers were driven back with some loss-those who were taken prisoners were hung up at once, to the intense delight of the European artillerymen. Poor Macgregor ws murdered that morning, he was found with his arm broken, five bayonet wounds, and a shot through the neck. He was brought in, and we buried him with the usual military honours. He was our senior lieutenant, and had been brought up at the school I was at at Worthing. I was one of the committee of adjustment of his estate, and had to go to his old quarters, where everything reminded me forcibly of him, and although we were not great friends, it is most distressing, after being for nine years together, to see a brother officer lose his life in so terrible a manner. It was only on hearing of his horrible fate that I could realize my providential escape, and I am convincod that if Ihad waited five minutes I should have been made a prisoner. That day was an eventful one for me. I can assure you that it is not a comfortable feeling to be surrounded by men who, after being under one's command for so many yearsm suddeRly throw off all obedience and discipline. I felt so perfectly powerless, bedides having a junior officer with me whose life depended on my acts. On steeng how things were going on I thought perfect coolness our best safeguard, and this I kept up to the time of leaving Sleemanabad. I left orders with the company to provide carriage for my tents and traps, and called to my colour-sergeant to bring me whatever money he had of mine. To my great surprlse he brought it, and I put the money in my belt. Two dave after mY arrival here in came my things-nothing misdng; so they actually obeyed my last order. . . . . . Some of our mon are being brought in prisoners and hung. Twro men of the ist company came in this morning; they could not look me in the face. I hear they have just been hung. .Gr . . . Great ditsatiscon is felt at the order that no Sepoy is to be hung except it is proved that he was present at a murdor. Who is to bear witnes to the murders of our unfortunate countrymen at Cawnpore, Fattehghur, Shahjehanpore, &c. ?I

Matter, have taken a decidedly favourable trn, and, if the pressure has not altogether subsided, It may be safely predicted that all banking difflicultiex that had to be encountered in Ireland will have been surmounted before, perhaps, the close of the current week. The Eaening Post of last night has the following satisfactory report * " With repct to Ireland we have nothing but satisfo tory re=s, with the exoeption of an Insae I'run' for gold in trick and Cork. The foolish excitement hoa, we learn cased In TiHppra. Having been so free from the pani aUl through,- have had comparatively little interest in the Atep taken to check it in Geat Britain. Here there has not been a single fhilure of Any ODn- snuece; and we have awcertained that the eommernW bills due on the 4th of the present month In Dublin, which were lrger in amount than nsual, were met with great promptitude and punctuality. Mercantile credit is so wel maintained that the notaries have sarely any busines in the shape of protests. For several weeks past the investments In the funds have so much increased that a vast number of new accounts have been opened a tthe Bank of Ireland, and the average amount of stock Imported from England has been about 100,0001. per week. Of course difficultiles could not long exist in EngIaud without affecting this country in some degree, especalmy in our cattle and provison trade; and we are glad, therefore, that there is a Srospet of gradual susidence of the excitement prouce by the unancial crisis. Wo learn that the panic having ceased altogether in Sootland, the Glasgow banks are about to send back to London lr,ge quantities of gold. The thoughtless excitement in Li.ierlk and Cork will very soone at an end, and the banks will be at the trouble and expene of transmitting the surplus gold to the Bank of EnwAnd." There are several accounta to-day from Belfast, where it may be remembered the presure was rather severely felt at the close of last week. The Northe,n Whig, the leading oDmmercal paper, savay,- "In Belfast, as elsewhere, the power granted to the Bank of England has tended to restore confidence Among al classe4. Our local banks continue to dbcount bl sa in ordinary times; and, beyond the prioe that has to be paid for money, no inconvenience Is experienced. The utmost reliance is placed by depositor in the banks- and we are Slad to learn that among the agricultural classes-who aloneexhibited any apprehension-the tem- rary panic Is rapidly subsiding. We have heard of several = oes of farmers who had withdrawn their money relodging It, from a feeling that It was not as safe with them as it would be in the bank cofters. The excitement and alarm are rapidly subsiding here and it is easy to perceive prevatamore healthy state of the public mind is beginning to The Banner of Ulster remarks "The banks, sustained by the wealth and moral Influence of the gentry, clergy, and merchants of Ulter, have mean sufficient not only to meet the commercial necesities of the community, but also to aid others who are at present pressed by the urgency of the times. No complaint has reached us of the want of accommodation - on the oontrary, we have heard several merchants say tY could obta more than they require. Strange to say. deposlts have incremed in all our local banks durin the last three weeks, and the amount of gold received has been con siderably above that obtained during the same period last year. Itisalsoa that not a aiulefallre has taken plce in Belfast. The farmer are acting wisely in holding hack their produce unti pricesimprove which wil sfurely take pla in the course of the next month or the beg n of the new year, when weexpect to see discounts down to6 per cent." Thi lourishing statement is, however somewhat qualified by a paragraph in the same paper, showing the depressed state of the sewed muslin trade of Belfast :_ "Since the failure of D. and J. Macdonald and Co., of Glasgow, this trade has been in a very depressed condition. The principal houes in Belfast and throughout UIlter have rednoed their staff to the lowest possble point and have all but ceased to print goods, An immense number of workers have been thrown out of profitable employment, and many of them are now in very straitened circumstancem Stooks in the hands of manufacturers are large and unsaleable. We understnd that two lots were lately 'put up' in London by tender-one, invoiced at 2,0391. realizedl. 463. 10s. I the other, Invoiced at 3,276., only brought 7301. 1 Ruinous as those prices are, we are informed that another large lot of embroidered goods wiU be offered for sale to-dav in the same place and under similar circumstanoes. We have heard that the entire stock of a Glasgow house wlU be thrown on the market immediately; buyers wiiU therefore have an opportunity of supplying themselves with embroidered goods at prices much below thoee of any previous period." Referring to the recent run for gold on the Belfast banks the Mercury observeas- "The farmers of Ulster, we hope will learn a little common sense, and not listen to bad advisers. We have heard of several who have drawn their hard earngs out of the banks in gold, and we would like to know what they will do with their gold-sit up day and night to guard it? Let them, like sensible men, return it to their banks as soon as possible, and not expose themselves to the danger of being robbed. There are plenty of loose members of society prowling about. ht whom the temptation of plunder ought not to be offered. It is right to observe that the farmers of Ulster generaly have not evinoed any distrust of the bank, only a few foolish dthere acted in so rdiculous a manner, and v t Ii theydfo notsuffer loss by having given t hthe accounts are hardly lees satisfactory. The Cor- Coii-stituion of yesterday says "On Friday Saturday, and yesterday there was a smart run upon the rovincial, and also to some extent on the Bank of Ireland, and National Banks in this city, the applicants being principlly country people. On Saturday morning a Provincial note was refused to be taken in one of the leading commercial towns of this country. The run, of course, was promptly met by all banks, and it is believed that the groundless apprehensions of the country farmers have now nearly subsided. There was also a ran on the savings-bnk on Saturday, a very lrge number of country depositors having withdrawn the amounts to their credit. The feeling, however, is entirely oonfined to the lower classes, and principally to country people. In the city and among the leading traders in the country towns the fullet confidence is felt in the banks. From the accounts which have reached us from other parts of the country it would appar that, although there were symptoms of apprehension in Lmerick Belfast. and other places, they were confined, as in this city, to classes of persons not possessed of sufficlent discrimiation to judge between safety and peril In most places there has been a complete cessation of the run which took place in the early part of the week." The sane paper contains the following account of the suspension of the eminent house of Scott and Co., of Queenstown, with liabilities extending from 100,00lO. to 200 0001.:- "In the early part of last week it was currently stated In commercial circles that the extensive firm of Messrs. Scott and Co., of Queenstown, had incurred considerable embarrassment with regard to the liquidation of their Iabilites, but It was positively asserted by their friends that the difficulties would be only of a temporary character, and that if time were allowed aUlthe creditors would be paid in falL With this object in view efforts were made to induce the creditors in this country and In England to sign a letter of license for three yea. This was complied with by some, but others declined making any terms until a statement of the affairs of the firm was id before them. The result has been that ciroblars were issued on Saturda evening for a meeting to be held on Thursday next The debts of the firm are set down at varions sums, extending from 100,0001. to 200,000L A very large number of creditors belong to this city and county, but there are also some heavy liabilities in England and America. It was supposed that the firm was possessed of considerable property in ships as wellasbuildings in Queenstown; but the latter, It is stated, are mortgaged, and the former Is not so extensive as was beIHeved, as many of their ships were disposod of within the past few years. The firm of Messrs Scott and Co. had during their connexion with Queenstown exerted themselves very actively for the advancement of the town, and were maily instrumental in carrying out most of the improvements which have latterly been effected therein. The handsome row of houses which meets the eye of the visitor on his entrance into the harbour, which includes the Queen's Hotel, the Mgnec Telegraph-office and the Bank of Ireland, was built by this enterprng firm, who were also the chief agents in arranging for the lighting of the town with gas, and procuring a supply of water. The agricultural prospects in the Western province continue nnfavourable. A Mayo paper thus reportsep- "Often as we have discussed this topic, never did we *pP proach the subject surrounded by more perplexities, nor more gloomy foreshadowings. The most obtuse must observe the general depression in every produce of the soil wfhich has become consequent on the eventful mone- tay revolutions which shafie the foundations of our commerclal system, threatening its overthrow from the highest pinnacle; and, as a sequenoe, the tillers of land,. the growers of cattle, and the dealers in stock have in their various departments suffered a materil chec]r and a heavy blow has been dealt to their expectations. The sudden revuldon from high prices for cattle and sheep in the hands of stkoowoners, and of oats and wheat, and the abeence of demand at low prioes, has a most cheerless effeet. Itn mnst, however, be borne in mind that the .i, ot cattle have almost closed forithe seMon, so tht it is idle to speculate on the ctul lose which stookowners mraysuffer by the present penio. As to the prioes of eenals, the fall has been considerabe, but not to an extent to warnt the holding up of corn for higher prices, a such are not I}ely to occur for some months to come, and the present rats mnst tisdy growers Every article of consumption hag met a decided depreciation fin vaue, and we re of opinion thAt the tendeneywill be downward until hitm ,when American sulpplies will ceae to arve.

CUMBEWID RSTATES COURT. It appears private biddings have been made for about 70 Iota of the Thomond estates, the public sale of which was fixed for the early part of the next month. The offers an to be submitted to the Encumbered Estates Commisioners and it is said that the trustees of the late Marquis WMll recommend the Court to accept the tersw p od6flM for a good many of the lota-the pricea in the majority of instances being comidered by all Parties to be unprecedented high, even in the present florishing dtate of the Iilsh land-market. The gross sum bid by private speculators amounts to 105,0001. Yesterday a pox-ion of the gigantic property accumulated by the late Tohn Sadleir was put up for sle in the Encumbered Estates Court. This estate, which Is situated In the county of Tipperary, yields a profit rental of about 1,700l. a-year. It was purchased du the years 1851 and 1853, and comprises part of the G engall estates,which came Into Sadleir's hands in the latter year. For the whole of the Tipperary estates he (or somebody else) p'ad in round numbers the snT of 55,0001. The property was divided Into 19 lots-five of which were withdrawn for the precent, the others producing 58,9501. The rental of the adjourned lots is estimated at 3701. per annum. The first lot, Kilcommon, includes Colin-house and demesne, and brought 27,100Z. The purchaer was Air. Malcolmson, the eminent shipbuilder, of Portlaw, In the county of Waterford. The estates of Mr. Vincent Scully were then put up, but there being no biddings for several of the lots, the sale was adjourned at the instance of the solicitor for the officialmanager for winding up the affairs of the Tipperary Bank. PROsEcTION OF TrI} REV. MIn. co wIWy. The venue has been laid in the county of Mayo, and Mr. O'Hagan, QC., has been retained for the defence. According to a four-day rule Father Conway will have to plead on Saturday as the rule includes the day of Issue; but itis open to his counsel to apply to the Court of Queen's Bench, in which the proceedings have been instituted, for an extension of time, should it'be found that the character of the indictment rendered such a course necessary. THE LATE M. AUGUSTS STAFORD. The death of this gentleman, who filled an important position in the Administration of Lord larby In 1852, took place on Sunday evening at Mo}rlson's Hotel. The hon. gentleman had but lately arrived from Limerick, where he had been Bufering from the effects of cholie. At the request of his friends an inquiry into the circumstances of his death will take place. Mr. Stafford, who, in 18£7, by Royal license, assumed this name after the name of his ancestors, was the eldest son of' Mr. S. O'Brien, of Blatherweyke-park, Northamptonshire, and of Cratloe-woods, county Clare, by Emma, sister of the Earl of Gainsborough, and daughter of Sir G. Noel Noel, Bart., M.P., by Diana his wife, Baroness Barham. He was born in June, 1811; educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and filled the post of Secretary to the Admiralty from March to December, 1852. He contested Limerick unsuccessfullv in 1837, and was returned to Parliament in 1841 for North Northamptonshire, which constituency he has ever since continuedto represent as a Conservative and a Protectionist.

T1lE MONBTARY PREBSURE. WOLVERHAMPTON, Nov. 18. The efforts on the part of the mayor and other inhabitants to allay the rising popular feeling of distrust In the currency of the notes of the Wolverhampton and Staffordshlre Bank, of which there are 30,0001. worth afloat, have proved in a measure successful. There has been a feeling of growing confidence all the day, and the applications to the other banks of the town have not been many more than customary, and they have been met with the utmost readfness. Nevertheless, the inconvenience to the trading community has been severely felt. The market has been much more numerously attended than it has been for some weeks past. The surprlse was great on the part of many living in the raral districts when, on coming into town, they learnt for the frst time of the suspension of the bank. The ironmasters mustered in strong forco, but there was no business transacted. Although it seemed to be impossible that other suspensions should not foRow those of P. Charles Bery, W. Riley and Son, the Wolverhampton Iron Company, Solly. Brothe-s (Leabrook), and Rose, Higgins, and Rose, yet the only additional firm that has issued dr. culars caeling together their creditors was that of Mlotteram, Deeley, and Co., ironmasters. At the same time considerable apprehensions are expressed that the wages in several instanoes would not be forthcoming on Saturday night. Towards the close of the proceedings on 'Change in the afternoon it became generally stted that the bank would open to-morrow (Thursday), and more than one firm in the iron trade determined to forego their oriLnal intentiont of summoning a meeting of their creditors for at lead a few days longer. A telegraphic message had been recelved from the deputation of the directors who left Wolverhamp. ton lst night to procure additional accommodation from the Bank of England, reporting that their journey had been successfuL Depositors were at about the same time waited upon by persons largely interested in the maintenance of the bank, and their opinion taken whether, in the event of the bank re-opening to-morrow with the help adverted to, and a new board of directors, they would continue their money in the bank. The opinion of the depositors cannot. however, be fuly ascertained until to-morrow fore. noon, when, at 10 o'clock, a meeting of the creditors will be held at the bank. Until that meeting has taken plaoe we do not think that it can be definitely asserted that the bank wiU re-open to-morrow, The shareholders will meet on Monday. The liabilities of the bank are set down at a million sterling. The difficol. ties under which It has just temporarily succunmbed have arisen out of the accommodation which they have given to somewhat questionable paper preoipitated by the faUure of Messrs. Sanderson, Sandiman, and Co The business Is stated to have been from 10,000,0001. to 12,000,0001. a-year, and the 101. shares were selling a short time ago at 181. los.
TEE WESTERN BANK. (BY ELEoCrao AND MTE ATLONAL TEEGRLAPH.) GLASGOW, WEDNssD&Y. A meeting of the depositors was held here to-day in the Trades-hall, which was crowded to saffocation; Sir James Ferguson, of Eirkerran, presided. Mr. FLxEn{, the interim manager, stated that from a rough calculation made on the .Ah of November, the entire labilities of the bank amounted to 7,671,641., and the assets to 9,398,1841. It was resolred that the bank should be empowered to resumo buslness, and it was agreed that the transfer of shares should be closed till the annual meeting in June, 1860; that as soon as business was resmmed the directors should be authorized to pay 10g. to account on all deposits not exceeding 504, and to pay the whole of such sums as soon a5 possible after Januar (these small deposits amount to haf a million); that the interest on all doposits should be paid up to the 9th of November current; that the directors should hare a discretionary power of allowing operations on current deposit aceounts with parties engaged in business; that, sub. ject to these restrictions, all deposits above 504 should remain in the bank for two yean at an interesl of 5 per cent.; and that means should be taken to render these deposits available as a fand of credit to depositors.

FORBIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN COOtREPONDfx.) (The foUowiDg appeared iu our second edition of yes| tt rday :-I £ARIS, TUZSAY, Nov. 17, 6 P.M. It is said in semi-official quarters that the prospect of an understanding on the unpleasant question of the Principalities is all but certain, and that the comprornise to which I have more than once alluded is likely to be acepted by all the Powersl, including Turkey. It is affirmed that Redschid Pasha will offer no opposition to the plan of administrative union. The fact of the Ministerial journals having been recommended to utse conciliatory rather than irritating language when speaking of the Grand Vizier shows that there is some foundation for the statement. Despatchea have been received from the Admiral commanding the French fleet on the South Ameriean station announcing that the state of the Dominican Republic was such that the Admiral foLnd it necessary to interfere for the protection of the French residents. The following caution to emigrants proceeding to St. Domingo appears in the Aoniteur: *" A certain number of emigrants lately left France for St. Domingo, and another departure has been ennonnoed, Te accounts received as to the podtion of the first enigrant, not being favourable, French colonists wrll act wisely in adjourning their intention of establishing themselves In the Republic of St. Domingo." Several of the journals comment with asperity on the events that occurred on the capture of Delhi. The COnstituliomel says:- " Al Frenchmeen have read with surprise and indignation that passage from a letter of an officer of the victorious army of Delhi (and not in an oficial report, as was at first stated, owing to a mistake of the transltor), in which it is coolly narrated how all the inhabitants of the town who were met with by the English soldiery were put to deatbo The officer says: 'Forty or fifty persona had got together and concealed themselves in some houses; they were not mutineers, bat residents, who, relying upon our habitual clemency, hoped for pardon, I ans glad loway y were disappoissted.' Such an act and such a sentiment require no comment.. . ,, Our neighbours have latterly complained that they are not liked in Europe. We feel bound to tell them frankly that acts such as these arm net of a nature to conciliate sympathy for them in France. We cannot rejoice at their successes in India, unless they observe the laws of humanity, and maintain the honour of European civilization." The Univers exclaims " Disappointed/ What a dellcate expression to intimate the fact that the throats of these individuals were cut for no other reason bat because they resided in Delhi I The English journals, while gloating over details like these, with delight continue to protest against the cruelty of their enemies !" The Gazette de France, as might be expected, is more violent than any of the other journals ;- "We see in these atrocities, agaist which no voice bas been raised in the London press, a proof that England has renounced all hope of bringing back to submiBson to her sceptre this vast empire which has thrown off Its allegiance. The war is not one of repression or reconquest, it Is a war of extermination. England openly adopts the doctrines of terrorism, and puts them in practice in Hindoetan..... England is the only nation of the present day capable of stretching the rights of warfare to the extent of slaughtering, without mercy, the entire population of a city taken by assault, The sPectacle which she has given to the world plaoes her out of the pale of cdvill. zation and humanity. It is impossible to doubt that the sentiment of universal reprobation which she has exelted must have important consequences for her. She may conquer the Sepoys, but she cannot conquer the public opinion of Europe-she cannot conquer God. No, we will never believe that she can restore her rule over the Indian peoples by these horrible means. Conquests, unaccompanied by moderation, clemency, and that solicitade for the well-being of the subjugated people which springs from a sense of right, are never dura'ble. Attila, and other manslayers of his class, passed over the earth like a pestilence; they founded nothing, never conquered anythlng in reallty. And eo will it be with the English in India; the blood they have shed wVil cry out against them and engender new martyrs." It is a relief to the foregoing to quote the following remarks from the Presse:- " The English victory at Delhi, at 'which we rejoioe with aU our hearts, was acompanied by some acts of excessive severity. These acts are to be regretted; but let us beware of exaggeration; and, above all, let us avoid that ridioule whioh must ever attach to a display of indignation hn cold blood. We love clemency, we admire generosity, and we are not of those who-think that to strengthen the foundations of any power whatever it can be a good tbing to bathe them in blood. This, in our view, is bat an elementary teaching of morality, or, of what is the same thing, policy enlightened by experience. But, although these doctrine, cannot be too often called to mind in the face of partie3 who forget and Governments which violate them, can it in conscience be said that they are rigorously applicable in India, after the frightful tragedy which has been playing there for tbe last four months? Is it possible, is it just, to institute a comparison, as oortain journals have done, between tho Sepoys 3nd the English soldiers-between Nana Sahib and Geoural Havelock ? The Sepoys surprised and cut the throats of defenceless English-men, women, children-without allowing them time to escape to the mountain and the jungle, there to trust to the tenderer nnercies ot tigers and hyenas. The English showed no mercy to scoun. drels 'vho had ripped up, cut into pieces, burnt, and violatel their vives and children. There is, it appears to us, a very considerable difference between the two cases; and therefore the Spcclatevur very sensibly remarks 'When we think of the savage acts comsnitted by the Blindoos, and the horrible situation in which the English troops wvero placed for upwards of four months, one can neither wonder at their exasperation nor judge their conduct harshly.'" The appointment of M. de Royer as Minister of Justice, which I announced yesterday, is confirmed in this day's a rnbiteur, which publishes the decree of nominatioll. It is believed that MI. de Royer WilU be succeeded as Procureur-General at the Court of Cassation by M. Vaisse, who fDls the same post at the (our Imperiale; and that M. VaYsse will, in turn, be succeeded by M. Sibert Cornellon. The Annudire aqt Bureau, des Longitudes for 1858 publishes the following as the population of the 25 first cities and towns of France, according to the quinquennial census of 1856 :-Pari^^, 1,174,346; Lyons, 292,731 ; Marseilles, 233,817; Bordeaux, 149,928; Nantes, 108,530; ERouen, 103,222; Toulouse, 103,144 ; St. Etienne, 94,432; Toulon, 82,705; Lille, 78,641 ; Strasburg, 77,655; Metz, 64,727; Havre, 64,137; Amiens, 56,587; Brest, 54,293; Rheims, 51,725 ; Angers, 50,726; Montpelier, 49,737 ; Nancy, 48,199 ; Orleans, 46,922 Limoges, 46,564 ; Rennes, 45,654 ; Besancon, 43,544; Caen, 41,394; and Tours, 38,055. A volume has lately issued from the Paris prass entitled Deux A4-s de Revlutiom en ltalie. Of the many works which have been written on this sabject the present has the merit of presenting In a 0mm- took place in those two memortable years of European convulsion, 1848 and 1849. It is not marked by the fault attached to the others-that it is too voluminous or too diffuse, or that it is occupied with minute details, wbich possess interest onlV for an Italian. The general accuracy of the writer (M. Perrens, who is also the author of an interesting | biography of Savoiiarola, Which was honoured with the prize of the French Academy) has been acknow-I ledged by some of the most eminent among the Itallian refugees, such its the late MM. Main, Monrtanolli, Amn^ai, UJIIoa, Petrucelli, and others, anld whose author ty is the more valuable from the dif- terent ahacles o0t opinion existing between them, A strong love of liberty is expressed in the work, in spite of the restraint imposed on the French press. The conduct of the Pontifical Government, and the policy of the Neapolitan and Austrian rulers, are judged with due severity, and the author speaks with just praise of the institutions and liberal Government of Piedmont. The Italan revolution. is described successivelyin the different States of the Peninsula, contrary to the plan of Itaalan-writers, who u'sually take the whole of the events in chronological order, and the reader is consequently obliged to change at every page from M1ilan to Naples, from Rome to Turin, &c., so that it is difficult to form a complete notion of the events in any one of the States. The Italian question may be said to be still pending, and the present wyork ls an excellent manual of the incidents connected with it, and many of irliich have probably been iready forgotten. The scope of the work will perhaps be best understoqd from the fact of the Austrian and Neapolitan Governments having prohibited its crossing their frontiers. M Perrens judges with impartiality of, Italy and the ItaliAns. HOe ays- 'I,WlBat does ItAly see in itepast-the past which is yet so nea us 2 Generous efforti the result of a moment of enthusam, but not more lsting than their cause. Revolta, oonsplraiee, Governueut WMitout por or durtlop wbich could never make liberty take root in that soil. Citizens were thought to be found where men did not yet exist. An artificil and forced educhtion, imperfoot, and illogical, which does not penetrate to the inferior clas ses sn ill regulated enthusiasm, or a stolid indifference, equaly fatal; an incurable exaggeration, which has borne to the capital so many men of no great worth, and who were destined to be afterwards repudiated; a spirit of irsabordination, exhibited even in the army; an ab,olute ignoranco of the duties of the military obief; a mistrust of their own force, which was but thinly .fdisgjse4 under sonorous phraseology, and this, in spite of the ,undoubted bravery of a considerable number, renders the Itsalians unable by themselves to trlumph on the *battle.field; a violenoe of language which is too oftenfollowed bytinmidity in acton;such are the evils which this unhappy people, taught bj experience, have felt, and of which they must be cured if they do not mean to renew the straggle with ma little chance of succeas as before, Let the Italians, therefore, lose no time in improving their temper, and, if possible, improving the civil Institutions by which man is formed. With them an Ill-directed education up to the present leaves but few germs; agitation is wasted in unmeaning exhibitions, and attempts at organization always miscarry. Concord is but a vage aspirtion. Division is everywhere-between the subjects u well as Princes, be-. tween provinces, between cities, and even between the population of the same city. Nothing of that which oombined efforts alone could effect Is done. An Immensity has been said about corporations and leagues, but not one has been formed. It is in vain that wishes are expreesed for the union of Rome with Florence, Lombardy with Piedmont, Venioe with Iombardy, Sicily with Naples-concord has been found nowhere, not even on the field of battle. If some definitive results are obtained, it in by force of former treaties, or by the eagerness of Princes to bid the highest for popularity-the accession of the Dachy of Lucca to Tusan0, or the constitntion of Piedmont. All theme things have oaused the failure of Italy in favourable circumstanoes, which will not be presented for perhaps a long time to come. If she wishes to triumph soon, she will have to surmount obstacles far different from those of 1848. We do not find every dasy a Pope 'whose name may serve as a rallying word for agitation, a Prinoo ready to draw the sword, a revolution at Vienna to tie up tbe hands of the Austrlans, While they cherish for the future the fairest hopes, the Italians must for the present be modest, and act so that bravery shall no longer be the exclusive attributo of enlightened men, and that whhUe they educate themselves they shall extend Its benefits to the rural distriots, the indifference and pusilnimity of whose population they have had so often ooaslon to deplore. Since they desire to be saved by themselves, and without aid from abroad, let them teach their peuants, the worldng oaes, their tradesmen, that they are oitizens only inasmuch M they love their country with a love 'which raises the people en mase to defend it as France did in 1792." A private telegram received from Turin, and dated this day, states that the definitive elections la Piedmont knowrn up to this morninJg i;are 65, of which 42 are in favour of Mnisters, 3 doubtful, and 20 clerical. The Monitewr publishes the official Customs' returns for the month of October:- " The recelpts amounteod to 14,402,894f., being a decreae of 2,121,891f. on the corresponding month of last year, The produce of the first 10 mon!ths of the present year, as compared with the corresponding period of 1856, shows an improvement of 9,280,469f., the total reoeipts being respectively 157,583,432?, and 148,302,963f.

As the speech made by Baron Bruck at the dinner given to M. de Lesseps has created what is commonly caUed " a sensation," I send you a translation of it:- " I take the liberty to propose one more toast. It appears to me that aa assembly whioh has met for the purpose of publioly recording the interest which the Austrlans take In the project for cutting a canal aoross the Isthmus of Suez ought not to separate without testifying its deep interest in the lamentable confliot in which England is now engaged In India. All the assertions that have been made respeoting the causes of the conflict are, in my opinion, of no weight when compared with the oruelties whioh the rebellious Sepoys have committed. It mut be taken into consideration that India will fall into a state of total anarchy, and wi for a length of time remain closed against cIvlliza tion, if the authority of England is not specdily restored in her large and beautiful Indian empire. We see most important colonies springing up in Australia; we see France, Russia, and even America coalescing with England in order to open the ports of Tapan, and of oether countries in those remote tegions, and we also see them endeavouring to force China to consent to place her relations with other countries on a more reasonable basis. It does not admit of a doubt that I the completion of the projected Suez Canal would be the most efficaclous way of furthering the great -work of civilization in the East. In the name of oivilizatlon, then, I call on the assembly to drink to the toast, ' Success to the Eng. lish arms in Indisa." As has already been said, the speech and toast of the Minister of Finance were received with loud applause, but no mention has been made of them In any of the Vlenna organs of the press, so indignant are their editors at the slight put upon them by the bankers who gave the dinner. Notwithstanding the public demonstration in favour of M. de Lesseps-which was made at the instigation of Baron Bruck-the Suez Canal fever has greatly abated, and many Austrian financiers, who have promised to contribute largely towards the realization of the plan for uniting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, would bardly lament if they never heard it mentioned again. On the 28th October the Poi-te forwarded to its diplomatic agents abroad a ciroular, in which it repeats what was said in its despatch of September 23, and protests (se pronontee) against any attack that may be made either on its suzerain rights or on the integrity of the Turkish Empire. It ia even said that the Constantinople Government has alluded to -the possibility of. its being oompelled to send troops across the Danube for the maintenance of peace and order in. Wallachia and Moldavia, but there Is no good reason for supposing that it has done so. The political excitement in both the provinces Is very great, but nothing has ocourred to render the intervention of the Porte necessary. According to authentic advices frota Constantiaople, which reached this city yesterday, the Russan and krussian Minsters have followred the example of M,. do Thouveniel, and have had no com- tnunic-ation with Redscbid Paxha since his reappointment. The Sardinian Minister, who is vonued to his roomby ndspodto , o dA g- sent his dragoman to offer his congratulations to Redachid Pasha. About a week since Selim Bey, I a colonel in the Turkish army, arrived here with despatches for Prince Kallixachli but nothing concerning their contents has yet transpired. On the 15th of October the Kosteadji Railroad Company paid 6,0001., as deposit or " caution money," into the hands of M. Musurus, and received from him the firman of concession. The statutes of the company have already been laid before the Council of the Tanzimat. It has been repeatedly stated In the German papers that Count Colloredo has received orders from this Government "to givehisfull supportto the Duke de Grammont, who urges the Papal See to make those reforms in the administration which are deemed necesay by the Weste-rn Powers." The corre- i spondents must have obtained theit information at a troubled source, for it is a positive fact that the Iinperial Cabinet has repeatedly expresed its disinclination to interfere in the internal affairs of other Powers. The Austrian Government may counsel the Roman and Neapolitan Cabinets to mend their manners, but it will not exercise any inoral pressure in order to force them to do so. The telegram aunouncing that an Order in Council has authorized the Bank of England to increase its issues on securities has greatly puzzled the Vienna fainciers. It may beoberved a as the deepatches recelved by some of the great bankers did not exactly tally, the Vienna public doesnot yet know correctly what has taken place. The Count of Flanders, who il busily employed in seeing the lions of Vienna, went yesterday with theEmperor to see the great Arsenal, ad the so-called "Equitation Etablishment." No silitary man should visit Vienn without paying a visit to the last-mentioned institution, which is, in its way, unique. The Austrians have had occason to observe that the issue of a battle sometimes depends greatly on the skill of the drivers of the artilery, and, consequently, the men are, literaly speaking, taught to drive, both in trot and gallop, to an inch. Poreign officers have repeatedly told me that they were astonished at the sklal displayed ini driving 12-pounders at full speed in and out of wattles which were placed abt hort distances from each other In the Riding-schooL As the 19th is the name-day of the reigning Empross, the Emperor has desired the Archduke Albre¢ht, the Governor-General of Hungary, to be present in his stead at the opening of that part of the Theis Railroad wrhich is between &zolnok and Debreczln. Dulring the preliminary examination of Poeza Sandor, it appeared that he had deserted from the regiment to which he belonged many years ago. The renowned bandit positively denies that such was the case, but, in a country inwhich the military organization is so perfect, it wiU not be very difficult to prove that he does not speak the truth. Everything is done to keep from the knowledge of the public what has recently occurred at the Benedictine monasteries; but the very walls seem to have ears, and to take a pleasure in maling known to the world the strange conduct of the Roman Catholic hlerarchy. When M. Slomschek, the Bishop of Gurk and Lavant, was at Seitenstatten, lhe found fault with the Abbot who aceompaniei him through the cloisters and corridors for walking in the middle of them. "'Humility," said the I zaintly gentleman-I had almoet said hypocrte" is the Arst of Christian virtues, and is best shown by modesty. Thus, when you walk you should keep to the wall, so as not to attract attention, instead of taklng the middle of the path." In short, the " linking dodge," in which the Jesuits are such proficients, was strongly recommened to the worthy monk, who had probably passed twothirds of his life in endeavouring to force the rudiments of knowledge into the hard heads of a set of rackety country boyo. At Molk the Bishop of IAnz is said to have received a severe reproof from one of the older monks. The very reverend gentleman began to tell the friar what were his duties as a Christian and a priest, but he was stopped short by the information that he (the friar) ha learned those duties before the bishop was born, and his conscience told him that he had not neglected.them, PRUSSIA. (MOsM oUR oWN GORESPO Dr 1. B2RrtIN, No. 16. On the 29th of October, as I have already reported to you, Austria and Prussia conjointly made a statement to the Federal Diet at Frankfort of the negotiations they had carried on for some time past with the Danish Government with reference to tha two German Duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg. As these negotiations had hltherto remained without result, they now laid the whole correspondence before the Federal Diet, in order that some resolution might be come to with reference to any further step to be taken in the matter. The Hanoverian Governmeiit also caused a motion to be brought in by its representative for a committee to inquire- " Whether the engagements that the Crown of Denmark had entered into with the German Confederation in 1851 nd 1852 had been fulfi=led; and, if it should be found tha; they had not as yet been fulfilled, then for the Foderal Die% to call upon the Danish Crown to fulfil them within a speol fRod time, falling which the Dlet would declare allthe enact ments made by the Danish Government with reference t) the two German Dachies of Holstein and Lauenburg to b, null and invalid.l" These two motions were also preceded by an appeal from the Estates of the Duchy of Lauenburg to the Federal Diet for a declaration that the new charter lately octsoyg to that Duchy by the Danish Govermment was at variance with the recognizel Constitution of Lauenburg, with the Federal law, and the engagements entered into between the Danish Crown and the German Confederation, and for steps to be taken to induce the Danish Government to make other arrangements for the Duchy of Lauenburg in conformity with them. These three matters, as touching one and th3 same subject, were all referred to a committee, which was appointed at the following sitting oE November 5; it consists of seven members, including Austria, Prussia, and the other four king. doms of Germany, Bavaria, Hanover, Saxony, and Wurtemberg, and Bavaria has been selected as the Power whose representative is to bring up the report. In the last sitting of the Federal Diet, on the 12th inst., the subject was not brought forward, nor could it well have been matured in so few days. The amount of matter t) be considered and deliberated on will rather require as many weeks before it can be brought forward. The result of the deliberations of the committee will (when matured) have to be communicated by each of its members to the Government he represents, and its instructions taken as to his further conduct in the matter; it will therefore require not only all the unanimity that at present exists on the subject, but also very great expedition, if the matter is to ba brought before the Federal Diet in pleno any titu this year. Nearly every German State has already caused assurances to be given to the Governments of Austria and Prussia that they perfectly agree with the nature and objects of the motions made, aud that they will support them. A good deal has appeared in the press to the effect that various great Powers have taken steps to prevent this subject being brought before the Asembly most interested in it, one of who3e members (the Kling of Denmark, as Duke of Holsteia and Lauenburg) is the offending party, while the countries aggrieved form also patt of th1e Fedeal territory. it is however not true that either Francs alone, or that the three great Powers conjointly, have made any representations to Austria and Prusmia to restrain them from taldug this, the proper coure, ot a reference to the Diet ; nor have they since that course was taken made any offer to the President of the Federal Diet to use their bons offices in Copen- hagen to ,rocure the settlement of the difficulty; it' io essentially une qerelle A llemande, and the rast of Europe can only approve the Federal Powers keeping their quarrel to themselves. In ohie respect, however, our Government has taken a step that cannot fail to have a beneficial effect on the *settlement of the matter. It has sent a trusty agent int9 Holstein to examine into the truth of the allegatlons brought forward by Holstein agaInst the Crown of Denmark. The German papers mention oir Consul-General in Leipsic, Mr. Ward, as having been intrusted with this mission; if it be so, as I have no reason to doubt is the case, a mnore fit inquirer could hardly have been chosen, Mr. Ward being known as a straightforward Englishman without any prejudices against the Danes, while at the same time he Is a Government emjiloe of long standing and experience in continental politic, and Is not likely to adopt popular opinions hastily one way or the other. The report sent i to the Go- vernment by its confidential agent has been made the subject of ^ circular despatch to numerous diplomatic reresentatives ofGreat Britain abroad, and. poroni of it were lately read In Oopenhagen to a party oE mmbers of tho D)anis Diet.
THE BANK CORTS. PUBLIC MEETING IN GLASGOW. On TtLesday, at noon. a meeting of the noblemen, landowners, merchants, and manufacturer connected with the west of Sootland was held in the Merhants.haU, Glasgow to consider the present financial czisis, to express their con. fidence In the Scotch banks, and to determine how the existing difficulties may be best met and publio confidence re.- stored. The hall was crowded, and hundreds could not ob. tain admissdon. On the platform wereobserved his Gracoe the Duke of Hamilton and Braudon, his Grace the Dake of Montrose, the Hon. the Lord Provost, Lord Belhaven, Shreiff Sir Arohibald Alison, Sir John Maxwell, of Polloo; Sir E. Colebrooke, lLP., Sir IL Stewart, M.P, Sir James Ferguson, Sir James Campbell, Mr. Walter Buohanan, MLP., Mr. P. Blaokbhrn, M.P., Mr. A. B. Cochrane, of Lamiuton; Mr. Robert Stewrt, of Murdoetona; Mr. Robert Finby, of Easter-bill; Mr. William. Muray, of Monkland, & Letters of apology for unavoldablo absenoe and bxpresslng concurrence in the object of the meeting were received frota the Earl of Glagow, Sir James Coiquloun, of Lume; Mr. Smollett, M.P., Mr. Brown, of Lanfine; Mr. Burnet, of Gadgirth; Mr. Hoaler, of NeIwlands; Ifr. Coll Camp. bell, of Colgrain; Mr. Campbell, of Craigle; Mr. Crufard, of Craufhrdland; Mr. Catheart, of Auchindrane; Mr. P. B. ldure Macredie, of Perceton; mr. J. F. Hamilton, of Cairnhill; and Mr. Buchanan, of Drumpeller. The IoRD PtovosT rose and mid,-My Lords and Gentlemen, I propose that his Grcee the Duke of Hamnilton, the Load-IAeutenant of tha county, take the chair upon this occhlon. (Loud chears.) I regret very much that other business will prevent my belng present duing the meetting; but I have no doubt you WillU hear such statements made to yots wvaill prove interesting to you al and very important to the country generally. (Cheers.) The Duke of HA?1 TON, who took the chxir amid grt applause, iaid,-My Lords and Gentlemen, I am delighted to fnd myself in the podtion I now occupy, though I had no expectation of it when I entered this room, I naturany thought that in this great city the Lord Provost ought to occupy this chair, and I feel as if I were usurping his prero. gative. It wouldbe presumption on my part, important as this mesting X, to detain yon with remarks upon a smbject with which you are better acquainted than myself I think it better, therefore, at onoe to introduce to you the noble duke who into move the first resolution. The Duke of MoNTRosn sald,-I have been requested by thoe-ewho have had the arrAngements for the business of thi,meeting to. propose to you a resolution; and I think it will be better that I should, In the first place, read the reso. lution to you, as, though it is not my intention to detain you but for a few minutes, stillI think when you aw aware what the resolution is you. will better understand auy remarks I may make to you. The resolation is as follows:- 11 That thix meeXt a h ull couidence In the sustem of banking Which has beeD lmaintalbed In Scotland for a long perod of yes during wloh the oountry ha made mot raplid advanoes in proeperit; -a Sonfidence onfirmed by the eventa of the las en days-events which prove beyond al doubt the geneal stabity of the bank athogh two, and twovly, hawe yielded to the preag.e, *a 1.resu ag&rayated by a want of that confidenco which is necesc tfor carylug on e odlnary dalings o trade.'" I confesaI have some heaitaeion and diffidence in putting my4elf forward to move such a resolution. I think It is moz the part of those -who are engaged in the great business of this large dty, and busness connected with it, to speak out thelr mind on this matter. At the same time the monetary affairs of this town are so important to all those living anywhere in the neighbourhood of Glasgowr, or connected with the west of Scotland, that I think it is desirable that those wbo cannot be supposed to be connected with the banks themselves, or immedlately and directly interested at the moment in their stability, should feel that it is important for the whole country at large that there should be no panio such as there has been, no unnecessary apprehension, and thatthose who have a stake in the country should express to others who are perha X no' so well informed, and not of so much influence in the community, their undoubting confidence In the stabltv of the banks of Scotland. (Oheers.) And I think that all those who are connected with business, and who have consequently transacted business with the banks, and know the mode in which that is carrled on, must be sensible of the great advantages derived by this country from the system of credit and banking in existence among us. (Cheers.) It is impossible in all ases to say that eredit should be given; that depends upon the judgment and discretion of those who give it, and it is perfectly wr9ng and contrary to reason, if there should be n some cases undue credit, or some mistakes in the business going on, at once to make a run and attack the whole system. (Hear, hear.) There must be discrimination in the conducting of the business, and also in the arguments used for or against It. (Cheers.) I therefore think that you wil alU of you agree in the first part of the resolution, which says that great advantages have been derived by this part of the country from the system of banking which exists. (Applause.) Aud I think you will almost go beyond that, and say that, but for the banking system, the business of this great town acd the manufacturing and trading interests ofthg community could not have been carriedontotheextent to which they have been carried on, and to which we must all wish them to be carried on. (Cheers) I therefore think that at a moment when dstrust has been reted from various circumstances in the banks themselves, and when also a very large number of persons, at least in England, hold that the system of banking In Scotland is not sound, and that the system of Scotch banknotes is not a proper one, and would wish to make great changes in that sirculation and system of banklng-in these eircumstances I think it is right that we should eome forward and state that on the whole we are perfectly satlsfied wit) it, and believe that great dangers and evils would accrue to the country if any great change were to take place. (Cheers.) The latter part of the resolution speaks of our confidence as having been confirmed by the events of the last 10 days. We must all lament that a panio without cause or reason should have arisen, and should have brought about suspension of payment in the case of two banks. But it is quite clear to all who are aware of the resources of these banks, the great wealth of the shareholders, especially a certain portion of them, and the exces. sively sn aamount of their notes compared with the liabilities and securities which they hold-it must be clear to al that the idea that these banks should not be able to fulfil all toir engagements, if reasonable time be allowed, is quite unfounded. (Cheers.) It is quite impossible that any hank whatever can at a moment's notice pay all its liabilitles; it is not in the powver of the Bank of England Itself to do so (cheers); though they maybe supposed to be able to pay the amount of their bank notes by means of Govern. ment securities and bullion, they are themselvesperfectly In the power of their creditors an those who have deposlts under certain circumstances, if they choose to demand payment when the Bank cannot give It. (Hear, hear.) And you may d-pend upon this, that, though the circumstances which have occusred in Scotland, and among the mercantUe community generally, have had a great deal to do with the sus. pencion of the Bank Charter Act, the state in which the Bank of England itself was placed had not a little to do with it. (Eear, hear.) I have been led into these remarks as arising from the mere words of the resolution, but It is not my business to enter further into it. But I must repeat v,hat is aluded to at the end of the resoluton,-hoV inmportant it is that lost confidence should be as much as pos sible restored, and that there should be a more complete and general confidence on the part of the community, that it Is for their benefit that this confidence should exist, and that unless it does very much greater evils must accrue. (Hear, hear.) The noble duke concluded by again reading and proposing the adoption of the resolution, and sat down amtd great applause. Sir JASIMS FxsRGUSSON said,-My lord duke and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I come forward, in accordance with the request made to me, to second the resolution moved by the noble duke w ho has just sat down It is right on an occasion like this, when the business is divided into many resolutions, that each speaker should strictly confine himself to the subject-matter of the resolution hne supports; and, as this resolution has already been so well supported by the noble duke, It is unnneessr that I should say mu^ch in the way of supplementing his remarks. Bat, considering that the latter part of this resolution eAxpresses: as I think, the chief object of our meeting here to-day, I cannot content mys^elf with simply seconding the resolution withou^t making a few remarks upon it. (Cheers.) It seemus to me that w;e are met here to-dy to endeavour to support and repair that great institution, I may eall it, the temporary damage to which has caused the present distress of the country-I refer to the credit of the country-that without which commerce would fail, and without which this country never could have risen to the position wrhioh it now occapals. The credit of the banking Institution of this country has been tem porari s d amaed, and we are met o express our confidence that the,credit of the country, whioh is tWm- porarily impaired, will emerge from tho iresent crlsis as strong as ever. (Cheers.) L segitivO provisions, I am per. suaded, can do nothing to prevent such a panio as now prevails. (Cheers.) It is the credit of the country alone that we must depend upon for safety in such a time of danger; and It is to the publho we mus' look to sapport that credit; and I think that if a meeting such as this ex- presses strongly and unanimously its confidence In the joint-. stock banks of Scotland, their confidence that these banks are fully able to meet their engagements, and their confi. dence in our Dionetary system, as that in which a true monetary policy is to be found, we shall do much tore-assure the public mind and prevent future failures. (Cheers.) And I think the greatest proof of the stabilty of our. banking system Is that in a crisis so unexampled in its soverity but two banks in the whole of Scotland have stopped payment. And we may have the greatest confidenco that this stoppage is of a temporary nature from the fact to which we may point with pride, that the shareholders of both companies have come forward, and In the most manly way placed their means at the disposal of the banks, so that depositors might not suffer loss. (A plause.) When we hear in one short week of nearly l,0,000O. being sub scribed by shareholders of the Western Bank, and good hopes of still more being added to that sum, we may well praise the publio spirit of those men who have thus come forward so nobly to save the credit of the esta - blishment. I will say no more upon the first part of the resolution, which has been already so well poklen to. I have referred chiefly to the latter part of the resolution. feelng, assured that if business and moneyed men, such as r now see before me, come forward to support the great' credit of our country, they rill not only do the country. s great tervice, but wil do much to bind still moreo irmly together the various clases into which the country is divided. (MIuch applause.) Mr. BAIrn CT ocnn said,-I have been requested to sar.a fewf werds in support of the resolution. moved by the noble duke and so ably seconded. It would be quite Irrele. vant for me to enter into any discussion on the fiuancial questions which arise out of the *ircumsatnoes which have called us together. I oome to this assembly rather to learn upon a subject like that than to give utteranc, to any crude opinions of my owvn; but one thought must suggest itself to every one, a thoug,ht whEich he who runs may read, and hEich he who reads should reflect upon-I mean the sympathy happily proved to exist between all classes in this great common ty-thoseconnected with acrieultur,e,comnmeroe,and manufactures. There was a time en it wes supposed that these intereats were antagonistic to each other, but we prove to-day, as we have proved before, but more especaallyto-day, that thesegreat interestsare all united, that they symoathize with each other, and that in the momeut when difficulty and pressure may fall upon one the others come forward to support that great interest by every means. (Cheers.) There Ms another, and one single subject, which I shall just touch upOn, and no longer trespass on your indulgence-viz., that the result of a meeting like this also triumphantly confirms that feeling every true Briton must possess, that in the moment of great trial the country is sufficient for itself. -(Cheers.) Events which are occurring in the half-cIvilized -cities of the far East, in the great centre of civilization here in the West, all prove that the people of this country, with whatever difficulties Providence way be pleasd to aflict them, wiU rise triumphantly out of these and aLU difficulties and wiU combine to support and cheer and console each other in the moment of triaL (Chees.) The Noble CUHAmAYN-I suppose, from the manner in which you have received this resolution and the remarks made In its support, I may conclude that it meets with your approval. (Loud cheers.) Lord BeLsn,ys.-In rising to propose to you the seoond resolution I will in the first place read the resolution, and afterwards say a very few words on the subject. The resolution is this:- * Thst this mestiog deeply regsbt the embarrasment of tade wad pubUc loes whioa would arie from the final stoppage of the two banks wbsch have been obliged to suspend rpayment; and, beUeving them to have ample resources ultimately tomet in full every clim upoh thema, resols to assit their proprietorsand creditors In gpinng time for srangaent o their affAir by joining In the resolution so well taken by 3O fdms in Glagow, and, ie them, Individuslly pledge themselves to accept payment of rent and clams In the anotes of the Westem and Citybanks." I have no doubt that this resolution, like the former, wil be unanimously approved. (Applause.) I would beg leave to state one reason for this, which I think must Influence every person who employs the labouring man. We must ;recollect that those who earn their livelihood by the sweat of their brow are most deeply intereted in this very resolu,tion. (Hear.) How rmany of those individuals may hold in their possession notes of either of these banus, and, if they were refused by any persons in the community, might be I placed, I wiU not say in starvation, but in very great diffi- culty of obtaining the common necessaries of life. (Hear.) If there were no other ground but that I would say that it is sufficient to veigh with every considerate man in inducing him to suppot tthisresolution. (Cheers) The latterpart of the resolution calls upon you to support the proprietors and creditors of the bank, ana pledges us to accept payments in the notes of the Western and City of Glasgow banks, as 300 firms in thbis city have already areed to do. I may Btate to the meeting at the same time what comes within my own knowledge; that I have seen no gentleman, no individus3 in my opwn neighbourhood, or within the county, wvho have not unanimously come forward and desired that the notes of the two banks referred to should be taken in payment of rents and everything. And I have reat pleasure in stating to this meeting that my noble friend the noble duke who now oocupies the chair, at the moment he heard of the stoppage of the Western Bank, sent word to all his agen's desiring that his rents a this time might be taken either in notes or depodit receipts of these banks. (Loud cheers) I thought it would gratify the meeting to know that circnmstance, and I may add that this Is the universal feeling of all our neighbours in the county. Haong saidthis I shal not detain you further, but sit dowb by aim ply moving the adoption of the resolution I hame read. (Loud cheers1 Sir M. S. STEWART.-i have been requested to second this resolution. I must say that I feel somewhat embarrassed on this occasion, because I did not expect to be called upon to come forward in any way at this meeting. Along vith other gentlemen I signed the requisition calling this meeting together, thinldng that we should most likely upon this occasion obtain the advice and hear the oDinion of gentlemen much better qualified to be judges of commercial and mnonetary affairs than myself and others who are here to-day. But when I was asked, two minutes before the meeting was opened, to second this resolution, I felt, of course, that it was wrong for any one to hang back when called upon to take any part in such an imEortant business. (Cheers.) I am not going to detain you, butI will simply say this, that in seconding the resolution moved by Lord Belhaven I gree in every word of it; and, so far as I am personaUy concerned, I may say that I have already acted upon the spirit of the resolution. (Cheers.) I have already received rents paid in notes of the Western and City of Glasgow banks, and, of course, I shall continue to do so. But I do not want to make any boast in saying this, because it does not depend so much upon landlords and others whether they receive the notes as whether the other banks will take them. (Hear.) So long as the banks act in the way they are doing at present, I think there need be -no fear of landlords and others declining to receive Western and City of Glasgow banknotes. I certainly deeply regret the embarrassment of trade; and, as I said, quite agree in the words of the resolution. I did not come here intending or expecting to address the meeting; but if one can say anything to encourage others at such a time I think it Is a duty to do it. (Applause.) And I will only say this-that having unfortunately been a depositor in the Western Bank, and while I oould not but be aware that such a crisis as this might arlse, I thought it would be wrong to withdraw any money I might have from that bank. In a oity such as this one may do a thing and not many know of it; but further west anything of this kind would be better known, and might be misunderstood. And so I thought it my duty not to encourage or foster in any way, any degree of alarmwhich might entail unhappy results. (Cneers.) I thank you for your kindness in listening to what I have said; and I can only further congratulate this meeting and the city on the earnestness, sincerity, and businesslike qualities called forward at this very time. (Cheers.) Mr. WALER] BUCHANAX, H.P., said,-As a citizen of Glasgow, and representing the majority of those here present, I beg to say that it affords me very great pleasure to find on this occasion so many noblemen aud gentlemen of the neighbouring county meetiDg together with us. I think in a question of this kind it is of the utmost importance tiet all classes should unite to express a strong feeling regarding the causes of those evils under which we are at present suffering, and it certainly is peculiarly appropriate that gentlemen connected with the and, and the landed aristocracy of the country, should unite with the mercantile interests in any question regarding banks, because it is most certain that for 50 years back the landed interests, as well as the commercial interests of this country, have been greatly promoted by the institution of oUr Scotch banks. (Applause.) But in a question of the present kind it is necessary there should be a united feeling and a united expression of that feeling, and that we should loudly proolaim our confidence in these establishments. It is not a question among any of us whether any absolute risk of loss has been incurred. We are merely met here to endeavour to stem a headiong panic. If you go abroad into the streets you will be told the Western Bank contains partners among the very richest men in Scotlanad; if you ask regarding the other bank which has stopped you will be told that they are perfectly sound-that their capital is Intact-that they are carrying on a large and profitable business; and yet they arenow placed in the position that they are obliged to shut their doors against the torrents that are rollig in upon them demanding their deposits, Now, there is nothing here to alarm. All that is wanted is that, instead of this excited state of feeling, we should look the evil that has occurred deliberately in the face. Then, I say that the Western Bank, according to the opinion of those who have most particularly investigated its affairs, if it is to continue business, can go on as firnly as before. It has still 1,000,0001. of capital untouchedI,000,COOI. of capital as available for bink purposes as It ever was at any former time-and then, In addition, It has a reserved fund, subscribed byits wealthy and publicspirited proprietary, amounting to somewhere about 500,0001. more. I therefore say that the Western Bank is in as good a position, if only allowed a little time and a little patience on the part of those who have claims upon it, to carry on the business whioh formerly W3S intrustedto it and answer all the purposes of a large banking esblishment, as well as it did at any former period. (Applause.) I am not here to say one word as to the queston of maagement-that is a question which we, the publio, have nothing to do with; that is for the directors, the managers, and the shareholders of that establishmet to settle. It is, no dcubt, a public establishment, and as sach justly amenable to public comment; but the great question for us is-is the Western Bank solvent, or is it not Now, I say we have every reason to feel perfect confidence in the soidity of the Western Bank, and its ability to pay every claim to the last shilling;and I say that it will be for the benefit of the commsunity that that bank -should be reinstated as before, and re- main a large part of the banking system of our country, as it bitherto has done. (Applause.) I would wish to say the -same thing with regard to the City of Glasgow Bank. That establishment it is not contended has made any losses-it remains just as it was; but it has been overborne by a headlong torrent. I do not blame the conduct of the classes who have asked for their money, if they saw a prospect of thelr not being ablo otherwise to meet demands coming upon them, particularly at this season of the yenr-the term time. I do not blame them for coming forward and asking money if they felt alarm. But, on the other hand, we have many instances of the greatest forbearance on the part of the large depositors, and I believe, in regard to both establishments, the larger depositors have shown great forbeartnce, and that it scarcely can be said of any of them that they have gone forwrard to withdraw money in large sums. (Applause.) I think this is highly creditable to these depositors, and would show that they do entertain grelt confidence in these establishments. What I wonld say Is, thatthese two establishmenta have succumbed from mere accident. I do think I am entitled to say that, placed in the same circumstances, exposed to the same panic, there Is zot one fstablishiaent in the oity, there is not one of tbe'chartered banks, there is not one of the joint-stock banks in London, and, as it has been well observed, I believe nob even the Bank of England Itself could have resisted the pressure. Now, are we in a position to give up these banks? 1 Because, by accident or caprlc , circumstances have so faller out that these two establishments have succumbed, are they therefore to be blotted out of ourbankingsystem? Issymost assuredly no. (Applause.) Whether by fresh subscriptions from the propnetary, whether by aid from Government, by vwhatever means it is to be done, it would be a grievous evll were these two establishments not again to be reinstated. I trust I bave not transgressed beyond ths epirit of the resolution. Perhaps, under the feeling of the great evls -which would resalt to this great and Important city, and the loss to the whole community oonneoted with its wvre we to lose these two banking establishments, I may have spoken more warmly than is fitting on the saubject, but recolleot they have more than 200 bmnohes in all parts of the country. I ai uot here to say whether that is a good or a bd policy, but suchIs the fact; and I think It Isn most importnt and nrgent to place them immediately in the same position =hich they oocupied formerly. (Applaue) The resolution was carried by acclamation. Sir EDWARD COLExItOOKc, XP., said,-The resolution I bave oomeforward to proposeis of a more formalcharacter than those preoeding, but it is one of considerable lo. nortaeco as showing the disposition of this meeting not to. let drop the question we have now taken un thut to eome to a resolution which shall be followed up by appointing a committee to consider and cary out the obiects of this meeting. The words of the resolution ate as follows .- R' hat a committee be Ppotbnedto0Achtbeoowse of events, asd teltke such Itce as maT be deemed expedet to crr ot the Tewa o. tbis zeeting, the sid eommittee to osaldAe ot -" Though the subject has been almost exhausted by preceding speakers, I trust Imay be allowed in comnmg forward on the present occasion, to say that I have every desire to add my mite to the exertions of those who are making one determined and unitki effort to stem a tide of alarm which ha threatened to over, whelm the credit and the oommerce of this country. I feel Ican do very little as a countr gentleman towards that object. I o not speak with the local knowledge of my he n. friend who preoeded me, neither with regard to the state of the banks whose stabilityhas been especially called in question nor with respect to the general oommerce of this grt citz and neighbourhood. I feel that those who have pre- done the work of stemming the tide o alarm; that our deepest gratitude Is due to those other banks and to a very large portlcn of the community of Glasgow, who stood forward in the breach, and, with .a knowledge of the circumstances in which they were placed, declred the alarm rwas unfounded, and saXted their willing. ness to take the notes. (Applause.) I say, all honour to those who stood forward in that cause. It Is little perhaps we can do in following their stes, but at the same time - I think we can do sonething. The credit of this ounty stands upon the confidenoe of man in man. It is by standing shoulder to shoulder that we shall stem this torrent- and I think the effect of this meeting will be to show to ihe wbole countryside that there is tbat oonfident dlspo. sition anong us to stand shoulder to shoulder in putting an end to any slight degree of alarm that may still continue to exist. One word only I will add-I feel I am trespassing on you In arguing on a question already so powerfully argued by those gentlemen who hAve preceded me-and that is with regard to the first resolution, plaing confidence in the general banking qstem of Scotland. It is a difficult subject, on which I wll not enter. I wlll only say this .-I think the stability of this system, as of all systems, depends far less on any legislative provlsions than upon the character of the people who cary it out, and 1 believe that the bankling system of Scotland stands on its present foundation chiefly owing to the steadfast honesty and mutual confidence which exist among us, and so long as I Eee this feeling prevail I have no doubt we shall stem this and ayn other alarms that may exist. (Applause.) Sir .AX xLT, of Pollok-I think everything has been said that can be said, and-what is more gratifyingeverything has been done by you whom we are addressing to eupport sad maintain the credit of the banking establish. ments. For my own part, I thinkwo should keep in mind not only ourselves, but those gentlemen who conduct the affidrs of banks, who are frequently led, from motives of kindness and philantropy to try to rescue us in any difficul. ties. I know nothing of the management of the tv;o banks in question; but I know one of the greatest trials a banker caI ave is, what he is frequently called upon to do-to resist th6 savreatie3 of his own friends. I atn sure from the remarks we have heard that all classes of the community have been well and satisfactorily represented by this meeting and by what bas fallen from the hon. gentleman who repreEents us. The resolution was passed un.animously, Sir ARCMBALD ALEON said,-Valuable as time is to us all in a crisis such as this, I feelw e should not separate without in one minute expressing the sentiments of the meeting upon the to submit. This meet ing has beenrciled by the first in rank and the first in station in this great city to express the confidence they feel in the banking institutions of the country, and endeavour, so far as they can, to re-establish that credit and that mutual confidence upon which the walfare and prosperity of all depend. And well and nobly has the appea been met. I see around me on the platform landed proprietors whose united income exceeds 200,0004 a-year. I see before me in the body of the hall merchant princes and others whose income exceeds 2,000,0W&, and these aUl united in expressing a unauimous confidence in the banking institutions of the country, and their determination to do everything in their wer to uphold and maintain those great establishments. (Applsuse.) It must be a proud thing for this country to see that in a crisis such as this what a harmony of feeling there is, and how in this case, where so many persons, and even among the best informed in the country, trembled with fear, the irst in rank and the first in station have come forth in the very outset of the crisis to testify their confidence in the existing establishments. I was happy to hear the announcement made in public. I had already heard in private that the Duke of Hamilton, on the morning when the crisis was first heard of, expressed his determinatlon to take all the notes of the endangered banks in full; and look back with pride and satisfaction to our Own Lord Provost, who has been obliged not to take the chair to-day, when I recollect he was the first, by a public declaration by the Lord Provost and magistrates, to do so much to allay the panic and mitigate its intensity. Without saying more, I feel it is due to this nobleman and to that high functionary publioly to express the thanks of the country for their patriotic conduct on this occasion. Both they and the other gentlemen who have come forward have acted in a way worthy of their country, and which, they may be assured, vill not soon pass from recollection. I beg to propose the cordial thanks of the meeting to the DuL-e of Hareiton for his conduct on this occasion. (Great applause.) The Duke of HAIILTON.-Gentlemen, I thank you sincerely for the kind manner in which you have received ry name. My name has been alluded to twice, and I have merely to state that it is perfectly true that the moment I heard of the suspensilon I acted as my conscience dictated. I am happy to feel myself in this position, though it ought not to be my positionin Glasgow. Still, from my old famly connexions with Glasgow, I shall always be proud to meet gentlemen who have been so long connected, and on such friendly terms, with the name I bear. I thank you, gentlemen, sincerely for the honour you have done me. (Great applause.) The proceedings then terminated.

THE MUIRDER IN HERTFORDSHIRE. STEVENAGE, Nov. 18. This morninag Jeremiah Carpenter, wo,o staiids olaarged 1on the coroner's inquest with the murder of John Starkins, of the Hertfordshire Coumty police, was b ought befora3 the bench of magistrates at Stevenaage. The magis rates present ,were the 11ev. M r. Prodgers, the I1e v. ahr. IHarding, the R1ev. Mr. Knapp, and Mr. Morris Pry or. Mr. J. W. Tlftjoln, solicitor, appeared to watch the case on the part of the prisosser. On the prisoner besing brought in Captain Rober-tson, chief conistable of Hertfordshire, stated that, althouigh he -was himself quite prepared to conduct the examiniation of the prisoner to a close, he thought that at the present stage It would be more repectful to the bench anid more batisfaotory to the counity if he placed the matter in the hands of a professional gentleman, and he had therefore directed Mr. Hawkins, of the Home Circuit, w-ho had a perfect knowledge of the locality of the mnurder, to be retained on the past of the police. Mr. Hawkins sad thaat he thought it would be better if he were to state to the magistrates all that as yet had come out with reseoet to this most brutal murder. The learned counsel then proceeded to give the following narrative of the circumstances that have come to light hin this intricate case -.-The deceased, he observed, lived inL the town of Stevenage, and, having received inistructionis from Inspector H-awkes which would carry him to the neighbour. hoodL in which the crime was committed, he left the station at 5 o'clock, and was seen onL the railway bridge about 25 mainutes after by a flydriver, who had been examined. He had been seeni also by two persons Yamcd Poltrel and Rowe standing on a gate which led from the railway bridge in the diretilon of Cooper's Braches lie was observed, to move hastily from the spot, and naothing more was seen of him until 11 o'clock on Monday morning following, when his body was discovered by a fellow-constable. The body was in a pond in the field, one foot being out of the water and his hand just covered. On taking the body out of the water it was discovered that the throat was cut from ear to ear. There -was nio douLbt that the mnan had conic by his death by the mnost cruel violen-., and, in point of fact, had been brutally murdered. TXhe body wastaken to the Chequers publiebouse in Stevenage, where the pest mrci-es examination took place. On the discovery of the body a ssarch was very properly made to ascertain the state of the field, and it was discovered that somewhere about 20 yards from where the body was found there was a large mass of blood ; one of the witnesses described it as a patch as large as the top of a bushel, and another said that the ground had the appearance of an aninmal having been slaughtered there. There were marks of a violent struggle having takeni place, and at a short distance in another part of the field -was found a quantity of wheat, with a few kernels of barley of a peculiar charActer. With regard to the psi'taner, he would state the circumstanices which tended to fix him as being the perpetrator of the crime. Ho was at work on Friday, thae day of the mnurder, and also onL the previous day, in a held iwbich formed a portion of the farnm of Mr. Horn, of Norton-green. Hiewas engagedIn sowin)gwheat, and had oasion to go froni the field to Norton-greenx to fetch some wheat, and that wheat was of precisely the sanie description as the wheat found in Cooper's Braches, where this unhappy rAun was murdered. The prisoner was not seen on Friday, but bin usual time of leavinig work was fromi 5 to half-past. The distance from the railway field to the prialner's ottaige on the high road between Stevenage and Si.- ls was a mile and one or two yards, and, moaking a very liberal allowance for that journey, it could not be supposed that lb would occupy him more than 20 or 25 miinutes. If, therefore, he left his field at 5 o'clock, -which he might have done if ho thought fit, he wouldd have arrived home at half-past 5. The first point in the case was what time did he arrive home? Not till past 6 o'clocki; so that there was, at all events, half-ana-hour to be acLcounted for from the time he left the railway field until he reached his own cottage, even suppocing him to Lave walked at the slowest p ace. After his arrest on the Monday ho himself described the rout-e which he took, ttatirg ithat he had gone along a sort of cartway inito the road that led.across Norton-green, and, having crossed that road by two cottages, bad reached his cottage at half-past 5, Now, that statement it could be shown was unatrue an two particulars; first, he was not at homeo until more than halfan-hour after that time, whicoh would have allowed him ample time to commit the crime, having been seen by a lad named Sheppard to comne in at the back-door through the garden at 6 o'cloek ; and it would be proved also that -he did not pass the cottages on his way home, as stated by him. Ile (Mr. Hawkins) believed that before this inquiry terminated they should be able to show the exact route taken by Carpenter. The next point to which he would call their attention was the dress of the rrisoner. His usual dress was an oldl smockfrock and an oId wide-awake, and it would he shown that ho had gone to work in his ordinary dress that mnorning. He had complained of no accident during the day, andi there was nothing to account for a remarkable lameness which was apparent when be got home at 6 o'clock. When observed by the boy he was dressed. in his old smock, and was noticed to he latne. Ile -wenit into his cottage, and, after a period of about 20 minutes, an alarm was givn by Mrs. Carpenter to Sheppard, the father, that her fus and had met with a serious accidenit; that onigoing to get some clomps of wood lying by the side of the road, one of them had fallen on his leg, and he could not extricateit. When they went to him it was perfectly true that he was found lying on the ground, with his face to it, but in a most peculiar position, and, what wvas still mnore suspicious, It was foand that between the time he Was seen coming in and the timne of the alleged accident he had changed his dress, and gave as his reason for doing so that he was going down to Stevenage for some pigs' victuals. The clumps of wood referred to had been inspected, and the witness who had examined them -would tell them that they had never beeni removed at all. The nman was undoubtedly lame before he arrivedl at his cottage, and, of course, if it was trute that he had been engaged in a struggle with the policeman, and had received anl inur either by a, fail or a kick, it wouild become a m-zattr ffir t-rate consequence to frame some tale to account for the injury as speedily as possible. The next morning he went to work still wearing hiis best smock, hut was obliged to return home from lsis lameness, and he remained at home until he was taken into custody on the Monday. OnL being taken into custody he was asked for his knife. That knife was afterwards taken fromn his son by the police, and had been examined, aod a spot of blood found upon it, and it was a strong circurastauce as against the prisoner that not only was his basket discovered to he spotted with blood, but in the interstices of the wicker workr was discovered some red wheat. mixed withL barley of precisely the same descriptioni as that found in. the field. On examining the clothes of the prisoner it was founid that some ofI the buittonis were wrenched off, as well as from the gatr,and the thread that was left was stained with blood. 1withou.st wishing to press the case unduly against the prisoner, he was bound to mentioni that the policemnen in investigating the matter had sifted the surface of the ground at the spot at which the corn was found,and they had found a pearl button, which maight or might not have heen on the prisoner's gaiters. Those that remained were all odd buttons, and onie of the buttons on the trousers was found to be tinged With blood. It was quite evident that from the time between theI mnurder and the apprehension of the prisoner there must have been abundant opporttnity to have got rid of the old smocfok and 1i was not surprsing that all the effortskf% 0the police to find it ha been unsuccessful. The prisoner's cottage had been several times searched, but in vain. At length, after an interval of three or four days had elapsed, and probably when the inmates thoiught that there would be no further searching, Inspector Hawkes discovered in a cupboard two pieces of an old smockfrock stained with blood, and which it imust be presumed, in the absence of any evidence on the subject, belonged to the prisoner. Those facts, be thought, would, when proved, be quite sufficient to justify an immediate committal; but if the Bench thought it would he better to remnand the prisonaer from timue to time, in order thAt the police might obtain additional evidence, he had no objection to such a course, and there would he no Injustice in it, inasmuch as the prisoner was already detained under the coroncers warrant. At the conclusion of the learned counsel's address a great number of witnesses were examined, but very few additional facts came out. A very strong suspicion exists in thle minds of the police that the man Sheppard knows a great deal more about the matter than he chooses to teoll ; be was accordingly confronted with a woman to whom he had miade a statement respecting the prisoner's condition on the night of the mnurder, and subjected to a severe examination by Mr. Hawkins, He said that whein he was called to the prisoer's assistance he was resting on the ground on his hand and one knee, and his right foot was caught between two of the stuhbed-up roots, and when hie moved the root the prisoner fell down on his backc. The root uponi which the leg was resting might have been between thLree and four feet high, He must bave got on the top of the heap of roots for such an accident to have taken place. When his boot was taken off, which might have been about 10 minutes after he was got out of the heap of roots, Sheppard said, "Dear me, Jerry, it's swelled already." He was taken into the house as soon as they coulId get him up. By Mr. Vesey. -Tho skin was not broken, nor did I ace any blood upon his boot. Inspector Evans stated that he hadl examined the place whiere the roots of some trees were said to have fallen down and hurt the prisoner's leg, but, with the exception of two small ones, which had evidently been removed from the further- end, they did not seem to have been disturbed. Police-constable Isgate was recalled, and produced a memorandum book, the key of the handeaffs found in the field, and 7s. 6d. in silver, which he had taken from the pocket of the deceased, David Carpenter, theson of the accused, was examined with reference to what had become of the working smockfrook of the prisoner. He stated that he saw t in the house on the Saturday after the policeman was killed, but did not know whas had since become of it. He did not know whether he saw it upstairs or down. On Sunday it was lying on the table in the front room. Nobody was doing anything to it; it was not folded up, but lying loose on the table. Did not see either his mother or his father touch it. Never saw it again. His father was sitting in the house, and had his new frock on then. Witness went to church in the afternoon, and when he came home the frock had been removed. His father had two smockfrocks, but he could not tell wbat sort of a frock he usually wore; thought it was whiter than the pieces shown him. William Red said that the frock produced in a sound condition was not the frock ordinarily worn by the prisoner at his work, which was much worn, especially at the sleeves and wristhands. He could not speak to the pieces shown him, as the sleeves and wristbands had been torn away- all that he could say was, that the smockfrock generally w-orn by the prisoner at work was a very bad one. William Sheppard denied aU knowledge of the kind of smockfrook worn by the prisoner. He did not notice what he had on when he was called on to render prisoner assist. ance in getting the log of wood off his leg. It was dark then, and dark next morning when he saw the prisoner going to his work. Knew that Mrs. Parker called him in as he was passing on Saturday morning, hut did not recollect making any statement to her. Did not recollect that he knew what sbe wanted him for, that he had seen enough of Carpenter's. Did say that if the boy did not go home and mind his plait he would pay him. Never took the least mortal notice of Carpenter that night. He did not whisper to him to send the boy way. Did not notice his hands or bis face. Did not tell Mrs. Parker that he noticed that Carpenter was all of a tremble, or that his lips moved. He untied his shoes, but did not notice that there was blood on them. Saw that his gaiters were loose, but whether they were unbuttoned or tbat some of the buttons had been lost, he could not say. Never said that he was afratd to go to Mrs. Parker. Could not teU whether he said that he knew his boy saw more than he ought to have scen. Did not believe that he mentioned anything about it. He did say he knew the boy to be a chattering young rascal, and he was afraid that he had told the gentlemen a lot of lies ; did say that he saw enongh at Carpenter's tnat uight-he meant by that that he saw his foot bad. He thought the boy beinm there would bring him into trouble. He never said that he knew the boy saw more than he ought. He sent the boy away because he was always pushing his nose into everything. A great deal more evidence was given by the different witnesses, and the examination of the prisoner lasted from 11 in the morning tUl half-past 5 in the evening, but no new facts were given, and at the conclusion of the evidence the Rev. Mr. Prodgers, the chairman of the bench, asked the prisoner It he had anything to say. Carpenter, who looked paler than on the former occasion, and who had watched the various witnesses while giving their evidence with the closest attention, replied that he should reserve his defence for the trial. Be was then fully comnmitted to take his triaI for the murder of John Starkins at the next Hertfordshire assizes. After tbe committal of the prisoner, he was conveyed to Hertford Gaol in a close carriage. A large crowd of per. sons assembled in front of the schoolhouse to see him enter the vehicle.
ACADEMY OF SCIE s.-At the lst sitting M. Babinet read a paper on the figure of the earth, In which he remarkedontheuncertalntywhichstirextstedonthatsubject He observed that at the MarquesasIslandsthe globe appears to be considerably flattened, and that It would be highly advantageous to science to measure a degree there. In the Isle of Wight, Mr. Colby had found that, notwithstanding its flatness, there was a discrepancy of nearly 1-20th between the real profile and the measured arc. Hence x. Babluet concludes that the globe naust be considered as an ellipsoid, in which the difference between the equatorial and polar radii is less than 1-300th, and that acommlssion ought to be named to study the question more thoroughly thanhas hitherto been done. Mi. Leverrier presented diagrans of Jupiter, as seen on the 1st of October last, and of Saturn with its rings, as observed on the 7th of February last. He also gave an account of a meteor observed by himself on the 29th nIt., about 6 p.m., whilelooking at the moon. Its brilliancy was equal to that of Jupiter, It moved eastwards parallel to the horizon, and disappeared In the course of about six or seven seconds, leaving three reddish points behind, which likewise disappeared shortly after. Marshal Vaillant observed the same phenomenon from the Bastille. M. Leverrier also presented fresh observations of the 50th planet taken at Bilk by the discoverer, It Luther, and ephemerides of the planet caloulated by M. ;Bruhns, of Berlin. I. Guarin-Mnevillo sent in a letter on the Cetonia aurata, or rose-beetle, which for some time past has engrossed the attentioa of naturalists as a remedy for hydrophobia. X . Mdneville stated from personal experience that in the governments of Voroneje and Koursk, in Russia, it Is customary to give dogs halfa beetle in powder from time to time, mixed with broad crumbs, as a preservative against that disease ; and that the Russians affirm that there are persons who cure hydrophobia radically by means of the fresh juice of a certain plant. He further suggested that the want of freshness may be the reason why these juices preserved In chymists' shops do not produce the desired effect. Marshal Vaillant announced that ht. Hardy, director of the Experimental Garden at Algiers, had sent him 127,000 cocoons of the silkworm that lives upon the castor-plant (Riarnus co7munnis), to be experimented on wlth a view to test the quality of their silk. L. de Paravey wrote to remind the Academy that the two satellites be- lging to the planet Japiter had been noticed by him In thfc Japasesc Bncyclfpcedia, and that he had also mentioned four smari globes surrounding a larger one placed over the head of Jupiter Ammon in the Egyptian basreliefs. His letter concluded with establishing an intimate relation between the science of the Egyptians and Japanese. A A discovery of great interest to the artistical world," says the Pt-esse, "w as lately mnade by MI. Edmond Aboat, the writer, while going through the shop of a collector of cariosities In the Rue da Bac. After examining different articles, the master of the place informed his visitor that he had in his possession 12 pictures by Titian: and taking him into an inner room showed them as they hung against the wfall. These pictures are four feet long by nine inches hi"h and represent the history of Joseph, according to Bibli'ca1 tradition. In supPort of his assertion that the pictures were genuine the dealer produced letters from L. Flandrin and IL Delacroix stating that the pictures were very valuable, In a short time AI* About and the dealer came to terms, and the pictures were placed in the hands of a cleaner, who, after a first operation, remarked that in aU the pictures Joseph bore a resemblance to Charles V., which was considered in favour of their autheuticity. The cleaner, in following up his operations, soon afterwards discovered in a corner the signature of Titian thus worded,-' Tizianus v&ercius doa Cadore iarft.'"

ROILS' COIURT. C TCAMRRVT.AJ WT-V 1- IN RE MICHAEL POqTRR (Befoc theMASTR of the RoiLs.)* This was an application by Mr. YMichael Foster, a resident within the parish of Little She!ford, in the county of Cambridge, that a writ of prohibition might issue out of the Court of Chancery prohibiting the Chancellor of the Bishop of Ely and his Lordship's Vicar-General and Official Principal of the Consistorial and Episcopal Court of the diocess of Ely, or other or others the judge or judges of the said Consistorial and Episcopal Court, from further proceeding in the suit which has been instituted in such court by James Edward Law and Arthur Austen, churchwardens of the said parish of Little Shelford, ogalnst the said Michael Foster for subtraction of church-rate, and which is now pending in the said court. The application was arst made m July last, and then stood over in order to enable the churchwardens to answer the case made by Mr. Foster. On that occasion the motion was directed to stand over till the lirst seal-day in hiohelmas Term, both parties undertaking not to object to the motion being mrade and disposed of in term time if the Court should not object thereto. Mr. COTB, for Mr. Foster, now renewed the applica- The MAsTER of the ROLLS suggested that such applications during term ought to be rnade to one of the common law court4 not to the Court of Chancery. Mr. COLT referred to the statute 12th and 13th Vic. toria, cap. 109, sees. 26, 27, and 28, as to the Court now having larisdiction during term time to grant the motion, though, no doubt, such applications were more usually made to a court of law. Mr. RourNDELL PALMER and Mr. BRrSTOWZ, for the churchwardens, referred to the case of "Montgomery V. Blair" (2, Soho. and Lef., 1,36), as an authority to show that when the other courts are open this Court should not entertain an application for a prohibition. The MASTER of the RoLLs was of that opinion, and declined to entertain the motion. An order was thereupon taken, by consent, to the effect that Mr. Foster should with all due diligence apply to one of the courts of common law ,or the writ of prohibition, no proceedings to be taken in the Ecclesiastical Courts in the meantime, the evidence that has been gone into in Chancery to be used at law if allowed by the common law court, and the costs in Chancery to be dealt with as the court of law should direct.
VIOE-CHANCELLORS' COOTRT14 Tvw 1R LOBD V. COLVT=. (Before Vice-Chancedor Sir R. T. KIiODERsLEYA xneJabove is the leading title of eight suits which now come to a hearing, and have reference to the estate of the late Dr. Peter Cocbrane, who died in June, 1831, and whose property, now in qutestion, amounts to no less a sum than 220,0001. The testtor resided, at different periods of his life, in England, Scotland, France, and India, and formed connexions and arassed property in those countries, raislng questions of domicil whrch rwere of extreme importance, having regard to the amount of the property and the situation of the parties interested. The will was at first treated and proved as an English testament, whereas it was subse- uently considered to be Scotch, and that his domicil was Scoteh likewise. Dr. Cochrane left two sons, the first of a marrlage in Indla with a1 European, and who by the terms of the wvil were to be absolutely entitled at the age of 25; but, as they both died under that age, other marties were let in, who were children (if there should be such) of a lady named Moorhouse, a daughter of the testator, by a native Indian lady known as Beebee Cochrane, to whom he was alleged to have been married according to the Mahomedan form-first at Feruokabad, and then at C*wn. pore. The next of kin of the testator likevrise put in a claim, and an immense mass of evidence had beei brought together with reference to almost every action of Dr. Coch. rane's life, and obtained in a great measure upon commis. sions granted to Scotland and France. One to India was applie for and strongly urged, but eventually refused. Under these circumstances, anl these causes came on together, and the aguments commenced Yesterday, were resumed to-day, and are still proceeding.

TINLXR V. THE BOARD OF WORKS FOB TIE WANDS- WORTH DISZBICT. This was a motion for an injunction to restrain the de. fendants, the Board of Works for the Wandsworth district, from pulling down or converting the privies attached to 39 cottages belonging to the plaintiff, situate at Ford'sbuildings, in the parsh of St. Mary, Battersea, or any of them, into waterclosets. The question raised in the care waa whether the defendants had the power of converting, contrary to the wish of the plaintiff and of his tenants, hut at the expense of the plalntiff, the before-mentioned privies Into waterelosets. The contention on the defendants behalf was that such conversion was necessary for the public health. The question in the case turns on the Nuisauces Remioval Act (1855) and the Metropolis Local Management Act (1855 . The motion occupied the Court up to 2 o'clock. when public duty called the Vice-Chancellor elsewhere, and was not then concluded. It wili be resumed to-morrow (Thursday). Mr. Bacon and Mr. Schomberg appeared for the plaintiff and Mr. Mains and Mr. W. D. Lewis for the defendants.
COURT OF QUEENI S BENCrr. W 'rVi 1 i Q THE O1J}. V. 'IwTT. ATV- - 11 I - A I A ._ (Pitings in Baenco, before Lord CAMFBELL anld Just ics COLRmIDGZ and WTP"fAvF I In this case a rule had been granted to show cause why an order made by the Metropolitan Board of Works should not be quashed, on the ground that It was made without juris. diction. It appeared that C. T. Depree had for some time acted as clerk of the works to the Paving Commissioners of the Eastern District of Southwark, appointed under a local Act; but, in June, 1855, the commissioners gave him a three montns' notice and paid him his salary, both of which he accepted, and gave a receipt In full for all claims on the commissioners. The bletropolis Manage. ment Act (18th and 19th Victoria, c. 120) passed soon after, and Mr. Depree being made acquainted with the 214th section, which entitled all officers of local boards on the Ist of J anuary, 1856, to compensation for the loss of their offices' he made a claim to the Southwark District Board. This claim was disallowed, upon the ground that on the 1st of January, 1856, he had ceased to be an " officer" within the meaning of the Act. He then appealed to the Metropolitan Board of Works, -who allowed the appeal, and awarded him compensation. The present rule was then obtained, upon the ground that the Board had no jurisdiction. Sir F. TiiESICER and Mr. BODRLN now showed canse against the rule, and contended that the Board had jurkdiction to hear the appeal, and the crtiorari was taken away by the 230th section. Mr. Lussi, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Tayler), said the Board had given themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding a facb necessary to give themselves jurisdictionthe order was therefore bad, and was properly brought up. Lord CAITPBELL said he was of opinion that the certiorar' should be quashed. The cartiorari was taken away by the 230th section, and if the Board was acting within its juris. diction the certiorari ought not to issue. That was in ac. cordance with the dcicsion in " The Queen v. Bolton" (1Q. B.). Here there was an appeal to the Board ef orks which they were bound to hear; and it was not the case of deciding a preliminary fact, to give themselves jurisdiction. That was given on appeal. The annuity depended on whether or not the avpellant was an officer on the 1st of January, 1856. The Board had clearly jurisdiction to inquire into that, and if they were of opinion that, thouph on the 30th of June he had ceased to be in the employ of the commissioners he continued to be an officer on the 1st of January, 1856, he was entitled to compensation. Whether or sot the Board had come to a right conclusion the Court had no right to inquire. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE and Mr. Justice WrOur2eAN were of the same opinion. Certiorarsi quashed. Sir F. TifEsIGIR applied that the certiorar! should be quashed, with costs. Lord C&svBEaL. -You are very lucky to get coinpensation. (Laughter.) Sir F. TESIGER said he appeared for the Metropolitan Board. Certiorari quashed, without costs. THE QUEEN (OS TIHE PROSECUTION OF T1E VESTRY31EN OF ST. MARYLEDONE) 1. TIIE ROYAL MEDICAL AND CHIRUROICAL SOCIETY OF LONDUN. This was a case stated for the opinion of the Court, ralsing the question whether the Royal Medical and Chirurgica Society of London was liable to be assessed to the poor-rate in respect of the society's house, situate at No. 53, Berners.street, Oxford-street. It appeared that the sooiety was instituted by Royal charter of the 30th of September, 1835, for "the cultivation and promotion of physic and surgery and of the branches of science connected with them." By the bylaws the society was to consist of Fellows and honorary Fellows. The Fellows were to pay an admission fee and a subscription of three guineas per annum. The transactions of the society, under the title of " Medico. Chirargical Transactions," were printed under the direction of the council, and in the year 185- the proceeds of such sale amounted to 581. Ils. 5d. There was a library, and each Fellow was allowed to be in posses. sion of eight books at the same time. Pamphlets and periodical publications were not to be kept above one week, nor any other book beyond two weeks. Ordinary general meetings were to be held twice in the montb, and the business of the society at such meetings was " to read letters, reports, and other papers on medicine, surgery, or any of the branches of science coinnected therewith, and to converse tpon professional subjects." In order that the society might conform with the provisions of the 6th and 7th Victoria, cap. 36, it was provided that the funds of the society should at all times be devoted to the purposes for which it was instituted, and no dividend, gift, division, or bonus in money sholuld at any time be made unto or between any of its members. In was found In the case that the society occupied the whole of the house in question, with tho exception of two rooms and a cellars and stables. The two rooms and cellar, with right of a6&css through the streetdoor and staircase, were let off to the Society for the Rehef of the Widows and Orphans of Medical Men in London and its Vicinity at the annual rent of 521. lOs., and on the occasion of such letting it was agreed between the two societies that the Widows and Orphans Societ,v might place a brass plate on the outer door * that they snould be supplied with gas in the rooms so iet to them- and that they might use for general meetings, if require, the first roonm on the first laoor, which was otherwise occupied by the Medico-Chirargial. Society. The society had been rated at a rateable value of 1561. for the whole building, the rooms being let to the Widows and Orphans Society for 521. l0s. and the stables to other parties for 301. per annum. Exemptiorn from rateability was claimed, upon the ground that t e society was established exclusively for the purposes of science, literature, or the fine arts, and so came within the 6th and,7th of Victoria, cap. 36. It was agreed that if thb exemption existed as to the whole house, except the stables and rooms let, the rate should be reduced to 751.; but if it existed, except as to the stables and rooms let, and also except as to the first room on the first floor, the rate should be redced to 751. Mr. HtUDDLESTON, Q.C. (with whom was 3fr. Taylor), was heard for the respondents; and Mr. C. POnnocK for the society. Lord CAsMPELL said he was of opinion that the society came Within the Act of Parliament, being established exclu sively forpurpose5 of science, literature, orthe finearts. It was establihed exolusively for purposes of " ecince," or, in the words of the oharter, "for the cultivation and promotion of physic and surgery, and of the branches of science connected with them" Pahysic and suzrgery must be considered as Eciences. It was said that by the by-laws the members at their ordinary general meetings met, among other things, "to converse on professional subjects " but the Court would assume that the conversation of the members would be on professonal subjects and advance of the science to which they were devoted. It appeared that a part of the house was let off as a separate tenement. That might be rated separately; and where tihrt was the Case it would slot take away the exemption of the society. But wish regard to the room used for the general meetings of the Widows and Orphans Society, his Lordship thought the objection was fataL It must be taken as part of the agreement of letting, that it was agreed that the Widows and Orphans Soleetq taight place a brass plate on the outer door, t at they should be supplied with gas in the rooms to let to them, and that they nJght use for general meetngs, if required, the first room on the first-floor,which was other. wise occupied by the Medico-Chirurgical Society. The latter society could not be considered as in the exclusive occupation of that room; and therefore in accordance with the case of "Purvis v. Trail" (3 Ex., 344), he felt bound to ive Judgment aganst them. The society was a very audable one, and as the defect could be easily cured, it would be able to enjoy the exemption. Mr. Justice CoLmRIDGE and Mr. Justice WrGsTmAe expressed themselves to the same effect, and thought that physic and surgery ought to be ranked among the " applied sciences." hfr. HUDDLESTON asked that the rate should be confirmed, and with costs; but, after some discussion as to how the decision of the Court should be applied to the questions submitted to it, Lord CAnPBELL said the rate must be reduced to 751. According to the practice of the Court, this would be without costs. THE QUEEN V. ZSDA= AND OTI}S.S, THE QUEEN V. BROWN AND OTHERS. THE QUEE V. STAPYLTON AND OTHERS. Mfr. DIGBY SSYMOUR moved for a rule to show cause why the Attorney-General should not furnish to the de. fendant H. T. Cameron particnlars of the charges intended to be supported under certain counts of the above informations. Lord CAmrPBEL said the Court had already grauted rules in the case of other defendants, and the learned counsel might take a rule. THE QUEE V. THE SAME PARTiES. Mr. LA-WRANCz made a similar application on the purt of the defendant H. D. Macleod. Lord CAmPB= sadc the learned counsel might take a rule, and that both the rules must be drawn up peremptorily for to-morrow. (Sittings in London.) This was the second sittigin term In Lonrim.

COURT OF COM2MON PLT.A WA .,, . n0 Sitfnge inBanco, at We41minjter, _Miudmas Term) To-day was special paper day, and the Court was occupied with hearing arguments ona special case-" Poppleton v. Buchanan"-as to the construction of certain conditions of sale of some freehold and copyhold prop . The COxRT took time to consider its judgment. (Sittins l atNii Prst, at GuildhaU, beJore Mr. Justice CRESSWXLL and a Common Jury.) LYNCH V. LIVEirORRn. Mr. Keane appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeaut Ballantine for the defendant. This was an action brought bythe plaintiff, a boy 12 yeara old (suing by his next friend), to recover damages for in. juries sustained from the bite of a dog belonging to the defendant. According to the evidence adduced in support of the plaintiff's case he was playing in a yard near Snow-hill with a do; belonging to the defendant, when the animal f'ew at him and bit him in the thigh so severely that he was confined to his bed for some time afterwards, was under the care of a surgeon for five weeks, and two maonths elapsed before the wounds inflicted were entirely healed. It was also shown that another boy, who gave his testimony fn a loose and half-witted manner, had been bitten by the same dog, and that the defendant, on being informed of this circumstance, had said that he would have it chained. A monthly nurso deposed that the same dog had run after her and bitten her clothes, but not so as to tear them. The defendant said that he had met with the dog in a half-starved state, and had given It shelter in his stable, that the children in the court were in the habit of Playing with and teasing it, that the plaintiff had been strl int i with a stick on the occasion when he was bitten, and had been warned against provoking it, not only then but at other times, and that ho was not aware that the dog was savage or accustomed to bite people. The evidence of the defendant was materallDy strengthened by that of other witnesses, and especalUy by that of a boy named Thomas, who had viewed the incident from a neighbouring window, and who swore distinctly that the boy struck the dog three times before he Mr. Justice OnxsswEr.r pointed out to the jury that they must, before they could find a verdict for the plaintiff, be satisfied that the dog was a savage one and accustomed to bite people, and that the defendant knew this, and, having carefully summed up, a verdict was returned for the defendant. In the course of the trial of this cause the learned judge made some much caled for observations upon the difficulty wbich counsel experienced in makirg witnesses speak audibly, and remarked that when a man answered questions in a low tone of voice the natural, though perhaps not the correct inference in all cases was that he was not teluing the truth, EARY V. WOIBIVELL. Mr. Keane was for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant BaDantine for the defendant. The plaintiff, a cab-driver, sought to recover damages for an assault said to have been committed upon him by the defendant, a cab owner, underthe following circumstances: -One day in September last the plaintiff brought home and paid to the defendant 3s. only as the earnings of his cab and horse, and saying that he had had a very bad day, and had only taken 5s., proposed to make up the sum to 6s., the usual amount, at some other time. Without uttering a word, the defendant seized him by the collar, threw him down, knelt on his chest, broke one of his ribs, and o*erwise illused him about the head, until, as one of the witnesses said, " his face was red and all manner of oolours." There was no doubt that a scuffle bad taken place, and that the plaintiff had suffered considerably on the occasion; but the defendant's version of the transaction differed widely from that given by the plaintiff, and the defence was that the cabman had come homie drunk, and had been very violent and abusive, using language of the most grossly disgusting nature in the presence of Mrs. Wombwvell and her family; that the defendant had told him to leave his premises, and on his refusal to do so had compelled him to go by main foxce, " as he lawfully might do." The jury found a verdict for the defendant.
I COURT OF EXCHEQUER, WEDESDAV. NAy. 1R (Sittivgs in Banco.) The COURT took the special paper to-day, and disposed of a few cases, the points in which were not of a character to interest the general reader. At the sitting of the Court judgment was given in the foUoowing among other cases - LEE V. COOKE. The CnrTF BARON stated that in this case, in which Mr. Macaulay had moved to enter a verdict for the plaintiff, or for judgment non obstante reredicto, there would be no rule. The action 'Was brought against the defendant for seizing a bean stack of the plaintiff as a distress for rates, and it appeared at the trial before Mr. Jutice CresswelL, at Lincoln Assizes, that the defendant had before seized the same stack for the same distress, when it was snld, bnt that the plaintiffhad resisted its removal from his premises, upon which the defendant made the second seiznre. At the trial and on the motlon it was contended that as there had been an actual sale of the stack, the property had passed to the buyer, and the defendant could not levy on it a second time. The learned judge left it to the jury to say whether the buyer had the means of obtaining possession, and vhether the plaintiff was the party who prevented his so doing, and the jury so answered these questions as that a verdict was entered for the defendant. It was now intimated that there could be no rule granted, as in the opinion of the Court it was not competent to the plaintiff, under the circumstances of the case, to set up the sale as a bar to the collector's right to levy for the rates by a second process of distress, the plaintiff having himself rendered finitless the proceedings under the first. Rule refused. ARMIYELD V. ALLPORT. This was an action on a bill of exchange, the declaration alleging the date to be the 2d of January, 1856, while the bill itself was actually, though no doubt by mistake, dated 1857. At the trial at Warwick Mr. Macaulay objected that the variance was fatal; but the learned judge (Cresswell) directed a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to a motion wbich was made early in the present term, vwhei the Court took timne to consider. The CHins BAR~ON now stated that the judges were of opinion that the rule ought to be ref used. Judgnnent accordingly. (Sif is at .Z',~ PrWus, at~ Quildlz , before Mfr. Baron MARn and Commron Juries,.) ONKEW V. COLLTT. This was an action brought to recover a sum of 17&M for goods supplied. The defendant pleaded never indebted, arld that the plaintiff had consented to take a bill of eschanigo fronm a person named BDIl, in satisfaction of his claim. Ifr.iidwi,n James and Mir. Gorden Allen appeared for the plaintif and Mr. Knowles represented the defendant. It appeared that the plaintiff was a coachbuilder at Fins- bury, and the defendant was a merchant In Bombay. In, the beginning of last summer the defendant order, u -rtatn carrages to be shipped to him to India, and a person named Hill, who csrried on a Iarge business in carriages in Dukestreek, CheasPfde, acted a his agent. There being some dispute about the timue of payment, th'e plaintiff wanting to be paid cash and Hil reqniricg him to wait until the carriages arrived in India, the platiff was induced, much against his will, to take a b-il l from HUIl for the amounat. Before the bMl became dne Hill failed, and, according to the plaintifs case, the defendant told him he should not lose a penny in consequence. The present action was then brought to recover the value of the carriages supptied. The defence was that wheLn the defendat called upQn the plaintiff to ordler the carriages the latter said the defenant was a stranger to him, and he could not make the carriages for him. It was then agreed between them that Hill, who was the defendant's agent, should become liable to the plaintiff for the good4 and accordingly Hil gave his acceptance for the amount, which the plaintiff had acceptd in satisfaction of his claim. Evidence was called on both sides to prove their respective Cases. The counsl having addressed tho jury for their respective clients, hMr. Baron MAPRTIN, in summing up, said that the only queston for the jury to decide was whether the plaintiffhad elected to take Hill as his debtor, Instead of the defendant. If they considered that Hill was merely acting as tho defendant's agent their verdict must be in favour of the plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount. GOSING V. TUE SOIt-EASTEIN RAILWAY COPAINY. This was an actlon brought to reover compensation in danages for injurles mstained by the olaintiff in consequence of the alleged neglnee of the defendants' servantcs The defendants pleaded " Not Guilty. MIr. O'Malley and Mr. Henry James appeared for the plaintiff, and r Edwin James and Mr. Petersdorff rep±eEtnted the defendants. It appeared from the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff that he was a young man, and had formerly been one of 31r. Atcheso '- (the architect) assitants, at a salary of it. lOs. per week, with an increase of 6i. per week per annum. On the evening of the 28th of June last the laintiff was returning to London from Woolwich by the lf-past 10 o'clook tratn. On their arrival atthe Lewisham station he felt the train come into collision with Another trvin, and he was thrown forwards against an opposite passenger, and then back against the carnage, wbereby he was considerably injured. He was taken to Woolwich, where he rematned six weeks, attended by the company's medical man, by whose advice he was subsequently taken to Deal, where he remained five weeks. He had sustained; according to the testimony of the medical gentlemen who attended him, a severe shook to his nervous system, and the brain had been greatly shaken. He had been obliged to give up his situation, and as nable to do anything for his living, aud it might be years before he recovered entirely. Mr. EDwiN JAMEs, on behalf of the company, acknow. ledged their liability, and said that the only reason for their allowing such %n action to proceed was, that they were desirous that a jury should asses the amunont which shorla be gven to the plaintiff as compensation for his injuries, r. Baron MASRTIN, in summing up, said that the p laintiff was entitled to recover compensation for the loBs of his situation, for his other pecuniary losses, and akdo for his bodily pain and suffering. The jury wrould say to what compensation they considered the plaintiff was entitled. The jury returned averdict for the plaintiff-Damages,

The printcpal point in the-caso was in reference to a 2001. bank-note, vvhoih the insolvent alleged he had lost, or it bad been stolen from hirm He had been a commission agent. In his first sohedule he put down two debtors to account for a quantity of lace which be had bought, and on the Court dismissing the order for hearing he omitted in his new schedule the two alleged debtors. He stated that he put a 20OL-note in a sock in his drawer, and that In April last, abont tro months beforo' he went to prison, he bad either lost It or been robbed of it, and he made a statement to that effect in the schedule. Mr. CA.RThN treated the alleged loss or robbery as a fiction. and contended that the note had been conealed or The OnrEr Co~nnssrosxn held that the insolvent had fraudulently made away wdth his property, and gave a judgmeet of 13 calendar months from the vesting order, the 20th IN RR EDWARD LODER. This insolvent, who had been connected with a timber company, applied as a non-trader under the Protection Act. Mr. ed opposed and Mr. Sargood supported. An objection was taken to the petition.

MANSION-Ousc,-Emanuel Solomons and John MT'Namara, the former an apprentice and the latter a jonrney. man in the employment of Mrs. Mary Sumner, a jeweller in Church-row, Houndaditch, were brought before the LORD MIAYOR upon the charge of having stolen a gold hracelet and a diamond ring, Of the value of lOO., from the shop of their The LORD MYOR.- Solomons wil be remanded, and M'Namara will enter into his own recognizance in 101. to attend here at the next examination. A woman of about 35 year6 of age, wbo gave the name (supposed to be fictitious) of Mary Ann Ford, was charged with having robbed a merchant's clerk named Edmund Walker of a silver 'watch of the value of ot. The prisoner, who made no defence, but sobbed a great deal, and p~rayed to be allowed to go at liberty, was fully commiteo fortriaL. MARLBOROUG.-sTREET.-A beautiful coffee cup and saucer, richly painted and decorated, and a satin-lined case are in the hands of police-constable Edwards, one of the officers of the court, as the property supposed to have been stolen. It was pledged for afew shiflings at Attenborough's, in Greek-street, and is valued at from IO. to 15. The officer was requested by Mr. BEADON to retain it, as it was not unlikely that an owner might bo fonnd for it. Inquiries were ordered to be made at the Earl of Mansfield's, as property of a similar description was said to have been missed from his Lordship's residence. MAlYLEBON-Catherine Vale was brought up in custody, and charged before Mr. LosNG with having cArried on in a most artful manner a system of robbery to a considezable extent. The prisoner called at Mrs. Webster's, No. 1, Grove-road, St. John's-wood, on Monday morning last, representing that she had been Eent by the laundress for the "things." No suspicion being excited, a basket of clothes was delivered to her, the value of the same being upwards of 41. At the period of the property being given to her, the prisoner stated that the laundress was too iU to call for them herself. On the next day she did call, and then ascertained that the property had been handed over to an unauthorized person. Information was given to the police. and Tyler, 42 G, a most active officer, succeeded in taking the prisoner into custody at 10 o'clock at the Albert public-house, Gray's.inn-lane. She was taken to the Clerkenwelt station, and a servant identified a gown which she had on her and also a frock on a child which prisoner had in her arms as being the property of her nistress. Mr. Grange, who appeared for the prisoner, elicited that the prisoner had stated to the constable that she had pur. chased the articles found on her and the child for 4s. 6d Tne constable said that if the magistrate would remand the prisoner he should no doubt be able to bring forward other cases of robbery of a sinilar kind, and to a large extent. He was of opinion that the prisoner had carried on her nefarious practices for a long period. The prisoner was remanded till Wednesday next. WORSMIrP-1STREET.-Henry Williams, a private in the Tower Hamlets Militia, was charged with assaults. About 12 'clock on the preceding morning Beck, a policeman, was on duty in the Shrubland-road, Dalston, when he found the prisoner engaged in a violent struggle with one of the officers of his own regiment. The prisoner was drunk, had his belt off, and sworo he would not go to barracks, to which the officer was evidentlv endeavouring to get him. Finding he could do nothing with hitu by himself, the officer called upon Beck to help him, but directly he went up the r0ner turned savagely upon him, struck him two violent glows upon tho temple and mouth, the latter of which he much feared had fractared his jaw, and also kicked him heavily upon the legs. The prisoners outrageous coduct collected da large mob of blackguards, and they, as is almost invariably the case, took the part of the o4ender against the constable, whom they pelted with stones, rue of which stuck bin Fo as to eth ijure his head and break his ht. Hayes and Cowan, two other constabler, came up at the moment, and attempted to eecure the prlsoner, but he immediately set upon both of the, etrack ayes three times upon the face And temple, kicked bhs own offloer in the stomach, aud CowAa upon the le,,&, *nd behavod wlth sach extreme violeace that the wNole together could not hold him, and it was not till the gurd had been fetched from the barracks that he was at length overpowered and handcuffed. Cross, a Eergeant of the regiment, also deposed to the violent conduct the prisoner hsd dislayed, which wasso bad that he was obliged to assist in te hawdcLffing. The prisoner was a transfer from some other regiment, and a very pretty transfer he was, for they had much better been without him. His own officer, whom he had so spitefully kicked, could not attend against him, as he was obliged to go with the regiment, which had now started for Newry, and the prisoner ought to have gone with it. The prisoner said he was not drunk; he was only a little too late for the regiment, which the officer found out, and ordered him to the guard-house; he was willing togoto barracke, bui would not to the guard-house, and that was the whole cause of it. Mr. D'EyNcouRT told him tbat he was a disgrace to the regiment, and desered to be flogged. lIe could not allow the police to be lilused by sch a mru as he was, and-he ehould therefore make an example of him by sending him for one month's hard labour to the Eouse of Correotion for one assault, and a fortnight's more imprisonment for the other. CLzRXENw-L Mr. TvRwN-r, the sttin magistrate, requested our reporter to notice that M. The or ontane has forwarded for the poorbox of this court the sum of 11. 12s. 6d., requesting that the same might be acknowled,ged in the newvpapers, Thoma Sayers the present champion of England, appeared before Mr. CORtm in answer to a summons chirging him with fuaiously riding a horse to the danger-of the passengers in the St. Pancras-road. It appeared from the evidenceof Sergeant Holmes, 29 S, and Police-constable Woodrow, 165 S, that on Monday, the 9th, they saw the defendant proceeding along the St Pancras-oad riding n horse at A most furious pace. When near the corner of Walfoid-xtreet he nearly knocked dpwrn two children, but did not stop to see if he had done any Injury. In defence Sayers said, he did not see any children, and was not riding the horse at a furious pace. The police had only taken the summons out against him from a teeling of spite. The defendant was fined the full penalty of 40s. and costs, which he at onee paid. Elita Perkins, a respectably dressed woman, who has -before figured at this conrt nnder otber names, was placed at the bar on remand, charged with defrauding s isa Norrzs, a coffeehouse keeper, residing at II, Albert-terrace, York-road, of the sum of 1S. 5s. Tbe court was crowded with the victims of the prisoner. The facts connected with the case appeared in our impression of last week. The prisoner was now diFeharged, butthe magistrate directed that she should at oneo be taken into cutody and oonveyed before the city magistrates as there were some strong cases against her there. Tmlere could be no doubt that with the planeible tongue the prisoner had sho had vitimized manylkid-hearted persdns, and it was time that her career was at an end. The prisoner was then removed. AI3mB TI-Yesterday having been appointed for the further examination of Mr. James Fenton Wills on a charge which resolved itself into one for which he was Iiable to be tried and punished for an act of blgumy, and for making and signing false declarations to a notice of marriage, the registrars of the district and other witnesses necessary to oomplete the charge were in attendanee to give their evidence. The sympathy excited in the public mind-by the publication of the particulars of this extraordinary ce-for Mrs. Wills, the yonng ladywho had unfortunately been rnade the victim of a double marriage with the brothers Wills, and wbo had been so scandalously deserted by both of them during her affliction and when requiring the greatest care, caused a number of persons to assemble in expectation of being able to hear the further examination; but their curiosity was disappointed by the non-attendance of the accused. At the conclusion of the investigation on Saturday last Mr. Fryer, the solicitor to the famtly and who attended on behalf of James Fenton Wills, applied to Mr. ELLIOTT to admit his client to bail, stating at the time that he (Mr. Fryer) had been taken by surprise in the matter, that he had attended rnerely in compliance with the summons, which was one to show cause why his client, Mr. James Fenton Wills, should not have an order made on him for the srpport of his alleged wife, then chargeable to the parish of Lambeth, and to show his client's non-liability, the lady at the time of her marriage with bim being In fact the wife of his brother John Blair Wills. The learned gentlemnan strongly urged the justice of admicting his client to bail, and the caee being one of misdemeanour only and the evidence adduced not conclusive of his guilt, Mr. EuLLIOTT consented to accept bail for the accused, himself in 80C and two sureties in 401. each. Mrs. Wills, the mother of theacecused, wasputforward as a surety for 80L The lateness of the hour of the evening was urged as an excuse why Ers. Wills should be taken as a surety for 801., and the magistrate having given his consentc the reognizances were taken iD the usual way, James Fenton Wills in 80L and his mother in SOl., the conditions being that both these amounts would be forfeited it he did not appear on the following Wednesdag (yesterday) at this courtL At 2 o'clock MIr. ELLoT called the case on, when it ws stated that neither the accused, James Fenton Wills, his attorney, friends, nor, intact, any person from him, had been seen in the court or its vicinity all the day, and he (Mr. Elliott) at once ordered that the recognizances in the case be estreated and a warrant immediately granted for the apprehension of James Fenton WiUs. Mr. Logan, the superintendent of marriages for Lambeth, was m attendance and produced the notice of maarriage, as required by Act of Parliament 19th and 20th of Victoria, cap. 119, given to him by the accused James Fenton WiUs, and of which the following is a copy :- o1 hthe Saierintandent Registrar of the t1drit1; of laibiti, In the oounty of arrey,-I, the undernIgnied, James Fenton WilLb. hereby give notice that a marriage is lIntended to ibe d by lienee, within tbor calendar meoDtba from the date beeof, between rme and the other party herein nsamed and described; that is to Pay, T&mes Penton WMls, widower, architect, aged 27. resIdIng at 16, Osborn-terr*ce, Clapham-road, and e,Mton Maxwell, spInster, sged 2D. reUIdence aea plceT, h a m tnriner ta gke place at the regletrs office for the didto sbth, In the coDunty of Eiuresy.

MILITARY AND 2YA VAL INCTLLIGRNCB. Tho first division of the 3d Battalion of the Scots Fusileer Guards will leave Portsmouth Garrison this morning for london, and the battalion will follow them on the 20th. They will be succeeded in garrison quarters at Portsmouth by the North Lincoln Militia, who will arrive on Saturday. The authorities connected with the medical department of tho army having decided on haying an additional number of medical officers stationed at Chatham, in order that they may be in readiness to embark for India immediately their services are required, the following officers have been directed to be attached to the medical staff, and will perform duty in the Garrison hospital,-viz., AssitantSurgeons Mossy, Patterson, Jameson, Warren, Perry, Johns, Peppen, and Dohan. The BrllIant, 20, at Chathatu, is to be put out of commison, and, owing to the short time ince she was comnissioned, the ofiicers and crew will be transferred to the Iacoon, 22, screw steam corvette, at Chatbam, Captan J. A. Paynter (1856) being appoiuted to the command. The Heron, 12, sloop, Commander W. H. Trascott, fitting at Chatham for the Coast of Africa, is ready for sea, and is under orders to leave on Monday next. The Gannet, 10 guns, screw steam sloop, is to be launched on the 2d of December at Pembroke dockyard. She is in a very forward state. The court-martial held last week at tho Royal Marine Garrison, Woolwich, for the trial of First Lieutenant Albert Wappel Sharp, of the Woolwloh division of Royal Marine light Infantry, on charges of insubordinate and un-officer. like conduct, reasembled yesterday morning, when the ,entence of the Court, approved and confirmed by the Adz sniralty, was read by Lieutenant and Adjutant Fra-ser, the officiating Judge-Advocate, to the following effect:First. -That First Lieutenant A.W. Sharp, of the Woolwich dlvision of Royal Marine light Infantry, was accused of falsely stating to his commanding officer, Colonel JohnTatton Brown, of theWoolwich division of Royal Marine .lghtInfantry, whensubmitting to him a requestforleaveo-c absence on the afternoon of the 17th of October, 1857, that ids accounts with the mess and the meEsman were paid up ; and for declaring upon his honour on the morning of the 18th that such was a true statement, at which time it appears that a sum of 451. 5s. 2d., or thereabouts, was due from him to Company Sergeant Constant Demorr, officers' mnessman of the division, on account of messing and other items; secondly,-For absenting himself from his duty and parade without leave from his commanding officer en the morning of the 19th of October, he having been pr. viously refused leave of absence by his commanding officer; It appearing that the Court having found the prisoner "N 1ot Guilty" on the firsx charge, and " Gnuilty" on the second, the commissioners do confirm the sentence, ordering FirstLieutenant A. W. Sharp to be severely reprimanded and released from arrest. Two courts-martial are ordared to be held this day on board Her Majesty's ship St. Vincent, Captain H. Eyres, C.B., in Portsmouth harbour. The first is on Licutenant liehard Bradshaw, of Her Majesty's ship Juno, The haUge is:- " That ho did, on board the said ship, on or about the 10th day of February, 1857, sleep upon his watch, and negligently perform his duty whUe officer of the watch and in charge of the said8hip, lyingin an exposed anchorage, where the utmost vigilance was essential." The second is on Mr. Richard Caswell Drewe, late acting master of Her Majesty's ship Juno, on two charges:- " 1. For that he did, on board the said ship, on or about the 10th day of July, 1857, negligently perform his duty and forsake his station, " 2. For that he did, on board the said ship, on or about the 10th day of February 1857, conduet himself with disrespect towards Captain Atephen Greville Freemantle, his commanding officer, by justifying his neglect of duty, and refusing to receive a reprimand from his said commanding officer, which he had justly incurred." The iron screw steamvessel Sharpshooter, 8A has been commissioned at Portsmouth by Lieutenant C. Gib'*on. She is to be manned from the depit of " general service" mien on board the Victory, of whom that ship has several hundred on her books, The St. Vincent and the Blenheim are also overcrowded with them, so that the commissioning of any squadron would be easy just now. The Caesar, 91, screw steam two-decker, was yesterday taken into the dock vacated by the Algiers, sister ship. They are fitting with all despatch for commi8slon if required. A general court-martial, of which Lieutenant-Colonel Jeffreys, C.B., was president, and Major hL Adye, R.A, Deputy-Judge-Advocate, assembled at Winchester on the 1Gth inst. for the trial of Lieuatenant S. C. Matthews, of the 31st Regiment, upon a charge of absenting himself from hi8 corps for a lengthened period without leave froma his commanding officer. The result will not be known until tho Eentence has been approved by the Queen. TEHE MILITIA. Yesterday morning the Southdown Militia arrived at Liverpool from Dublin in the steamers Trafalgar and Prince, and immediately proceeded for their ultimate destination, the camp at Aldershott. In the afternoon the King's Own Regiment, from the Tower Hamlets, went by train to Liverpool,'and embarked in tho same steamers for Dublin, en route for Newry, where they are to be stationed. On Friday (to-morrow) the Trafalgar and Prince steamers will convey the Dublin Militia to Liverpool, en route for Aldershott, and will take back the Shropshire Militia, returning again to Liverpool with the Limerick Militia, and taking back to Dublin the Leceestershire Miltia.
THE NEJW BENGAL LIGHT CAVALRY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I see by the papers that the recruiting for the East India Company'r Bengal Light Cavalry is progressing most favourably. This being the case, why axe not all Indian light cavalry officers at present in England ordered to join the depot at Warley, for the purpose of training and drill. Ing the recruits, so that they may be sent to India soldiers, not mere raw reoruits unable to sit a horse 9 Many officers on sick leave, whose health will not at present stand a campaign in India, are quite Jit for this Idnd of duty in England. By these means the light cavalry would be ready for servlce in a very short time-perhaps not too late to take a part in the present struggle. I am delighted to see that they are to be light cavalry not only in name; and I trust that the Hon. Company will show the same sense in equipping their men as they have in choosing them-viz., " Little and good." Hoping you will be good enough to insert this in your next. lieUeve me, yours very truly, SHARP.
WITCHCRAYT IN STOCKPORT.-A short time ago two glass bottles, filled with a purple fluid, and also containing a hard substance, were discovered by some workmen who vwere lowering the road at Holy-wood, Stockport. That they had been deposited there for some time was evident from the circumstance that long grass was growing over the spot, although there was only a depth of six inches of soiL on analysis the liquid was discovered to consist of dr "on's blood and urine, the hard substance being a number of rass pins. It appears that mixtures of this description are furnished by fortune-tellers to their dupes for the purpose of " bowitching" their unfaithful lovers. Some distance from the place where these bottles were found a canvass rag, filled with brass pins, was also dug up. The pins are presumed to penetrate the heart of the person bewitched. These discoveries have caused considerable excitement in Edgley, and the Stockport A dverfise', from whosereport we have gleaned these particulars, gives various Instances of the superstitious belief in witchcraft which prevails in the neighbourhood. One man imagines himself to have been bewitched by his xother, and fancies that the bottle might be the spell by which he was bound, and that he would be released by its disoovery. On being asked how he knevw that he was bewitched, he replied that his mother had told him so, and he constantlY felt in a state of nervous prostration and depression of spirits, together with a sensation of failing respiration and approaching death. He had, however, consulted a fortune-teller and obtained from her a charm, whereby he could at any time break the spell. On being presed as to the nature of this charm, and questioned wby he had not adopted it, he stated that he had commenced with It, but had not prsevered, and heace Its failure. It was as folllows :-WEe miust stand over the fire, sprinklUng salt upon it, and say, tSalt, cslt, I put thee gnto the fire, May the person who bewitched me neither eat, drink, nor sleep until this spell Is broken." This must be done nine morniungs inx sccession, and be repeated three times on each owcasion. Another instance is that of a professional fortune-teller and anet rlwer. This woman declares that could the parties e etcted 18who deposite the bottles in the earth, the evil Influences devolving upon the bewitched parties would recoil upon theinselves. She however, protested against the immediate destruction of thee bottle by throwing away the liquid into the cesspool, on the ground of the injury that would be sustained by the land on which the Ianure might pltimately be spread; nor must it be shed in the garden, or -vegetation woud be imPaired; and the only way was to break the phial over a running stream, whereby the pericious fluid would mingle with the purer current, and be Imperceptibly, but irrevocably wasted; the bottle being also cast into the water. A third Instance of the existing belief in witchcraft is that of a woman who asserts that her dster -was once bewitched. The spell, she as~serts, could not be broken by ordinary means, as the agency was burend in the bad of the river Mersey, underneath the Wellington bridge arch. Under the auspices of a " wise woman," however, the young woman was caled upon to stand In a particular spot,vat a given time, while an iucentation was gronouncod. Seveoal spirits passed before her, one of whic remrined In front of her for some time." To this spirit the planet., ruler addressed herself, anid it soonL disappeared, together with the young woman's ailments and forebodings.-Mian. chester Gucardian.

THE NOVEMBEAB ARMY LIST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE T[E3S. Sir,-As you obligingly published my letter in your Im pression of the 13th inst., I venture to hope that you will again favour mo with a spaoe in your columns for a few further remarks, as I deem it of great moment that the captains reduced after the war in the Crimea should on reappointment hold their original position in their respective regiments, and this, moreover, at a crisis when every soldier Is of value, especially those of experience. As far as I canm ther from this month's Army Lit the following captains have been brought back to full pay and are now serving under their juniors:- Ca tains reduced to half-pay, Subalternspromotedtotroops November 10, 1856, at the and companies since the couclusion of thevrar with 10th of November, 1856, Russa. and now serving above the captains reduced, their former seniors. 4Tu DRAGOON GUARDS.

I wae rt first puzzled to aocount for the number of cap. tains of cavalry being greater in proportion to those of Infantry; but on referring to Hart's Annual Army Lidt I find that tho cavalry regiments have been increased from slx to eight troops, and the infantry still remain at the strength of 12 companies, to which they were reduced from 16 after the Russian war. This list, which I believe to be nearly correct, shows 15 Icaptains of cavalry and eight of infantry who have to suffer the hardship and mortification of serving under their former subalterns, and It Is eaid that the unfortunates re daily commiserated by non-commissioned officers and privates who cannot comprehend the degradation of their former captains, as they are not aware of any of them having been reduced by a court-martial. But, railkeri a part, this mode of procedure, in my humble opinion, will tend to convert gallant aud efficient officers into grumbling and discontented soldiers, and might induce them in a moment of chagrin and disappointment to send in their papers and retire from a service in which their loyalty and proudest affections are centred. As regards the Royal Regiment of Artillery I believe I am accurate in saying, that officers who have been reduced, and are recalled to full pay, take their former standing as to seniority. I do, therefore, confidently appeal to the illustrious Prince at the head of the army (or to my Lord Panmure, if it lies in his department), and trust that he may see fit to adopt the suggestion thrown out, to antedate the re-appointments of the reduced captains to their regiments With. out bearing back pay. loping that the Decemuber -Army List may show the grievance removed which I have brought to public notice through your instrumentality, I have tho honour to remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

THE CAPE COrONY AND ITS GABRPSON. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Pressed as England now is to suDply soldiers for India, I think it ought to be publicly known how matters are managed in our colonies. It wlll be in every one's recollection that oni the outbreak ln India steamers were sent to the Cape for regiments as one of the nearest points. On the arrival at the Cape of the news, the 80th Regiment at once volunteered for India, They were accordingly marched down to Port Elizabeth for embaration. On arriving there they were ordered to march back again, as only one xegiment would be sent, and that had been embarked. They aecordingly retraced their steps, and had only reached Graham's Town when an order came for the 13th, then statloned tbere, to embark, thus losing much valuable time and sending a fine seasoned regi. ment back to their employment of making roads for the colonists. Surely it would be better to send a few " navvies'" to do that work instead of employing one of the finest regi. ments In the service. The 80th was sent as an extra regiment to the Cape at the time the Caffres threatened to be troublesome. Half the men and all the offioers have long served in India, and fought through all the last war, and are eager to go again. Since they were sent to the Cape, besides other regiments, the Germans have been added to the force in the colony, and the only employment the 80th has had, and has now, as I have said before, is to make roads, whbile England is daily sending off unseasoned regiments or boys as recruits, who only land to be reshipped as invalids, or die at once upon the strand.

MONTAGUo V. HABRRSOIf. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMhES. Sir,-In The Times of the 18th inst., reporting the arguments on the rule before the Court of Common Pleas in this case, you say, in quoting the defendant's aflidavit, "which wasa charge of felony agalst the plaintiff " and in quoting an affidavit of hk. Limebeer you say " that the plaintiff had attempted to get back his goods, and in doing so had taken about 11. worth which did not belong to him, and for this the defendant charged him with felony at the police-court."1 This is wrong; the affidavits did not state so. As regards the plaintiff having taken any goods or being so charged is quite a mistake. The real facts are these - The plaintiff had an execution against the defendant upon e hwa arrested on the 4th of August last, and by the rule you report the defendant claimed to be discharged from custody, on the ground that he was arrested at the suit of the I eaing the polie -cort, where the defendant hadbee tochage ther parties 'with felony, and, being a proscutr, h wa ths prvilgedfrom arrest on civil pro. cliet Iwoul no trobleyou,hutthat issogaeacre againt a gntle~ stading n th positiono h litf lam Si, yur bedentservant.

I BRITISH DEPENADENCIES, NOT COLONIES. TO THE EDITOE OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I cordially concur in the view taken by your correspondent "Zolotes" on the policy pursued by te British Government in dependencies where only a very few of the inhabitants are of pure British blood and lineage. I know by my own experience (and the experience of hundreds confirms mine) that the attempt to govern a crowd of hybrid races, whether of mixed African and mined Indian, or semi-French or semi-Italian origin, just as you would govern a settlemrent of English or Scotch citizens, is a mierable piece of infatuation. In no two things are these people like us. No two principles have they in common with us. No persons can be less like Englishmen in fashions of thought and action than Frenchmen or Southern Italians; and Indians and Aficans are just as unlike. One habit of mind and action all these people have in common. They respect the msigma and exercise of authority. Thev rexmeet jaw wnen it is supported by power. When they reeognize our strength they are docile, tranquil, and obedient. When they fancy that we are weak they intrigue, insult, and eonspire; and they invariably assume that concession and conciliation can ba dictated by weakness alone. As for gratitude, they are not grateful-first, because they don't ask for the things which we give them; and secondly, the only use which they see in them is the means of annoyance to the givers. Poll Sir, every intelligent Englishman who has resided five, six, or seven years in Malta, Corfa, or any other dependency peopled by an alien race. They will all tell you that the best r9gire for preserving order and public peace among the mongrel races of half-French, halfItalians, or half-Greeks, or Malays, Hindoos, and negroes, is a strong military government, perfectly just and inflexibly strict. See the French in Bourbon, Martinique, and Guadaloupe. See the Danes and the Dutch in Sauta Cruz, St. Thomas's, and Surinam. 7Thei have not given a free press, trial by jury, and unlimited emancipation to their subjects. Therefore ther niggers don't parade about 3nobstreperous idleness ; ter offlcers are not stabbed in the streets or murdered in cantonments with impunity. iBut, as for 'he miachiefa of our " liberal" Infatuation, I much fear that ere many years have passed over my countrymen will moarn over them with tears of humiliation and shame.

TO TEE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-Looking over a collection of the letters of " Indophihs " which, has been recently published by MIessrs. Longmau, I findthe following additional notes relating to points upon which questions have been raiaed in other letters addressed to 17w Times I am. T :e A14GLO*INDIAN. Nov. 1S. The tax levied upou opium in India by means of the 3nonopoly and the tax upon spirituous liquors in this country are based upon the same principle-that of placing the greatest possible check agaitns consumption by carrying the tax to the higbest point at which it can be maintained without encouraging smuggling. The opium proauced in Malwa Is exempt from the monopoly, and is brought under contribution by a high countervailing duty levied on its exportation from Bombay. The analogy between the English and Indian taxes upon stimulants will be more clearly seen from the following passage of Mr. M'Cnulloch's Zrealise uipon Wages, under the head of " Condition of Labourers :"-" The repeal, or even reduction of the duties on spirits, tobacco, and malt, would be de cldedly injurious. These duties should be regarded as sump. tuary penalties intended to check the indulgence in perniclous habits and wasteful expenditure. It is contradictory to imagine that it is possible to improve the condition of the labouring classes by giving them increased facilities and greater temptations to plunge still deeper into that intemperance and dissipation which are their scourge and ruin. We are not aware that it has occurred to the financial reformers of China to attempt to elevate the character and condition of their countrymen by cheapening opium and facilitating its consumption in the Celestial Empire. But we take leave to doubt whether such a policy would be more absurd than to attempt to improve the condition of our labourers by cheapening gin and tobacco." It has since been stated that greased cartridges belonging to the Entield rifles taken from our men killed in the unfortunate expedition from Patna for the relief of Arrah were used against us by the Sepoys ; but it must be remembered that cartridges may be used by tearing off the end with the hand as well as by biting them with the teeth. This last operation was prescribed by military regulation as follows :-"iFrst bring the cartridge to the south, holding it between the forefinger and thumb, with the ball in the hand, and bite off the top elbow close to the body." After the suspicions of the Sepoys had been exoited, in consequence of the introduction of the greased cartridge, General Hearsey recommended the adoption of a " new mode of drill," recommended by Major Bontein, commanding the depbt of musketry at Dum Dum-namely, " breaking the cartridge with the hand, instead of bv biting it.1"(" Appendix to P&pers, &c.," pp. 36-38. See also letter from the Governor-General in Council to the Court of Direotors, April 8, 1857, " Mutinies in the East Indies," pp. 3-4.) The Native ArtiUlerymen never objeeted to handling the grease applied to the gun-wheels. As the Sepoys would be employed for life on useful hard labour, and would therefore remain a class entirely apart from the rest of the population until they died, this case is not open to the ordinary objections to the reception of convicts. A committee of gentlemen, landowners, and others interested In the colony of Western Australia, has already offered to take any number of them. The climate of that colony is healthy, and not very dissimilar to that of some of the northern provinces of Bengal. The proximity of the colony to India would facilitate the conveyance of the convicts thither ; the position of it, bounded as it is to the south and west by the ocean, and to the north and east by an almost uninhabited and in many places arid desert country, would render the detention of them when there a matter of little or no difficulty; while abundance of employment would be found for them on public works,suts as the making of roads, the catting of timber, the clearing of land for future colonists, the formation of breakwaters, harbours, &c.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMlfES. Sir,-With reference to a-noticen The Times of the 16th tnst., to the effect that Lieutenant-Colonel H. P. Burn, of the 1st Regiment Bengal Native Infantry, now commanding Delhi, is a son of Colonel Burn, who defended that city against Jeswtnt Rao Holkar in 1804, you have, I am Induced to think, been misinformed. Colonel (afterwards Major-General) Burn left only two sons, Both entered the Royal service, both served through. out the Peninsula, and one at Waterloo. One served in the 27th Foot, and subsequently in the 10th Hussars, and died without issue. The other-and the elder-served in the 9th Foot (having been with the present Sir Colin Campbell a subaltern in that corps at Vimiera), and subsequently in the 3d Dragoons. He is also dead, but two of his sons are now in the Company's service-one a medical officer in the Madras Army, the other a Lientenant in the 43d Regiment Mfadras Native Infantry. These, his two grandsons, are the only descendants, in the male line, in the armies of India, of the Colonel Burn of the Delhl of 1804. I enclose my card. Nov. 17. Your obediert servant, P.S. I ehould, It may be, to avoid misconcoption, mention that Lieutenant-Colonel Stisted, of the 78th Highlanders, is also a grandson of General Burn ; that Lieutenant Freese, of the 6th Madras Light Cavalry, is his great grandson, and that both these officers are now in India ; but I have, as I bave eaid, only referred to the direct male aIne.

By a telegram received here this afternoon we are informed that the screw steamer Jason, on her way from New York to this port, had put into Queenstown short of coals, and would proceed immediately. AcTioN FOR ELE0TIOx ExPENSES.-At the Pontefract County Court on Tuesday last an action was brought by Ir. Wright, the present mayor of Pontefract, against Mr. Oliveira, late M.P. for that borough, to recover the sum of 251. 14s. 3d., being the defendant's proportion of the returning officer's expenses at the last election at Ponte. fract. Mr. Smith, of Doncaster, on behalf of the plaint!% said that there were three candidates on the occaslon referred to r. Mi.Mes, Mr. Wood, and the defendant. In conducting the eleotion the mayorineurred certain expensesforprinting, poll*clerks, booths, professional assistance, &c., amounting altogether to 771. 2s. lOd., and by the Reform and other Acts these expenses were chargeable upon the respective candidates in eqnal proportions. The other candidates, Mr. Milnes and M. Wood, had each paid 251. 14s. 3d., but the defendant, although frequently apphed to, had refused to pay his quota. Mr. Smith denounced it as a disgraceful circomstance that the mayor, to whom the election wrIU was directed, who was compelled to perform an onerous duty, and aaainst whose Impartiality no whisper had been heard, shoidd be subjected to the hardship either of paying the ex penses himself or of seeking redress in a court of jus. tice. Mr. Ferns, of Leeds, on behalf of the defendant, said that a candidate was not responsible for certain items in his account, He might be liable for his proportion of the cost of the poll-olerks and booths, but the charge for printing was too mach, while, as to professional assistance, the mayor was sapposed to know his duties, and if he did not he must pay for instruction. Ultimately an arrangement was made between Mr. Smith and Mr. Ferns for the plaintiff to have judgment for 131.13s. Verdiot accordingly.
UNIVERSITY INTELLIGBNcE. OXFORD. Nov. 1R. DEATH OF TEIB PRINCIPAL OF ST. CARY RALT- I no u ev. rumnp Miss, D.C.L., Principal of St. Mary Rall, died at his lodgings this morning, between the hour of 9 and 10, after an illnems of six days. Dr. Biss ws | member of St. John's College, which he entered in the year 1806, and where he obtained a Fellowship in 1809. He took the degree of B.C.L. in 1815. In 1822 he was appointed one of the under librarians at the Bodleian Lbrary, ard In December, 1824, he succeeded the Rev. John Gutch, of All Souls, as Registrar of the University, an office which he held for nearly 30 years In 1826 he became Keeper of the Archives, and in 1831 Registrar of the Vice-Chanoellor' Conrt. In 184She was appointed Principal of St. Mary Hall by the Duke of Wellington, on the elevation of Dr. Hampden to the Bench. In 1852 he resigned on accotmt o faUing health the University Registrarship, and three years later he ceased to hold the Registrarship of the Vioe-Chanecllor's Court. Increasing infirmities induced him in the present term to resign the Keepership of the Archives. He was a delegate of the press, a commisioner of the market, and for many years clerk of the market. As a man of business he had few equals in the University, and the kindness of his manner fitted him eminently for the position of Registrar, which he occupied for so many years. In the literary world he Is known as the editor of the Diary of Thomas Hearne, a work of much curious interest, which he produced a few years back. He was in politics a strong Conservative, and a firm opponent of recent changes in the University. His charity, kindness of heart, and warmth of feeling greatly endeared him to his many friends, and wUIl make his loss keenly felt. He did much for the elevation of the Hal over which he presided, whose tutorial staff he considerably increased, and whose general character he gretly raised He was, we believe, In his 69th year.

THE NIZAM. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Letters have appeared ia Thae 2Timca, very properly caling attention to the good services rendered to the British Government by the Sikh Rajahs of Putteeala and Jheend during the siege of Delhi, and now that the city has fallen and Lucknow has been relieved, we may, I trust, asme that the tide has turned in our favour in India. I there. fore venture to suggest that there is a muoh more im portant native Sovereign, who during this momentous struggle appears not to have been sufficiently appreciated, and to whom our gratitude Is especially due-viz., the Soubahdar of the Deocan, or, in other words, the "N izam" of Hyderabad. When the Bengal army was almost entirely against us, asslsted by the Oude, Gwalior, and other Contingentswhen some of oar Bombay troope were becoming gradually infected with the strange spirit of this revolt, and even the Madras Cavalry showed symptoms, it not of mutiny, of disaffection, those best acquainted with India looked with intense anxiety to the country of the Nizam, which occupies a central position with regard to the three Presidencies (having the doubtful Southern Mahratta country on the west, the excited Mussulniman population of Kurnaul and Ouddapah on the south, and the not quite pasified provinces of Berar and Nagpore on the northern frontier), foreseeing that upon the conduct of the Niz m's Government, the Hyderabad Contingent, and the large Mahomedan population of Hyderabad and other large towns in the Deccan it maninly depended whether or not the hostility to the British rule would spread over the south of India, almost denuded as It was of European troops. In the Hyderabad Contingent, the artiUery and infantry are composed of Eindostan Sepoys, -at any rate, the greater proportion, intimately connected by caste and relationship with the mutinous Bengal army. The cavalry consists chiefly of Mahomedans, the superior native offlicers being scions of, or connected with, the best Mahomedan families of Delhi, and under the peculiar SiUlahdaree system, ool. leoting about them a body of troopers possessing the same feelings and views as themselves. These were the men who on a former occasion shot their commanding officer, Major Evan Davies, in a mutiny at Mominabad. The nobles and jageerdars of the Hyderabad Court have always maintained large bodies of lawless Rohillas, Arabs, and other foreigners besides partiaUy disclplined levies of Sepoys, to guard their strongholds in various parts of the country, while the armed rabble of the city of Hyderabad are notorious for the'r want of good feeling towards us, and they are all just the sort of people who would gladly join in a cry against the Feringhees. Moreover, our own policy towards the Nizam has of late been excessively harsh and irritating, and we have exacted from him more than we were equitably entitled to, depriving him of the most valuable portion of his territory. Yet, with the exception of the partial mutiny of some fanatical cavalry at Aurungabad, and a trifling mleute at Hyderabad (sufficient, however, to indicate the existence of danger), all has been quiet in the Deccan. The energy exhibited by the Resident at Hyderabad, as weU as by the officers commanding the subsidiary force, has been conspicaous; but, without in any way detracting from the merit of those public functionaries and the European officers serving with the subsidiary force and eontingent, we are bound to admit that this favourable state of affairs during a crisis so important to us is mainly attributable to the character, tact, and good faith of the Nizam's linister, Solar Jung, who has been ably seconded byNeewaub Shums. ool-Oomrah, and other influential members of the Xizani's famUy. It must always be recolected that the present is not an isolated case of attachment and fidelity to the British Government on the part of the reigning Sovereign of the Deccan. Not only in our war with Tippoo did the Nizam render us signal assistance, but on a more recent occasion, during the Mahratta campaign of 1817-18, when the Peishwa and Holkar were in arms against us, his High. ness the Nizam placed the whole resources of his country at our disposal. His troops were not only brlgaded with our own both at Mehidpore and Nagpore, bat the RusseU Brigade (forming the escort of the late Sir John Malcolm) proc8eded farther north than any of the troops of the Madras army. Depots of grain were also formed by the Nizam upon all the routes, and no exertion was considered too great on the part of the Nizam's Government to evince their cordial co-operation at an eventful and important period. When our power shaU be firmly re-established, and the day of reckoning arrives, we shall, I trust, "reward" as wel as " punish," and I shaU rejoice to see the British Go. vernment adopting a substantial method of proving to the Nizam that we realy desire bis welfare and the stability of his reign by relaxing the very tevere financial trammels in which we have bound him, and which must, if continued, inevitably cause his Government to break down. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. F, G. London, Nov. 18.
DUCKS OF PEOPLE.-The Siainese spend three. fourths of their existence in the water. Their first act on awakening is to bathe; they bathe again at 11 o'olook ; they bathe again at 3, and bathe again about sunset; there is scarcely an hour in the day when bathers may not be seen in all the creeks, even the shallowest and muddiest. Boys go to play in the river, JUSt as poor English children go to lay ia the street. I once saw a Siamese woman sitting on the lowest step of a landing-place, while, by a girdle, she I eld in the water her infant of a few months old, splashing End kihckng about with evident enjoyment. Were not these eople pertswimmers many lives wouldbe lost, forthe tide tows so swiftly that it needs the greatest skill and car to I revent boats from running foul of one another; and, of course, they are frequently upset. On one occasion our I oat (an English built gig) ran down a small native canoe contabinng a woman and two little children. In an Instant they were all capsized and disappeared. We were greatl alarmed, and C. was on the point of jumping in to their iescue, when they bobbed up, and the lady, with the £rst breath she recovered, poured forth a round volley of E,buse. Thus relieved in her mind, she coolly righted her canoe-which had been floating bottom upwards-Ladled out some of the water, and bundled in her two children, who had been meanwhile, composedly swimming round her, reajg With mingled fear and curiosity the barbarians who d occasioned the mi8hap.--Dickens's H0ouschotc Word.s.
