Where Lies The Difficulty Of Sending The Unemployed To Australia?
WE-"R LIES THr DIFFCULTY OF SE2DIXG
THE UZBMPLOYED TO AUSRALIA S
TO THE EDITOR, OF ThE TIMES.
Sir,-WMll yot allow me to sy * few words on this most cudous subject? At this Yioment the British empire is exhibiting one of the most extraotdinary sights which it is possible for the imagination to conceive. We have one part of it swarnming with thousands of heiathy And vigorous men, with trades in their fingers and Capacity for active labour in their limbs, who can get nothing to do; and another part of it in great distress, because it cannot get these very men. If the human eye could tako in at onco England and the Australian colonies it would sze the demand in Australia and the supply in England, but no means found to bring the supply and the demand Into contact. It would see thousands of hale and able bodied young fellows meeting in large bodies by 2,000 and 3,000 at a time crying for employment, crowds of such men parading the streets with banners, demanding work or relief, and throngs, of them bosieging the magistrates' offices to obtain the means of existing, thus giving to our continental neighbours a very mortifying idea of our pauperism and destitution. On the other hand, you have the Australian colonies calling loudly for these very men; telling us that they are daily suffering great injury and hindrance from the want of them, and offering the most alluring rates of payment for their labonr. Turn to your own columns of a very recent date, and yol have continual statements like these by your Melbourne correspondent. Advicos from Melbourne of tho 16th of October say, "A steady demand for all kinds of labour continues. Single women are very scarce." By the mail of the 16th of August your correepondent's report is, "Wages have risen. Most of the mechanics connected with building-masons, carpenters, plasterers, puinters,after having reduced their worldng hours from 10 to 8, have lately succeeded in raising their wages from about 14s. to 16s a-day, and that, too, upon mere request, without anything like a strike; and, while their money wages are thus high, the necessaries of life are moderate."
By the overland mail of the 11th of October we learn that the demand for female labour, both for town and country, is increasing. Rough labour of all kinds is meeting with ready employment. There is a better demand for skiled labour, especially among the building trades; and in confirmation the following rates of wages are given :-Married couples without families, from 751. to 851. per annum with rations; married couples with families, from 551. to 65Z.; gardeners, 501. to 554; grooms, 404 to 501.; atockmen, 601. to 7014; shepherds, 351. to 401.; men cooks, 701. to 901.; female cooks, 30Z. to 451; thorough female servants, 30. to 351.; nursemaids, 201. to 251.; housemaids, 251.; laun. dresses, 30 to 354; and all these with their keep of coursecarpenters, 34s. to Ris. per day; masons, 18s.; plasterers, 14s. to 15s.; bricklayers, 14s. to los.; blacksmiths, 12s. to 14s.; quarrymen, 10s.; labourers on the road, Ss. to 10s, per day, wood, water, and tents found.
XNow, Sir, with this want of labour here and this pressing demand for it there, with starvation on this side of the water and 15s. a-day for even working on the roads there, with all kinds of workmen connected with building out of work here, and there offered 14s. and 15s. a-day, what is the reason that our destitute men and women cannot get to this land of promie-from this purgatory and destitution to that paradise of labour? The answer is-want of money to take them. But is the public aware that there are abundant funds provided for this very purpose? A correspondent of yours the other day recommended that Government should furnish ships and the publio subseribe the necessary funds. It is impossible for me to express my astonishment when I hear such propositions, and when I see the difficulty now existing. I ask again, does this country know that the proceeds of the sales of lands in the Australian colonies are appropriated, or professedly appropriated, to this very purpose of conveying to those colonies the ne. cessary labour ? Is the public aware that the Government here expends nothing at all on this object; that this money is remitted hither to Government, and that it generaUy has a very large sum indeed in hand for this object; that it therefore costs Government nothing to send out labour; that it is no charity In thoso who accept such transit, but that they go to give their invaluable services, or a quid pro quo for the money sent; that it is, consequently, thg bounden duty of Government to send al the labour that is wanted, and as promptly as ossible?
While I was in Victcoriain 1852, 1853, and 1854 the proceeds of the sales of lands were generally about 800,0001. per annum. These were almoet entirely the proceeds of town iUotments, and half this amount was appropriated to bringing over labour. Bnt since that time public opinion ha5 compeled Government to throw into the market a considerable quantity of waste lands for agriculture, and therefore the proceeds of these sles must have been large. The question arises, and is at this crisis a most vital question, where are those proceeds? Are they remitted to this country? Aro they now in the hands of Government? Before we give ourselves up to despair, before we ask the pubHl to subscribe the necessary funds to send out our starving labourers, artisans, and workwomen, we ought to put this plain question to Government-have you not ample funds in your hands at this very moment for this express purpose?
For my part, I should not be at all surprised to find that the Government has at this instant half-a-million of such money in its hands-the money derived from the sale of of Australian waste lands transmitted hither for the purpose of sending them the necessary labour. The question should be asked; why should not a deputation of influential city men put it to the Colonial Secretary ? We have heard no complaint from Government of the decrease, far less the lack, of such funds. Bnt it is a curious and a most tantalizing fact that aU along-all the time that I was in those colonies-at the very time that the Argus was by every mail sending the most earnest, pleading, and even agonized appeals for more and more labour, Government, having tied itself up in a knot by certain rules, wxs refusing passages to vast numbers of exactly such men and women as the colony was crying for. Such continues the case to this very hour. I have myself seen hundreds of the most likely men who have expressed an earnest desire to ger out, but could not. Scores have told me that the Emigration Commissioners rejected them on one plea or another while I saw that they were precisely such men as were wanted there; nay, it was but the other day that a local agent of the Emigration-office assured me that he had sent hundreds of the most desirable men and women to the chief office at Westminster who were rejected by the Commissioners on one plea or another. He said he taken infinite pains to assist those people in their endeavours to get out, had himself filled up their papers for them, but to no purpose. With an air of great mortification he exclaimed, "It is useless! There sits in Westminster a gentleman paid 1,0001. a year to send them out, who will not send them out !"
Now, I am not disposed to accuse the commissioner of any intention or desireto obstruct the emigration of suitable people, but such is the real fact, he does obstrnct them. He is, I expect, tied up by technical rules and regulations wholly inapplicable to the present condition and needs, and most prejudical to the interests of both the mother country and the colonies. Let me give you an instance or two of ap. plications within my own knowledge. Some time ago an active young man, a porter in London, applied to me to asist him to get out to Victori I sent him with a note to the commissioner. He was refused. They did not send ont porters. Yet this porter was capable of any rough work and would have been snapped up the moment he landed at 1U. a-day. I sent him into the conntrv to make hay for a month, and thom sent him up again as an agricultural labourer, because that was technical to a hair, and he got out at once.
Twelve months ago a healthy young feUow of 18 was beg. ging at my gate. I upbraided him with his meanness in not working. He said he was astonemason, and would be glad to get to Victoria. aving ascertained the truth of his story, I sent him to the commissioner, and offered to pay the 21 required for him. The commissioner replied that he could not send him to Victoria, that Government could not send any young man to Victoria, because they wonld ran off to the diggings; but he wonld send him to Adelaide. He did so, and now mark the result. I have had several letters from this young felow, informing ma that he had
walked overland to the diggings. That waa sure to be the case. Send ablebodied men to any one of the Australian colonies directly abutting on the gold colony, and they will walk off thither. Where then is the wisdom of refusing to let them go direct, and not ronnd by Adelaide, Sydney, o Tasmania? For my part, I am quite satisfied thab the wisest way is to send out emigrants direct to Victori tiU you have glutted the diggings, and then tho surplus wiU flow rapidly back into all the channels of ordinary labour in the colony, and not till then. And where is the harm ? Any description of labour pays better andis less severe than gold digging, and men soon find this out. As the grocers allow their apprentices to surfeit themselves on sugar, raisins, figs, and the like sweets, so let your labourer take his surfeit of gold digging, and he will become cured of the longing for it. By the latest accounts the population of the Victoria diggings is 150,000. Now, allow 30,000 for storekeepers, Government officials, police, women, and children, and you have L20,000 diggers, who produce on an average 50,000 ounces of gold per week, That doesnot amount to half an ounce perman-not to 35s. per week-while the man who breaks stones on the road can get his 31. Lt your emigrants, then, go the diggings if they like. They wil there be as useful as anywhere else while they stay, for they aill procure that gold.which is so much in demand here; but it is ab,sorbed and disappears as fast as it comes.
One more cas,-There is a letter-veryr in thiis ditrict,
a young active man, with a wife and two or three children., wbo has long wanted to get out to Australia. Re )&m applied to the Commissioner, whose repl i, " We don6t ake out postinen." Bat, uays the young man, "Iam a baker by trade." The reply Is agan, " We don't tAke out bakers." Now, t'his is very extraordinary, for' by a l
published by the Government of Tasmania, and reprinted by me, at the request of the Governor, In my Zoo Years in. Victoa bakers are among the trades particuelarly wanted there; and so hardly has Van Diements Land b1en put to it for all kinds of labourers that the GovernMent lIAs offered A premium of 201. per man to captains of vemsels to take emigrants over. Despairing of getting ny tolerable supply from the home Government ill return for their money, the inhabitants have raised large subsecription;, and ent over successivelY two gentlemen-Mr. Bonney and. another-with the money, to eollect emigrants for themselves.
I repeat, therefore, that what we ought to do is At onoe to Put the plain question to Govermnent-Are there funds in your hands to send out the neoessary labour to Australia
If so, why are not these starving brioklayers, inxsops, plas. terers, &., who are sO greatly needed, sent? If they be mere technicalities, and 'Cirounlocutions" which re the obstructions, will not every thinking man at once agree th?t Government is called upon by every principle of justioe and humanity, by every principle which should guide a Governmtnt, to abandon these technicalities, and send out freely every man who wants to go, and who can lay a brick, foel a tree, handle a spade or a pick on highway, railway,, fence or field, or who en even wheel a barrow for those who ca? 7

London Destitution.
LONDON DSTITrU2IOV.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIEES.
Sir,-The insertion of my former letter on this subject in the columns of 27w& Times emboldens me to request a further, portion of your valuable space.
It is self-evident that charity-alone cannot supply tlbe nece-sities of starving thousands. It is also evident that the parishes which areoverrunwithphupericannot adequatelr meet the claims which under the present* state of the lar are made upon them. Some plan, therefore, mnst be devised to relieve them of a part of their responsibility, and enable them effectuaUy to mitigate the destitution which in the winter season annualy occurg.
This plan may be either emigration or equali2ation of the. poor-rate. To the former there are, I think, insuperable objections. In the firt place, who is to provide funds forthe passage and the outfit? And, in the next plac% is it wise to expatriate the bone and sinew, the physical and mental energy, of our population? What is it that bas raised our country to the greatuess which she now confessedly pose. sesses? The British people have achieved this greatness, and they alone can preserve it. America would have been still a barren and uncultivated land but for the energy of British emigrants. It was wisely aid by an aLcient poet that 'St is better to reign over a land full of people than an empty one;" and we ourselves found out the importance. of this truth when recruits were required for the Rusdan war. EmigratiDn would be a short-sighted policy, and, should not be resorted to before every other means had been tried. It would only weaken the body politic, and transfer to other lands that labour which should be kept to enrich our ovn.
The plan, therefore, of equaizing the poor-rate, and making the rich parishes contribute to the necessities of those that are needy, is much more feasible, politic, and equitable. Those who are best able to bear the burden of the poor are now almost exempt from it, and those who are least able to bear it are sinking under the load. Just as the worst-paid servant in a gentleman's household does the. largest share of the work, so the least wealthy parishes are compeUed to support the largest number of poor.
But one fact is worth a thousand theories. At the present moment the poor-rates in this neighbourhood axe as foUows -
Whitechapel, 5s. Od. in the pound; St. George's-in-the-East 5s. Od. in the pound; Shadwell, 5s. 4dL in the poumd - Ratcliff, 4s. Od. in the pound.
And I should like to know what rates are levied in the richest of the city parishes ; e. g., St. Mfargaret's, Lothbury;
St. Margaret Pattens; St. Martin Outwich; St. Olave,Jewry; and other parishes ful of costly warehouses and shops, with an average population o f about 200 each. I am informed that the Bank of England, the richest corporation, perhaps, in the world, does not pay a farthing of poor-rate,
because there are no [poor within its boundaries; and that. several of the city parishes lay a rate only about once in three years. If this be the case, the sooner the Legislature interferes the better it will be for all' parties.
It would be desirable that a return should be obtained by the House of Commons of the rates which have 'been Paid for the last two years by all the parishes in London and its subuibs, in order that correct information on the subject may be obtained before further steps be taken to remedy so glaring an eviL
The pressure is now gradually diminishing, but the num. ber still unemployed is very great; the applications to magistrates, boards of guardians, and the clergy are still beyond their powers to satisfy. Let us hope that before next winter a more equitable adjustment of this burden will have been made; and to this end I would ask your invaluable co-operation and assistance, not for my own sake, but for the sake of the starving thousands residing in the east end of London, and of those ratepayers who are themselves struggling with unexamp~,led difficulties and verging towards bankruptcy and ruin, 1U consequence of the. unequal incidence of rates which their scanty means do not. enable them to discharge.
I give my address, in order to save trouble to yourself,. and am, Sir. vour obedient mervnnS

The Supply Of Guano.
THBE SUPPLY OF GVANO.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The answer of Mr. Labouchere on Friday to Lord' Nass entirely corroborates the statements in my narrative. of the present position of this question, which you published about a fortnight ago. What the agricultural and shipping interests have now a right to require is that effective steps should at once be taken to secure the Kooria Mooria Islands for Great Britain by protecting the lessees of the Government. Captain Ord received the license, Mr. L%bouchere states, as " a proper encouragement for the discovery of the islands." It is for a period of five years, of which one has been lost by the inability of the Government to afford that protection which the Secretary of State say6 the lessees were informed that they should. if practicable, receive. Had it been granted, as they were led to expect, cargoes of this guano might now have been coming in. As the Government through Mr. Labouchere express their anxious desire still to use every means to increase the s pply of guano, we may reasonably urge upon them an obvious mode of doing so by at once despatching a vessel of war from this country to protect the expedition. There i; still ample time for a ship from this country to reach the islands about the' end of the monsoons in August, and arrangements would in that case immediately be made for extensive ship. ments of guano to arrive here in winter and sprinzI.

Saturday Evening.
The favourable character of the Bank returns and the improvement on tne Paris Bourse caused the English funds to open this morning at a alight nnprovement, which, howrever, was not maintained, the demand for advances and discounts being active. Consols for money which closed yesterday at 93t, were first quoted 93i to i, but the final transactions were at 93i to f for money and 931 to J for the 7th of March. Bank Stock left off at 218 to 220; Reduced, 93i to 94 ; New Three per Cents., 9-4 to J; India Bonds, 2s. discount to is. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to i; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
Foreign securities have exhibited steadiness, but the operations have been limited. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 9og, and for the account at 95i ; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Ctnts., 65; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44A; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 971 and 98; and Spanish Certificates of coupon not funded,
and J.
'The inal quotations of the Erench Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 90c. for money and 69f. 95c. for the end of the mbnth, showing continued firmnees in consequence of m'oney purchases.
About 40,000l. in gold was taken from the Bank -day for transmission to the continent in payment for silver.
The suspension was announced this afternoon of Messrs. C. Fraughiadi and Sons, Greek merchants, -with liabilities, principally on acceptances, for about 80,0001. The connexions of the firm lay between London, Liverpool, Galatz, and Alexandria. It is said that their assets show an apparent surplus, but that part of them are abroad. A meeting of creditors is to be called at an early day, and if no unforeseen difficulties arise 25 per cent. can be realized without much delay.
A considerable number of vessels may now be considered nearly due from Australia. The Blackwall, Ocean Chief, and Mermaid, from Melbourne, and the Primula, Maid of Judah, and Vocalist, from Sydney, are all believed to have been between 80 and 90 days out.
. The Board of Trade have issued an account of the Customs' duties received during the past year as compared with the two preceding years. The subjoined table shows the total, distinguishing the amounts obtained from the 13 principal articles. In every case an increase is exhibited. It is to be noticed that the sum raised from all articles beyond the 13 specified is only 544,9401., and the public will be surprised tO learn that according to a return lately obtained by Mr. Ewart there are stil 139 descriptions of goods held liable to duty which severally yield to the revenue a less amount than lO,QOOI. Out of these 139 there are 31 which do not bring in so much as 201. each. From the figures for 1855 it appears that ammunition, essence of spruce, manna croup, and perfumed powder contributed 11. each to the national Exchequer:-
The railway meetings of the week ha-ve again been numerous. The London and North-Western dividend will be at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of about 4,5001., the proposal of the directors to distribute at the rate of 5i per cent. having been defeated. The points brought under consideration were the results of management, the necessity for economy, and the contemplated expenditure of 350,0001. for the construction of the third line of rails from Willesden to Bletchley and other works, and 25,3601. on various stations and sidings for increased accommodation. According to the report of the South-Eastern Company, the net balance available for dividend on the ordinary consolidated stock is 187,4031., which, after the payment of 15s. per 301. stock, or at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum for the past half-year, will absorb a sum of 185,8421., leaving a balance of 1,5611. The report of the Eastern Counties Company states that, including 3,4661. brought forward from last account, the available amount is 80,4381. As the directors propose to declare a dividend of 5s. per share, which will take 72,9201., the sum remaining is 7,5181. Great attention has been paid to economy in the various departments, and several unprofitable arrangements have been modified and others terminated. At the Blackwall Railway meeting the dividend at the rate of 3s. 6d. per share was confirmed, and the report was agreed to. It is stated that the Eastern Counties Company show a disposition to use the line for short traffic. The agreements with the North London Railway and the lessees of the Tilbury Company and the Victoria Docks, respecting warehouse accommodation, have been aanctioned by a majority. The report of the Scinde Railway has been adopted, and the whole of the speakers directed attention to the advantages of the undertaking in a commnercial, political, and military point of view. The dividend declared at the meeting of the Blyth and Tyne Company was at the rate of 8 per cent, and the prospects of traffic are considered satisfacfactory. The Morpeth branch will shortly be opened for the use of the public. At the adjourned meeting of the Great Western Company the result of the poll on the question of the amendment was declared to be a large majority in favour of the directors. Explanations were entered into with respect to the coal traffic, which appeared to be satisfactory to the greater number of shareholders. The report of the Midland Company states that there has been a large iucrease in the traffic of the line. The dividends proposed are 2i per cent. on the consolidated stock; 28a. 9d. per cent. on the Birmingham and Derby; 3 per cent. on the preferential stock and Erewash Valky stock; 2-5 on the 4i per cent. stock; 2 per cent, on the Leicester and Hitchin preference stoek; and 2 per cent. on the o5l. shares, leaving a balance of 16,0001. The dividend of the Bristol and Exeter Company will, it is expected, be at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. The South Wales dividend is at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on the ordinary stock; after payment of which there will be a balance of 4,0161. At the adjourned meeting of the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway the proposed lease of the line to the London, Brighton, and South Coast Company was agreed to. The report of the Cork and Bandon Company has been carried, and the dividends have been declared on the preference shares. The dividends of the Hull and Selby Railway have been declared as follows :-21. 9s. 6d. on each 501. share; 1t. 4s. 9d. on each 251. share; and 12s. 4id. on each 121. 1Os. At the Northern and Eastern meeting the usal guaranteed dividends at the rate of 5 and 6 percent. were declared. The dividend announcel at the Royston aud Hitchin meeting was at the rate of 6 per cent., less a charge for the expense of management. The question for arrangement with the Great Northern Company to pay the rent by which this charge could be reduced was discussed, and it will again he brought forward at a special meeting. at the Salisbury and Yeovil meeting the report detailing progress was adopted, and the contractors are nlow prepared to proceed wherever the land can Be furnished to them. The Bradford, Wakefield, and Leeds line is to be ready for opening in [June, and arrangements have been made with the Great Northern and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Companies for working it, and with the Leeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction Company for using a certain portion of the line. The available balance of the South Yorkshire Company will, after the payment of the guaranteed charges, allow a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. The directors of the Maryport and Carlise Railway recommend a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. upon all shares, both original and preference. The traffic is regarded as satisfactory, and there has been a sli,ght decrease in the expenditure. At the Edinburgh and Bathgate meeting the dividend for the half-year was declared at the rate of 4s. 9d. per share. A portion of the debenture debt is now due, which the directors hope to tenew on leMt onerous terms. The shareholders of the Ulster Railway have agreed to the dividend at the rafe of 6 per cent., and have adopted the report. A resolution was passed authorizing the directors to borrow 50,0001. for the extension line, and they were also empowered to deal.with the preliminaries respecting the Belfast and WVest of treland project. The report of the MÂ§adras Railway is considered en-
5ouraging, and, as the manager's staff is efficiently and economically organized, the board look with confidence to the developement of traffic under improved arrangements. At a meeting of the Madras Company a resolution has been adopted that any interference of the local Government with the traffic fares, Buch as would prevent the profits reaching' 10 per cent., woVId violate the spirit of the contract entered into by the East lndia House with the Indian railways.
A prospectus has been issued of a County and General Gas Consumers Company, with a capital of 50,0001., in 51. shares. The object is to supply gas to small places which have not yet obtained its benefits-namely, villages and towns with populations varying from 2,000 to 5,000 and upward.
Advices from Smyrna state that some valuable coal mines in the valley of the Meander, about 40 miles from thatcity, have lately attracted attention, and are likely to be made available for commercial purposes.
The annexed information with regard to the progress of English mining adventure is condensedfrom the Missing Jmnal *-
" There has been little improvement in the share-market. The standard is watched with some anxiety by intendinz purchasers, in the expectation that any serious decline will have the effect of reducing the prices of heavy dividend stocks. At St. Ives Consols meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of the mine of 9801 - adividend of 81. per share was declared, and 2281. 1gs. 6d. carried to e credit of next account. At Wheal Clifford meeting the accounts showed a balaLce in favour of adventurers of 2 4191L a dividend of 8. per share was declared.

At Nanteos and Penrhiw meeting the accounts showed a balane in favour of the mine of 1801. At Gramoler and St. Aubyn meeting the accounts showed a profit of 7491.
With regard to foreign mining, the following is the principal paragraph of interest :-
"At Strathalb 'n kining and Smelting Company meeting articles of a conditional contract entered into with the committee of management of the South Australian Copper Mfinig Company for the purchase of the property and assets of that company was submitted, and the articles of association prodned and signed by allpresent. At Clarendon ConsolidaUed lining Company of Jamaica meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of the comany of 7,8521 The Imperial Brazilian lining Association have advices from Gongo Soco to the 31st of December. No improvement had taken place. The produce for the month had only been 41b. 8oz. 14dwt., against 71b. 5oz. l8dwt. in the previous month. The National Brazilian Mining Association have received advices from Rio de Janeiro. Captain Hitchins had proceeded to the mines, but, owing to the bad ireather, which rendered the roads impaasable, no despatches have been received by the last mail. The Mariquita Company have advices, of which the follow. ing is an abstract :-Santa Ana mines for November .- Cost, $8,577; returns $15 471- returns for December, $21,305; cost not yet received. iurima mines for Novemra ber:-Cost, 5,088; returns, $3,710; this cost includes the cost of new mill, $499. The superintendent sates that the returns were iijurious affected bv a large earth slide In the western streams. lhe Australian M3ning Company are in receipt of advices from their agent, Mr. Foster, dated October the 29th, 1856. 30 tons of ore were at port awaiting shipment, and the reserve at Tungkillo had been let at 2001. a.year. The local Government had also signified its intention of resuming several acres at Tungkillo for the purpose of maldng roads. The advices from Jamaica extend to January the 24th. At the Clarendon Consolidated Coinp ny's mines the operations were proceedng satisfactorily. The 58 crosscut is progressing favoubay. At Wheal Jamaica they had about 50 tons of dressed ore ray for shipment. A new lode had been just discovered, vhich enhanced the value of the property considerably. At Ellerslie and Bardowle the company expected to make the first shipment of ore in the course of two months. At Rio Grande they have just commenced active operations."

There were present uPvard. of 100 prorietorsand the following
Directors:-
Chairman.-Sir Eenry Mduggeridge.
Depusty-Chalrman....,ohn C umbfrlnrl wRn
'1'he Chairman expressed the Satisioation which the directors felt in having the opportunity of meeting the shareboldere, inasmuchas they were in a position to asure them that the success of the association had far exceeded their most sanguine expectations, Dring the past four months the compay had isnued 290 new life policies, giving an annaual income of Â£44 31 14s. lOd. and effected during the same period fire nsurances to the amountoi nearly two millions and a quarter, prodlucing annual premiums to the amount of Â£3,442 17s, 81 or a total new premium income in the four months of Â£7,974 12s. od. He need not, however. say that the dlrectors exercised the greateet amont of caution in conducting the busineess le hogged to move the first resolution, authorizing the directorasto mwake application 00 and solidtC a IilimParliament for enlarging and amending the powers of the association.
Mr. Knidght, M.P., seconded the resolution, and confirmed the state. ment of the chairman with respect to the rapid progress and satisfactory state of the association.
Tne resolution was then put, and carried unanimously In relyto a question from Mr. Gunton,
The Chairman said the expense of the proposed Act of Parliament woulid be about Â£60 or T970.
The t0oUcitor then read and explained the several clausos of the
Hurrougb, M.P., inquired under what name the directors intended to go to Parliament.
The Chairman rephed, the present name, and added that there was no intention at present of altering it.
Adiscussion ensutd asto the propriety of altering the present name, in which Messrs. Aste, Cox, Gmnton. Mann, lturrough, and others took part, the feeling of the proprietors being m opponition to any change in the name. O i o
Mr. Cnmberland and Mr. Robb explained that the connexion between the association and the Bank of Lonidon was that of friendly co-operation and community of interets, and that the two institutions must of necessity be separate aLnd distinct both as regards objects, constitution management, capltal, liahilltiet2 andengagements, as well as being under different Acta of Parliament ; but that both had it in their powerto render mutual assistance by extending each other's con. nexions.
Air. Clench, the manager, in reply to questions, mid that the number of shares alreadytakenupwas140.000, representinga i teid uncapitalof Â£140,000, and a subscdbed tal ofÂ£ 700,000. Ta heiuossehad only amounted to Â£1,100, and co life losses to Â£2,400 which included claims of which notice only had been reoeived. TAe amount received for life premiums was upwards of Â£13,000, and fire. 24LOiO. The income of the asociation was now at the rate of upwards of Â£50,000 per annum.
Mr. Murrough, M.P., said he np posed, after what he had heard, he need hardly ask the question wheoer the dividend of Â£9P per cent. palid to the proprietors the other day was paid out of capital or not.
Mr. Clench said he thought the best way to answer that question was to lay before tho meeting the result of the financial working of the company down to the present period, and then to leave the hon. proprietor to form his own conclusion as to the fund out of which the dividend was paid. (lHear, hear.) The revenue account showed that they had received between Â£18,000 and Â£19,000 for premiums andinterest on investments, and, afier paymeut of the dividend to the proprietors, life losses, fire losses, charges for management, current expenses, premiums on cross assurances, and every outlay chargeable to revenue account, there was a surplus of income over expenditure, as the result of the four months' trading, amounting to nearly Â£10,000. (Cheers.)

The half-yearly meetinT of the proprietors was held at York on Friday, Mr. H. . Thompson U the chair.
The C NANRm", in moving tho adoption of the report, said, the great feature of it was that the traffic of the past half-yearhad continued to maintain that moderate rate of progress which had existed for some years past. The directors might have declared a dividend of 5 per cent. on the Berwick section, and of 4 per cent, on the York secon. If they had done so, however, the balances would have been considerably less. In declAring a dividend of 42 and 3i per cent. upon the Berwick and York sections respectively, th
directors were influenced by the circumstance that a con. siderable amount had been credited this half-year to revenue for interest on unproductive works, especiaBy the Auckland branch, which was now open for mineral traffic, but which had not been, as he contended it ought to be, authorized to be opened for passenger traffic by the Board of Trade. He held out hopes that this authority would be obtained before long. He also thought the position to which the Leeds section had now attained was very satisfactory, seeing that all arrears had been cleared away, and that all matters in dispute as between the ordinary and preference shareholders in that section were at an end. (Applause.) This, however, was not all. The directors were enabled not merely to declare the dividends he had mentioned, but they had made provision for contingencies to an extent which must be considered very satisfactory as putting the property on a sound footing. Heo had examined the transfer and share departmenta of this company, and the result was perfectly satisfac-
Mr. Alderman LEE2Az seconded the motion for the ado tion of the report.
Tr. CuAmPIEY, Mr. Jol-s, Mr. Joiso.N, and Wr. BARTLIFF asked a few questions, and offered some suggestions; after which
Mr. Snrnis made a long speech on the question of extensions, to which he expressed his decided opwsition. He alluded speciall to a Tort branch which the orth-Eastem proposed to make to the Conside Ironworks.
The report was adopted, and the dividends therein recommended were declared. The directors were authorized to consoldate the Leeds Northern shares into stock.
The retiing directors-Mr. Leeman, Mr. Plews, Mr Hodgson, Mr. Seymour, Mr. Priestman, and gr. Macleawere re-elected, as was also Mr. Bywater, the retiring auditor.
A vote of thanks to the Chairman terminated the meeting.

Onr July3, 1855,562,0001. was autborized to be raised on shares for t e purchase of the Thames Haven line. In the session of 1856 the sum of 55,0001. on shares and 40,0001. on loan was authorized to be raised for completing a double line to Southend, and also 200,0001. on shares and loans for te Bow and Barking branch. Upon the whole of the share capital the lessees have contracted to pay interest at 6 per cent. Per annum and half surplus proffts. The line was completed to Sonthend in June, 1856.

The expenditure to the 31st of December amounted to 33,5261.
The CHAIR?MAN, in moving the adoption of the report, observed that the progress of the works had been so rapid and satisfactory that he thought he was fully justified in the promise which at the first meeting he had held out to them, that they would speedily receive a return upon their capital, for before many months were over they would be in a position to commence the carrying of traffio upon the hine. The contractors were executing the works in a prompt and efficient manner, and the engineer was satisfied that the line, when completed2 would be as well and solidly constructed as any lne in the kngdom. Every day showed the import.ance of the communication wvhich the line afforded with the Thames and the port of London, and he believed that there was none on which there would be a greater proportionate amount of traffic. (Rear, hear.)
Mr. P. DAVEY seconded the motion. He thought that they had every reason to congratniate themselves on the prospects of the line, and he hoped that when next they met they would be at least upon the eve of opening.
The resolution was unanimously agreed to.
Mr. J. Blake and Captain Bulkeley were re-elected directors, Mr. boates was re-elected an auditor, and the proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to Lord ViUiers.

A Burglar Shot By A Clergyman.-The most
A BuRuLAR SHOT BY A OLmRGYMAs ,-The most daring case of burglary which ever took place in Derbyshire occurred between 1 and 2 o'clock on Saturday morning last at the residence of the Rev. J. Nodder, of Marsh-green, Ashover, about eight miles from Chesterfield. The house in which the rev. gentleman resides stands by itself in a seeluded place about half a mile from the village. Mrs. Nodder slept in a room in front af the hall, and Mr. Nodder in an apartment at the back of the building adjoining the servants' bedrooms. An infant about seven weeks old slept in a cot in Mrs. Nodder's room, but it awoke between 1 and 2 o'clock; while Mrs. Nodder was attending to it she heard a DoiSC, which she first thought was occasioned by her busband stirring the fire in his room, and she took no further notice of it. In a minute afterwards she heard the noise azain. and went to the window of her bedroom and drew the blind a little on one side, when she saw the figure of a man outside the window and close to the glass. She was in her nigh, dress, and imnaediately drew back. put on her slippers, lifted the baby out of the cot with one hand and rushed out of the room, shutting the door after her and holding it in her hand. 'While she was doing this six of the lower panesof glass in the window and the centre framework svere smashed, and two men entered the room through thd window by means of a ladder, which they had procured from the stackyard adjoining the house. Mrs. Nodder held the door until she was overpowered, when she rushed into a passage on the stairs and locked the door, leaving the burglars fastened in the room. They were provided, however, with a "j emmy " or small crowbar, and with this instrument they broke the panels of the door, and nalocked it, and so got into th'n passage communicating with the bedrooms. The first room they entered was that occupied by a lady named Miss Heeley, a niece of the rev. gentle. man, who was so alarmed that she lifted up the lower sash of the window and jumped into the yard, a height of 14 feet, with nothing on her but a nightgown, and in this state ran for three-quarters of a mile into the village to the rectory-house. After escaping from her room Mrs. Nodder went into that occupied by her husband, and called out, " Papa, papa, here are thieves, and they'll murder ns." She had locked the bedroom door after her, and Mr. Nodder jumped out of bed and armed himself with a pair of large horse pistols which were loaded on the top f a cupboard, which contained the rev. gentleman's plate. The burglars outside called out, "Now, lads ; now, lads, cnme on, they're here !" 33r. Nodder, who was in the room, called out, " If you enter here I will shoot you." The burglars took no heed, but prized the door open, and one of them entered the room with a black mask over his face, and a black gown on his body, which eovered his clothes. He had a canidle in his left hand, wbich be held donv n towards tho lower part of his body. Mrs. Nodder, who was greatly alarmed, said to lher husband, " Oh, my dear, give them what they want, or they'll murder us." Mr. Nodder stepped about three yards back, said to the man, " I'll give you what you want," and fired one of the pistols at thc man, and the shot entered his abdomen. The burglars now made a precipitate retreat, and astlle m.an ran the shot fell froni his clothes. They fled into a bedroom and jumped through a vwindow, taking the glas and framework with them. They had to alight in the yard, which was about 14 feet from the ground, and adjoining the window throughwhich Miss Heeley had jumped a short time before. Mr. Nodder rang the alarm bell immediately, which brought about a dozen persons to the place and a search was immediately instituted for the wounded man, as it was believed that he was so crippled with the shot and the leap through the window that he could not escape from tho neighbourhood. Information was also given to 3r. Hlolmes, saner. intendent conestable of the district, and also to Mr. ladford, superintendent of the Chesterfield borough police,both of wh m made a minute investigation of the premises. The burglar wvho had been shot left traces of blood in the direotion in which he had ran, and the marks of blood and peces of flesh on the window through which they had leaped left no doubt that eitber one or both of them were severely cut. A large yard dog which was turned loose at night made no alarm, it having been drugged. Footmarks were traced from the lhall across the flower garden and in the direction which they had run by Mr. Radford, Mr. Milnes, a county magistrate, who resides near, and Mr. Nodder himself; and in a field about 200 yards distant Mr. Rad. ford found a mask and a dress which had been used as a disguise, and three others were found during the morning, clearly showing that at least four persons were engaged in the burglary. Miss Reeley, the lady alluded to above, lies in a precarious state. She is suffering severely f om an injury to tho spine and great nervous e3citement. T>e police have obtained a clue to the burglars, which we hb't will lead to their detection. A butcher who was travelling from Wirksworth to Chesterfield market. overtooki a roan at lieletedge, near Ashover, whoso leg was bandaged up and much swollen, and who lay by the roadside, just within a gate. The man, wzhose hands were cat, asked for a ride to Chesterfield, and he gave the driver is. to take him. He was sisted into the cart, and gave two ,different stories of bow he had become lame. First he said he had been robbed, and secondly he said he had been engaged in a prizcfight for B01-. On their arrival at Chesterfield the man was pat down at the White Horse, where be had his boots and clothes cleaned, and he was conveyed to the Chesterfield station in the omnibus, and too; a ticket for Derby. From what information has been gleaned there is reason to believe that the burglars belong to a Nottingham gang,

ThO market is rather quieter, and prices a shade easier today, In consequesce of cotton having receded a little, but this only applies to some few classes of goods and yarhs. For fine numbers of twist and doubled yarn there is sufficient business to keep values very firm, and in India shirtings and other fabrics seUers are unwilling to take loes than the rates paid on Tuesday. Bayers are operating only for limited quantities, and the distrust of the cotton-market, from a belief that the present high rates wil not be maintained, is inducing all partses to keep stocks as low as possible. In few, if any, instances is the advance yet obtained in yarn and cloth adequate to the rise in the raw material, and every advance of cotton for some time past has consequently lef t the producer in a relatively worse position than he was before. A circular has been issued by a committee appointed at a meeting of the trade, with a view to furthering the suggestion of Mr. Bazley for a cotton league to encourage extended cultivation of the cotton plant in the colonies, and it is proposed that members of the association shall sabscribe 2s. 6d. per horse power in their mills per annum, to carryout theo objects proposed-that is, the gratuitous supply of seed for experiments, of machinery for cleaning cotton, and separating it from the seed, for prizes to induce extended cultivation, and other purposes of a like nature.
BIRMINGHAM, FEB. 2L
There bas been no material alteration in the iron trade of South Staffordshire. It remains. steady, bnt the influx of orders into the district has not been so great as anticipated in the early part of January. Rails continue to be in fair demand, and many of the first makers have orders on hand which will keep them in full work for some weeks to come. The prices of best mino pigs are well supported, but inferior cinder qualities may be bought at any rates, according to the necessities of the makers.
Notwithstanding new collieries recently opened in Staffordshire, large quantities from Derbyshire and Licostershire continue to be brought into the iron districts, and find a ready market, Tlheso supplies have the effect of keeping down prices; and the best descriptions of thick Stafford shire find a better market in London.
There has been little change in the state of the various manufwctures of the town and neighboarhood. The high prices of all descriptions of metal operate injuriously. A meeting of persons interested in the manufacture of tin wares has been held during the week, at which it was resolved to reduce discounts,-that is,advance prices of manufactured articles by 5 per cent. Comparative slackness is the consequence of these constantly recurring advances, otherwise the travellers for factors' houses represent that the stocks of tradesmen throughout the country are low, and that if prices had been steady an unusually large trade wrould have been done during the presentspring and ensuing summer months. For de rontions of hardware not affected by the advances in copper and tin there isat presenta considerable demand. The heavy and light steel toy trades have improved, and there is also at the present time, a
might, be expected a great demand for agricultural imPsements and all descriptions of gardening tools.
Generally the large foundries in the nei hbourhood are pretty well employed, and tenders for zailay contracts have been advertised for, which give additional hopes as to the future. The chainmaker. are busy, sad bothat Westbromwich and Walsall the holow ware manafacturers and saddlers'ironmongers are tolerably active. At Smethwick affairs wear-a somewhat gloomy aspect. The old contracts at the London Works are under the sanction of the Court of Chaicery proceeding, but these cannot be expected to last long, and ultimately, it is feared, this immense establishment will be clqsed.
The report of the directors of the Birmingham Banking Company, presented at their annual meeting held on Wednesday, has given general satisfaction. After making provision for bad and doubtful debts, the net profits amount to 42,012L Aleady 20,0001. had been taken from this amount to pay thse half-yearly dividend of Os., and the bonus of 10X. per share in September last, and now another of 10s. per share and 10s. bonus was declared, leaving a surplus of 2,0121. to be carried to the guarantee faud. Twenty-eight years ago the Birmingham Banking Companv was established in 201. shares, I01. per share of which have only been paid up. The drivsdends for the last few years have been at the rate of 2l. per annum for the 101. per share paid up; and, more than this, since the establisfmentqf the Bank 100,0001. has been added to the original capital of 200,0001., makihg its aggregate capital to amount to 300,00OO. The directors of the Birmingham Town and District Bank anngunce a dividend of 5s. per share, and a bonus of 2s. 6d. per share, being 7 ' per cent. for the halfyear, free of income-tax.
NOTTINGHAM, FEBc. 21.
The dewand for lace has been active. Anumiber of home trade buyers have visited the warehouses and operated freely; and a few Germans have also been in the market. All the machines are weU employed, and machine builders are busy in constructing new ones. The fire on Thursday last at Mr. Berry's factory was the most serious event of the kind that ever occurred in this locality. The machines destroyed, which were of the most costly description, cannot be rebuilt in. less than three or four years, and then only by a vast outlay and the loss of a valuable opportunity of realizing profit. They were eDgaged in making plain nets, curtains, silk laces, and silk quilgins.
For hosierythe brisk demand previously reportedcontinues without check, every description of goods suitable for home use being carried off as fast as they can he produced. Prices are sensibly higher this week than last, and a good many orders for yarns have been placed with spinners at full list prices. Old stocks in the hands of manufacturers being ex-
austed, a struggle for advanced prices between manufacturers and buyers has fairly commenced. The rates of
gods must be higher if present prices of yarns be continued.. Vholesale houses seem very reluctant to give.the rates now demanded for goods, but stocks in their waiehouses are so low tlsat they have no alternative. Several spinners have notified their intention of advancing the lists on Monday next fron 6d. to ls. a-bundle. This will make an average rise of 5d. to Gd. a-pound on cotton yarns since January last, not more than one-half of which has yet been added to the price of manufactured goods. The full rates will now, however, come into operation immediately, and all parties are an-xiously looking forward to see what wrill be the effect upon demand. At present there is great activity in all branches of framework-knitting. The wvorkpeople are abundantly employed and well paid.
LEICESTER, FEB. .21.
There isvery little, if any, improvement in the demand for home consumption. In cotton goods, however, there is still a fair trade doing - there are some orders for the United States in hand. Wools continue at an extravagant price. Worsted yarns are without alteration, spinners working short hours. At Hinckley and in the country districts trade is without alteration.
The annual report of the Leicestershire Banking Company states that the netiprofits of the bank for the past year, after making ample provision for bad debts, amounts to 22,5711., in which sum is included 7871. for interest on the guarantee fund. The directors paid a dividend for-the half year ending the 30th of June of lt. 5s. 6d. per share, free from income-tax, and recommend a similar dividend now, being 10 per cent. upon the paid-up capitaL After the payment of these dividends a balance of profits, amounting to 7,651?., will remain,out of which the directors propose to take 5,000t. and add it to the capital, in the proportion of lt to each share. If the proprietors adopt these recommendations the directors hope to be able within a shortperiod to increase the capital of the bank to the desired amount of 150,0001., without any further call upon the shareholders.
In the state of the hosiery trade there is not much improvement. Cotton goods for the American market are making, but in nearly every other branch business is quiet Both yarns and wools continue extremely dear. . -
LEEDS, Tsn. 21.
The wooUen cloth trade has rather improved, and is'now very active. Light summer goods seU well, and the demand is quite equal to the present supply. The great bulk of the buSness is done directly between manufacturers and merchants, and hence but comparatively smaU stocks are brought into the cloth-halls; and the business done in the public markets continues of the like character. The tone of the market today has been cheerful, and prices have an upward tendency. The merchants state that the demand for both the home and the export trades is to aful average extent for the season of the year. Wool is firn in price, but not much business has been done this week by the local brokers, all persons waiting to see what turn the forthcoming sales of colonial w.ool in the metropoLis may take. Manufacturers who have bought to supply their immediate wants have had to give prices fully as high as they had to pay the week before, and
Tho flax and silk trades are rather improving, and more work IS being done in the former branch.
BRADFORD, FEB. 21.
The worsted trade presents little change, hut the alteration is for the better. Theoinfluenceoof the spring demand for pieces is already experienced. There is a full attendance of buyers in the warehouses, and an extensive selection is freely made of seasonable goods; the ruling prices, although below the requirements of the manufacturers, have a tendency upwards, and doubtless on the completion of contracts now on hand enhanced rates wiU be obtained.
An improvement is noticeable in the demand for yarns for home consumption; while the export houses, as regards both combed and carded qualities, offer a slight advance. Cotton warps manifest more firmness; *in the finer numbers of singles there is a hotter trade; but, generally, speaking the amount of business in the cotton departmeont, now so important abranch of this trade, is rather dull. It is an-
ticipated thata proper adjustmuent of pices bet;7espin I',' and merchants will very shortly take place, and that large orders, which are for the present delayed, will then come into the market.
Conibing qualities of wool, especially the finer long-stapled sorts, fully maintain their recent firmness, and the sales are merely for immediate use; middling and low qualities, without any actual decline, are hold rather easier, and the
staplers exhibit a perceptible disposition to part with their stocks at the present high market value. Clothing descrip. tions of wool find purchasers at full rates.
The creditors of Messrs. Jennings and Hargreaves met esterdayAn offer of lOs. od. in the pound was declined
y the body of creditors, who, however, expressed their willingness to accept 12s. 6d., and the question stands ad-
journed for further consideration. It has been stated that
the whole stock, nearly 40,000 pieces, would realize fully 20s. in the pound.
HALIFAX, FEB. 21.
Piece goods move off seasonably well, and the sales are rather increasing. There has also been more done in yarns, hut spinners complain of the lowness of prices. Wools re-
main without alterationas to price, but the demand has rather improved.

Taeontinuedlowering tendeney of the grain markets has created consderable activity among the holders of stocs of old whest, and in all parts steam threshing machines are being set to work to get the wheat ready for moarket.
The stands in the Corn-Exchange thhi morning wreo welt fillod with wheat, but the malority of the parcels were of inferior quality. Trade was languid, aud a roduction of is. to Is too pliace on all qualities excePt the very finest.

The sapply of barley fit for malting was short; it was taken off resauly at the terms current a week ago. For the intermediate descriptions, the dtilling, the trade was slow, with a ,downward tendency in prioe, but grinding parcels, which appeated to be muwh grown. were decidedly ls cheaper. Beet barley, for malt, realized from 46;. to 60s. distIlg lii. to 43g; und grinding, 32SA to lie.

On the same day, at High Wycombe, there was little business at reduced prices.
ROCEMSTER, FP. 2L
With a return of fine open weather farming work in this dittict i
proceeding, anda great deal of spring-sown wheat wil have been got in. The wheat plauts are everywhere looking exceedingly promising. A great many samples of wheat tiUl continue to oome to hand iu very inferior condition, the close state of the atmosphere seriously affecting the grain.
The corn trade at this market wwa extremely inactive, and altbough there was an average number of samples on offer the trade was duil, farmers being evidently desirous of holding their stocks in expectation of an improvement in the oondition of the grain. Afew good samples maintained last week's priceas but in other sorts where sales wero forced there was a slight decline. The trade in barley was slow, anl the sles lmited at former currencies. Matting barley had bht few inquirere, Oats were almost neglected, and no improTement in price can be noted. The market closed with a downward tendency, the following being the quotations:-White wheat, 609g to 63g.; red ditto, AU to .n6; malting barley, 42, to 46g; grinding ditto, Ide. to 391. oats, 21L to 24g.

MAIDSTONE, FEB. 2L OFE1cIu DECLAR.ATION OF THLE POLL.
The official declaration by the High Sheriff of the numbers polled for the respective candidates, Mr. Wykeham Martin and Sir W. B. ]iddell, at the late election took place to-day. Notwithstanding the prohibition by the law of the exhibition of colours and music, the friends of Mr. Martin, the successful candidate, sported pretty extensively the blue rosettes, the emblem of the Liberal party, and a band of mnsic was also in attendance. A number of the tenants of Mr. Mlartin proceeded on horseback to meet him on the road to Maidstone, and they escorted him to the hustings. Sir Walter Riddell, the defeated candidate, left Maidstone on Friday, and not a single supporter of that gentleman made his appearance on the husting3 or took any part in the proceedings to-day.
At 1 o'clock, the hour a ppointed for the declaration of the poll to be made, Lz. J. tsavage, the High bberifi came forward and said that he had to announce to the electors that the numbers polled at this election were, for
Mr. Martin... ... ... ... 3,5a5 Sir W. Riddell . .. ... ... 3,149
Majority for Mx. Martin ;.. ... 408
It was therefore his duty to declare that Charles W7keharn Lartin, Esq., had been duly returned as a knight to represent this division of the shire in Parliament. (Great cheering.)
The above numbers were made up from the foUowing returns from the different polling districts:-

Mr. MxARTur, baving undergone the ceremony of being
"girt with a sword," stood forward, amid the most enthu. sastic cheering, to return thanks for his being elected. He said he embraced the first moment to return his most grateful and cordial thanks for the high honour that had been conferred on him-an honour the highest that an English "ommoner could aspire to-that of representing an important British county in the most important assembly in the world. (Cheers.) He most earnestly thanked those electors who had conterred this high mark of distinction on him, and he also most cordiaUy thanked his opponents, for, although he had fought no less than six contested elections, he had never on any occasion seen an election conducted with mure courtesy, more kindness, and more mutual good. feeling than had been manifested on the present occasion. (Cheers.) He considered the trust they had reposed in him one of the highest importance, and the verdict they had given 'was one that he hoped would be known and responded to throughout the length and breadth of the land. It was a verdict in favour of principles to which he attachedvery great importance, and to which they had now given their ratification. (Cheers.) The electors had pronounced in favour of the glorious principle of civil and religious liberty; they had declared that no man should be debarred from any of the rights of citizenship on account of his religion; they had given their verdict in favour of liberty of conscience to the Dissenting population of the nation; they had given their verdict in favour of a sound and judicious extension of the franchise; they had pronounced in favour of an extended system of edacation, to embrace, if possible, the humblest of their fellow-sabject,; and they had pornounced in favonr of that principle of reform in all our different departments and institutions, which, when coupled with edacation and the principle that merit should bave a fair chance, would give to erery nun who possessed integrity and moral principle a chance of obtaining any or all of the great prizes in the lottery of life. (Cheers.) Now that the election was terminated he trusted that if any feelings of rancour or disappointment esisted in any quarter they vould be laid aside, and that if any were offended at the manner in whichavotehad been given on one side or the other those who entertained such a feeling would confess, on reflection, that the vote was not given to an elector for any personal purpose, as a ready mode of returning an old obhgation, orto please his laudlord, or to the tradesmen to please his customers; but that it was given to him for the purpose of promoting the public weal. (Cheers.) He knew of many instances where these plinciples had not been carried out as they should be, but he also knew instanceswherethey had been respected by persons in every station of life. They had been respected by landlords who declined to influence their tenants, aud he was thankfunl to say that they had been evinced by tenants who had p9sitively refused to vote in accordance with the wish of their landlord when those wishes did not coincide with their own feelings of duty and right, (Cheers.) After some furtber observations Mr. Martin concluded by again thanking the electors for the honour they had conferred upon him, and said he should devote ail his energies in Parliament, not only to the nse of his supporters alone, but to the use of his opponents and every inhabitant of the great county which had returned hbin as its representative. (Cheers.)
The proceedings of the election then terminated with a resolution of thanks to the Eigh Sheril, and the electors
ereyarated. ____________

(FCB OUR OWN OORRMPOWDZxT.)
DUBLIN, SATURDAY lMOINMfG.
The worshippers of an Irish Court were cast down last week into the very depths of despair by the prevalence of a rumour to the effect that the abolition of the Viceroyalty was likely ere long to form the subject of Cabinet contemplation. Happily for the alarmed, the occasion of the Lord Mayor's inaugural banquet furnished an opportunity of dispersing the cloud which lowered over the vicereeai horizon, and Cork-hill and the Castle again 1kk bright and cheerful. Lord Carlisle himself was the herald of the gladsome tidings that the reported dissohition cf the Court was without any solid basis. Here are his ipsis6-im7u reerba:
'There is (said his Excellency) one other motive dightly more personal to myself which causes me eagerly to appreciate the kindness with which you have reoeived me this evening, for I perceive that there are quarters from which I, in common, mideed, with all the future Lords-Lieutenant of Ireland, have been threatened with a deposition from my present viceregal seat. I certainly have received no official ntimation on that subject. ("Hear, hear," and chees ) Our gracious Sovereign has not made me privy to any intention of depriving me of that delecated authority which I so unworthily wiela in her name (cries of " No, no"); and I cannot pretend to say that I have read my doom in the countenanoes or demeanour of the Irish people (loud cheers), or even in that of this brilliant assembl ; and therefore we will only conclude that the question, in Parliamentary parlance, has been indefinitely adjourned." (Cheers and
XXTAORDINARY MAJaTAG E CASE.
The remarkable case of " Beatnish v. Beamish," involvinz the question " Can a clergyman marry himself 1" was called on for judgment yeeterday before 11 of the 12 judges sitting in error. Baron Pennefather was absent. Subjoined is an outline of the matter at issue
"The appeal proceedings were instituted by the defendant to set aside the unanimous decision of the Court below (consisting of Judges Crampton, Perrin, and Moore), by which a marriage solemnized under such circumstances was held to be valid in law. It appeared that this case came before the Court below upon a special verdict finding that the plaintiff, Albert S. Beamish, a minor, brought an ejectment upon the title to recover certain lands in the county of Cork, of considerable value, which he claimed to be entitled to as andson and heir-at-law of the late Dr. John S. Beamish, ofCork. The defendant denied the legitimacy of the plaintiff, and also claimed as heir-at-law of Dr. Bemish, his father. The special verdict stated that the late Dr. John S. Bemiwsh in his lifetime seised of considerable estates in fee simple and died so seised on the 16th of December, 1852; that he had several sons, and that the eldest was the Rev. Samuel S. Beamish, the defendant being that rev. gentleman's next brother. The Rev. Mr. Beamish was duly ordained a clergyman of the united churches of England and Ireland, and it appeared that on the 27th of November, 1831, being then in holy orders, he went to the house of a milliner named Anne Lyons, in the city of Cork, and there performed a ceremony of marriage between himself and a young woman named Isabella Frazer, the mother of the minor plaintiff, The special verdict then set out the manner in which the ceremony of marriage took place, and alleged that the general form for the solemnization of that ceremony prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer of the united churches of England and Ireland was used, tho Rev. Mr. Beamish declaring that he took the said IsabellaFrazer to be his wedded wife, and she declaring that she took him to be her wedded husband. It further appeared that a wedding-ring was placed upon the finger of Isabella Fraser by the Eev. Mr.
eamish, and the usual blessing pronounced; and that after the ceremony the marriage was consummated between the contracting parties. No clergyman was present at the performance of the ceremony except the Rev. Mr. Beainish himself, nor was there, in fact, any one present as a formal witness in the room where this ceremony took place; but, as the special verdict alleged, the performance of the ceremony was witnessed by a woman named Catherine Coffey who, without the knowledge of the contracting parties, and solely from curiosity, saw it going on througha 'window from an adjoining back yard, but did not hear what was said by either party. Isabella Frazer was admittedly a member of the church of England. It farther appeared that the Rev. Mr. Beamish, who thus celebrated this marriage between himself and Isabella Frazer, died intestate on the 8th of April, 1844; and that the minor plaintiff washis eldest son, and the issee of that marriage, born on the 4th of January, 184L Upon the foregoing very peculiar state of facts, the questions raised were,-1st. Had there been at the ceremony in question words of present contract by which the Rev. S. S. Beamish and Isabella Frazer engaged to become husband and wife? 2d. Had there been a marriage cereu ony prformed according to the forms prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer? 3d Was the mariage so solemnized consummated between the parties ? 4th. What was the effect of the marriage ceremony, thete being no other clergyman present ?And,lastly, whether, althoughthere was no witness regularlypresent, thefactsstated inreferenceto Catherine Coffey constituted her a witness ? As previously stated, the Court of Queen's Bench (in the absence of the Lord Chief Justice from indisposition), after a very ful argument of the case, held that a valid, although an irregular and clandestine, marriage had been solemnized between the parties upon the authority of the case of ' Maxwell v. Maxwell,' and various other cases decided both in England and Ireland. Upon the argum ent in the court below it was contended, on the part of the defendant, that no Court should uphold such a mnarriage, and that if marriages in the absence of witnesses were to be upheld as legal great injury to the public would arise; while, on the pa of the minor, it was argued that it would be a gross injustice to him to set aside the marriage and thereby pronoance him ilUegitimate, and deprive him of a large property to which he would otherwise be entitled, as the eldest son of his father.
"As the judges differed in opion, they necessarily pronounced separate judgments, Mr. Justice Keogh (the junior judge) commencing, as usual in such cases."
Judge Keogh, Baron Greene, Judge Jackson, and Judge Ball gave judgment against the marriage. Baron Richards, Judge Perrin, Judge Moore, and Judge Crampton were in favour of sustaining the judgment of the Court below. The Court then adjourned to this morning, when the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and the Lord Chief Baron will deliver their opinions. It is rumoured that two of their Lordships are for confirming, the judgment of the Court below, and one against it. Should this be the case there will be six judges in favour of the marriage and five against it, so that the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench will be confirmed by a majority of one.
The Queen's Colleges In Ireland.-Reports
TEsE QuiExi's COLLEGFS TN IRELAM D.-Reporbs of the Presidents of the Qaeen's Colleges of Galway and Belf6st have just been published and presented to Parliament by command of tho Qnees. At Belfast the number of students in the session of 1855.56 amounted to 193. Their snecess in competing with the students of other universities and colleges for public appointments is quoted as a proof of the excellent instruction imparted in this college. The principle of mixed education is flUy sustained, and the professors of all creeds receive together in the same halls 'the advantages of an education " such as expanding science and
the advancing age require, amid the existence of perfect I harmony and a generous feeling pervading the whole body of the students." In the last session 33 students belonged to the established clurch, and 106 to the General Assembly, 16 were non-subscribing Presbyterians,19 Romanists and the rest Dissenters of various sects and persuasions. Those of the General Assembly are in a large majority. At the College of Galway, in the sessionn of 1856-57, 41 students entered, inc ding 21 Romanists, 15 members of the establshed church, and 5 Presbvterians, &c. The total number entered since 1849-50 is 30e, including 155 Romanists, 116 of the established church, and 34 Presbyterians, &c, In 1855-56 the foUowing lectures were attended bv the following number of students viz. :-Greek, 21 ; Latin; 20; mathematics, 25;- English, &cs., 22 ; modern languages, 290; Celtic, inone (and only three inxthe cours of seven sesious); natural philosophy, 21 ; natural history, 30 ; logic, &c., 13 ; chymistry, 19; geology and mineralogy, 10; engineering, 9; agriculture, 7; anatomy and physiology, 22; ,nackria mediea, 8 ; surgery, 0; midwifery, 4; medicine, 6; English law, 5 ; and jurisprudence, political economy, &c., 9. These colleges, and more especialy tho CoUege of Galway, have to contend with certain obstacles which are pointed out in his report by Mr. E. Berwick, the president of the latter college. They include the want of residence halls, the want of preparatory schools, and, above all, the preposterously extensive character of the curriculum required by the Queen's University in Ireland from all who go for the degree of A..B. That of Dublin University was deeinadlaiready so extensive by the commis sioners appointed to inquire into the matter that they de clined to recommend any addition to it beyond the introduction of one modern language. N4ow, the "additional" subjects compulsory in Trinity Colege include etbics alone whereas in the Queen's Colleges they include no less thau nine, such as natural history, chymistry, English language and literature, a modern language, history and metaphysics, or jurisprudence and political economy. In short, 14 subects are required for a degree in the Queen's University, but only six in Trinity College. The intelligent author of the report before us recommends for the colleges (especiaUy for Galway) the establishment of haUs of resideuce, the foundation of intermediate classical schools, and a modification of the present monstrous cunrrictluum in the Faculty of Arts. Pending the application of these remedies the beneficial operation of the colleges u-ill be sadly limited.
"T TE GOOD OLD TIMES !"-There is now living in Epperstone, Notts, an octogenarian wbo has been blind for several years from the effects of an accident. He says that when ho was a child white bread was considered a great luxury, so much so that when his father (who was a framework-knitter) used to take his work to Nottingham he would frequently promise to bring the children a. white penny-loat each on his return, and such was the anxiety of the lttle ones to possess the luxury that they have many times gone the distance of three or four miles to meet their father, in order that they might have it a little tooner, and this in depth of winter, in frost and snow.

VAsAINT OCIILDREN AID INDUrSRIAL SCHOOLS. -A Bill of Sir S. Northcote, Mr. Adderley, and Mr. Headlam empowers the police to lay hands on vagrant, destitute, and mendicantchildrun, and detain them in the workhouse for 48 hours pcnding an inquiry. They will then be taken before a justice of the peace, who may reouire security for the proper care and behaviour of the childien for 12 months. and in default thereof may commit the children for a certain period to a certified industrial school, regard being had to any preference for one school over another manifested by the parents. Chbidren offending against the PoHce Act may be dealt with in a similar manner, instead of being sent to prison. The children of notorious thieves, &c., maybe sent to a reformatory, instead of an industrial school. The children may be discharged from school when thejustices are satisfied that suitable employment is provided for them, or on good security being found. No child may be detainedbeyondtheage of 15years. Theuntion wherein the vagrant children are found must pay 3s. a-week to the managers of the scbool for their maintenance, butbhe guardians, on the other hand, may summon thAe parents to show cause why they should not paf theumslves according to their ability.

LONYDONY, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1857.
We have often had to regret the tendency of the House of Commons to throw away in an hour the fruits of many years' savings. For the mere purpose of buying off the opposition of a class, conciliating a party, or extrieating itself from a political difficulty, it thinks nothing of a vote which virtually adds millions to the mass of national obligations. The tendency has increased of late years, and all parties, all statesmnen, are answerable for it. This, however, is not the time to investigate the evil, and to-day the House of Commons has to consider, not what it ought to have done last year, or during the last five or ten years, but what it ought to do now. That is the real question, and if the House of Commons has deliberately fixed on the nation a number of charges incapable of reduction, and requiring an Act of Parliament for their removal, we have only to provide for them as well as we can. So, though ourinances are not in so agreeable a state to-day as they were five years ago, and though the genius of financial castlebuilding, which then indulged in long vistas of increasing revenue and declining expenditure, has received great discouragement, stillthetaskofthefinancier is not necessarily so vast, so boundless, so universal as his foes or his rivals would be happy to make it for him. Sir G. COiumxWALL LEwlS has not to adjust revenue and expenditure for ever and for aye; he has not to guarantee those reductions which in the course of the next three years the House of Commons may perhaps have the opportunity of making at its leisure; he has not to lay down any grand principles or reverse any policy. He has not done, or attempted, any of these things. Charged with the simple duty of restoring our finances to something like symmnetry and hopefulness, after a costly war, he has concentrated his attention, as we think with good sense, on the other disposable and manageable parts of the materials before him. Public attention, always beforehand with Chancellors of the Exchequer, had already marked out the particular subjects for review. The War Ninepence and the war taxes raised chiefly by suspending the declining scales of duty on tea and sugar, and a duty on spirits, were the parts of the revenue affected by the war, and affected therefore by the peace. Everybody thought of them at once, and any Chancellor of the Exchequer would have had to
give reasons for any course whatever he might take with regard to them, certainly for taking no course at all, if he could have done so. The parts of the expenditure obtruding themselves on his survey are more extensive, but still confined within narrower limits than most people imagine. Many Ohancellors of the Exchequer have had to remind the public of the very small area within which it was possible to economize. The war has vastly expanded this area, but still it does not include charges fixed by Act of Parliament. It extends to the Estimates for the Arny, Navy, Civil and Miscellaneous Services, under all of which heads there are many large items which scarcely admit of alteration from one year to another. In saying that Sir GEonRoB C. Lxwis has confined his attention to the most natural and most proper materials for re-arrangement we mean more than an empty compliment. Several taxes had been pressed upon him for repeal, and in the new fashion he might have felt aa ambition to deal with them at least prospectively. But he has touched only those portions of our finances affected by the war. He has not gone out of his way for favour or for fame, or for that love of invention, which is even a stronger motive with financiers. We do not remember a less pretentious, that is, a less ambitious, or less gratuitous Budget; and the best supposition we can make as to the intentions of the framer is that his first consideration wasWhat must I deal with I And his second-How must I deal with it?
With these qualities, as it appears to us, patent and undeniable on the very face of the Budget, we could not have imagined it possible that any Xman, not even ono gifted with the volubility and expansion ascribed to some Transatlantic orators, could have made it the subject of go prodigious a
philippic as Mr. GLAMSTONS'S. We know -tho fecundity of that gentleman's argumentative talent; we know the infinite variety of topics with which he can adorn the most simple material; we knov his pausion for figures. More than this, we know-who does not know ?-the feelings of rival financiers. Whatever may be said against the " loves of the triangles," there is no denying hatreds to arithmetic. Yet we must pronounce Mi. GLADSTONES speech on Friday as a perfectly incomparable specimen of the vituperative class. The only parallel that occurs to us is that famous speech of Mr. O'Co.xras, addressed not to the House of Commons, or to a monster meeting, but to an elderly market-woman n whom he finished by calling an hypothenuse. One cannot but admire the art with which so magnificent a fabric can be constructed out of such a handful of raw material. A pound of cotton can be spun so fine as to reach, for aught we know, from here to the moon; and a pound of steel converted into hairsprings is worth 5,0001. But what are these prodigies of art compared with an oration quite as terrible and voluminous a3 those of CiEoo against VEBnEs, or BUnKE against WAR n sHAsrTNos, against a modest plau for arranging the decline of three war taxes during three years ? Yes, gentlemen, you see this Budget of raw material. Take it in your hands. Feel how light it is. Here are three taxes which in the piping times of peace were fixed to ddcline gradually, one to nothing, the others to a moderate fixity in 1860. The war compelled us to put off this intended decline. When the war was over we had to think what was to be done. On the one hand, the war. was over; on the other, it had increased our expenses, both permanent and temporary. Here, then, was the question. It has been settled by keeping to the original period of 1860, but making the decline not quite so rapid. Such is the handful of matter. There is hardly enough in it for a leading article, or even a short paragraph. But you shall see what is made of it by an artist from Oxford. He will make out that the modest author of this simple arrangement has subverted a splendid policy-has doomed his country to ruin three years hence-has insulted the memories of our greatest statesnen, and thrown contempt on the blessings of HEAVEN -has pandered to the selfishness of the British artistocracy at the expense of the whole tea and sugar consuming population of this country-has palmed off a gross illusion on the weak mind of Parliament-has betrayed the most presumptuous confidence in the national resources, and at the same time the grossest want of courage in his calculation of its future expenditure. Indeed, it is scarcely possible to say what Mr. GIADsToxn has not made out of this handful. The conjuror can put an egg into his hat and bring out flocks of pigeons, geese, and turkeys; but that feat is nothing comnpared with Mr. GItDSTOii'S speech on his " right hon. friend's" Budget.
We have done our very best to winnow the speech, and separate the chaff from the wheat; but the result has so often disappointed the utmost straining of our visual powers that even now we fear we cannot tell the real drift of the speech. As fast as we put one construction upon it a contrary one presents itself. The speech is a series of dissolving views, in which Mr. GLADSTONE first
exhibits his " friend " as the stingy financier, pretending that he has made reductions which he has not, and fastening burdens upon us which he need not have done. Then he is the improvident financier, flinging away the national resources, booking us all for Bankruptcy, and robbing England of her character for financial honesty. Then he is the audacious financier, venturing to look three years in advance, which Mr. GLuATONE:, of course, has never done, or done only to have all his anticipations success, " bt "for the war." Then he is the timid financier, who will not tell us exactly and confidently how we shall stand in 1860, when the comet will come, when the Millennium, and so forth. A turn of the machine then presents us with a view of Naval and Military Magazines bursting with stores; another exhibits us all ruined with the cost of more powder blazed away on the Chinese. In this way Mr. GIADSTONE rides and ties with at least a score conflicting objections, like travellers crossing the Pampas, who can only ride each one horse at a time, but drive ten times as many before them. There certainly are not less than twenty argumentative reliefs in the speech, not one of which will bear juxtaposition with its neighbours. The power of utterance and the fluency of language that could so occupy the mind of the House with each successive topic as to make it forget the one before it is, no doubt, a wonderful accomplishment in this country, which certainly has more sense than expression. But we shall wonder still more if, on full deliberation, the British public really believe that they are about to pay this year as heavy taxes as the last, that at the same time they have compromised their credit, that Sir G. CoBaEwALL Lnws is answerable for all the increased expenditure caused by the war or fixed by Acts of the Legislature, but yet has no hand in the reduction of taxes; that he is an oppressor for every penny he keeps on, and a spendthrift for every penny he takes off; and has at once tied the hands of Parliament for ever so many years, and left it rather too much to do next year, the year after, and the next after that.
As far as principles go there seems to be no
As far as principles go there seems to be no great difference of opinion on the question of the Estimates, which are so soon to be fiercely debated in detail. It is agreed on all sides that while the standard of the last two years is to be entirely given up, and a mcale of peace expenditure revived, it will be desirable, nevertheless, to turn the lessons of our late campaigns to good account in improving the organization and equipment of our forces. At this stage of the argument, however, the debatable points of the question begin to show themselves, and subjects of inquiry and controversy presently occur. What are these objects to 'which our measures of improvement should be directed, and on which it may be prudent to expend money and pains? Putting the question as precisely as possible, what is it advisable to do now beyond what was done, say, in 1853, the year representing the last year of peace ?
We should be disposed to place in the fiint rank a very broad and comprehensive deduction from the lessons of the last three years; nothing short, indeed, of this-that not only is European war among the number of possible contingencies, but that we may find ourselves "drifting" into the vortex almost insensibly, and certainly in despite of our utmost efforts to the contrary. So long had peace subsisted, and so menacing had been the differences between States, which nevertheless had been terminated, time after time, without positive collision, that the revival of actual hostilities between any of the great Powers of Europe seemed a thing scarcely within the range of calculation. We have now seen, however, that the event may reaUy occur, and that our preparations should be measured by a practical standard. We may need not only soldiers, but an amy-not only regiments, but all those numerous appliances by which an aggregate of regiments is enabled to take the field in a state of efficiency and vigour. One more lesson, too,-very general in its purport,-may also be remembered-viz., that it is cheaper, as well as better, to make such prepara-
tions in good time, and not to leave them to be extemporized in the straits of an emergency.
Descending now to details, and taking the Army first, it may certainly be assumed that we do not want a greater number of troops now than in 1853, unless in so far as it may be desirable to increase the strength of those special corps which cannot, like regiments of the Line, be augmented at discretion, but which require long and careful training. We are here speaking of the Artillery mnd Engineers, to which arms of the service we must now add others of equally special utility, and the want of which became so painfully evident during the war. TTnder some name or other-that of a Military Train or a Land Transport Corps-we oug,ht to possess an effective and well-organized body of men, qualified by training and equipment to conduct the supplies of the Army and to insure its subsistence wherever it may be acting. By some means or other, too, the Hospital Department should be improved, and measures should be taken in good earnest for encountering. those casualties of active service which are always much more destructive than the sword. These, it appears to us, are the chief, if not the only, points on which any atual expansion of our system is required; and if the special corps are maintained in efficiency and such a character imparted to the service in general that the Army, while well trained itself, may admit of ready augmentation when necessity arises, we think the suggestions of prudence would be -satisfied. It would hardly be necessary to keep a single additional " soldier," in the ordinary sense in which that word is used.
How, then, are these general aids to be insUred? How is the Army to be well trained and the popularity of the service to be secured? The answer is very obvious ;-in the one case by good instruction and good equipment; in the other by continued attention to the condition of the soldier. The expense entailed under these heads, though not in itself very large, would be appreciable in a comparison of Estimates. The camps at Aldershott and elsewhere, the School of blusketry at Hythe, the manufactories for the new rffle, and other similar establishments, are such as would provoke few objections, but they must each add their quota to the expenditure of the year. Then, again, there is the improvement in the clothng and physical comfort of the troops, to which Mr. Gn.&DsToNz alluded in terms of approval on the first night of the session, and some extension, also, of barrack accommodation, suggested by plain experience. The provision, in short, requiredlin theserespects divides itself under two general heads. There is, first of all, that natural current of reform and improvement which is sure to be found in a coianitry like ours, and which would elevate the position of the individual soldier at some additional expense to the State. This increase of cost would have occurred independently of the war; in fact, it was discernible in the Estimates year after year before the war began. Then come the lessons learnt in actual campaigning, and for the benefit of these we begin to pay now. Great, however, and substantial as are the advantages to be thus derived, their- cost need not be large in comparison with the masa of our expenditure on such purposes. In the present year the demand is heavier than it would otherwise be, owing to the expense of first establishments and the arrears of war contracts, but after the improved machinery has been set going the current excess of outlay over that of former years would probably be smalL
In the case of the Navy the room for exp&nsion is considerably less; indeed, it appears to resolve itself mainly into the substitutionl of steam power for sailing power. This change, however, is very costly, and, if we had not fortunately made great progress in the work, the prospect before us would be truly formidable. It is estimated that a line-of-battle ship fitted with steam machinery costs 33 per cent. more in building than the same vessel when built for sailing only. Nor does the additional expense stop even here, for the excess of cost continues at exactly the same rate in keeping her up. Not only are there the steady consumption of coals and the wear and tear of engines to be provided for, but the docks and apparatus required for repairs are all on an expensive scale. The necessity of small craft as well as large in the constitution of an effective navy we have recently seen, but here also the cost has already been incurred, and we have little to do beyond keeping our gunboats, &c., in good order. Another point of great importance is the supply of able and well-trained seamen, and we trust that the measiures successively adopted for satisfying the required conditions in this respect have at length proved effectual. The improvements thus introduced it is of course desirable to maintain, nor would they involve any great expenditure. In the Estimates of the present year a certain portion of the excess over years preceding the war is due to the general dearness of provisions, which increases, of course, the charge for victualling the Navy, while the precautions taken to insure a supply of seamen find an expression in the augmented charge for the Coastguard Servicea force looked upon as containing a naval reserve. That the corps of Royal Marines should be maintained in good strength and thorough efficiency is what we need hardly be at the pains of proving by argument, considering the well-known usefulness of the force.
Now, as many of the arrangements above-mentioned have been already effected, or at all events so far effected that the foundations lie ready for a good superstructure, it would be mere waste to demolish what experience has shown us would surely be wanted, and what, when emergencies arose, we should simply have to construct anew at greater cost and with greater difficulty. It is by availing ourselves, in short, of these preparations that we shall be utilizing the outlay as well as the lessons arising from the war. We do not want large forces, but simply the means for raising large forces when wanted. We require an effective strength in those special arms which tell so powerfully and which admit so little of being extemporized, and a good nucleus in the other cases, round which a strong force could be rapidly and effectually mustered. These, we think, are "the real necessities of the
" country," and we trust that as they can be satisfied by an expenditure moderate even when measured by the standard of peace, they wiiU not be saerificed to the exigencies either of Mr GLADSTO.NE or of AIr. DISRAELI
The LORD MAYOR has been playing the part of
The LOBD MLAYOR. has been playing the part of flARo"N ALRAsCIH in a manner deserving of all praise. If, instead of receiving accounts at secondhand,people who have direct influence on the oonduct of affairs would more frequently wander about incogniti, they would obtain information of a kind with which they cannot be supplied by others. It is one thing, for example, to read in a police report that a pauper has been rejected from a casual ward, and quite another to witness the scene of his rejection. Who can properly describe upon paper the squalid misery of the poor wretch who is gent away at night faint and weary from the inhospitable gate of the asylum in which he had hoped to find at lemst that small quanztun of food and shelter which would keep life and soul together until morning ? Who can adequately supply the horror and indignation which such a spectacle is calculated to inspire ? It should be added that persons occupying official positions Iare peculiarly subject to deception. It seems to
be an alrost unavoidable incident of their position that they regard with distrust and suspicion ny account which does not come to them through a strictly official channel. A tale of ill-usage must pass through half-a-dozen mouths, all more or less interested in qualifying it and colouring it, before it reaches their ears. For them truth is always " cooked." The LOiD M&Yon has had the sense to perceive this, and the spirit to act upon his impression. He appears to have become aware of the fact that, especiaUy at this season of the year, great hardship is endured by the unfortunate creatures who are driven by PoverWs hard stress to make application for temporary assistance at the doors of the London work-. houses, and accordingly, in company with the RECORDER, Mr. Under-Sheriff ANDERToN, aud Mfr. BUNXLNG, the City Architect, he resolved one evening to visit the West London Union Workhouse, when his presence was least expected, and to satisfy himself as to the condition of the Casual Ward above all things. So said, and so done. The dignitaries arrived at the workhouse, not without some little astonishment upon the part of the officials at the unexpected visitation. There is no mention made of the result as far as the preliminary ceremony was concerned, for it was merely preliminary to the real object of the visit. " But where is the " Casual Ward i" was the firt inquiry. " The " Casual Warl ? Oh, ah, yes-the Casual Ward "is not here." " Where is it, then I" " Why, "at Battle-bridge, two miles and a-half from "here." This was a pretty state of things to begin with, even if it should turn out, upon inspection, that the Casual Ward at Battle-bridge was all that could be desired. The mere fact that the Casual Ward was at such a ditance from the actual workhouse implied that the poor creatures who might apply for a night's shelter sometinmes late in the night, and in the last degree of exhaustion from huager, fatigue, and sickness of heart, were compelled, after they had passed the ordeal of inspection and received their tickets of admission, to set out ipoln 2 fresh pilgrimage througlh the streets of London before they reached the spot where they might hope to rest their weary lmbs, with ther prospect of a crust of bread or of a modinur of gruel in the mor.ing. Still, ad the Casual Pauper's refuge, when he reached it at blt, been such a place as was fit for the reception of a human being, therr would have beent the les to be said but mark the result.
The Lostu MAYOr. and IRcoonmr, as soon as they had reseived the information, dlrove off to Battle-bridge. They found the Casual Ward of the West Londbn Union, and what buiing do our readers suppose had been selected for the purpose ? It was a stable-a twelve-stal stble. This, in the opinoDn of the parish authorities, was the best lodging they could contrive for the casual poor essistently with' the diseharge of their duties to the ratepayers. Now, we are not of those who require for the Casual Poor such accommodation as a foreign Prince night meet with at MivAinr's or the Clarendon. We are well aware that precautions must be taken not to make the houses of reception for the casual poor luxurious, or even too comfortable. The immediate consequence, of course, would be that every idle vagabond in London would give up all thought of providing for his own subsistence, and; knock nightly at the door of one or- other of' those institutions, in which he wouli be sure of food and shelter- of a very satisftsctory kind without any trouble tupon his own part. There is, however, reason, in all things, Whatever opinion may be entertained of the further suggestions we are aboii to offer, there can be xo. doubt that every Casual Ward in London should be sufficiently Iorge, and reasonably well warmed and ventilated, a-d that there should be a distinction between thewomen's ward and theward for-the men. This is a meAter of first principle, upon which there cen be no ejsestion. At least let not the- men and women be promiscuously liftered down together; at least let the-wards, however homely and rough they may be, not be exaggeratiGns of the wosut style of penny lodging-houses. Bubto go further. The usual reason assigned why some kind of bedding is not provided fer these wretched creatures i*s that they most commonly present themselves in such a state of indescribable filtb, andi that they are, so overrutt with verman, that there would be a danir necessity for renewing the beddin& or, at least, fer purifying it, at a great outlay of trouble and ePpense. In recommending to the ncAdce of the Lomdon parishes a plan. aiopted generally, we believe,, in the Irish workhomses, we are not offering any recommendation of our own, nor do we assumne to be making any ve7y novel suggestion. It is the custom, we are told, in Ireland, when paupers present themselvesfor admission to the workhouses, to compel them to undergo a purification of hot water, and while they are undergoing this process the clothes. of which they have been stripped are flung into&an oven, which is rmaintained at such a heat that nothing living may pass through it and retain life. This, of course, 3makes an end of the vermin. L t it not be supposed that the prospect of this purification is at all delightful to its intended recipients; on the contrary, they generaEly look forward to it with intense disgust, and look back upon it with horror. Sir FNrCIs HEAX', in his Notes tmpon Ireland, if we remember right, mentions that many of the Irish paupers complained most bitterly after their discharge of the foul treatment they had undergone in the Bastiles. Anything but the soap and water they could have endured. Since their enforced purification they had never known what warmth or comfort maeant. It would require years to renew that thick paletot of dirt of which they had been so foauly bereft by the Poor Law officials. It was the growth of years, and five minutes had been sufficient to annihilate it. Now, hot water is not expensive. It does not cost much to keep a fire alive to heat an oven. The wages of the man and woman who must be hired to preside over the compulsory ablutions would not be a very serious matter.
In the statement we have given of the condition in which the Casual Ward of the West London lUnion at Battle-bridge was found by the city dignitaries there is nothing exaggerated. Here is a slight addition, which
we copy rerbatiin from the report of their proceedingsr:-" The poor creatures, in answer to inquiries "made of them, stated that upon entering t1he build"ing a small portion of bread had been given them, "but that it was the custom to turn them out "in the morning without anything to eat unless "they first broke a quantity of stones, of which "there was a large heap in the yard. The LoRD "MAyOR and his friends next entered an adjoining
cattle-shed, where they found two destitute "women huddled together on a rug, lying on tbe "bare ground, almost perished with cold, and "withouit either fire or food." When they had concluded their inspection the party of visitors went off to the City Gaol, at Holloway, where they found 455 prisoners, well lodged in separate apartments, wvith plenty of bedding, blankets, and comforts of every kind. Well might the LoRD MAYon say, " If the poor were treated in such a "way as that, was it not natural that they should " resort to crime rather than submit to it I"

Death Of The Earl Of Harewood.
DEATH OF THE EARL OF HABE WooDO
(BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPI.)
The unfavourable character of the medical bulletin issued from Harewood-house on Friday morning last will in some measure have prepared the public to expect this event. His Lordship died yesterday (Sunday) morning at 3 o'clock, at his country residence, Harewood-house, near Leeds, 28 days and a-half after suffering A fracture of the skull and other injuries from his horse falling while his Lordship was following the Bramham-moor foxhounds. His Lordship, who for many years had been noted as a careful rider, was passing through an opening in a hedge which separated two fields, and, not observing a sheep net that was affixed to the bottom of the opening, the hind feet and legs of the horse became entangled in the net, the anmal was thrown down, anm in its struggles to get free it kicked or struck. him on the head, inflicting a compound fractureof the skull. Immediately after the accident, medical and surgical assistance was procured, and although the worst results were apprehended frora the first his Lordship progressed favourably for three weeks. The Countess of Harewood, the sons and the daughters of the noble Earl, and other near kindred of his Lordship, were present when his Lordship expired.
.The late Earl was an excellent landlord, and did much to promote the moral, social, intelleetul, asd religious interests of his humbler fellowbeings by encouraging and supporting scheols, mechanics' institultes, and churches. The deceased,
Henry Lascelles, the third Earl of Harewood, was born on the 11th of June, 1797, and was, therefor, at the time of his death, in the 60th year of his age. Ile married in July, 1823, IAdy Louisa Thynne, second daughter of the second Marquis of Bath. Her Ladyship and a large family of sons and daughters survive hin. the noble Earl was ed,,cated at Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the army before he wa5 1S years of age, having obtained an ensigncy in the Grenadier Gnards, in APil, 1814. He was in the battle of Waterloo, and was slightly wounded there. IHe retired on half-pay in 120, and from the standing aray in 1831; but, while he was on half-pay, and for several years afterwards, he held a commi8sion i3n the Yeomanry Cavalry Corps, called the Yorkshire Hussars, fromr 1826 to 1831. The late Earl, as the Hon. MIr. Lascelles, represented the borough cl Northallerton for some years in Parlia-
went. lUe was a Conservative in politics. His Lordship succeeded to the Earldorn on the death of his father, the second Earl of Harewood, at the--sose of 1811, and was appointec Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding on the death of Lord Wharncliffe, in 1846. It is somewhat singTlar that the deaths of the last two Earls of Harewood were both connected Wmth followinu foxhounds; the one died at the age ofT3 years, fiuro natural ca w'es-he was retuniig to Harewooda Hose after hunting; and. the death of the other was eaused under the circnmstances mewtioned above.
The latter Earl had twee previously narrowly escmped serions injury or- death. IN the battle of Waterloo he was carried off his legs by the bursting of a shell, but suffered no permanent injury; and about sin years after that he was dhooting seafoed off Cowes, Isle of WiVigt, when a gan burst in. his hands, and did erious injury to three other persons, but little or none to his Lorlship. The noble' & lis suceeeded by his eldest son, Henry ThYnne Y--count Lascelles, who was born in 1824~ and married, in 1845 Lady Elizabeth Joanne, eldest dawghter of the present Marquis of Clanricarde. Her Ladyship died. in 1854 leaving several children. The present ELf is now a widower. Of the other children of the deceased Earl, the Hon. Geerge Edwin LaseeDIes is married to the daughter of the Earl of Mansfield; the Hon. and Rev. James Walter Lasoulles is married to the daughter of M4r. W. Miles,

Congress had rejected the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty by recommitting it to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Various statements are given as to the *extent of the majority. The Nevw York JTournlw of Commerce says:-
" The cause of its rejection is not clear, as the Senate has -snly acted on it in secret session. The South, whose leass -conservativism is expremsed in Southera matters than the North, seems in the debate, however, to have been the most -conservative. Mr. Mason, of Virginia, strongly advocated the treaty as it is, and was supported by a few Southern Conuservative senators, Butler, Evans, of South Carolina, *&c. Bat Presidential aspirants, the Northern Democrats, -and the Republicans were for the most part strongly in favour of testing the forbearance of Great Britain by an indignant rejection of the treaty."
e-ts WVashington correspondent writes
"The opposition to the Central American treaty, negotiated between Lord Clarendon and Mr. Dallas is chiefly directed to one point-the large boundaries which Great Britain, or rather Lord Palmnerston, has heretofore claimed for the Mosquito kingdom, and which may be claimed again -under the present treaty, as the senators understand it. These boundaries are to be settled and definedunder the treaty, in such manner as to leave the Indians, as long as they remain on the soil, a suitable home. The treaty, if -carried out in good faith, would not secure to them an usn-reasonable extent of territory. Bat it is objected that this matter is left ,ndefinite, and may become a source of ditfi*culty hereafter. On the part of a large majority of the Senate there exists a sincere desire to settle this Central .American question on reasonable terms, and such terms as -wil leave no ground for future dispute betwseen the United States and the Government of Great Britain. The Senate will, probably, remodel the treaty, as they have done in -other cases.'
The Washington correspondent of the Coutrier and, Bnquirer writes that the action of the Senate is not 'by any means fatal and conclusive, and that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will now enter into -correspondence with the Secretary of State in order to agree upon modifications to be proposed to the British Government. There is no Minister of -that Power at Washington, and that rendered it -certain that there would be no final action upon the subject dutring the present session of the Senate. It states that the provision of the treaty which produced most excitement and opposition in the Senate was its recognition of the Wilmot proviso. The ,proviso is incorDorated in the convention with Honduras, which stipulates that, inasmuch as slavery does not now exist in the Bay Islands, it shall never be introduced there, but shall be perpetuaUy prohibited. MIr. Douglas is stated to have suim. med up the case against the treaty with elaborate vehemence, and to have denounced British iaterference in American affaim, and advanced ideas analogous to the most extreme pretensions of exclusiveness set up under the Monroe doctrine at the close of which, to prevent its immediate rejection, the treaty was referred.
The Yewv Yorkl Herald's correspondent expresses an opinion that the new Senate will confirm the treaty which will be submitted to them, and that it will then be sent to England, and in the present entente dordlale of the two nations there is very little doubt of its immediate ratification by our Government.
In the House of Representatives the Senate's Submarine Telegraph Bill had been committed to the Post-office Committee by a majority of 12. The Tariff Bill had been discussed without any result.
It is reported that the naval committee of the ~Senate have prepared a Bill authorizing the construction of an armed steamer of 500 tons burden, for the protection of American commerce from piratical attacks in the shallow waters, creeks, and rivers of China, and asking an appropriation of $120,000 for that purpose.

The schooner Jane T. Glover had been seized at New York on a charge of being fitted oat as a slaver. The cabinet warehouse of Mr. Bosch, at the corner of bIercer-street and Blecher-street, had been destroyed by fire, and Mr. Bosch and his wife had perished in the flames. The loss was between ,$60,000 and $80,000.
In Louisville, Kentucky, property to the amount -of $1So,000 had been destroyed by a fire. [a Mobile the Plante's, Eants', and Montgomery cotton presses had been burnt, and 10,000 to 15,000 bales of cotton consumed.
The freshets consequent upon the breaking up of -the ice had caused considerable damage. At Albany the damage was computed to reach $2,000,000. Two families on the island opposite the city are reported to have been carried away. At St. Louis the river had risen 18 feet, and was still rising, with immense -quantities of floating ice. The Missouri was open to -Jefferson City; the Illinois all the way up, and ,had risen 12 or 15 feet, and was still rising. The Upper Mississippi was also rising. There had been heavy rainis geuerally throughout the west, and numerous slides had occurred on the railroad. At Chicago the damage had been immense, and it wvas feared several lives had been lost. Several railway bridges had been carried away. Both branches of the river had risen several feet, and -the south-west portions of the city were submerged. The damage to the Chicago, Barlington, and Quincy ,railroads a-as estimated at $100,000. The river was, however, falling. Six vessels which had been driven from their moorings had been found near Port -Ontario, and five of them taken into port. At Newark, New Jersey, the freshet had swept away before it 50 schooners, sloops, barges, and canal boats. A great deal of property was damaged in the warehouses by the water, and the loss was estimated at $50,000. In one street the water waa four feet deep.

The Staff.
THB SrAFF.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TINES.
Sir,-When the " pitiable and heartrending'
condition of the British army was first made known to the English people in your columns those who were too wel convinced of the truth of the sad tale to meet it by a direct denial were content to hint that the inexperience and inefficiency of the Staff had a good deal to do with the miseries of the troops. " Bnt what else can one," said our Solons, " expect under the system?" Having diverted a good deal of public attention to " the system," they next appeased the feelings of excitement and irritation which their orn declaration had mainly created by adroit assurances that henceforth aU would go well, that "the system" 'would be radicaly altered, and that the Staff, having obtained that which it most required-knowledge of the duties of a Staff-by actual service in the field, would form a nucleus of able and intelligent officers who would meet the requirements of the service wherever they might be called on for active duty.
Those who have read the letters of "A Staff Officer" from head-quarters can judge of the amount of information likely to be afforded to the chief of an army by some of the young gentlemen whom the system thrust into places for which they were so httle suited; but there can be no doubt that a good many zealous, clever, and scientific officers were on the Staff of the Crimean army, and that men were "found out" from time to time among the regimental officers who justified in the amplest manner the judgment of those who selected them for Staff appointments. Now, I am quite ready to admit that it was very difflcult for the authorities to satisfy the claims of aU these officers in time of peace, and that it would have been impossible to provide for the whole of the late Staff, but surely they had a claim to be preferred to other officers wvho had not seen such realities of war, and whenever the choice lay between a Crimean officer and one without service, czteris paribus, the former ought to have been appointed. A glance at the A rmy List will show that our Staff appointments are exceedingly numerous, and that they would meet the claims of a very large t'tat mod or. Now let us see what the Crimean Staff have got, and then judge how far everything has been done to provide for them. It is quite true that some few of the best have been employed, and that some of the worst are vegetating in congenial idleness, but any one who knows the Crimean army will observe in the list I subjoin, which is, I hope, very nearly correct, that many officers whose abilities and devotion to their profession were undoubted and recognized have been shelved to make room for incapables:-

NEW YORK, EBB. 10.
The apprehension exprmesed in former letters that the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty would not be afBrmed by the Senate has been justified by the result. At the close of the adjourned discussion on the 6th inst. it was, by a very large majority (33 to 8), referred back to the Committee on Foreign Relations for amendment,-in other words, rejected. This issue of the negotiation, concluded by an American Minister invested with full powers by his Government, will be received with regret in England, where it was, no doubt, believed that the questions involved had been finally eettled. It should be clearly understood that the rejection of the treaty is not the act of the Administration; the Senate, which is a most important branch of the Executive, as well as a legislative body, has the power of affirming or rejecting all treaties made with foreign States, and in this case has chosen to reverse, or, at least, suspend, the act of the Admmistration. Both Governments are alike checked for the moment, and they will have to reconsider the terms of the treaty, and try whether the objections raised by the Senate may not be removed. Unfortunately, the opposition is not wholly based on the terms of the treaty itself. The United States Senate is a very distinguished and a very powerful body, but it is not exempt from the influences of party spirit ; many of its leaders are mere politicians rather than statesmen, always speculating on political capital, old and new, and they cannot afford suddenly to lose such a stock of it as they -wvold do by the final settlement df so many vexatious disputes with England. It would be like the termination of a venerable Chancery suit to a host of attorneys. These politicians still run in an old rut. Their ancient theories were condemned by public opinion in the Presidential election, but the narrow escape of their uncomfortable and unconciliating "platform" from total destruction last November has not yet been a warning. As far as the general feeling can be ascertained, the rejection of the treaty by the Senate is not approved; in the great commercial centres and the eastern States it is much regretted for the bad effect it will produce, For this reason, it would be premature to say the treaty is entirely lost. There is an impression abroad that it has not been rejected wholly on its own demerits. Of late the Senate has shown anything but resDect for the policy of the present Administration. It has repeatedly passed bills over the veto of President Pierce; and the rejection of a treaty that would have enabled him to quit office with the credit of closing these vexatious disputes may have been dictated by something of the same spirit. As the treaty was discussed in what is called an Executive Session of the Senate, only the decision is fully known; the facts and arguments on which it is to be presumed the vote was founded are only surmised, or given as rumours. The chief objections to the treaty are, it is understood, that it recognizes the British CentralAmencan protectorate more distinctly even than the Clayton-Bulwer Convention; that it confirms certain " British usurpations" in Central America heretofore disallowed; and that it is altogether an "entangling alliance" with England, at variance with the spirit of the Monroe doctrine, which condemns all political alliances with foreign States in anything touching the affairs of the western continent. The matter has been complicated by the treaty between England and Honduras, growing out of the settlement effected by the treaty of London. The treaty with liondura3 was not before the Senate, but it is said to have considerably affected the result. In it England stipulates that slavery shall be for ever prohibited in the colony of the Bay Islands. By accepting mr. Dallas's treaty, the Senate, it is understood, feared it might be sanctioning some other agreement, " limiting the extension of slavery." This is the entangling alliance against which the blow is struck. Anything limiting the area over which slavery may hereafter extend, whether in Kansas, or Nicaragua, or Honduras-whether in a territory of the Federation or an independent Republic-is opposed by the present leaders of the Democratic party. The Northern section of that partyis even more violent in defending the system and providing for its extension than the ablest men of the South, who are generally the most moderate. Unfortunately, they are the minority, and their influence is overborne by the more fiery and uncompromising champions of the system and their Northern allies. This antislavery stipulation is in all probability the real stumbling-block. Any measure by which the independent States of Central America may endeavour to protect themselves against the invasion of slavery is jealously resented, if it cannot for the moment be forcibly prevented; and that England is a party to raising the barrier makes the offence greater. It is becoming evident that the great bulk of Northern opinion in America wiU not permit the further spread of slavery over territory approaching the Northern States; the attempt has been made and resisted so sternly that any repetitions of the experiment will be unsafe. But Central America is a possible field, and the feeling of the North is not strong enough against slavery in the abstract to inspire a crusade against it, provided it does not absorb soil available to free labour. The North is shut against slavery in fact; but the South must not be closed against it by treaties. That appears to be the real meaning of "entangling alliances," and furnishes some, if not a full, explanation of why they are rejected.
By the arrival of the steamer Cahawba, from Grey Town, some further accounts of the state of things in Nicaragua have been received. Of Walker himeelf nothing has been heard since the seizure of the steamers on the San Juan and the Lake by the Costa Ricans. He is supposed to be hemmed in at Rivas, and, it -was rumoured, treating for a capitulation. The President of Costa Rica, General MIora, has published a proclamation, notifying the capture of the steamers, arms, ammunition, and prisoners in the late operations. The prisoners have been since liberated. The proclamation offers a pardon to aU who may abandon Walker, which some of the last recruits, seeing the state of affairs on the Isthmus, have done. General Mora allows some expressions to escape him in the proclamation which indicate that Nicaragua itself has not contribated much help to the late successful movement, and that all the work was left to the Costa Ricans. The local Bolein Oftcial, of January 14, publishes
the correspondence seized along with the arms and ammunition on board Walker's steamer, the Virgin. It consists of letters from Mlr. Morgan, the steamboat proprietor of New York (to whom Walker transferred the transit route and the steamers on it, from Mr. Vanderbilt), addresed to Walker himself and General Henningsen. They give a list of the stores shipped to Punta Arenas from New York, 400 rifles and 100,000 ball cartridges with other items. He hopes the articles "will arrive safe, and be very useful.' They have arrived safe, and will be very useful-to the enemy. As it was reported that among Walker's recruits detained at Punta Arenas, unable to ascend the river, there were some British subjects -very willing to abandon the enterprize-they had been induced to join here in total ignorance of the state of affairs-Captain Erskine, of Her Majesty's ship Orion, the senior officer on the station, sent Captain Cockburn, of the Cossack, on shore, to offer them protection if they chose to quit. Captaia Cockbum proceeded to the quartm Qf the detughment, and Qolonel Lockdidge,
it commauder, athis desiremusteredtherecruit.The offer of protectionwas read to the men, and 12 imtnediately stepped out and claimed it, and were taken beyond the reach of intimidation, under protest from Walker's officer. It has longbeen knownthat many of Walkers men, even when they had served the period of their engagements, could not leave the colutry, as ho would not give them passports, without which they could not embark. Persons crossing the isthmus as passenger3 have even been detained, and compelled to join his army. Those who were American citizens had no remedy, but they have complained loudly of the oppression. The letters seized with the stores on board the Virgin prove, what has long been suspected, that the miserable war has been maintained by the two rival steamboat compauies, fighting each other for po3session of the transit route. Mr. Morgan has subsidized Walker, and supplied him with arms and provisions, in order to keep possession of the steamers W^'alker had transferred to him. Mr. Vanderbilt, from whom they were taken, bas made equal efforts to regain them, and has shown the ablest generalship. Walker's most formidable enemy has conducted the campaign from New York.
The persons arrested a few days since on the charge of enlisting men for General Walker are undergoing what is supposed to be a trial in the United States Commissioners Court; it is not yet concluded. The district attorney has discovered, very late in the day, as the process has been going on for two years, that the " emigration" scheme is a fraud and a blind, as everybody has long known it to be. The official indignation is now merely ludicrous; the interference of the authorities at the outset would have been a mercy to the poor deluded wretches who have lost their lives in the operations against an independent State with which the great Republic is at peace; but there was no political capital to be made out of such interference, so the majesty of the law has been insulted with impunity by an office in Broadway, over which waves a huge banner promising free farms and a passage to all " emigrants" to Nicaragua, each of whom was supplied with a rile as an agricultural implement. It is calculated that 6,000 men who accepted these "free farms" have perished; and the only use the spade has been turned to in the country was to dig their graves. Had Walker really colonized, and not endeavoured to conquer and enslave, he might possibly have founded a new State. But the emigration pretext was a wretched farce to all but those who were inveigled into it.
The report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Charges of Corruption at Washington is very soon to appear. Other business has been almost suspended by the inquiry. The correspondent of the New York Times has been released from custody.
I esterday was the tenth day of the inquest in the case of the murder of Dr. Burdell. The mystery baffles all attempts to penetrateit, andvery little more is really known than at the very beginning of the investigation. Whoever committed the murder must have been as cool and calculating as he was desperate, for every trace and evidence of the act have been concealed. Nothing has been proved, but a strong motive on the part of the woman Cunningham and the lodger Eckel, supposed to be her paramour. Burdell latterly lived in dread of the whole family, and on the very day of the murder asked a friend to come and spend the night with him, stating he felt a terror that something would happen. It is altogether a most extraordinary case, well calculated to excite the deepest interest. The woman's daughter has deposed clearly that her mother was married privately to Burdell in October last, and that she was present as witness. The evidence that Burdell was personated is tolerably strong, though not decisive, while all his conduct subsequently is wholly at variance with the supposition that he had married her. She executed legal documents and agreements with him in her own name, which he took as carefully as if she had been a stranger, though they must have been utterly valueless if she was his wife; and he was a very sharp man of business. One was an agreement, made only three weeks ago, to give up the tenancy of the house in M1ay. On the day after the murder he was to have granted a lease to other persons, and she knew the fact. This is supposed to have hastened the completion of the plot from the nature of which it appears that his death must have been determined. 'lhere is proof enough of motive, but of the act none whatever. There is a fatal defect in the evidence. The inquiry has been conducted with an imbecility perfectly incredible. The loudly expressed disgust of the public at the levity of the coroner during the first two days of the inquest put a stop to his indecent jokes, and he allowed the after examinations to be conducted by two or three professional men; but this of itself caused confusion. T here was no method in the proceedings; precious time has been lost, and the faint clues that might have been followed up will now perhaps never be recovered. The coroner put the whole family into close confinement, as witnesses; as such they apphed for a writ of habeas corpus, in the return to which he specified Eckel and Mrs. Cunningham as being detained as accomplices, charged with the murder. By order of the Superior Court all the witnesses, except these two, were released; but these chief witnesses, being changed into principals, of course immediately took other ground, and by the advice of their counsel, on being brought up for examination, refused to answer any questions. The blunder will most likely be fatal to the case. Their testimony, whatever it might have been, is lost, and, as principal or accessories, the evidence against them is only presumptive, hardly amounting to circumstantiaL It is something quite unexpected to find an exaggerated spe'cimen of the Dogberry genus high in offlice in this exceedingly "smart" city; it might have been thought a natural impossibility; yet here he is, a most astounding product of the ballot-box, fussy, pompons, and obtuse, surpassing the hitherto received type of official stupidity. The indignation excited by his mismanagement is very great, but very useless, except as a lesson for the future.

The prisoners, two men and two women, who gave the names of James Miller, William Green, lary Ann Haseelston, and Cordelia Greensted vere cleverly captured at Chatham by Superintendent Everist, of the county constabulary, in a ounse at the foot of Chatham Lines, which they appear to have made their head-quarters, as at the time the officers visited the premises they discovered a great deal of property, which had, no doubt, formed portions of numerous burglarieg. The prisoners were first chareed with having burglaiously entered the farmhouse of Mr. Stephen Collison at Staple-

The Colliery Explosion near Babnsley.
The COLLtERY EXPLOSIONnearBABRSNLBY.
LUNDHILL, S&TURDAY EVrNXG.
At4 o'clock this morning Abraham Turner, of Wathupon-Dearne, one of the 19 miners got out of the pit alive, died. It was erroneously reported that he was dead on Friday evening. It is expectedthatMr Buager, the county coroner, will open au inquest on view of the body on Mlonday.
On Friday evening it was decided by a number of scientific and practical gentlemen, who have assumed tho responsibility of the steps to be taken for restoring the pit to a safe state, that it should be flUed with incombustible gas. Arrangements were at once made to carry out this decision; but owing to its being afterwards determined to delay the experiment until tbe committeehad consulted Mr. Nicholas Wood, an eminent colliery-viewer from the neighbourhood of Dnrham, the apparatus has not yet been put into operation. In case this experiment should be tried and failand It is stated that it has not invariably succeeded-it is thought that the only alternative will be to fill the mine with water. As a brook runs near, this could be easily effected, but the immense labour of pumping it out again and the consequent delay would mal;e the plan a very costly one. In accordance with the directions of the managing committee the upcast shaft was during Fniday night nearly closed up, but not wholly so, lest it should cause a further explosion. A considerable quantity of whito vapour continues to issue from the aperture left in the upeast shaft, indicating that there is stil an intense heat in the pit. Tests have, however, been applied, from which it would appaar that the heat is considerably abating. At 4 p.m. on Friday a thermometer was suspended 20 yards down the upeast shaft, and the test has bcen several times repeated, showing that tho heat has gradually fallen from 105 deg. on Friday afternoon to S5 deg. at the same hour on Saturday. At the latter period a piece of wood and i piece of iron were lowered to tho bottom of the upcast shaft by means of a piece of tarred rope. On being drawn up at the end of a quarter of an hour it was found that neither the wood nor rope had been charred or burnt, the wood and iron being but slightlywarmed. From this it would seem that the heat is greatly abating. It is only fair to state, however, that water is flovring somewhat largely from the sides of the ahaft, and, as the water had evidently faUen upon the wood and iron, ithad no doubtinfluenced the result of the experiment.
The exact number of persons in the pit has not yet been ascertained, but in addition to those published on Saturday (150) the names of about 20 more sufferers havo beeu asceriained. Mr. Nicholas Wood arrived at the place about 4 o'clock p.m. on Saturday, accompanied by Mr. Gillott, of Monkwearmouth, coliery viewer.
On the subject of the exploration of the mine and closing of the downcast shafts the Man,e ster Guardian of Saturday says:-
"B etweeen balf-past 4 and 5 o'clck (on Thursayaftemoou) a onsultatlon waw held between Mr. Coe and some of the leading mineral viewers of the neighbourhood, as to making an attempt to explore the main road as far Ma rossdbe. The general opinion was that Imminent danger awalted those who ight maake the effort, while some thongbt therewa3 a pomiblity of the risk not being great. But each atood there ready for the attempt; each volunteered, cimly and after con-
ideratlon, to fawe a danger greater than that of moet battle-fields. When the preparatlons had been completed Wr. CGe got into tbh cage. aceompanie-d by Mr. Webster, ot the Wombwell Main Oollery, and Mr. Maddison, of the Hoyland and Elsecar pits. They got to the bottom, and made their way to the outh for 300 yards, doing all than waa posslble to make good the doors and stopp. )g that had been blown out, and thus partially to restore the ventilation. They parsed some dead bodies, and saw othern lying at abott ditatnces In the workings, but their number was not great
and s tbey found no one aUre, they were not diverted from their object-that of assertaining what could be done done to cheek the fire an de ar the workings of gas, so that a search might be made. But when they got within sight of the furnace under the venlatilug shaft they discovered that, all around it the coal bad ignited and was burning iereely. Nothing could tberefore be done in that direction; so the three brave fellows returned to the eye of the upcast, and after breathing awblhle there they groped their way along the north leveL They went 400 yards. still occasionally passing cerpses, hut unrbeered by a sight or sound that indicated tbe vicinity of any to whom they could be the messengers of hope or life. One thing was eatisaactory-uo d.ro was visible upon that side. But when they retraced their teps, snd got again to the south of the up ceaz they found the fire spreading so rapidly along the coal and the beat becoming so lnteure, that they decided to give up the sarch, feeling thst they could aid no one, and that to remain longer would be wantonly to riak zheir own Uves. And it was time to retreat; for, whie all auffered very mueb, one of the tbree was nearly overpowered by the rulohur, and, falling, he narrowly escaped bring enwrapped by the dwase.
1 The three6gentlemen named bad thus spent more thau an hour snd -half continuoudy in the btuing mine. TheIr prolonged absence cmused the greatest anxiety as to their fate, and the fears Were much heightesed by what oconrred not long before the watched-for signsl from below wasbeard. Forabouttbattime the fiamee shot up high above the cupola ;'bricks and shattered timbers were scattered far and near; the lurid glare spread over mies ortcountry, sad a broad, well- defined streak of soot and ashes was deosited across several of the adjoining fieds whUie thobank was covered with coal and wood sareor Those below knew nothingcof what had occurred; those above attributed It to a second explosion, which had probably done immense damage to the works. There Is no doubt that what we have described was coincident with the rapid extesuSon of the flanes, which Placed tbh searchers in so much danger.
"Another long and anxious consultation was held; and ita reRult was a deternination to cover with boards and puddling the mouths of the upCast and pumping shafts. At this time the lesel ground and the 'teep slope between We,mbwell and the colliery were crowded; and when the determination became known- It naturally staggered the hopeful and appalled to sUen tbose who had carcely dared to hope that yet mxny human bein * might bo got up alire. That the meaure sho wed on the part of the proprietors, viewers, ke., a conviction that no hope oould be entertained that any one below war alive fi true; but, ovon Ite such had not been their conviction, they believed that such a ttep was the most prudentiaL For it was felt that no search could be attempied while tho fire raged, sad that no cunecould get through the fire to the shaft, so as to escape; that nothlng oould be done untll the fire was at least cheked; and that it could not be oheoked umtil the ingress of air was prevente. The (feet of stopping the two shafts wasEoon seen in the diappearance cffiamlesiromthe cupola;' but the smole showed tha;tlacoalwas stillUmouldering most extensively, and that no one oould reach the lottom alive.'
The proprietors of the pit felt that in permitting the downcast shafts to be closed they incurred a most grave responsibility, and, as stated in ne Timc3of Saturday, they during Friday morning took the opinion of a number of colliery viewers and other gentlemen, whom they invited from the surrounding aistrict, upon the subject. That opinion waS one of unanimous approvaL In order to set themselves right with the publin tho proprietors and the gentlemen by whom that course had been advised again called the colliery viewers and other gentlemen together and invited the representatives of the press to be present at the meeting to hear the opinions on the subject. There were present Mr. J. Woodhouse Day, an eminent colliery viewer from Derby, in7 the chair; Mr. C. Bartholomew, South Yorkshire Company; Mr. Henry Holt, of Wakefield; Mr. Beecher, of Chapeltown; Messrs. S. and T. Sutcliffe, of Barnsley; Mr. Maddison, of Barnsley; Mr. Charles Morton, Government Inspector; Mr. Webster, of Hoyland; Mr. Coo, of Lundhill; Mbr. Peacock, of B:nsley; Mr. Chambers (Newton, Chambers, and Co.); and the proprietors of the mine.
The ClAruRuA?, referring to the closing of the downcast shafts, justly observed that such a measure wvs calcalated to excite public feeling, considering that a great number of bodies were left in the pit; but it was the only hope. The accident occurred at half-past 12 o'clock, so that a period of seven hours elapsed before the pit was closed. Another resolution was that Messrs. Webster, Coe, and Maddisen should be deputed to carry out the views of the committee. The proprietors of the colliery were called in, and were informed of what had been done, and wereofully satisfied. The opinion of Mr. Woodhouse was that practical men should carry out the views of the committee, rather than 'that the responsibility should rest upon the owners of the pit. The committee would consist of Messrs. Woodhoase, Hartack, Holt, Webster, the Messrs. Maddison, Mr. CooDer, Mr. Sellars, Mr. Carr, and Mr. Cbild, all practical rDen connected with the colliery.
Mr. WEBsTvxn gavo an account of the result of his visit to the mine. On getting to the bottom of the rh.ft they found that the lover portion of the slides and brordgates were entirely blown up and destroyed, and on proceeding furtber they found the coal around the furnace was in a complete state of ignition. The coal and woodwork in the up=ast shaft had taken fire, and the flames were raging furiously. He could compare it to nothing but to a stream of molten metal being poured down the shaft. They proceeded about 200 or 250 yaArds along the south level, and found the whole of the furnace down, and the coal on fire; They proceeded up the levels and hroadgates as far as they dared to venture uantil they
came mn contact with the foul air, *nd were obliged to retreat. They returned to the shaft, and then made au
examinatiol of the north levels, along which they proceeded for a distance of 400 yards, up to the fourth broadgate. During the investigation they found many dead bodies, aid the men who accompanied them brought the remains to the shaft. One nian was found dead close to the bottom of the shaft; further on they found 10 bodies in a mass. Not far from the furnace it was supposed that a largo number of bodies were lying, as the men generally congregated near the fixe at dinner time. The furnace was blown down, and the stables (containing six horses) were on fire. When they got near the upeast shaft they saw immense mnasses of coal and rock falling down. The shaft was like a furnace. The difference in the s4te of the fir when he entered the pit and when he left it was very great. They were in the pit above two hours. The stoppages and brattices between the two shafts were completely blown away, and therefore, except in the level, the pit was dead-i. e., full of bad air. They would have succeeded in putting up stoppages, but the fire increaed to snco an extent that they were otliged to retreat. They were so placed that if they had not retreated they would have been excluded from the air and auffocaed, because tho air was " banking " direct from one shalt to the other. He, Mr. Coe, and Mr. Maddison ascended the shaft and held a consultation, hut their companions ascended in hate, saying that it Was ir,. possible for any one to remain down any longer. Of cor-,t they then considered it their duty to acquaint the owIners with the position of the mine, and So atte tlsg jt

the me4 wsOe had gone down with them. Thef wer
called in separately, and asked if they were of opinion that it was impossible to get any more bodies oat of the mine. They concurred with them, and they acted upon their resolution and their own by covering over the tops of the pits. In a few minutes after they left the mine the cupola shft was filled with fire, which reathed 50 yards above the Plsmmit, and the sparks from that body of flame asdended 100 yards higher.
Mr. MoaroN (Govermnent Inspector).-This was very strong evidence that you had nearly remuned too long.
3Ir. MADDISON confirmed the statements of Mr. Webster. He particularly mentioned the immense difference they found in the state of the flames from the time they first saw them until they left the pit. The fire was really awftl when they came back. When they passed the stables at first they could go up to the fire and kick the embers with their feet, but when they came back they dorstnot approach the plece; the flames extended from one end to the other. They would have been killed if they had not retreated at the time they did.
Mr. C. BA.RTHOL0oMIW expressed hLisconviction that all the men in the pit must be dead.
Mr. WXBSTER added that he had reported his proceedings to the committee, who concurred with him as to the propriety and prudence of the course he had ado ted
Mr. MoRToN deolated his concurrence in the prudence of the measures which had been adopted, as explamned by Mr. Webster and Mr. Maddison. The responsibility which Mesr. Coe, Webster, and Maddison had asumed of closing a pit which contained more than 150 persons was a very fearful responsibility, but. they bore it creditably, ana the measures tegy had adopted could not have been improved under the circumstances.
Mr. BARTHOL0OMv.-It would be satisfactory to the publc to be assured that the pit was not closed until there remained no chance of saving any more lives.
Mr. MoRTsON expreased his approval oi a proposal which had been made to force carbonic scid gas into the pit with a view to extinguish the fire yet burning. If the pits had not been closed they would not have been able to get into them again for many months; the probability was thiat the shafts would have closed themselve-, and the loss of the w hole colliery would have been imminent. There could not be two opinions that when the shafts were closed therm was not a man living in the pit. He supposed, of courso, that the search was not abandoned until all hopes of recovering any bodies were extinguished.
Mr. WxnsTzR.-Certainly not. I did not leave that mine until every hope was gone. The men who accompanied us begged us to return, but we did not come back until we were positively frightened for our own lives. If we had remained longer we should have been lost.
The LsspxcroR said that he should spare no exertion to bave the cause of the accident foUy investigated when the proper time arrived. He suggested to the ovrners that they should do their best to allay the grief of the persons who were bereaved of their friends. Many of them were not only suffering intense mental anguish, but it was to be feared were suffering also from want of food and money.
The CI niaAN aid the proprietors of the colliery had given 5001. as a beginning to the subscription, and he had no doubt the example would be folowed.
On all hands it is stated that the Lundhil Colliery was regarded as almost the model mine of the district' that the air-ways were spacious, the ventilating durrent anple ; and that the proprnetors had from the first spared no, expense in doing all that could be suggested to make and keep the workings in the saest state possible. Although the seam is admitted to be " fiery," it is stated that accumnulations of gas, even smaU in bulk, were very rarely discovered, The firemenhad strict orders, which the proprieters do not supposevwere disobeyed; and the working rules generaUy, having been drawn up with care, have been strictly enforced. Corbridge, the fireman who was below at tho time of the explosion, and is now alive, bas stated that everything was most satisfactory during Thursday forenoon, and that up to tho fatal moment he considered the mine as safe as at any period since it was opened. If firedamp was discovered during the inspections early in the morning, or at any otber time, a board, bearing the word " fire" in conspicuous letters (white, with a red ground), was hung at the entrance of the particu!.r working, and the occupiers of it were bound not to enter until permitted by the fire.- men. The systm of working was that of "leading and following banks " the ventilation round the face of the coal was considered excellent, and no pillars have wet been ' robbed " or "got." Indeed, althoughthe minehas been worked extensively during the two years it has been in operation-the average being about 600 tons a-day-only IS acres have yet been "got." But, having stated these facts, it remains to be added that the men worked with candles, safety lamps being very rarely used by them, and never except when the firedamp was known to exist. It issaidthat there has only been one previous fatal accident in the Lundhill coUiery. That was from an explosion of firedampaccumulated between Satarday and Monday, during the sinking of the shafts; and it caused the deaths of two or three persons. The coroner for the district is MIr. Badger. hut nothing has transpired as to when an inquest will be comnmenced; and evidently no idea can be formed of when it wil be possible to pursue the inquiry into the cause of this deplorable accident.
Since the above was varitten the result of a long and earnest consultation, held on Saturday evening at the offices of the proprietors, by Messrs. Day (in the chair), 1X. Wood, C. Morton, Government Inspector, EUiott, and other colliery owners, has been made known. The decision arrived at was not to try the experiment of introducing incombustible gas into the mine, but only to introduce steam and allow a considerable quantity of water to accumulate in the workings. This state of things is to continue until Wednesday next, when it is understood that Mr. Wood and the other members of the managing committee wiU again meet and consider what further steps may be necessary. From what was stated it would appear that the committee are of opinion that the heat in the pit is very greatly abated; but they have given directions for the shafts to be stiU more securely closed up, being of opinion that if any considerable current of air were permitted to pass into the mine an explosion of a more violent character would result, and the pit be again set on fire. During Saturday the houses of the miners who have perished were visited by members of the firm of Taylor and Co., who afforded relief to the necessitous.

The Russians In Circassia.-The Caucase of
TIE RussAwes mN CLmCASSI"-Tho Caucase of Tiftis gives the following account of an expedition of the Russians in the Great Tchetchnia, for the purpose of openingwitk the hatchet a passago through the forest of Macourtoupe, which is considered one of the getest obstacles to the conquest of the territory of the Tchetchenes:-" This forest, bordered on one side by ravines and precipices, which
*d bate it from Fort Vozdvijenskii, and on the oppsi.o sice7by the wooded mountains of Katchkalyk, which *ivide it from the table land of Koumnyk, presented by its topographical position great advantages for an obstinate defence. One part of the troops destined to operate in the Great Tchetchnia assembled near Fort Groznoi, the other, under the command of General Baron de Nicolai, took up a position near Konmyk, and a small detachment establshed itself as an advanced guard on the right bank of the Argoune, opposite Fort BerdikeL The commandinchief of the expedition was given to General Eddokimof. On the
17th of December thc three corps, acting in concert, established themselves on the two banks of the Mitchik, near the old Fort of Gourdali. On the following day they made a reconnaissance in the forest of Maiourtoupe, and the day after commenced the work of cutting down the trees. The mountaineers were deceived as to the object of the movement of the Russian troops, and it was not until the middle of December that Schamyl was able to collect a considerable force, which he placed under the command of his sons, charging them to drive the Russians out of the forest; bu6 the latter were already masters of the ground, and only some insignificant skirmishes took place. On the 31st of December the passage through the forest was open, and on the following day the troops returned to their winter quarters. The loss of the Russians during the whole operation was confined to eight men killed and 25 wounded."

although freeontly hunted through the counties of Waterford, Clare, Tipperary, and Kilkenny, his description constantly appearng in the Hue and fry. However, Constable Crowe, of the Slate-quarry Constabulary Station, acting on private information as to the delinquent being at work in his father's quarry, a distance of about two niles from the barracks, laid an admirable plan for his capture, and subsequently carried it out with success on Friday last. The quarry is on an eminence, from which all approaches are visible for a considerable distance, so that no policeman eould oome near the spot unobserved by one on the look-out, and therefore Fitzpatrick considered himself safe, as he frequently boasted of defying the whole pohce force to catch bim when once at arm's length from them. The constable sent two men in plain clothes by a circuitous route to place themselves at a given point on the Tipperary side of the quarry, and two more, similarly attired, by another devious path, to place themselves also at a specified place at the Kilkenny side of the quarzy; while he himself with two men in uniform, fully armed, proceeded from the barracks direet.

SATURDAY, FE. 21, 5 P.M.
Colonel Ouseley, Professor of Persian, and interpreter of that language to the East India Company, has arrived in Paris from London. He has brought despatches for the British Ambassador, whom he is to assist in his conferences with Feruk Khan, which are to be resumed on Monday. It is said that the British Governmenit, besides the Island of Earrack, demands authority to found an establishient on the Island of Ozmus, and to establish dep6ts of coal on several points of the Persian coast. Letters received from Teheran almost all speak of the fact of a recent treaty between Russia and Persia. The only difference of opinion among the writers is as to the terms of th e treaty.
A telegraphic despatch received from Jassy, dated the 18th inst., announces that the conmission ap-
haine dt e possession of the Bessarabian
left Jassy the same day to perform their mission. At that date it was knowrn at Jassy that the fireman for the convocation of the Divans had been received at Galatz.
A letter from Cadiz announces that, according to the latest intelligence received there from South America, the difference between the Mexican and Spauish Govern-ments had entered a newphase. After having exhausted all means of conciliation, M. de Sorela, Minister of Spain, had demanded his passports, quitted the city of Mexico, embarked on board of the Perla frigate, and anchored in the bay of Vera Cruz, which had been placed at his orders by General Concha, Captain-General of Cuba.
It is said that several French officers have asked permission to serve with the Spanish expedition against Mexico.
The sat itsctionel, in a semi-official shape, offers the following excplanations relative to the secret convention which formned the subject of the late animated discussion in the House of Commons between Lord Palmerston and Mr. Disraeli:-
'4 A debate of some warmth took place a fewdays ago in the House of Commons on a subject which specially interested the French Government. A celebrated orator of the Opposition, Mr. Disraeli, asserted that a secret treaty existed between France and Austria since the period of the Eastern war, which guaranteed to the latter Power the security of its Italian posses sions; he added that this treaty had been signed in a regular manner, and that no limit restricted its duration. Lord Palmerston, in replying to Mr, Disraeli, proved the falsity of these allega. tions. The following, we believe, are the real circumstances of the case:-The treaty of the 2d of December,1854, stipulated, as is known, the eventual concurrence of the Austrian arnies im the struggle with Russia. The Cabinet of Vienna, however, represented that it could not enter with security into any warlike operations in the East as long as its Italian possessions should be menaced by the agitation fomented by political parties in the Peninsula; it therefore demanded that previous to placing itself in order of battle the security of its Italian lines should be assured. Circumstances gave considerable support to this demand of Austria. It 'was, in fact, essential that her apprehensions should be calmed, and every obstacle to the execution of the treaty removed. France, therefore, entered into negotiations on this point with the Cabinet of Vienna, and engaged herself in the above-menTioned convention to employ her offorts to maintain tranquillity in Italy during the period of the campaign. It was simply sought to assure to Austria the freedom of action necessary for her efficient concurrence in the collective operation of the allies. Such were the motives and thebearingof this arrangement, dictated by so high an interest, but only rendered obligatory in the event of Austria joining us in an active manner and declaring war against Russia. The convention was therefore essentially of an eventual and transitory character; it was an act commanded by the war-a circumstance in a certain respect analogous to those wnlch were adopted by the allies towards Greecewhenthe latterendeavoured to create a rising in Thessaly and Epirus in the interest of Russia. As it is known, the eventualities provided for were never called into existence; Austaia did not declare war and did not draw her sword. The object of the convention has therefore never existed. This document, in spite of the assertion of Air. Disraeli, can never have been carried into execution, and was not of a lasting nature; the re-establishment of peace haes transformed it into a dead letter."

AUSTRIA.

VIENNA, FEE. 18.
I have been assured to-day that the idea of placing Trieste, Istria, Dalmatia, the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, and the Southern Tyrol under one and the same Governor-General has never been entertained either by the Emperor or hisMinisters. It is credibly statedthat the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian has expressed his resolve not to accept the office of Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, unless the military as well as the oivil authorities of the country are placed under his control, and the refusal of the Emperor to accept the condition is supposedto have occasioned the sudden departure of the Archduke from Milan. At present the whole of the army receives its orders directly from the Military Central Chancellerie of the Emperor, and consequently the military com-
9manders are but nominally. subordipate to'the governors of the different provinces. 'fius,-if the Archduke Ferdinand-MAximilian were to receive the title of GbverboroGeneral, his military Adlatus would be in direct correspondence with the Military Central Chan~cellerie of His Majesty, and would only have to obey the orders received from it.
The news of the infamous behaviour of the two officers to ML Bianchi greatly excited the indignation of the Emperor, and Colonel Maller, an officer who enjoys the entire confidence of Mis Majesty. was immediately sent to Mantua to examine into the case. Authen ic information has to-day been received that an " extremely energetic" note was about a week ago addressed by Count Buol to the Sardinian Government. The Austrian Minister complained bitterly of the excessive license of the press, and expressed his indignation that the Ttrin Government should permit papers which openly recommend regicide to appear in Sardinia. Many persons fear that there wil be a regular rupture between the two Governments, but Austria has no intention of going to war with Sardinia. If the Turin Government does not undertake to keep the press within due bounds, Austria is likely entirely to break off her diplomatic relations with Sardinia, but she will not endeavour to obtain satisfaction by force of arus. A telegraphic despatch which has just arrived from Turin announces that the Ital4 e Popolo, the most vfiolent of the ultraRadical papers published in Sardinia, will cease to appear.
Baron Seebach, the Saxon diplomatist, has gone to Turin, but his business there is of a private nature. The Court of Sardinia and the widow of the late Duke of Genoa cannot agree about the education of the children of the latter, and Baron Seebach has received instructions to endeavour to settle the matter to the satisfaction of the Princess, who is now the wife of the Chevalier de Rapollo. King Victor Emmanuelwishes tohave thetwo sons of his deceased brother educated with his own children, and offers to leave the daughter in the hands of the mother, but to this plan the latter objects. The Roman papers accuse King Victor Emmanuel of " want of tact," because he refuses to permit the Pope to appoint Bishops to the vacant sees in Sardinia, but the public is of opinion that His Majesty is quite right in offering such determined opposition to the continual encroachmenbs of Rome.
In its number of the 16th of February the Nord avers that it is a matter of indifference to the Russian Government whether the Danubian Principalities are united or not; but the assertion obtains no credit here. Count Kisseleff was the author of the Statl't Organique (Organic Statute) of the Principalities, and any one who will take the trouble to read it will not fail to remark that when he wrote it he had some idea of a future union of Moldavia and Wallachia. On the 10th of this month the High Conoitory of the Protestant Church in Bavaria announced that its ordinances relative to confession, &c., would not be enforced, as they did not seem to have found favour with the different communities. The King of Bavaria, who is a Roman Catholic in the strictest sense of the w,ord, has just given a proof of his tolerant spirit by authorizing the Protestant pastors in his kin~doin to raise subscriptions for a monument which is about to be erected to the memory of Martin Luther at Worms.
A recent number of the lvuee Gazette contains an article entitled "Switzerland and the Diplomatists," in which it is openly said that the UltraCatholic party had hoped the conflict between Switzerland and Prussia " would lead to the overthrow of the existing order of things in the Confederation and the restoration of the rigime of 1847."

BERLIN, FZB. 18.
This session of the Prussian Diet-it is next to treason to call the two Houses "Chambers" any longer-finds the Ministry, in one respect, in a worse position, as to the country and its representatives, than any other session smce 1848 has done. It is compelled to ask the country for fresh or increased taxes, without being able to point out any one or more events to which they can conveniently ascribe the necessity for increased taxation; and, although Prussia is the lightest taxed country of which we have any statistical information, such is the " ignorant impatience of taxation" prevalent here, and so faulty the system onwhich the objects for taxation are chosen, that the task of raising a greater revenue out of the nation, although perfectly well able to afford it, may be likened to that difficult uindertaking known in popular phrase as the "extraction of sunbeams from cucumbers." This extreme difficulty of raising an increased revenue from a people that knows but one principle of economy, viz., that of not parting with money on any consideration, is fearfully enhanced by the necessity the Ministers are under of informing them at the same time of the great defects that exist in two branches of the State administration which every good Prussian is brought up to believe to be faultless, viz., the army and the finances. The same trouble that is bestowed in our National Schools in teaching children their catechisms and collects is bestowed here on impressing the " young idea" with a conviction of the faultlessness and supreme excellence of the Prussian military system and of Prussia's financial administration; in consequence, every good Prussian believes in these latter fictions far more devoutly than he does in his Bible, the authenticity of which latter may be treated or not as an " open question," without any injury to his standing as a citizen and subject.
The events of 1848, and the eight years that have succeeded it, have completely deprived the higher orders of Prussian officials of their devout faith in the finances and military organization of their country; but, such is the care with which such unpleasant notions have been kept back from the people, that now that Ministers openly admit what unbiassed persons long ago knew, the surprise and disgust of the people are added to their constitutional dislike to put their hands into their' ockets (for the purpose of taking anything out), an thns a most unusual amount of resistance is just now being offered here to the Ministerial proposals for increased taxation. One of the purposes for which increased pecuniary means are now required is an improvement in the efficiency of the army, and to this one subject I will for the present confine my remarks.
The Prussian army, like many other things in Prussia, is a " makeshift"; properly speaking, it is not an army at all, such as a European State must possess if it makes any claim to be one of the great Powers of Europe. The military organization of Prussia is a cleverly arranged system, by which a large proportion of the ablebodied male population is drilled and taught the use of arms for a short period, but it is not one that is calculated to make an army of soldiers; while, on the other hand, it most injuriously affects the prospects of the civilians, whom it interrupts in the pursuit of a livelihood, by imposing on them the necessity of serving for a longer or shorter time in the ranks. After the battle of Jena had given the deathblo'w to the system as perfected under Frederick the Great, and the reverses that succeeded that defeat had compelled Prussia to submit to the restriction of her military force to 42,000 men, Scharnhorst, Oneisenau, and others organized a plan on noble and highly enlightened principles, by which the whole male population should be trained in the use of arms, so that when a favourable conjuncture offered itself it might act in support of the standing army; but, as the obligations which Napoleoll bad imposed upon Prussia included a fixed limit to the force of her anmay, the aditional militia force was not called "Army" but "Landwehr," for the purposes of evading the letter of the treaty. Subsequently
sne standing army-the military force of professional soldiers devoted to the pursuit of arnls-was abolished in Prussia, chiefly from reasons of economy, and a portion of the new system, which in its original form, as an auxiliary to the army, -was admirable, was now adopted to replace the army itself. What is now called the " standing army " in Prussia is nothing more than the first or preparatory stage of the Landwehr, in which every ablebodied male is liable to serve for a short time, so as to learn the use of arrms, after which he enters into the first ban of the Landwehr, where he is liable to be called out
to exercise for a few days every autumn till he has completed his 32d year. Every ablebodied male, moreover, wvho has not been called out to serve in the so-called "standing army" belongs, nevertheless, to the first ban of the Landwehr, and thus the only difference between the said "standing army" and the first ban of the Landwehr is, that it is kept under drill for a couple of years or so, instead of a few days, under the conduct and instruction of able and intelligent officers, who are the only stable element in this so-called." standing army."
The original period'assigned for service in the active arniy was five years, .but this sacrifice of the best years of every.young man's life (from 20 to 25) was soon found te be too heavy a tax on the producfive pow.rs of the nation, as wvell as too oppresive to the individual, and in 1814 it was decided that in future three years should bethie period of service in Ihe active army, and that during the following two the recruits now in the reserve should have every
opportunity of forgetting what they had then learnt by not being caled out to exerci'e at all. In 1833 and 1837 this period of thirea years' service was again reduced, out of feelings of consideration for the. population, to two years for the infantry of the line, and this period has again been reduced in general practice to one year and a half, by calling out the recruits six months later than the law requires. The various occasions in 1848, and since then, in which the military force has come into requisition, have convinced the more experienced among the higher military officers of the necessity of a longer period of training, if the recruits here called an army are. to have any chance when pitted against any foreign army of veteran soldiers. The memorial which the Government has submitted to the Chambers in justification of the increase of the army estimates, incidental to the return to the three years' duration of service, adduces the longer period of service to which the military of other nations is subjected, the greaterfightingeapacity(&hfe,rtigkeit)they thereby attain, and the introduction of improved firearms, which make a longer period of practice necessary for the attainment of skill with them, as grounds of justification for the measulre, which is the more urgent in Prussia as the habits of unhesitating blind obedience which the recruit acquires in the active army are expected to exercise a lasting effect on the remainder of his life, both as civilian and Landwehrsmyann.
This plain statement of the truth on the subject of the army will be of still more service to the nation than tho actual improvement of the military force by the lengthened period of service. The enormous conceit of the people has always hitherto been flattered by telling them that they ate so much more educated and enlightened than the rest of the world, that, although 10, 15, or 20 years may be a necesary period of service for other soldiers, they, the Prussians, can acquire all that is necessary in the soldier's trade in a year and a half and at the expiration of that time be even ready to march into the field at an hour's notice more than a match for any man. This silly delusion on the part of the bulk of the people, coupled with the ignorance of the real state of the case on the part of other nations, is, in connexion with the glorious traditions of the old Fritz and Blucher times, the cause why we hear and read so much rubbish about the Prussians still being a military nation, which they are just as little as any other nation, if not indeed less so, while at the same time the knowledge on the part of their rulers how very hollow and unfounded all this presumptuous over-conceit is forms one of the many reasons for the pacific (d tott prixc pacific) policy of Prussia.
This measure for improving the efficiency of the army and making the people pay for it is a valuable step in the right direction, and may embolden future Ministers of War to go sti further. With better pecuniary means at command it would be possible to raise at any rate a few regiments of real soldiers out of men who enlist for a lengthened ?orioa, and who would thereby attain a certain Qegree of firnmes and self-reliance; with a comparatively small force of this nature, acting independently of the present Iandwehr and standing army, and availing itself of the unusual facilities which the Prussian railroads offer, from all concentrating in Berlin, they might do mnuch more efficient duty in the provinces or on the frontier than five times the numbor of men taken as they are now from their civil employments for a period of three years, with all their thoughts and interests inseparably bound up in the employments they have just left, and to which they are soon to return.

The new steamer Petropolis, which arrived here from Greenock, vi4 Cardiff, a few days ago, the second vessel belonging to the Brazilian-Hamburg Steam Navigation Company which has been built by Messrs. Caird and Co., of that place, for this recently formed line of regular packets, left yesterday afternoon on her first voyage thither, to follow the Teatonia, which left Southampton for Rio Janeiro in December last, and which latter ship made a very quick passage from that port to Lisbon in three days and a-half, thence again to Pernambuco in 13 days, and concluded her voyage to the Brazilian capital, rid Bahia, in 261 days inclusive; which passage has been considered one of the most fortunate aad quickest known. Another of the same class of ships is being built by the house of Caird and Co., to complete the number of those destined for this line, and will carry 2,400 tons instead of 2,000, the regulated tonnage of the frst two. These steamers wvill convey the Gxerman mails thither, and call at Southampton on their outward and homeward voyages, as well as at Lisbon and other places. The Petropolis has been got up in the most elegant style, as far as the cabins are concerned, for the convenience of the passengers. She measures 320 feet from stem to stern, has the number of 80 persons to form her crew, andcan conveniently carry 500 passengers, of whom 390 are to be between decks. The freight and passage money are extremely moderate, the former being mentioned at present as from 21. 10s. to 5l. per ton, according to the description of the goods, with 15 per cent. primage inclusive, either from Hamburg or Southampton; and the latter as 70 Prussian thalers (about 101. 10s.) from H1amburg to Lisbon; to Pernambuco, 240; Bahia, 260; and Rio, 280 in the first cabin; the second cabin, 50, 170, 190, and 210 respectively; between decks to Lisbon, 25; and the other places 70, including maintenance of passengers throughout. The ship has taken hence a very fair cargo and about 250 passengers as a commencement.
Information has been received from Bremen of a considerable fire having broken out yesterday forenoon in that city behbid the Church of St. Stephen, and much apprehension was entertained for the safety of the building and several large stores in the vicinity. No reliable accounts have been received thence this morning; but it is supposed, from this circumstance, that the fire has been mastered, or we should have heard something by telegraph tothe contrary.

TURIN, F-jn. 17.
An investiture of the Order of the Bath was held by Sir James Eludson, K.C.B., at the British Legation here to-day, in virtue of powers delegated0to him by Her MIajesty, to confer the order and insignia on the following officers, lately belonging to the Sardinian Crimean Expedition :-Generals John Durando and Trotti, with that of Knight Commander; and Colonel Petitti, Lieutenant-Colonel de la Rovere, Major Gavone, and Captain di Negro, R.N., with that of Knight Companion. The ceremony took place at half-past S this afternoon, in the Hlall of the Legation, and was attended by the Sardinian Ministers of State, the French Minister at this Court, uhe Duke de Grammont; Count Nigra, Minister of the Royal House (Privy Purse); Count Salasco, Prefect of the Palace; the Hon. Edward Erskine, Secretary of Legation; and Lord Hubert de Burgh, Attached.
Previous to the investiture Sir James Hiudson addressed the officers in Italian to this effect:-
"Gentlemnen,-My Sovereign, being desirous of marking
thel sense she entertains of the briliant qualities which you showed in the field, in conjunction with her troops aud those of her ally, the Emperor of the French, has asked the permission of the King yonr Sovereign to bestow upon you the insignia of the Order of the Bath, and His majesty King Victor Emmanuel having granted that permission, and Her Majesty the Queen, being prevented from having the satis-
faction of giving you these insignia herself, has caused a Royal warrant to be addressed to me, her Minister at the Court of the King your Sovereign, in order that the investiture may be performed with aU honour and dignity."
The ceremony of the investiture then took place with aU due formality, after which Sir James continued to address the newly-made niights, saying:-
" Gentlemen,-I beg to be permitted to express to yon my sincere hope that you may live long to enjoy your wellearned honoun; honours which could not shine on more galant breasts, and which are the proofs of that happy alliance and friendslsip between our countries that I f.ti assured it is our sincere wish to preserve unimpaired."
To this speech General Della Marmora, Minist. r of War, who wore the decoration of G.C.B., replied on the part of his officers, expressing their sense of the honour conferred on them, and concluded with a hope that the friendship commenced on the field of battle might be cultivated and matured in times of peace.
After the ceremony was concluded Sir James Eudson entertained all those present at dinner, and after dinner Count Cavour proposed the health of the Queen of England. Sir James Rudson then gave the health of King Victor Emmanuel, andafterwards '-hat of the Emperor of the French, upon
which the Duke de Grammont proposed the health of the Allied Armies, for which General Della Mfarmora returned thanks in a short and soldierlike speech. -

THIE STATE OF NAPLES.
(FROM OUR OWir CORRESPONDEN-T.)
NAPLES, Fan. 14.
I observe that Lord Clarendon's speech in the House of Lords enumerates what he carls certain measures of concession which have been made by the King of the Two Sicilies. I have repeatedly endeavoured to show that the Argentine Treaty, illegal and unjust in its action, simply provided a commutation of punishment from irons in prison to perpetual exile. As to the Commissions, they are still without life, and of the probability of their productiveness you may judge from this fact, that in September, 1855, Signor Arpino, appointed Plenipotentiary by thi3s Lovernment to draw up the Treaty between the United States and the Two Sicilies, declared to the United States' Miinister to the following effect :-That His Majesty wished it to be made known to him, and, through him, to his Govermnent, that the Scala Franca was again to be introduced, and that arrangements were made for the erection of the bonding warehouses. Nothing as yet has been done. No one here has any faith in promises, and in judging of Naples you must not erect an ordinary standard. My firm opion is still that all classes from the highest to the lowest are so demoralized that regeneration from within is an impossibility. Counsels will not be listened to, for one reason among others, that they cannot be followed out. The most hopeless state of a nation is when a despot is the slave of his own slaves, and when a continuance in misgovernment is the necessary condition of self-preservation. Be assured that the entire country is on its back, and cannot rise without the assistance of some friendly hand. Will France and England who have talked so much lend that hand? I understand that the Russian and Prussian Ministers here, while praising the firmness of the King, have urged concessions, and intimated that a reconciliation might be effected if His Majesty would yield certain points. The praisehas been accepted and the counsel rejected, and rumour asserts that within the last few days the King's determination to maintain his position is stil stronger. The words used to me are that the hopes that existed two or three days since of a change have ceased, for His Majesty is greatly irritated against France. Judging from aw pearances, a desire of conciliation has never honestly been maintained, for, since the Legations left Naples, the most insulting and abusive publications have been distributed by the police under the very eye of the Censor. The last publication of this kind is an attack on England, so full of absurdities that, were it not for its malignity, it would not deserve a moment's notice. Thus, Captain Farquhar, of the Malacca is accused of having distributed powder and munitions of waramong the people, and theWanderer of having landed emigrants in Malta, upon the Sicilian coast. Every one who has treated intimately with Captain Farquhar must be aware of the scrupullous delicacywith which he has acted so as not to give offience to thisGovernment and to observe the strictest neutrality. I believe his only public interference here was to save 23 men from the wreck of the Carlo Terzo, which was not acknowledged by the official journal until a week after, and then in the coldest manner, while the report was circulated about the Court that the explosion had been caused by the crew of the Malacca. I note these circumstances only to show that the animus entertained towards our Government is of the worst possible character, and that while counsel invites insult, and delicacy and vacillation awaken abuse, firmness only will command that respectful consideration which may be the means of averting great calamities. The pamphlet alluded to above, and which, as some people tell me, was first presented in the form of a note to the Russian and Prussian Governments, alludes to the political prisoners in Monte Sachio as being under the peculiar protection of England. Poerio is called a regicide and Settembrini a Muratist. This allusion gives me the opportunity of reasserting what has been denied by an insignificant portion of the foreign press, that Poerio and his felow prisoners wore chains. This fact was stated in your columns last summer, and it was stated moreover that Alfonso Zeuli, who was dying of consumption, still wore a chain. These facts are again asserted on evidence that fears no denial. Zeuli no longer wears it, for death has liberated him. The Austrian Minister, I am credibly informed, has remonstrated, and expressed his surprise that no notice has been taken in the official journal of the Austrian amnesty. The same journal, however, still fnds room nightly to publish a catalogue of the addresses of congratulation said to be pouring in from all parts of the country on the preservation of His Majesty. The following facts have lcd to a correspondence this week between Mr. Owen, the United States' Minister, and the Government. Some two years since a man named Ignazio Laurio caled on Mr. Owen and asserted his claim to some bounty land in America, as having served as musician on board an American vessel in the war of 1812. In the absence of proofs of his personal identity he was recommended by the Minister to go on board every American vessel, and endeavour to find some one who could recognize him. This he has done ever since, though in vainLast week he went on board theSusquehannah,ascertained that he had served in the same vessel with the captain, who was convinced by a detail of facts that the man's story was true, and gave him a certificate to that effect.
The Archduchess Sophia Of Austria.-
TIrE ABcImucnFss SoPHTA oF AUSTRIA.- There is no fact better known in Ireland than the circnmstance that for more than a century the Imperial House of Austria has counted among its favourites Irishmen, or the descendants of Irishmen, wlho have devoted themselves to its service. Not long since the illustrious soldier, Field-Marshal Nugent, a friend of the Duke of Wellington, was a visitor at the Vere ILodge. Field-Marshal Nugent was an Irishman, and, lke the great Generals Brown and Brady, had risen from a cadetship to the highest rank in the Austrian army. But a few years since the life of the present Emperor, Francis Joseph, was saved from the knife of an assassin by the devoted bravery of the young O'Donnell, an Irishman by descent. We are gratified in being able to state that proof has recently been afforded in the case of a fellow-citi7en that the friendly feelings of the Imperial family of Austria remain as strong and unimpaired as ever. In this case the kindliness has been manifested not for services by the sword, but the pen. Mr. WiUiam Bernard M'Cabe, wleU known in Dublin and in London by his career as a journalist, published last year a volume entitled Ade.tads, Queen of IZly, and as that work dealt with historical ever.ts which occurred in the 10th century, showing the early connexion of the German empire with Lormbardy, and as he conceived there was a resemblance between the conduct of Queen Adelaide and of the Archduchess Sophia, the mother of the present Emperor, he applied for and obtained pcrmnission to dedicate his last work to the Archduchess. Hofv highly his book was approved at the Court of Vienna is shown by the folowing letter, which was received within the last few davs by Mr. WCabe .-

3.ATP.UAc.FS IN IRBLAND.-The sixth report of the Registrar.General of M[arriages in Ireland appeaied in print on Saturday. The following is a brief summary of its sitatistical details :-In the year 1855 (the last reported) there v.ere S765 marriagesin Ireland, against 9,426in 185 1; 10.197 in 1833, 9,4S7 in 1852, 9,339 in 1851, and 9,781 in
,. Tis is equivalent to a reduction of 7 per cent. as compared with 1854. Of the 8,765 marriages registercd in 1855, 4,922 were solemnized according to the rites of the church (3,867 by license, L002 by banns, and 20 _y registrar's certificates), and 3,843 not accordlug to the rites of the church as by lawestablished. These is a continuous and marked decrease in the numbers married (according to the rites of the established church) by registrars' certificates. It is remarkable that the deerease in the number of marriages is confined to Ulster, an increass having occurred in Leinster, Connaulght, and Munster. The married of 1855 included 405 males and 1,551 females under age, 1,163 widowers and 610 widows, and 2,260 men and 3,674 women who were too iUiterate to sign their names, and who conseanently were obliged to " miake their marks." 781 hcenses ror'-arriages were granted by districb registrars in 1855, and the nunber of persons married in the registrars' ffcee amountedto 1,316.

The VICE-CHANCELLOR. Upon inspcoting the books thought that the terms in one instance had very much the tendency of an assent of the directors to a transfer proposed to be made.
Mrx. GLAssE resumed, and referred to the acts necessary to complete a transfer. Transfers were made in blank, as 'was often th case in other concerns, to evado the stamp, and shares passing from one to the other, the form was at last filled up. In substance the asent of the directors had bever been waived; there had been a recognition in each transaction. The learned counsel then prooeded to takne a aeview of the cases, which, he submitted, supported the official manager's view when they were carefully considered.

The VICE-CHARCELLOR, at the conclusion of the reply, said that before he gave his opinion upon the summonses he must be furnished with the affidavits atod evidence, and perhaps the solicitors would be good enough to invefstiate the beaks, and elcit and select therefrom te instances in which assent and disent had been given by the directors.

The YiaCHE-CIIAoZLL directed it to stand. over, in order that the trustees of the settlement iight have an opportunity of examining witnesses before the examiner of the Court, with the view of showing whether the plaintiff was inforined that the deed was to contain any such covenant, and whether he asented to it, and If so, what was the amount intended to have been inserted in the covenant.

(SiWings at Nisi P7-iw, jbJutvLord OCAPELL and
a Special Turg?.)
Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Holl appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Digby for the dePendants.
The plaintiff in this action, W. F. Butler, was a rag merchant and paper manufacturer, and he sued the Great Western Rallway Company to recover the sum of 111, being the value of 43 bags of papers sent by the plaintiff by the Great Western ailvway to the Maidenhead station, and there to be delivered to the plaintiff's order, but which were lost to the plaintiff by being misdelivered to another party. It appeared that on the 18th of September 1,356, the plaintiff sent 43 bags of papers to the defendants with these directions:-
" To the Goods Manager, Crutched-friars,-Please receive and forward to the Maidenhead station 43 bags of papers to my order. "W. F. BLTTLER."
The plaintiff's object was that the papers should be delivered to Mr. Milbourne, a paper manufacturer at Bray, three miles from Maidenhead, to be by him manufactured into paper. Eilbourne had undertaken to manufacture the plaintiff's rags into paper and to charge him at the rate of 321. a-ton, which he agreed to set off against a debt owing by him to the plaintiff. The plaintiff sent down an order to Milbourne for him to receive the goods, but, according to the plaintiff's evidence, no steps were taken b Milbourne to obtain the goods. Mickley, the landlord of the mill, who was in the habit of going to the Maidenihead station every day to fetch goods for Milbourne, obtained the bags from the station, but without presenting any order for their delivery. The plaintiff went down to Maidenhead in two or three days, and saw the goods lying in Milbourne's yard, and ascertained that Mickley had got them from the company, but he made no complaint against the company at that time. He said he should bring an action againstthe company, but, in fact, he made an agreement with Mickley that he (Micklay) should have the goods and pay for them; but Mickley did not carry out his agreement. The plaintiff then obtained judgment for his debt against Milbourne, and put in execution, and seized the goods. The landlord, Mickley, also put in a distress for rent, and the goods were sold. The plaintiff, at the end of October, made his claim against the company for misdelivering the goods, and brought the present action.
At the close of the plaintiff's case,
Mr. BoVILL, for the defendants, ask-ed his Lordship whether there was any case.
Lord CAIIPBELL said he thought there was abundant evidence that the plaintiff had recognized the delivery of goods to Milbourne. The plaintiff had seen the goods in the yard without any order, but he made no complaint against the c.vmpany. OU the contrary, he agreed with MIickley that Mickley should pay ior the goods; and it was only after Midkley had refused to pay that he made any complaint against the company, and that not till the end of October. His Lordship said ho shou d ask the jury whether the plaintiffhad not acquiesced in the delivery to Milbousne withoat an order.
The jurv, with but oneexception, all agreed that the plaintiff had so acquiesced, and ratified the delivery. As the dissentient juryman still held out,
Mr. BOVILL said he would call a witness who would prove that the goods were delivered to the plaintiff's order. Thb learned counsel then called Mickley's carman, who stated that he had received a verbal order from Milbourne to go and fetch the goods, but that he did not take the written order.
Mr. CHANiDERS stiUl contended that there was no intention on the part of the plaintiff to ratify the delivery.
Lord CAMMPRELL, in summing up the evidence, said the question of ratification would not now arise, for it was no.w proved that the goods were delivered to the order of a person-Mdilbourne-who, defacao, had authority to receive themn. His Lordship directed the jury that that was ust the same as if ALilbourne had gone personaUy and received the goods.
The dissentient jurymnan again rose, and said he could not atree with his brother jurymen unless his Lordship said that nm point of law th1ere was a distinction between an order for tlie payent of 1,0001., and an order for the d,liver *,f gOl-.. In the case of a monetary transac'ion, ho should not pay the money without tho written order, and, as these goods were to be delivered to the written order of the plaintiff, lie thought the company ought not to have delivered the goods.
Lord CAMPsiF.LL again told the jury that if the company delivered the goods to a persort authorized by Milbourne to receive them it was the same as if they had delivered them to Milbourme himself; and that if they so delivered them. and Alilbourne had, in fact, the written authority of the plaintiff to receive thuem, the company had discharged their duty.
The juryanan said ho should bow to his Lordship's decision as a matter of course.
The jury then found a verdict for the defendant.
,Mr. BOVILL. applied for a certificate for a special jury.
Lord CAX'1nBELL said he thought the action might have been tried just as well by a common jury, and refused the applicatiom.
Vn11TBOURNE (ASSIG2;EE) V. BELL.
MIr. Bovill, Q-C.. and Mr. Mdilward appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. James, Q.C., and Ix. Rodwell for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action was the assignee of an insolvent named Edward Bell, and he sued the defendant, James

It appeared that the late Mr. BelI a fish factor in Thames-streot, had given up his business to his son, Jaiue3 Bell, the defendant, upon deed being executed thereby the defendant wasof 1001. among his fu rtesadases n of the brothers, Edwr Belha bcoeisvnt and in June, 1856, his share of the annuity was put upf sale by Mr. Marsh, at the Aucton Mart The defondanto the day of the sale wrote a letter to the aucetioneer requestin him to state publicly that the validity of the arnnmty *v
disputed. The defendant got a friend to attend the sale, and through him purchased the one-fourth of the annuitws viz., 25?. for 1f55?, the fair marketable value of the nropelG being, according to Mr. Mlarsh's7 evidence, at least 19. Tin allegation was that the defendant had acted maliciously, and in order that he might purchase the annuity at a reduced
The defence was that the validity of the annuity wras in fact disputed, and that the defendant had made two pay. ments under protest. It appeared that the family had had a good deal of litigation, and had been in Chancery; but as to the payments under protest it appeared that the defendant had also made other payments without making any protest or objection.
Lord CAMPBELL, in summing up, said it was incumbent on the plaintiff to p ove that the defendant had acedb meltd fide. If the vali'dity of the annuity was not really disputed, and if the object of the defendant in writing the letter was that he maight purcase the property at a lower price, the plaintiff vrould bie entitled to ao verdict.
The jury found for the plaintiff-Damages, 351.
Lord CA5-IPnELL expressed his concu-rxence in the verdict, and ad that if the defendant had not meant to be a purchaser the letter would not have been written.
GOLDICUTrV. WRIGHT.
fr. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr Field appeared lhe plaintiff, and Mr. Hawlins for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action, W W. Goldicutt, was a young man living at home with his mother at Fulham, and be sued the de endant another young man, named R. Wright, to rocover the sunm of 221 IUs. 7d. upon two I O I'. The defendant as to the first I U U, which was dated the 7th of July, 1855, and wus for 81. 7s. lld., pleaded that it was given for money lost at gaming and as to the other I0 U, which was dated the Ith of August, 1855, andawas for 121., he pleadedI a set-off.
The plaintiff havin proved hisprimd facd ecase,
Robert Wright, to e defendant, was called, an)dated thath hatheplaintiff hadbecomevery intimatefromsbeing fellow clerks at the Law Union Fire-office. Iu the suhtoer of 1855 they agreed to go together to Chalk-farm to play at cricket for a sovereign a game.
Lord CAMPBELL observed that Chalk-farm bad lost its custom. (LAughter.)
Mr. HAWKINs said that ini former times thero was a large beard with the words " Rubbish may be shot here."P (Laughter.)
The defendant said he lost two sovereigns at cricket, and he afterwards lost three sovereigns to the plaintiff atbilliards That was on Saturday, the 23d of June. On the 25th of June he lost a further sum of 11.s 7d. at the Palace Stores, in Pall-mall. These sums added to a sum of 31., which he lost on a bet against a horse at Newmarket, called the Lord of the Isles, maide up the sum of 81. Us. 7d. for which the first IOU wasgiven on the 7t of July. The otherlIO0U for 21. was given on the plaintiff advancing 101. to the defendant for getting the plaÂ°intiff a situation at Mr. Avens's, the defendant's uncle, hut which the plaintiff agreed defendant should retain as a remuneration for his itance, in case the plaintiff remained a reasonable time with Mr. Avens. On crosstexamination w the defendant saiahe had been a clerk at "the Unity," but left, and that he haa "resigned"at the "LawUnion."1 Headmittedhavingwritten a letter to the plaittiff's solicitor, who oad applied for the sum now demanded, and that he had writtn these words m-
If I had the neeaful the debt should be discharged at once." The defendant's evidence was confirmed by two young men, Hughes and Thurston, also clerks in the Law Union, who spted that they had accompanie athe plaintiff and defendant to Chalkn-farh, to play at cricket, at a sovereign a-game, and that the plaintiff and defendant afterwards plaT,ed at billiards.
lhe plaintiff, W. W. Goldicutt, was then cled to contradiet the defendant's evidence, and swore positively that the I 0 U was given to him by the defendant for money lent at various times, and that no part of it was for money lost either at cricket or billiards. im said he had never asked the defendant for the 21. which he won from th m at cricket. He denied that he had played at billiards at all. It was at pool at which several peple played. As to the I0 U for 12. he swore positived bthat he har never made tho defendant the promise alleged, btt that the defendant, when begot his situation at the Unity, told hiw that he had been annoyed by his tailor, and s
aLfraid he should lose his situation, and wanted to borrow 101. Upon this the plaintiff said he lent hinm 101. at a coffeehouse in Old Jewry. The plaintiff's brother, J. A. Goldicutt, was also called and confirmed the plaintiff's evidence as to the advance of the 101., which he saw handed over.
Lord CAnsrPBrnL in summing Up sad it WaS a painful eight to see young mien, clerks in the city, imitating practices common at the west-end of the town, and then coming
into the witness-box and contradicting on nther upon
their oaths as they had done to-day. iLOrdhp then left it to the jury to say whether the defendant had proved his pleas.
The jury fouLnd for the plaintiff on the issue as to thel2l.; but for the defendant, on the plea that the I 0 U for 8?. Uls. 7d. was given in respect of gaming transactions.

This was an action brought for injuries inflicted on the plaintiff's wife by the furious driving of a servant in charge of the defendant's cart.
It appeared that the plaintiff, an upholsterer and house agent at Sydenham, was driving his wife in a four-wheel chaise in Camden-grove, Peck-ham, in August last, when the accident happened. The lady's leg and ankle were much injured, and the plaintiff claimed compensation for the injuries to his chaise, and the expenses resulting from the loss of his wife's services, and for medical expenses.
No question was made as to the negligent conduct of the defendant's servant, but the defendant denied that the damages exceeded in amount the sum of 251., which he had paid into court.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with 251. additional damages.
COLY'LUS V. LAW.
Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., Mr. Serjeant Parry, and Mr. Doyle appeared for the plaintiff; and Mtr. Serjeant BaUan. tine and Air. Honyman were counsel for the defendant.
This was an action of libel brought by the plaintiff against the defendant, the publisher of the LW-rai-iu7n, or kducational Gasette.
The cirommstances of this case were as follows:-The plaintiff, who wasagradnateof the Universityof Oxford,and nad also been entered as a student of Lincoln's-inn, and had latterly been an assistant-master of Bray Collegiate School, and of the North London Collegiate School, and, under the belief that great evil resulted not only to the public but to the class of teachers in general by the employment of ",scholastic agents," who were in general illiterate men, and whose charges were also high, formed the design of founding a central agency office, where persons wishful. of obtaining situations as teachers or schoolmasters might register themselves, and obtain such situations under more favourable terms, and with greater advantages, both to themselves and the public, than those offered by the present system of scholastic agency. The plaintiff accordingly proceeded, in the early part of last year, to form such central office, in conjunction with a gentleman named Tacon, a former associate in scholastic duties, and, with the assistance of Mr. Tacon's father, who advanced 1001. for the purpose of carrying out the scheme. It bore the name or the " Institute of Schoolmasters, " and the names of Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Brougham, Lord John Russell, and Sir John l'akington were obtained on application to act as patrons of the undertaking, and those of several gentlemen-clergymen of the established church and other gentlemcn engaged in educational pursuits-were also obtained to act as a committeo in carrying the proposed scheme into execution. The plaintiff was to be manager, and Tacon the secretary of the institute. Business connected with the undertaking was at first carried on in Arundel-street, Strand, and afterwards at 188, Strand. After this differences took place between the plaintiff and Tacon, and the plaintiff removed and conducted the affairs of the institute at 17, BosweUl-court, Tacon still continuing at 188, Strand and continuing to act as secretary, retaining the old name of the undertaking, but afterwards changing it for another. Shortly after this Tacon went through the Insolvent-court, plaintiff still continuing to conduct the management of the concern, and issuing prospectuses from his offbees hin Baswehl.court.
The libel complained of was contained in an article in the Littrarsussn of the 19th of November last, headed " Insolvency of Horace R. Tacon," and in the course of which many severe reflections were made upon the insolvent, and upon the plaintiff as connected with him and with the mnanagement of the "Institute of Schoolmasters." The libel was very lengthy, but the portions complained of contained strong observations on the " fraud," " duplicity," and " misrepresentation" of the persons connected with the iustiteto, charging them and the plaintiff with publishing specious advertGsements" of the scheme, and deceiving the puublc as to the circumstances attending the appointment of the noblemen and gentlemen named as patrons and committeelnen.
The defendant did not deny the publication of the libel, but justified it as being true in fact, or, at all events, a fair discussion of s matter affecting the interests of the public.
The plaintiff and several gentlemen, members of the committee of the Institute of Schoolmasters, were called and examiined, but nothing very material was elicited from them to show that the plaintiff had used any gross decjption in representing the scheme to the public, though ifas admitted that some portions of the advertismcnt iss-T by the plaintiff were not strictly correct; and it was not shown by what representations the gentlemen named as " patrons" had allowed their nanmesto be so used.
Mr. Justice WVILLSES, after generally stating the law of libel as applicable to this ca.ce, and observing uwpon the right of the public press to advert to any matter of public interest in terms of fair criticism, left the mnatter in the hands of
the)uxy. for the defendant.

SATURDAY, FE. 2L
(Sittings in Banco, before Barons BRAB5WELL, WATSON,
and CHANNFE.)
The Court sat to-day, pursuant to notice, to deliver judgments.*The following aloneofseveralcauses called for a special report, andthat, from its general importance, we subjoin in extenso:-
THE GUARDIANS OF THIE POOR OF LICEPIELD UNION V.
WILLLt GREXEX.
Mr. Baron BRIBVWELL said, this was a special case for the opinion of the Court under the provisions of the Common Law Procedure Aot(1S52) and the question was whether the defendant is liable to pay the whole or any portion of a sum of 2991. 19g. 8d? In 1851 one Richard Greene was appointed treasuer of the Lichfield Union, aud thereupon he and the defendant and another gentleman, as his sureties, entered into a bond to the plaintiffs. The condition of the bond recited the appointmenit of Richard Greene in the namner prescribed by the rules and regulations of the Poor Law Board, and, among other things, contained a stipulation that Richard Greene should "- honestly, diligently, and faithfully perform and discharge the duties of his offlice." One of the duties prescribed by the General Consolidated Orders of the Poor Law Commissioners was, " ' to pay out of any money for the time being in his hands, belonging to the guardians, all orders for money which should be drawn upon him, in conformity with article 84, when the same should be presented for payment at the house or usual place of business of this treasurer." Mr. Richard Greene was a hanker at Iachfield, and carried on business under the name of " Palmer and Greene." On Friday, the 28th of December, 1855, the plaintiffs drew several orders for mRoney in the proper form, and delivered them to their clerk for the purposes of the union. Souae of them were presented for payment at the bank on that day, and paid.partlyin cash and the residue in 51. banknotes of the bank, being ordinary country banknotes, dated Lichfeld, payable to bearer on demand at Lichfield, or at Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith's, London. The bank stopped payment at 8 'clock p.m. of 1fonday, the 31st of December, at which time there were in the hands of the patiffs 951. of these3 banknotes. On the 31st of Decem )er, about 11 o'lock a.m., an officer of the union presented other orders at the hank, and was p aid partly in casb, and the residue in 2001. of similar banknotes. All these were either never parted with, or were returned to the plaintiffs after the stoppage by the persons to whom they were paid. The remainng claim of 41. 19s. 8d. arose thus: -An order in the same form as the others had been drawn by the plaitiffs in favour of some persons in London, and on the 31st of December the clerks of the plaintiffs took it to the bank, and received in exchange a common banker's draught to the same amount upon Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith's, payable on demand. This was presented after the stoppage, and dishonoured, and returned to the plaintiffs. chard Greene w-as declared bankrupt on the 1st of January. At the time of the presentment of the above orders he had in his hands sufficient maoney of the plaintiffs to pay them. The plaintiffs have called upon the defendant to pay the sum of 2991 l8s, 8d., alleging that he was liable to do so by virtue of the bond. The defendant denies his liability, and this is the question we are called upon to decide. Upon behalf of theplaintiffsitvwasargued that it was the duty of Rlichard Greene to pay the orders, and that the delvering by him of his own promissory notes, which were afterwards not paid, was no payment, and the case was likened to the payment of a debt by a bill of exchange, or promissory note afterwvards dishonoured, under which eircumstances it was stated to be clear and admitted law that the creditor could sue for the original debt. On the other hand, it was argued on behalf of the defendant that this was not a payment by a bill of exchange or promissory note, as ordinarily understood, but a payment by banknotes, which were treated as money or cash, both by the party paying and the party receiving; that the clerk or officer of the plaintiffs might, if he thought fit, have insisted on being paid in gold or in notes of the Bank of England, and that he having elected to be paid in the manner in vwhich he was, could not, after the stoppage of the bank, repudiate it, and insist that it was not payment as against the defendant as surety. It seems to be clear that a bankncte is not to be considered in all respects at least as a bill of exchange or promissory note payable at a distant date. In M'ller v. Race" (I Burrows, 452), Lord Mansfield says "Banknotes are not goods, nor securities or docunients for debts, nor are they so esteemed; but are treated as money or cash in the ordinary courTe and transaction of business by the general consent of mankind, which gives them the credit and currency of money to all intents and purposes. They are as much money as guineas themselves are, or any other current coin that is used in common payments as money or cash. They are never considered a secmurities for money, but as money itself; on payment of them, where a receipt is required, the receipts are always given as for money, not as for securities or notes." Banknotes are also treated of and dealt with in a variety of acts of Parliamnent (the Bank Acts and others), and restrictions put upon their issue and form. In England, practically, they cannot be issued for a less sum than 51., but it is notorious that in Scotland and Ireland :ocal or country 11. banknotes form the great bulk of the ordinary currency of the country and are in universal use. Bank of England notes are now a legal tender for all sums above 51., except at the Bank of England and its branches, and country banknotes are also a legal tender, unless objected to at the time on that account. (Bytes con Bills, p. 7.) It seems, therefore, clear that banknotes are in many respects different from hills of exchange and promissory notes ordinarily so called. The question asto the effect of payment by banknotes when the bank either has stopped at the time of payment. or shortly after, has been fi equently the subject of legal discussion, and the case of * Camidge v. Allenby" (6 B. and C., 373) seems to contain the existimg law upon the subject. In that casea distinction was taken between a payment by banknotes at the time of the sale, or of the original transaction, and a payment by bank-notes on a pre-existing debt. Mr. Justice Bayley says-" If the notes had been given to the plaintiff at the time when the corn was sold he could have had no remedy upon them against the defendant. The plaintiffmighthave insisted upon payment in money, but if he consented to receive the notes as money they would have been tAken by him at his peril. If, indeed, he could showr fraud or knowledge of the maker's insolvencyin the prayer, then it would be inmmaterial whether they vwere taken at the time of the sale or afterwards." But Mr. Justice Holroyd and Mr. Justice Littledale both seem to be of opinion that, if country banks,otes are paid and received as money in any transaction as payment, and both parties be innocent, it is payment. The latter learned judge expreEsly says that in his opinion there is no guarantee by the party passing a note payable on demand to bearer that the maker of the note is solvent at the time when it was so passed. It has been already stated what, in the opinion of Mr. Jnstice Bayley, is the effeet of payment by banknotes at the time of the transaction or sale; but in the san e case it is said by the same learned judge, that if a man takes bank notes in payment of a pre-existing debt, and the bank stops the following day, he is entitled at once to return the notes and treabthem as non-payment. So, also, if he circulates them on or before the following day, and they are returned to him by a person entitled to return them by reaSon of the stoppage of the bank, his right to returr, them to his
eebtr stt cotlrunes. (:ee also /'yles on BzUs, p. 154 )
N1o case has arisen like the present, where the person paying was the maker of the banknote himself ; but, as to the transaction on Friday, the 28th, the case of the payer not being the maker seems to afford an analogy. If Mr. R. Greene had uaid the orders by banknotes of another hank in Lichfieldv which had stopped on Monday, the 31st, tbe payment by him would have been good, according to the case of " Cansidge v. Allenby." The circumstance of these notes not hvaving been presented for payment, or circulated by thqj3intit s on the Saturday, would have made it a good pay t by R. Greene, a,,d tie loss would have fa]len on the plaintiffs, and we think that, in analogy to *his, the plaintiffs having kept is their posFession during Satuiday the 951., they thereby conclusivOly elected to ireat the orders as pai(l, anid tlh;at the sureties have a right to treat the transaction as pay,ment. The payinent on Monday is olbsitusly not ithin this principle, for the bank 6 topped pap in,t-t about 3 o'clock of
that day ; but both paynments, viz., that oni tbe Friday and that on the Monday seenm to be 'within the principle laid down by Mr. Justice Bayley in respect of pa3 in-nts made by banknotes at the time of the sale or transaotion, unless
the circumstance that the person paying was also the maker. of the notes causes a difference. The liability to pay created by the bond, or condition, was to do so upon the orders being presented for payment. Immediately upon being praeneted they were paid, and, therefore, according t; the above prnmple, the banknotes were taken at the peril of the plaintiff, and we think the circumstance of Mr. R. Greene being the maker is immaterial, for the plaintiffs have the right to prove against his estate to the amounb of the notes; and we are of opinion that the obligation of the defendant being that R. Greene should, upon the presentment of the orders, pay them, when the plaintiffs, who were entitled to insist upen receiving sovereigns or Bank of England notes thought fit to receive the banknotes, the obligation of the defendant was thereby satisfied and discharged. As to the 41. 19s. 8d., the plaintiffs' clerk, having it in his power to demand cash, received for the plaintiffs' convenience a draught upon London, in order to make the payment there. We think this discharged the sureties upon the principle of "Vernon v. Bouverie." (6 B. & C., 160.) We are therefore of opinion that the defendaut is not liable to pav the whole or any portion of the sums in question, and that the plalntiffs' remedy is confined to a proof upon the notes and bill against the estate of R. Greene, the bankrupt.

THE Nisi PRIus COURT.-(BeforC MAr. Justice CROMPTOS
arnd a Specid Jury.)
IIOYLE V. IIOLDEN.
This was an action brought by Mr. John Hoyle, a magistrate of the county of Laneaster, against Mr. Ralph Holden, also a magistrate of the county, for an assault. The damages were laid at 2001. The defendant pleaded " Not guilty," and also that the plaintiff had first assaulted him, and that he assaulted the plaintiff in his own defence. The plaintiff replied by now assigning that the assault was in excess, to which the defendant rejoined that he was "Not guilty."
Mr. Overend, Q.C., Mr. Crosse, and Mr. Blair apParfed for the plaintiff; and Mr. James, Q.C., and Mr. Kayfor the defendant.
It appeared from the opening statement of the learned counsel, and from the evidence for the plaintiff, that the plaintiff and the defendant are both magistrates of the county, residing at Haslingden, and that they were both in the habit of attending the pettysessions at Haslingden. On the 3d of October last the plaintiff and defendant were the two justices present when an application was made by a woman named Marshall, who had several children, and whose husband was confined as a lunatic, for the renewal of a hlense to be granted to a pablichouse kejt by her, which had been suspended because of its basing been reported to the justices that she had allowed some persons to toss for a quart of beer in her house. The plaintiff, on that occasion, was in favour of renewing the heense and giving the woman another trial, on account of her nnfortunate position. The defendant was opposed to it, as there had been frequent complaints of the house. In consequence the hearing was adjourned to the following day for the attendance of other magistrates, and next day, Saturday, the 4th of October, at S o'clock in the evening, Mlr. Henry Salter and the Rev. Mr. Mordzcque, two other magistrates, were requested to attend. The applicant, three polcemen, Mr. Hindle, the magstrates' clerk, and thefour magistrates were then present. r Mordacquethen concurredwith the plaintiff, that thelicense ought to be granted, and Mr. Salter concurred with the defendant, that the license ought to be refused, and, being senior magistrate present and in the chair, he gave the casting vote for refusing the license, and then descended from the bench, which was a kind of platform raised two feet from the floor, and said, " Well, I suppose the conmmission is over." Mr. Hoyle (tbe plaintiff) then stood up, and, according to his own evidence, took a shiUing from bis pocket and put it down on the desk before him under his hand saying, " I see no more harm in two poor men tossing for a pint of beer than in a magistrate tossing for damages done to his land, or for land." Mr. Holden said, " What magistrate did toss for land'e' Mr. Hoyle replied, at the same time pointing at Mr. Holden with his finger, " You, Sir; you, Sir; and Mr, Iiindle there was a witness." lfr. Holden, without uttering another word, raised his stick, which was formed of a Ithn rod of steel, and struck hLr. Hoyle a violent blow across the shoulder; and from the effects of that blow Mr. Hoyle fell back on the platform. It appeared that the deiendant had settled a difference about some land which the Boxy and Radcliffe Waterworks had taken by " tossing" up whether he should take the price offered him or have the full amount he asked. The plaintiff, after the blow, -was taken up in a fainting state. He did not speak in an excited way. On being cross-examined, the
laintiff denied that he had said to the defendidnt, be. fore the blow, "By G--, you are a scoundrel." But he admitted that he had said, after the blow, "b he had heard of Haslingden that it was to be g".verned by a cotton weaver and a chambermaid." He said this in reference to Mr. Hindle, the clerk, and to the defendant, who had married a chambermaid. The plaintiff was confined to his bed for a week from the effects of the blow. The evidence was corroborated ty the Rev. Mr. Mordacque, one of the magistrates present, who, however, admitted that be was under pecuniary obligations to the plaintiff, who was his landlord.
For the defendant Mr. Slater, another of the magistrates present, stated that the plaintiff, at the time described, had gesticulated violently, and had replied, when asked " Wh, tossed for land?' "You did, Sir, and it is a piece of rascality," Fhaking his fist violently in the defendant's fee, who instantly struck him and knocked him down, as stated.
The defendant, on being examnined, admitted that he struck the blow, because he was notaccustotned to be called names, and felt indignant at the plaintiff sbaking his fist in his face. The plaint:ff, as soon as he was raised up, said, " You are a d- scoundrel, and I will serve you with a writ
t.-morrow, by G-." The defendant said, ."Not to-morrow,
r. IHoyIe,-zo-morraw is Snnday." The plaintiff then left theroom.
The defendant, whose appearance, demeanour, snd quiet mnanner in the -witness-box were those of a gentlemsn, created a very favourable impression in the Court while under examination.
The defendaans couvsel, regretting that the matter had been brought before the public, contended that the insult offered to the defendant by the plaintiff shaking his fist in his face and calling him a scoundrel justified the defendant in striking him on the instant the blow he bad done.
The learned counsel for the plaintiff baving replied,
The learned JUDGEr, in summing up, said the matter was a very painful one to inquire into and discreditable to both parties. He left it to the jury to say, Â£rst, whether an assault had been committed; and secondly, whether an assault had been committed by the plaintiff; and whether the assault by the defendant had been in excess and more than sufficient to protect the defendant from the plaintiff's assault. On the question of damages, if they gave any, they must consider all the circumstances and the provocation received by the defendant.
The jury retired, and after an absence of half an hour found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 40s.
His LoRDFsm' refused to certify for costs.
There still remains one civil action to try, which is an ordinary action on a contract ; and one indictment for perjury, in the Crown court to-morrow, which will finish the snsies.

The prosecutrix, the wife of n engineer at the General Post-os"ce, stated that on the 25th of January she was at Dr. Cumming's Chapel, in Crown-court, and the prisoner was placed in the same pear. She pushed against wstness so hard that she had to thrust her away, and immediately afterwards she missed her purse from a pocket in that side of her dress nearest to the prisoner.

SATURDAY, Fn. 21.
(Before Mr. PAsHLv'y, Q.O., AssistantJudge.)
Frederick Goodwin, the boy who pleaded guilty on Wed. nesday, of having thrown a brick at the express train on theLondonaudNorth-Western Pailway, was brought up tor judgment.
The prisoner's father stated, that when the offence was cominitted he the prisoner) was in a situation as errand boy, and a gentleman had now undertaken to give him a permanent place which would take him entirely out of the country. e could not teUl for what motive the prisoner committed the act, he had always had a good example set him, and but for adverse circumstances he would not have been sent out in the world at so early an age.
The AsssmTAsNTJuDGX said, he had regarded this az so very serious an offence that he had taken time to consider what sentence to pass. The sentence must be one to intimidat others from committing a like crime, and he thought it right to say, that an adult person would have been punished with the utmost severity for such an offence; indeed, with an indictment rather differently worded a prisoner so convicted might be sentenced to transporta tion for life. Under the present indictment the prisoner was liable to two years' smprisonment, but he did not see any occasion to award tbat term, in the event of a repetition of the offence the offender would be dealt with most severely. 'Under the present circumstances he should sentence the prisoner to tbree months bard labour, the first and last weeks to be solitary.
Thomas Rogers, 53, a begging-letter impostor, convicted of obtaining 20s fraudulently from Henry Thomas, was sentenced to 18 months' hard labour.

MANSION-1-OUTSE.-Mr. Wooltorton and several other guardiansof the West London Union attendedfor the pur. pose of making a representation to the LORD MAYOR upon the subject of the honseless poor.
Mr. Wooltorton said that a statement had appeared in the papers of Friday last to the effect that the Lord Mfayor, the Recorder, and other gentlemen had vsited the casual ward of the West London Union on the Wednesday night preceding, where they found the inmates of the ward without either beds orl straw upon which to lie. Mr. Wooltorton, in the course of a lengthened statement, in which he said that the rules as carried out at the union had been approved by the Poor Law inspector on the occasion of his visits to the establishment, concluded by stating that the ward which the Lord Mayor had been shown was only used for the lodging of tramps, and not able bodied and regular poor, who had suitable accom. modation provided for them, the tramps being persons of such filthy and disgusting habits that fever and disease would be likely to result from their being supplied with bedding and mattremses.
The LoBD MAYOR said, he had seen the paragraph in the newspapers to which reference had been made, the particulars contaiaed in it being perfectly correct. As a ma,istrate, and having many applications made to him daily by the destitute poor for shelter and food, he had felt it his bounden duty to visit the unions for the purpose of seeing how the casual poor were treated there. He strongly deprecated the existing practice of sending the destitute several miles from the unions for food and shelter, when they were in a state of starvation and unable to undertake the journey. He wa5 both sorry and surprised to find that the regulations at present in existence had been sanctioned by the Poor Law Commissioners.
Mr. Wooltorton thanked the Lord Mayor for the courtesy with which he had received the guardians, and withdrew.
Mr. Coleman, secretary to the Houseless Poor Institution at 75, Old Broad-street, said he wished it to be made known to the public that this establishment was not the one visited by the Lord Mayor on Wednesday night, an impression in some quarters having existed that it was.
BOW-STRER.-Henry hMilward West, a sorter in the General Post-office, was charged with stealing a letter containing 2s. under the following circumstances :-Smee, the Post-office constable, stated that at about 7 o'clock that morning he was on duty on the basement story of the Postoffice. He was stationed at a " peephole," so constructed as to command the whole length of the waterclosets used by the letter carriers and sorters. He saw the prisoner examining a letter, which he struck against his hand, as if to knoeck the contents to one end. He then drew a knife from his pocket, cut the envelope open at the end, and shook out two pieces of money. Witness then went round to the front of the closet and seized the prisoner, who still had the money, 2s., in his lap. He said, " Oh! good God, let me go, it is my first offence." The stolen letter was not a -, test," but a genuine one, and was addressed to Mr. Robinson, 5, Castle-street, Falcon-square, city. The prisoner was then searched, and a book envelope was found, addressed "- Mills, Esq., Lincoln College, Oxford." The prisoner then sdid, " I never took anything but the book and this one letter." He gave witness the keys of his lodgings in Cambridge-terrace, Hackney, and directed him wheze to find the book.
The prisoner, who made no defence, was committed to Newgate for triaL
M1ARYLEBOxx-Henry Moore, stated to be an old offender, was placed at the bar before Mr. LONG, charged under the following extraordinary circumstances
Mr. Herring attended for the prisoner.
Prosecutor said,-I am footman to a gentleman at No. 6, Blomfield-terrace, Harrow-road. At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon I went into a publichouse in the New-road, and the prisoner and a lot of other fellows were there. A man came in bringing with him some necktie pins, which he offered for sale, and he pressed me to make a purchase. I told hun I wanted nothing of the sort, and that I had no money, upon which prisoner offered to lend me some. I told him [did not require any, and the man with the pins drew from his pocket some nuts and laid them down beside him. He then told me to pick up one, which I did, and prisoner then exclaimed, "Now you are a witness that I lent him a sovereign upon the throw and he has lost it."
Mr. LONG.-Had he lent you any money?
Prosecutor.-Not a farthing. I got up to come away, when prisoner said to me, " Sit down." I got out of -the place, and prisoner and two of his companions followed me as I was ma3dg my way towards home. I felt flurried and asked them what they wanted, and they told me they wanted the sovereign. Soon afterwards the prisoner asked n,e whether I kept my money in a box or not at my place, and he also wanted to know where mymaster kept his plate. I told him that was no business of his, when he threatened to knock my brains out with a stone. The party continued following me till I gothomc, andIthen went indoors. I presently looked through the window, and, seeing prisoner with three others waiting outside, I got a sovereign
And banded it to prisoner, as I scarcely knew what was the best to be done there being only myself and my master, who is an invalia, in the house. A constable came up soon after I gave the money, and the prisouer was taken by him to the station.

WORInate $TSnSET.About a week ago a lithin girl named Sarah Fitts, 12 yeasg of ae, and the daughter of a tobaccopi e maker, was charged at this court by her father with reobing himi. The-father on that occasion stated, that in consequence of his wife being seriously il and ccounfed to her bied his lace -bad been much neglected, and for the r aef vofetre whole of a mconth he had been continually missing clothes, linen, and other articles, the dis-
sppearance of which could not be a ccunted for, but the value of which, in the whole, amounted to about 34 While in this state of perlerity he accidentaly caught sight of a
awnbroker's dupfi ate in the girr' hand, and this exciting is esupicions he was inducedtoquestion her, atd the timl then acknowledgea that it was she who had been commiting the robberies, that she had pledged the goods at the shops of various wnbrokers, and, having produced other duplicates besides elat he had detected in her possession, he thought the only cours that remained for hini to purse was to give her into custody. Thearosecution of the girl was not, however, so importantH , ante, h awnbrokers c imtposing any penalty not exceeding U. upon any pawnbroker who should take n pledge any goods or chattels from a person who should be app aently under 16 years of age, three summonses were directe to be ismued against Charles Sarbet , assistant to a pawnbroker in Finsbury - James fuchardson, assistant to a pawnbroker in Shoreditcis; and Mr. Joseph Roche, in the same business in the Commercial-roaa.
In the first case, the girl said she had pledged two frocks for 2s. with the defendant, she saying nothing material her. self, andl noyqestions being asked her as to )ier age. 'This defendant sai his boxes were very dark, and he could not, therefore, very clearly discern the age of the girL. The magistrate tol him that he should in that case take care to have them. operly lihted, if he wished to escape the penalties of t o act, as the girl did not evidently look more than 12, and fined him 40s. and costs.
In the second. case, the defendant said he at the time believed the girl to be much older, than iut now a rpp aethe warsix aninthe third, where the girl had pledgiedabo, a and cuFffs, thout queations being taked her,' as she said, thfe defctndt repudiated the girl's statement entirely,
and declared that she was altogether mistaken in her identification of him as theperson who aad served her.
Mr. HAmlttle however, considered the duplicate itself as conclusive evidence, and, after remarking upon the results of such *iniscreet conduct, fined each of these defendants also in the sum of 4ul and costs, with an intimation that in all cases of a like kind in futulre he should impte the faUl penalty.

Mr. Kirsting had not been to him, and he was in hourly expectation that his vile would be taken in labour.
Mr. Sacte said if the vpplicant's stry was true ar. Hirsting's conduct was as extraordinary as it was unjustifiable. HistWorship thenwroteanotetoMr.irsting,who

wor. Srf s aid this was a meet unjust case, and he then wrote to hr. Spencer Charrington, the chairman of the Boardl of Guardians, and that gentleman immediately atteaded. Mx. Selfe repeated all that had passed, cwhen
Mr. Charerington expressed his surprise at Mr. Wiriing's condact, and said that the appicant and his family ought, under the cireumstances, to have been reieved immed ately and to have received a midwifery order. It was the wis
of himself and his brother guardians that the poor should always be treated with kindness and consideration.

tended to answer any charge that maight be made against them. The evsidence of several witnesses who were exa. mnined clearly, showed the guilt of Tobin in conveying hidepieces from the prosecutoe's premises, and selling a portion to the defendants, at 32s. perwt.
Mr. Waring said that his hide-pieces were of a superior quality, used in making sire for papermakers and silkes-essers, and that the defendants must have been aware of their value at the time they purchased them of Tobin.
It was contended by Mr. .Rohnson that his clients purchased them through their foreman, as glue-pieces, and gave the usual price for themn-viz., 32s. per owt-and they produced Tobin's receipt to that effect. Tobines father 'had dealt with them upwards of 25 years, and it was supposed that the son came as honestly by the goods as he had in all his dealings, so that the hide-
pieces were not so carfull1 eamne - -as- the-
ngight otherwise have been had any suspicion beeu attached to his conduct. The learned counsel taid that atl thetune the firmwerethrown into a considerablegloom owin to the death of the elder Mr. Procter, who died on the 22d of January ; consequeitly it might have been that his son, one of the defendants, did notlook into the dealings with Tobin so carefully as he would have wished. Under all the circumstances of the case he hoped his worship would dismiss the summons against them, taking it in view that they had not acted in anywise criminally in the matter. The firm had been in existence upwards of 40 years, and during that period there had not been the slightest imputation on their character. They were respectahle merchants, and as much as 50,000. was expended annually by them on such goods. There had been no evidence to show that those gentlem.en had seen the bulk of the property, or that they had anything to do with the purchasing of it. He was istructed to say that they were continually purchasing small quantities of hide-pieces to make glue, and at times pieces of a superior quality got mixed among them, but they used them for one purpose, therefore there could be no criminahty on tbeir part. Under all these circumstances he called upon his Worship to dismiss the snmmons.
Mr. BURCHar said that, on looking over all the evidence adduced before him that day and on a former occasion, he was of opinion that it was a case for a jury to decide.
Mr.Robinson said thatif such was his Worship's opinion he should not call witnesses. He had several gentlemen re sent, among whom were Mfr. Neale, the traveller, and.
Proctor, the foreman, but as he (Mlr. Burcham) intended ts send the case before a jury he should no; call.theum, but reserve his defence until another time. He was positive that at the trial he should be able to show clearly the innocence of the defendants for whom he appeared, aud that there could be no stigma against their characters as merchants and gentlemen.
Mlr. BURC}AM said he had nothing weatever to do with
the charicters of the parties. He must take the case as-he found it according to the evidence; therefore he should commit the four prisoners for trial for stealing the hidepieces, and hold the defendants to bail to ansertecag of receiving them. remanded asrer the charge T pd ntil Thsday next for the lengthy deposition5 to be completed, ind the defendants, ater enternng into the required sureties, left the court with their friends.
Thomas Fisher, a well-known thief, was charged with hrexkig and entering the dwellinghouse of Thomas ffudson, at No. 5o, Mfarigold-street, Bermondsey, and stealing therefrom an accordion, looking-61lasses) plate of varioui description, and a quantity of wearing appareL
LkiUTH.-Irnspector Young ap.lied to the sitting magistate at thig court for summonses for the attendance of the witneses at the final examination of Bacon and his wife on the chare of wilful murder.
Mr. Young sid the whole of the witnesses in the case numbered no less than 29, but sevea of them would attend without the necessity of a summons. To secure the whole he should require summonses for the remaining 22.
Mr. NORTox at once complied with the request.
Since the examination of the prisoners and the Ratland verdict of "Wilful murder" gainst Thomas Fuller Bacon for poisoning his mother the chief constablefor that county called at this court with a warrant, signed by Mr. Hough, tle coroner, for the removal of Bacon to the county gol at Oakhamapon the verdict Bacon being. however, in the custody of the governor of Horsemonger-lane Gaol, under re-examination upon the charge of having kldled his two children, all that the chief constable could do wLs to leave the warrant as a detainer. For this purpose he proceeded to the prison, accompanied by Inspector Young, and at once recognized Bacon, and plcd the warrant in the hands of the governor. Bacon seemed somewhat flushed and alarmed at the presence of the chief constable, and when told the purport of his visit, his replywas, " I aminnocentof the charge, and the truth will come out some day."
Mr. ELLOTT will on the next examination commit the prisonersfor trial tthe Central CriminalCourtduringthe session commencing the 2d of March. Thointervalwill probably be found insufiJcient to get up the prosecUtion, and an application will doubtless be made for the postponement of thetrialto the nesxtseion, in April. Inthe meantime the Court of Qaeen's Bench will be appealed to for the removal of the eoroner's inquisition frotn the county of Rutland, under wFhat is known as " Palmer's Act," so that Macon may take his tria at the Central Criminal Court upon ooth charges. The same ste p will be takenrespXecting any indictment that it may be found expedient to prefer 'before the grand jury at the next Iincol6iee zs respecting the death of IIr. Bacon. isieaszs

The experiments on board the Admiral0y yacht Vivid (il comman4of Captain Smithett), for tbo purpose of testing the efficiency and advantage of Mr. .Jeffreecs patent smoke-consuming apparatus and fuel economiser, having been ordered to be attended by the inspecting officer of steam nachinery attached to Woolwich Dockyard, he proceeded to Dover on board the Vivid, fitted with the apparatus. The operation during the paesage-from Woolwich to Dover was attended with satisfactory results. On the vessel's arrival at Dover the command was handed over to Captain Hammond, whence the Vivid was despatched the same evening with the night mails to Ostend. To obtain a further confirmation of his estimrate the inspector of machinery accompan ied the Vivid to Ostend and back to Dover, the double voyage occupying eight hours and threequarters only. The advantages obtained by the use of the apparatus in the economy of fuel continued to be fuUy apparent, saving from 20 to 25 per cent., and its consumption of smoke evidently successful, the dense black cloud usuaUy observed issuing from the chimney having been entirely absorbed and burnt up. There appeared at no time more than a pale, thin evaporation at the top of the chimney, and that only at intervals. This is the first experiment which has been attempted on board any of Her Majesty's steamers.
The Wye tank steamvessel has been admitted into the basin at Woolwioh, to return stores and prepare for being paid off.

LIABILITY OF SHIPOWNERS.-A deputation from
LIABILITY OF SHIFOWVNEBS.-A deputation from the principal shipowners' associations of the united kingdom had an interview with Lord Palmerston on Saturday week upon the subject of the liability of shipowners in cases of loss of life by fire. Several iembers of Parliament accompanied the deputation. Mfr. Anderson, who was introduced to Lord Palmerston by Lord Hotham, stated that the deputation represented not merely an association of steam. ship owners, butthe entire shipping interest of the kingdom. The object of it was to present the draught of a Bill, which proposes to fix in all cases the statutory amount of damages for loss of life at 301. according to the first clause in the Merchant Ship ping Act, and to define and limit the aggregate amount of liability by adopting'as a measure of that liability the value of 101. per registered ton for a sailing vessel and 11. for a steasnvesseL Lord Palmerston said that the representations made by so influential a deputation should receive most attentive consideration on the part of the Government. Mr. AndeisoD, in explanation, said it was the wish of the deputation' that the Bill should be brought in by the Government ; but they did not expect an immediate answer from the noble lord upon this point.
THE CAPM.IVAL LN PAlus.-The Paris correspondent of the ZNord sends the following details of the late fancy ball eiven by the Minister of Foreign Affairs" Count Walewski and the Countess Walewska received their guests, the former in a black costume of the time of Louis XVI., with powder and the grand blue cordon; and the latter in the mythological costume of Diana, the huntress. About 10 o'clock the crowd of guests began to fill the salon-s, and it was soon regretted that the gentlemen had somewhat too much abused the permission to appear in domino. The flic was wonderfully splendid and animated. The mazurka and the laincers were several times danced, the latter continuing to be the rage among the Parisians. A Styrian quadrille was also danced, in which Mademoiselles de Loventhal and Wadicka and the Count de Castiglione appeared in appropriate costunes. After a splendid supper the ball concluded, as sisual, by a cotillon, which was conducted by the Count de Raincourt, who wore the uniforn of musketeer of the time of Louis XV., with the Countess Walewska as Isis partner. Alnost all the ladies of the Court had adopted the powdered and ribanded style of Madame de Pompadour. Several ladies, among who were Mesdames Strozzi, do Eatzfeld, de Beyens, de Paiva, &c., had adopted a doxnio trimmed with lace and flowers, and so arranged as to allow them to dance. The persons belonging to the Ministry, MM. do Lesseps, de Biling, Declercq, Marchand, Desceaux, Ed. Lefebvre, Armand, and de Trevise were remarked for the good taste and elegance of their costumes. The members of the Persian embassy appeared in the ancient Persian costume. Some young attachcs of Hesse, Bavaria, and Belgium adopted the costuwres of the staff of Prince Eugdne, Count Raroly representing that personage. The Princess Matbilde figared as a marquise of the time of Louis XV.. and worea dressof blue damaskthe Princess Joachim Murat was also a marquise of the same reign, and wore a dress of white damask, with roses and diamonds; Madame de la Poise, one of the ladies of the Empress, Madame de Chassiron, and the Princess Poniatowska, and about 30 other ladies, wore likewise the costumes of marquises of the time of Louis XV. The Spanish Ambassadrese, the Countess de Serrano, wore the costume of Isabel de Valois--a very high dress with a large cross on the breast. The Countess de Castiglione (who was one of the few who had the courage to abandon crinoline) wore a very original costume of exquisite taste-appearing as the Queen of Hearts, crowned with a heart, her hair faUing down on her shoulders a dress with large folds falling straight, ,ornamented with various colours, and wsith heraldic bearings at one side. Mademoiselle Louise Magnan, daughter of the Marshal, wore a huntingoostunie of the tinmeof Louis XV. Madame de Seebach wore the costume of the wife of a Boyard of the time of Peter the Great-a dress of cloth of gold, trimmed with furs, and a profusion of diamonds. The Princess Callimaki was in the costume of Malia de Medicis, and had the hardihood to wear a frill of enormnoiis dimensions. The Princess C7artoriska, who arrived from Rome three days before, had a charming costunme of a Zourgwoisc of the time of Louis XVL -with a large bonnet &a la Necer. Madame Dubois i'Estang looked charming as a grisette of the time of Louis XV. Madame Poujade, niece of the Prince Caimacan of Wallachis, was dressed as a peasant girl of the Danube - the Marquise de Portes was as a native of Cracow ; the two daughters of Baron de HubDer were as village brides of the Opera Comique; Madame Fleury, widow of the General wore the costume of a Lady of thee Conrt of Louis XVI., a silk dress of large designs, gigantic hoop, and a headdress of several ranges sus-mounted with feathers. The Countess Stephanie Tascher de la Pagerie wore the costume of a marquise of Louis XV.; Madame Gensano looked well as a Neapolitan peasant; and Madame de Brigode was snperb in the costutme of a Bohemian lady.

The Reader in Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy at Magdalen CoUege (Mr. Hansel) will deliver a corse of four lectures on the Phenomena of Self-Consoiousness on Friday, the 27th, and Saturday, the 28th inst.; and on Friday, the 6th, and on Saturday, the 7th of March, at 2 o'cloek, in the hall of Magdalen College. These lectures will form a second part supplementary to, though ill a great measure independent of, those delivered lst term on the Phenomena of Sensation.
The Examiners for the Hertford Scholarship have given notice that an examination will be holden in the Writin-. school on Wednesday, the 25th of March, and the two folowing days, for the purpose of electing a Scholar on that fonndation. Candidates are requested to call on the Rev. H. B. Byrne at Queen's College with certificates of their I standing, and of the consent of the head or viceregent of
their college or hall, on Saturday, the 21st of March, between 1 and 3 o'clock. The scholarship is open to all under. geraduate members of the Univer6ity who have not exceeded their eighth term.
It appears by the University Calendar, vwhich is just eub. lished, that aconsidarable increase inthe membersof the UJniversity has taken place during the past year. The number of members on the books of the several colleges and halls is 6,213,as against 6,149 in January of last vear, being an increase of 64. The number of members of Convocation is 3,604, as against 3,512 in 1856. being an increase of 92; the matrieulations in 1856 were 385, being 41 more than in 1855; the B.A.'s were 291, being 55 above the number of the preceding year; and the masters who proceeded to regency were 261, as against 189 in the preceding year, beig an increase of 72. The inereas is greatest at Christ Church, St. John's, and Exeter, Christ Church haoing 30 more members on the books than in January, 18b6, St. John's 21, and Exeter 17. In 12 other colleges and halls there is a small increase, while in eight there is a slight falling off. One (Balliol) remains statonary. The increase in membe-s of Convocation is chiefly at Oriel, Exeter Christ Church, and Trini; being at Oriel21, atExeter 18, and at the other two colleges 12.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Will you allow mc to correct an inaccuracy in the letter of "H.," in answer to that of Colonel Wetberall, which appears in your impression of to-day ? He says that " the Hghlanders, the Guards, and other regiments were not at that time worked w.ith sueh fatsl severity *B the troops more immediately employed in the trenches," for the purpose of proving that these regiments micht have been employed in carrying up clothing, &c., to the troops at
"the front."
It is well known that during the month of December, 1854, the Brigade of Guards were encamped on the heights before Sebastopol, at a greater distance froma Balaklava than any part of the army, with the exception of the Second Division; that in respect of clothing they were at that time in a worse position than any other regiment, inasmuch as they had not at that time received their new clothing, due in May, 1854, which had been prudently kept at Scutari, in the expectation that the army lyould spend the winter in quarters, which existed in the minds of many till lato in the autumn. The labour of carrying up this clothing from Balakliava fell, therefore upon the so.diers of the brigade, as it did upon other brigades before Sebastopol; but it was much lightened by the exertions of the officers, who had before December set apart a number of their own horses, which daily throughout the winter made the journey from Balakilava to the camp, laden with articles for the use of the men.
This recollection reminds me of an idea which often occurred to me on the spot, that had the Commissariat of the army exercised the same forethought shown in this espect by the officers of the Guards, who kept the horses they had devoted to the purpose I have referred to at Balaklava, it would not have " broken down" as it did at an early period of the siege. The horses, being stabled and picketed at Balaklava, would not have had the extra labour of carrying their forage to the front- sheltered by the cliff wlich overhangs the town, they wouid not have been exposed to the piercing blast and the driving snow ; and, above all, being already on the spot to receive the burdens which awaited them, they would have started in good time on their iournez, fresh for their day's work, and arrived
Ut d. h, SO that the much-required artides they arriNe
might have been available for distribution the same day, whereas the unfortunate animals belongiun to the Commissariat, after having fished up some of their pittance of barley out of the mud at their feet, struggled their seven miles through the deep and tenacious clay to Balaklava, husled, and fought, and waited on the crowded wharf for hours, till, as the short winter's dy was ending, they set out on their weary journey home. NTo wonder that, half-fed and wearied, many of them sunk under their burdens, andfound their graves where they fell, so that when their comrades with diminished numbers toiled down again on their morning's trip a few more bony carcases protruding from the soil dotted the line of that fatal road. And in the meantime the parties for the trenches had gone and returned, to find half rations served out to them again, and for them too the overpowerig work of bringing up from Balaklava shot and shell, clothing, huts, and stores, for which the Commissariat " could not find transport." Weare apt to throw blame in many quarters before we find the right one. May not the apparently trifling blunder I have pointed out have been the real cause of the death of hundreds of soldiers? I believe it has, and should you think it worth while to publish this letter or any part of it, perhaps others may agree with.mo. I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

The Survey Of Scotland.
THE SUIWEY OF SCOTLAND.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I read The Times daily. I was so much struck with the force of your observations in your impression of the 16th inst. that I made a copy of that portion of your leading article upon the Ordnance Surve. of Scotland. I have read with surprise the reply of Lieutenant-Colonel James. I am not so presumptuous as to think that vour statements on the subject require confirmation, yet 'beg you will allow me to offer a few remarks on the letter of Colonel James.
It appears that only the cultivated districts of Scotland are to be mapped on the scale of 1-2,500 of the linear measure, or about three chains to an inch, and the towns on the scale of five feet to a mile; the remainder of the country is to be mapped on the six-inch scale. What a confusion of scales we shall have ! lNow, the great objection to this new map on so large a scale, upon which will be delineated even the laundry posts in towns and the straw cattle-sheds in the country, is not merely its expense, although that will be enormous, but it is that the money will be expended upon a work of an ephemera3 oharacter. "The map canneverbehomogeneous,itsseveral portions will not be contemporary, one portion wxll repre sent the country as it is in 1857, and the other as it will be in 1880." Almost as soon as the map is completed it will tel us only of the past, leaning those whom it may concern either to obtain a rew survey of any particular portion, or to patch the Ordnance sheets with corrections, producing that sort of document wbich is alwaysunsatisfactory.
The estimated cost of the six-inch scale for Scotland was 7i50,0001., and we may rest assured that anything like 1,000,0001. will not complete the new map, including the enlarged portion on the scale 1-2,500. If you refer to page 25 in the " Correspondence on the Scales," you will see that this enlarged map seems to be forced upon the people of Scotland, and it is remarkable that 11 out of the 15 Scotch members who formed part of the committee of the House of Commons in 1851 to inquire and reDort upon the state of the survey of Scotland, recommended the abandonment of the six-inch scale for that of the one-inch; but the moap is to be contoured, so the job is likely to be everlast. ing. Colonel Dawson says that if the principle of contouring be carried out to its fullest extent (and he says it is useless otherwise), the cost of the operation would be perfectly unjustifiable. It would be Ul. for a square mile, or over 4d. per acre.
To those who are acquainted with the real history of the Irish survey the boast of Colonel James is very unpalatable. I cannot, of course, go into details. I cannot describe the revisions, corrections, and re-surveys of the first 15 years. I cannot show how a great deal of the labour and expense incurred in obtaining the various heights of the surface were thrown away, because it was ascertained when the work was nearly finished that reliance could not be placed upon the calcu ated heights, and that it was deemned necessary to go over the ground with spirit-levels instead of theodolites, to correct heights, many of which were found to be extremely erroneous.
The survey of the island of Lewis is admitted to be indefensible, but then it was the work of the predecessor of Colonel James. We are indeed slow in appreciating the great engineering experience of Colonel James; but I think we may safely leave his fame to the tender mercies of his successor, whoever he may be.
-_t .A I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Camphor An Effectual Antidote To Strychnine.
CAMPHOR AN EFFE02LUAZ ANTIDOTE TO
STRYCHNINE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES
Sir,-Your impression of this day (Feb. 18) records two more instances of life having been destroyed through the potent agency of strychnine.
The great importance of an effectual antidote being made universally known must be my excuse for begging a p ac in your columns for this brief communication.
In voL RL, page i4, of the Lanwc of 1848, Dr. Pidduck relates an interestingrecovery from poisoning by strychnine. The patient was a weakly man afflicted with neuralgic pains, for which a quarter of a grain of strychnine was taken by mistake, instead of one-sixteenth of a grain.
Five grains of camphor were administered in an emulsion, and almost immediately after taking the dose the spasms ceased.
Another successful recovery is reported by Dr. Tewkesbury, of Portland, Maine, viz. :-A boy was seized with convulsions after eating a biscuit containng one grain and a half, for the purpose of killing rats. The spa ms were so severe that immediate death seemed inevitable, though all the usual remedies were resorted to. Camphor could not be introduced into the stomach on account of the locked aw. Strong injections, therefore, of camphor were used and the body immersed in a camphor bath, and in a few hours the boy was comparatively wel.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIAfES.
Sir,--As you justly enjoy the character of redresser of public evil and as your columns are always open to the defence of rght against wrong, I venture to lay before your innumerable readers a source of great evil iu our rural parishes, hoping that public opinion, when brought to bear upon it, may tend to check the abuse.
It is customary, when a sale of stock and other farming implements takes place, for the owner of the goods sold to ply his customers at that sale with an unlimited amount of dnnk, and, of course, not of the best sort. Beer and ale of a very doubtful quality, spirits still worse-if we are to judge of them by their effect upon those who drink them-are handed round freel)- to all who will partake of them. The object is, of course, so far to stupefy tbe buyers as to induce them either to bid against each other, thus to raise the sale, or to bid for what after all they do not want. Anything and at any cost, so that the goods be cleared, though it be by the destruction of moral feeling of many, both iru the injury done to themselves and in the revolting scenes which follow.
Under the existing law relative to public-houses, some check, though not to a very great extent, is Dut upon drunkenness and disorderly behaviour in those houses ; but in the case of public sales by auction of this kind there is no check whatever. True, a policeman maY attend them, and he may summon the worst cases of drunkenness and riot; but this is but an inefficient remedy for the evil, for in this case prevention is far better than cure. There ought to be some by-law intended to protect public morals and good order, which would make that man liable to an indictment on whose premises a single case of drunkenness or of disorderly behaviour took lace at a sale. It would oblige men who ought to know tter, not wilfully to injure their neighbours for their own interest, by plyingthem with deletenrous drink; it would prevent the crowd of idlers who only attend those sales in order to drink from coming, and it would save the respectable and well-behaved inhabitants
of our parishes the disgustingsight ofered both at the sale and igh andlef of he oad earit wichare a disgrace
One such a day ina parishd does more injury to it than 20
I have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfullv.
