STATE OF TRADR. MANCHESTER, MAY L There has been a very quiet market for most descriptions of goods, and, although albht concessions in prioe have been madie, the sales even in those cases have ben small and effected with difficulty. The demand for domestics is limited, and as stooks are beBoning to accumulate prices are not easily sustained. Printing cloth can only be sold at a reduction. Shirtings have also been dull of sale, and sellers having manifeeted some easiness prices have been lower where transactions havo taken place. In yarns thele is great indi&position to operate, and for many descriptions the demand is more limited than it has been for some time past. Spinners being 'without stock are firm in their quo. tations, and there is consequently no great alteration in price; but the tone of the market is evidently in favour of buyers, and in come instances, especially warps and cops for the home trade, there has been a reduction of id. to id. per lb. since last week. Messrs. Robert Freeland and Brothers, in their monthly circular of this day, report:- * The business of the pest month haa been of a defultory charter dull and sluggish generally, and when active ha been felt only in parv ticular dlaws of goods. On the one hand the producer ha been premsed by the high price of tbe raw material and the inallnes ot tse margin left to him for the proce. of manufacture, while on the otherband the purchaserhas been deterredbytheconeinued striago of the money-market from doing more than supplying his hmmediate wants. Thus on neither dsde hka there been much readlness to enter Into large transactions, and the business done baa been byno means genernl. Stocks of goods, therefore, hav begun to Accumulate, and we And holders within tho last few days Olm posec to submit to a reducUton upon lat moonth's ratens wbilee obeerve rather more dinpvoition on the part of buyers to o ate wbre they cau do o upon advantageous terms. As soon as ocs are cleared out we look for the old ates to be re-established, and purchases can be made now probably on better terms than a month henco. Nor need there be any appreher"ou of a faU in the value of gDods from any considerable do. chno in i-at of the raw materiaL Indeed, we fe iro tendoncy 'wMil rather be tbo other way, for the more 'we examine the subject the stronger s our opinion that tbe consumtion of cotton is going on at a much greater rate than is gDenerally suppcd whkich cannot fall to have t effiB ect sooner Cr later.

MOXBF-llf.AMWT-aha(j.rTy : -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~I. -?NB-MF *lYBLLGBSOD. Friday Evening. This being the day for the half-yearly balance at the Bank of England, the tranafQt-offlcea were closed, and there was no astendance at the StockExchange. Some few irreoular dealings, however, were reported at 92i to 9'i for the account, being ahl improvement of an eighth on the cloeing price of yesterday. The demand for money in the discount-market and at the Bank continues without the slightest abatement. The requirements to-day are supposed to have been party in preparation for the heavy liabilities to bs met on on ay, the 4th, and partly to pay for a considerable portion of the silver to be talen by thelPera to andCha,which, although beiow the amounts shipped by the previous mails, willatillbe about 500,0001. Generally however, the feeling in the city to-day seemed rather less unfavourable. The arrivalof the Magdalena from Mexico and the West Indies with 530,000. exercised a satisactory influence, and the letters from Paris notwithstading a further fall on the Bourse, . were?n a rather more confdenttone. FromPiennathe accounts describe almost a panic with rerd to the shares of new undertadkngs with which the market has been flooded, but there does not atpresent seem to be any apprehension of irretrievable mischief in that quarter. During the- coming week the movements in the variouslEuropean money-markets willdepend in a considerable degree on the reports of the progress of the silkworm in Italy, Spain, and FranEh; and also on the question whether tho late severe weather has been foundto have inflicted damage on the grain or other crops. In the foreiga exchangea this afternoon the rates generally were a shade firmer than lAst post. The corn-market was again firm this morning, and an advance of Is. was in some instances . ob. tained. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a restricted buiness at rather lower prices. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 60c. for money and 68f. 55c. for the present account, showing a renewed fall of a quarter. per cent., attributable, most probably, to difficulties i the progress of the monthly liquidation. The following vessels with gold fromn Australia are now daily expected :-The Morning Star, with 32,209 ounces; the Sydenban, with 31,462 ;the South Carolin, with 20,493; and the Thames, with 4,780-making a total of 88,944 ounces, valued at 366,7761. This is exclusve of 40,004 Shipped by |the Oneida steamer. La Plts, West India st7amer, to-morrow Wi take out 36,000l. in specie, of which 30,l100h X gold, probably intended for tepurchaseof silver n Cuba and elsewhere. In the produce-market during the week a moderate businews hb been transacted, and pricms generally are without material change. For sugar the demand has been active throughout, and, notwithattanding the large quantity again brought forward, quotations close at an advance of ls to Is. 6d. Numerous purcha3es on LiverDool account have given a stimulus to the market here, speculators being extensive buyers, while the home trade also have shown a EtrCon dedre to increae their stocks. Five cargoes of Mauritius and Rix or seven of foreign changed hands, chiefly for this kingdom, besides many parcels on the spot. The latest sles of unclayed Mania were effected at 45s. to 45X. 6d. The stock in the port of London is till light, and the present high value has not thus far Influenced the deliveries. The plantation Ceylon coffee brought forward has found buyers, but not in all cases at the rates of last week. Three floating cargoes, however, of St. Domingo and Rio taken for export brought fully former terms. Cocoa has been rather higher as regards the better kinds. There is more inquiry for rum, with a firmer market, in eonsequence of a dminution of the pre to sell second-hand parcels. White rice has barely supported its former value, but five floating cargoes of Rangoon and Arracan were disposed of at comparatively high ra. At the quarterly sales of cnamon on Monday a more active demand arose at Id. to 2d. improvement upon second, third, and fourth qualities, nearly 2,000 bales finding buyers, besides several parcels subeequently. Fine first sorts were slightly lower than at the last series. Saltpetre, after being dull for some days, is now fir.mer, and for fine Bengal 4. to 44s. Is paid. Some parcels have been realized afloat, chiefly at 41s. 6d. In tea there have been few transactions. The public sales on Thursday passed off without much spirit, about one-fourth of the qulantity brought forward being sold. Nio speculative demand for common congou exists, but the trade are buyers of the good sound qualities. The copper smelters have given notice of a reduction of 91. per ton in the price of copper. The following letter has been addressed by the India-house to the chairman of the Indian Junction Telegraph Company: - India-house, April 30. " Sir,-With reference to the coryespondence that hu pawsed on tho subject of the establishient of telegraphic communication between this country and India by way of Asiatio Turkey and the Persian Gulf, I am commanded to state that the Court of Direotors of the Bast Indi Company have resolved to meet the wishes of the European aud Indian Telegraph Company by allowing Sir William O'Shaughnessyto accept the appointment of consulting engineer to that company. " The Court have likewise reolved to sanction the employnent by the Telegraph Company in the construction of the line through Aiatoc Turkey of Captain Charles Douglas, of the Bengal Artillery, and .ieutenant Arthur Hawres, 3Sth Regiment Beng71 *ative Infantry, it being understood that the salary and allow/ances of those o9ficers during such employment are to be paid by theTelegraph Comupany. "I am, Sir, your moat obedient humble servant, "JM1E S C. 3IAL-VII "W. P. Andrew, Esq." At the annual meeting of the Assam Company, held to-day, Mr. H. M. Eemshead in the chair, the dividend declared was at the increased rate of 8 per cent., and the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. Annexed is an abstract of the report .- " The directors again present a report of operations during the past year showing a state of continued prosperity and steady progress. The great obstacle to rapid progress-the difficulty of obtaining labour-still continues to exist. ubrther supplies of Bengal coohes were sent up during the last season, the greatest care having been used in their selection, but nearly all turned out badly. This subject has had the constant attention of the locai'board. The indigenous tea plant having been discovered in Cachar-a district stated to be favourably situated for obtaining a supply of labour-grants of land have been applied for in that province, and the secretary of the local board has been deputed to inspeot tho land, and to make the neceasary arrangements for carring out extensive clearances during thu next cold season. The managing director in Calcutta paid a visit to the plantations in October and Novem- er lat, and has reported most favourably of the condition of the factories, with some small exceptions, caused by the failure of the hoeing contractors. The sorting and paoking departments at Naseerah attractedhis par. ticular attention, with a view to the diminution of the large stock of tea in store, by expediting its despatch- an the arrangements h has made have been so su&essfui that between the 4th of November and the 28th of February 4,473 cheats of tea were received at Calcutta, and there is every probability that the whole of the crop of 1856 will be despatched from Assanby the end of March. This will be very beneficial, for the whole attention of the establishment wilbe given to the preparation and despatch of the present season's crop of tea as it is received from the factories. lNew forest clearances wFere effected in 1855-56, measuring abu 5 oas _Omn' to the failulre of some of the hoeing contractors, the seedlinhs have seffered at one or two of the factories; but the vacant spaces have been carfully resown during the present season, and new contracts entered into for the clearane and cultivation of about 224 pdorabs of freah land. These contracts are underakken by mben whowerenot proviouslye loyedintheservioe, and as each contractor has only from =tee to five poorahs of land lotted to him, there will be less chance offailare, and, iu the event of failure, less inconvenience and loss will be occasidned. By this arrangement the old contractors are ke t employed in hoeing the existing gardens with a vierf to improving their cultivation. The crop of seasen 1855, which in the last report was stated to amount to 558,6281b. (the same having been calculated as heretofore at llb. of manan faktured tea to 411b. of green leaf), actually weighed out 583,0941b. The crop of the p ast season, calculated from the quantity of green leaf gathered, and manufacturod as after mentioned, amounts to 638,7891b. of tea, being an increase of 55,6951b. over the crop of the previous year. Heretofore the crop has been estimated at llb. of manufactured tea to every 431b of green leaf gathered; careful examination has proved this to be incorrect, and that the quantity of green leaf required to produce lb. of manufactured tea is only 4&Lb. The crop ofthe past season has therefore been calculated upon this estimate. The crop of tea of season 1857 is estimated at 700,0001b; this estimate has been formed from the atual area of producing lands, but its realization must depend upon the extent of labour available during the minufacturing seawon. The produce of season 1855 (with the exoeption of ono small sipmont of the lower clas of tes) has been sold, and has realized the sum of I& 10id. per lb. net, a price which is consddered to be satisfactory, having regrd to the dull state of the tea-market during th, greater portion at Is O.al.nt, il ie 6,16. trln. 8h. per cent, upon the paid-up eapital od t# opa I(beingi per cent. mr ban-the dilded paid Iaatyea); whiclt he payable on tho 24th of June next." The following account of the Manchester trade for tie pat nonth is from the cireular of Mea-r& Robert Barbour asd Brother:- I " A alight -decline hu taken plaoctin theivalue of nicet of the aptples of tbis district during th xouth.h Thisis more paricurly fthe case with manufactured goodo, which can be purciased about 2i per cent. under thi rates curet in' Mareb, but in yarns the concessiot is compaativey smalL | The quotations given depend a good deal on the position, as to stock or engagements, of the manufrcurer or spbiner, so that, on thewvol0, the moarket has been dull and irle- l.r, and increasingly sO as the month advancd up to the present time.- Th high value of money, which 'hitherto baaad little apparent effect on burma., begins zo*to. e felt, and there is consequently a want of oonfidence as to present prices being maintained.

Tnit mchl groin eror Is mixed up with lb. popular belief in what is trmedwitchoratis undoubtedl- true, but equalIy tre may it be that rejection of'the subjea4 s mere xuperstition of the vulgar is Iroof nobof enighteanment, but, of insifficient'knowledge-of ignorance of the deeperoa of natue's book. whose who hAv studied the modern phenomena of muesmerma, clairvoyance ana others more -starling still, asuc who have pad attentioh to the insnces of aponous developmentof thesophenomena aboundingt out ti litratue, the chronicles and leend of antique medimoYs times, are struck with a meness so comp between theold phenomena and the new astobeire sistbly, led to Infer the exstence cf- an oocut law to which To amoDus t for this uameness on the ground of C" obstinae'vitality of tradition" 'will not do, for it is a sameness far lees of the letter than of the spirit, an esential identity discernible through mnch superficial dissimilarit, and existing not only between the old supernatural (s caled) manifestations sad those of the irsent day, but a between those of the most widely different and distaat regions-between the witchcraft of Ural l6qalities in England and the soromries of the African deerts and of the forests and praizioa of the New World .Xay not tbiw propensity, aeenl so powerfully to exist in the hImanu mind tow&Tds the mystrion, point to correlative fact. diml gUinmering through the vast, the unexplored tract of ixatrs realm? That it is not to be corrected by eduoation, that it may be found in the 'higbest and bert balanced minds, might-be proved by abundant examples. T: will content myself with quoting the opinion of Addaaon os witchcraft. After remarking on the university of the belief and, at the same time, on the imposture and delusionw of this nature that had been detecd, Ie thus concludes:"When I consider the question whether there are such peosons as those we all witches, my niua is divided betreeNL two oppite opinion,, or rather to speak my thoughts freelby,Ubelive that taere is and ;as been such a thimg at witchcraft, but at the same time can give no credit to any partcular instanoce of it."

LOZVDOAV, SATUBDAY, MAY 2, 1857. The republication of certain reports and despatches, received some twelve years ago, on the relative merits of Hongkong and Chusan may be ta7ken as indicating an intention of reconsidering the whole question of British settle. ments on the coast of China. The island of Chusan, after remaining for some time in our possession, was surrendered to the Chinese Government on the fulfilment of the Treaty of Nankin, and [Hongkong was accepted as an establishment from which the interests of British commerce in those parts of the world might be protected and advanced. Into the considerations which dictated these arrangements we shaZl not at present enter, but it is plain enough from the event that, in the general scope of the Treaty, too much concesion was made to the Court of PzxN, and too little security taken for the claims of European intercourse and trade. To come at once, and in plain English, to the real points at issue, what do we want with China, and with what objects are we engaging ourselves in those remote and uncongenial regions ? We desire, in the first place, nothing but what the Chinese are as deeply interested in granting as we are in demanding-facilities for purchasing the produce of their country. Whatever may be the natural capabilities of India, there is at present no country but China which can export tea enough for the consumption of Europe. The Chinese posse a virtual monopoly of one of the necessaries of European life, nor are they in any degree blind to the value of their position. On the contTary, their eagerness for trade-stimulated, no doubt, by this extraordinary demand, and perhaps also by the difficuty of subsistence in an overpopulated countryhas become so predominant a feature in the national character as to overpower even the arrogance inherited from ages of seclusion and selfconceit. In the papers now before us it is assumled as an axiom, that wherever the barriers imposed by Government are removed the place vill be inundated by Chinamen in quest of trade as surely as water finds its level, and at this very moment we have actual proof of their entertaining that identical spirit in regard to conumerce which in their design against Sara*ik they were pleased to .attribute to ourselves. They have set ja price upon our heads, and ae wreaiiig their fury in masacre an4 incendiarism, but they continue to bring their teas to market as before, and the exports appear to be rather higher thau under ordinary circumstances. Here, then, is the first condition of the case-a nation of buyers on one side and a nation of sellers on the other, and what is there which should prevent their meeting in fair and amicable market? Nothing, as it seems, except the barbaric pride which survives in national traditions, and which was treated with too much indulgence by us when we had the opportunity to correct it. Tho Chinese represent one of the most ancient empie of the world, and, though their civilization countb in many respects for little more than bari barim when contrasted with the living realities of modem power, it had been already attained in ages when modern States had not emerged from the first forms of savage life. In Asia, too, until the arms of Europe carried back tho tide of entaprise from West to EAt, the Chinese Emp had never known a rival in grandeur or dominion;anad even now its, pou -ton is supposed' to comprise onethirdl of all the inhaFitants of the earth. To the assumption thus natura1y engendered were adde- the' jealousies arising from the policy -of an alien and intrusive dynasty. China is uot administeked by Chinese, but by Tartars. About the time -at whioh otir own civil wars commenced an inroad of -Tartars from the territories North of. China transferred the government of the Celestial Empire to the invaders, and in the hauds of their succescorn it still reomins, except in so far as the rebellion which a few years sincewas directed expressly against them may have curtailed their power. Partly, perhaps, on account -of the promity of the tribes from which they sprang, and partly becaiise the Northern and Central provinces of China are really the most populous and flourishing, the Mantchoo or Tartar Government has always fixed its seat at Peldn, in the very northernmost - district of the empire. From analogous conBsiderations, also, it has endeavoured to limit the contact of foreigners to a point at the very opposite end of its dominions, in the extreme South, and, although other ports were opened to us by the Treaty, of Nankin, great anxiety was shown to exclude us from penetrating beyond a certain degree of- north latitude.; So rigorously, in fact, for manyg&ierations has this cauttion been exercised, that whe Lord khOARTHNBY proceeded on hia embassy to Pekin nothing was known of the navigation of the Yellow Sea, though there was no reason why it should not have been as open aS any part of the North Pacific. Thus, however, by a combination of causes, was our commercial position defined with exclusive reference to the interests and caprices of the Chinese themselves. In order that European traders-a class at once obnoxious and contemptible in the eyes of the Imperial Court-should be banished as far as possible from the seat of Government, we -were confined to Cauton 'as our commercial port, although it was far distant from the provinces where the chief amount of tea was produced; and, in order to confirm the natives in their disparagoement of foreign barbarians, the population of the city.was encouraged to subject us to every species of insult and degradation. We enriched the- whole empire by -our commerce; and we threatened not the smallest harnt to any Chinese institution, yet foi all that we were confined like creatures of an inferior caste to a small space on the river's bank, debarred from common access to the adjacent country, and treated on all occasions as people who owed whatever they possessed to the sufferance of their betters. After the delusion on which this system was grounded had been rudely shaken by the late war, the improvement in our position was significantly expressed by our advance towards the North. The ports of Shanghai and Ningpo were opened to us, but the isiand of hus_an-a position which would have established us in a more commanding attitude, both as to influence and commerce-was evacuated, after an occupation quite long enough to show us the advantages it conveyed. The events of the next few months will bring with them their own instruction as to the policy which it will now be advisable to pursue; bat there can be no doubt as to the imperfections of our last convention. That it did not fulfil the conditions desirable, in terminating the outrageous abasement of Europeans-that it did not effectually bring the Chine to a seme of our right to be treated on at least a footing of equality, or adequately provide for that expansion of commerce which would carry xuch advantages to both nations at once, is now sufficiently manifest. Its defects, in fact, were glaringly exhibited in the non-execution Qf one of its owns stipulations ; for, wJiereas it was 'exprensly agreed. that we shQuld no longer stand excluded from the city of Canton, the Cantonese were allowed to pleaa their own truculence and ferocity, in defiance of the very injunction which had been devised to control them. For the future we want exemption from insult and security for trade-nothing more. Any territorial cession will only be demanded in aid of these purposes. We desire such establisments as will enable us to conduct in a proper fashion an enormous trade at the distance of many thousand miles from homs. We desire that in these transactions we may be no longer exposed to offence from a barbarous city populace, encouraged to degrade us as evidence of its own superiority; and we expect such a settlement of affairs as 'will relieve us hereafter from any recurrence of embarrassments like the present. For the assumptions of the Chinese there is really not the slightest justification. They cannot, after what they have seen and felt, affect to regard us as inferior barbarians; they cannot, after so many generations of intercourse, profess to dread our Volitical encroachments; nor can they, after the proofs they have given of their own adventurous and audacious spirit, pretend to the privileged exclusiveness of the unsocial but conitent Japanese. They avail themselves in swarms, and without the smallest scruple, of our trade, our markets, and our territories over the whole surface of the globe, and they can have no title whatever to erect a barrier round their own.
On Thursday Mr. THomNxLy, while seconding the motion that Mr. EvmLm DEZNIsoN should take the chair as Speaker of the House of Commons, took occasion to Eay a few words upon the evil of "long speeches." The shade of poor Mr. BBOTEBRTON must have experienced a certain amount of satisfaction as Mr. THOnNwLY exclaimed against the practice of commencing long seeches afterll o'clock at night, " keeeing us here out of ovr beds." This is by no means the first time that this subject has been brought under the notice of the House. There is little doubt aS to the reality-there may be sonoe as to the cause, of an evil which the public, in common with the members of the House, must deplore. On certain great occasions the business of the House is, no doubt, protracted to a great length; but these occasions aTe not of frequent occurrence, and it would be unwise in such cases, and difficultperhaps impossible-to impose any restriction upon the tactics on either side. When a great fieldday occurs, victory must be won at any cost,even at that of keeping a strongheaded senator away from his place?" uxor and hIs accustomed sleep. The rival leaders 'wi not throw away a chance, nor leave theuelves- qpen to inconvenient re$iet-by' sang gatthe wrong- time,' abit more than generau in the field -will bring their reserves underfireprematuije,ii order that as many as have not been shot may lie don 'for a quiet ileep on the-hotly-contested plain. These great occasions, then, we dimiss from consideration altogether, as being very confident that on these the House would not tolerate the shadow of interference with its privileges of speech. Many among our reader3 may remember that some six or seven years ago the whole subject was fully' discussed before a Special Committee, and that many of the chief worthiei of the House were examined with the view of ascertaining their opinions upon the posibility of curtailing generally the somewhatexmbeut proportions of Parimentary eloquence. More than this the practice of foreign Aemblies was carefully and-closely regarded, and more especially the practice of the House of Representatives in the United States, and of the Chamber of Deputies in chartered France. The result, however, of the inquiries was, that nothing cobld be done by poeitive regulation. Remedy for the mischief must be loft to the individual discretion of members,' and to the public opinion -of the House in the -aggregate. Wfhatever might be the extent of the evils complained -of; inconvenielces of a worse character would arise from any attempt to weight the oratorical efoiits o4 the less remarkable members, or to colfine the leaders of the House within those limits which gods, men, and reporters would fain assign to the independent efforts of. those aspiring young senators who are aiming at the orato3?s chaplet or the statesman!s fame. Now, in all this matter there has been a good deal of outery which has really not been justified by the facts of the case. We do not to a certain extent deny the existence of the evil, but its cause has. been a good deal misinterpreted, and so has the remedy which would work a cure. With the exception of two or three astounding bores, who will of course be found in any assembly composed of 600 men, the long speeches are really confined to the acknowledged gladiators of the House. It is a very unusual thing for Messrs. BPowi, Jorxsz, and ROBNSON to trouble the House at any -length. Even when they do, we should consider, I in the case of these unfortunate martrs, that, if their own peculiar tastes were consulted, they had much rather abstain from these oratorical displays. They- are not speaiang to- M. SPFE&Kn, they are not colloguing with their colleagues, but they are taking to a constituency some two or three hundred miles off, of which every independent elector will to-morrow rejoice to see his own particular form of nonsense covered with Parliamentary honours. Why, that is the very way in which the govermnent of this country is carried on I If the House of Commons did not present in its views, in its tone, in its talk, a reflex of the nation, it would *not. endure for ten years as one of the institutions of the country. Let ua not, then, wholly complain of those tedious speeches in the House, whith after all-no indifferent personreads, and to which we cannot be condemned to listen by the sentence of any known tribunal. It becomes, of course, a more serious matter when we find that they interifere with the transaction of the real business of the country. Thqre can be no doubt that, to a certain extent, this is the case; and yet the evil rather depends upon the bai and defective arrangement of public business than' upon the mere tediousness of speakers. We believe that 'far too little time is given to the Government for the time being, of whatever political complexion it may be, for the transaction of the business which is necessarily cast upon their shoulders. They have to originate the financial arTangements of the country; they must deal with 'all, certainly with most, questions of legal refohn; the great bulk of administrative measures must be forged upon Government anvils. They have tatements to make and explanations of all kinds to give, which consume, idly for their purposes, a considerable portion even of their own nights, and these nights'are but two in the course of the week. It may astonish people who are not accustomed to look to figures to be told that if the Government of this country has a right to the ear of the House of Clommons for about 50 nights every year, that is the extreme limit of their privilege. Even of these 50 nights all may be tanpered with indefinitely by the prevailing eloquence of the political partisans wrho have any private or party interest to serve by spealing against time. After all, the great error which is made by the IIouse of Commons is the error which is made by any inexperienced person in the beginning of life. How prodigal of useless efforts, of spirits, of energy, and of vital fluid is any young. man or wolzian of 18 years of age I See them at 50 trying, and- trying- in vain, to make up for lost time. - At the outset of a Session, as at the outset of life,'there' can'be no su6hbthing as weariness or deficiency of time. Who will advocate what crotchets? There is room and verge enough for all. The idlest and most usless discussions are protracted to any length which, in the opinion of the most longwinded members of the House, may be necessary for the full development of their views and the entire confusion of the views of their opponents. Two days of each week are asigned to the members as private members, and during tho early weeks of the Semion these weekly two days are ordinarily muddled away in a manner which is not calculated to inspire an impartial spectator with much respect for the discussions on private legislation. We do not undervalue the right of every member to bring forward any measure which he may deem expedient for the public advantage-certainly we would not see the opportunities for bringing forward such measures unduly curtailed; but when we see, o*n the one hand, so much of the most important business of the country slurred over in the small hours, or neglected altogether for want of time; and, on the other, so much valuable time trifled away, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that a better arrangement of business might be made in the public interest. Here, in point of fact, lies the true secret of the long speeches with which our souls are tormented and our types worn away. For two nights of each week- the House of Commons may resolve itself into a debating society, and then it is the orators come to light. For two other nights there is nothing but pressure of business, late hours, and scamped or neglected work. Cannot MIr. THonrnLy, who deplores the effects, help to cure the causes of this Parliamentary evil ?
M. DuPnz has been asuring the Academy of Bloral and Political Sciences at Paris that it is a great mistake to suppose England a free-trading country. She is, indeed, a most accomplished hypocrite. While she has been " trumpeting " forth her " libre &lzange," she has been obtaining more than twenty millions sterling a-year from her Customs, and shown a particular spite to theilk manufactures and other productions of France. On this occasion the character of England was warmly and ably defended by M. MICHEL CsVAlaB, a man as well known as M. Duz%, and with opinions less dependent on circumstances, interests, sensations, and years. It is no. purpmo of ours to show what ia too well known in France,-that M. DuriN is perpetually neutralizing his own sateMents, or, as we say, eating his own words. B3ut it maybeworthwlle, on this particular poit, Just to present the facts of the cse6 before such- of our~ neighbours as care to have them. .For this pur.pose we will take the most recent return of otdr -revenue, that for the year.ending. Lst March 31; and if M. DurenP wishes for any other year we are ready to follow him. In that year it is very true, and we sufficiently lament the fact, England did raise by Customs-that is, by taxing the produce of other countries-no les a sum than 23,321,8431. But, then, she raised from other sources more than twice as much-that is, 49,012,2191. In no commercial country is the proportion of revenue raised by Customs so small compared with the whole. Bat what is most noticeable about ouar Customa' Tariff Is, that it is all for revenue, none for protection. It can only be for revenue that we raise so large a proportion of the sum paraded by M. DuInfI from sugar, tea, coffee, tobacco, and other exclusively foreign procductions. In this country we do not attempt. to produce our own sugar and tobaoco. On spirits we carefully adjust the Excise and the Custos4, so thO the lJitM all not oper, s protection.- We carry this principle of adjutzn^t. through almost every agticl@ of- general consump. tion that happens to be produced both at home and abroad-on hops and on paper, for exaaple So thoroughly is the principle reoognized, that if M. DuriN can suggest to the working population of England any one articleo on which. they aro taxed not for the neessities of the State, but for the convenience of ourmanufacturers, or any other class, they have only to lay their case before Parliament, and, on proof, it will be immediitely set 3ight. Mr. DumN, however, has in his eye certnsu articles which in this country are luxuries, which are either not to the taste of the general population or are confessedly superfluous. That brings us at once to one of the leading principles of our taxation, one which every enlightened and philanthropic financier ought to respect even when he cannot adopt it. We lay the burden of our taxation on wealtl*, on luxury, on- indulgence, on finery, on fastidious tastes. In a quiet and unostentatious way our finance -i democratic and disciplinarian It does the duty of the Roman Censors, the laws of LYcunous, the sumptuary laws of the medimval Commoorivealths, the asceticism of the Church, of seraons, of .rules, of all those dire;t attempts at ths reformation of manners that are admired in books - and defeated in practice. We tax silk manufactures and other foreign articles of dress on the same principle that we tax tobacco. The Engisih labourer or artian, or his wife, can do perfectly well without a foreign hat, bonnet, gloves, shoes, lace, ribands or other articles of dres These things are made quite as durable, for the money, in this country. It is true that for the same money something mnore in fashion can be obtained from abroad, but that is a difrerence for which it is quite reasonable that the British purchaser should pay a trifle to the revenue, as he does also for his tobacco. Even a family in genteel life -a clergyman's family, for example-can live in health, strength, and refinement without contributing from one yeases end to another ever so 'indirectly one farthing to that part of our revenue stigmatized by M. DuPix with a Protectionist character. If - it wants silks at all, it need not go beyond the range of our home manufactures. After silks, velvets, and articles of dress, wine is the -sorest point of our Tariff in the eyes of a Frenchran, As. it is a point which we desire to leave.open for inquiry, we shaU purposely guard our language upon it; but, as a facts wine is a luxury in this country, and, as it happens, particularly French wine. There is no wine made in France that an English labourer would thank his master for; he would think it "something that had been spoilt." Use itself, at least frequent opportunity, produces no change; for it is quite a joke in English households, that whereas a decanter of port left in the care of servants is seen no more, the finest quality of claret sffers no such disappearance. The servants wonder 'Why their masters drink such stuff. There may possibly be a change some day, and-even the wvin ordi,vire may be dressed up for the vulgar English taste; but, as a matter of fact, French wine is now the luxury of the better classes, and is taxed accordingly; not for protection. We are not informed to what extent M. DuPnK admitted the importation of European silk manufactures into this country. It is, however, considerable. We must take into account that It chiefly consists of the more costly fabrics, on which most labour is employed and most taste displayed. During the three months ending last March 31 we imported 3,089,6601b. of raw silk This was about three times as much as we imported in tie corresponding quarter. of the previous year) and twice as mtch as in the corresponding quarfer of the year before that. The average of the three years would give about 2,000,0001b. of raw silk for the first quarter of the year; yet in the first three mouths of this year we imported from Europe 81,5631b. of sl or satin " broad stuffs," and 131,2551b. of ribauds, besides other items of silk manufacture; and these figures are very little above the average. However, we need not insist on any particular articles, or even on the Tariff in force in this particular year. The question is one of evident tendency, of serious intention, and of actual effort. For the last four years we have not been in a condition to mitigate our Tariff or any part of our taxation; for it would have been ridiculous to come forward with aIproposal to reduce the duty on milinery, silks, and velvets, at the very time that we were levying ls. 4d. a-pound on incomes, snd extending the range of that unpopular impos. All other financial considerations must bow to the stern necessities of war, and the present is therefore a very ungracious time to select for invidious criticism on our finance. We hope very shortly to resume the great movement it which England had the honour to take the lead. AL Durx&s remarks, however, deny the movement altogether. He says England has trmpeted a falsehood, and is not an honest Freetrader. He denies that we havo done 'what we could, or even anything worth spealing of. The exgeration of this statement shows its animus, and, as our own case is clear to the whole world, we are only sorry for M Durnc.

HOIJSE OF COIIONS, FiRID MiY 1. The Houe of Commons sat to-day, at 2 o'cloclk, for the purpose of presenting the Speaker elect for Her Majests &pprob6tion, in obedienoe to the Royal Mesage delirered by the Lords Commissoners at the opening of Parliament. The attendance ws not so numerous as it was Testerday. The Government wa representea by Sir Charles Wood; and Mr. Disraeli was the onlynotable member of the Opposition present. Shortly after 2 o'clock Sir Augustus Cliftord, the Gentle. =a& Usher of tho Black Rod, entered the House, and advancing to the table, s&id,-"IMr. Speaker, the Lords, authorized by virtue of a Royal commision, desire the imsediate attendance of this hon. House in the House of Peers to hear the oommicsion read." The Speaker elect, who was attired in a black Court snI and an undres wig-it not being customary for him to ame his robes of offioe until the Royal approbation ha3 been signified-left the House, attended by the Seijeatat Arms with the maoe, and followed by the grternumber o the members present. On returning to the House of Commons, The SPEAKER ssid,-I have to acquaint the House tba the House has been to the House of Peers, when lBer Majesty was pleaed by Her Commisioners to anprove the choice the House had made of myself to bo their Speaker; &nd that I haTe in their z.m% and on their behalf, by humble petition to Her Majesty, laid cliim to alu their ancient rights ad privileges, which Her Majesty ha3s on. firmed to them in as full and ample a manner as they have been heretoforo granted or allowed by Her Majesty or any of Her Majestyes Royal predecessors. Once more repeating my most respectful acknowledgments for the honour which the House has conferred upon me. I haev to remind the Houso that the next duty which we have to perform is that every member shouda take and subscribe the oatha precribed by law. The usual Parliamentary oaths were then administered by the Chief Clerk to the hon. gentleman himself, standing ox the steps of the chair, after which The SPEAEPIR said,-Members wll now come forward to be sworn at the table in the alphabetical order of eounties as their names are read eut by the Clerk at the table. The ordinary table of the House had been considerably enlarged by the addition ef two extra tables, round which the members who came forward, to be sworn ranged themselves as their nmesweex called out.

EXHIBITION OF THE ROYA L AcADEMy. KeisesreeS glIcl dem =dern. doch glelch Peyfeder denm chat,eu ViRtle dszu macenat e3styieder fvloedotin ich." Among other questions which the annual Exhi'ibition ot the Royal Academy invariably suggests to qss is the-we trust we may Bay-not impertinent one, " Whq edits the catalogue V' We knoyr of no -ther document appearing under official sanction which is disfigured by suich unpardonable blunders of orthography and punctuation. Reading "jeder' for " feder" in the motto of this year's catalogue, the very sound principle which the President has celected from the German poet may be Englished < No one be liko to another, ye' each be like to the highest; 4' How may this be attaived? each be complete in himself." It would be impossible to offer souinder advice to ihe British painter. "Perfection" is an attribute -of worke in the lowest as of those in the highest sange of the pictorial art; and if once our painters could be brought to act upon the recognition of {his trutb, we should have fewer instances -of misdirected effort and manifest shortcoming. Perhaps we may not unfairly attribute to the influence of annual exhibition the diversion of many young painters from the line which their -own bent would have marked out for them into the track 'Which exhibition sales and ex-hibition successes lead them to think, if not the highest, at least the most productive of immediate 'reputation and present profit. There have been times, probably, in wvhich the danger from this misguiding influence was more serious than at preazent. The vogue of Lawrence as a portrait ipainter, or the exclusive worship of the -classical masters in landscape painting, may have b4en more pernicious than the success of Watson '(ordon, or Grant in the one brancli of the art, and 'the influence of the photographer in the other; {but this year's exhibition, like those immediately Fpre6ding it, shows that portrait painters are still apt to fall into imitative mannerism, arid that landscape painters are in no little danger from the dis*coveries of Daguerre and Talbot. if this kind of influence be less observable in the case of the historical and genre painter, 'it may be chiefly -due to the fact that of Iate no historical painter has -achieved success so decided as to mark him out for imitation, and that genre painting is in its nature 3pecisliarly dependent on the bent of the individual mind. Looking at this year's exhibition as a whole, it appears to us rather a hopeful than a brilliant 'One. Some of the members of the Academy, as Eastlake, E. M. Ward, Herbert, Webster, Charles Landseer, andElmore, are unrepresented altogether; -others-as Frith, Egg, and Danby, are represented but inadequately. Leslie and Mulready contributs each only one picture. Holman Hunt sends nothing. There is no lack of the usual eye-sores in the shape of yard-square portraiture, life-size nudities caUing themselves classical, sickly sentimentalities, and studies for landscape pictures intruding themselves as landscapes. But here and -there on this waste of wall, besides worthy works of accredited men, there are essays of rialnw ability and achievements of fresh talent whicK Trender the exhibition of this year interesting if not surprising. To begin with the Academicians. Sir Edwin Landseer has three pictures. Of these the G' Scene in Brae-Mar" (77) is worthy -o take its aplace by the Bide of " The Monarch of the Glen," ' The Stag at Bay," and other works in which the -painter has represented 'the red deer, in what seems if it be not, life size. Slight in exe*eution, but masterly in conception and effect, on the topmost crag of the hiUl a stag stancdn Proudly out against the slaty mountain mist, a hind couchant at his feet; two younger ones of the same herd atand agaze, turned from the spectator, up to where an eagle is bearing off a iamb in his talons, away into the very heart of the cloud, while a mountain hare peers up over the aedge of the granite. Sir Edwin revels in these effects -of boiling wreaths of mint. He has the secret of such skies as he has of the creatures that find their homes among them. But when, as in his " Rough -and Ready" (93), he introduces the same mountain mist as the background for a rather " used-up" -nag, decidedly shaky in his forelegs, turned out to nurse in a straw-yard, we feel inclined to attribute it rather to the laziness of the painter than to the appropriateness of the accompaniment. Looking -at the execution of the straw and railings, and the slovenly making out of the fetlocks and hoofs of the horse, we should be inclined to re-christen this picture " Rough, but not ready." tStill we can forgive much to the pleasant passage that is going on between this winter-coated nao and the fassy black hen who is endeavouring to impress upon him the important fact that she has laid an egg. If all else on this canvass had been painted 4ss well as hen and egg, we might have admired as a picture what we can now only praise as a sketch. The Exhibition is not the place for sketches-even Sir Edwin's. " Uncle Tom and his Wife for Sale " <345) is one of the least objectionable of that class -of Sir Edwin's works in which a human interest is incarnated in the brute. Two Dutch Pugs, of that precious ugliness which makes these animals the very cr-tw de lI cresme of canine aristocracy, are exposed for sale under the shadow of an ugly dog -whip. Uncle Tom-black-muzzled, baudy-legged, the tears in his globular eyes, and his tongue hanging out in abject distress-is chained to the wall, while his faithful c' Dinah," equally black in the muzzle, and more bandy if possible, is gazing up with intense sympathy into the face of her fettered husband. What 1Regent-street dog-sellU, would have the heart to sever such a couple? If there be an elderly spinster rich enough to purchase two pugs, her bowels of compassion must yearn towards This faithful pair, in spite of the prospect <of two prices to pay down on the spot, and two sets 'of rewards to keep paying for the rest of her harased existence. Mulready's single work, " The Young Brother" (138), i. a sweet example of this rmost pure and conscientious of our painters. With a narrow range of colour, and no great reach of invention, Mulready charms by perfection. He has found his style of subject and his favourite lharmonies of colouring, andhe adheres to them. Here he is, as usual, at work among thesweet domesticities of daily life. A girl of 15 stands with her back to the spectator, with an infant in her arms, while her brother, leaning forward, tickles the rosy ear of the little one, who crows and cowers away, its face, its body, its little twining hands all instinct with gleeful life. The bank on which the brother's hand is resting, atree, witha fewyoungaprin-leaves, apepo0f aimplediatance, and a tenderblue sky,withsomeflaes of white cloud, ntake up the whole. But the finish -of every part, the drawing and modelling of the boy's hand, the rounding of the girrs neck and the play of light on her shoulders, the colour, drawing, and composition of the rosy limbs and sweet innocent face of the child, the simple homely happiness of the three, with the appropriate setting of sky and landscape, combine to stamp on the picture the most precious characters of art and sentiment. WVe are ileased to learn that the work is painted for the Vernon Gallery, in pursuance of a direction in the will of its munificent founder. In Mr. Cope's domestic subjects we are glad to recognize much of the same homely, happy feeling which invests Mulready's wrorks with their special <charm. His family group, in " Morning GameS" (172), where a mother is amusing her ittlne. at the play of " Open your month and shut your. eyes," to the immense enjoymnent of an elder girl, and-better stiI-hbis child's- head, in- the -little picture " Affronted" (394), ought to come home to the heart of every mother-or father, too, who has biaheart iu the right place. The last mentioned little lady, we presume, has been playing with her doll -when she ought to have been eating her dinner. Ordered to relinquish amusement for business, she has thrustherdoll in disgustundcerthetablecloth;planted her knife blade f%wards her beside the untasted dinner, and sits with angry uplifted brows, heaving throat, and big tears of wrong rolling down her cheeks-a very impersonation, on an infantine ocale, of offended dignity. We can afford to overlook some disagreeableness in Mr. Cope's mode of painting-owing apparently to the want of half tone, and a free use of pure white lights-in admiration of his truth of expresion -and hearty relish of his subject. HIs merits in their higher points, an well aa his technical imZredtions, are exhibited on a more apparent scale in his large historical picture, " The Departure of. a Puritan Family- for New England." The "Pdgrim Fathe&' have been painted so o*ften that the noble- nature of the subjec can hardly save it frori that liihbo sjeeiallyi conwe erated to " Findings of the Body - HarO47 and "Vicalb of Wakefeld."' But Mr. Cope hasescped conventionality by seriousnes-a serioustess, too, which must enlist sympathy. He has followed tho historical incident ini makinghisPilgrims embarkfrom Delft Haven, whither some of their Dutch hosts and servant-, endeared by their 12. year.' sojourn in Leyden, have followed them, and now look on, a little apart, iu xespectful sympathyj while the sailors shove off the Mayflower's boat, with its Bad . but heroic freight, and their pastor, falling on hig knees upon the sand, iuvokes a blessing on their voyage. The heads of those who stay behind, as well as those of the voyagers, are full of various emotion, wvell-rendered; the minister spreads his hands abroad; rapt and enthusiastic. An old Puritan kneels by his side, pious and selfpossessed; his wife, with closed, but streaming eyes and clasped hancls,dare not trustherself tolook at the boat that bears off her dear ones; behind the pastor is a head where the deep sense of wrong seems to master resignation. It was a happy thought to place the Dutch spectators a little apart. The womanly concern of the servant-girl, unmistakeable as it is, is yet an alien's regret, not a relation'as Aboard the boat is repression rather than outburst of emotion. The young mother has her infant to comfort her go where she may, and her husband is at her side. In the male head of the couple beyond her the only sign of agony is the dilated nostril, and the woman at his side ha taken strength froln his firmness to bear down her tears. But you see them in the swelling of the throat. The children have comforts mixed with their parting regrets. . The lad has already found a plaything in the matchlock he is handling curiouslyperhaps thinking of future use of it against those who have so persecuted his parents. The little girl is more sad, after the nature of her sex. In expression this picture leaves little to desire; in technical execution it would be easy to find fault with it, especially for the tameness of the landscape background, the want of half-tone in the heads, and a certain waxiness of surface wvhich belong to them all more or less. The best painting in the picture is in the sailors who are shoving off the boat. The drawing throughout is careful and firm, without any bravado, and there is in every face an entire absence of grimace. This last remark bringa us to the v.ork which naturally suggests itself for criticism after MLr. Cope's large picture-Mr. Macise's "Peterthe Great Working as a Shipwright in the Dockyard of Deptford" (78). Mr. Maclise's power as a draughtsaman is unequalled by any living artist. His readiness and resource in design are equall remarkable. He can fill up a picture with even lavish expenditure of accessories. He has a keen sense of the picturesque in incident, of the graceful in action, of the attractive in feature. Why is it that with all these qualities-applied, too, with unflaging industryhe yet produces a picture which no honest and competent critic can call in any sense satisfactory ? We should rejoice could we confine our dissatisfaction to technical qualities. Undoubtedly Mr. Maclise's eye is defective in its appreciation of colour, or, with his skdll, he woild not give us these crude and inharmonious hues, equally' disagreeable in themselves, and unfaithful to the truthof objects. Nor does texture redeem colour. His carpenter's bench, his oak stanchlon hiIs Eaw , his heap of tools in the foregrouta are like what they represent. But his flesh, his hair, higs slks and wvoollens, and velvets, are not like hair, or flesh, or any spun or woven fabric ever worn. These faults are, hoivever, quite compatible with the highest merit-expreaion. On this matter taste may varyi but for us Mr. Maclise destroys all his expressons by exaggeration. His personages habitually grimace and attitudinize. They- do so throughout this picture-at least the Russians, from the dwarf who leera up at William from the foreground, to the Menschikoff, Golovnin, Galitzinm or Siberiki, vwhichever it be-who is swinging his adze witlh such portentous power in such dangerous proximity to Peter. William, himself, is the only personage of the group who is not grimacing. His quiet, cool, observing air, with a faint half-smile scarcely traceable on the impassive lips, seems to us happily rendered. Perhaps history warrants Mr. Maclise in making Peter a swaggerer; but we desiderate, and truth to nature demands, in such a crowd more quietude of muscle, more repose of feature, than William's physiognomy supplies, even with the addition of the comparatively composed countenances of Carmarthen and Shrewsbury, who follow their Royal master. Having said thus much of Mr. Malise's picture, we turn with pleasure to the series of d&awings from 'Cs the History of the Conquest," which he has con: tributed to tho Exhibition. In this series-a nineteenth century counterpart of the famous Bayeux tapestry-Mr. MacLse has represented in 42 pencil diawings-of some 8 inches by 24-the history of Harold, from his leavetaking of Edward the o)onifesor, for his visit to Duke William of Normandy, to the discovery of his body by Edith on the field of Hastings. This work fairly challenges comparison with those series of cartoons for frescoes with which Hiubner, Bendeman, and the other leading artists of Prussia, Saxony, and Bavaria have adorned the friezes of palaces and public buildings in Dresden, Berlin, and Munich. Mr. Maclise shows by these drawings that he need fear no such comparison. Drawn, as we are informed they have been, without models, less with a view to exhibition than as the occupation of evening leisure, they exhibit mingular mastery of the figure, extraordinary fertility In invention, and great ingenuity in a rendering of historical incidents, whicb, while purely ideal-i. e., in no sense representative of the events as they might be supposed to have actualy taken place-is yet readily intelligible; which for all its abstractions never deviates into the coldness of asegory, and, however strictly subordinated to symmnetrical rule, yet preEerves throughout dramatic vivacity and movement. The faults of Mr. Maclise's painting are not present here to mar our enjoyment of his various grouping and vigorous draughtsamanship. The ideal treatment imposed by the conditions of the work checks his tenaencyto exaggerated expression. It is little to say that no living Engish artist but himself could have produced these drawings. But few of our painters can draw even reipeetably without the model. But it is high praise in relation to this class of work to Bay that neither Schnorr, nor Bendeman, Hiibner, nor Cornelius could have done more than Mr. Maclise has achieved in this series of drawinag Mr. Dyce's single contribution, " Titian Preparing to make his First Essay in Colouring" (107), represents the boy Titian, at 11 or 12 years old, sitting in an orchard, with flowers in his lap and strewn about him, earnestly turning over in his mind the best way how out of their iuices to extract colours for the esketch he has made in the book beside him from the Madonna, whose statue stands on an old stump in the foreground. The thoughtful expreasion of the boy is well given; dress, flowers, stump, statue, the grams of the field, and the trees that shut it in, are carefully and conscientiously rendered, with a minuteness luite equal to anything with which pre-Rapiaelitism has familiarized us of late years. The finish of Mr. Dyce's workmanship is obtained at the price of some dryness and hardnesw, but the result is in its way complete. Hardness is not predicable of Mr. eslie's one work, "' Sir Roger de Coverley in Church" (213). Dry his workmrhip isapt to be, and it looks even dryer than it is, for Mir. Leslie seorns the eaay but ofteii destructive resource of varnish, aud pamits with a turpentine medium. Nor is Mr. Lesli a colourist.

When you know his pictures you cannot doubt that he is a shIen d, genial, honest, and good-hearted gentle- man. No man, in virtue of this character, is better fitted to appreciate Cervantcs and Addison-the two most gentieman]ike of humourists.

Il |IT-LAlzN OzPXA- ¢ONCBj2ys, CBYST.Ar,-PAACE. The announoement that these attractive entertainments would be renewed gave great satisfaction to the patrons of the C0y58 Palace, and the first of a series of 12 concerts, which took pxce yesterday, brought between 3,000 and $000 persons to the music-room provided for the occasion in the et central transept. The new construction is very smlar In plan to that in which the performances took place last season, the arrangement of the proscenium, with the chorus and principal singers on the stage and the band in the orchestra, being precisely the same. In some respects the former was preferable; but, as the prepsartions for the gleat Handel Festival made a change of site fronithe nave to the transept indispansable, allowances must be miade. The effect of the music, vocal and instrumenal, though good, might still, perhaps, be improved by some guch expodient as was adopted previously for shutting out the concert-room (ai far as practicable) from the rest of the interior, and which tended in a great measur tomodify exce6s of reverberation, an inevitable condition of so vast and peculiwc a building. The bes places for hearing are in the stalls and galleries nearest to the orchestr, which are covered in by a roof of canvsa, and sheltered on either side by adequate contrivances. The general aspect is animated, cheerful, and picturesque; and the idea of a musical fete champare as vividly suggested as before, the feathered tribes - In irofcass amna of unprsmedltated at, taking from time to time even a larger share in the harmo. nious proceedings, and establishing a friendly rivalry which adds to rather than detracts from their charm. The audi. ence were evidently delighted, and the succets of the per. formanels generally was not a bit less than that which crowned the undertakdng lat year. The concert itself calls for little remark. The whole company of the loyal Italian Opera (Marto excepted), with the chorus and the splendid orchestra, in all its pride of number, and efficiency, were called into request. The selection was as follows:- PARTE PllI&A. Orerture-Zauberfllte .. .. .. .. M02a" Aria-" Ah per aempre" (Paritaul), Signor * Ciaian. B ... .. .. . B eliSni. Madriga'-" Who l win my ld f1ir21" ..

To criticize such a progrmme would be superfluous Every piece was as familiar as household words. The lioes sha accorded to Donizetti in the iecond part wa screly balanced by the brilliant orchestal prelude to Auher's best opera, with which it ommenced, and certainly not atoned for by the pompous and noisy Twrceaucensumol of Signor Verdi, which brought it to a close. However, the singers were all in their liveliest mood, and exerted, themselves to the utmost-the indomitable Grial, who appeared three times inPart L (having to sing at night, in As 2.rmatore, to make up the account il, sMlng canap cuous above them l.

E E -2E OP-3ENIZQ OF- aOflvOCATION. * Yederday morning the sual oeremonies necessary to the fornial reassembling of t'ho Convocation of tho clergy took place at St. Pin'ls Cathedral. r The right rev. the bisbops and the clergy of the province who had been cited to attend assembled in the Cathedral a little before 1L The bishops, attired in their convocation robes, entered by the north gate, and tho clergy, in their gowns and hoods, were admitted at the south entrance, The bishops present were-London, St. Asaph, Winchester, Lincoln, and St. David's. The MostRev. thaArclbiahop of Canterbury, attended by his chaplain, Dr. Thomas, and Mr. Felix Kyvett, his secre. tary, arrived at the Chapter-house at 11 oclock, when he was met by the Dean of the Arches (Sir J. Dodson), tho Vicar-General of the Province (Dr. Travers Twiss), accomPanied by the advocxtes and proctom of the Court of Archea. H;B Grace thenceproceeded, atended'by his chap. ins and thecivilians, to the West entrance of St. Pauls, where ho waS received by the Dean and Chapter. - On entering the Cathedral the Archbishop was met by tho bishops and clergy of the province who had assembled there, and who, forming, a procession, conducted his. Grace Up the centre aisle to the deacons' stall in the choir. The bishopsfollowinghisGrace took theirseats on eithersidein the stalls4cf the Canons, the Bishop of London occupying his throne, while the clergy filUed the body of the church. Among the latter were tho Deas of Norwich, Bristol, and St. David's, Archdeacons of Taunton, Bedford, Wilts, Maidatone, Saxam; St. Alban's, Rochester, and Backingham, and .Achdeacon Robinson, (the Maiteg of the Temple), Chanceelor' Mti, 'amd Lord Say and Sele, the Bev.HI Melvill,T. Dale, Dr. Wordsworth,. DrH.Cswell, the Rev. 3ichel Gibbs, the. Rev. H. A. Woodgate, the Rev. EL Mackenzie, the Rev. F. M"enanlberd, the Rev. B. G Baker, the Rev. Dr. M'Caul, the Rev. Dr. Giffith, the Rev. C. Rendolph, the Rev. C. Marshall; the Rev. Dr. Jelf, the Rev. Dr. Jeremie, the Rev. L. MXrcus, the Rev. Dr. .L A. ComilleriL the Rev. Mr. Cheshyre, the Hon. and Rev. Mr. es, the Rev. ;fr. Williams, the Rev. Sir. H. Thompson, Bart., -the Rev. Mr. Hopper, the. Rev. Lord Alwyne Compton, the Rev. Mr. Seymour, the Rev. J. T. Bennett; The litany.of the Convocation was then intoned in Latin, the Right Rev. the Bishop of Lincoln officiating, after which was- sung the anthem, "Oh, pray for the peace of JerualWem." The Latin serm6n *ia then preached, on the appointment of his Grace the Primate4 by the Rev. W. Hayward Cox, B.D., Prebendary of Hereford, and Examining Chaplain to the Lord Bishop-of that diocess. The rev. preacher took his text from the 2d epistle to Timothy, chap. ii; versee24 and'20:- "A;nd the servant of the-Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all meb, apt to teach, patient, in meeknLess instrulctinig those that oppose thmselves; if God peradven- tore wilgive -them repentanc, to the acknow ledging of the- Aftersome preliminary observations, in 'which he took ocason to -refer to the goodwill which he had expe. r;enoed, when recenty representing in Coanvocition the clergy of the diocess of St. David's, at the hands of his brother proctors, 'the preacher, addresaing himself to his subject, remarked that the advantages ol controversy and straggle on religious sdbjects bore generally no propor. tion to the learning and bilty engag6d in them' and this he ascribed not nimply to the unwilingnems of men to be convinced and to relinquish error, but to the manner and spirit mn which controversy was usually conducted, and a,ainst which the Apostle in the text and its context appeared to have for his object to place Timothy on his guard. This spirit,. he observed, was seen principell in tro forms-firs, in the frequent compartive frivolity of the subject-matter of the dispute (" sluias et inerudtcas QUews-tio.^S'); and, secondly, even when fundamentals w5ere under discueson, in'the temper manifested on the part of the disputants. The preacherthen proceeded to con. trast tbe teXing circumstances of the Church of Christ in the apostolic and pnmitive ages with the calm and peaceful position of .the C=Van techer, in the present age and in this country, referrng to the edifice in which he ws addressiog them and to its soleusu round of peaceful services, as marking the difference between the age of the Apostles and that ofthose who were novv assembled in a cathedral dadi' cased to-God in the name of the great Apostle of the Gentiles. While amid these chbages he reminded his hearers of that .wrhich remained unchaged-the duty, undaer far different circmstances, of maintaining a Christian bearing. and the observance of theApostolic maxim-"Theservantof the Lord must not strive, &G. after referrng to several o'her passages in the rame Episle to Timothy, illustrative of the precise error against which the Apostle's warnings were directed, and which he conceived were notto be confsed to the avoidance of Iogomachies, but generally adverse to the spirit ofeligious trifling, asinjurlousbothtothediffusionof ' aknowledge of the trath ar d to the minds of those who opposed themselres," the preacher quoted the introductory chapter of St. Paul's First Epistle to Timothy as supplying a test of sound teaching. 'The Apostle there deprecated the "- giving heed"' to those "fables and endless genesloaes which minitered questions " nd, doptigho m o f aguzeneal, sbjoinie( the- nuear of -Christian charity asad from- "a- are h6 a4d from a good conaslece, and froni fait}i unfeigned." Tnis, then, wa s the touchstone wher6by'wre might dislintguish' profitthle frd5m unprofitable teaching. Deprecating, as he did, that false -charity wrhich would descend to compromise the great essentials of the Christian faith, or to allow the-leaven of these doctrinal errors from which the blcod of martyr had purifed our church again to enter it, he earnestly implored his hearer3 not to give to inferior questions an undue prominence; and thia wrould best be accomp~lished by bearng8 in mind, in their religious struggles, tue "end of ths commandment," charity;* and by a close analysis of the real objects which lay at the bottom of the controversy. TPhey were to ask themselves, ws it party triumph, personal influenLce, or the S aviours caulse which r ally stimulated them? L.amenting, sahe did, the existence of divisions in their communion, and the separation, as regards rites and forms, of very many from that communion whom he, regarded as one with him and them in matters of faish and members of the same fold, of the same invisible, body, he waxs not the advocate of an Epicurean indifference towvards the spiritual state of those who " oppoaed themselves" to unity, but felt the importance of endeavoering to approximate Christians to each other, bearing in mind the rule, " In essentials unity, in accidenfale libcerty-in all things charity." The preacher concluded with a ipecial application of these principles of religious controversy and struggle to the business of Convocation. He noticed the grave questions affecig many of them v.ry deeply-the well-being of the Establishment, and (others) the highest interests of society. Suchu were the religious and secular education of the people, the revis'on of the present version of the Bible and of our chinch services, measures of Christian and of'civil liberty, the selations of Church and State (expressing here an opinion that the carrlag out the idea of sciarateon in its eomplatencss won Id imp air the rights of Dissentbrsno less thau of Charchmen), and (finally) thq constitution of Convocation itself. As regards the latter question he urged instant attention, dwrelling forcibly on the perilous character of the position in whEich Convocation wras at present placd He raminded his hearers that at present they could do no more than deliberate-that they wrere writhout the power of enacting canons. He, for himaell heartily desired a nearer approximation to th representative character of ou r civil legislature in the constitution of their Synod-impressing on them that unless the Laity had a voice In the selection of those dlergymen who might be sent as members to Convocation thay could not expect sympathy or deference on the pat of the Christian public. But with this niodifiica- ton he could anticipste a bright future ftor the Church, in contrast-to its history, wFhen at the Revolution-the period of civil liberty bursting forth on the people-it wFas thought neeessary to silence thte ambitious tone and factiousneSs of Convocation itbelf. Be concluded with commending, under these circumatanees, gentleness, moderation, forbcearance, caution-reminding the Houses that they wrere as a city set on a hill which could not be bid, and with a prayer that by the maintenance of a Christian deportment and a sense of! their pete respmonsibilities they might lead more and more of "those WhO oppose themselves"' to *kmldeo the truth as ib was in Chis Jesu, anoldef At the conclusoion of the sermon, which was listened to writh earnest attention, the " Gloria int Eixcelsis" was sung, and the Archbishop, closed the service by pronouncing the benediction in Latin. His Grace; then, attended by the other members of Convocation, returned in procession to the Chna-Xer-house, wrhen, the Upper HIouse b)eing seated, the Vicar-General p resented the (eueen's writ for summoning Convocation. His Grace thereupon, directed the Registrar to read it, which having been done the Bishtop of London, as Dean of the Province oE Canterbury, returned the Archbishop's mandate, writh his certificate thatit had been dulyexercised. TheVicar-Generai then preasnted the return froma the diocese of Nor-wich (the see of Norwich being vacant) wvith a like certificate. These having been read aloud the registrar preconized the bishoptt mentioned in the return from the dean of tho province, and the Archbishop referred to tce vscar-ueneral to report upon the certificates trasmnitted by them and upon the letters of proxy.

Severil sugar estates have recently changed hands at very Food prices. The weather had been dry during the tor5ight, with occasional showers. Vegetation exhibited a marked improvement, and the young cane3 were recovering from the chilling effect, of the previous weather. The cholera still lingered in some of the rural districts; but it was evidently dying out. A proclamation wMs isued by the Governor on the 7th inst., founded on the report of the Surgeon-General, the chairman of the Central Board of Health, declaring that the cholera had ceased to exist in the port and city of Georgetown. Tte exports from the colony during the fortnight were avs follows, - Sugar, 1,172 hhds., 77 tierces, 48 barrels, 37 bags; rum, 510 puneheons, mU hhds,, 35 barrels - molasses, 74 puncheons; flour, 400 barrels; meal, 108 barrels; corn, 108 barrels; old metal, 80 tons; crackers, 198 barrels; rice, 4,407i bags; timber, 7,035 feet; pork, 95 barrels; cigars, 4,000; cocoa nuts, 3,000. Sugar making was being pushled on vigorously at St. Vincent under a favourable change of weather. Advices from St. Lucia are to the 11th of April. The excessive wet weather had changed to bright sunshine, and the planters had commenced reaping with all speed. This year's crop was expected to be about an average one. The prices of colonial produce were bighly satisfaetory. Molasses commanded in the local market l1d. to .i. a-gallon. Sugar found a ready sale at 20s. to Ss. per cwt.; rum, 2s. per gallon proof. Cocoa was bought up at 4d. to 5d. per lb. as soon as it could be brought into town. Logwood fetched 32s. per ton; the sale had not been as brisk since the lasi advices from home. The supply of tonnage was abundant; freights to Eng and, 2s. 9d. to 3s. per cwt. Somo matters of importance had been decided by the Island Legislature. The Board had provided a salary for the Deputy-Registrar of 200. perannum, and the question, raised for the first time in the island, of granting a pension to a public servant, had been decided in the affirmative. A majority of the Council declared that any public offlcer who serves the (lovernmuent faithfully hall receive, when incapacitated by old age or infirmity, one-half of the salary to which he 'was entitled when in the active discharge of his duties. The Board had also received at the hands of G,ovemor Hineks an act of justice in discontinuing the payment for extra clerkago in Barbadoes.

FORBIGCN INTELLIGENCE. S - , -- PRANCE. JApo on Of the following appewed in our wCoad SIatj f_ . _iP-.- (lomI OUR OWN COORMPONDENT.) PARIS, TauVRSAY, ArRm 30, 6 P.M. Tke Grand Duke Constantine arnived here this afternoon at 5 o'clock, and passed along the Boule. vards at half-past 5. He was received at the railroad station with the caremonial described in my letter of Tuesday, and from which, I believe, there has been no deviation. Several of the houses along the Boulevards were decorated with flags, in whioh the Russian colours were mingled. From 3 or 4 o'cock the great thoroughfares leading to the Lyons Railway Station were crowded with the curious, who vrere anxious to catch a sight of a real Russian Prince, particularly of one to whom popular report atibuted thesternerfeatures of his family. The Grand Duke sat in an open carriage drawn by four horses, with Prince Napoleon on has left. wothwere in uniform, the Grand Duke as an Admiral, with a blue riband and star. Prince Napoleon wore the dreas of a General of Division, and displayed the grand riband and star of the Legion of Honour. The carriage in which thoy were sea.ted pased along at a walking pace, so that a good view was had of the Dule by the people, who thronged the footwaya and the balconies of the houses. The day was rather cold, but otherwise fine, aud the two Prnces were enveloped in cloaks, which were thrown back at the shoulders. There was no cheering on the Boulevards, but the spectators in the streeta saluted by taaking off their hats as the carriage passed, and the Grand Duke acknowledged the salute by touching his cocked hat with his open hand. Indeed, he ceased hardly for a moment returning the salute. he carace mn which the Prlnces rode was preceded tby a detachment of Guides, and officers belonging to the Imperial household rode on both sides. Another carriage followed, with the functionaries who received him at the railroad station ; in a third were deposited the ponderous peson of Marshal Magnan and the more slim forsn of his aides-decamp; and a fourth conveyed the Ruiai2n officers of the suite of the Grand Duke. The rear was brought up by a squadron of Guides. It was parbaps owing to the coldness of the day that neither the Grand Duke nor the Prince wore an expresion of much animation. The Russian Prince is rather a mild-looking young man. He is of fair complexion, with small light vwhisker and a thin fnr moustache. The Princes proceeded to the Tulleries by thea Rue Roysle at the same slow pace. Prince Napoleonl received thle DOuke ati t;he railw7ay station, but did not, as I stated he would not, go to Toulon to meet If the Grand Duke had postponed his entry into Paris but seven days from the present date it would have been the anniversary of the vist of lhia ancestor Peter the Great to the sae capital Very nearly 140 years ago, that is, on the 7th 1717, Peter drove to the Palace of the Louvre with the Princes Kouraldn and Dolgorouki, Baron Schafferoff, the Ambassador Tolstol, and other high dignitaries of his suite. The ceremonial and etiquette, as then practised at the French Court, displeased and annoyed him. He refused to be lodged in the splendid apartments of the Palace prepared for him and his attendants, and, having gruffly paid his compliments to his entertainers, he went on icotthe same evening to the extreme end of Pads, and tookuphisquixtsrsattheHoteldesaediguibres,which belonged to the Marshal de Villeroi The expanses of his living were of course defrayed by the country. On the following morning the Regent Duke of Orleans visited him at his lodgings; and the day after the Kfing, Lous XV., then only seven years old, was conducted by his governor to see the man whose genius, whose eccentricities, and whose barbarous manners astonished all Europe. Two days eLsapsed before Peter returned the Royal visit; the interval was occupied in receiving the authorities and corporation of the city. His visit to the Kig was paid at night, and it is saed that, to Cut short all difficulty about precedence, Peter carried the Royal child in his arms for some time. The Czar's journey to France was not that of an Idle tourist; he desired to gain knowledge, no doubt, but political motives were, perhaps, those which chiefly actuated him. is Mi rs at the Hague bad previouslyhadseveral secret interviews withthe intriuer Gortz, the secret agent of Charles XI[. of Sweden. Gortz had done his beat to bring together the Swedish Monarch and the Czar and prevent the war, to restore Stanislaus to the throne of Poland, and to deprive George I. not merely of Bremen aud Verden, but even of the throne of England. Peter, we are told by his moBt admiring historian, was particularly desirous of ascertaining in person on what terms the Regent of France really was with the King of England, and whether George was firrly seated on the throne. EI one respect the visit of the Prince who has entered Paris this evening reminds us of that of Peter. The Grand Duke will negleet no opportunity durig his stay of acquiring information on that important point, and of doing his utmost to Improve the good understanding which M. de Moray no doubt believes he has successfully commenced at St. Petersburg. I do not know whether he will seek for information, as his ancestor did, about the stability of the British Throne, but we may be sure he will hint no doubts about the peaceable transmission of the Imperial Crown of France to a fourth Napoleon; and will also satisfy himself as to the natureof the relations between the two Governments of France and England. In 1782 Paris was honoured with visits from another member of the Imperial fam1ly of RuEsiaone who was more fit for seclusion than a throne, and who perished violently. In that year the Grand Duke l'aul Petroviteh, the supposed son of that strange compound of crime and talent, Catherine II., visited Paris. Paul was then married to his second wife, a Princess of Wurtemberg, niece of Frederick the Great, and they both travelled incognito,-which means that every one knew who they were,-under the title of Countand Countess du Nord The atorm that eight or ten years later burst over FDance was then gathering darkly; the clouds were charged with thunder, and, amid the revels of a careless Court and a frivolous and profligate nobility, the flashes in the distance indicated its rapid approach. The Count and Countess du Nord were received with the politeness which half redeemed the vices of the upper classes, and which contrasts with the assumption of the "great men" of this day, who have been enriched, or who have been dragged up from obscurity of late years. The Count d'Artois, afterwards Charles X, then occupied the villa called Bagatelle, where the present Emperor loves to pass a morning occasionally with its proprietor, and the Gran d Duke Paul was a frequent visitor. Then there were the breakfasts at Sceaux with the Duke de PonthiRvre, and suppers at Chantilly at the Palace of the Prince de CondO, whose last descendant perished mysteriously in 1831. Paul PetroVitch and his wife had to undergo the ceremonious visits of the Grand Almoner the Grand Master of the Household, the GrauA Chamberlain, the Grand Equerry, Grand Pantler, Grand Huntaman, and the other embroidered trifles tnat warmed in the anteeiambers of Vermailles, and helped, like the same costly encumbrances of our day, to exhaust the treasury. I Euppose the Grand Duke Constantine will have to go through the same infliction; he may, however, eonxide himself fortunate if he escapo the haranouen of what ara called "the constituted bodies.' The famous Meaner, tho inventor or disoverer of animal inagnetism, was then in Paris, as alsothe no lea famous charlatan Cagliostro. They both waited on PaulL; the ono propo3ed to magnetize him, the other to evoke the spirt of his father-.whicli Paul declined. If his grandson, Constantinle, wishes to know somethzing about charlatans, he will find that the family has wronderfully increased, though the general population may have diminished. The Roanof-i weare not in general a very edifying race, but if the Grand Duke has any curiosity to see the shades of Peter, Elizabeth, Catherine, Paul, or the other amiable specimens of humanity, here is the celebrated medium Hume -who, it is said, has returned purposely to Paris in case his Imperial Highness may want him. This is not the first time the Grand Duke has been uponl his travels. In 1839 his father sent him on a tour; he visited the prnzcipal States of Europe, with the exceptionof France,whoae Sovereigthe:Emperor NKicholas disliked and a;ffectedS to undervalue. T!he Gand Dake was recognized in the beginning of the late war as one of the chiefx- of the oldRu part, and it war he who, an High Admiral and ior -in-Chief of the MiiWry of Marlne, was charged with the organization of the defence of Cronsadi and the Baltio coast agains Sir Charles Napier. He is said to howell-Wnforend fadfond of letters, but, what is rathr sange, ha but little priity for the cviliztion of the Wet. HIs is h first friendly iit of a R;an Princ dnce that of-oin grandfather-Paul; for, in pite of -his declaration that lecame only as their. friend, and in spite of 4Russi influences"the mass of the French people do not yet regad the entry of Alexander in 1814 as a "1 friendly visit." I heard two or three days ago that the Presse would, on thie ver day of the Grand Duke's entry, contain an article on the English alliance, and that ia article 'would be, if not written, at all events inspired, by 5 personage of exalted rank, whose dilike of all that is Ru an is very strong. The article has appeared-in the Presse of this evening, and the paper began to be sold at-the very moment the Grand Duke -wFas pasing. It begins with this phrase . "Tho alliance of England and France is one of the fundamental bazes of European civilization. The day it is seriourly distrbed * th saame blow will disturb the entire edifice We muBt then, take caeo to lay a hand on that corne stone, for its fal would be alike fata to both countries. The community of their interests is evident, and it is the blind only who will not recognize it. Whoever eecs and undestnds mun not aZlow his eyes or hs to be divertedfrom this great objdct by p rtt i obstacte This is the concluding pasage - "Democratic France is the ally of free England.

(3,800,0001.), a nd that the avrge as 44,000,0001, (1,760,00QL); in addition, it gavt imar accommodation to railway securitiee, en one otcasion to the extent of 29,000.0001. (1,160,0001.), the ave being 15,000,000f, (600,000o.) for efrep fortnight; in fact,th t eotal of all uch Isums furished in 1a856 not les than 703,000,000f, t28,120,000f.); and when at lst the restrictive measures of tha Bankd of England tad hFante led tea cllss lathe money-market, the efforts of the Credit olobilier tended not a little to facilitate the tnsition towards easier times. When the moment of difficulty arrived (says tho rei port) the Crdt obilier not only did not diminish tha credits which It was aocustomed to make to railway enter prises, but even anumented them; my, more, it offered officially two things :-lst., to purchase, with the co-operation of several foreign houses, the enthe whaich the Bak of rance possesed, so as to furneis that esotblihment with the means of efficaciously augmentng ito metalic re erve, and of continuing itg advances onllenteuand railtway ihares and, 2d, to provide for the wants of *al the tail way comp3nios byu subscribing to the extent of 300,000,000 francs (tl,000,000ou) for the loans wech they had to issue in 1867, the Clrdlat Mobilier and i. directors declarig that theoy were ready to engage themslve personally for that urpose to the amount of 200,000,000e .the rcemainder of lOO,000,000£f.ws subscribed for by the other banking-houe. These two propoition o remained vithout sult, and the Cr4dit Mobilier being forced to renounce every combined measure a obliged to onlne its2elf to providing for the nts of the counc whoso businever it was In the habit of acng; bt it had formed a correct judguent of the sotnatmon, and the sole fact of it. having male tho proposition alUded to contbuted inno small degree to caim dowTndieqitude,to strengu^npubllc feeling, and to demonstrate that unfounded teror had been too easily givn wy to. The crisis, although conjured awy, bad not lesathoeffect of reducing In abvery stridng manner the profit on which the company thought itelf entitled to reckon an co quence of the imped amolioration of credit" The report then touches on the several enterprisee which the company had aimed at chrryin out on Its owu account, and states that of Its railway proects that of Grenoble to St. Raebert, towards Lyetn and Valence, had been santioned by dmterial decree in March, 1857. The Transatlantcic packets still remaained undecided, but therewa every reason to beleve that the quesation would be before long settled in a manner to satisfy all the interests involved ip it; and the company had established a regular intercourse writh the Credit Mobilieb of Spain, and would take part in the construction of the Spanish railways. The report then speakrs of the insufflciency of the capital of the Bank: of France for the vastly increased business of the countr1and then examines the question of how its capital could beet be doubled in order to meet its enlarged sphere of action,anddeclaresthatwvhen theproper time arrives it will give the preference to bonds at short date. The report then touches on the financial situation ofE the company. Its transactions in cash during the yearhadanxotutedto 3,085,195,1 76f. (123,4N7,8071.); ito accountcrent with the Bank tol,216,686,271jf (48,667,4511.); the company had received payments on 1,455,264 railway shares and bonds, producingf 160,976,590f. (6,439,0641.), and had paid, either for itself or for other companies, on 4,986,304 coupons of sihares and bonds. The totaI of the pronft ot the year was 15,249,981f. (609,9991.)) which would give a dividend of 116f. per shae, or 23 pr con.t for tihe year 1856. emeeting gave it approval to the repmot, and adopted the dividend proposed, anld the proceeding then terminatedd SWITZERLANDi AND PRUSSIA. A telegraphic despatch fromBerne, dated the 29th of April, states that on that day the Swiss Fcederal Council authorized the signing of the treaty for the settlement of the NeWh6tel queBtion on the conditions drawn up by the Conference at Paris. Another telegraphic depatch from Berne, dated 30th April, adds:- " The Federal Council has decreed the immediate publication of the treaty, s also of an annexed protocol, adding to it the tenour of the origlmi demands of prusla and the first instructions given to Dr. Kern." AUSTRIA. (FROD oun OWN con EPONDDT.) VIENNA, APPm 28. A few days ago a deputation of three out of the four "Superintendencies" of the Hungarian Calvinist had an audience of the Emperor during which M. von Loiyal read an address in the Hun- garin lage he fourth SiSupetintencdency," which ha e ngement of the Calvinist communities on this dle of the Theisg, intends to preset a separate addre to His Majesty. 3. von LonYal Wau e1tremely verbos, but the ppers state that the Emperor listenedtDjamuit geto em tlse.

The EmperorrepliedinthHungarianlanguage as follows:_ " I WMll carefully examine into the merits of your pati. tlIon, and after having done so I will consider in how far your wihes can be complied with. I sincerely desire the 'Welfare of my subjects of tho Helvetic confession, and expeat from them in retum full confidence and loyal attoh. inent.Y It is to be seen by the Hungarian papers that tha Protestants fully expect to be permitted to manage their schools as they were formerly accuatome i to do, but they - certainly deceive themselves. The object of Government, as is to be seen in tha Concordat, is gradually to diminish the number o. its non-Catholi aubject, and this can be most effectually done by aubjecting the Protestant children to the influence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. At present some few Protestants fill high offices in the State, but the rising non-Catholic generation hs no chance of obtaining employment, except ia the aTmy, and even there only in the lower grades. Persons who have just arrived frora hlungary state that the preparations which arG being made for the reception of their Majesties are far beyond the means of the communities, many of which are sadly in asrear with their rates and taxes. The country is still suffeing from tne effect of the "voluntary" National LoaI, and His Majesty will have no choice but to disply as much generosity to his Hungarianas he did to his Itiakn rubjactr.. It is said tit, notwithstanding the heavy ttxrtion, the revenue ftceived from Hungary isn5t much greater now than it va in former times. "The outlay for coUeeting the taxes and for maintaining the host of employ6s;' aid my informant, s" is so great that there is, probably, marvellously little difference between the revenue and the expenditure." During the Last day or two there has been a panic on 'Chlange, and experienced financiers are. of opinion that it baa not yet reached Its climax Various causs have contributed to produco the extreme depreesion which prevails here. 1. Baron Bruck has displayed more. energy thax judgment, and has7 brought too many ldnds of ndustrid stock into the market at one and the same time, but still he has considerable difficulty in making up his mind to hold his hand. 2. The publio has disecovered that it is folly to pay a premium onsharesin railroads which have not been commenced, when it can buy National Loan scrip, beaig per cent., payable in silver at 84-i. 3. The ational and Credit Banks are likely to glve notice to the owners of soma kinds of deposited stock that the seurity In their hands Is not considered sufficient, and tUt the money ad. vanced onitx it be called in. 4. Somekindsof endust,W stock, such for instance as Northern Railroadshares,haabeensold at'ery low price the holders being in want of money for the fourth insalment on Credit Bank shares, which mut be 1idbefore the lot of May. 5. The approaching ssue of 600,000 Rusian railroad shares, which cannot but exercise a very depressing influence on al the continental money-markets. Some of theVienna bankers have been obliged to take shaes in the Rusaian railroads, but they know full well that they will never be able to dispose of one of them here. In Prague but one subscription of importance has been made, although some of the papers tell a very different story. A cordon has been drawn round Galliel and Moravia, where the murrain is raging, so that no cattle can be driven to Bohemia or Lower Austia. The frost has nipped the cherry, early pear, and apricot trees, WhiCh were in full blossom when the weather changed so suddenly. The air is somewhat less cold than it was, but sill the weather is as wlntry as it generally is at the beginning of November. The panic on 'Change was far greater to-day than it was yesterday. The National Loan was as low as 83 1616, and Eive per Cent. Metaliques, were at 82. Credit Bank Shares were at 24. The premium on gold was 7,, on silver Q~. SARDINI (rRON OU3B OWN O} 5PlDRN.) TURIN, APRiL 27. The streets of Turin begin just now to exhibit those eccentricities of codume which are a sure indication at thii time of year that the winter flight of migratory British is on the wing homewards, and as this is certain before very long to be succeeded by another of summer tourists, whioh will th' year be larger than usual, probably, in eonsequence of increased facilities of travelling, it will not be amiss, erhaps, to warnour eountymen of the stte of the skingdom regarding the introduction of tobacco, because a strict attention to its provisions may save a vast deal of time and temper, and some expense. As an instance of the inconveniences arfiing from inattention to or ignorance of these regulations, which are rigidly enforced, an Engliih gentleman recently incurred a fine of 600f. and the seizure of his cigars for attempting to pass 80 cigars without declarin; them at the gates of Turin, and the authorities were with some difficulty induced to zeduce the fine to 5Of. on satisfactory proof being giveuthat the gentleman had no frudaulent intentions, and that he was In complete ignorance of the laws of Sardinia on this head. It should be mentioned also that all travellers are hable to have their baggage searched on entering Turin, and the presence of cigars and tobacco therein which have not paid duty will bring the proprietor within the action of the following law, although he may himself have purchased the articles within the Sardiuian States, the only security against which is to buy always at the registered shops for the sle of such Goovernment monopolies, and not from waiters or other vendors of smuggled goods. The law of July 11, 1853, says:- "Asrt. 23. Whoever is fonnd in possion of foreign tobacco, in whaterer quantity, tnless he can justify the payment of duties in conformity with a-tlcTr 3 of the law of February 5, 150, by prodnuing the n5cessary Custom? receipt, which reoeipt shall not bo valid unless it be deliveredin his name, and if it be dated more than four months back, shall be deemed in contravention of article 2 of the Royal edict of June 25, 1816, and shall be subjeat to the penalties imposed bytho subsequent artldo 43 of that 'Art. 24. The enactments of the foregoing articles are equally applicable to Havannah cgs, con emp 1d by the Cameral Manifesto of the 7th of April, 170. (rIcls 11,12, and 13.) " Art. 25. The payment of duty upon 2obacco which may be imported by travellers byth5 terms of the second line of article 3 of the aforesaid law of the 5th of February, 1850, must be substantiated by the production of theCustomhouse receipt, made out in the name of the party holding the tobacco, which recipt will not be valid after the exIoration of one month from the date thereo£" On the 15th of next month it is expected that the railway from Macon to Geneva will be opened to the public as far as Culoz or Lessell on the Rhone, and from the former place to Aix-le-Bairn there will be a service of steamers in connexion with the railway trains of both the French and Savoy Rilways. The steamer voyage down the LAke of Bouget will occup about two hours only from Culoz to Aix-les%ain", and thus there wi be a continuous steam transort from Par in this dircotion, as far as St. Jean de Maurienne, and the journey from Paris to Turin and vice versd Will be made in 28 or 30 hours without difEculty. If the English Government could succeed In ar- ranging a powtal convention with France for the transmission of seaed bags for this country, we might hope to get our letters from England in 48 hours at the outside; but, strange as it may appear, the French Government hais always insted on a delay of 12 hours or so in the French capital for the Anglo-Italian mail, and, notwithxtanding the very cordial entente exiting between the Imperial Government and those of England audi SardinL, I am much afraid that this obstacle will not easily be removed. It is said to-day in Turin that the Government has decided on dissolving the Municipal Council of Genoa in consequence of the measure adopted by it in the dispute on the taxation question. Noi commissioner or commimion has yet been named for executing the duties of Syndie. Mr. Bright the apostle of peace, is here at present, and has, I understand, already visited Coant Cavour, on whom it is anticipated he will make a groat impresion. The whole of the members of the former Sardinian Legation at Vienna have now returned to Turin A Genoa paper says that in the Liguria, in the neighbourhood of Voltri, the epidemic prevailing among cattle in the north of Europe had been manmfested in several inxtanoe The natives had given It the name of "lebbra;" and the milk of cows a-. fectedbyItwas sourand uufitforume, andno one daed to eat of the meat of beat that had shown symptoms of the malW,y.

.THE COSTA UCTION OF A i7D AxusKT TO THE EDITOR OF TEEE TIE. Sir,-Having been associated by tho Government with Mr, Whitworth in maling those priments of which te rifle recently tried at Hythejs the result, you will, perhps, permit me to make a few observations Os the subject. I do so, because Ium apprebensivothe discuseon may become mixed p swil irrelevant matter. The subject in no way relates, or Is necessarily connected either wit the educ tion of tho soldier, his powrers of Vng thbe ,pon, it effct on artillery, or any other brnch of the service.

This arose not.rom fear of the enemy, or from thelimite supply of food (at lest in the earlier satof the g), but from the inten dread whichthe soldion had of pasing anotherwinter in aram The de,. aters simply aimed at returning to their ille andiseldom attempted to go over to the enemy; but they didthisto such an extent-as many as4O going off st atimne-that itwas neesary to take stringent measures to checl them. Several were caught and shot, and otin persona in the town, who we found to make a regua busines of asising them, were verydeservodlyandjudiciously hanged. It is remarkable that, as General Wiam stated in hs despatch to Lord Clarendon, no Christian subject of the Sultan betryed them, but those who so Judt1 forfeited their lives were all of them 3Muwilmans The celebrated Schamyl, "Prince of Daghistan, erroneously called the Circasian Chief," wa oerPected for some time to make a useful diverion, and some oorrespondenle between him and General Willams is given at pages 163-4 But Coloel lake di ges his capacty to do anything effective beyond the range of his mountain fast neaeJs and adds, moreover, that he had opportunely received bacl from St Poterburg his lost son, at thLt time a Rnuian officer, attched to the institations or Ruias, and accutomed to a civilizea life. The latter "h ad been received with Ifinite joy by his father, who accepted, no doubt, 'with a corresponding pleasure a large sum of Rnussia gold whuih accompanied this long wished. for retuffion of his first-born" Colonel Lake infors from the conduct of Schamyl during the war as well as from more reent events that he ha been greatly overrated by the British public, and that the purny of his motives isby nomeana unimpeachable. e is ap&Iarently indifferent to the distat chance of thehief of Daghist employingsome of his Rusian gold to xustain an action for defamation. On the other hand, we are pleasd to observe that the highest pie is awarded to General Knety on various occamion (Ycde pp. 12S, 200, 201, 229, &c.); while in the controversy as to the judgment of General Wiliams in lecting to hold iKas at a4 Colonel Lake very naturally sdes with his cief. HEe contends that Kars was a far stronger postionthan Erucroum, and that there was every reason to believoit might havo been defended succesgfully. Had it been determined to retire before the enemy at any period during the blockade, the whole of the heavy garrison artillery must at once have been abandoned. " It may appear almost incredible, but so utterly destitute Wu the &rmy of anything like transDort that about 20 abas formed the whole of that department. Hence all the stores and magazines must have been destroyed or left for the enemy to take posesion of." The Turisih army, moreover, had been taught to look upon this position astheirsafeguardandstronghold, and, disorganizedas they were by a succesion of defeats for three years pat, it wrould have been hopeless to expect them to face their enemy in the field. If they left Kars, the first position which they could have taen up would: have been on the Soghauli-Dagh, hut espe rience has shown that mountain ridges are for the moot prt untenable, and a retreat from this point would have thrown some most available resources, including three psakaliks, into the hands of the enemy. Tho "gso called position of KupriEKeui" Colonel aIke maintains to be utterly indefensible, so that nothing remained, if tbe retreat at once commenced, but to fall back on the Dev6-Boynou pass, where,owing tothe I procstination ofthe Turkx, only one imperfectbattery and put of an unfinished redoubt existed. General Mouravieff with his superior force, could have held them in check here, aud, by entering the plain by the other route with a portionof his army, could have plae them between two forces, ach equal to their own, and have forced them to retire into Erzeroum. The unfavourable disposition of the population of this latter place the Colonel coniders sufficient to have prevented its succesful defence. ccBemonl Er roum thesre was no force of any ka to opps the further progres of the Rusian armny, and the whole of AsIA Minor would have at onco been in their hands.' These conclusions are, perhaps, summary, and they leave out of sight the practicability of the route between Trebizonde and Erzeroum, on-which Colonel L31e insits irhilo criticizing the campaign of Omar Psaha. The possibility of receivingreinforcementaby way of the former, ancl the effect of a Turkish army, either in poition on the mountains,, or in Ardahn, with the impossibility of following up its retreat if defeated, appear to us mateial circumstances in the consideration of this obh.cure question, thou_hgwe may not doubt the importance of Colonel Lake's observations; and still less do we wish to disnub his conclusion that "as long as history ahf be read and the art of war cultivated by ankind the name of will bo a rallying point to all true Soldiers." * NIarrat I of fhe Defene of rars, H!oric? and MMU tary, by Colonel AtweU Loke, C., && fltut*d. b : lientezunt-Colonel O.Teda, C.B ndW-9UAraWMp9z Eaq.

The contents of tho mysterious boxes which, it will be recollected, were e{poken of in a former Btage of this long, angrily conducted, and ruinously expensive litigation, aridng out of the marnrage between a barrister of 55 or 56 years old with a vidovw lady ofoctogenarianexperience,% bavg ceen ransacked, arranged, and too copiously copied, when opened, disclosed evidence in support of the contention of the plaintifi's couusel, that a ceatra.t did exist between the parties in addition to that already published. The needle thus searched for in the bottle of hay is represented by the following extracts: F;rom heh Lady to the gentlean dated the 31st of August, Would it not be de irable that i should sbeow the reush draught of the settlement sent here to one ronEdential Person on my Dar This, rfac,toz.v could be returned to You, and be ready agai mY bslaL In teun ana EaVe me MUch annoyaneo, tor I know, no o:e in Leaden to whom I wish to apply, and here I Knowa oue Vezzo But I ought to mee the rough draught here quietly end by mysel, and wil return it to you by the return."

VICE-CHANCELLORS' COTMTS. MAY 1. umTRlt=lyaT' zV -- -R (Before Viex7ChanceUor Sir JoHN STUAuT.1 This =as the petition of the Rev. George Edward Her. bert, one of the defendats in the above SEit, psaying that anl further proceedings in the suit might be stayed, and that the plaintiffs might be ordered to pay the costs of all parties, and that the sums of 1,4141. 8s. 7d., 3 p cent. Consols, and 591. 8s., cash now in court, might be paid to the petitioner as the leal personal repre. sentative of Richard Athelstan Herbert, a captaiu in the East India Company's service, who died in India on the 16th of November, 1848. On the 20th of September, 1849 (it being then supposed that Captain R. A. Herbert had died intestate), letters of administration to his estate and effects were granted to the first defendant, the Rev. John Athur Herbert, by the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. On the 9th of August, 1853, the bill in this cause was filed by Mr. and Mrs. Mirehouse against the defendants, of whom the petitioner was, as before stated, one, for the administration of Captain II A&.Herbert'spersonal estate, and on the hearing of the cause on the 241ih of April, 1854, the Yice-Chancellor ra-ndeo the usalE decree for the administration of an intestateos personaloestate. The petitioner was ropzesented at the hearing by counsel. It appearcd that Captain R. A. Herbert; addresised to the petitioner a letter dated on the day of the Captain'sdeath, and which was ultimately, in November, 1855, established as a nuncupativa will, such wills being by the 1st of Victoria, chap. 26, section 11 declared to bevalid when made by soldiers "in actual military service, or mariners or seamen "being at sea." In May, 1856, the letters of administration granted to the defendant. J. A. Herbert, were revoked, and in Februlary, 1857, adninistration with the w ill annexced was granted to the petitioner, Bly that will Captain HIerbert grave 1,0001. to one of his brothers, the first defendant tJohn A. Herbert) and the residue of his property to the petitioner. The only qu estion was as to the CostS of the suit. The bill contained narges of evasion, delay, contradictory and incorrect accounts, and of novel and untenable claimts as being imputable to the defendant J. A. Herbert, but at the hearing the plaintiffs asked only for the ordinary administration .decree, which was made. Mr. Wioxirss, in sapport of the petition, contended that, the administration suit had been entirely useless to his client, vwho was entitled to the whole residuary fond in court under the wrill, and that the fund ought not to be charged with any coats of the suit, and narticularly that it ought not to be charged writh the coats of a very hostile litigation occasioned by the plaintiffs and the long pleadings and proceedings incident thereto, MIr. MLLN.S and MIr. KARSLAIE:, for the defendant J A. Herbert, the administrator, contended that he was entitled to have his costs from the plaintiffs personally on account of the charges made against; him, and which bad entirely failed and had been abandoned by the plaintiffs themselves at the hearing. Mr. BACON and Mr. JoliN HIN2DE PALMEFR, for the plalntiff were willing to submit to an order to stay further proceedtings in the snit without p)aying or receivngncosts, alleging that allparties had ace under a common error caused by the petitioner himself, who had not until a comparatively recent period ever supposed the letter of the Captain to be a testamentary document. The VICZ C&HACELLOR, after a full review of the ori eumnstances of the case, said that the costs of the suit were owing to a common error occasioned by the petitioner himself, who now sought to obtain out of court the fund realized by the proceedings in the suit without payment of the costs of realizing it. He should make an order for payment of the costs of all parties relating to this petition out of the fund, and for payment of the funds in court to the petitioner, and for a stay of further proceedings in the suit.~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~t (Before Vic-Ciancdl.or Sir W.

COJBRT OF QUEEN'S BENCE, WBsTMN8sTEI, MAY 1. _ SAUNDERS (CLERK) V. HOWES AND ANOTHE. muztng tn Jianco, before Lord CAMPBELL and Jwfica WIGETMAN, ERLs. and CRomrToN.) .Lns was a specia case torthe opinion of the Courb. The plaintiff was the Rev. John Saunders, the rector of St. Luke's, Middlesex, and the defendants, Messrs. Howes and Moreland, were the churchwardens of the parish. The action being brought, a case was stated by consent for the opinion of the Court upon the question whether the plaintiff, as rector, was entitled to receive from the churchwardens and overseers, or the guardians of the poor, or their treasurer, or the vestrymen of St. Luke's,the annual sum of 1201,, in conformity with the provisions of the 6th of George II. The statuto in question was passed for providing a maintenance for the rector of the new church near Old. street, in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegaoe, and for making that part of the said parish which was called the "klordship" part a distinct parish, and for empowering the commussioners for building Onew chrches to apply a SUm of money to war in the sdid church and chrchyard and to erect a house for the habitation of the rector of the said church out of the money appropriated for the endowment of the said 5 ntew churches. The parish of Sts Luke was established under that Act, and it now contains a population of more than B0,000 persons. The plaintiff became rector in the year 1844, since which time he had resided in the parish, but there was no provision for his maintenance, except thatmade in the saidstatute, or referred to in the preamble. The defendants were appointed churchwardens at Easter, 1854, and continued in office till Easter, 1855. Burials in the parish were discontinued after the 1st of January, 1854. Up to that time the annual suxm of 1201. had heen paid by the churchwardens to the reotor, in conformity with the 6th of George IL; and the churchw;ardens had received, under the same statute, certain mortuary fees for burials, vaults, asd monuments in the church and churchyard, which fees always greatly exceeded the onnual sum of 120f. paid c the rector. The excese, after pnying the rector, was alvaysapletocuhanohr lm hO st osIS^nuaid lft5he general fdundis ogf the 3ar1eh. Vitr ia, cap.85oI, lthecurchySard and( bhurial vaults had beer CloAd and no buridground bad been provided for the pazish under that Act. he0 cvase stated that the churchwardetis had received eerta{n fees to a small amount, under certain cemetery Acts of the 15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 85, and wero day to pay them to the plaintiff; but those fees lwere not suficient o pay the said yearly sum of 1201. to the Plaintiff. The question raised for the opinion of the Court therefore vas, not whether those sims were payable, but w7heter the churchwsrdens, guardians, or vestrymen -were liable to pay the plaintiff the full sum of 1201. a-year. When the 6th of Georgje ILvwas passed ceitiin gifts and donations referred to in the preamble, and consisting of houlses, hnds, and moneys in the funds, were received by the churchwardeas end, overseers of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, in certain proportions in respect of the two parts of the parish. This was called "the Gift Estate Accouut." A proportion of the said gifts was held by tbe churohwardens and overseers of the new parish of St. Luke till: the passing of the 48th of George III., cap. 97, since iwhich tine the said proprtiOa had been received by the trea. eurer of the guardiaas, and applied by them in the same manner as it had been by the churchwardens. Of many of tbose charities, gifts, and donations, amountung to 811., the doners and trusts were unknown; and of many ,t'bers, to a, considerable amount, the trusts were vague or not declazed, and the amounts were distributed under the 76th section of the 48th of George IIL, chap. 97. The whole of the moneys so received by the treasurer in respect of the said charities amounted to about 1,0001. annually. There were also houses and property, belonging to the parish, the rents of which were received by the churc'wardens. The accounts of the guardians and church. wardens were annually submitted to and settled at a meet. ing of the guardians and vestrymen, as directed by the 77th section of the 48th of George IIL, chap. 97. The question was -whether, on the facts stated, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the annual sum of 1201. either from the chutrch. wardens, guardians, treasurer, or vestrymen; and this question tuvned chiefty onthe construction to be put by the Court on the severalsections of the6th of GeorgelL By that statute (page 394) it was enacted that for and towards raising a sun of 1201 to be paid to the rector the churchfwardens should be entitled to receive certain burial fees, and by the succeeding section (page 395) it was enacted that the churchwardens Bhould yearl pay "out of any parish moneys in his or their hands" the sum of 1201 to the rector, and in case such moneys should happen to be deficient for that purpose, then " out of any other public money in his or their hands, belonging to the said parish, not arising by any poor-rate or ground-rate," as the major part of the vestry. men should direct, andwhichother3noneybshouldbereXlacpd out of the next surplus of the burial moneys. In default of payment for 21 days, the next section (page 396) gave the rector a right to sue for the same in an action of debt in one of the superior courts. Several sections of,h Act passed for regulating the poor of St. Luke's (the ik of George m., cap. 97) were also referred to. Mr. HEL EIL, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Bullar), was heard for the plaintiff, and contended that the plaintiffwas entitled to the sum of 1201, and if it could not be paid out of the fund primualy charged it ought to be paid out of those parish funds which were applicable to parochial purposes generally. Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Hollway), on the part of the churchwardens, contended that, as the buril ee fund was gone, out of which the rstor's payment was to be paid, the plaintif could not recover. Lord CAIAELL said he thought that, under the 6th of George LL, the rector was entitled to the sum of 1201., and there was nothing in the subsequent statute to divest him of his title. His Lordship thought that the amount might he paid out of the funds which under the 48th of George iL, were made applicable to the relief of the poor. Mr. -Out of those charities, gifts, and donations the donors and trusts of which were unknown, and of which the trusts were vague or not declared, and which by the 76th section of the 48th of George IM., chap. 97, were mide applicable in aid of the poor-rate? Iord Amps}nELL assented. Mr. Justice WIGnmTsA, Mr. Justice ERna, and Mr. Justice CoOsnoN expressed themselves to the same effect. Judgment for the plaintiff -rVIor V. COOPR, This case came before the Court upon a demurrer to the defendant's plea. The action was for a libel contained in a letter addressed by the defendant to a Mr. Quinn, in which he said the plaintiff had been guilty of "dupicity," and that "there was nothing too base for hiruta be guilty of." The plea of justification set out that the defendant had lentthe t and another person two sums of money on their I 0 U's that the defendant could not get his money repaid, and th4 disputes thence arose - and that the plaintiff called on the defendant and asked bim to show hiinth memorandum and that when the defendant did so the plaintiff "fraudu lently and falsely asserted that the memorandum was not in his handwriting;" and that it was in reference to these ircumstances the defendant wrote the libel complained of, To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and this raised the queesStiiodnhwhlether the circumstances set out in the plea Mr. Unthank appeared in support of the demurrer, and Mr. Addison of the plea. Lord CPBZm said he thought that if a man fraudulently and falsely denied his own handwriting to a memorandum of that sort, " there was nothing too base for him to be guilty of." To say that he would murder his own father would be too much. (Laughter.)

This was an appeal from a decision of the judge of the County Court of Mionmouthshire. The facts stated were that the defendant was a farmer, who for several years had been the owner of a dog. About four years ao th dog bit a girl, eight years of age, on the forehead, whie she was going through the defendant's foal-yard in the day. time. This fact was well known to the defendant, but he allowed the dog to go at large in December last, when it worried the plamtiff's sheep, and killed severaL The judge thought there was evidence to go to the jury, and decided in favour of the plaintiff, vith 37t. 4s. damages. Mr. GRAY now contended that there was no evidence to go the jury. It must be shown that the dog was in the hbit of biting. One such act four Years ago was not sufficient. Mr. Matthews, who appeared for the plaintiff, was not called upon. Lord CAxNBEIu said he thought judgment ought to be given for the plaintiff. According to the law of Scotland, which his Lordship thought in this matter was more reasonable than that of England, it was not necessary to show the funious habit of the animal, or the scentep, It was more reasonable in such a case that the loss should fall upon the owner of the dog than upon the owner of the sheep. But, according to the law of England, it was shown that the dog had a furious bad habit to the knowledge Of the master. It had been held in a ease in Strange, referred to by Mr. Justice Wightman, that it was suicient to allege that the dog was of a ferocious and mnischievous disposition, to the knowledge of the defendant. His Lordship thought there was evidence in this case which would support that allegation; and, though he would not say of the dog, as in the case cited, sus. per co, (let him be hanged), he thought that the dog ought to he more cautiously guarded, and, if again guilty of ferocious violence, that the master ought to he answerable. The other Judges were of the same opinion. Judgment for the plaintiffi BAIL CO-URT. (MSiinva at Nif i Prius, before Mr. Justice COLERIDGE and Common Juries.)

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. WFRMrnq'll MAP 1 This Court to-day sat in the Court of Error, and there was therefore no sitting. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at Gyuiidhal, before Mr. Justice WIIaaAMFs and a Common Jury.) PRID1AUX V. SETH. The CoArt sat at 10 o'clock this morning to dispose of the above cause, which had been speoially fixed for to-day. hlr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Quaia were counEel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr.WalterSmith appeared for the defendant. lhis was an action brought for the purpose of enforcing an award which had been made by Mr. Raymond, a gentleman at the bar in considerable practice both atWestminster and on the Home Circuit. The defendant refused to be bonnd by Mr. Raymond's decision, and his reasons for sach refusal were set forth in one of his pleas to the declaration in the pre4iP action, which was added, by leave of a judgo, to thd leas (denying the awaxd) which had boen previously de=vere . In February, 1856, the now defendant commenced an action against the now plaintiff. This action was, by the consent of both parties, referred to Mr. Raymond, who in due time made his award. In that action a Mr. John Trail, of Hare-cort, Temple, acted as attorney for Smith, and a M. William Bevan, of the Old Jewry, was Prideaux's legal adviser, and the reason alleged by Mr. Smith for not obeying the award was stated in his plea to be that Mr. Trail was falsely and fraudulently informed by a clerk of Mr. Bevan, in whose management the cause of Smith and Prideaux was placed, that Mr. Raymond had never been employed or retained in legal business by, and was not even known to, Mr. Bevan, and that by this misrepresentation Mr. Trail had been induced to agree to refer the said cause to 6r. Raymon d. Mr. BovILL baving opened the case shortly for the plaintiff, Mr. Raymond was examined, and stated that previously to the drawin un, of the order of reference in " Smith v Prideaux' hena never been retained by or had business from Mr. Bevan, but that afterwards he did receive briefs from that gentleman in the matter of certain proceedings taken under the Nuisances Removal Act. Mr. Raymond knew nothing whatever of the agreement between Ar. Trail and Mr. Bevan's clerk, entered into when the arbitrator in "Smith v. Prideaue' was chosen, and the bnainess which was sent to him after the drawing up of the order of geferencoe was sent in iRnorance of the repro. Eentation made by Mr. Bevan's clerk to Mfr.

I iARClES' COURT, FRIDAY. MAY L (Before Sir J. Domsom.) Mr. Charles BuTr Gaitskell was admitted a proctor by virtue of the rescript of his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury.
SBCONDARUES' COUBT, May 1. SmVrR V_ flflWn'D%n JInn n (Before Mr. &condair PoTTlI Thi was a writ of inquiry sent down from one of the superior couzts for the assessment by a jury of the damages to be awarded to the plaintiff in an action brought against'the defendant for havng had criminal conversation with his (plaintiiPs) wife. The damages were lid in the declaration at 3,000O Mr. Wilde, Q.o., and Mr. Holland apeared for the plaintiff The defendant, who had suffered judgment by defalt, vas not represented by counseL It appeared that in 1853 the plaintiff Henry Smith, the son of a gentleman, now deceased, who lived at Bankfleld, near Ulverstone, In Lancashire, was mnarriod to a young lady named Julia Hill, of most respectable parentage, her father living at Tattonxhal1. They were eacch 21 yeas of ago, and the marriage was purely one of affection. On the death of his father the plaintiff, under an authoritv in the will, made an apportionment of 2001. a-year for his wife, and they llved together on the happiest possible terms. They travelled about a good deal, and at Dinan in France they became acquainted with a gentleman named Dutertre whose son, LeopoldDtertre, was the defendant. Young Dutertr and the plaintiff became close personal friends and went out shooting, fishing, yachting, c., together, and the defendant had many opportunities of being in Mr Smith's society. The plaintiff and his wife were at Dmnan in August last year, when he was sum moned to Eingland or. an emergency, and some time after hts wife followed and visited her friends at Torquay, and the same happiness seemed to subsist between them up to December, 106. At the beginning of that month Mrm. Smith was remaining with her sister, wife of the Rev. Mr. Pinhorn, of Weymoutb, during Mr. Smith's absenoe on some family matter at the Iacasbireasaizes, and on the 4th she suddenly left, stating that she was going to her husband at Lverpool In consequence of her not being heard of, her sister sent a telegraphic message to Liverpool, where Mr. Smith then was-" Julia left here on Thursday for Iaverpool; has she arrived ?" The plaintiff upon recoeipt of this started for Weymouth directly, but nothing could be ascertained of what had become of her for some time; but subsequently information was given which led to the discovery that on leaving Wey. mouth she proceeded to Dorchester and thence to Southampton, where she was met by a foroigner, the defendant, who had been watching about the railway two or three days. He arrived at Southampton on the last day of November or the 1st of December, took lodgings at an hotel, and on Mrs. Smith arriving at the station he ran up to the carriage and thrust his hand through the window before the tram stoppo but the motion of the train prevented his shaking her ?y the hand, and when she got out they exchanged idsses and drove off to the hotel where he waslodging. Mrs. Smith had a good deal of luggage with her, as if she had prepared for a long journey, and after remamiing at the hotel some hours they eet out for Folkestone, where she took steamer for Calai, went on to Paris, and they were living together at the present time as man and wife at No. 37, Rue Luxembourg. It was surmised that this elopement was planned-if, indeed, the criminal intimacy did not begin-at Dinan, in August, when the plaintiff had to leave suddenly for EnRland, from the circumstance of the defendant being in waiting at Southampton when Mr Smith arrived. Evidence was given of the happy terms upon which the plaintiff and his wife lived, and of the devoted a ation and kindness he invariably paid her. It was stated that he was studying for the bar. The learned counsel, in conduding his statement of the case, said a good deal of attention had of late more particularly been called to actions of this description with a view to an alteration of the law as to the form of proceedings under such circumstances as had rendered this action imperative; but, whatever objection there might be to the present method of pro. cedure, there was this great and important benefit derivable from it, that any one gulty of the infamy of destroying one man's happiness of life and bringing to ruin and uuter disgrace a virtuous wife to whom that man was fondly devoted for the gratification of his own lust was dragged before the pubhc and held up to the execration of allright. thinking men, which there could be no doubt had a great moral effect in deterring others from pursuing a similsr course of conduct,-those who had means at command, but dreaded publicity. Two letters written by Mr Smith in a most affectionate and endearing strain to her husband, whom she called her "dearest, dearest boy," were put in, in addition to other evidence of her afection for hin before her mind was corrupted by the defendant. The proceedings in the cause were duly served on the defendant n Paris, but he had not taken any notice of them. The learned SECONDArY having shortly summed up, The jury assessed the damages at 3,OCOI.

POLMC.. M3i0ON. OUSE.-Fwicis Join Maybury, -Robert Collins, George Pickering, Seorge Boyce, Denis MI'Carthy, and George Reynolds, charged upon suspicion of having been concerned in stealing the contents of 15 large trunks of hoots and shoes, wrhih had been consigned by Mr. Louis Isenberg, of leadenhall-street, to s firm in MIelboourn e, Were finaIlly examned before theLsn IdiBDAvel. Itmill be reUolleted that at the former examinations evidence was adduced to the effect that in the months of February, March, and June last the trunks containing the property were intrusted to Maybury, who is a carman, for delivery at St. Katherine's Docks. It appeared, however, that as soon as he got them into his posseesion he took them to a court in the Commercial-road, where their con. tents were exchanged for stones, ashes, and other rubbish, and the lidswere nailed down, and it appeared, also;, that in that state they were taken by Maybury -to St. Katherine's Docks and shipped for Melbourne, where the fraud was first discovered. Evidence had been likewise brought forward in the statements of a man named Dismond, who acknowledged-that he had been engaged for a long time past in systematically robbing his late employers, Messrs Moses and Son, of Tower-hill, as well ss concerned in the recent robbery. Mr. Lewis again appeared for the prosecution; Mr. HuImphries for Maybury; and Mr. Sleigh, of the Bar, for Boyee and Pickering. Mfr. Lwis "id he had no evidence to add to that which had been already given, and The LOBD MAYOn stated that having given the strictest attention to the whole of the evidence he had come to the onclusion that he would not be justified under all the cirocunstances in committing for trial any of the prisoners, Wth the exception of Maybury, the carman, to whom the ,ro'y had been intrusted. His Lordship then discharged Pickering, Boyce, M3Carthy, and Reynolds, and sad he was determined to send Maybury to the Central Crimin.i Court for tril upon the charge of stealing the goods, but accepted bail for his appearanco in the sum of 400l-iz.e 2001. in the person of the prisoner himself, and 2001. m the person of the prisoner's father. Maybur sid to his Lordship,-I am not guilty of this char&. The evidence is such as cannot be relied on, and I hope yoU wiLm not to send me to be tried upon such testimony. A boy named Edwards, who haa been frequently tried for pickng pockets, was sentenced to imprisonment and hard abour for sx months for stealing a silk handkerchief frem a gentleman. He immediately blewr his nose in the handkerchief very loudly to show that the property belonged to I him. In his pockets were found three new, clean, nicely[scented handkerchiefs. Hfe ha, it appeare, been notorious for folloing well dressed persona, and has been known to do "a good dasy's work" in an hour. G uWh&LL.-Elzabeth Brett, the wife of a constble in the city polce, was charged with stealing plate and wearing apard, to the value of about 201., the property of Mr. Stanland, solicitor, of 22, Bouverie-street,Fleetstreet Mr. Staniland sid the prisoner had been his housekeeper, and, s she was the wife of a policeman, he had unlimited confidence in her. On Wednesday last, however, she absconded, and then he discovered that she had tak-en everything she could lay her hands upon. All the plate from the cheffonier, of which she kept the key, had been abstracted, and the weaing apprel as well as table and bed linen, had disappeared from the drwers in that part of the house which ws farnished for his own occasional occupation, as his family resided at Thames Ditton. The prisoner was alowed several rooms, coals, candles, and 7s. per week. Mr.Rayman, clerkto r.Stanid, swidhesawtheprisoner leave the house on Wednesday last, about 2 o'clock, and had not seenheraince until she was in cudody. About a couple of hours after she left, the postman brought a letter bearing the arringdon.street postmark, and addressed to her husband, who gave the letter to witnesa In consequence of the information contained in that letter he communicated with Mfr. Staniland, and then proceeded to examine the cheffonuer, drawers, &c., when he found a clearance had been made of everything moveable. In his search he discovered a great many pawn-tickets relating to the missing property, wnich he placed in the hands of Green, the detective officer. Several pawnbrokers asants attended ith properwt uhich had been pledged at their establishments by the prisoner, and on being prodaced the whole of it was identi- fed by Mr. Staniland as his propery. He had not missed any other property. His books and papers had not been touched. Sir J. jusaoVBo expre6sed some sarprise as to atth could have been the prisoner's motive. Green said he had heard that she had a child not belon jng to her hband that she had to provide for. g rhe prisoner, who defied any one to find out how she had Ipent the money, avs then committed for triaL. smcrnogto e-shefr.Eundl I,eth madden and Harriet Lee two well dressed women, ere charged with picking pocctsb at the gallery, 5, Pall-mall eat Pollc.eonstable lMord, A162, said he was on duty at the gallery when the prisoners entered together. e suspected their era nd and watched them. eHe saw the prisoners separate, and then they began inspecting cosely the dresses of several ldes, Thea caght sight of him, and immediately telegraphed to eBad other a1d left the gallery.

As soon as released he began to ill-use her worse than ever, and last night he came to her stall, which was all she had to get food for herself and children with, broke the stall to pieces, and destroyed the stock of fruit. When she got home at night her husband came home drank, took every farthing of money from her, knocked her down, kicked her about the body, and tore ote her hr by hsandfuls, He then finished by turing her out, adrshehad toremain inothe pastge all night. lMr. Ieadley, the chief clerk, inquired if she had anything further to say ? wife-He knocked a tooth out the other night.

MIr. BfcINGIs sent him to hard labour for twvo months, WxsERai~r-EIiza Higgins, a woman about 21 years of age,was finally examined, charged with the wilful murder of her infant, one mnonth old. The prisoner, who made no defence, was fully committed for trial. W OMSHr-sMET.-Emma Ayres, alias Spinks, a welldressed, respectable-looking young woman, was charged with the following strange offence - hlr. Francis Shorter, assistant-clerk to the Hackney Union, detaied the case against the prisoner, and from his statement it appeared that a few weeks ago the prisoner, whose personal appearance disarmed all suspicion, took a ready-fnshed lodging, from which shortly afterthecarpet was missing. She was charged at this court with making away with it, acknowledged she had pledged it. and, it being found to be so, she was summarily convicted and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. In consequence of the incarceration of its mother, it became necesary to do Eomething with the prisoner's ilegitimate child, aunt, the prisoner's sister, could no longer upport it, and, application having been made by her for its admisgion to the workhouse, Mr.EShorter was desired to communicate with the prisoner in gaol, that information might be obtained as to her place of settlement. He therefore made inquiry for Emma Ayres at the prison, and was introduced to a woman who responded to that name, who acknowledged she had been sentenced to three months' imprisonment for the carpet, but she displayed such hesitation, and her account of ber former life and settlement was so inconsistent with what had been previously learnt that a suspicion of something wrong was excited, and, the woman being in consequence subjected to a close questioning, the result of her very unwilling aAnswers was the discovery that while in custody at this court-thiswoman being under a sentence of only seven days for disorderly conduct or some such sight offence-the prisoner AgTes was also locked up in the women's cell, and, the two women getting into friendly conversation, they ultimately agreed, for their mutual convenience, to exchange names and sentences, the one in for a week takiDng the other three months, and vice versi, and to respectively take the benefits and disadvantages of the exchange. It was impossible for the officers. of the gaol to know either woman from the mere commitments, and as no prisoner would generally take a longer term of imprisonment than he or she could hdp, a sufficient guarantee is mostly obtained against false personation; both women therefore -when they answered to the commitments were received for wbat they appeared to be, and at the end of the seven days for which the other woman. Matthews, was sentenced, Ayres, who had passed by that name, was discharged in due form, while Matthews willingly remained to complete the three mouths of Ayres. On asking her her motive for voluntarily inflicting upon herself such a Iong term of needless punishment, it turned out that she was a wooman in distressed circumstances, with far from a comfortable home, and beiDg far advanced in the family-way, with no prospect of being properly attended to in het confinement, she Was glad to make this arrangement with the prisoner, to inure those medical and other comforts so indispenuable at such a critical time. Search was then made for the prisoner, but nothing could be heard or seen of her till the preceding evening, when she was accidentally met and given into custody. The prisoner, who smiled and seemed to regard the affi£r as a mere clever device on her part, had nothing to say, and was recommitted to prison for the remainder of her term, but at the same time Ws warned thatthe offence nowroved against her was an indictable one, and that she would most probablyb e made to regard it in a differentlighthereaer.

The male prisoner said, "Send me to the Old Bailey, I shall have a fair tria there." Mr. CoMBII told him that he wotld be tried at the proper court-that is, the Surrey Sessions. Tte woman said, she had nothing to do with ihe robbey, but she did not mind serving four years. which was all they could give her.. They were then faully committed for tril it the next Surrey Sessions. Benjamin Simpson 24, of 317, WilloWvWalk, Bermondser, lerk, and John Gardner, of the samo addres, merchant, wereeecharged with obtainig by fials Pretences a lare M. Solomon, for the prosecntionsad, thatthe charge he had to prefer against the prisonerswas, one of a seriors nature, and of importnce to the mercatile public. The prisoners,he w instructed to say, had for some time carried on businese at 134, Tooley-strt, and 1i, Bermondley-street, as general merchants, under the name of Podmore and Co., and he understood that they had success fully obtined goods of nearly every description from traesmen in a1 parts of the metropolis and the country. Mr. Coblu asked him wihether he had any evidence of fraud committed in London? MIr. Solomon replied that he had not at preaent, but he had Mfr. BeilTy present to prove his chare. A solicitor wiho attended for the prisoners said, It was reguar trade trnsaction betwreen the paries and Mr Bell had received a bill of oxchange for the amount of his Mr. Solomon said, that the bill of exchange was vaTleTles and showed tho system of fraud The bill wa as follows*- 'Threemm,thI after date (JanuarrL 1.15T p'ooarcdertbeso Of ms hundred and elevn e poumas fteeu b i-IL Podmore [It is accepted bz Thoms Tanner, jun., Long-room, Cts. tom-houae.] when the bill was prezented at the London Joint-Stock Bank in Princes.street it was returned "no account,' therefore nis worship would see that It was ultterly valueless, and, under those circumtances, there was the false pretenoe. Inspector mackintosh here informed the maistrate that on entering the prisoners premises they found a quantity of "dummies n pxper, which cOnsisted of straw and sawdust. Thero were only thre chairs which belonged to the prosecutor, anda clock. At their house, 117, Willow-wslk, legea nt Hanom found a quantity of newfurnituren which could not be accounted for. The prisoners' solidtor here ued upon his worship their immediate dischage from custody, as there was no-tin to detain them there. Inspector Mackintosh said, that he was certain that if tbeywere remaanded forafewr days he should be ableto find several cases Against them in the metropolis Mr. Solomon ao asked for a remand, as he was In. structed to say a ver extesive system of fraud had been comttedby them. MEr. COsrn said, there was no evidence at prosent before him to detain them in that conrt. If any offence had been com-itted it was at Manchester, and the proecctor might do as he pleased. 3The prisoners then left the dock, when they were detained by Inspector Mckintosh for the purpose of being onveyed to Manchester. r" LABET.-For some days paSt complaints have been made both to Mr. Elliott and the Hon. G. C. Norbon, by ratepayers in the Parish of LAmbeth, of what they oon¢eive to be an improper, if not an illegal exaction by the oollectors; andesterday M Harriet Kerns, of 47, Paradisestreet, atte ed before the latter magistrate to complain against Mr. Squires, a rate coUlector, and to take his worsilp's adnvie as to how she should proceed in the matter. The applicant stated that she owed a sum of IZ. &a. lOd for highway and poor-rate, and had called on Mr. Squires and ofrered him that amount, together with a sum of 2s for two summons, and 4d. for service, whicht made 1L lls. 2d., but Mr. Squires refused to receive it unless 2s. in addition were paid for warrants. This last sum she refused to pay, because she considered it uniust, from the fact of the names of at least a dozen other ratepayers, as well as that of her husband, appearingin the same warrant, and from hearing tthatt ah r - persons would have to pay also 2g. each so that the collector or the uMO hvrrant would receive no less than 24s., and she wished to know how ahe should act. Iockyear, one of the summoning officers, said, the complainant on a former day had applied to Mr. Elliott and made a similar complaint, and be was directed by the agistrate to see Mr. ires on the subject. He accordingly called on Mr. Squires, and explained to him the nature of the complaint that had been made in the present instance. Mr. Squires admitted that the statement was right, and said he was justified in charging IL for each summons and warrant, and showed him the warrant upon which he acted, and which contined the names of at least dn ratepayers, Mr. Squires further told him that the magmstrates of this court had nothing whatever to do in the matter, as the proceedings n at h ha n tken before the county justies, and his wrarrants signed by a county magis- hr, NORTU obseorved that the practice of including a dozen or it might be 50 defaulters to a certain time in the same warrant, and charging each defaulter ls. for that warrant, was something newto him, and one which he did not think the county justices, ensa proper representatin to them, would sanction. A large majority of small tradesmen and industrious artisans found a great difficulty inpay. ing their heavy rates and taxes without being burdened with improper fees and expenses, and he hoped that in Lambet?, as well as in -other parishes, the latter impostg would be avoided. It was trae, as the collector had stated, that tho magistrates at this court had no jurisdiction in the matter, but his (Mr. Norton's) advice to Mrm Rerns was, to go to the collector and make a tender tohim of U. lls. d., and, .if he reused it to calltn ti.o Young, the county maglatrat,.who, he understood, ;signed the warrant, and make afull sttement of the fact to that The applicant thaned his worship for Ahis kind attention, and sadse should act on his suggestion.

M BTAY AND iAVdL IrNTELUrX N We have renen to beueve that Vice-Admiral Sir Bar rington Reynold, KO.B., is selected by the Lords of the Admiralty as the successor to Admiral Sir Wlianm Parier, as Commandor-in-Chief atDevonport, whose period of service is about to expire. Rear.Admiral Reynolde, on being promoted to his 9lag, wss appointed. CoumAnder-in-Chief at the Cape of Good Hope, *heorr the galant Admiral was transferred to the STheasb Coast of Amorica. At that time the tlave trade was vigorously carried on, even with teo approbation of the Brazilian Government. The Admrl at once disposed of his squadron in a manner besc i culated to check that abominable traffic, and by Eis keep ing constantly at sea set to those under Mis com-and the best possiblo example. Byhis ceorrespondence with tho Brazilian Government and with the British Minister at Rio Janeiro he had at length the satisfaction of overcoming the prejudices of the authorities nt Rio, who not only abandoned the protecion they had hitherto afforded to the slave trade, but dedared those guity of piracy who should afterwards ongage therein, and offered head money to the officers of the Brazi3ian navy for the capture of daves. The gallant Admiral returned to England in January in 1852, having received the thanks of the Admiralty for his services in the cause of humanity during his command. This gallant officer was promoted to the rank of Vice-Admiral 4th of July, 1853, and in Febru. ary, 1856, he was nominated a Knight-Commander of the Order of the Batb. Yesterday a detachment of invalid troops, consisting of 86 non-commissioned officers and men belonging to various regiments serving in the Mediterranean and China, arrived at Chatham, in charge of Lieutenant F. B. Cole, 7th Fusileers, and Staff Assistant-Surgeon J. L. Hollovay. Tho detachment consisted of troops belonging chiefly to the 15th, 55th, 59th, and 96th Regiments, and were brought home in the Cressy, 81, and the Winchester, 50. They were conveyed to the invalid dep6t to await an inspecton by the Commissioners of Chelsea Hospital. The following ofBicers have joined the depots of their regiments at Chatham Garrison:-Captain D. R. Croasdaile, 61st Regiment; Lieutenant P. B. Lucas, 10th Regiment; and Lieutenant J. M. Madden, 70th Regiment. An order has just been Issued by the authorities at the Horse Guards, whereby the whole of the troops now serving in ths army wvho were enlisted for 10 years, and who have completed seven years' service and upwards, with good characters, will be allowed to re-enlist, receiving a bounty of 31., 2f. of which will be paid in cash and the other in necessaries. Should, however, the latter be not required, the whole sum will be handed to the soldier re-enlisting. By this arrangement there will be a saving effected on each recruit of about 31., according to the present scale allowed for each recruit to the sub-division officer and recruiting parties. Her Majesty's screw steamship Hesper, laden with stores for China, left Woolwich dockyard on Thursday for Greenhithe. Tho steam storeship Rhadamanthus was yesterday removed from King William-dock, Woolwich, and was rePlaced by Her Majesty's pad dlewheel steamer Spitfire. The hired transport Agamemnon went down to Woolwioh yesterday to commence shipping war stores for China. The now steam yacht built for the Emperor of Japan sailed from Plymouth on Thursday. The crew of the Cambridge, 78, gunnery ship, Captain A. Jerningham, were paid wages yesterday. The Banterer, Clown, Firm, and Kestrel gunboats went from Iamoaze on Wednesday, into Plymouth Sound, where 16 of them were at anchor yesterday morning. The Belleisle, Commander Rodd, fitting as a hospital ship for China, was taken out of dock at Devonport on Thursday, and placed in the floating basin. The paddlewheel steamship Leopard, 16, is ordered to be commissioned at Plymouth for Captain James F. B. Wainwright. The crew of the Boscawen, 70, Captain W. F. Glanville, were paid off at Devonport on Thursday, preparatory to her being recommissioned as flagship for the Cape of Good Hope station. The steamship Imperial, with wine and fruit from Oporto, for London, which put into Plymouth on Friday morning, reports having passed on Thursday, 44 miles south. west of the Lizard, the ship Admiral, outward-bound with troops. The C and I troops of Royal Horse Arbtillery, under the command of Colonel Strange and Major Brandling, were yesterday morning exercised in the Arsenal marshes, Woolwicb, and practised a series of firing in the long range. A continuation of mortar practice was likewise carried out on Woolwich common by the junior officers of the Royal Artillery, at the usual butt, a flagstaff, on the commou. Fourteen 10-inch shells were fired over a range of 700 yards, and fell within a well-direoted distance of the aim. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty : Lieutenant John F. Leeson, to the Cornwallis; John Scott and William Mayos, masters, to the Cyclops; the Rev. F. W. Smith, chaplain and naval instructor, to the Leopard; Hart Gimlett, surgeon, to the Cyclops; W. D. Kerr, surgeon, to the Agamemnon; James J. Martin, surgeon, to the Leopard; B. R. Murphy, assistant-surgeon, to the Leopard; P. W. Rolston, assistant-surgeon, to the Agamemnon; (1. W. J.

TIHE BOMBARDMENT OF CANTON. TO THE EDITORt OF THE TIMIES. Sir,-During the late debates on the China question no argument in opposition to the course adopted by our authorities was found more effectual, or used more freely, than that contained in eloquent and pathetic descriptions of the destruction of life caused by the wanton bombardment of the most populous city of the East, and the murder of thousands and tens of thousands of innocent men, women, and children entailed by that unheard-of act of barbarity, in revenge for, at the most, a trivial insult. It so happens that I have received by the mail that has just arrived a private letter from Hongkong, dated March 6, and written by a person in every wvay qualified to speak on the subject, in which this very point is alluded to. I subjoin a short extract for the information of your readers, merely premising that the date of the letter proves that it is not " got up" in reply to the charges in question, as the report of the debates would not reach China till nearly two months afterwards:- bThe loss of life at Canton has been very small, the Admiral having also spared the people. The Chinese say that only 23 persons were kIlled within the city by the bombardment. This is probably too small a number, but the Americans kiUed a far greater number than the English in their attacks, with reference to the forces engaged." On how rotten a foundation has a vast superstructure of declamation and invective been raised! I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant. A IERCHANT. London, May 1.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I must once more beg a small space in your column3 in ordor to acquaint Mr. Allan that I am quite informed as to his invention. It is true I do not know the exact size he proposes to make his cable, but lsuppose be intends to make it sufficiently heavy to sink. If he does this, and makes it large enough to give moderate strength, he must use somO kind of break to prevent the cable running out too fast. If on the contrary, he makes it so slight as to be capable of handlng lke a smallline, I doubt not it will share the saume fate as other slender affairs of the kind, as, for instance, that of the first rope between Dover nud Calais the first also between Holyhead and Kingatowvn and the one laid between Scotland sad Iroland by the Irish Electric Telegraph Company. Neither of thesa remained sound for more than two or three days, and two of them were cut up and appropriated by fisher. men. The Balaklava cable also soon became uEeless from itS slight construction. I do not wish to encumber your columns with a corresponence, neither have I thetime or inclination to enter into a discussion with hIr. Allan as to the merits or demerits of his invention. I musttherefore leave that gentleman to ng the matter practically before the public, if he can. We shall than see if it possesses the advantages he supposes I am, Sir, your obedient servant. W. T. HENLEY. 46, St. Johunstreet.road, Apsi tO.
HORRIBLE DEATH.-An old man named Thomas Smith, who kept a turnpike-gate near Barnstable, Devonshire, came by his death under shooking and mysterious circumnstances a few day6 ago. It appears that a serva- in the employ of Mr. Brown was nding past the turnpike-gate, wvhen he saw the old man with his olothes on fire. instead of dismounting, the servant rode baok to the town, a half-nilo, to get asistanoe.

"'Marquis of flertford's office, Lisburn, April L"' GREAT MUNSTER FIR. This great annual fair commnenced yesterday under favourable auspices, the weather being fine and dry, and the rates sufficiently remunerative to satisfy even the graziers themselves. The sales were confined the first day to pigs and horses. The show of the former far surpassed that of last year. The number exposed for sale exceeded 3,000, and nearly the entire was cleared off the green at an early hour. One man sold four heavy pigs for 421., and the general average for bacon swine was set down at from 52s. to 56s. per cwt. The display of horses was also excellent, but business was rather dull, and there were no buyers for the army. Hunters brought freely from 1001. to 1501., but a great many remained unsold. The black cattle and sheep fair commences to-morrow. EFFECTS OF THE LATE RAINS. One of the Mayo papers, alluding to the unfavourable weather of the last month, says *- " Were it not for the exertions made by farmers to handfecd to a certain extent their herds and flocks, we might by this time be chronicling the deaths of stock in such numbers as, if continued, would soon bring us to the end of them. As it is, and notwithstanding these exertions, prosecuted under so many dif'iculties consequent on the scarcity and high prices of fodder, cattle, particularly the weaker and younger descriptions, have been and are dying in large numbers and in every direction, particularly so in exposed places and in the mountain districts, where it is at once dif'icult to shelter and to feed them. The poor people are, of course, the most serious sufferers in this way. Not that competent famers hav'nt lost. We know that they have, and to a large extent. But the poor man is de facto the sufferer. He sends his one or two calves, or whatever they may be, to be grazed on a mountain farm. These have been purchased with the savings, it is likely, of reas of labour. They are his enti roperty, with which he hopes to be able to pay the rent Or the land or house he occupies, and perhaps be the means of ultimately improving his circumstances. The rains have desconded vith a terrible and destructive abundance at a time when. least expected, and when no preparations were made for it. The very sprouting grass is injured fiom excess of moisture. The cattle ae unable, unsheltered and unfed, to exidure long such inclbmency They are affected with cathartic diseases, become attenuated, and I a few days or weeks, if not timely succoured, are dead. All that is left of the hopes of the poor grazier are the hides, for which he obtains a few shillinge each. We know that all this is as we have stated, and without any inquiry at all might be known from the number of hides seen coming daily into town from the country districts during the last few weeks."

THE ROYAL FAMrZY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The remarks which you this day make on the occasioni of the death of the Duchess of Glocester contain two smaall genealoglcal errors. You say- " There were 13 children born from the marriage of George flI with Queen Charlotte." There were in reality 15, the two whon you omit being Prince Octanu~s and Prince Alfred, who both died in child- You further say- " It is singular, however, how few in number are the representatives of this numerous family in the present generation. Queen Victoria, the King of Eanover, and the three children of the late Duke of Cambridge are, we believe, now tie onlysurvivors, and the Princess Charlotte, daughter of George IV., is the only one who haspassed away." Not the only one, for two others have passed awaythe two children of the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV. His daughter Charlotte lived a few hours, having been born and died on the 27th of March, 1819. His secondt daughter, Elizabeth, was born oathe 10th of December, 1820, and diedon the 4th of March, 1821. I aml, Sir, your obedient servant. IL _1., J.
DAnnha BunoGLAuy.-One of the most daring and violent3 burglaries perpetrated for some time past in this neighbourhood was oommitted on Wednesday night, or rather early on Thursday morning, at theVicara=e, 'ardley. About 2 o'clock the Rev. Mr. Gwyther was awaiened by a loud noise, subsequently ascertained to have been caused by the bursting open of the ball door. The burglars were shortly afterwards heard ascending the stairs, and on reaclhing the landing proceeded immediately to the rev. gentleman's bedroom door. Mr. and Mrs. Gwytherrushed to the door of their apartment, in hopes of preventing the entrance on the rumfians. All tho resistance they were able to offer was entirely unavailing. The burglars broke open the door by furious kliks, and two of their nuniber entered the room, the one armed with an iron bar, with which he strck Mr. Gwyther across the neck, fortu. nately without in9icting any serious inuiy, and the other with a pistol, which he presented at that gentleman's head. Both the ruffians uttered the moet outrageous threats, one of-them In particular caling upon his comrade to beat bis brains out. A third burglar below stairs now called to his a88Ociates, inquiring if " more should come up," to which, endently condent in their ability to overpower any resistance, the robbers replied " No, we are enough for them." Mr. Gwyther entreated his assailants to spere his life, and they should have allhe could give them. They at length desisted from their violence, having extorted from himh a promise not to proswute them. Mr. Gwyther then delivered up to them two valuable watches, some jewelry, and other property to the value of 304 They next demand the contunion plate, but, on being told that it was not in the house, departed after some furthersearching. Mrs. Gwyther then proceeded to call up her brother and the servant man, who slept in the back part of the house, and had not been disturbed by the noiso made by the burglars. They were, however, too late in appearing on the scene to render any assistance, and the rufmans effected their retreat without molestation, carrying with them their iligotten plunder. Mr. Gwyther is unable to give any description of the thieves, excepting that one of them was taller than the other, and dressed in fustian clothes, while his companion wore dark ones. Their faces were disguised by crape masks. To show the evident deliberation and coolness with which the robbers acted it may be mentioned that it was discovered upon examination of the premises that the baek door had been fastened by them on the outside, thus preventing the egress of any of the inmates to give an alarm. A bell had also been carried out of the house aun placed in an arbour in the garden, lest any one should ring it. A short ladder was also found in the garden, which had, no doubt, been brought to facilitate entrance through-the bedroom, windows, had the fastenings of the door been too strong for the thieves easily to force. On the day preceding the outrage a tall man, somewhat re.%mbling one of thelurglars, called at the vicarage and wnade some irivoloems inquiries about glazing the front of the chu.-ch dock. Several footmarks were traceable across the gardeWi- but not sufficiently defined to indicate the preciso strength of the gang. The occurrenco has excited no smanl] conaternatlon in the vioiaity. We trust, should the perpetrators of the outrage be isUcovered, Mxr. Gwyther will not consider his extorted pwzmiso so hinding as to yrevent his giving that evidence vwhich piay lead to the inleCtiog upon them 6t she punishmenft ihe7. ieslerv,e,Brzv1 gfrcul. :
A BREST of BAYGL;-SHMEN mi the COITTINBNT. ? (FJtOi A COBRESPONDRN-T I A few weeks since the foreign iesidents in Paris were shocked by the tragical death of an American gentleman of unquestionable respectability, who, being- confined in the debtors' prison in the Rue de Clichy, had been chot dead by a sentry for remaining at a particular window of the prison after having been ordered to withdrai. The incideat led, at the time of its occurrence, to wa universal outburst, in condemnatlou.not merely of the strictness of disciplino which could visit with instant death an offence-or, possibly, a mere misapprehension-so trivial, but of the whole system, under which all foreigners resident in France are subject to arrest for debt, or rather for alleged debt, or for an alleged offence of any kind. For, in trith, any Frenchman (however unworthy ot credence) may; or his own allegation, cause the arrest of a foreigner with. out commencing any suit, and without even making an affidavit of debt, all that is requisite being a simplo declaration (not upon oath, and involving none of tho penal. ties of perjury, if fase) that the foreigner in question owes the claimantasum which must not be less than 100f,-or about 41. sterling. Nor is this all. It is notlinerely tb;e fact of arrest being possible which requires an instant rermedy, but the naturo of the imprisonment to which its unfortunate: victims are subjected; they being, in fact, treated much more lik-e felons than like persons provisionally detained, -and the same species of treatment by the way, being also extended to persons arrested onmere accusation of some orany offence orrraud. Aprisonerthusconfinedis allowed toseehis friends on but four days in each week, and even then only between the hours of 10 and 4. In his place of confinement, which is rather a cell than an apartment, he has no actual privacy during the day (the door having no fastening except on the outer aide), and is locked into it in absolute solitude from 8 o'clock in the evening until 7 in the morn ing. In Austri, in Prussia, in Belgium, and even in the Swism Cantons, all the worst featurcs of the French system exist in an exaggerated form. Bills held by English moneylenders or obtained by the most unworthy means have only to be sent to some Prussian or Swiss banker or lawyer, and the luckless acceptor or endorser, who is devoting the prescribed "six weeks" to the traditional "continental tour," finds himself aprisoner,withnohope ofspeedyrelease, except by payment of a demand which, in many cases, is such asno claimant would ever have dared even to asserb in an English court of law. In 1852 a notorious money-lender learned through the treachery of a third person that a young gentleman who was travelling on the Continent would pass through Brussels on e. certain day, and had directed a remittance to be ad. dressed to him at the poste-restanto in that town. .Althou3h the young gentleman in question had never visted Brussels before, and was entirely unknown there, a bill of his, more than a year overdue, was alleged to have been discounted by a banker in Brussels, and on present. ing himself at the poste-restante he was arrested and conducted to prison. He speedily ascertained tho trae nature of the claim, and applied for the arrest to be annuUed; but, by a succession of technical manceuvres, nearly three months were consumed before the application came up for decision. The prisoner, however, was confident of succes3. The case was called. All the parties answered bat one. One of the advocates was absent, and on the application of a brother gownsman, who stated that the absentee "had gone into the country on a shooting excarsion," the hearing of the case was actually adjourned for a month! At this stage of affairs the creditors began to throw out hints of compromise. The prisoner was told that another adjournment was perfectly possible, and that even if he should gain his cause the creditors would appeal, and prolong the contest for several months, so that, whetheo he owcd the money or not, he had better settle the affair and obtain his freedom. Repugnant as was this advice to his sense of his own rights, he yielded to the force of circumstances and acted upon it. VWhere such an abuse is so easily made available it need hardly be said that the arrest of a foreigner is of frequent occurrence, and numerous instances might be cited whera Englishmen of the highest respectability have paid tha penalty of disputing the extortionate demands of tradesmen or hotel-keepers, by undergoing the wrong and ignominy of an 1 rest for debt and have been glad, perhaps after two or three days'imprisonment, to pay the unrighteous demand, rather than await in prison the tardy and uncertain relief of the law. The same is true of* Paris and of many of the French towns, although proportionately in a lesser degree. In both France and Belgium the system of arrest for alleged crimes or offences is also most oppressive in its application to foreigners, and in Belgium especially is susceptible of abuse to an extent almost incredible. There is stiU to be found in our bookshops A Karratime of the Arrest of an Engtishman in France, written by Dr. (now Sir John) Bowring, to expose the infamous manner in which he himself had been arrested on some abhurd accusation, and the treatment to which he had been subjected during the considerable time which elapsed before he could obtain his release. And, in reference to Belgium, little more than a year has elapsed since a case of arrest occurred there, which produced a foeling not likely to subside until such a change is effected as will permit Englishmen to reside or travel in Belgium without being exposed, upon the most groundless or frivolous prO. text, to an imprisonment worthy in kind of nothing less than that Inquisition of which one would almost fancy thati the traditions had been preserved in Brussds ever since the days of the Spanish rule. An English gentleman, holding a high position in connexion with one of the most important railway undertakings in Belgium, was accused of having "given away shares" to persons of influence or official rank in that country; and, although the fact itself rested upon mer assertion, and, if proved, was not shown to involve the commission of any criminal or even illegal act, this gentleman was arrested at the frontier on entering Belgium after a temporary absenco (and in spite of a formal ssaurance from the authorities that he might come and go in perfect safety), his luggage seized, his papers and person searched, aud himself transported to a criminal prison in Brussels, without being allowed to communicate with any friend, or even to acquaint his wife and family with what had occurred, or allay their anxiety by stating the causo of his sadden disappearance. For 16 days was this gentleman kept in solitary confinement, and rigidly au secret-i e., precluded from communication with any human being, except the magistrate, wh occasionally came to interrogate him, and forbidden either to see a lavwyer, or to have a professional adviser, or evea a witness, present on his behalf during these interroga. tories. Not until the expiration of those 16 days was the prisoner allowed to communicate with counsel or friends; and even after their expiration, and after the charges against him had been ignored by two successive tribunals, similar in character to our grand jury, he was still d- tained in prison, and his release on bail refused, although bail was repeatedly offered to any amount. Nor could he, by any effort or entreaty, obtain a trial or public hearing unitl he had lain in prison, subjected to treatment little better than that accorded to a convict, for 19 weeks; or nearly five months ! The trial which he at lengb obtained resulted in an acquittaZ; but even then his release was delayed for 20 days, nor was he finally set at liberty exoept on bail, and after the public prosecutor had appealed from this acquittal, in order to retain the prisoner sub judice and disable him from bringing an action for false imprisonment; for it must be Imown that in Belgium the public prosecutor can not only appeal against an acquit_ tal which in England is final, but is allowed threc yars in vhichto proseutet hat appeal, during the whole of which time the unhappy defendant rests under the baP of 'the. pending accusation. All this is bad enough, but, in so far as arrest for debt is concerned, its worst characteristics are surpassed by-the state of things which exists in Prussia in reference to foreigners. Any Prussian subject possesses the same right of causing the arrest of any foreigner on the m'ere allegation of the smallest debt as is enjoyed by a French. man or Belgian, with an additional power of seizing every description of property belonging to the debtor or his family, not excepting even necessary wearing apparel, unless actually upon the person. Besides this, a married woman may be arrested and imprisoned in the temporary absence of her husband, and for debts contracted by him; and any youth above 16 years of age may in like manner, in their absence, be arrested for debts contracted by his father or mother ' In 1851 an Englishwoman was thus arrested at Bonn in the absence of her husband, and imprisoned until the rew ditors were paid; and within the last week Belgium has claimed equality in the discredit of such proceedings, by an attempt to arrest two young ladies for the debt of a deceased parent; and it was only by virtue of a friendly warning tha-, these poor girls succeeded in making their escape. They ar; at this moment in London. On or about the 20th of January, 1853, an Englishman named L-, who had been for a year or more resident inI the environs of Bonn, fell into arreai with his landlord to the extent of about 601., from the failure of remittances, which had previously arrived with regularity. He was suddenly, arrested in his bedroom by two ciiil officers, accompanied by two gendarmes, who seized not only upone his person,-but upon all his effects and papers, taking watch and trinkets from his person, and peremptorily refusing to allow him to take with hinI for use in the prison any change of clothing or linen, or even a single article of night-clothing, He Was then placed between the two offi E ;n S4 takeia thrugh the public steets to the P i l guarded by the two gcndamea. On arrival bis money als,, ws taken from him, and he was plaed in a elU ana leoked in by himiself,:witihot fire or light. VMhis was a "proMliiona alrrest" for a debt niot proved I With t}le exception of the lawyer, who could see him in the office and in presence of the director of the prison, no one could we him at all except oi certain days, and then by a written order of the burgomaster, counter. signed by the land-rath, and all communication was held through a grating, in presence of one of the officers of the prison, and limited to 15 minutes on each occasion. His bed was simply and purely a species of rnattreos filled with loos6 straw, placed upon a low stump bedsad, i and furnished with a single flock pillow, and for all bed- clothing (although it was mid-winter) a blanket and a rug;I -the one to lie upon and the other to serve as a coverlng I Only the simplest food was allowed, and at his own charge; while wine and spirits were absolutely prohibited. A statement of the facts was addressed by the English residents to Lord Bloomfield, Her Majesty's Minister at Berlin,who gave it th2 promptest attention, and on thofifth day after writing to his Lordslip a letter was received from him to say that he hadmnade a strong repremsutation of the case of Mr. L to.the properl-department of the Prussian Government. Four dayks elapsed, however; withoiit any cbange-whatever having been made, but whether Any would have been sabsequently effected there were no means of juadging, for Mr. L. received money from England, and obtaned his release. But, as to any permanent resUlt vhich might havo been expected from Lord Bloomfield's interference, it is certain that none was attained; for less than two years afterwards-.e., on the 22d of December, 1854, another Englishman asarresTed in Bonn upon a bill of exchange nearly three years old, which was passed to a banker in Cologne for the express purpose of effecting such arrest, and this gentlemanL was subjected to precisdy the same treatment in every particular as that which had been inflicted upon Mr. L1 Amid all the "protection" which it is the boast of Englisehmen that their Government accords to its own subjects in even the remotest quarters of the world and which it not unfrequently extends to the oppressed of other nations, it is surely not unreasonable to suggest, that some effort should be made to prevent our countrymen from being exposed in nearly every country in Europe, and even in those with which our aliance is closest, to penal imprisonment, which is often in reality inficted by other Englshiien in gross evasion of the local law, and is in all cases a monstrous violation of the broad principle which, among All civilized nations, insures to foreigners, the subjects of friendly Powers, equal protection for person and property to that which is enjoyed by natives aud subjects of each country Itzelf.
Ci1r ORTHOP&DIc H1osPITzI.-The sixth annual festival of this excellent charitable institution was celebrated last evening at the London Tavern, Bishopsvate. street.

Afterthe cloth was removed " The HEcalth of Her Majesty" was proposed bythe noble Duke, and was drunk in the usual loyal spirit of enthusiasm. The other constitutional toasts having been given and duly responded to, the noble chairman propoFed the bealths of the " Prince of Scinde" and of "Hls Highness the Nawab of Surat," fUr which the Moonshee of their Highncsses returned thanks. He assured his Grace and the company present Itbat, although tbeir Highneass were not able to express in language their acknowledgments for the honour done them, yet they felt deeply the coempliment that had been paid to them. Much as they admired the institutions of this great and free country, and deeply impressed aS they werewith the wealth and splendour that everywhere abounded, still Do circumstance so forcibly interested their feelngs as that spirit of charity which was so conspicuously displayed by the people of this country in every department and class of social life. (Cheers.) The report, which was read by the Rev, R. N. Brown, the hon. recretary, set forth that the patieats admitted to treatment during thu past year exceeded by 101 the number of tbepreceding year. T}e object of the institution was ta afford gratmtous rgpcal treatment to persons of every nation suffering under club-foot contractions, or distortions of the limbs, curvatures of the spine, or other bodily Ideformities.

IRisH CuRcH ThLssro.-s.-This societr held it e2ghth anniversary yesterday in Exeter-hall under tho presidency of the Earl of Cavan, who, in opening the proceedings, congratulated the meeting on the successful labours of the society, and commended its agency to their benevolent support. The annual report stated that the society's missionary aggression was no longer ignored by the Catholic authorities in Ireland who had now established a formidable organization to check its progress and even to make a counter-aggression upon unguarded Protestantism. The total receipts for the year were 32,9S9L, being 3,7461. less than last year; but it was stated that the "ordinary" income of last year was only 29,4.35W, while the '"ordinary " income of the present year was 31,218 ; thus exhibiting an increase instead of a decrease in the amount received from sources said to constitute the staple of the society's income. The receipts from Ireland were 5761. more that in the preceding year. The missionary operations of the society had been materialy reduced, several missions having been, for reasons which were specified, entirely withdrawn, while othera had been strengthened. The agency at the end of 1856 comprised 45 ordained missionaries, 215 lay agents and Scripture readers, 63 schoolmasters, 73 schoolmistresses, z21ocal commnittee agents, and 274 Irish teachers. lIp tothis period the society had distributed in all 63,000 Bibles, Test3ments, and portions of Scripture in English and Irish. The report then entered into some details with reference to the society's operations in various districts of Ireland, and concluded by an earnest appeal to Protestant Christians to maintain the missons in a state of efficiency. On the motion of Mr. Hamilton, MLP., seconded by the Rev. Mr. Griffith, the report was adopted; and other resolutions of the usual character were submitted to the meeting and unanimously ap IRDER. m SucS -A woman named Knight, residing near the parish church at Rotherhithe, has murdered her son and oommitted suicide. A day or two ao thc husband lost his senses, and, to prevent his layingviolent hands upon either himself or his family, he was placed under restraint in the aylum, and his wife and child were taken to reside in the house of the uncle, at Rotherhithe. Upon arriving there she seemed to be greatly depressed in mind, and complained bitterly of her state. Her friends, however, cheered her up as well as they were able, and at length considered that she had become reconciled to her fate, and advised her to go to bed with her child. The next morning (Thursday) the uncle got up between 5 and 6 o'clock-his usual 'hour to go to work-when ba retirea to the ward to wash his face, and iu drawiag the water from the tt he was terrified at seeing iis relative, Mrs. Xuight, rise to the top of the water. Not knbwing whetheshe was dead or alive, he gave an immediate alarn and sent for the aid of the police and others. In the course of afew minutes Police-constable No. 247 of the x division attended. as well as some of the neighbours, bho succeeded in pullng the unfortunate woman out of the butt, when they found that life was extinct, and had been so for some time. Inaanother water butt was found the body t.f the infant child. Mr. W. Carter, the coroner for East Surrey, yesterday held an inquest at the Europa Tavern, Rotherhithe. From the evidence adduced it appeared that the unfortunate woman for some time had been predisposed to insanity, and, there being no doubt but that she drowned the child and also herself, the jury returned a verdict that Susannah Knight destroyed the life of her eon, George Frederick Knght, while in a state of insanity.

The value of the goods imported into Montreal duzinS 1856 was 4,036,1741., against 3,093,1451. in 1855, being an mcrerse of 943,0291. The arrivals from sea were 222 vessels, against 197 in 155. In addition to this sa'isfactory statement the most important results have followed from the facilities of winter intercourse with the West. From the close of navigation to April 1 the receipts of flour have been nearly 80, GOO banol, almost the whole of which haszone to supply Eastern demand, and which has sought this channel for the fSrat time. The receipts of ashes during the past winter have reached 7,776 barrels, of which a great proportion was shipped v14 Portland to Great Britain.; and similar results are shown in other products. It is most satisfactory to note the earlier ope:nn of spring trado row practiEcable by the Grand Trnk Railw hih crnsequence, commands the transit of freight forWeter Canada, formerly taken through American channels; and! alEo that Montreal maerchants can now ittiact the trade of i the West with much greater success than in former years, The large imports vid Portland of all dweriptions of n2erchandise show that these advantages are appreciated, and tbat as a winter port for Canada that city cannot fail to attract eonstantly increasing attention, while, a a conseque nce of frequet intercourse vblUable trade has resalted ¢ b~.weriPrtare ad Mnte'
TER.B ZAT-. EXPLQS&OASAT. ZUHDHJZZLL. AD.TOTTRJ.n rri,Two: - Thejurymetab the ul lsheadin,Brampton, on Thur day. purxmt to adjournment. The COoONRz said,-I was in hopes when we last met that by thig time the pit would have boen xo fir restored that a thorough inspectioA could have been made cf it by qunaified men with a view to ascertaining the ceuje of the explosion. It appea, however, tht such ix th, devshtaion caused by the explosion and the subsequent filling of tho pit with water, that a very large quantity of the roof has fallen, rendering it perfectly impossible for Any engineer to report upon it at present. It ig therefore necessary that you should farther adjournM ntl the deis can be cleared out, and the pit put ina-an efficient stste for inspection by two engineers, who, Ipropose, should report upon it to you, andthus give you acientific evidenbe upon the matter, The devastation in the pit, I am informed, is extresue, murpusing aYthing of the kidd which wAs ever seea in any colliery before. I very much regret that you have had occasion to be callod together so often, but on Saturday evening, the 18th instant, when we last met, I gave direc. tions to MIr. Superintendent Green that auth of the bodies as Vere not recognizable, inasmmch as they would naturaUy be in a very bad state after remaining so long in the pit, shoald be intrred As speedily as posible at Darficld church; and I was to have notioe when ono or two bodies which could bo clearly identified had b'een found, that the jauy might be summoned to view them, as I did not wish to trouble the jury to viewa more then one or two bodies well identified. Since then I have written to Sir George Grey on the subject, mad received aveply approving that oourse. Mr. aI Morton, the Government Ispector, said, I have to apply that you will further adjourn the inquiry. From an examination of the wine which I made yesterday, in company with the engineers, I am of opinion that an interval of probably three or four weoeks must be allowed for the pur of clearng awray the falls of roof, restoring the ventilaton, and recovering the dead bodies, before any satisFactory inspction of the mine can be made with a view to ascerta the probable cause or causes of the explosion. I take the present opportunity of adding that the progress hitherto made, although slow, has been satisfactory and safe. Thenmesuesthathavebeen devisedanderriedout have, under the circumstanoes, been singularly successful, and I am &lad to be able to sate that I fully approve them. Sonme conversation ensued as to teo length of adjoum. ment, after which the following evidenc'e was gve with regad to the identity of A boay reoovered onx edneday morning:-, Ann, the widow of the late Willam Morsfieldl of Hemingf eld, miner, said, thAther huabLs ndanthxeeIodgers were among the number who had perished in the pit. One of the lodgers was William Moore, aged 23 years. She had that morning insPected a body wbhich wa lying in the reception shed at Lunfdhill, and believed it to be that of 'W. Moore, who had lodpd at her house for upwards of five weeks She could identify it by the boots, stocliUnen trousers, and by there being a cord tied round the boy. The boots had boeen left at her house by a former lodger who owed her money, and she gave them to Moore. They wero "navvie" boots,with very short toe bits, one of them having a Eml cc ppel," (bit of leather put on to repair it) under the lace-bole. His stockings were of a purple colour and knitted. The trousers were of hstian and had a pocket for a rule, and there wsz sa piece of cord round the body. Peter Filder, of Wombwell, miner, said, yesterday (Wednesday) morning, Mr. Maddison sent mo Into tho low south level, near the fae where I found the body which is identified as that of w. Aioore floating in the water. I placed the body in a coffin, brought it out of the pit, and delivered it into the care of a policeran. Thomas lletrich, Eergeant of police, deposed to receiving the body and having it conveyed to the reception shed. At this stage the jur went to the reception shedto view the body, which thby tound in a state of advanced decomposition, and beyond the power of recognition except from the clothes and boots. At the shed they found Robert Moore, who stated that he was a labourer from Leicester. He believed the body to be that of his son, who lefthis house at leicester some time ago. Thestockingshe believod to be those of sis son, but would not swear to them. Ann Horsfiltd recalled.-Deceased's boots wero too large, and he was, in consquence, in the habit of wearing rags round his toes, but I cannot swear that ho wrapped any round on the morning of the exPilosion. Iam positive that the boots taken from deceased's feet are those of W. Moore. [he boots were examined and found to contain a quantity of rags at the toes.] The jury now returced to the inn, after which Mr. Michael Thomas Sadler, jun, of arnsey, surgeon, was called, and said,-Ihave examined the bodiesof two men now lying in the shed. They have died from the effects of the cxplosion, but whether from being burnt or from suffocation it is impossible to say in their advanced stte of decomposition. The second too on tho left foot of the body recovered this morning, and said to be that of a man named Tunncrcliffe, I found to be considerably bent. From the formnof the bones and the articular surfac, I believe that this existed long before death. William Corbridge (one of the deputies) denosed that the deceased, William Moore, trammed for Em lorsfield, and worked in a bank on the south side of the fifth south boardgate. Saw him at the bottom of tho sbaft about 9 o'clock on the morning of the explosion. His body was found at the far end of the south level, which is About 90 yards from his workplae. He had probably attempted to escapo after the explosion, and got neariy to the plae v here his body was found; or the body may have floated thero from the banlc This concluded the evidenc. The Foreman (Mr. J. Johnson) expressed a hopo that tho jury would not be called upon to view any more bodies. The Coroner..-Tha depends upon whether you are satisfied with the identity of those you have already The Foreman.-We are quite satisfied with regard to the Identity of the body of Gray, viewed on the 18th inst, andthat of Moorm. Tho Coroner.-Then it will not bo necessary that you should view any more. The Poreman.-ThO jury wish me to sk whether you cannot do something for them in the wxy of getting their expenses allowed. We think that as we give our time we ought to have our expenses reimbursed. The Coroner.-I would most willingly pay your expenses if I hxd the power. I have now been coroner for 27 or 23 years. Formerly expenscs were allowed to the parishes in resrect of inquests, and they sometimes incurred greater expenses than were proper. In consequence Lord Wharncliffe brought forward a motion at tho quarter sessions at Pontefract to discontinue Allowances to coroner's juries in the West Riding. The application was made at the insance of a number of retepayers, and the matter was fully discussed. It was mentioned that jurymen called upon to act at the assizes had to trarel all the way to York- and had no expenses allowed, and it was thought proper that coroner's jurors should be put upon the same footing. Mr. W. Tohnson.-But this is not an ordinary case. The Foreman.-I think if an application had been mado to tht magistrates at quarter vessions they would have granted us expenses. The Coroner-If you wil mako any recommendation to me, I sh6ll have pleasure in laying it before the magistrates. The Foresnan.-We are quite willing to give our tine, but in so protracted and important an inquiry wro think that our expenses ought to be allowed, We therefore hopo you w;ill bring the matter before the magistrates. The Coroner.-I wil do all I can in the matter. Ir. Morton thinks we had better not adsjourn for moro than three weeks. Mr. Morton.-We hope the pit may be in a state to be examined within the three weeks, although we cannoS speak positively. Thejury then adjourned for three weeks-namely, to Thursday, the 21st of May. FRIDAY ArRNOON. The great exertions of the men specially engaged in recovering the bodices have been attended with considerable success during the week, considering the many and great obstacles they'have had to eneounter. In addition to the 14 bodies recovered up to Thursday afternoon, seven more have been recovered up to this day, Friday. With two exceptions, they were in such a state as to allow of identification. On Thursday, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, two bodies were brought up, one of which was Identified as that of John Dawson. Between 8 and 9 o'clock the same night two more bolies were found, which were recognized as those of Elijah and Beniamin Beevors, brothers. The two latter were found in the fifth board on the south side. From the position in which they were found there is every reason to believe that death mast have been almost instantaneous One of them was found sittingd-own as if he bad been in the act of eating his dinner when the explosion took place. The otherbad one arm raised n4 Placed before his eYem as if suddenly raised to grotect them from the force-of the blast. ThiS morning the shift descending at 12 o'clock on Thursday night before leaving the pit came upon three more bodies. On their removal to tho receiving-shed all of them were recognized. Two of them were found to be Barnett and George Bailey, father and son; the other was named Stephen pledge. All the bodies were quite blaok and very much bmnt. It was expected that more of the bne would be brought out this (Friday) evening, as the -at work have felt a strong smell peculiar to the bodies in theimnmediate vicinity of the pit in which they are now at work. The clearing of the kpit is being rpidly carried forvard, and it is expected that in the course of next week a considerable number of bodies may be recovered. The working parties have been able to proceed along the south level to a considerable distance, but the banks re in such a state of devastation that they will require a good deal of labour be- fore they are in a state to allow of a thorough exploration being made. In the north level great exertions are stiU being made by the men to allow of a passage into the work- ings, but from the quantity of d-rw still remaining, it wilU be a work of some time. Twenty-one bodies have nowv been recovered, hut it is exrpected that three weeks at le..st will elapee before the pit is mn such a state u~ to admit of its being thoroughly ex-
