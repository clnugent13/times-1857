Af ONBY-M.A.RKBTand OITYI.4VTBLLTGL?2VOL?. -400.- Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 5 per mile premium, and the short exchange on London in 25'25 per IZ. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 1Us. l0id. per ounce for standard gold it appears that gold is nearly 2-10ths per cent. dearer in Paris than In London. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 4924 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13 3a per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 5-10ths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London. The course of exchange at New York on Londo:i for bills at 60 days' sight is quoted with a very wide wide range, varying from a trifle above par to 106k per cent., the latter being for first-class paper. When compared with the Mint par between the two countries, this shows the exchange to be considerably against England; and at the highest quotation would admit of gold being sent from England without loss, with a proportionate profit on the lower rates. The fluctuations in the funds to-day have again been most rapid and extensive. The market opened with great weakness at a fall of nearly one and a quarter per cent. from the heavy prices of lastevening, but there was subsequently a considerable reaction, and a more healthful tone became apparent in all departments of business. Consols for money, which left-off yesterday at 87f' to 1, were first quoted 86i. No sales, however, were pressed at that price, and a gradual recovery took place, which was assisted by several purchases on the part of the public. The range was then between 87 and 87* until noon, when the Government broker appeared as a buyer of 10,0001. Exchequer-bills on account of the Sinking Fund. This increased the tendency to confidence, and ultimately, notwith standing an announcement of the Bank of France having adopted a rise of one per cent. in their rate of discount, transactions were effected at 871 to J, and 88 to J for the 10th of November. After regular hours there was less firmness, and the quotations were 87i to i for money and 88 to i for the account. To-morrow is settling day, and the failure of a broker who was involved in the losses which occurred about a month or two back in the Liverpool share-market was announced. Bank Stock left off at 211t to 212i; Reduced, 864 to j-; New Three per Cents., 86g to i; India Stock, 207 to 210; and India Bonds, 30s. to 20s. discount. In Exchequer-bills a transaction occurred during tha morning at 20s. discount, but when the Government broker came in as a buyer the price asked was os. discount. The purchase was made at 8s., and the final quotation was 10s. to 5s. discount, the market being steady on the supposition that the Sinking Fund purchases will continue until the whole of the surplus of 77,7771. in the hands of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt has been invested. In the Stock-Exchanga there was no extraordinary pressure for money, loans from day to day being obtainable at about 6 per cent. In the foreign stock-market the principal feature has consisted of some extraordinary fluctuations in Turkish Six per Cents., which have ranged between 84i and 87, the price at the close showing a recovery of about one per cent. upon the late heavy fall Mexican were negotiated for the account at 19 and a; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 76i; Russian Four-and-a-EHalf per Cents., 97i; Spanish, 40 and i; ditto New Deferred, for the account, 25 and J; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 84k, 861, 85i, 87, 86k, and :§; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 971, 96j, and 97i ; Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 64; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 97. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was a considerable advance in the rate upon Hamburg. Amsterdam and Paris (in the latter case for three months bills) were also quoted higher. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 66f. 70c. for both money and account, showing a fall of an eighth. The great decline in the funds at the opening this morning was caused by the anticipation of a further speedy movement of the rate of discount to 8 per cent. The public, however, did not seem to share the alarm of the dealers, and the course of business graduall4 assumed comparative steadiness. The fact that ev'i at present quotations specie remittances cannot be made from England to the United States at any material profit, supposing the returns to be furnished in the highest class of bills, allayed the fears as to the prospect of any continuous shipments to that country; while, with regard to India, it transpired that some of the orders for sending out silver on the 20th may possibly be countermanded, the advance in the rate of discount here and other considerations rendering the speculatin doubtful. The absence of gold withdrawalsfrom the Bank, an improvement in the foreign exchanges, and the arrival of the Red Jacklet from Melbourne with 264,0001., likewise contributed to the more favourable feeling. The movement adoptel by the Bank of France, so far from having an adverse influence, operated well by lessening the probability of a panic, which could not fail to react on London, being brought about through mismanagement on that side. On the other hand, the announcement of a rather large commercial failure (Messrs. ROss, Mitchell, and Co.) and the apprehension of further similar events in the manufacturing towns prevented any strong reliance that an increase of stringency in the money-market can be avoided. The extent of the applications at the Bank, which were again extraordinary, also operated to check the tendency to recovery, although a large portion of these mav possibly have originated in the desire to provide against the anticipated further advance. On the whole, however, the day may be considered to have passed satisfactorily. To-morrow ,robably a better opportunity will exist for forming a judgmnent a to the future. The dividends then commence, and a large amount of advances wil have to be repaid to the Bank. The Consol settlement will also take place, and four days' later news from New York will perhaps be received at Southampton by the Ariel. The Bank of France have to-day raised their rate of discount to 6q per cent. It had stood at 5i per cent. since the 25th of June, and in the interval there has been a falling off of 2,400,0001. in their stock of bullion, although artifcial purchases at a premium have been continued upon an extensive scale. The measure seems to have been anticipated on the Bourse. At Hamburg the rate of discount has risen to 8 per cent. A statement just circulated that the India-house are m want of more money, and that the Bank have notified to the Government their inability to furnish it, is wholly erroneous. The India Company at this moment would be willing to lend money, the greater part of the recent credit opened at the Bank being unemployed. For future wants they still hold a large reserve of stock and Exchequer-bills, and there is no reason to doubt that the expectation held out of their financial position being such as to enable them to provide for aU wants until the meeting of Parliament will be fully realized. Of course, if the local Government were to announce the necessity of a large sum of specie being sent to Calcutta, an emergency would then be presented which would cal for special action; but it is believed that no such intimation has yet been received, and that in the absence of exceptional circumstauces of this kind there will be nothing to disturb the calculations originally made. The failure was announced this morning of the respectable firm of Messrs. Ross, AMitchell, and Co. They were engaged in the Canadian trade, and have a house in Toronto. Their liabilities are estimated at about 250,0001., while their assets were recently valued at about 350,0001. The disaster is attributed to bills having been returned upon them against which they hold.securities not immediately available, and-hopes are expressed of the practicability of a resumption. The annexed circular was issued this morning by the solicitors to the firm:- "59, Friday-street, Cheapside, Oct. 13. "Wo regret to inform you that Messrs. Ross, Mitchell, and Co., of Gresham-street, in this city, and of Toronto, in Canada, have been compelled, in consequence of the fiare of mercantile housas in this country and in Aterica, to suspend payment. "Mmessrs. Poas, Mitchell, and Co., belie-e their suipmnsion will be but temporary, as their last balance-sheet showed a large surplus; they have, however, at the suggestion of their principal creditors, consented to an investigation of their affairs being made by Mr. Henry Chatteris, of Milk-street, in this city, accountant, who wiu submit the result to the creditors at a general meeting to be coavened for an early day. y .we remain, &a., "REED, LANsGFORD, D )D MARSDEN." The liabilities of the firms whose suspension was announced yesterday at Glasgow are alleged to amount to an aggregate of 1,500,0001., but this is probably an exaggeration. In consequence of the name of M'Donald being common in the north, a request has been made that the specific title should be given of the house of that name which has stopped. It is Messrs. D. and J. M'Donald, sewed muslin manufacturers. Among the other houses mentioned was Patteson and Co. It appears there Ia no such firm. There is one of Godfrey, Pattison, and Co., but in that case there has been no stoppage. The mistake, however, originated in Glasgow, the name of Patteson, or Pattison, having been telegraphed without reserve by persons of great respectability in that city to their London correspondents. Such demand for gold as existed to-day was supplied by the arrival of about 80,000l. from Russia. The mail steamer which left Southampton yesterday for the Cape took out 105,0001. in gold. A contract has been entered into between the Spanish Govermment and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for the conveyance of mails twice a month between Hongkong and Manilla. Under the terms of the contract the service is to commence within six months from the present time; but it is understood the company have made arrangements for carrying on a monthly line between Hongkong and Manilla in the meantime.

ARCIIJEOMOGICAL DISCOVEY.-The recent flood at Filey, says the Yorkshire Gazctte, washed down much of the cliff near the Brigg, and Mr. 'Wilson, painter, of Old Filey, picked up a curious bone among the debris, which he took to Dr. Pritchard, who immediately repaired to the spot where It was found, and high above the place, about 4ft. from the surface, discovered the remains of a Roman wall. On removing some of the stones an earthen vase In good preservation was foumd, with numerous human bones, ornamentedshells, charred wood, and the skuilsof several animaI, probably deer, wolf, and bloodhound. The barrow covers an extent of 100 yards, and as soon as permission is obtained to explore It will no doubt form a most interesting source of curiosities, and reveal the probabilities of this curious point of land being once a Roman station. The property belongs to the Rev, B. Brookes, and the farm is held by Mr. Elisha Elders.

Geelong and Melbourne and Great Western of Canada were also lower. French shares showed increased weakness, but afterwards ralied, and the last prices of Northern of France and Paris and Lyons were fractionaUy higher than the corresponding quotations of yesterday. Pernambuco slightly receded. American descriptions continue to be actively dealt in, and a further reduction occurred in Illinois Central. A fair amount of business has been done in mines; Devon Great Consols closed with more heaviness, and there was an advance in South Wheal Frances. A general fall took place in joint-stock banks.

FRIEI=DLY SOCIETEES.-A small blue-book of 8O pages contains the report of the Registrar of Friendly Bocieties in England. There appears, in l856,to havebeen, in the whole of the United Kingdom, 9,046 depositors in friendly societies, the rmount of whose investments was 1,408,2621., bseig an average of 1551. for each depositor. Including the savings-banks and charitable societies, the number of depositors is raised to 1,341,672, and the amouut of deposits to 34,946,0121, making an average depositof 261. for etch person. There are 560 friendly societies in direct account with the National Debt Commissioners. It; is shown, by comparative tables, that the number of depositors in savings-banks is five times more than the number of persons entitled to dividends on the public debt, and that in savings.banks there were 186,352 depositors, whose average was 5s. each, and that there were 6191,208 depositors (nearly one moiety) whose investments were under 101. each, and that of the numberof persons entitled to dividends 92,205 receivedl under 10. each, 43,287 more than 101., but under 201 and 89,601 more than 201., but under 1001., so that out of 268,995 persons who received dividends 225,093 were under 1001 per annum. In savings-banks the number of depositors whose investments exceeded 2001. was only 1,519, and the number of persons receiving dividends exceeding 40001. per annum only 227.

The BISHOP of OXFORD and the Right Bon. 1Y. B. GLADSTONB on INDIAN AFFAIRS. (From the Liverpool Daily Post of Tuesday.) Yesterday the annual mecting of the Society for the Aid of Foreigp Missions was hold at Chester; and In th3 evening a second meeting, In furtherance of the same object, took place. At both the Lord Bishop of the diocess presided; and the announcement of the expected participancy of the Right Rtev. the Bishop of Oxford and the ight Ron. W. E. Gladstone lent to the occasion an in- ! creased interest. The meeting was held in the Music-hall. The attendance at the midday meeting was large and re. speotable; but in the evening the hall was crowded in all parts to inconvenience. Shortly after 2 o'clook proceedings were commenced. The Lord Bishop, in complimentary terms, welcomed the Bishop of Oxford to his diocess, and thanked his Lordship for his consent to advocate the claims of the Foreign Mlission Society. Some formal business having been disposed of, The Rev. Canon BLOMFIELD proposed the first resolution, which recognized the claimis of the society upoa Christian benevolence. The Lord Bishop of OXFORD, in an eloquent and argu. mentative speech, seconded the resolution, and spoke a' great length on the benefiolal results of missionary labours In all parts of the world. Referring to the Indian :mutinies the Riglht Rev. Prelate said,-If ever there ahowed forth upon the walls before us the fingers nad the handwriting tracing mystic characters to be read by the eye of the prophet of God, surely, surely It is that outbreak. It is hardly now the time for us to venture to speak of it. We feel it so necessary at this moment that the hearts of the n,ation should be as one man united together in order to do that first 'Work that must be done,-I raean the putting down of murder and bloodshed and insubordination by the arm of mightl;-it Is, I say, so essential that the heart of the hation should beat as the heart of one man for the accompHshment of this that It would be unwise of me to turn your attention in another direction; and yet something one must say. We now and again hear it muttered thatIndia costs us a great deal; that it is a sad thing to be associated with a heathen people who can break out into such outrages as these; and we hear, too, the question thrown upon the surface of society and the current of dlscourse, whether it might not be better to give up India altogether. I say, my brethren, I will not enter upon the political matters at stake on such questions; but I say, as a Christian man, we have no right to give up India. (Applause.) God has entrusted it to us that we should hold His peace there; that we should let His gospel have fair play there; that we should try all possible means to convert the people to His truth; and we have no more right, looklug at it as a religious question, to dream for an instant of abandoning our duty now than the constable would have, when men rise up against the law of the land, to say, let us return, and let tbem do their wldl, in ordertoavoidresistance and bloodshed. Our duty is not to give up India, but to hold it. For what? To hold It for Him-to hold it for the benefit of the native races-to hold it that, by our holding It, we may be able to proolaim the name of His Son and the reign of His Spirit, and the evangelization and the regeneration of the races of man. (Applause.) Well, my brethren we can hardly consider these matters without reverting to the fact that we have held India for 100 years, and to the question how, during that period of 100 years, we have discharged the trust ? I have kept you so long already that I cannot now enter into these matters so fully as their lmportance would demand. But, let me say, 100 years ago, after the battle of Plassey, God gave us the command of India, and we took possession of it. Step by step 'we cemented our power over it-we gained victory after victory -many of them in the most dangerous periods of the history of England; and, just think for a moment, when you regard the feeling of anxiety with which the fall of our brave troops is watched, when in every family and house there is suspense for some dear relative or friend-think of how pain'ul the same feelings of anxiety must have been at that period. At that tine, when the great Duke of Welling. ton was conquering at the battle of Aseaye, and when General Lake was gaining those great victories that cemented our power-at that very moment there was at Boulogne an army of Frenchmen, under that wonderful man, the first Napoleon, encamped to invade the very heart of England; and yet through all these mighty difficulties God carried us. And nowv let me ask how we discharged our obligations, I sald so loDg ago as 1841, when I undertook for the first time the work I have undertaken here to-day-that of advocating the cause of foreign missions-I then said what I now repeat, that I believe the history of our administration in India exhibits a series of instances of timidity as to Christian principle which the history of no other people on the face of the earth exhibits. (Applause.) I believe, indeed, we have tried to the hest of our power to do justica to these races; I believe we have endeavoured, wherever we founld oppression and wrvong exercised upon them, to put them down. I believe we have solved a problem whicli no other nation ever did solve, by pre. venting governors enriching themselves at the expense and to the wrong of the people. I believe that in respect of these things we have done much ; I believe Ithat our sccial neglects- I mean in not sufficiently cultivating the land, in not irrigating the land, in not intersecting the country vith railroads-I believe that these were faults, but not faults of intentional commnission. But I must say that I do believe that, as to standing up for the faith of Christ, we have been habitually, consistently, and shamelessly timid. (Applause.) Will it be believed by those who do not know it as a matter of fact that really until 1783 a missionary was not allowed to reside in any part of British India? And when Dr. Carey went out what was he obliged to do? He was obliged to go to Serampore, because it was a Danish settlement, and the Danes were not so timid about the faith of Christ as we were. (Hear.) When Dr. Judson went out from America he was driven out of British India into Burmah, because a Christian British Government would not allow him to remain in British possessions. When thie charter of the East India Company was renewved in 17S3 one whose name it is my blessed privilege to bear (loud applause) stood up in the English Senate for the truth, and he proposed a resolution to this effect, " That India must be, held by the British nation or the moral and religious good of the natives thereof." Now, wbat was done ? The resolution was struck out of the Act before it was allowed to be passed. And, in her highest hall of legislation, England-Christian E1ngland, deliberately and avowedlyrejected from the lips of suchamanthebare general avowal that it was her duty to care for tbe moral and spiritual welfare of her Indian' population. What fillowed? Twenty years later, when the charter was again renewed. he and a band of faithful ones wrung from a reluctant Indian Government the consent that church mis. sionaries should have license to dwell in British India; and they wrung it from them in the face of such assertions, spoken in the House of Commons, that the imorals o' the eldolos'were quite as good !-oh, read them at hlerut, read them at Cawnpore !-were quite as good and as pure as the morals of Christians, and were better fitted for an Oriental people. (llear.) Then came certainiimprovements in our treatmont of India. But, do you remember that Sir Peregrine Maitland was sent homeoin disgracefrom Madras becauise he would not, as Governor, order Christian soldlers to fire salutes of honour before the idol's car ? Because he rofused to give such order he was sent home as a dishonoured man to Christian England. Do you remember the case of the Sepoy in the Bengal army who, converted by God and the loly Ghost to the true faith of Christ, wasnot at the demuand of his fellow-religionists, not at the demand of bis fellow-soldiers, but through the miserable timidity of our own authorities-deprived of his rank and position En his regiment becanse he had become a Christian ? And cran you doubt, when you see what your Sepoy heathen reginients have donie, whethier God is not writing His sentence against the crime of such a dismissal in the blood of their murdered victims ? That noble-minded man dwelt in retirement and privacy for years; and when he was offered other posts he said, "No, you have disgraced me in mv own regiment ; I will go back and serve in that, but I will do nothing else.,,H hel hi ecflrslton until the Burmese war broke out, and, when men vere difficult to be had, lie volunteered to serve again under the Queen's f9ag. And when you read Of these things can you doubt how it must be re,arded in the Courts of Heaven when that edict of deprivation went forth signed by Christian England against a converted Sepoy? Such, then, is the state of things. I for one firmly believe-firmlythat God vill give us one other trial in India. I believe thcrisis of Eng and's greatness-the crisis of her own possessions, of her own Chrirlanity,will depend upon the manner in which she uses tattrust, if again it be commitdtotus. And therefore I say,-I desire every one of you, as Christians and Englishmen, to study this matter over, and to be ready to take a positive attitude of resistance, ir God blesses our arms, to the re-settlement of the Indian quesfton upon anytlng~ but a Christian basis . And let gus npon this point, By a Christian basis God forbid that I should teach you to understand that we should use one iota of force or fraud or earthly favour to draw one man into the profession of the faith of Christ. Our duty seems nerfectly simple. It is, that we sbould maintain in the first place peace, trutb, and quietness,-tbat we should say, no man shall suffer cor religion, be disgraced for religion, or be punished for his religion; but, having declared that, we should declare with just as bold a front, that we are the servants of the Crucified It is our duty, it is our blessing, It is our birthrgbt. We desire to ee converts to our faith, because that fa ith only, will elevate them here and save them hereafter. We are Christian men administering a heathen nation. Wewill not attempt by force or favour to draw a single heathen man over, but we will make no secret of our own Christianity,_our belief that we hold our power on this condition, that we should uFe it for God; and with this responsiblity, that it will be taken from us if we use it for ourselves (Applause.) That seems to be our duty as Christians ; and if every Chris- tian man will fairly assume that attitude the Govemment ^ of England will see the necessity of doizg, and will, I doubt not, gladly do that which you will give it to under- stand it must do, or it must fall, and then, God helping us, i who can forecast the amount of blessedness in store for our church ? Who can say how far she will not be attended by God in coming ages to be at once the minister of truth to the heathen, of purity to our Roman Catholic brethren, givirg the fixedness and firmness of the cburch to those who now lack them, and to be the centre of light and truth, and Christian warmth for an evangelized and grateful world I The resolution was passed, and the meeting closed with prayer. At half-pust 7 in the evening the Music-b all w sagain filled with a respectable and numerous assembly, who were desirous of hearn the cLaims of the society advocated by the Right Hon. w. 13. Gladstone, .P. The Lord Bishop of Chester occupied the chair, and called upon the Rev. F Grosvenor to open the meeting with prayer. The CHAIIt5AN said the claims of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts would be advocated by his rev. friend the Bishop of Oxford, who had already three times addressed the citizens of Cheater. Still as his eloquence was unsurpassed, so it was iniexhaustible' and he would afford to the meeting information which would be interesting and free from monotony. After that gentleman had addrcssed the meetlng the Right Hon. fIr. Gladstone, whose name was sufficient to elicit applause, would set forth the objects of the society, and the mesting would thus be enabled to form a judgment of howv evenly eloquence was balanced between the representatives of the Church and of the State. Mr. Fleming, who had lived as missionary at the Cape of Good Hope, and Mr. Welch, the emigrant chaplain at Liverpool, would take part in the proceedings, and he (the Chairman) vould now caUon the Rev. Mr. Flemingto move the first resolution.l The Rev. B. FLEMSING, late ohaplain to the troops in British Caffratia, said that he felt great pleasure at meet. i ing such an assemblage, not only for himself, but because he felt that the friends then assembled would reap the benefit of such a meeting. The ohjeets of the society would be advocated by the two great pillars of the Church and the State of England. The resolution placed in his hands was - That this meetiug deatres devoutly to gtve sl ry to God for that measure of mercies with which It has pleased Him to bLesa the :a-e l ,bours of the SocietY for the Propagatlon of the Gespel la F3r:1ga Parts.' It would be for him only to introduce the objects of the society, and for that purpose he would only mention a few facts in connexion with his individual experience in foreign parts, in order that the meeting might be enabled to see the extent of the efforts which the society were making for the spread of the Gospel abroad. After leaving Chester he was called to go to the Cape of Good Hope, and in a few months after his %rrival there he was appointed as chaplain to the First Division of the army then fighting against the Caffres, who were attempting to enoroach on the English territory. In that position he had many opportunities of travelling through the country, in going from outpost to outpost. During these journeys he came into contact with several thousands of our own countrymen, living there as coloniste and settlers. He at once represented to his diocesan the spiritual desitution in which he found the poor people ; but the answer he received was that there was no clergyman to send, and, if there was, no funds were in existence to support him. At last he undertook the charge of those settlers, and in a few months he found himself the only English clergymnan living in British Caffraria. At the same time there were 12,000 troops, and he was the only chaplain in ohasge of them. Besides that number there were 4,000 or 5,000 Caffre troops, among whom there was no one to attend to their spiritual welfare. (Hear, hear.) In 1849 there was only Dr. Gray living in the whole colony labouring to spread the Gospel in that country. Since then the efforts of the sooiety had resulted in sending to that colony seven labourers in God's vineyard, five for our ownI countrymen, and two for special labours among the Caffrel population. That was not the only good result of the' society's exertions, for in Australia and other parts of the world the same cause for thankfulness existed. The only thing required now by the society was the sinews of war with which to carry on the warfare against the power of Satan in the dark places in the earth. So palry and miserable was the amount of the funds raised that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had thought it not worth imposing a tax that would not realize a larger sum; the support formerly ven to the society by the Government had been withI=ravn; and now that the society was more than ever de. pendent on voluntary support he begged every one present to come forward, and by every means in their powar help to rescue those hapless people who were now going headlong to hell for want of the tidings of salvation. The progress of the society was encouraging, and such being the case let all present do all in their power to spread the Gospel through the length and breadth of the world. (Cheers.) The Right llev. the Bishop of OxvoRD seconded the resolution. Hlis Lordship spoke at great length, but the sentiments of his address were identical with those of his speech at the niorning meeting. The resolution was put to the meeting, and adopted unanimously. The Right Hon. W. E. GLADSTONE, on rising, was greeted with loud cheers. He said.-My lord bishop, friends, and brethren, I have undertaken to move a resolution, the purport of which is as follows:-" That the present crisis in India, together with the rapidly increasing field of labour opening out before the society, calls for extended exertion and support from Englishmen, to further the spread of the Gospel, notwithstanding the present trials and difficulties ;" and I think, my lord, that those who hear that resolution read wil be of opinion, as I am, that the speech which would best induce you to support it has been delivered already. (Cheers.) When, my lord, my right rev. friend expatiated upon the difficulties which, as he stated, he would feel after having addressed you and leaving nothing upon the ground but the shreds of fragments, perhaps you little anticipated what description of effect be was about to produce upon your feelings. Bat I beg you at least to consider if after three times addressing you he found himself in such a predicament as to place him in difficalty-I beg you to consider what is the condition of those who, after not only three but four of his addresses, have now to apply themselves to a subject which he, I think, may fairly be said to have exhausted. But I fear at this time the national suEcepti. bilities have been deeply wrought upon; and perhaps yoar passions will indeed, under the circumstances of the moment, permit liberties with and encroachments upon your time which, under other clroumstances, you would not tolesate. (Cheers.) And, therefore, addressing myse'f specially to the subject of this resolution, I will venture to lay before you the fragments of the fragments ol what my right rev. friend placed before you. Now, my lord and gentlemen, the circumstances connected with the welfare and the action of this society are so much better known to others who have already, and who will shortly address you, that I think I had better pass them by. I will only say I am one of those who have deeply rejoiced to see that, as years roll on, with tho demand upon its energie3 being greater, instead of decreasing in equality with its work, it has, from year to year, through the energies of its aupporters, and under the blessing of the Most High, deve oped energies more than adequate to the requirements of the emergencies. (Applause). When we saw Canada and the American colonies admitted to political freedom we found the missionaries of this society ready to give to those colonies, by religion, such a standing as they never had before; and, through it, to unite us most closely by the best and surest of aU the ties that can connect England with her colonies. (Applause). We saw the ohains struck off from the hands of the people; and when there were suspicions whether comparative barbarism admitted to freedom would be likely to insure social order, this society, together with the bishops and the clergy who were ready to go inito the field, took care that the power thus conferred should be used in a manner corresponding with the end of such a gift-an end which could not be attained except by a corresponding gift. And when we had made Australia the medium for all the moral scum and filth which could be shed by society in this country, and when it began to overflow past every bound, so that we were obliged to hold our hand, there, too, uninviting as was that field of labour, there, too, you found no diffioulty in inducing able ministers of Christ to go forth and devote themselves to the performance of good works-to direct in those distant landithe expansion of that religion which was sheddingslmilarblessings at home. And now we come to the occurrences that have given rise to the resolution which I now nmove-that two of the lightswhich hadbeenlighted in Indiaby thissociety- one at Delhi and the other at Cawupore-have for themoment been quenehed in gore, and the missionaries who were doing God's work have added their names to the noble army of martyrs. (" Hear, hear," and cheers.) My lord bishop, that misery is one which filis at the present moment the hearts of everyone. It is not as in a case where danger is at our door, it is not that the power and glory of England a3ss in danger, hut it Is the sufferings to which England has been subjeeted-England, who not only raised armies vrhich fought for EDgland-it is not only to those who were engaged in the pursuits of traffic or in the administration of the powvers of government, but it i: grief that the peaceful missionary of the Cross bas been deprived of his life -of the wife of bis bosom, and the babe of his arms. My Lord, why is it that at this moment this great visita. tion has come upon us ? Was it not time that something should arrive from on High to bring us to consider our position and our conduct ? For years England has been becoming more and more a spectacle to the world. During the last 10 years particularly we have witnessed an almost unexampled increase of her greatness and ber prosperity. We have had at once wealth and thefsecurity and the blessings of peace on the one hand, with the intoxicating glory and success of war upon the other. (Hear, hear.) We have seen great advanees in the condition of the people-an immense increase in au usA tue,I cnrfarelinrae nth omot in the trado of the country-a real inoreas_ein the cmot of the great mass of the population; and we appear to have ascended the ladder so rapidly that it may have made us forget from whose hands we received a these blessings. For, perhap, it may have been observed that a spirit had gone forth among us savouring too muoh of pride and negigoence, and recalltng the memory of those who in early times sought to scale heaven itself with the works of their hands. Oh, my lord, it is good that at this peculiar period we should be awakened by calls of thunder to think of Him from whose hand we have received al that we have received; in whose hand is all that we now possess, and whose creatures we ourselves are. And surely in the circumstances of this mercy there are likewise points so peculiar and characteristic that they sbould be carried home to us as of deep note. Now, for example, if there has been, as my right rev. friend has observed, one error which more than another has been cautiously avoided in India, it has been that of au I indiscreet zeal for the propagationofChristianity (hear); and, having a plied our own minds to the avoidance of that indiscreet zeZ what do we find now happens? Why, that this revolt has taken plaeounderthe belief-abelief which hasundoubtedly existed in the minds of the army of Bengalthat they were about to be made Christians through force, through the acts of the Government. I don't enter into the case of how far these things are due to the Government, and how far they are due to each of us; but as a people, having failed in our duty, and especially in our duty both with regard to the direct propagation of the gospel as to its doctrine, and by the exhibition of its beauties by example, it comes now that we see one of the armiee ralsed for our strength turned against us because of the belief which it has imbibed that we were about to force Christianity upon them. And, again, it might be said that there has not been a perfect observance of rlght and justice in all our proceeding in India. It is clear, however, that the persons who served in the army have been the speial objects of regard, consideration, affection, and indulgence from the Indian Government. Nay, more, among the different armies of India-for there are Fhree artnies in different parts of tha emplre-one has been chosen to be petted beyond all others, namely, the army of Bengal, and it Is that qrmy which has risen against uc~. The cause is a belief that those who have never attempted to make therm Christians-nay, would not permlt the. t~ hecorice Christians-were going to force Christianity upon them. (Loud applause). Now, ray lord, I think if we i ead the mnanner inx which Divine judgments come upon man, we may perceive in these great'national afftirs lesorns of the Divine purposes conveyed to us. Unfortunately, le ever tbere was a people who had cause for great national humiliation in respect of a great national crisis I do not hesitate to say it is the people of England at the present mnoment. But, here again, J. nust avosd going into a questi on of who is to blame and 'who is not to hlame. That is niot aquestion to besettled here. It i;, perhaps, aquestion. difficult to settle at all. India has been governed upon a system and a principle originally devised by the British Plarliament-a system by which it was thought necessary to dissociate the Government of that country from the popular institutions of this country. The effect of this moat carious contrivance for governing India was that tt made it to us as a foreign country ; and I do not hesitate to say that no man in England knows or can know India unless he has made or chooses to make it a subject of special study, as he would make the affairs of any other foreign countrv. (Hear, hear.) England knows nothing ofIndia Our public men even know nothing of that vast emptre, unles, indeed, they devote their' time and labour ha acquiring a knowledge of its atfairs. As they would learn the affairs of Rtussia so must they learn the affairs of Inidia, because we have contrived a system of govemrnment for Indlia which in- ossa rpntal cenbtenteodnrhbka and daily routine of governmentalaffais in England and the administration of Indian affairs. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, i do not at all presumne to enter into the question who is to to blame, or whether any one is to blame. It may be that it has been our own fault, the fault of our divided responsibility, the fault of our system of absolute secresy - it may hae sprunig from the difference in the system of adiministration in this country and that adminilstered in India ; hot, whatever the cause of outbreak, you mnay search the records of history f ar and wide before you come across an instance of so vexatious and extraordinary a failure on the part of a governing pwer in the administration of its political trust. (applause.) We go into that countcy with superior strength. We are acknowledged conquerors. The natives have metu; in the field, and they feel that their military genius issubo - dinate to our own. Their organization becomes our work, and our government in India hecame the admiration of the world. I do not believe that up to a few months ago anything could have apparently surpassed the manner ia which our lIndian government and our Indian army were organized. ln a moment the whole strength of our staff in India not alone crumables in our hands, but pierce ourbands at the same time;- and a6 great p art cf that immense country is to he reconquered by British arms. (Hear, hear.) If capable of being taught a lesson of humility, here are certainly facts teaching that lesson. We find that, after all we are not wiser or stronger than other people. We have suffered grievously at the hands of those whom, perhaps, we rega)rded as the feeblest of our dependents;- and it ou remiains for us to hope that we may dterive bEnefit and alvantage from the suffering (hea, hear) ; and, my friends, besides this cause of humility, our failure ought to teach us we have something to regret of the wrongs that have been done. I read an able paper In, I believe, the London Quarter-ly Review, and a passage in it expresses forcibly the relation in which this country stancls in respect of India. Speaking of the calamities, the writer say s :-II We may both console ourselves that they wera not merited from the people, and that they are not unmnerited from the GodL of our nation." My right rev, frienid the Bishop of Oxford spoke of the observance of the rules of justice in the government of India ; and I trust, with him, that the observance of these rolesi has direced the daily action of that Government ; but when we come to ask ourselves whether they discharged as efficiently as they maight have done the geat trust they undertook in that country, the question wl not be whether the Governme-nt of India was better than in the former times of bloody-mainded tyrants and ferocious conquerors, but whe. ther we, as a Christian people, had done all that we might and ought to have done; whether we acted as unselfishly as we ought to have actedl; whether we gave to the natives the full benefit of Christian example, and whether we set before themn a pattern of moderation, and truth, and justice, and mercy. (Hlear, hear.) I frankly own I fear upon. that score, when our account Is maade up, we shall have but a sorry story to tell. I am afraid, even at the present momnent, when we are humiliating ourselves before God, and inuploring pardon of sin andI a blessing upen English arms in India, our hands are not altogether clean. I do not go back to the old question of our conquest in India, nor am I disposed to take so strong a6 vieW as some have done of the general question; butI feel bound to pay our conduct has been, in many respets, the reverse of the conduct which a Christian people ous1ht to foci pride in pursuing. I am bound to admit that for t e last 25 years, during which I myself have taken par-t in public affairs, I have observed grievous instances of policy inx respect of our Indian empire, -measures undertaken without a shade of justice, and a perfect scandal to English history - and no page of that history hasa fouler blots upon it than that which refers to our Eastern polley. (A2ppaue.) Now, my lordl bishop, I earnestly hopo that, athough there is not a perfect agreement of opinion among the people of England with regard to these matters,-whlch in mny mind show a violation of public jtustice in our Easatern policy,-it is our bounden duty to offer a prayer to God that, first and foremost in these our efforts for the propagationL of the Gospel, we should ourselves be brought to a clear and distinct view of what is righiteous and unirighteous in our conduct to India, that our hands may be clean before we presume to make an offering upon the Divine altar consecrated to the propagation of the faith, But, my lord, while referring to the past,, we have to look to the futurxe. The question is, what is our duLty In this great crisis'? Soui ersons think that we should be well rid of the labour anUT the responisibility; and, on the other hand, some thin that England would bo no longer England it India -were to be torn from her. I believe, myself, there is nothing clearer than the duty of Englanud to usee every effort and exertion to keep her hold upon India (hear, hear) ; that there should be no sparing of resources-no sparing of sacrifices to reinstate the British power in peaceful possession of the whole of that vast territoy But, then, on the other hand, it Is not because I believe that the possession of India is necessary for the sustentation of the power m~d glory of England. Depend upon it it is no such t-hing. It is upon no such narrow anid selfish basis that I, for one, would urge the duty of using the ener-gies and the power of this great empire for the retention of our Indian possessions-it Is upon the ground of a6 solemn moral obligation. (Cheers.) The quaestIon is, not whether we were juLstified in the acquisition of the couantry or not; the question is not -whether our hands were clean or not in those acquisitions-I the question is, what obligations have we oontracte_d towards the nearly two hundred millons of people under our rule in India, and towards the Godi who cares for that people as much as for us. (Applause.) To fulfil these obligations truly there Is stil abundant work for England ; and for England to give up India woiuld be one of the greatest calamities that couxld lefa the people. I argue thus, not because of Ithe material benefits of the connexion, for, aft-er all these benefits are but of secondary consideration. It is not on account of the benefits to ourselves-for, after all, England would not perhaps greatly suffer in the essen. tial elements of her power; but It is because we have, perbaps,rashiy aiid presumptuoualy,placed ourslves in the condlition of trustees, standing between Almaight-y God on the one band and 200,000,000 of His creatures on the other ; and because it is our absolute dluty to dischagth trust. we so undertook, to the glory of God and the benefittbof these P ia creatures. Well, then, my lord, in what maxnner is that trust to he discharged? For my own part, I certainly do go the whole length with those who are of opiion that Christlanity is never to be enforced and neverto be propagated to the prejudice of justice ; and that we are hOuand, not in derogation to Christian principles, but in consequence of Christian principles, to abstaiin beth from force, fraud, andl from aniytliing that bears a resemblance either to force or frau-I, in respect to the propagation of the Gcspel. ("1 Hear, hear, " and cheers.) It appears to me that what we have to ask-that what this society and the people of England have a right to ask and exact froma the Government in India amnounts to this,-that the Government should separate itself from al practices-if any such practices there still remain-should separate Itself from any remnaining practices by which it appears to he implicated in the acknowledgment of the prevailing false religion and false worship of the country (loud cheers) ; and that having severed their own political and public action fromi connexion with those f alse religions the next thing they should do would be to establish a prfectfre domn and toleration of opinion. (Hear, hear.) Icnt do better than road to you a very few words which I find In a letter of Lord Shaftesbury's on this subject. He says,- --Aul that we resouve In IndiLa Is comaplete religious equaitsy, and If the Hindoos and Mahomedans, singly or conJolntly, eboosee to form associations for the liroinulgation of their creeds and Imitate our pro ceedluns let them do eo as freely as on"elves (hear, bear), provided they keep within the limita of law and order." (Hear, hear.) Therefore, that perfect freedom and perfect toleration-not nominal only-but an established eq,uality as o eerypolticl igh an prncileof religion in the eyes f th Govrnmet inIndi, isI believe, the first prinipl of hic Chrstinitycomands the adoptioni wit rear toou poicyintha cunty;because it would Christianty Its& if,, having obtained a vwroer the people of that country, which -wo certinly have not obtained by public right or law, we were to use it for the pur pcse of doig violence to the consecienoe of that people. But we have a duty beyond the establishment of toleration in India, and that is a strict adherence to propriety of conduct on the part of our European residents there-the avoidance of unjust and unnecessay wars-the avoidanoe of all countenance, and especially of all direct connexion and substantial connexion, with all demoralizing practices, under whatever name they may be veiled, and with whatever apparent practical advantages or necessities they may be allied. Indeed, my lord, I do not know how, although it is not always that the language of Scripture seems to fit easily into the notions of modern policy-but I don't know how the rules of our policy in India can be better described than in one part of the epistle appointed to be read in the services on Wednesday last-I mean a portion of the 7th ohapter of Jeremiah, in which it is said, IITrust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are these. For if ye througbly amend your ways and your doinzs; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; if ye oppress not the stranger, the father. !e3 and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt * then will I cause you to dwell In this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers for ever and ever." (Cheers.) In these words, my lord, I believe are conveyed the duties of the State and of the public as far as regards the governmuent of India. But by what means and by what agency, then, are we to discharge those immediate obligations which ap.- pertain to us in connexion with the Gospel of Christ? I must confess that I have great faith in that silent preaching of Christianity which Is connected with the general exhibition of Christian conduct both in the lives of private ilndviduals and likreise in the direction of public policy, For, in truth, in heathen countries generally, and, certainly not least of all over the vast Indian provinces, the sufferings the people have undergone iu former "mes from the eruel infiictions of wicked Governments have been such That there cannot be found on the earth a population more xeady to recognize and appreciate the differences between Cbristianity and a Christian method of government and hlia.henisca and a heathen form of government ; and, my lord, ve have the consolatiorn that amid present distress, as far as we are enabled to form a judgment, although the whole native military power of a considerable nortion of the country has revolted from us, yet, thank GoA, there is no evidence that the will and disposition of the people aye adverse (cheers); but, on the contrary, so far as we can tell, the great mass of those peaceful E,nd quiet Hindoos are disposed to aCquieSece in, nay, perhaps, ratber to welcome and support, the sway of the Britsh Government. (Cheers.) But if it be true, as'I believe it is true, that you cannot look to the direct action of your Government for the propogation of the Gospel-if it be not . nly contrary to policy, but to daty, that you should enforce on them that propLgation-then, I ask, is not the appeal made to you to-nightmade on strong grounds? For, if Vie can't propagate Christianity asa State and asakingdom, h y should we not propagate it as a church and as a Ieople ? (Loud cheers) Why not try our own indi%idual exertions and individual contributions, and eneeavour by prayer to strengtkeu the hands of those wbo are willing to go forth in this service-willing to Ira- o the dangers that the labours in such a land may tntail-willing to make sacrifices that we may desire, and u ho have, through the energy of this society, aud by the great and holy operation that it has conducted, done much to dispel the darkness that lowered around many nations of the globe. (Cheers.) If we answer to the appeal made to us to-night-if we and the rest of our fellow-countrymen do cur dnty in this respect, you may yet hail the day when the Bengal military rebellion broke out, for it may prove, afLer all, to have been the happiest day in the history of our Indian empire. (Hear, hear.) If we keep ourselves from whatever iniquity has been made publicIf we show that we are not ashamed of avowing the faith that we possess-if we establish that liberty and equality demanded by religion-if, as Christians, we increase the conversions to Christianity, through free persuasion and through the aid of the ministers of our church bring beuighted hundreds to a knowledge of the Gospel, then I say that a happier period may dawn than ever hia been known since our career of conquest began in India. It i8 often that good is given us through national calamities, and Iwill take for an example that great national affliction which occurred 10 years ago, when nearly 2,000,000 of the population of Ireland perished directly and indirectly through the devastation of famine. Now, that was a case Where we had none of the food and causes for humilation that we have on the present occasion. It couldnotbesaidit was owing to errors or blunders ofours that one of our articles cf human saubsistenee had failed to yield its product for the support of man; but it was a period of grief and afflction. The scourge went abroad throughout the land. For a time the inteligence grew more and more formidable, and altogether the sufferings of that land were such as hardly oa,n oe told. Bet there was a purpose-a Divine purposebehind. The period of affliction had passed away, and a new dawn of prosperity had come over Ireland (hear), and the people at this moment are i a state of social advanco. manet to which before that great affliction it appeared as though they never could attain. E:ven so let us hope it may he for India. (Cheers.) Let us hope that there, too, a better day is about to arrive. We feel that England has at this moment a great and even an awful vocation before her. She has got to administer sarict and stern justice; hut to administer it, as I truAst, even in a spirit of mercy which never can be separated from that of justice; and, above all, to recollect that vengeanc is not an instru ment which we are petmitted to take into our hands. The cry that went out from this country for vengeance was, I hope but the passion of the moment. Unhappily, we cannot tail to percelve that the going forth of that cry f2om some portions of the organs of public opinion in angland at once produced throughout the civilUzed nations of Europe a strong reaction in feeling unfavourable to us as regards the Indhan mutiny. (Hear, hoar.) And as to those Englishmen who are afraid thzat thaere w11not be enough bleed spilt to vash out the crimes of the mutir:eers, let me say that there cannot be any ground for such a fear. Thefrightful atrocities that have been perpetrated must necessarily kindle to the very greatest heat the passions of those whose duty it is to put down the rebellon in India. They do not require to be inflamed and insprited by mis. e*ves sent hence. (Hear, hear.) In fact, that severity, nay, even that rage which can beunderstood andaccounted for, w hich can bepaUiated and excused in those who have before them perhaps the reeking remains of Englsh women and children-those passions which may be excusable there hecome odious and unnatural when they are cherished here. (Loud cheers.) My Lord Bishop, it is indeed a tremendous responsibility which we incur if we feel itthat is, the Divine will and purpose of our standing and our power in India; hut, on the other hand, it is a glorya noble career which may be opened to England if our duty shall henceforward be fulfilled. ("Hear, hear, and loud applause.) It is impossible to measure-I don't say the augmentation of political power which England may derive from her Indian dominions-I, for one, do not believe that that is the great benefit which attaches to it; but it is im. possible to mseasure the real honour and the substantial glory of communicating to so vast a portion of mankind the blessings of civilization and religion. (Applause.) They are ready, I believe, to receive them at our hands, even in this dark day of our affliction and dismay. It has appeared as if such were the case, and now you have to say whether, so far as you are concerned, your portion of the work shaU remain undone, or whether, addressing yourselves to it, you will strengthen the hands of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, whioh is the appUled organ of the Church of England as a church, for the purpose of conveying these blessings to them. ("Hear," an loud cheers.) My lord, I hope I am not presumptuous in looking forward to the probable course of events. I trust that a lesson so severe and terrible shall not fall of good. Surely it is impossible that, humbled as we have been, we should fail to recognize our shortcomings-it is impossible that, regarding passing ovents, we shaU not search the utmost recesses of our own hearts-see what has been done and what is being done, and finaUy resolve that for tho future the past shall be a guiding beacon to ourselves as wfl as a warning to other nations, and that henceforward we shall go forth to the duties of governing -with a plain understandinig of its obligations. If that be so, then I am quite sure that to this society will be reserved a large share In giving effect to this principle. In the appeal made to-night on behalf of this society I would seek to interest you, not alone by passing the resolution now in my hands- I knowfyon will pass it without a dissen,ting voice,hut by resolvicng each said every one of you in your different spheres to aid as far as may be in promotin the advancement and civili72ation of the numan race, and, above all, to promote the dissemination of that one transcendent gift to man, the Gospel of our God and Savour. (Loud ap. plause.) The Rev. Mr. WELCh, of Liverpool, seconded the resolution in an able and effective speech, and it was unanimously passed. Thanks were voted with acclamation to the Lord Bishop, and after prayer the meeting separated.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE 'ITAES. Sir,-A etatement having been made in The Times of the 10th inst., under the head of " The Camp at AIdershott," to the following effect:-" Some fatal accidents have recently occurred at camp. Daring the evolutions of a field. day, when some guns were being dragged up the steep acclivity which leads to C esar's Camp, one of them unfor. tunately overturned, killing two men and three horses,"I shall feel obliged if you will give to it my unqualified contradiction, no aecident of any kind having ocourred during the present year, either to mnan or horse, of the Royal Artillery at this station, with the exception of that which resulted in the death of the sergeant of Horse Artillery, correctly reported in your impression above alluded to. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant. E. C. WADE. Colonel Commanding Royal Artillery, Aldershott DiOtrit.. Brigade-office, Royal Artillery, Aldershott, Oct. 12.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The fire which has just occurred on the Great Western line from heated wheels induces me to give pub. licity to the foflowing occurrence. I was travelling about a fortnight ago on the Midland line, from York to London, when the wheels of the carriage I was In became heated. While the official was pouring water on the wheels at Derby, seelg how little impression he made on the heated wheels, I remarked to him that It appeared to me hardly safe to proceed with the carriage. O Oh, yes," he replied, " it was far worse than this last week. The carriag e has been 'reported.' It is always getting heated.", At Rugby attention was caUed to the state of the carriage, and that was done whieh should have been done before,the carriage was detached. Its to be hoped, after the p roof we now have of the danger rising from heated wheels, that those who work the Midland will no longer consider it a matter of indifference whether the wheels of a carriage are liable to be heated. Your obedient servant. N. IT.
FuNEAL OF THE LATE EARL FITZZL IAr.- The remains of this nobleman were removed from Went. worth-house, near Rotherham, on Monday evening. Although It was the expressed wish of the family that the proceediugs should be conducted with as much privacy as possible, it is calculated there were not less thanl,000 persons congregated about the mansion. The greatest decorum, however, prevailed. At half-past 9 o'clock the mortal remains of the deceased earl, which were enclosed In a plain but rasslve coffin, were brought out of the house, and plad inan ordinary hearse, drawn by four black horses. Mr. Massey, the lat earl's rivate secretary, and some of the principal officers gf the aousehold, entered a carriage, and the procession then moved away at a slow pace to the ;Vath station of£ the South Yorkshire RaUlway. The night was extremely dark, and a solemn effect was given to the mournful cortRge by the tolling of the bells in the charches at Wentworth, Melton, and Wath, as the procession passed along the secluded road from Wentworth-park. Many of the villagers came out of their houses with lanterns to 'witness the last of the noble earl, who was greatly esteemed by the poor in the neighbourhood generally. The hearse and attendants arrived at Wath at 11 o'clock, where a special train provided by the officials of the Great Norther*f Company was in readine3s to convey the funeral vehicles to Peterborough, on their way to Marholm, Nortbamptonshire, the place selected for interment. The train oonsisted of engine and tender, two break vans, two firstclass carriages, three trucks for the hearse and carriages, and six horse-boxes The train arrived at Peterboroug& at about 3 o'clock yesterday morning. The members of the deceased nobleman's family left Wentworth for Mltonhouse, near Peterborough, on Monday, to be in readiness to pay the last rites to their deceased relative, The interment tnok place yesterday (Tuesday) in the family vault at Marholm. ERnATmr.-In the speech of Sir Benjamin HaU, at the Marylebone meeting on Monday, he is by a misprint reported to have said that the mutineers at Delhi had made a ' second" assault; it should have been a " severe" mssuit.
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE I -PROMOTION OF SOCIAL SCIENCE. I - - - i (FROMr OUR OWN REPORTEPS.) BIRM!INGHaAM, TURSDA.Y. While in Manchester art yet reigns supreme, Birmingham has been chosen s the seat of severer studies. A ' national association" under the above title was inaugarated here last evening, at the Town-hal, by an address from Lord Brougham, the president. The proceedings appear to have excited an amount of interest not confined to the town alone, as wvll be perceived by a glance at the names appended. The body of the haU was crowded, and on the platform were, among others, Lord Brougham, Lord John Ressell, Lord Stanley, tha Mayor of Birmingham, Lord Hatherton, Lard Talbot, Sir Fitzroy KeUy, M. ?I., Sir J. Pakington, MP., Maior Talbot, p r. Monekion LilInes, M.P., Right Elon. W. Cowrper, M P1., Mr. C. B. Adderley, M.P., Mr. W. Scholefield, M.P., Colonel Gordon, M.P., Sir T. Winnington, M.P., Sir B.

B ay Shuttleworth, the Rav. F. D. Maurieo, Sir E. Wilmot, and Alderman Salomons. The MAYOR having, in a few brief words, introdueed Lord Brougham to the meeting, His LoRDSHIP proeoeded to deliver the inaugural address. After some introductory remarks of a general character he proceeded:-Let it not be thought that your attention is called to positions too general or too elementary if we divide humaan knowledge into two great branches, the science wh!ch deals with abstract trnth and the science which treats ef real edistenees.-matter and mind, ornatural and moralacience. Of this the latter and mnost important relates either to man as an individual or as a member of the community; and this, or the poliftcal and soeial braneh, is most eminently deserving of attentive study. It is freefrom the doubts and contentions arising fromn metaphysical philosophy, because it deals not wich subjects whereof not a few are placed beyond the reach of the human faculties, but with more practical objects -the laws which govern men's habits and the prlnciples of human nature, upon which the structure of society and its movements depend; and respecting which safe oonclusons can with certain limits be drawn. It must be borne in mlnd that, although very few men are or can be students of mental science, the bulk of mankind are and must ever be political observers. The operations of their own minds searcely at any time engage their attention; but the action of the Government, the habits and proceecdings of the people, the conduct of other nations, their fortunes and their fate form the daily subjects of redection with persons of even an ordinary degree of inteUigence in every civilized country, and do not escape the observation of those living under rulers who prohibit aU open discussion. For cultivating this branoh of science, too, there are manifest and peculiar facilities. The facts on which it rests are more plain and tangible than those which form the ground of moral philosophy In its other departments. They are more obvions; tbey are in most cases perceptible to the sense; they are reducible to measure and calculation. The accumulation and distribution of publio wealth; the prosperity or suffering of the people ; the quiet or the disturbed state of the country; the diffsion of knowledge by education the moral iiprovement of different classes ; the action of the law and its administration upon the habits of the community; the benefits which may result from individual exertions unconneoted with the State; the increased eficiency of such exertions when made by bodies of men; tho just limits of publie interferenea with private concerns, whether for management or repression- the duty of the State in respect to undertaking woAs beyond the power of individual enterprlse, and the limits of those duties; the right and expediency of public interference with the anthority or the conduct of parents-these are matters of distinet observation, and are so connected with facts as for the most par to admit of exact calculation. Then of the permanent importance of these subjects, and the interests they are fitted to create beyond the other heads of moral science, there can be no doubt whatever. The story of national affairs; the events or the measures which change the condition and which influence the fortunes of the community in whole or in part; the rise and decay of institntions affectlng the welfare of millions; the course of a policy upon which depends the happiness, perhaps the existence, of a State; the changes in the structure of Government, or in its functions as bearing upon the concerns of the community at large-these are subjects of the deepest interest even in contemplation, but they press stU more upon our earnest attention because of their practical relations and the tendency of their discussion to produce active exertions for the general good in connexion with them. Lot It moreover, be remembered that the facts to which these inquirles refer, and upon which our inferences must rest, are necessarily of a public natare, and so much vrithin the knowledge of the world at large as to afford a reasonable security for their being carefully observed and truly recorded. History, statistics, the contemporary narratives of public events ,aud the details of national affairs are the sources from wLhich the political reasoner draws his materials. Established institutions, measures for adding to their number or extenaing their scope, attempts to modify some, or to alter, poseibly even to disponse with others; monuments of legislative vwsdom or error; enaotments regarding crimes and their punishment; measares of polce ; judiclal proceedings and acts of the State in executing the laws are the facts which the political reasoner generalizes, and on which he builds his system. WVhen the paramount importance of moral and political science is regarded, and the facilities for Its cultivation, from the nature of the evidence it rests on, are duly considered, It has struck observerswhose efforts are directed towards human improvement as somewhat extraordinary that the eourse should not have been taken here wvhich has proved so advantageous for assisting the progress of inquiry in the other great department of knowledgenatural philosophy; and they have strongly recommendel the plan of assembling together occasionally, perhaps periodically, the varioas individuals and bodies whose attention is devoted to the aseertainment, illustration, and general exposition of moral and political doctrines. It is very possible that in the end this object may be obtained, and that the association which we are met here to open may bear as wide a relation to moral and political science as the British Association, which has now been in successful aotion for considerably more than a quarter of a century, does to mathematical and physical science. At present, however, a more limited view is taken.lb Is proposed that five of the most important branches of moral and political inquiry should be singled out-those which especially form the practical portions of social sience-comprehending the plans, both in their details and in the principles that shonld govern them, for furthering the improvement and securing the stability of the social system ; correcting the faults and supplying the defects of our institutions upon sound, rational, and temperate views, and rendering desperate all attempts either to check the progress of improvement or to gratify the wild desires of those who would destroy rather than amend; in a word, steering the middle course between those who regard aU ohange as pernicious and those whom no change wiU satisfy. But if our subjects are in some mneasure limited, the scope of our deliberations is anything but narrow. It embraces the greatest temporal interests of mankind. In the first rank-indeed, at the head of the whole-must deservedly be placed jurisprudence and the amendment of the law. Jurisprudence was described by Air. Burke as "the pride of the human intelect, and with al its defects, redundancies, errors, the collected reason of ages, combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of bunman concerns." But among these redundancies and errors very many are almost of necessity the growth of time -the "great innovator," as Lord Bacon has lt,-changing, though slowly, even imperceptibly, yet surely and without intermission, the circumstances of society; whUe a reluctance, grounded on a wholesome dread of rash alteration, bnt carrled oftentimes to excess, hinders us from adapting our laws to the new state of things, and thus the retention of the old rule occasons the very shock which it was wished'to avert, as the steersman too anxious to avoid the stream may be stranded on its bank. After remarking upon the difficulty of arriving at an exact and logical division of the various departments of inquiry which the Association proposed to discusa, the noble and learned lord proceeded :-Bnt it is manifest that we are taking a right, in some sort, a necessary course, in bringing together those who chiefly devote themselves to promote the inquiries and the meaaures connected with social improvement; and this position appears to rest upon most solid grounds, both from considerations common to all joLit undertakings, and from the peculiar nature of the subject itself. Of the former description is the great advantawe which must accrue from the mutual help afforaed to one another by fellowlabourers in the same cause- the increased efficacy thus given to the efforts of each; tue lights struck out by faU disoussion, wi1th the valuable suggestions thus produced, the experience, the reflections of each individual being made as it were comn.on to all; the security against error by timely examinat-ion of each plan before its author's prepossessions have become too deeply rooted, and before he has been committed to its details; the authority given to proposals ultimately, and after mature dellberation persevered in, even if not sanctioned by the assent of others; the inflaence which may be acquired in various ways when that sanction has been declared. These advantages attend all such unions, and may be cited in favour of any combined operations, whatever be the nature of the subject. But there is a peculiar expediency-it may rather be said necessity-for such a common or united action where a great variety of opinion is likely to exist upon many matters, possibly no universal concurrence upon all thc particulars of any one. Placing all prejudices arising from diversity of political party or religious sect entirely out of view, and assuming every person to be inspired with the pure and single desiie of pertorming his duty towards the community, it is still unavoidable that men should view the same subject in different lights, and that the absence of such standards from demonstration or experiment as the reasoners on other scienceS canappeal to should create doubts and introduce diversities of opinion. In some cases these dt. ferences may yield to fulldiscuasion, but in not a fewinstances they will remain, and here is precisely the inestimable advan. tage of such an union as ours. That discussion and explanation may often remove the grounds of dissent is undeniable. We have classical authority for observing that how widely soever men may differ in their reasonings upon hnman conduct, it is singular how seldom they differ much in the judgments which they form respecting it. We mal* go f urther and affirm that there is less diversity of opinion than might have been supposed even upon general subjects, and that Ignorance or misinformation, or inatentive and therefore inaccnrate observation, or careless refiection and hasty declaration, is the canse of most of those differences. However that may he, we sumrnon those whio honestly differ in opinions, because they regard the same subject from different pointa of viewr, fo look at both sides, when po%ibly they may be found to agree, and because it 2s of inoslculaboe impornoce that those points on which they are agreed should be Beparated from tho rest, and the meesures apIroval regarng which no material difference exists. In the abstract science itself of necoesary trath, though there be very few, yet there are some uncertainties of speonlation, but they are never suffered to interrere With results on which there cannot any doubt exist. No one in constructing tables ever stopped to exAmine the well-known controversy between two of the greatest analysts on the logarithms of negative quantities. But in the science of contingent truth there are, of course, many more instances of conflicting theories; yet the wide difference between tlio theories of electricity and of magnetism Is altogether disregarded by those who would frame the mechanism of the telegraph. The maker of telescopes inquires not Into the osinparative merits of the Newtonian and the undulatory doctrine of light; and if that illustrious man, the ornament of this neighboariood, had waited until the various theories of heat could be reconciled, or one system be adopted to which none could object, his immortal discoveries and inventions vwould not to this day bave armed man with the vast power which he now possesses, and changed so entirely the face of the world-that world benefioently created for our admiration, and worthy of it, disfigured though it be partially by our follies and our crlmes. Upon the beneficial effec6e of united action in its different applications I can venture to speak from an experienee of some duration and considerably varied. It may suffice to mention two instnces of this successful operation. About 30 years ago the Society was founded fomlDiffusing l_TsefullKnowledge, its obiect being to bring the different branches of science and of literature within the reach of the great bulk of the conmunity by reducing the cost of books, maps, and prints to avery moderate scale, and by preparing various works at once didactic and attrative. The committee which carried on these operations consisted of 60 persons among the most eminent in scienco and literature, ancient and modern, wirth members of three learned professions, and distinguiahed statesmen Regular weetings were held to receive reports of subcommittees charged with preparing the various works composed either by their own members or by authors who were employed. Every matter was discussed by the general committee, both on the writings submitted and on the new works to be undertaken. The most severe examination hd been applied by the sub-committe but the proof-sheets were urther submitted to the wlole of the members, who had to consider both the substance and the manner of treating it; and even those who on any subject might not feel competent to criticize the scientific pert exercised a vigilant superintendence over the style, so that errors in composition and offences against correct, even severe. taste were sure to he detected. Now, the gret number of our members, Profitis.c, moreover, by the communications of about 70 locau committees and the advantage of constant interoourse among the members of the central body, enabled the society in the 20 year of its active operations to publish not only with unbroken regularity treatises twice a-month, but various other works not given periodically. Above 200 volumes have thus appeared. The circnlation of the scientific works frequentl reached 25 000, of those in more general use 40,000, while of the &I discourse the circulation was 100,00, and of tne1 weeklyor'Penny lagazine it exceeded 200,000 ; and this gave rise to works of a like description, as did also the scientific treatises, so that the effects of the soclety'a labours were not circumscribed within the clanes among whom its works circulated. And it further had the satisfaction of finding that the prioe of books, maps, and prints was exceedingly lowered, while their numnbers were greatly multiplied. Cheap literature lwas found to be the true interest of authors as weeL as publbhers, and was no longer confined tolightreading, but extendedtoworks of scienoe and art, prepared with unremitting attention to the explanation of all tecnnical terms and all obscure allusions, and removing whatever obstructions are found in the path of the learner; so that the youth of humble station could no longer be met by those distressing difficulties, both in expense and in the want of truly didactic works which had before made the pursuit of self-education all but hopeless. A still more important service, however, was rendered by teaching professional authors and publishers that there is X market for true and substantial knowledge among the people at large. Other important incidental advantages accrued from the society's labouzs. One of these advantages was that many works, some of them periodical remar-able for their ignoranoe and folly, and others filled with ribaldry and scurrility, and of a hurtful tendency towards the interests of both church and State, were discoutinued. Another benefidal consequence was that the translAtion of several of the society's works into many European languages, as of the preliminary discourse into six of them, and some Oriental tongues, gave rise to the establish. ment in some countries-as France, Holland, and America-of insSitutions on a similar principle, and leading to similar publications, It has been inaccurately stated that the society has ceased to exist. It is a body incorporated by Royal charter, and cannot be extinguished unless by a forfeiture. In fact, although for some years it has not been in active operation, because almost all the purposes of its institution had been amply fulfilled, yet as soon as its interpositlon was required, it stood forward, and I had the honour of presenting to the House of Lords its petition against the removal of the Great Exhibltion from London to Sydenham-a Iproceeding which ras felt, to deprive the working, and even the middle classes, of the helps to the acquisition of knowledge furnished by the Exhibition while it remained In town. There is even less foundation for the other charge brought against the society, that classical studies are undervalued in its publications. Works issued under the sper. intendenoe of the first scholars of the day-the Maltbys, the Arnolds, the Thirlwalls, and others, are not likely to be the just objects of this grave reproach; and all the members of the committee well know that they had been repeatedly but falsely accused of too great a devotion to classical subjects-subjects and studies which lay the solid foundations of pure taste, and, had they no more substantial merit, are most sweet, as relaxing the severe brow of Escience- "-duIoes ante omnia musm, "Quarutn et aura fero, ingenti erculsus amore." But the other experience to which reference may be bad is that of the body whose objects approach most nearly to our own-the Society for Promotin the Amendmentof the Law. It would not be easy to describe ths many pernicious attempts at legislation which it has stopped in their earliest stages-attempts tendin to the injury, not to the amendment of the law; and, if endlng in failure and its attendant exposure, calculated to bring the great cause of legal improvement Into disrepute. But it is more pleasing to dwell upon the signal benefits that have accrued frem the measures maturelv digested and strenuously promoted which have obtained the sanction first of the public assent-that is the approval of those wlho are capable and well informed-and, finally, the assent of the Legl4ature itself. To give particular instances would only weary those who are familiar with the history of the society. But I am bound to state tbat since its establishment in 1844 most of the Bills which I have brought forward, and of which many have been pissed, making a great change inour jurisprudence, either originated in the inquiries and reports of the society's comnuittees, or owed to the labours and authority of that body valuable help towards, first, their preparation, next, their adoption. Tho great measure of local judicature, and those which arose out of the common law and real property commissions, were no doubt adopted prior to the society's foundation. But many of the Bili extending and improving those measures are materially indebted to its cooperation. One instance is better than any general descriptlo*. Of the nine Bills presented bv me to the House of Lords in 1S45, and six of which are now the law of the land, two of the six were suggested by the society, and another, the most important of the whole, and vwhich has Entirely changed the course of procedure, the Act for the Examination of Parties in all Suits, I never should have succeeded in carrying but for the society's correspondence with all the County Court judges, and their almost unaniumous testimeny in favour of the change. Take another instance. Of the legal improvements in the session that has just closed, the most important are the Divorce and Fraudulent Trustees Acts. The former was mainly furthered by the inquiries of committees, by the public meeting held on the protection of married women under the presidenev of Sir John PaLington, and by the BiUs which the society prepared, and whlch were presented the session before; while the latter (Fraudulent Trustees Act) originated in the inquiry and report of a special committee of the society upon the subjcet. Nor should we pass over a very important step taken by the Government in conseqsuenco of the society's urgent remonstrance against the grevous defects in our judicial statistics. The elaborate discussions in the conmittees, and their conclusive reports, aided by the indefatigable labours of Professor Levy, have had the effect of introducing a material improvement in that department, and, great as the imperfection still is, so as to make the returns not deserve the name of judicial statistics, we have nowv every ground for hoping that, at length, the Legislature will have the means of ascertaining the effects of its Acts, and no longer rentinue to pass laws in the dark. This subject will deserve the early attention of our first departmentnor is there any other matter that appears so much to press for consideration, if it be not the continued refusal of equitablo jurisdiction to our local courts- a refusal not easy to be comprehended, when severalyeoarrs ago we found some of the first solicitors in London delart, in a petition to Parliament, that they never shotld thilm of recommending a client to sue for an equitable debt of go little as 1,000L The various efforts made to obtain thia rceasure of strict justice have received the aid of the scciety, and much important information has been obtalned, though ayet all those attemptshave failed. But the society has also afforded proof of the valuable results obtained from combined action in the two mereantile law conferencos which it convened and conduoted in 1852 and 1857. Prior to the former year no systematic attempt had been made to obtain the opinions of the mercantile classes throughout the kingdom on the state of the commercial lsw. Indeed, it is comparatively of late years that the establishment of those valuable institutions, chambers of commerce, has afforded the means of selecting delegates from our mercantile towns; and when, in November, 1852, the representatives of a number of chambers met, under the direction of the society, to discuss the assimilation of the mercantile laws of England, Ireland, and Scotland, a new era certainly began in our commercial legislation. The result of that conference, which was re- s- ed over by myself on the first day, and by Lord Harrowby on the second, was tho appointment of a Royal commission to inquire into the subject which had ocupied the attention of the delegates. The com r miossners, all men of high reputation and tried ability, accumulated a great body of evidence, and published the re, suits of their labours in a, valuable report, which recom, mended an extensive assimilation of the mereatile laws i the three portions of the united kingdom. This retort ha' not been allowed to remain a dead letteri the two Merckn. tile Law Amendment Acts of tho session of 1856 were founded upon itz recommendation, and though these measures -undoubtedly fal rshort of what mlght have beeii hoped, and still leave inuch to be done in the waiof assimilation, they must be regarded as Tery usoful a&ditions to the statuto-book, and are, we may truast, th precursors of further improvement The seoond Vercantile Law Conferenoe ilk TfmuarY lst ii of too recent a date to enable us to dwell upon its results; theri cannot, however, be atn doibt tkj th will be,
HA YMARI.ET THEATRE. The revival of the Iore Cuhase last night aScrded Miss Amy Sedgwick an opportunity of presenting herself to tha London publio in a new character, of a kind totally different from that in which she first courted metropolitan applaure. As " Neighbour Constance" she more thani fuzfilled the pro. mise implied by her performance of Paulino, gaily fling off those fetters that seemed to check her in her more serious impersonation, and allowing fulU scope to. fumnd of native spirit and vivacity, the existence of which was rather to be guessed than demonstrated before the exhibition of last night. If the laugh with which she antered upon tihe stage had not the musical ring of Mrs. Nisbett, it vwas hearty, free, and uncontrolled, and was, moreover, an earnest of the vigour with which she delineated throughout the most vigorous of stage beauties. Througb the whole representation there was nothing done by halves. She was thoroughly jocund, thoroughly vexed as occasion served; laughedwitbh all her might and cried with all her nighti in short, was just the person to terrify a father into gett'ng rid of her. and frightening a lover into making her his partner for lifpe That bliss Sedgwick was a completely disciplined artist was shown by her Pauline. The question whether there vax genuine spirit and feeling at the foundation of the training is now answered in the atiirmative. Although Miss Sedgwiok was the most interesting obNect of the evening, the revival mnst not ba classed with those huddled-up exhibitions that frequently take place icr the sake of a single " star," the general cast showing a. deter, mination to produce as efficient a representation of the lively comcdy as the state of histrionic art will allow. Mrs. Mars. ton, an excellent actress, little known at the 'Westend, had apparently been engaged for the express purpo i of playing the Widow Green, and depicted that buxom dame wvith a de. gree of unction aud evergreen luxuriousness that has not been seen since the days of the late inimitable Al ra. Glover and she had a suitable lover in the hearty, self.sxtisfied Sir W'ihiau Fordlove, personated by Mr. Chippendale. Ihe responsi. bilithes of Wildrake were well met by Mr. Howe, who vwith a great deal of humour rendered Gspecially prominent the sulkr surprise consequent on the abortive attempts of the won d-be town gallant to dazzle the vivacious and clear-sighted Constance. The stout young squire felt that he had done his best to be Wree. able, and thiat it was all of no avait, so he had; perfect righ: to be as sulky and stupld as ho pleased. The sernous interest. which is the weakest in the piece, Ws sustained by Mr. W. Farren and hIrs. Caroline White, who did their best with the unthankful charcters of Mtaster Waler and Lydia. The audience, which 'was very numerous, esinced the highest satlsfaotion r.t the comedy, which, performed as it was, came out with exceeding freshness.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 157. It is no small consolation for our Indian calamity that it has proved tho happy occasion for an almost zinprecedented national reunion. All parties, all classes, all schools ; Liberals, Conservatives, and 3Radicals ; men of war, and men of peace; they 'who lh.d much to expect from Government, and they who bad nothing; Churchmen and Dissentera, have a}l forgotten their differences under the influence of a common humanity, and on an appeal of the most touching and iiniversal character. :Here and there comes out a slight difference of opinion as to the causes of the misfortune, the persons answerable, and the degree of prescience, promptitude, or skil displayed by those wvhose business it was to prevent or arrest the catastrophe. But no opinions on these points have been suffered to mar the national nuaiiimity of feeling and purpose, to qualify sympathy or divert the Mow of benevolence. The blood of our murdered countrymen, their wives and their babes, crying from the ground ; the utter bereavemeent and unspeakable anguish of their survivors, have, indeed, pro ved t hat " touch of nature" which we are told c; makes the whole world kin." They who have thus *perished innocently, but heroically, are our friend3, our wives, our cnildren. That is the one feeling 3vhich qui.ers on the lips and glistens in the eyes of all who can venture to talk on a subject which often checks utterance, or allows of that entering into details wlhich rather disguises than gives vent to the *rue feelings of the heart. It is the one thoutight Df speakers and hearers, whether in the country f;own or the metropolis, whether in the Church or the Towvn-hall. Some variations of opinion have eome up, or rather revivals of old differences, such as the (qiestions of caste or conversion, but never were differences so gently and charitably discussed. WVhy do we mention all this that everybody knows ? WVho denies it ° It is not denied. But there is one laiuentable exception; only one. It is forced upon us. Gladly would wse shut our eyes and our ears to it, but it is obtruded and dinned into uIs. lhe Roman Catholics are resolved that they shlall rtand ouit in odious relief, as the only people in I these islands who in this solemn hour have no heart -Tor the fate of their countrymen, the distresses of the survivors, and the disaster of the country. 'They are determined to show themselves wvholly exempt from British sympathies and regards. WWhethc,r they fulminate a " pastoral," or write a ' leader," or send a private letter to their corellgionists at home, or inspire an Ultramon- lane journal abroad, or show themselves at i a p-ablic meeting, it is alvays the same story. I 'Th9y carefully repudiate every national weal.-. seaa, &xu proclaim themselves the un-Eng1Erl('n un-insular, cosmopolitan Papistb, taking not even a dispassionate view of the country. W.hatever the view, the result is that they deliberately and most unnecessarily inform the public that they don't mean to subscribe a farthing to the relief of vulgar, temporal distress, to mere worldly widowhood, to secular orphanage, to profane want of food, clothing, and other creature comforts. Perhaps we might have guessed this without their telling urs. But they won't leave it to surmise; tbey are deterrmined that we shall not only knowv, but know that they know that we know that every sixpence they subscribe will be given to priests, monks, and nuns, and the general work of proselytism. A Marylebone meeting for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian Mutiny might have been left to take its own course, which was simply that after a few speeches, feebly representing what every Englishman tbought and felt about the matter, aU present should subscribe as much as they could afford-generally more than they couldc well afford, and take some steps for carrying the appeal home to their absent neighbours. No sooner, however, had the first resolution, which was simply an expression of syrmpathy, been seconded, than off went a Rev. Canon O'NBAn, who, after hoping that he did not intrude, and thinking nothing so wrong as to disturb unanimity, proceeded to explain at length what his friends intended to do with their money, and give a vindictive colour to the intention by ripping up an old grievance out of the Patriotic Fund. It's altogetber wrong, Canon O'NEAL declares, what we have said. The CA.DiN.Ai's letter has been grossly misrepresented. Here, then, is the simple truth. We ody mean, says the Rev. Canon O'NEAL, to apply collections to fitting out twelve priests, and so forth. He then goes on to show, that as his friends did not get their share of the general fund of relief subscribed in the late war, so they are determined to appropriate their own charity exclusively to the propagation of their creed. Well. Did we say more than this ? NWe mics the point of the defence. It sounds to us like a fellow at the bar saying, " It's a bame cahlmny,-very hard ! I never stole a "sixpence in my life. I only put my hand into "that gentleman's pocket, and, findinfg a purse, "took it out of his pocket and put it "into n,ine." If MIr. Canon O'NxEL is really dissatisfed with our way of stating the fact, we readily accept his. The only difference is that, whereas ve only ascribed to the adroit CARDTIAL an intention of capitalizing the Indian MIutiny for the extension of his Church, Canon O'KEiL now explains that the said intention is not only rather vtilgar and selfish, but also a piece of retaliation. He informs usj that it is a way of settling accounts with the dispensers of the Patriotic Fund. Into that quarrel it is unnecessary to go. It is not the custom of Englishmen to mix up questions in this way. They take a question on its own merits, and if anybody is confessedly doing -what he knows to be wrong they don't pay much attention to his remarks, by the way, on an old affair. This gentleman admits that the Roman Catholics won't give a sixpence of their collection to the general fund for the relief of the distress caused by the mutiny. That i5 enough People won't trouble themselves to listen to a history of the past quarrels between Romish priests and British comnmittees from the mouth of a gentleman who makes this avowal and defends it. Unfortunately, and we say it with the most imfeigned concern, this is only a sample of the line which Roman Catholic zealots have thought fit to take on this occasion. They have evidently adopted the wretched sentiment that England's distress is their opportunity. Whenever one's eye lights on the observations of a Roman Catholic at home, his colleague at Rome, or his translator at Paris, it's always to find that England is now reaping the fruits of her long crimes, that her time has come, that her persecutions are now visited on her own head, that the victims of her oppression are rising; or some other stuff of that sort more rancorous still, and more stupid. A Parisian contemporary the other day, by no means so bad as some others, congratulated the world upon the spectacle of England on her knees on the Day of Humiliation, beseeching the ALM1GIITY to avert the consequences of her sins, and intimated that there was now some hope of England, as she had come to a sense of her enormnities. Why, what worse impiety than to put a bad construction on an act of religion? Are Roman Catholics never seen on their knees? Do they never confess themselves or afflict themselves publicly? W7hen we go into continental churches and see a lady come out of a c nfessional, does an Englishman of ordinary sense and feeling remark,-" Ah, poor " lady, no doubt she has a great deal to confess" ? We see hundreds on their knees in foreign churches. We know that they observe Lent more strictly thall we do, and have other ordinary and extraordinary times of contrition aud devotion. We know, too, that all classes perform acts of penance-public ones-known to be such by everybody who witnesses them. Is it understood, then, in the religious circles of Paris, in Rome, that religion is an invariable sign of immorality, and that any act of penance indicates a deed of darkuess? We certainly had supposed. a different view of the subject; but we do now find, to our perplexity and sorrow, that this is the view taken of a solemn religious act by leading lRoman Catholic authorities here and abroad. What a wicked nation England must be to humble herself so ! She has no longer a word to say for herself. poor sinner! There she is, down on her knees, endeavouring to avert the wrath of HEAVEN for her abominable crimes ! Well, we frankly confess that ours is an humbling religion. When we humble ourselves we are aware that it is not only in the sight of GOD, but also, what is harder to most people, in the eyes of man. We have heard somewhere of the Cross being a stumblingblock in the eyes of the Jews. It appears to be so now in the eyes of the Papists, Who have lately shown a most remarkable identity of sentiment, whether religions, social, or political, with that oppressed people. It was a distinguished individual of the latter race who took the lead in jesting at suffering and deriding penitence. We may now find the type of this kind in our Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen and neighbours. They know the mnost pious and charitable interpretation to be put on suffering and self-abasement. Thank HEAVEN, though we might have welcomed their sympathy, we cannot say we depend upon it. We are Englisisnien, and we are members of the Church of England. In this country and in this communion we expect to suffer without being set down as offending more than all other men; and we expect to acknowledge meekly the chastening hand of the ALMIGHTY, without having that made tlle pretext of a new calumny.
Mr. BEREsFORD HoPR's speech on Education at Maidstone is a proof how impossible it is for any man of ability aud sense not to be something of a Liberal at the present dVTr. However strong a IHigh Churchman he may be, and whatever value he may attach to Catholic, tradition, the Fathers, ancient liturgies, copes, encaustic tiles, emblems, services, seasons, ceremonialsd uiile3s he forcibly transplants himself out, of his age and. forswears all coanexion with it+. he will show the taint in soe way. He will 'aow it without positi.vely aban- loning hiis schcal'. Very few persons r,ill everewn that they hav-givea.up an opinion which t onfie, held ; they will speak of themselves as being exactly the same they always were, but it will be perfectly plain to spectators that they are much modified. The truth is, it is much more difflicult to think the whole world wrong than people think at first. Half-a-dozen young theologians of five-and-twenty, when they are together, feel themselves quite strong enough to defy the world; they tune each other up to concert pitch; their self-complacency is prodigious; they are aU the world to each other, and vote aU outside of the little circle to be heathen men and publicans. It is astonishing what a very small numerical strength satisfies men. We believe that there never was a sect which numbered five hundred which did not practically think itself the whole world. Fill a moderately sized room, and forget-which is easily done-all who are not in the room, and you have forthwith the most triumphant consciousness of number, and feel that you could subdue the earth if you chose. But tako one of these half-dozen gentlemen ten years afterwards and see if he practically holds his old ground. He has in the meantime come into contact with facts, he has met conscientious, serious men, who differ from him, has talked with them and heard what they have had to say for themselves. Of eourse, he thought them completely wrong, still the fact has impressed him. Hle cannot prevent the action of the inevitable laws of moral mechanics. We are supposing all this time that he is a man of sense, and does not think that an opinion which he took up a dozen years ago is necessarilytrue simply because afew earnest young men-several years younger then than he now is -laid it down for him. He has seen much real good in varying moulds ; he has met with true religion under man.y schools; he cannot help facts, they arrest him in spite of himself; and, without giving up his old vocabulary-for abandon- ment appears something gratuitous and requiring explanation-he begins to add some new phrases to it. He speaks of different schools within the Church, and of opposite doctrines, which both represent great truths. This is called the influence of the world by some people, and is considered the great temptation which the Christian has to resist; but we are disposed to call it the force of facts, and, so far from blaming people for giving way to it as if they were simply yielding to the flesh, we think- such acquiesence a modest, calm, and religious use of reason. The school to which the name of Tractarian has been given is not a very favourite one with the English public; but we must, as impartial observers, allow that a Tractarian of the present day is In most cases a very different person from the Tractarian of twenty years ago, when the movement was young and fierce; he is no more like the rigid, exclusive, and doogmatic denouncer of that day than the present moderate Evangelical is like the -extreme Predestinarian of the days of Naw ToN or SCOTT. His circle of sympathies is enlarged, his dogmatic zeal is much calmed down, his general tone is tempered, and he acquiesces in the comprehensiveness of religion, not as a necessary evil, but as on the whole, a benefit. Mr. BERESORD Hori's speech at Maidstone shows the heartiest sympathy with all the great characteristics of the age in which we live. He stands up for manufactures, for large towns, for the business, activity, smoke, and enterprise of 19 th century Ergland. The only features of England w hich some of our High Church writers have been able to tolerate are its qtuiet villages with their church spires, cottages covered with woodbine, modest parsonages, picturesque shecs, and squires' mransions hidden among the woods and shrubberies half a mile off. The country, with its green lanes, hedgerows, and running brooks, the ploughman's whistle heard in the next field, and an occasional cart or wheelbarrow grinding in the distance, has been pronounced a consecrated region, devoted to serenity, purity, and religious contemplation, while the populous town has figured as a festering mass of corruption, appealing to missionary zeal, indeed, to save souls out of it, as brands out of the fire, but exciting no sort of sympathy or admiration; as if the great characteristics of our manufacturing centres, their energy, application, patience, and perseverance, were simply fits of diabolical inspiration. M. Ho P expressly rejects this contrast of town and country, and claims for the populous city its proper praise as a creation of PROVIDNzCE just as much as the village. He says, what is quite true, that the clergyman and the schoolmaster meet as many difliculties in the viUage as they do in the town. He does justice to the liberality of the millowners And the care which they often take of their hands : "It is as well to see how much they are doing thme for the education and comfort of the people, and to find how happy the working classes may be in those great miUls which many are too apt to look upon as the scenes of grinding purse-proud tyranny on the part of the master, and of hopeless toil and suffering on the part of the operative. I had one day the pleasure of vLsiting one of the largest mi1s in the north of Bngland. I found the operatives looking the very perfeation of happiness; the building was fireproof, the ventilation admirable, the people em. ployed cleanly, cheerful, and Intelligent." The old contrast of town and country is an instance, indeed, how men will trust a pretty picture against facts. Everybody who lias had anything to do with rustics knows that they have exactly the same faults as operatives in towns ; that they are just as self-willed, as inaccessible to persuasion, as careless, and as sensual. But because the ountry makes a beautiful picture and a town an ugly one it is supposed that virtue and religion have selected the country as their favourite seat, and have deserted towns. True piety has, in short, been investe d in the i nagina- tion of these persons with all the characteristics, tastes, sentiments, an d predilections of a lande d proprietor of ancient family. She is supposed to dislik-e the noise, dirt, and vulgarity of streets, and to prefer smooth, well-shaven lawns, areen shrubberies, a park with deer, if she can get one, and a pleasant, undisturbed prospect up to the horizon. She is the Lady of the Manor, and cultivates friendly relations with the Heralds' College. She writes armigera after every rent-quittance, warTant, and obligation. She is fortunate in noble c onnexions, and if she is not descended from Romo the Norman, or frorm r that patriarchal Standard-bearer Of WILLIA1 the CowQuJ-zaoN who has such numerous offshoots in the Peerage and Baronetage, or from one of the Barons who signed the Magna Charta, or from one of the leaders in the Wars of the Roses, she, at any rate, abhors any nearer connexion with commerce than that of a Lordl ayor of London in the 17th century. The very latest period at which she caMe dcown from "town" was before the glorious R Revolution of 1688. She goes to church now with her train of servants and tenantry, and she waits patiently for that more perfect bliss which she will hereafter enjoy " as the owner of a great estate in "1 Heaven." The contrast of town and country in which some of our religious writers have indulged has betrayed this lurking fondness for the aristocratic element in society, and has been, in truth, more allied with a certain kind of worldline?s than, perhaps, they wolld be wiling n to confess. The town is the worl d and the country is the Church to thema; but. the truth is the. town is plebeian, and the- oountry is aristocra c.. Let them not be quite so sure that, while they so religiously abhor -the noisy world of a. populous town, they are i nt themselves indulQing! a worldly principle in doing so, and ttWf' their hearts are wt. all this time a little tca..much- with the ruighty of the r.w-th who live t lvQuntre seatrs i- se vh.-whila they I i i pretend to 'be making the distinction bettreen the I pauperes Christi and the wealthy millowner, the real distinction in their hearts is not between the vulgar millowner and the hereditary aristocrat. In such a case, the distinction may be justified or not by the laws of taste ; but it is a mockery to say that it has anything to do with the principles of religion.
The machinations of crime and the resources of justice appear pitted against each other with a horrible prominence in the appalling transaction which for the last day or two has received its periodical notice iu our columns. From vestiges of the most imperfect character, and by inferences of the acuteat kind, it seems placed beyond doubt that a dreadful murder has disgraced our metropolis, but whether the deed can be brought home to its perpetrators, or whether it will be buried in the obscu-. rity which at present envelopes it, is a question yet remaining to be determined. We can only hope that where, under such difficult conditions of discovery, so much has been brought to light, the rest will not be permanently hidden. On Friday last, in the gray of the early morning, some lads rowing up the river observed a bundle resting on one of the abutments of Waterloo-bridge. It proved to be a capetbag, locked and corded, with a considerable portion of the cord hanging down into the water. The boys carried off what they believed to be a prize ; but when the bag was opened it was found to contain the mutilated fragments of a human body. Twenty pieces of what had recently been a living creature were exposed to view with every incident of horror. Limbs had been sawn into bits, flesh had been hacked from the bones, the trunk had been disenibowelled, and the head was wanting. So complete had been the comminution of the corpse, and the obliteration of all the external features of humanity, that it was only by indirect conclusions that even the sex could be established; and yet from these and almost inscrutable data a story of some coherence has already been framed. The bag contained, besides these portions of the body, a complete suit of apparel, coat, surtout, waistcoat, trousers, drawers, socks, shirt, and under-shirt, the hat and shoes alone being not forthcoming. No mark or other means of identification could be discovered on any of these articles; but they were pierced in various places, as if with a sharp knife or dagger, and they had all been ripped up the back-the overcoat as well as the rest-apparently while on the person. The front parts of the dress, too, especially were found saturated with blood. The fragments of the body itself seemed at !irst to promise little testimony, but under a scientific scrutiny they yielded enough to establish the first certainty of crime. A portion of the chest showed a distinct stab or hole, corresponding precisely in position and direction with one of the cuts found in the clothes, and it was proved by the evidence of the divisional surgeon of police that this wound must of necessity have been inflicted during life. The testimony to this important point was positive, clear, and sufficing. With equal success was it established that the remains could not represent the relics of any subject employed for purposes of anatomy. Not a single trace was found of the dissecting knife. " A Cc medical man," eaid Mr. PA^YrERl in his evidence, " must have wanted a body either for " the muscles, nerves, arteries, or bones. The "muscles, nerves, and arteries, I can most posi"tively assert, have not been dissected, and the "bones have been destroyed." The deductions drawn from the appearance of the fragments extended a little further. The state of tho joints showed that the right thigh must have stiffened completely at right augles with the rest of the body, and the right arm had also stiffened with the forearm under, and pointing in the direction of the trunk. It had been observed from the first that the body had been salted or soaked in brine to preserve it, but a certain portion had escaped the action of the antiseptic, and it is jueed from this that death must have occurred upwards of a week before the discovery of the remains. The cuts in the shirt exceeded in number those found upon the body, but this discrepancy was explained by the evidence that the portions of the body which might have displayed these particular wounds were among those which were missing. To this evidence certain additions have been' derived from other sources. The clothes found in the bag appeared to be of foreign make,-the socks have been pronounced to be uudoubtadly of (ferman manufacture, and the shirt-collar was obviously intended to be worn turned down over the necktie, from which circumstance it is reasonably inferred that the deceased person was not a native of this country. Here, up to the present time, terminates what may be called the internal evidence of the case; by one incident only are we brought into contact for a moment with those probably cognizant of the crime. It happened that the tollkeeper on duty at Waterloo-bridge on Thursday evening took especial notice of a woman, or a person in woman's apparel, who had passed on to the bridge from the Strand side with a carpetbag in her hand. This bag he assisted her to lift over the toll-stile, and observed its pattern so particularly as to be able to identify the article, to the best of his belief, with that in which the remains were found. He remarked that the wonman appeared agitated, and so much in a hurry that he imagined she was hastening to catch a train at the Waterloo station. Her voice was decidedly masculine, but she seemed only about 5 feet 3 inches in height. To the best of his remembrance she did not come off the bridge again. She passed about half-past 11. Such are the features, as at present discernible, of this most horrifying case. By the aid of a little latitude of interpretation and conjecture an approximation has been made to the supposed particulars of the crime. That the deceased was murdered with all his clothes on, including his overcoat, appears plain, and it is supposed, from the satiuration of all the front portions of his apparel with blood, that he lay dead on his face. In, this position-the position immediately resulting from the murder-it is conceived that the body stiffened, and that it was found necessary to rip the clothes all up the back before they could be removed from the rigid limbs. To prevent the decomposition of the corpse pending the further proceedings, recourse would be had to the process of salting; and at length, when the work of mutilation had been-completed, it was attemptel to dispose of the remains by dropping them in'ao the river at the end of a rope, se as to avoid a, splash. Such is the manner in witich the outliLes. supplied by direct testimony have been filled uF. by inference or surmise, and, though the conclusons, may, of course, be ermoneous, it is impossib& to overlook the detection to wlieh guilt bas become liable through- one or two fortaitous circumstances. Had anothr rbridge been selected instead of WVaterloo-bridge by the beater of the bag there would havs. beer, no toll-taker to depoce to the one overt a6hin tiisd dark transaction, and' the fact points to. th&e probability of the sceno of the crime havizzw-. lain, in the vicinity. IHad the bag, again, ncibAodg( d on the abutment of the bridge, instead o.faiing into the water, the portions of the udy..- which it contained nmight have disappear e%, illee the rest, and every vestige of the crime ha.ve been lost. Ther' . in-oe incident connected vwith this investigatiw .1 *Aticb, is suggestive of rather al;.rrnng conclusions, and to which it is desirable, we think, that attention should be drawn. No xooner was it knowvn in the raetropolis that a body had been discovered, admitting possibly of xome identification, than application was made by a succesaion of persons-eight or nine, we are as3ured, in number,-each of whom within the last month had lost sight of some relative or friend for whose disappearance no reason could be assigned. It would be dreadful to think that heinous guilt could prevail among us undiscovered; nor are we, indeed, of opinion that any such conclusion need be accepted. In a population approaching to three millions it is natural enough that instances of eccentric ty or accident should remove individuals now and then from the cognizance of their friends, while the foreign extraction appaiently attributable to the victim on this occasion tends of itself possibly to withdraw the c3se from the category of ordinary crimes. On the whole, though it is certainly not agreeable to think that ia the present day persons c3n disappear unaccountably in the metropolis of Britain, we are not disposed to believe that such occurrences need be connected with secret outrage or undetected crime. The present examDle, we feel assured, is an example of its own kind alone, and we devoutly trust that before many days have elapsed we may experience the satisfaction of announcing that justice is on the track of the guilty.
The Constitutionnel-we beg pardon-M, H. M. ABTARTi, a writer in that journal, is much aggrieved by the remarks which we made in commenting on his lucubrations upon the subject of the Belfast riots. He accuses us of adroitly turning them into an occasion of attack upon the laws and institutions of France, and of drawing invidious comparisons between her system of government and our own. He charges us with profound ignorance" of the vast amount of liberty enjoyed by his countrymen-of their communal, departmental, and national assemblies-of their agricultural meetings and Industrial fetes-of the freedom of their Pulpit and their Bar-to say nothing of their Institute, where every one is at liberty to speak exacly what he thinks, or as party spirit may incline him. The only thing wanting, M. MARTnY admits, to complete the happiness of this earthly paradise is the passport system, about which accordingly he says as little as possible, leaving us very much in the dark as to his real sentiments on the subject. For the rest, he says, France has had quite enough of foreign constitutions; whenever she has tried them she has burnt her fingers; henceforth she will have none but a government sorti de ses propres entrailes, adapted to her own peculiar genius-a Government which gives her security within, grandeur and glory withoutthat is to say, which gives her that w7iich she f(tied to obtain under the ttwo Englis,5 charters which were imposed upon her, and which she possesses at present under the Empire which she has freely ancd unanimaously acclaimed. Now, with all submission to M. MA-Rxr, we must beg to protest against being dealt with as the provokers of this controversy. Nothing was further from our thoughts when we replied to the C0ot.stitutionnel than any wanton attack on the Government and institutions of France. We freely admit that our own institutions, however superior we rwty deem tthem to those of France, are not suited to the genius of her people; nay, we have the authority of some of her most eminent statesmen for saying that the Englishman's idea of liberty is absolutely unintelligible to a Frenchman. The latter confounds liberty with lawlessness-the former associates law with liberty. Into the causes of this difference we cannot now stop to inquire, but the fact is undeniable, and the results of the two systems are displayed in the adoption of what M. MAnTiN caUs the preventive system in France, and the repressive in England. But it was not we who threw down the gaumtlet to our neighbours across the Channel. It was they who, in an excess of sympathy for our troubles, pointed out the disease under which they conceived we were labouring. Englisluhen, they have often been told, have an unfortunate perverseness of temper which prevents them frorn knowing when they are beaten, and bythe same rule they are unable to discern when they are enjoying too much of a good thing, if liberty be entitled to that name. That, at least, wS the complaint which the Constituttionne,d made against them, ua we, in defending our countrymen against the charge of preferring individual freedom to the welfare of society, could hardly avoid pointing out some of the fruits which the opposite system had borne in France. We really do not see that we have anything to qualify or unsay. It matters nothing to us what form of government our neighbours prefer, so long as it continues to be exercised with benefit to themselves and without inconvenience to us. We caunot, indeed, deem any system free from inconvenience which assumes us to be all a parcel of rogues and vagabonds, and compels us, when we land on foreign shores, to carry about with us a document similar in character to that which in this country we impose upon convicts when at large. This, however, is an inconvenience not peculiar to the present or to any r&gime in France which the present generation has known. We should be glad if we could inspire our neighbours with some portion of the disgust with which it is regarded in England; for they may be assured that nothing would tend more to improve the good understanding which subsists between the two countries than the removal of this odious restriction on personal liberty.

INDIA. ADDITIONAL DETAILS. Th'e following Appe&red in our third edition of yaterday:-1 We have been favoured with the following ;- " The following telegram has been this day (Tuesday, 13th of October) received at the gast, India-house, viz. :_ "CALCUTTA, SzF7. 9, 1857. " GENERAL HAVELOOK'S COLhMN AND LUCKNOW. "General Havelock was still at Cawnpore, waiting for reinforcements, and Lucknow still unre)ieved. The 90th Regiment, about half the Fusileers, and a 9-pounder battery, in all 1,270 men, were at Allahabad on the 3d or 4th. Six hundred infantry and the battery were immediately pushed towards Cawnpore, and General Outram was to follow with the remainder of the infantry on the night of the 5th inst. He expects to join Havelock on the 11th or 12th, and has directed the latter to have everything ready for crossing the river on his arrival. Meanwhile, we have intelligence from Lucknow up to the 2d inst., when the garrison wore in good spirits, and sufficiently provided with food. They had recently repulsed a determined assault, and had disabled the only heavy guns belonging to the assailants. " The garrison have been told to hold out to extremity, and we are now confident that they will be relieved about the middle of this month. " BENGAL AND BEHAR. " The Rewah troops detached, as reported in last message, to intercept the Dinapore mutineers were not in time to arrest their progress; the latter crossed the Tonse River about the 26th ult., after some detention by high floods, and their march has been marked by plunder. They give out that they are going to Delhi The rebel Kooer Singh fled from Rohtas about the 27th or 28th ultimo, and sought refuge in the Rewah Territory. The Rajaa warned him off, -whereupon most of his Sepoy adherents deserted him. A column, consisting of a wing of the 53d Queen's, 27th Madras Native Infantry, and some guns, left Raneegunge on the 27th ultimo, and wil clear the Trunk Road. The Nepaul Durbar hasgiven l,000 Ghoorkas to aid in the occupation of Chumparuxi and the districts on the left bank of the Ganges, which are endangered by the abandoam ent of Goruckpore by the civil officers. It is thought that the force stated, which left Eatmandoo on the 13th or 14th ult., will suffice to restore order in those districts. " DELHI. "Our latest accounts from Delhi extend to the 26th ult. The Punjab reinforcements mentioned in last message reached camp on the 14th ult., and more recently an auxMiliary force of about 2,60() men from Cashmere has marched to join the force. It is expected to do good service. "A new siege train from F erozepore is expected by the ond of August, and the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab calculates that by the middle of this month the force before Delhi will be little short of 15,000 men. This estimate may be somewhat too high. There has been the usual skirmishing, with the samo result. On the 12th tlt. a battery which was troublesome was taken, and on the 25th Brigadier Nicholson attacked the insurgents, who were trying, in a large body, to get to our rear, entirely defeated and routed them, and took 12 guns, with aU the ammunition, equipage, and baggage of the enemy. " The troops are in good health and spirits. Wounded doing weL Supplies abundant. It is said that some overtures have been made by, or on behalf of, the King. They will not be entertained. The garrison have been levying contributions in the neighbourhood of Agra and the North-Western Provinces. " AGRA. "Late3t intelligence from Agra to the 25th August.-All stil in the fort, and general health good. Nothing particular had occurred, - except an expedition to Futteypore Sikri, and another to Hatteraas, which latter defeated the insurgents, but was nlot strong enough to reoccupyAllyghur. The Furruckabad Newab is said to be on the road between that place and Cawnpore With three regiments of mutinous infantry and one of cavalr3 He will be dealt with by General Havelock's column, after the relief of Lucknow. On the deserting of Goruckpore uy the civil officers a Chockedar from Oude took possession. Anarchy and confusion in the district, and Ohumparun consequently in some danger, as mentioned elsewhere. Azimghur and Jaunpore have been occupied by the Ghoorkas who marched from Goruckpore with the civil officers. "NATIVE STATES. "The mutineers of the Gwalior Contingent, joined by those from Indore and Ilhow, reckoned at 4,500 Infantry, 900 Cavalry, and 30 guns, are still believed to be at Gwslior, held in check it is reported, by Scindia. " The PoliticalAgent, Major Macpherson, writing from Agra on the ,th ult., expresses a confident belief in his loyal and friendly attachment to us. The peace of Bhopal is imperilled by the open mutiny of the Contingent. All the Bundelcund chiefs continue to behave well, as also the Newab of Jowooh and the petty States of Dhar, Dewass, &c.; none having openly revolted except Anijhera. In Rajpootana native chiefs quiet and. apparently true. The conduot of the Nizam's Government at Hyderabad admirable. Mohurrum Festival passed off without any commotion or disturbance whatever. Puttialla, and all the Stlilej chiefs, continue in active and zealous co-operation. Gholab Singh, of Cashmere, died on the 2d of August; his successor is, as he was, our stanch adherent. " PUNJAB. "Intelligence from the Punjalb is to the 15th of August. Punjab and Cis-Sutlej-States quite tranquil. Large local levies are being raised to supply the place of the reinforcements gone to Delhi. Gholab Singh, of Cashmere, before his death promised 75 lacs to the 6 per Cent. Loan, and about 20 were expected in Cis-Sutlej. It will probably draw nearly a crore, which is the estimated want. The disarmed 2Gth Native Infantry at Lahore murdered their commanding officer on 30th of July, and broke away from the cantonments. The troops sent in pursuit took the wrong road, but the mutineers were foilowed by the police and tne people ot the country, and in the fist days of August were either destroyed or captured, and executed; hardly a man has escaped. Fugitives of the 55th Native Infantry at Peshawtur have been seized, and similarly dealt with. These vigorous measirea will probably deter others from similar at'empts. " G. F.

FO1EIGN INTELLIEGBN. FRANCE. (FROM O.UR OWN COORRZONDZNT.) ITho followig appeared ln our second edltioa of yes. terdhy :-1 PARIS, OcT. 12, 6 P.b. The crisis in Madrid still continues. Had it been terminated last night I should now have been able to transmit you inteUigence of it. Our information by letter reaches up to the evening of the 8th inst. On the 7th Bravo MIuriUo reached Madrid and presented himself before the Queen. What passed at the interview is not known, but on leaving Her Majesty Bravo Murillo told his friends that nothing, bad been arranged, and that he would not undertake to form a Ministry. The Bole inference to be drawn from this is that, either on politici or persons, he could not agree with the Sovereign. His friends declare that, notwithstanding his conduct in 1852, when, as they awsert, motives of political rivah-y impelled him to outstrip the dictates of his judgment, he is determined on not lending his hand to a coup d`Wtat. The Queen, whose Absol tist tendencies are no secret, may have found herself disappointed of expected support, but it is quite as credible, if not more so, that the difference concerned persons. Bravo MuriUo, before taking office, may have stipulated for the removal of certain courtiers, female as well as male, whose intrigues, and their infuence with the Queen, render it almost impossible for any Ministry to remain long in power that does not truckle to their exigencies. Whatever the reason, the fact of the refusal is certain; and, until Bravo MuriUo's objection can be overcome, or another Prime Minister be found, Spain may be said to remain almost without a Government, since the present men, wihile vwaiting for their succes,sors, transact as little businees as posqsible. This state of things is damaginz to the Throne, and renders the Government ridiculous. On the 5th inst., and again, it is said, on a later day, the Queen proposed to Narvaez to remain in office umtil the Cortes assembled, but he positively refused, for he well knows that he would instantly be turned out by a vote of the Congress, where the Bravo Murillo party and the Polacos would unite in opposing him. According to my letters from Madrid there was no talk (beyond mere coffeehouse reports) of a probable fresh combination. General Larocha's name, lately put forward, was no longer mentioned; nevertheless, according to all appearances, it would be necessary to form some makeshift Cabinet, created to fill a gap and destined to a brief existence. If Narvaez and his colleagues get impatient, and insist on giving up their portfolios, somebody must be found to sign the acceptance of their resignation. People still persist in talking of an interview between the French and Austrian Emperors as likely to occur before long, and they now go so far as to fix time and place. About the middle of November, it is said, the Emperor Napoleon will go to Munich, to return the visit paid to him at Paris by the King of Bavaria, and there he will find himself with the :Emperor Francis Joseph. Despatches were received to-day at the French Foreign-ofce from M. de Bourqueney at Vienna, and it is asserted they have reference to the meeting. I believe there is little doubt that M. de Bourqueney has been exerting himself to arrange such an interview, and even that he is sanguine of itstaking place. If the Emperor does all that rumour has marked out for him, his autumn will be well filled. He is to pass a month at Compiegne, and to visit Munich, Marseilles, and Algeria. 'The only grounds I can discover for the report that he will go to the last-named place this year is that he asked Marshal Randon which were the best months of the year for such an excursion, and that the Mlarshal specified October and November. A visit of the Emperor to Algeria might be productive of very good effects as regards both the European and the native population, particularly if he were able to remain long enough to make his observationis, and pass through the greater part of the country. It is not improbable that therecent discovery of abuses in the Administration (as well as the recent conquest of Kabylia) has contributed to direct his attention particularly to that colony. An official report has been made to him by the Minister of War with respect to desirable modifications in the Arab bureaux. This report will, it is thought, be followed by a decree maintaining those bureaux, but considerably altering their constitution. After having been on the brinkL of a recaU, of the certainty of which he did not conceal his own conviction, Djemil Bey, the Turkish Ambassador at Paris, Is likely to retain his position. The fall of Redschid Pasha, consequent on the British Government's reversal of Lord Stratford's opposition to the Moldavian re-elections, made it probable that his son would be included in his disgrace, and I understand that Djemil Bey has been preserved from so doing in some measure by the attitude of the French Government, which, while insisting on the carrying out of the Treaty of Paris, did not desire to see the question become one of persons. The Brussels .Yord lately said, and the Jour?al des Debats to-day confirms the statement, that the French Government has given to that of Engrland unequivocal proofs of sympathy and goodwill on the occasion of the Indian insurrection, has offered to permit the passage of troops through France, and to use its good ofrfices with the Pasha of Egypt to induce him to afford a similar faOility. I assured you In a former letter that, notwvithstanding what a few persons augured from the Stuttgart interview, the French Government never set a higher price upon the English alliance, or was more desirous to maintain it, than at -he present time; and you may depend that, whatever be the sentiments of a portion of the French press and nation, the Emperor has testified great concern at our Indian misfortunes. He, doubtless, manifested his feelings on the subject when at Osborne, and aIso most prob ably at Chalons to the Duke of Cambridge, with whom he had a great deal of conversation concerning the campaign in Bengal. The Nord says that the English Cabinet dec:'ined the above-mentioned offers, but adds, that it is everywhere seeking reinforcements, and 'i resolved, if necessary, to send the whole of its army to India, and keep only the militia at home. There is no saying what might be done under the pressure of necessity, but, making the largest allowances for possible losses from climate, disease, and the enemy's lire, there seems scarcely a reasonable doubt that the force already sent or under erders to go will suffice to suppress the revolt. We hate seen what has been done by mere handfuls of men under Havelock and others, and it emboldens one to believe that a force sufficient to take Delhi, and two or three moveable columns of 5,000 or 6,000 men each, will suffice to extinguish an insurrection which owes the greater part of its temporary success to ouzr want of foresight and preparation. As regards the passage of troops through France, I hear it said that It was declined by the English Government because there would have been little saving of time, owing to the double embarcation and disembarcation. The Presse of to-day makes the following reply to those of its Parisian contemporaries who have lately assailed England for not converting the Hindoos to Christianity:- " We beg to remind thcse who condemr the English for not having converted the Indians to Christianity that the Monarohy of July, the Republic, and the Empire abstadned 'ith equal care from undertakdng anything against the religion of the Bedouins and Kabyles. Nobody has blamed them for thus abstaining, which we consider most prise. worthy in the double point of view of justice and political Admiral Bouet-Willaumez, who lately commanded the French Levant squadron, will, it is expected, shortly be appointed to a seat at the Board of Admiralty. By a telegraphic despatch received to-day from Chalons Camp, we learnx that the last detachment of the Guard left it this morning. The manufacturers of Paris are in general doing a considerable amou:t of business, but they complain of the scarcity of money and of the difficulty they experience in collecting their debts. Many manufacturers, who delivered their goods on an un- dertaking to be paid at the end of three months, have, at the expiration of that period, been fored to accept a portion only of their demands on account. Others have been compelled to accept in payment bills of exchange, which they find great dif- ficulty in getting discounted. This scarcity of ready cash is g eneray attributed to the over-specu - lation of commercial men in railway shares and other public securities, which they are now unable to dispoe of except at an enormous loss. The country shopkeepers in particular having, since the establishment of railways, a larger capital at their disposal, as they do not find It necessary to keep up so large a stock of goods, have, unfortunately for themselves, bee n dealing largely at th o Boisra, a nd now that the season has arrived for renewing their stocks they are unable to pay cash to the manufacturers. The heavy rain and cold wind experienced in Paris last week have produced an active demand for warm clothing, of which the shopkeepers have profited. Many families have returned to town, and are making their usual purchases at this season. Fresh orders for various articles of Parisian manufacture continueto arrive fromSpain. OrderBfor low-pricedjewelry are likewise received from the French colonies. Flour in Paris has fallen to the price of the moat plentiful years; and it has become so abundant in all the marketa that it is difficult to dispose of it even at the present low prices. Last week the best marks, after afall of 4!, were quoted at 5Sf. the sack of 157 kiogrammes. On Tuesday last there was a sale of flour by public auction, and it was very difficult to make sales. Dar'Dlag's mark brought from 53f. 75c. to 541. 60c.; Baron d'Aubin's, 52f. 50c.; and inferlor marks from 4Sf. to 51f. The controllers of the bakers' fund, which authorized the Paris bakers to withdraw 20 sacks of flour from the reserved stores on snaking a deposit of 1,780f., have refunded them that sum on their replacing the 20 sacks of flour in the stores. This arrangement gave rise to somae purehases of flour on the part of the bakers, and these purchases tended to maintain prices. The factors declared on Saturday 4,800 sacks of flour, of which 337 were sold, for irmmediate delivery, at prices varying from 48 to 54 francs the sack, and the remainder, for future delivery, at prices varying from 44 to 48 francs. Wheat continues to be offered in the Paris market, and has decEned one franc the hectolitre-20 francs 66 centimes the hectolitre was the highest price obtained. Good quality was offered at 19f. 33c. and 20 francs. Excellent wheat from Loraine was offered, if taken from the merIchans' stores, at 19 francs the hectolitre. Telegra|phic despatches announce thle market al!Arras on the 10th inst. not well supplied, and prices without variation: wheat from 17f. to 211. 60c. the hectolitre; oats, 8f. 50c. to 10f. 75c. the hectolitre. Chartres market not sufficiently supplied, and wheat firm; sellers demand higher prices. Dijon, few sellers, nevertheless wheat has declined 60c. the quintal; sales have been made at 23f. and 24f. the 100 kilogranes; flour, 44f. the sack of 125 kllogrammes. Nancy, wbeat firm, and demanded at 22f. and 22f. 60c. the 100 kilogramnes. Orleans market well supplied; a fall on wheat of 70c. the hectolitre. The price of silk continues to decline in the markets of the Drome and the Ardbche. Raw silk is offered at from 80f. to 8Sf. the kilogramme. Spun silk has fallen 20f. the kilogramme since the last crop. The vintage being now concluded, we are in possession of details of its resulte. The produce of the vineyards in the neighbourhood of Paris, Champagne, Loraine, Alsace, Le Sancerrois, Le Nantais, and L'Orleannais is equal to that of a good ordinary year as respects quantity, but the quality is vastly superior. In Lower Burgundy the produce is excellent, but in the Maconnais, the Beaujolais, and the Cote d'Or the crop is not more than half a fair average. The Bordelais, the Gironde, the Dordogne, and the Gers, having been attacked with the oidium,will not produce more than one-third of an average crop. The Roussillon has suffered still more, and will not give more than a fifth. Languedoc and Narbonnais wil, not give more than half a crop, in consequence of the late rains and snow. In the Vosges the vintage has surpassed in quantity and quality the most sanguine hopes of the vine-dressers. In the Vlenne the quantity is deficient, the quality excellent. In the Doubs there is both quantity and quality. In the Bouches du RhOne, though the oidium has committed some ravages, the produce is magniicent. In the Hautes Alpes lt is merely tolerable. Spirits of wine are rising in the Paris market. Those from the south are quoted at 160f., and those from the north at 110f. the hectolitre.

Y7esterday evening the semi-official Zeit coomnnioated to its readers the following narrative of the progress of the King's illness: " To the bnUletins already published wve are enabled to add, on perfectly competent authority, that an improvement has so far taken place in the King's state of' health that His MWajesty, although very debilitated, has nevertheless the free and conscious use of all his limbs, and distinctly apprehends and recognizes all around him. When His Majesty was, on Tuesday, the 6th Inst., induced by a feeling of increasing indisposition to give up hls trip to Prlmkenau, and to return from Berlin to Potsdam, his state of health did not give the slightest grounds for expecting that symptoms wvould supervene of a nature to arouse the gravest apprehensions. In compLiance wiith the requi:ements of his medlcal advisers, the King betook himself at once to bed, and then fell into a sleep, wvhich, with slight interruptions, lasted tUll far into the night, but unfortunately brought with it no increase of strength. On Wednesday, however, no symptoms of an alarming nature showed themselves, and the night of Wednesday passed off indifferently well. His Mlajesty felt himself on Thursday morning free from fever, but in the afternoon Of that day a violent determination of blood towards the brain supervened, which gave rise to the mOst lively apprehensions for His Majesty's life. The bleeding, to which recourse was now had, produced a more tranquil state, which gradually assumed the character it has retained until the forenoon of to.day. Although we are not as yet in a position to speak of all danger as at an end, we are at least entitled to indulge in fresh hopes. The Queen attended Divine service in the Friedens Eirche yesterday to implore the favour of the Almighty for her beloved Consort, our Xing and Governor, in this his most imminent danger, We are convinced that the petitions Of all his faithful subjects will join her pious prayers,and that to-morrow's Sunday will fiud the clergy of all confessions united wiith their congregations in fervent supplications for the further preservation of our beloved King's life." This concise and official statement will be found to corroborate my more weighty and circumstantial narrative of yesterday, which gave you an account of how step by step the Ring's slight indisposition became an illness of great gravity. Fortunately I was enabled to close that narrative with the an- nouncement, that during the day an unexpected change for the better had taken place, which was in this wie:-Shortly before noon theEiKng awoke from the state of torpor in which he had for many hours lain, and, at his ownsuggestion, rose from bed. Little expected as it was that he would rally suddenly, or that he would rally at all the improvemaent in his state contlnued through the day, and even during last night, with the natural result of increased strength and promise of recovery. The buUetin drawn up last night was as follows:- " In the course of the day Hi Majesty's determination of blood to the head has very materially diminished, nor has it increased again even when evening drew on. " San Sonci, Oct. 10, 8 o'clock p.m." The bulletin of this morning shows continued improvement:- " His Majesty the Khig has slept for some time and perf ctlyoalmly, but feels on awaking languid and feeble. The symptoms of pressure on the brain diminish more and more. " San Sonuc, Oct. 11, 8.30 a.m." The news I have received this forenoon from Potsdam represents the King as progressing rapidly in the reacquisition of strength and the hopes, even of his medical attendants, become more and rmore sanguine. Eis mental faculties of perception and reflection show themselves as rapidly gaining distinctnees and preCion, and his appetite was such as to admit of his taking breakfast, and it is confidently hoped that, with due care, and a mfficiently prolonged abstinence from all harassing business, he will be enabled to resume his monarchlcal functions, and eventually be entirely cured1 of his illness. For my own part, with every desire to believe in the probability of his Majesty's entire recovery, I cannot bring myself to be so sanguine. His present st;3te is neither unexpected nor unprecedented; he had a similar attack last summer at Pillnitz from the same causes, and his physicians have looked forward for the last two mouths to a return of it, continuing as he did to disregard the imperative necessity of his constitution, and of rest and tranquillity. Eis participadon in the autumnal mancuvres, the interest he took in the Evangelical Conferences, the numerous visitors at his Court this summer, his own frequeat excursions hither and thither, have all taken place under the frequently renewed protests and remonstrances of his physicians, who have not failed to point out the inevitable consequences of his overexertion. at the conclusion of his course of waters and bathing at Marienbad, in the beginning of last July, the King's life was worth 10 or 12 years' purchase; thereupon, however, he immediately took his ill-advised journey to Vienna, in the great heat that then prevailed, instead of seeking that rest and quiet which experience has shown to be indispensable after a treatment with mineral waters. On his recovery from his comparatively slight attack at Pillnitz, his physician, Dr. Schonlein, said to him, " This time it wlas s.heet lightning, your Majesty; take care that the next time it is not forked." The King has not taken care, and the thunderbolt has struck him, but not so entirely without warning as that figure of speech would lead one to understand, for he has had of late a great number of premonitory symptoms in the way of sudden obliviousness, &c.; so that on more than one occasion he has left a speech unfinished from having lost the thread of thought or from inability to find the necessary words. These circumstances bear out the opinion that for some little time past, dating from the period of that last attack at Pillnitz, in the middle of July, the King's brain has been, in some degree, softenlng, which may or may not on this last occasion have been aggravated by the rupture of a small bloodvessel. Be this as it -may, and " who shall decide when doctors disagree ?" it is evident that the chance of HIs Majestys prolonged possession of the throne of these realms is sadly dimiihed within the last few days; and, much as every man acquainted with this country and with the excellent qualities and distinguished talents of the King would bewail any change in the occupancy of the throne, that contingency must be now looked upon as brought very close within the range of probabilities. The Princess of Prussia was expected to arrive at Sans Souci yesterday, so that now all the members of the Royal Family, without exception, are assembled at Potsdam. On Thursday last her Royal Highness was surprised with a visit at Coblentz from the King of the Belgians, who was coming down the Rhine on his return from Italy. In the morning His Majesty had breakfasted with Prince Metternich at Schloss-Johannisberg. AUSTRA (rRosi ouv owN co:&=sroi!IVSL) VIENN4, OCT. 10. The opinions which were a few days since expressed in my correspondence in respect to the probable result of the meeting of the two Emperors at Weimar are now generally entertained in official circles. The reconciliation between the two Monarchs will naturally lead to a rapprochement between their Governments, but their relations ara not likely to be intimate until the question of the reorganizatiori of the Danubian Principalities is definitively settled. This Cabinet keeps a very watchful eye on what is passing on the Lower Danube, and it has not escaped its attention that Russia is fast regaining the influence which she lost in the Principalities when the war began. Speeches were made by influential Wallachians on the nameday of the Emperor Alexander which clearly proved that they stil looked up to Russia as the natural protector of their civil and religious liberties. Hls Eminence the Metropolitan read an address to M. Basily, the Russian Commissioner, in which it was said that the Wallachian clergy and people offered up their prayers to God for the Emperor Alexander, " the illustrious Protector of the orthodox faith." A deputation, at the head of which were Messrs. Charles and Constantine Crezoulesco, expressed in the name of the majority of the nation its fervent wishes for the happiness of the Emperor Alexander II., " who guaranteed and protected the rights and privileges of the Wallachians." M. Charles Crezoulesco terminated his speech by exclaiming, "Long live the Emperor Alexander II.," which cry was repeated by all the members of the deputation and by some other persons who were present. The Pera correspondent of the Triester Zeitung wrote, on the 3d inst., that two days previously Lord Stratford and Baron Prokesch had caled on Aali Pasha, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and had demanded "that the elections in Wallachia and Moldavia should be declared null and void." As soon as M. de Thouvenel heard of what had occurred he hurried to the palace of the Turkish Minister, and urged him to communicate to him what had passed between him5elf and the British and Austrian diplomatists. Aa]i Pasha replied that he was not at liberty to give the desired information, as the two ALmbassadors had addressed their note to the Turkish Cabinet. On reading the foregoing news in the Trieste paper, it appeared advisable to verify it before it was forwarded, but the only information which has been obtained on the subject is the following:-It is not officially known here that the British and Austrian Ambassadors have demanded the annulling of the Moldavian and Wallachian elections, but it is not doubted that they have furnished the Turkish Government with proofs that the elections were conducted in a most illegal manner. The German and Austrian papers maintain that the political refugees who returned to Bucharest and Jassy some months ago are completely " masters of the situation," and it would appearthat they speak bnt the truth, for almost all thne leaders of the so-called " emigration" have been elected. The Austrians are not sorry that the Democratic party has got the upper hand in the Principalities, as they foresee thit it will conduct itself in a manner which will not be to the taste of Rwusia. A few days since you were informed that the Porte had forwarded a circular on the subject of the Danubian Principalities to its diplomatic agents in foreign countries, and the news is confirmed by the Journal de Conista ntinopi of the 50th ult. The pith of the circular is, that no attention can be paid by the Porte to any wish which may be expressed by the Divan ad hoc for the union of Moldavia and Wallachia. Much is just now said and written about the Danish-Holstein question, but it hardly deserves the attention of the public; for Germany-taking the snail for her model-drew in her horns at the approach of danger. As long as Austria and Prussia could hope that the other great Powers would not interfere in the matter they used energetic and even menacing language towards Denmark, but since France, Russia, and England have declared that the question of the Duchies cannot be settled by Garmany alone, the Vienna and Berlin Cabinets have displayed great indecision. The news that the Danes themselves demand the re-establlshmentof the Constitution of 184.9 has given satisfaction to the German diplomatists, as they beheve that a compromise between Denmark and the Duchies may easily be effected if the so-called " Gesammt-Verfassung (General Constitution) is abrogated. Circumstances connected with the burial of Ideutenant-Colonel von E-, at Romerstadt, in Moravia, have created a great sensation. At 5 o'clock on the 5th inst. the body of the deceased was taken to the Catholic cemetery, and there buried, although he was a Protestant. The Imperial and municipal employgs, many invalid soldiers, the Gendarmerie, and a great crowd of people followed the remains of the officer, but no priest accompanied them, " because the deceased had neither gone to church regularly, nor had confessed at Easter." He had besides declined to receive the last consolations of religion at the hands of the Roman Catholic priest. As the clergy would not allow the bells to be tolled, a Dead March was playedasthecoffinwas conveyedthroughthestreeti of the town. The Protestant clergyman was not permitted to enter the churchyard, although the corpse was buried in that part of it which is set apart for persons who die in the Protestant faith. On Sunday last the so-caUed "Rosary Festival," the reform in the Dominican convent in this clty, began. A solemn mas was celebrated according to the Dominican or " Preacher" order. When the Gospel was read a flag was elevated before the altar, indicating that the servants of the Church are bound to do battle in her behalf. During the following night choral prayers were repeated from 12 till 1, and the bell was rang at midnight, to the great surprise of the persons reaiding in the neighbourhood of the ehurch~ The principal rule3 of the Order are, the strict obaervance of all the fast, and abstinence from all kinds o meat. Tee out of the 12 monks who were formerly in the convent have consented strictly to observe the rules of the Or-der, two have been secularized, and the other seven have been sent to Dominican convents in other parts of Austria, where they will be permitted to live as they had been accustomed to do here. Reforms Will not be insisted on in any of the other convents; but as those establishments which decline to make the required changes will not be permitted to take novices, the object of the Ultramontanists will eventually be attained. Hardly a day passes without some unfortunate speculator committing suicide here; and we have just learned that M Gozdanovich, a merchant at Neusatz? shot himself because he was unable to meet Ils engagements. His debts are said to amount to 500,000 florins (50,0001.) The morning papers state, on authority, that the Galician Railroad Company wiU be constituted this year, but the authority may perhaps be mistaken. Bore the company can be constituted 30 per cent. must be paid in, and it cannot possibly be the intention of the State to increase the difficulties under which the money-market is now labouring. Scores of little men have faUed lately, and the turn of some of the big ones will come if things long remain as they now are. The accident happened a few days since on the Southern Railroad because the telegraph clerk at Kapfenberg neglected to inform his colleague at the next station that a goods train was moving up the line down which the passenger train had to go. The railroad from Szolnok to Debreezin will be opened a the end of this month, as will also that part of the Pardubitz-Reelchenberg Railway which is between Pardubitz and the fortress of Josephstadt. It is stated that Prince Kallimachi has requested his Government to recall him, and hoped that the report may prove to be correct. The Turkish Amba3sador is both a man of ability and a good diplomatist, but he has never succeeded in acquiring the confidence of his colleagues. On the 6th of September a Russian sloop attacked a dozen sandales (boats of the country which are so called), laden with salt, manufactures, &c., which were lying off Touabs, on the coast of Circamsia. The 12 sandales were taken, and sent with Russian crews to Kertch. Eight other sandales, which were ly)g on the beach, were destroyed. Wecoicding to the Journal de Constantinople, which, however, Is a bad authority, there has been rising of the Razi-Komanks, whose civil and milltary Governor, the Russian General Aghalar Khan, was taken prisoner by SchamyL The Tarkish Government has announced that it has arrested, and intends to punish, certain " Primata" of the province of Widdin, and Youssouf Effendi, the Mudir of Beligradjik, for oppressing and squeezing money out of 20,000 inhabitants of the province in the name of the Imperial authorities.

I THE HEALTH OF LONDON. (From the Weekly Return of the Reglstrar.GeneraL) The total number of deaths registered in London in the week that ended on Saturday (October 10) is 993. In the ten years 1847.56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last woeek was 1.007; but, as the deaths of last week occurred in an increased population, it is neces sary, with a view to comparison, to raise the average in pro. portion to the increase, in which case it will become 1,108. The public health is therefore so far in a satisfactory state that the number of deaths Last week was less by about a hundred than would have occurred under the average rate of mortality as derived from the early part of October in former years. The excess of births over deaths is 375. Diarrhcea, which was so prominent during the mmmer, Is now reduced nearly within its ordinary limit, and, as com. pared with other diseases of the zymotio class, is third in the order of mortality. Typhus was fatal last week in 57 cases, scarLiatina in 52, diarrhcea in 41, whoopingeough in 26, measles in 21, croup In 13, dysentery in 12, smallpox in 3, cholera in L The single case of cholera occurred to a girl of 13 years at 3, Fisher's-alley, Spitalfields; the illness was of five days' duration, and terminated in consecutive fever. Four of the deaths from scar.a tina occurred in the district of Hamnpstead; of these, two at 16, New-end; four of those from measles occureod in the sub-district of Gray's-inn-lane. Cancer was fatal in 19 case; eight women died of disease incidental to chUldbear. ing; eight infants of inanition and want of breastmilk, A woman in Vandsworih was poisoned by mussels. The four persons whose deaths are returned for the week, and who stand highest in point of longevity, are all widows, two of whom had attained the age of 90 years, one 91 years, and the oldest is a centenarian, whose reputed age is 102 years. The death of the last occurred at 22, Red Lion-street, Clerken. well. Last week the births of 690 boys and 678 girls-in all 1,368 children-were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average numbor was 1,397. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-357 inches. The highest barometrical reading was 29-75 inchb3 at the begin. ning of the week; the instrument fell to 28-67 inches, Its lowest point, on Thursday. The mean temperaturo of the week was 507 deg., which is 1-6 deg. below the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily reading was below the average till Saturday. The highest temperature in the shade occurred on Wednesday, and was 63-4 deg.; the lowest was 41-9 deg. on Mon. day. The entire thermometrical range was therefore 21-5 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 47-9 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was only 2-8 deg. The wind was generally in the south-west on the first three days, and was very variable afterwards. There was rain on almost every day; the amount measured was 0,83 in., a great part of which fell on Wednesday and Thursday. According to an analysis which has been made by Dr. Robert Dundas Thomson, at St. Thomas's Hospital, the composition of the Southwark Company's water, taken from the stand pipe at the cab stand opposite the hospital, was in August 16 23 grs. of total impurity per gallon, of which 1 08 grs. were organio matter. On the 7thof September the total amount of impurity was 75-56 grs. per gallon, and of this 5-66 grs. were organic matter. This water In September, 1857, was as impure as the dirty water which was supPlied to the inhabitants of London In former years, when theTwater was taken from the Thames at Vauxhall.
THE BERKELEY PEERAGE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the able sketch you gave of tho Berkeley poerage there is an inaccuracy which, when you consider the enormous circulation of your paper, and that Tm T'im'j is quoted as authority In most matters of dispute, I trust you will permit me to sel right. When tho late Earl FitNhardinge claimed the earldom of Berk-oley the House of Lords decided that his claim was not proven, but no deocision whatever took placo as to tho claims of any other person, and consequently the House of Lords did not decide that the peerage belonged to Thomas Moreton Fitzhardinge Berkeley. It is true, as you correctly state, that the late William Fitzhardinge Berkeley wan the eldest son of the fnrst marrlage, and Thomas hMoreton F. Berkeley the eldest son of the second marriage; equally true that the House of Lords docided that the first marriage was not proven; but that in no way gives the earldom of Berkeley, except by presumption, to any individual ; and Sir Maurice Berkeley, if he believe the case of the late Wiliam Fitzhardinge failed from fault of conducting it, or conceive that he has fresh evidence of the first marriage, has a perfcot locus standi to make a claim; and if Thomas AMoreton F. Berkley, on the other hand, brought forward a claim, Sir Maurice Berkeley might oppose It. There is one other point In which you havo made a alighl inaccuracy;-the whole of the Berkeley estates, with no exception, devolve on Sir Maurico Borkeley up to the present moment. Thomas Moreton F. Berkeley has de. clined making aoy claim to the earldora from the full conviction of the legitimacy of his elder brothers. I am, Sir, yours obedientlv. A GLOUCESTERHIRE MAN.

TjB ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-G.NERAL OF TIM ARMY TO THE SECRLTARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF LNDIA Delhi, June 13. Sir,-In continuation of letter of the 27th ult, to your address, from the late Adjutant-General of the Army, reporting the death of the Commander-tn.Chief on that day, I am PVow desired by Major- GeneralT. Reed, C.B., commandlng the forces in Bengal, to request that you 'will inform the Governor-General in Council that the Major.General having left Rawul Pindee on the 28th ult., reached the camp of the force under Major-General Sir EH Barsard, K. C. B., at Alleepore, one march from Delhi, about 1 am. of the 8th inst,, 'when the troops were on tho point of moving to drlve in the posts of the mutineers outside Delhi. 2. Sir H. Barnard had been joined on the previous day by Brigadier A. Wilson with troops from Meerut, and on the 6th inst. by the siege train with its escort, so that the total force in camp was as enumerated in the margin.* 3. I beg to enolose copies of the Major-General's two reports of the successful operations of this day, and am only to add that Major-General Reed entirely approves of the whole of the dispositions made, and cordialy concurs in the approbation bestowed on the officers and troops engaged, and particalarly on those who are more especially mentioned. 4. The Commander of the Forces, I am to state, was unable, from severe siokness and fatigue, to accompany the troops, and in no way interfered with the arrangements of Sir H. Barnard, who was attended in the field by the headquarters' Staff. 5. Major-General Reed desires to express his deep regret at the loss of the Adjutant-General of the Army, Colonel C. Chester, who was kiUed by a cannon shot in the first advance on the enemy's heavy battery at Badulee Ke-SeraL The loss of this officer at the present juncture is deeply deplored by the Commander of the Forces. 6. Since the arrival of the troops at Delhi several affairs have taken place, In all of which the troops engaged have greatly distinguished themselves. The moet important of these occurred yesterday morning, when our position'was attacked in great force, and the enemy completely repulsed with much loss Sir H Barnard's report of this action is enclosed. 7. The Guide Corps, under Captain Daly, arrived on the morning of the 9th inst., having marched from Murdan, in Eusufzaie, a distance of 580 miles, in 22 days. 8. The Engineer and Artillery portions of the forco have been actively employed in throwing up batteries, and in maintaining a fire on the city. The rnutineers have mounted a very formidable artiUery, and their practice is excellent and usually well sustained; but the Major-General trsts ere long we shall be enabled to strike a decisive blow at the plac. 9 In addition to the enclosures already referred to I am directed to attach copies of Brigadier Wilson's reports of his two actions at Ghazee-od-deen Nuggur. I have, &c., W. A. NORMAN, Lieutenant, No. 2. BaIGADIER WILSON TO THz ADJUTANT-GENRAL or THE ARMY. Ghazee-od-deen Nuggur, May 31. Sir,-I have the honour to report, for the information of Major-General Sir E. Barnard, E C.Bt, commanding the Umballa force, that, as reported lnmy brief despatch of last night, my advanced pckets 'were driven in at about 4 o'lockyesterday afternoon, and that I'was attacked by a large force of mutineers, accompanied by heavy guns, from I immediately sent off a company of Her MajSesty's 60th Royal Rilies, with another in support, to hold the iron bridge, 'which is the key of my position, and I detached the four guns of Major Tombs's troop, supported by a suadron of Carabineers rightalong the bank of the Hindan The insurgents opened upon these advanced parties with heavy guns. I ordered two more companies of the 60th to support theiradvance, and brought up four guns of dajor Scott's battery, the Sappers, and a troop of Carabineers to their support, leaving two guns and a troop of Carabineers to protect the camp. The first few rounds from t-he insurgentac guns 'were ad nirably aimed, plungeng through our camp; but they 'were ably replied to by our two 18-pounders, in potstion under Lieutenant Light and Major Toebs's troop, most admirably led by Lieutenant-Colone te macketzie, who, raking them in flank with his 6-pouders, first made their fire unsteadiy, and ln a short time silenced these heavy guns. On remarking the uediness of theirfire ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Jones to advance his Rifles gad attck This was done in a most spirited manner, They drove the enemy from the guns; but in the act of taking possession of two heavy pieces on the causeway, close to the toll house, I regret to y that Captain Andrews and four of his men 'were hlown up by the explosion of aun adnnhiton uaggon, fired by one of the mutineersa Tihe insurgents were now in full retreat, leaving in our bands ordnance on, and store as6 detailed in the accompanying statement. They 'were folloved for a con- iderable distance on the Dedhi road by LeutenantColooed Custance, commanding the Carabineers with the fore. Where all behaved so 'well and showed such galant conduct it is almost invidious to partioularize, but I irsh to bring to Major-Genera Sir HL Barnard's notice, nd through him to the Commander of the Forces, LieutenanteColonel MIackenzie, 1st Brigade Horse Atllery, 'who so ably led; Mhjor Tombs, who so gallmntly fought the 2d troop of tha brigasde (the latter hbd his horse shot under hem); Lieutenant-Colonel Cnstance, commanding the Carabineers Lieutenant-Colonel Jones, 'who so gallantly led the 60th Royal Riles, and Major Scott, who ably supported that regiment. 1fbeg to enclose the reports I have received from officers commanding detachments, with a return of kiled and wounded, and of the oaptured ordnance and ammunitionI Mr. Greathed, the Commissioner attended on me during tie wholeof the action. From tihis gentleman and four of my owvn personal staff-Captain Johnson, Staff Officer of the Force; Captain O'Eamilton, offIciating DeputyAssistant Quartermaster-Genetal; Captain Rusell, of the 54th; and Lieutenant Barchard, of the 20th Native Infantry; my orderly officers, and Lieutenant Waterfield, of the Comissariat lBepartment-I received every ssistnce. The casualties may not he considered great under the advantages we have gained; but with my small force I cannot afford to lose men. I have auplied to MIajor-General Hlewitt, commanding Meer.t Division, for a reinforcement, as I consider my present force much too small for the position I am placed In-liable to constant attacks from DelBo Partes of horse have been seen from that quarter reconnolitring my position all the morning, and it is very harassing to the men to be kept so constntly on the alert, I have, &co, A.

Sir,-In continuation of my demi offcial express of last night's data I have the honour to report, for the information of Major-General Sir H. Bairnard, K.C.B., and, through him, of the Commander of the Forces, that the insurgents attacked me again yesterday afternoon, at about 1 o'clock, in force. They took up a position extending fuUy a mile on the high n the opposite side of the Hindun, about a frommy advanced pickt, in front of the bnidge, and commenced a fire wilth their guns from this long distance. The guns of the Horse Artillery, supported by a squadron of Csrsbineers, immediately moved forward to reply to the ^ 4 guns, 2d tcoop, lst byigado 2d and 3d tr;ops, 3d ragMe, Hor'e Artillery; 3d comPany, 31 batWflon.

The Rifle3, leavnn one company in camp, movei forward to the sup. port of the picket at the bridge, suppnrted bj two guns of Major Scott s battery and a troop of Carabineers. Perceiving that the Horse Artllery wereexposed toa very heavy fire, I advanced two more guns of Major Scott's bittory, under Lieutenant Davidson, to support them. For nearly two hours the action was one of artillery chiefly. The Rifles clearing the vilage on the left of the toll-6ar, and the fire of the enemy's guns slackening, I ordered a general advance, the insurgents retiring, continuing their fire untU we drove them from their position and crowned the ridge, from which we could see them in full retreat to Delhi, My men were so knocked up by the heat of the sun,;b which many officers and men were struck down, thtI could not follow them further, as I wished. I therefore withdrew the force Into camp, after having first burnt a vilage on our right flank, from which the insurgents had given us much annoyance. All the force performed their duty wleU and to my satisfaction; and in addition to those officers whom I brought to notice in my despatch of yesterday, detailing the action of the 30th, I wish to report favourab& of Lieutenant Eliot, of Artillery, who supported the Ri lez with two guns of Major Scott's battery, in the most steady and determined manner; Lieutenant Light also did admirable service with his iS-poundors. The Sappers and Miners under Lieutenant Maunsell, whom I brought up in support of Lieutenant Elliot's guns, performed most efficient service. I have to regret the loss of Lieutenant Perkins, of Horse Artillery, an invaluable officer, and a great loss to me. I beg to enclose reports from the commanding officers, and a return of klled and wounded. I regret to say that the insmrgents were enabled to carry off all their guns, which appeared to me to consist of two heavy pieces, on the Delhi-road, ad fve light guns, most probably the remains of Captain de Teissier's batter; one of their amumunition wraggons only was destroyed.

Sir,-I have the honour to report, for the information of bis Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, that I arrived here on the 3d inst. with a detachment of the regiment under my command (lst Madras Fusileers), and found 60 of my men and three officers, who had preceded me here. A company of men were about two days in rear, and three more were foUowing up by bullock-train. I had arrangedtostrt with a detachment of the regiment for Cawnpore on the afternoon of the 4th, but on that afternoon intelligence was received from Lieutenant PaUiser, in command of a detachment of 50 Sowars of the 13th Irregular Cavalry, sent out to escort treare from Azimghur to this that the 17th Regiment had broken out into open mutiny, and, joined by the city people and gaol prisoners, had left the station and attacked hi. paty, and captured the treasure, his infantry escort acting with them. on this intelligence reaching Benares Brigadier Ponsonby consulted with me about taking the muskets from the 37th, leaving them their side arms. He proposed waiting ut the following morning to do this. I urged th being done at once, to which he agreed, and left my quarters to make his arrangements, directing me to be present with the Europeans, as per mar. gin,*at pm. The Sikh- Regiment, in which Lientenant-ColonelGordon placed nuch confidence, and a party of about 70 of the 13th Irregular Cavalry, who were despatched, were to join the Europeans in their demonstration. Brigadier Ponsonby came on parade at the hour appointed, but I observed that he appeared far from well, and perfectly unable to act with energy or the vigoum required on the emergency. We moved up the Europeans and guns towards the 37th, the Sikhs advancing upon the other flank of that corps, followed by Irregalar Cavalry. On approaohling the belis of arms of the 37th the Sepoys of that corps selzed their arms, loaded them, and opened fire upon us, which was Immediately returned with conidaerable execution by the Artillery and Europeans, the Sikh Regiment not having yet come up. At this time several of our men fell wounded, and the Brigadier was on his back on the ground, seemingly struck by a stroke of the sun, and declared himself quite unfit for anything, and begged that, being the next senior officer, I would at once assume the commandI which I accordingly did, and directed a dash on the lines with the Europeans and Sikhs in line on each flank of the Artilery. I ws on the right of our men in the lines when an alarm was given, and I found the Sikhs had suddenly halted, wavered, and eventually gone about and dispersed, having first, however, fired at and tried to shoot their commanding officer and adjutant, and fi-ed upon and wounded several other officers, and fired upon the squadron of Irregular Cavalry drawn up in rear of them. 2. I believe, from all I have observed and been told, that, with a few exceptions, the Seikhs were supposed to be quite stanch; they seemaed in the greatest spirits, and anxious to be led against the 37th. The cause of their sudden panic and extraordinary conduct Is supposed to have been the turmoil caused in their rear by a Sowar of the 13th Irregalar Cavalry having fired at and attempted to cut down the Brigade-Major, Captain Dodgson, on his riding up to assume command of them by the Brigadier's order, their own commanding officer having been killed before reaching parade by the men of the 37th Native Infantry. On hearing the shot and shouts the Sikhs turned round and fired on their officers and onr men; one man who had fired at Colonel Gordon was immediately shot by one of his Havnldars. 3. The Artillery, on observing the disaffection of the Sikhs, opened upon them with considerable effect; they broke and ran, as did the Irregular Cavalry. After this I completed the expulsion of the 37th Regiment from their lines, and burnt them, and withdrew mny men and guns into position in the barrack, securing myself for the night. 4. Early noxt morning I sent out parties and brought in the arms, accoutrements, and colours of the 3,7th that had been left in their lines, as also some of the Sikhs. I alsolarranged with the civil authorities to remove the treasare from its most insecure and unmilitary position in the civil lines, and detached a party, consisting of 100 men of Her Majesty's 10th and Madras Fusileers, and 25 Sovwars, Irregular Cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon, and had it all brought up and secured in the barracks. 5. On my arriving here I had observed and expressed my opinion on the inseourity of this treasure, undor charge only of a native guard of Sikbs, who, however, stood firm and deserve the greatest credit for their loyal conduct. I consider the peril in which this treasure has been placed has been for some time imminent; and I feel assured that had the steps taken against the 37th been deferred until the following morning the outbreak would have taken place that night when unprepared, and no efficient assistance could have been rendered by the troops to the European families in cantonments, who would have been left to the mercy of the miscreants lot loose on such an occasion. I hada party of Madras Fusileers at a building called the Mint, and arrangod with the Brigadier, before going on parade, that should any disturbance occur al the families should go there for protection. This was carried out, the party of Europeans there giving conflidence and acting as a check to plunderersthe mutineers, who broke and fled, deserted canton' ments rapidly, many of them throwing away their arms. I now hold the barraoks and Mint-house between cantonments ana orty with my Europeans, and have some nXtive gnard of trustworthy men as pickets in different parts of canton. ments, and feel the cantonments are all safe ; and when a few more European troops come up I intend planting a picket at the church, when all the houmes in cantonme, ts may, I consider, with safety be again occupied. About 9.i of the Irregular Cavalry remained faithful, and are nodoing duty, patrolling and keeping off the "Budmashes" from the city from entering cantonments. About 190 of the Sikh Regiment, who wero on treaure and other guards, are still with us, and remain faithfuL A few of them I have promoted for their good conduct when the regiment broke and fled. A further report will be made ou this sub- ject, as well as regarding some men of the Irregl ir CAivalry I have also promoted for loyalty and good conduct. I beg to state that we have lost several officers and soldiers on this unfortunate occason, as follows :- Xilled.-Captain Guise, commanding Irregular Cavalrv, murdered by 37th men; one apothecary, Her HaJesty's 10th, ditto; two men, Her Majesty's 10th, shot on parade. Wounded.-Shot on Parade.-Ensign Chapman, 37th Regin ent, Native Infantry, dangerously; Ensien Ilayter, 2Mt Native Infantry, doing duty, 37th, dangerously; Ensign Tsveedie, 4th Native Infantry, doing duty, 37th, severely; si,cht privates. Hler Mtajesty's lOi; Quarter. master-Sergeant Maidman, '2th Native Infantry, doing duty wvith Sikh Regiment, severely. All ranks behaved as British soldiers; the hard work and exposure to the sun were most cheerfully borne. I beg to bring to notice particularly the assistance I have received from Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon, commanding the Sikhs Lieutenant-Colonel Spottiswoode, 37th ; the Brigade-hajor, Captain Dodgson, Captain Olpherts, commanding the ArtWery; and Lieutenant Goseing, Adjutant, Madras Fusileers.

THE INDIAN MUTINIES. MEERIT. The following extract from a letter just received from a private in the 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabineers) will be found interesting:- " Meerut Cantonments, Aug. 4. "My dear Parents,-I received your packet of letters on the 31st ult., and assure you they were very acceptable after the long Interval between your last two budgets. [Letters were written to him every month, so that some of them could not have reached their destination.] Since I wrote to you in June things have been going on much the same out here. We have a number of ours before Delhi; in fact, there is quite an army there now, but they are waiting for further reinforcements to take the place. We hear of engagements every day, but are pretty quiet here at present, with the exception of a few shots occasionally fired at our sentries. Directly a number of the beautiful creatures (Sepoys) assem. ble anywhere the spies bring us information, and a detachment Ls sent out to attack them, always 'with the same result -namely, their total defeat. The other day a detachment from our troop attacked a party 20 or 30 miles out, routed them, and took a number of guns-and how, and of what, do you think they were made? Why, I will toll you. You may, perhaps, have seen the iron socket of a tefegraph post, by which it is fixed into the ground; of course it is holow. and a touchhole is easUy made at the smallesb end of it, So far, so good-there is your gun. Now for the carriage, &c.; they cut up the wooden posts, and for the ammunition they cut up the telegraphic wires into small rough pieces, tied up in an old sock or something of that kind, just like grapashot. Not such a bad get-up for a set of niggers ! We are surrounded by trenches, batteries, bastions, &e., and they are now nearly full of water, as the monsoons are at their height. Our duty is one day and night on and one off, sometimes by chance two; and when off the recruits have to go to the riding school, and then to clean their traps ready for another 24 hours' duty. I am now very well, thank God, and have done duty for two months. The cholera has been prevalent among the troops at Delhi and taken off a number of our men, besides the loss in kiUled and wounded every day. Ask some one to explain the ' prickly heat to you, for we all have it. When the cold weather comes I expect we shaU make a move, but your letters will find me If directed to Meerut. You need not be at all anxious about me, for the black felow is not yet born that Is to kIll me, Remember me to the baby. God bless you all."
STATR OF TRADE. 1ANCHESTER, OCT. 13. There has been quite a pause In business, sellers showing a disposition quite as strong as that of buyers to watch the course of commercial events around them before further extending operations. The further rise in discounts would alone have affected the market very seriously, but the reports of failures In Glasgow, some of which affect houses in this city connected with them and in America, are still greater obstacles to business, by affecting credit. It is reported here that a good deal of the loss by the Glasgow houses will fall on the Western Bank of Scotland, a small portion only of it failing on the public. Quotations are nominally the same as last week in yarn, but in some quarters business is reported at rather easier rates. In both cloth and yarn, how. ever, the offers have scarcely been sufficienttotest prices. For India goods there is naturally a disposition to hold back orders until the letters by the Overland Mail are to band. The stoppage of a Scotch shawl house and a Bradford house in this city, the latter with debts amounting to 40,0001, have been mentioned during the last few days. Messrs. Jobn Slagg and Co. report :_ There is little or uothiug doing in soods t,-day.

There has been less than an average amount of business done In the cloth-halls this morning. The advance in the rate of discount by the Bank of England, counled with other unfavourable features in monetary affairf, indaces great caution on the part of merchants, who offered lower prices in many instances for cloth this maorDing. As the great bulk of the manufactiirers, however, are able to keep their present stocks rather than sell them at a sacrifice, and it is believed that the present depression will only be temporary, the reduction demanded by Lbyers was but in few Instances acceded to. The goods sold were chiefly small parcels of the commoner and heavy cloths and mlxtures. Adverting again to monetary matters, it may be asserted that confidence Is felt in the general stabllity of the woollen houses, both merohants and manufacturers, in this town and neighbourbood, and there is no faiure ramoured or expected. There has been a failure in the Bradford (worsted) trade, bub it will affect few, if any, houses in Leeds. Mr. Hugh Fergusson, stuff merchant, Manchester and Bradford, has failed. His creditors are called together by circular the meeting to be held on Friday next at Man. chester. Hs liabilities are reported to be a little more than 40,0004 The assets have not been mentioned. The Leeds Meercury, which mentions this failure to-day, says that is stated that Mr. Fergusson has been engaged to a considerable extent in speculative transactions. HLTDDERSFIELD, OCT. 13. There has been a quiet mnarket to-day, and only a small a-mount of cloth, trouserings, and waistcoatiDgs have been sold. Tippet grays and Bedford cords have been in most request. Grest caution Is used on all hands, and purchases are generally smalL Wool remains very firm. jAdvertisement.]-" The Law of Landlord and Tenant," pr,eIs.,byW.

MR. PBASE, M.P., ON INDIA. An Influential meeting was hold at Darlington on Monday, 1 In pursuance of a requiaition to the chief bailiff to concert , messures for assisting the sufferers by the Indian mutiny. J Mr. F. Mewburn, jun., presilded, and the meeting incladed Ii. IL H. Allan, a near relative of General Elavelock, toetbher with gentlemen of all creeds. nlr. H. Prz, XP., moved as the first resolutlon,- " That thi, meetlng of the lnhabltant3 of DArlington and its neighbourhood exPresee the deepest sYmpathy In the safferinga of their fellow oountrymen and oonntrywomen In Ind"a and detestatioa of the revolting ad babaroubs outrages of which they have been the victims." He was sure that the meeting had become too painfully acquainted with the circumstances which had brought gentlemen together to render it necessary for him to dwell on scenes which could only harrow up their deepest feelings of indignation and of sorrow, and which were of an atrocity almost unheard-of in history. (Hear, hear.) They had met there to prove that they felt a sympathizing sorrow and a desire as far as Dossible to mitigate the distress of those who had been the victims of to dire a state of things In India. When the English public was really aroused by sorrow and distress, it or e most part only neededthatthe channelthrough which assistance might be rendered should be made known and be such as confidence coald be placed in ; and, so long as this matter of dispensing the bounty of the nation was committed to the care of gentlemen in London such as seemed certain fairly to meet the cases to be assisted, he had no doubt the confidence of the English public was unlimited; but, If it shonld hereafter be resolved upon to place the money raised by subscription in the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he took it that that eonfidence would be greatly mitiatod. (Applause.) He did not ay this as in thsli ghtest eagree reflecting on the Chancellor himself-a gentleman whom he apprehended they all respected in his position; but he thought they would agree in this-that, when money was raised by the British public for the purpose of promoting and assisting any benevolent object, itwas always mnch more certain to be brought directly to its destination if transmitted through channels having a feeling in unison with that of the senderg, than if dispensed according to the rules of Government officials, and through channels ordained as a mere matter of Government policy. (Hear, hear.) In moving a resolution, with the contents of which he thoroughly agreed, though strongly tempted to animadvert upon the past, he would only exprees his opinion that the time could not be far distant when the Brit,tsh public would no longer submit to have so fair and vast a region governed as India had been, in such a manner as to implicate our character, whether as Statesmen, as mer. chants, asphilanthropists, or as Christians. That subject must at no distant da, come before Parliament in all its length andbreadth, anl.he feltdeeplyanxiousthattheBritish public should assert their right to have the subject so considered as ihat we should not again hear of famines and other horrors, but of a country governed as It should be while under British rule-prosperous in its mercantile relations, and its rulers having an eye to the rpreading of that relgion which could alone effectua bless that vast region. (Applause.) The ev. J. G. PFAnSor seconded the resolution. He congratulated the county of Durham on having been privileged to send forth a man (General Havelock whom God seemed to have appointed as the champion of the distressed a man who was not only admired as a general, but whose character as a Christian stood above reproach. (Ap plause.) We ,night be sure that not only would our aoldiers be led to victory by the brave and gallant Havelock, but that victory In his hands would not be disgraced by outr7-ges or our soldiers imitate the atrocities of those against whom they fought. (Hear, hear.) Let not this admiration, or the sympathy which all would readily express, be that of the p only, for our soldiers would fight better and mere nobly if they felt ssured that the nation would care for those whom they held most dear. (Applause.) The resolution was carried nem con. Mr. H. E. SPAid moved,- " That tn order to make the meetines expresson of symipthy materIal. each Individual In the town and nelahbourhood should do his or her utmost to raise a stLbudption for relievng the wanta of the be. eaved, and for stimulating our brave soldiers by the asurance of sympathy at hone." The Rev. R. J. SIMPSON seconded the motion, which, together with others of a formal nature, was passed unanimously. Mr. JoSgpn PESE (late MP.), in moving a vote of tbanks to the chairman, spoke at some length on Indian affairs. As an Englishman, he took shame to himself for the way in which we had abused our power over 150,000,000 of human beings. It had been his lot to sit for many years in the House of Commons, and say he felt shame as an Englishman that while the smallest and most trivial personal dispute would bring houses of from 300 to 500 members, and while senators would sit patiently to hear the cavillings and personal piques and preoudices of individuals Lord Glenelg and others whom he had humself assistei found it the most difficult thing in the world to keep 40 members together on a subject affecting the interests of millions. But the time was coming when England would say to her representatives and her Government that if she was to have the shame and disgrace of misrule she would at any rate inquire into the cause. (Applause.) He most sincerely hoped no gentleman would pass from that meeting under the impression that he had only to relieve his distressed fellow-countrymen, and to say to the men whose profession it was to brave death in every possible shape, " We pity and sympathize with you." No, that was not the end. (Hear, hear.) The agriculture of India ought long ago to have made us independent of that cotton supply with which the United States vauntingly flouted us in the face when we spoke against her abominable traffic In human flesh and blocd, and of the sugar supply from all the slave-labour in the world. But Indian agricu. tore had been shamefully overlooked. In relious matters it had been worse, and the state of things was such as no Government could long maintain provided a Christian people knew how to do its duty. He had no desire to coerce, but if the native Indian wanted to burn widows or murder children in the name of religion he would certainly prevent him. (Applause.) And then as to our general policy. The telegraphad just brought him the news that the Bank of England would henceforth exact 7 per cent, from our manufacturers and traders, and this was another r ermit of misrule in India. A blue-book informed him i that 1,000 millions sterling had been drawn from India without any retuLin on earth that he could ascertain, and it was still true, he feared, that if our rule terminated tomorrow, there would be no monument of that rule remaining which could turn to our credit. India wasuniversally pointed at as a proof of our incapacity to govern; but let not the widow and orphan suffer for that. (Applause.) A subscription was commenced in the room. The venerable Edward Pease (father of railways) sent a donation of lo5. in a letter in which he requested Its application to the relief of the widows and orphans of civilans. He sympathized with those belonging to the military rank, but in choosing their profession they knew what was before them, and he could not in any way countenance an employment forbidden by the Saviour. Aler the reading of this letter the meeting broke up.
.CITY COMMISSION OF SBWERS. Yesterday a Court, at which Mr. Deputy CIIRISTE presided, was held for the despatch of public business. SANITARY STATE OF T}IE CITY. The following are extracts from the report of the Medical Officer of Health - ,.The mortality returns indicate a satisfactory state of the public health. There were 55 deaths in the dty during the week, which is a little below the average number for the season; 23, or nearly Ihalf of these deaths, ocourred among children of less than five years of age. There were but two deaths from diarrhcea and dysentery. There were two deaths from fever and two from scarlet fever. II In respect of the letter from Mr. Wood, of 15, Bow-lane, complaining that Messrs. Bell ard Black are sti3l in the babit of storing lucifer matches in large quantities upon their premises and of not keeping them in a fireproof room, I beg to report that I have this day visited the premises, and find that Messrs. Bell and Black have fuo3y per. forned the promise which they made at the time of my formcer visit, and have removed all their stock from their premises except the small quantity which is necessary for counter trade, and that this quantity is kept in a fireproof room.
TihE NEsz VALEY DRAINAGE.-Some alarm is felt at the present critical position of the Nene Valey Drainage Works at Wisbech, and Mr. R. Stephenson has been requested to deliver a special report upon the sub. aet. That gentleman has accordingly addressed to Mr. E. Jackson, of Wisbech, some extremely Important observations. He says:-" I think it essential to make a suggestion as to what. should be Immediately done to avert disasters which may at any period during this season of the year overwhelm the adjacent lands. The proper spirit in which this question should be approac,ed by all parties affected should be, merging all Nene Valley Drainage questions and the conflicting interests Incidental thereto, to view it rather as if a great calamity were imminent, against the consequences of which all parties should most strenuously combine to provide a remedy. . . . The two main sources of danger are of course-first, the land floods ; secondly, excessively high sea tides. . . . In my opinion, the proper course would be to construct at or near the proposed bridge at Wisbeoh a strong substantial wooden stanch, with two self-acting tidal gates opening seawards, with an aggregate waterway of 50 feet, aud provided with slackers of sufficient dimensions to admit tidal waters. The effect of this will be to restrict at pleasure the flow of the tidal waters at Wisbech. The dams might then be removed, and the passage for the land floeds to sea left free, while the banks above Wisbech would bh effectuaUy secured from the effects of high tides. . . . The firstcost of a stanoh of this description cannot be safely estimated at less than 3,0001." A specil4 meeting of the oommissioners is to be immediately caUed to take Mr. Stephenson's report into consideration. fAdvertisement.]-North-Westeru Provinces.-With the Dispatch" of Sunday next, October 18, wil be presented, gratis, a beanuliully aoloured map of the North-Western Fiorines of India, oeotainlng Delbi, Oude.

There are practi- Mr. C LEY applied on his behalf for a eortifioate, and attributed the failure in some degree to the restoration of peace and the fall of prices.

E&. LuctS opposed. The course pursued by the bankrupt was one most prejudicial to society-that of extorting money by means of eertain proceedings. Mr. BAJuiow, for the bankrupt, said he had become speechles& Mr. LIJCA.-In that case it would be almost an act of cruelty to remove him. Mr. BARnow.-It would be greater ermelty to retain him in prison in a miserable room where a murder was lately Committed. After some further evidence, including a statement of the governor of the prison that the bankrupt ws so ill that his removal would be attended with danger, Mr. Lucas consented to the bankrupts release, and his discharge was ordered.

POLICE. MANSION-1OUSIL-DaNnel I"rar,s brought before Alderman SALomps upon the c a of havingfraudulently embezzled the sum of lIU. 15s., the property of Mr Daniel tante, tdlor, of Trinity-square, Tower-Will Commiaifteo for triaL A miserable creature named Sarah Hill, the wife of a respectable tradesman,was brought up, charzed with having used threatening and obscene language to the master of one of the workbouses. She was also charged with having attempted to strngle herself with a piece of rope in the stationhoure. The husband of the defendant had, it appeared, treated her with the greatest kindness, and, findingit impossible to live with her on acount of her Insatiable thirst for strong liquors, made her an adequate allowance for her nainte. nance, and furnished apartments for her upoa three several occaions To supply herselt with gin she had sold all the furniture, and she had, in the course of her drunken adven. tures, been frequently lodged In the stationhouse, in which sh was, it was sai, as well known as the nightly in. spector. Alderman SALOMONs, who was evidently shocked at hearing the statement, directed that the unfortunate woman should be taken to the Holloway Prison and be examined there as to the stats of her mind. The defendant said, "it was all because" she had a little drop too much. Bow-s=rs.-Mr. Holder, late Captain and Paymaster of the 5th Lancashire Miltia, was again brought before Mr. JARDWE on the charge of misapplying a sum of public money-viz., the balance of 1,153f. lOs., due from him at the expirtion of his service. Mr. VOD= opened the case by informing his worship that the defendant became paymaster of the above regiment In January, 1855, and held the office till the same month in 1856. His lat quarter's account showed a balance of 1,153C lOs. against him, and on the 27th of March he wrote to the War Department to the effect that this arose in consequence of his having in the estimate for the quarter included some 200 men who had volunteered into the line, but whose names he had for two months omitted to " deduct" from the list. He added that he would pay the balance to the public account in the Bank of Eugand, but this had never been done. There were other sums alleged to have been misappropriated, including one of 2541., made up of items of one quarter, received on account of some of the men towards their clothing, but these would not be gone into at present. Evidence having been given of the above facts. Mr. Grey, the defendant's counsel, contended that the case did not come within tho meaning of the Act. The defendant had an account with the Government-there was a balance, and he had not paid it-that was alL hfr. JA.tDME said that question must be argued elsewhere. In his opinion the case clearly came within the Act, and he should send the defendant for triaL It is a curious circumstance that Mr. Holder, in 1855, brought an action against a lady for breach of promise of marriage, aud obtained 300. damages. Mr. JARD= gave judgment on the six summons against printaellers in Holywell-street, whose books, prints, &c., were recently seized. In two cases only the defendants appeared, and attempted by counsel to show that their books, &c., did not come within the meaning of the Act, the learned gentleman ruotlng a definition of "obscenity " from Cicero, De Mr. JARDINE decided that the works were obscene and ordered their destruction, subject to a delay of seven days, in case of appeal, or in case Government should decide upon indicting the parties. In the four remaining cases the same order was made in regard to the greater proportion of the artiles, a few being excoepted on the ground that they were not sufficiently indecent to come within the meaning of this Act, not being such as would be subject to indictment. Among those excepted were some copies of the paper called Paut Pry. The books, &c., excepted were ordered to be returned to the parties, who, however, were not in attendance to claim them. MARYyiNoNO -George Allen and Thomas Smith, young men of determined appearance, were placed at the bar before Mr. BROUG}1TON, charged with having burglariously entered the house of Mr. Green, 27, Albert-street, Hampstead-road, and stolen property of different descriptions belonging to him (Mr. Green) and two gentlemen who occupied apart. ments at his residence. Mr. BROUGHTOT remanded the prisoners, who were advised by their solicitor, Mr. Keane, not to say anything at present, till Tuesday next. WEsFwsTER.-A few days ago a very interesting looking girl, only 17 years of age, who gave her name Lydia Stanley, was charged at this court under very peculiar circamstances. She hadbeen taken into custody for being disorderly in the street, and while at the pollce-station had a number of fits, and medical aid was procured for her. On her recovering slightly she requested permission to walk in the yard, and while there made a determined attempt to strangle herself, which she subsequently avowed her intention of repeating whenever opportunity presented itself. E deavours were used to ascertain the abode of her friends, but she declined to give any information upon the subject, alleging, however, in the most solemn manner that her own father had been her seducer. Mr. PAYNYTR took much interest in the poor girl's case, which also attracted the sympathy ot Miss Bardett Coutts; and while the unfortunate object of her solicitude was under remand arrangements were made for her reception into that lady's reformatory establishment at Notting-hill. The girl was brought up yesterday from the prison, and on Mr. PAiYiTER informing her that she was now discharged and would be taken to the asylum in quxestion, where he hoped she would properly estimate the advantages that would be conferred upon her, she expressed her sincere gratitude for the kind exertions which had been made in her behalf, and then left the court with one of the female warders of the House of Detention for Notting-hilL WORSRnP-STREET.-Robert Baker, 45, night watchman at Shoreditch Workhouse, was charged as follows:- Eliza Winterflood, a pretty and intelligent child less than 12 years of age, and daughter of a carrier in Bishopsgate, stated that at 6 o'clock on the preceding evening her mother sent her and her sisters out upon an errand, when, while passing an apple-stll, she took one of the apples, and afterwards feeling it was wrong to do so got frightened, ran away from her sisters, was afraid to go home, and wandered about till she was met bya constable, who took her to the workhouse, where he delivered her into the care of the prisoner, and left. Directly he had done so the prisoner took her by the hand, and, leading her into a dark hole by the side of the gate, stripped off part of her clothing, and assaulted her in too infamous and indecent a manner to be further alluded to. She screamed out and resisted as well as she could, but he terrified her by threatening to Slog her if she made a noise, and having then led her out of this dark place and handed her over to one of the nurses sbe explained where her parents lived, and an elderly man was sent with her to take her home. Sarah Winterflood, the child's stepmother, deposed to meeting her while being brought back, and that on questioning her as to the cause of her absence she related to her the particulars of the illusage to which she had been subjected. An examination of the child afforded ample proof that she had been assaulted in a most abominable manner, and she therefore complained to the police, one of whom took her and the child to the workhouse, the authorities of which ordered an immediate investigation; and six or seven men having been brought out and placed together before herthe child unhesitatingly selected the prisoner from among them, and he made no denial. The child had two frocks on when she left home, but had only one when she was brought back. Goddard, an officer, corroborated the mother's evidence, but said that on chargingthbe prisoner with this offence he denied all knowledge of it further than admiitting the little girl at a very late hour, but that he had nob taken her to any dark hole, as she had stated. The child herself, how. ever, took them to a small dark waiting-room adjoining the gateway, which was without llght and answered her descrptin, nd n te lttl gil rpeaingto himi that he had taken off part of her clothing he maade no reply. The prisoner did not speak a word from the first to the last of the examination, and was committed for the completione of the evidence. CLERRENWELL.-Thomas Chobby, a ed 29, a tal, powerfulloohng felow a sub-warder in the gtouse of Correction, residing at lo, Mountpleaant, St. Andrew's, Holborn, was placed at the bar before Mr. TYRRWITT, oharged with violently assaulting and biting Police-constables Robert Gould, 466 N, Benjamin Hill, 159 N, and Stammers, 136 N, in the execution of their duty, and also with assaulting William George Bird, a labourer. Mr. TTRwssIvT said, of all men on the face of the earth a man like the grsoner should be the most carefuL He should fhne him Os. for each assault, 31 in all, or in default of payment six weeks in the Housef o Correction, He was not quite certain that he ought not to have beat him to prison without the option of a fine. Tho money in the course of the morning was paid. THAIs.-Two Arabs, called Mahomet and Ali, belo ing to the ship Bombay Catle lying in the Victoria Lock, were brought up on remand before Mrr. SELYE, charged with feloniously cutting and wounding two Manilla seamen, namned Francisco Leprancho and MAriano Francisco. Two interpreters were required in the investigation of the case. One of them, Normoyle, an intelligent police contable, No. 133 H, translated the evidence of the injured men into English, and after Mr. Bowdler, the second clerk, had taken it down It was explained by -Mr. Levy, another interpreter, to the prisoners in the Hindo3tanee language. It appeared that the iffay out of which this investigatlon arose took place in a low neighbourhood called Victoriastreet, Shadwell, inhabited by desperate thieves, savago prostitutes, and men of colour. On the night of Sunday, the 27th ult, after some wild orgies in the den of infamy where the affray took place, and where no respect is paid to the Christian Sabbath, the prisoners run-.muck with their sheath knives and wounded no fewer than six persons, one of whom, a seaman, was sufficientlyrecovered to be enabled to proceed to sea on Saturday. Another of the mufferers a women, was not sufficiently recovered to enable her to at. tend yesterday, but the two Manilla men came forward for the first time. The prisoner AU, whose head was bandaged, was suffering from a severe wound he had received after be had stabbed several persons. Mr. SXyrX Inquired if all the witnesses were present In court, and the reply was that one of them had gone to wea, and others had been kept out of the way either through fear or otherwise. Mr. SELrE eild, hewas determined the case should pro. ceed, and he intended to send it before a jury for trial, Mr. Francis Owen, house-surgeon of the London HoEpital, Eald, that on the night of Friday, the 27th ult. the two Mfanilla men, Lepandro and Francho, were brougt to the Institution a little before midnight. Francisco had a small wound not quite an inch long over the breastbone - Lepancho was wounded in the back, just under the right sboulder bladebone. The wound was nearly three inches long and an inch and a-half deep. Ele considered it was a dangerous wound if erysipelaz had supervened. Tho other man's wound was such that if the instrument with which it was infficed had not glanced off the breastbone, it would most probably have caused death. Mr. Sna7x-When dld the men leave the hospital? Mr. Owen.-One of them went out yesterday, and the other this morning. Mariano Francisco said Ali stabbed him in the breat with a sAUor's knife. Hje gave no provocation whatever. Mabomet then came up, and advanced towards Lepancho, who ran away. Mahomet followed him, and stabbed himi on the back with a knife, and the blood flowed copioulV from the wound. Lepancho fell exhausted from loss of blo They were both taken to the h _it d L Lepanoho, who was in a wAly condition, gave confirmatory evidence, and said he was not aware of any quarrel when he entered the street in question. Mr. SELFB ordered that the witnesses should be bound over to prosecute, and said, the other persons who witnesse the sanguinary affray, one of the mo3it disgraceful he hadi ever known, and the people who had been wounded, mus attend on a future occasion, He would issue summons for their attendance. A policeman said, a seaman who had been stabbed by one of the prisoners bad gone to sea. MIr. SELrL-Then my smmons can't reach him. Two pollce-constables, named Lane, No. 397 K, and RoebuckZ 446 K, produced two large sheath knives stained with bloo thl they took from the prisoners, and said they made a determined resistance before they were taken into cus. tody, t r. Soy . after some conversation with Mr. Howie the superitendentof the K division, and a gentleman Krom the Strangers' Home who promised that the Manila men should be provided for in that excelient asylum, remanded the prisoners until Thursdy, and said they would then be committed for trial LIA,ETnE.-Alice Daiey, a tall, well-dressed womar with an infant in her arms, was charged with robbing and druggln,;Joseph Parry at a common brothel, 93, Granby. stee,aterloo-road. The prisoner aid, she was intoxicated at the time or sbe would not have committed the offenoe. She was sntenced to four months' hard labour in the Wandsworth House of Correction under the Summary Criminal Act.

MUTINY IN INDIA .-THB RELIEF FUYD. THE CITY OF LONDON. Yesterday the Lord Mayor received through the Mereantile Bank of India, London, and China a check for 1006. from his Highness Meer All Morad, of Xheerstord, Upper Scinde, as his subscription to the Eund for the Relief of the Sufferers in India. LAMBETH. A public meeting of the inbabitants of the parish of Lambeth was held last evening at the Boys' Schoolroom, Lam. beth-green, iMr. Teague in the chair. The CicAIsmAN having briefly opened the proceedings, The Rev. MIr. INGELuX&1, the rector, moved the first resolutlon as follows:- " That the very sad and distresing conditions of those 'who are sufferins In consequence of the imutiny in India has the strongest claim upon the sympathles of aU Englishmen, and that every exertiou shou!d be made to relieve their wants." While deploring the horrors of whioh they had read, it was an imperative duty of the people of this country to pray to the God of battles to Interpose His Almighty power in our behalf, and also to show their sincerity by contributing to the utmost of their means to the relief of those who had been ruined by the sad events in the East. To the ladies especially ho appealed, recommending them to consider and adopt the advice contained in an excellent letter which appeared In The Times a few days ago, suggesting that byf a lttle economy in dress an immense deal of good milght be The Rev. 0. HAYDON seconded the resolution, and, after giving a brief outline of the gradual growth of our Indian empiro, said, that the outbreak in India was the result of a deep laid conspiracv, in which the antagonistic elements of Hino%sm ind Mahomedanism had united to bring about the utter destruction of English rule. While there had been deeds of horror there had also been deeds worthy of the highest admiration, and the cheering news which had just arrived led them to hope that the worst phase of the rebellion had been passed. The causes of this rebellion appeared to be somewhat uncertain. HIe believed that as between the Government and the Sepoys no aause had been given for the rebellion. But there was a cause for tte outbreak In the long continued degradation of Christianity by the British Government in India. In the very army which had now revolted against us Christianity had been forbidden, and the trials to which this country was now exposed appeared to be the retributive justice of an all-wise Providence. The missionaries, whose labours had been sneered at, had done much good, and instead of causing the rebellion had greatly tended to diminsh its intensity. The fund which was being raised for the relief of the sufferers was already a large one, but it would be all needed, and he was glad to fLnd that The Times had devoted one-third of the 10,0001. balance remaining from its Crimean fund to this exceltent purpose. (lear). Mr. HI .L proposed, as an addition to the resolution, - That this meeting expresee Ita deep dlsapprobatlon of the poucy pursued by the East India Company towards the Christtan religion o india." Hle condemned the Goverumert countenance which had beea given to idolatry in India, and which wvas as dangerous to our power as it was disgraceful to our religion. Mr. n111VAnRDS seconded the amendment, which, however, was negatived, and the original resolution agreed to. The Rev. Mr. G ILMAN moved the second resolution " That this mceUng desires to testify its sympathy with those who through the mutiny have suffered unpsaalleled cruelties, privation, aud 1oes, and offes Its condolence with the relatives and friends of those whose uves have been so treacherousl7y sacriicd In this atrocious outbreak.' The rev. gentleman thought the rebellion was the consequence of the cause of half measures that bad been pursued India. At the same sime, while blaming the Government for neglect, It should be remembered that until very recently the public mind waS perfectly apathetic in respect to India, and a discussion upon that subject had not sufficient interest to attract 40 members in the Houso of Commons. The resolution having been seconded by the Rev. Mr. GlEE- was unanimously adopted. Mr. TAYLOR proposed the next resolution,- 3" -or the appointment of a committee to oollect sbecriptlons from house to house, and Dledging the meetln to contribite to the fund tor the relief of tho Indian sufferesm." The motion having been seconded was carried unanimously. A vote of thanks was given to the chairman and the meeting separated, a collection being made at the doors. ILFiACOMBE. At a meeting held In the national schoolroom, lfracombe, September 19, in aid of the sufferers In India, the icar 1i the chair, It was resolved- "That thiS meeting desire to express their deepsympatby with their fellow-Countrymen, women, and chldren. and native Christians iu Ind4a, In the cruel gufferugs they have endured, and inasnuch as a lasge number are left thereby Iu great poverty and dlstress, both in india and England, this nmeetilg anxiously entreat their fellow-townsmen, viitors, and the public at large to unite iu the relief of these their sufferiog by a liberal contributIon.- A committee was formed, an honorary secretary and treasurer appointed, and the result has been, that 2301. has been collected.

TRB LATE BORRIBLB MURDER AND MUTILATION. During the whole of yesterday the yard of Bow-street Polioe-court wvas crowded with numbers of persons anxious to inspect the olothes of the murdered man, the discovery of whose remains has created so deep a sensation throughout the metropolis. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that not o= of the many hundreds who gratified their morbid oariosity in this respect was seeking for trace of either friend or relative. Nevertheless, the authorities gave free ingress to all who chose to examine the dress ; for, as none know the quarter in which the clue to this mystery may be found,the widest publicity Is sought by the police, who wvould wish, if possible, that all London should see the clothes. We would, however, beg with the utmost deference to suggest that the police are not exactly pursuing that course which is most likely to lead to the dress being identified, We have already stated that all the articles have beea immersed in brine, and are therefore shrunken; they have been roughly ripped from the corpse, and are therefore much torn ; and, in addition to this, they are soiled with earth and other marks, and deeply stained with blood, so that even those the most familiar with their former aspect, could now only recognize them after close inspection. It was of courso necessary that they should have been produced before the jury in the state in which they were found; it is now only necessary that they should be Identified, and to that end they ought as speedily as possible to be restored to the appearance which they must have presented when worn by the deceased before his murder. For this purpose they should be sewn together again, the most disfiguring of the earthstains removed, and the whole suit fitted upon a lay figure like those which stand in the shop windows of so many tailors. If this is done the public might be admitted to walk past them in a stream all day. and then they milght be recognized. Up to the present they have not been identifiod, and as long as they remain a mere dirty pile of rags they are never likely to be. The most absurd rumours are constantly afloat as to the head and other missing portions of the body having been found, the woman having been traced by means of the cab she employed, &o. Unfortunately. for these reports there is no foundation, and up to last night the mystery which envelopes the whole atrocity remained as dark as at the first discovery of the fragments of the body, At present the chanoes of any trace being obtained are very slight, though the police are still endefati gable in their-endeavours. The following was Isued yesterday from the Metropolitan Police-office, Whitehallplace:- £100 Reward.-Wherem a earpetbag, containing parts of a human body and the tollowing articles of wearing apparel, was found on one of the abutments of WVaterloo-bridge on the morning of Psiday, the 9th of October, and ftrom the appearance of the clothes It is suppoeed that a man has been murdered, a reward of £i00il be paid by Her Maeestys Government to any peraon or pesaons who shall give nchbnformation and evidence a shall lead to the appretesnion and oonvIction of the person or persons guilty of the murder; and a eward of £100 wll bo paid to any person or peresons who shal give ench Information as will lead to the identUficatler and apprehension of the peroou or pemOUs who placea the carpetbag tLu the pition where it was found. The Secretary of State for the Home Department wi advise the grant of Her Majestyb pardon to any accosaplce, not being a person who so tualy committed the nsurder, who will give such evidence as ehall lead to the conviction of any of the guty parties. Description of the artioles found -An Imtation Brarela carpetbag, large sae; dlower pattem-rowes, forget-me. note, and leaves; leather bottom, aldes, and handles; '4S' in Ink on one handle.

About half-past 11 p.m. on Thursday, October 8, a female, age between 50 and 60, rather short and stout, complexion sallow, hair gray, dres black silk mantle, drab satin or sIk bonnet, passed on to Waterloo-bridge, on the Strand side, carying a carpetbag, similar to the one described, sud a brown paper paroeL Information to be given to Snperintendent Durkin, rollcoetation, Bow-street, or at any of the statious of the metropolitan police,"
THE DOUBLB MUBDER AT BATH. The adjourned inquest was resumed yesterday morning at 10 o'clock. Charles King was the first witness examined.-He deposed -I am bailiff to hir. Skrine, and knew the prisoner Thomas Miler. I saw him on Saturday morning between 8 and 9 o'clock. He looked in a wild deranged state. I spoke to the prisoner, and he said that he was very ill I said, "'What Is the matter?' He replied he was in pain all over, and he kept seeing things before his eyes like angels. He asked me whether he bad not better go to the doctor, and I replied, " You had better go to Mr. Edwards." He wished to go to Bath with me to go to the bospitaL In consequence of the appear. ance of the prisoner I went to my master's house, and ordered the nuse to give him medicine to remove the pains from his head. I believe the prisoner had the medicine I was in the habit of seeing the prisoner daily for the last 10 years, I never saw him In so bad a state before. He was given to drink when he could get it, but he was not a drunkard. I have seen him intoxicated, and he was then very ridiculous. He was sober when I sa w him on Saturday, the day of the murder. Had known persons suffer from delirium tremens, but that was not the case in this instance, and never saw the prisoner in such a state. I saw prisoner two hours before the murder was committed, and paid him his wages. He was then in an unsettled state of mind, and said they were all teazing him. I said, " Who, Tom ?" and he said Mrs. Border had been asking him if he knew anything of the murder committed at Leigh Woods. He then said, " What can I do ia it?" and I advised him to take no notice, and promised to speak to them next day. Prisoner did his work as well as ursual up to the time he left on Saturday evening. Mr. Edwards, surgeon, then deposed to havig made a piost mortem examination of the body of Andrew Border, assisted by Mr. Edwin Skeate, surgeon, of Bath, andbhad discovered, on laying open the abdomen of the deceased, that, beyond a doubt, the wound inP.ieted wvas the cause of death. This being the whole of the evidence as touchisg the death of Andrew Border, the jury were resworn to consider the cause of the death of his wife. The Coroner having informed the jury that the same evidence, with the addition of the medical testimony respecting the post mortem examination of the woman, would bear equally on this case Mr. Edwards said, that on opening the chest there was a wound in .ie aorta an inch in length and an inch from the body of the heart. The pericardium was full of blood, and two or three quarts of blood ere found in. the left cavity of the chest. The death must have been instantaneous from tho effusion of blood. The skull was fractured. The Coroner then directed the jury to consider their ver. diot, impressing upon them the necessity of excluding from their consideration the state of mind the prisoner was in at the time he committed the act. The jury, after a short consultation, returned a verdlot of "Wilful Murder" against Thoomas Miller. The prisoner still .les In a very weaL- state at his motber's residence at Warlegh, but there is sorme probability of his recovery. The mother of the prisoner was not examinod in consequence of her depressed fspirits, which had produeed ill health. The medical certificate given to Superintendent Gould will prevent the unfortunate man Miller from being removed for the present.
ARRIVAL or SrEci:.-LrvzRiPOOL, Tuesday.- The clipper ship Red Jacket, Captain O'Eloalaran, of the White Star Line of Australlian packets, arrived this morning from Melbourne, whence she sailed on the 19th of JUIY. She brings 70,000 ounces of gold, besides a large quantity in the hands of passengers of whom she has 126 *00 bales of wool, and a quantity of other produce, such as tallow, wine (colonial), hides, &a. The Red Jacket had fine weather to the south point of Van Diemen's Land, to which she ran in seven days. Subsequently she experienced very heavy weather for a week, and was conpelled to stand far to the north. Half the passage from Van DIemen's Land to Cape Horn was made m eight days, but I gat and variable winds afterwards retarded her progress, On former pasages the Red Jacket has rounded the Ca7e in 22 days, but on this one she was 37 In doing It. From the Cape to the LiLne she was 20 days, or 57 days from Melbourne; from the line to Liverpoel her time was 28 days. 'The vessel had no north-east trades. To the parallel of 150 north she experienced very light winds from all points. From the Cape Verds she ran to Holyhead in 15 days, After experiencing the heavy weather in the South Pacific the] royals were never stowed, exceptingfor an hour. ThIE WXSTnnsTERn BRLLs.-Our readers will be Interested to know that all the Westminster quarter bells are now cast. The notes are B, B (the octave above the great bell), F sharp, and G sbarp. The B bell weighs about four tons and the other three together a little more than four tons, so that the whole peal, including the great bell of nearly 16 tons, weighs as nearly as possible 24 tons, as originally estimated. If the tower and the iron beams are ready for them they may be taken up in the course of the next month, and the clock is ready to follow them.
