BA.L WAY INTBLLrGtNcz. RAIMWAV RPM.TPTR The traffilo returns of railways in the united kingdom published for the week ending August 1 amounted to 525,3911, and for the corresponding week of 1856 to W04,8514, showing an increase of 20,540U Tho gross receipts of the eight railways having their termini in the metropolis amounted, for the week ending as above, to 225,3761., and for the corresponding week of last year to 223,50l., showing an increase of 1,8761 The incr8se on the Eastern Counties Railway amounted to 442.; on the Great Northern to 5701; on the Great Western to 1,918l; and on the London and North-Western to 2,5064. -total, 5,436L. But from this must be dedecteA 1521., the decrese on the London andBlackwall; 7571. on the London, Brighton, and South-Coast; 2,3441. on the London and South-Western; and 3071. on the South. Eastern; together, 3,5601., leaving the increase, as bove, 1,8761. The roceipts on the other lines in the united kingdom amounted to 300,015l., and for the corresponding period ox 1856 to 281,351l4, showing an Increase of 18,664. hi the reocipts of those lines, which, added to the increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 20,5404 as compared with the oorresponding week of 1856. The following are the receipts of railways for the past week- GREAT WESTERN. The directors of this oompany have determined to recommend to the propnietors the declaration of a dividend for the half-year ending the 30th of June, 1857, at the rate of 1 per cent, per rrgiar forward a balance for the Current hal_year 0,00 NORTH LONDON. The report of the directors of this company states that the accounts of the working of the railway during the past halfyear show a nt balance of 20,7621. This wil admit of a dividend of 2i per cent. for the past half-year, being tho same as that declarod in August, 186, although the stock and share capital of the company has been increa8ed by 17,30&., and now amounts to 918,2207 The receipts from passengers and goods show an Increase of 3,6621. over those of the corresponding six months of 1856. The work of relaying the pernanent way with fish-ointed rails and new sdeepers has been carried on durlng the past year to a larger extent than heretofore, and the whole e nse having been charged against revenue the acounts show an increase under this head. In other respects the expenses bear a fair comparison with those of the corresponding six months of last year. The capital account shows that 1,327,376a had boen received and expended, including 14,6167. due to revenue. The revenue account for the half. year ending June 30 shows that 61,0621. had been reoeived, and 33,7164 expended, leaving a balance of 28,1341. SALISBURY AND YEOVIL The report of the directors of this company states that they were enabled to withdraw their opposition to the Dor-set Central Railway BUIl by concluding an agreement between the two companies to the foUowing effect:-That the compulsory powers for the purchase of land between Temple Combo and Bruton should not be exercised after two years from the passing of the Act; that the line be. tween those points should be completed and open for traffic within three years after the passing of the Act; that all traffic arising at Bruton station, or between Bruton station and Temple Combe, and not coming off the Somerset Central Railway, and destined for pla4es between Salisbury and Soathampton or london and including those places to which the Salisbury and Yeovil Railway can give through rates, be handed over to the Salisbury and Yeovil Company at Temple Combe. Acrangements have been satisfactorily concluded for carry. mg out the Sherborne deviation, and affording a prospeot of a speedier completion of the works. The question relating to tho stntion at Salisbury has also been settled. A traffic 'greement has been concluded between the two companies, under which the South-Western Company will furnish the roling stock and work and maintain the line in perpetuity at 42. per cent, on the earnings. In conclusion, the directors state that their relations with the South-Western Company Are of the most amicable character. Mr. Locke, the engineer, states in his report that on obtaining pos3ession of the remaining land between Gilling. bam and Yeovi1, and between Salisbury and Wilton, there wil be no impediment to the rapid progress of the works along tho whole course of the line. The capital account shows that 108.0194 had been received, and 69,5074 expendod, leaving a balance of 38,5124 SEMEWSBURY AND WELSEPOOL. Yesterday tho third half-yearly mesting of this oompany was held at the IAon Hotel, Shrewsbury. The Earl of Powls presided. The report stated that the directors had not considered It prudent to undertake any active operations durlng the pust half-year, in consequence of the contnued unoertainty as to the proceedings of the Oswestry and Newtown, That oompany was, however, about to proceed with the constraction of its line. The directors would during the ensuing halfyear maturely consider the position of the Shrewsbury and Welshpool Company, as they desired to avoid any further VIM balance-sheet showed that the total receipta amounted on the 30th of June last to 13,61214 and the payments to 4~6767.,leaving balance f 8.3612 7- eCeii On On the motion of the Ca&nlM~?~ the report was Tahepreocedings terminated with avote of thanks to the MIDDLESBROUGH AND XEDCARL T he half-y eary m ege tin g oft° his c om hp an y wa s bh eld yester The accounta Is6owed that 5,13. had been raised on capital account, of which about 4,500W. remained In The aucounts were adopted and a 6 per oent, dividend was declared.

Unles it Ws that the rails were more slippery fromu the rain than he had calculated upon, and he was unable to bring up hIs gene in a reasonable distance, there can be no doubt he was gnulty of gross neglgenoe. The matter certainly demands, as we preame it wi receive, thorough inquiry. (BT ELECIRIC A-ND nlUERATIONAL TXLZGRAIH.) Lady Londesborough and her daughter, the Hon. Mis Denison, were among the persons who were injured. These ladies were in a carriage that was about to be detached for Hull, to which town they were about to proceed to meet Lord Londesborough and to attend the annual ball of the Hull Pegatta. Both Lady Londesborough and her daughter have their faces bruised, and the former received a severe contasion of one of her legs Both the ladies returned to Lord Londesborougi's seat, Grimston-park, near Tad. caster, where they were joined the same evening by Lord Londesborough, who on reoeiving information of the cident by electric telegraph took a special trin from Hull to Tadcaster. Happily both the ladies are likely to recover, the report as to the state of their health from Grimston. house yesterday (Friday) morning being of a favourable character.
STATE OP TRADX. MACHESTEE, A7jG. 7. Yans and cloths continue firm, but the upward tendency of prices is for the present at an end. This IB partly owing to the eaier state of the Liverpool cotton-market, where the ales for this week past have bnen oaL * moderate scale, with but little business for gpeculation and exporL Great firm. ness prevails in the cloth-market for all kinds of heavy goods, such va domestics, long-cloths, and T-cloths, and though there is less business in these fabrics than of late, still a moderate demand is reported. There is aso some little businesw in printing-cloths, and manu. facturers are looking for more money rather than a decline of prices. There is not much doing in 40-inch shirtings; some snma quantities have gone off, but until more enoDuraging acounts arrive from India no improvernent worth naming is expeted. A moderate demand for 36-inch shirtings has sprung up. Por yarns there is but a quiet market, but spinners have a good many orders on hand, and stooks being much reduced, priees are steady at Ist week's rates.

P&TITIOr FBOM THE QUBEB AND PBRNCES OF OUDE. WTe following is the petition from the Queen Dowager and the Princes of Oade, which was presented on Thursday by Lord Campbell to the House of Lorda, but which their Lordships declined to reeeive on accoant of an objection baving been taken to It by Lord Redesdale, because it did not style itsef " the humble petition." A memoril to Her Majesty has also been prepared, the terms of which ar identical with these :- " The petition of the undersigned Jenabi Auliah Tajara Begum, the Queen-Mother of Oude; mirza mohumand HAmid dlie, eldest son and heir apparent of His Majesty the King of Onde; and Mirza Mohummuld Jowaad Auie Sekunder Hushmut Bahadoor, next brother of His MAjesty lhe King of Oude, showeth,- " That -yotrx potitioriers have head with &onero regret the tidings whie have reached the British kingdom of dis. affection prevailing among the native troops In India; and that they desire, at the earliest opportunity, to give public expression to that solemn assurance which they some time since eonveyed to Her Majesty's Government, that the fidelity and attachment to Great Britain which has ever chbactesized tbeBRoyal family oi Onde continues nnobanged aisd unaffected by these deplorable events, and tbat they remai, as Lord Dalbonsie, the late Governor-General of India, emphatically declared them, 'a Boyal race, ever faithful and trae to their friendshiip with the British nation.' "That In the midst of this great public calamity your petitioners have sustalned their own peculiar cause of Pain and sorrow in the intelligenee which bas reached them through the publio papers that HEs Majesty the King of Onde haa been subjected to restraint at Oalcutta and deprived of the nmeans of communicating even with your petitioners, his mother, son, and brother. " That your petitioners desire unequivocallyand solemnly to assure Her Majesty and your lordships that if His Majesty the King of Onde has been sauspected of any complicity in the recent disastrous occurrences, such suspidcon is not only wholly and absolutely unfounded, but is directed against one the whole tenor of whose life, character, and conduct directly negatives all such imputations. Your Pe.: titioeraes r1ecl to the recolleotion of your lordaships the facts relating to the dethronement of the King of Oade, as set forth in the petition presented to the House of Commons by Sir Fitzroy Kelly on the 25th of May last, that when resistance might have been made, and was even anticipated by the British general, the King of Oude directed his guards and troops to lay aside their arms, and that when it was announced to him that the territories of Oude were to be vested for ever in the Hon. East India Company, the King, instead of offering resistance to the British GovernIment, after giving vent to his feelings in a burst of grief, descended froa hMs tbrone, declaring kis determination to seek for justice at ESer MajestWs Throne and from the Par. liament of England. " That since their resort to this country, in obedience to Es Majesty' commands, your petitioners have received rommunications from Hlis Majesty which set forth the hopes and aspirations of his heart- that tho'e conunications not only negative all suppoeition of His Majests'a personal compheity in any inbrigues, but fill the minds of your petitiomers with the profounad conviction?tbat His Majesty would feel, with your petitioners, the greatest grief and pain at the events which hixve occurred. And your petitioners desire to declare to your lordships and to assure the British nation, that although suffering, in common with his heartbroken family, from the wrongs inflicted on them, from the humiliations of a state of exile, and their loss of home, authority, and country, the King of Oude relies only on the justice of his cause, appeals only to Her Majesty's Throne aDd to the Parliament of Great Britain, and disdains to use Ihe ann of the rebel and the traitor to maintain the right he seeks to vindicate. " Your petitioners, therefore, pray of your lordships that, in the exercise of your autbority, you will cause justice to be done to Hlis Majesty the King of Oude, and that it may be forthwith explicitly made known to His Majesty and to your petitioners wherewith he is chrged, and by whom and on what authority, so that the King of Oude may have full opportunity of refuting and disproving the unjust auspicionq and calumnies of which he is now the helpless victim. And you-r petitioners further pray that the dng of Oude may be permitted freely to correspond with your petitioners in this country, so that tbey may also have opportunity of vindicating here the character and conduct of their Sovereign and relative. of establishing his innocence of any offence against the Crown of England or the British Government or people, and of showing tbat, under every varying phase of cirDumstance. the loyal family of Oude have continued steadfst and true to their friendship with the British nation. - Ana your petitioners will ever pray, &c."
215tHB OHI:J;SB AT AMOY. TO TRE EDITOlt OF TE TIMES. Sir,-The mibjoined extr of a letter from Amoy, in China, of the dte of June 3, gives a most gratifying indication of the state of matters there, and ie in pleasing con. treat to the warlike operatiors in the Canton river. I am. Sir. vomrs. an.- DONALD MATHESON,. Malvern, Aug. 6. "1A-moy, Tune 3. "Among the signs of friendly feeliDg at Amoy one of the most remarkable bas been a complment paid to the foreigners and to the Queen by a semi-official body at Axaoy, usually called "The Committee of Ptblie Safety, consisting of the moat influential people of the place. This conumittee iasued invitations to the consular authorities, the naval officers, and all the merchants and mskslonaries of the plaue to a dinner on the 23d of May, intended, doubtless, as the Queen's birthday. The invitations included even the ladies, but these and a few others did not go. The place was a large temple, called 'Lam-po-to,' about two miles from the town. The table was prepared for -s in Europen style, 'while the Chinese entertainers bad their own table in their own style in an adjoining room. Two of their number were deputed to sit at the head and foot of our table, being selected, the one because he could talk Spanish, and the other because he knew Malay. If our Hongkong friends bsd heard of the preparations before learning the auspicions termination they may; very probably have trembled for our safety, but I can assure you that the most perfect cordiality prevaled, and that no one suffered any evil consequences from the Chinese hospitality. It was a little amnsing to see the endeavoors of our chairman to get a promise from the captain of the man-of-war that he would put down any insurrection that might occur, but of course he took good care to give no such assurance. " On Monday, the 25th of Mfay, I had the pleasure of meeting at dinner at the British Consulate two of the mandarins, one, the commander of the Amoy land forces, who is at present an Amoy man, the other the Controller of Customs, who is a Manchoo. We had a great deal of very pleasant intercourse with them, and they seemed quite at ±ir ease and qiite cordial with us."

The Genera1 Board of Health Continumnce BilL tbe. Attorneys and Solitore (Colonial Cours) Bill, and the tunicipal Corporations Bill, were read a second time. BURIAL ACTS Ah1MEKNDMEXT BIIL. On the motion for the second reading of this Bill, The Bishop of LONDON, said that he had been requestedc to make a statement, on the part of a right rev. prelate who was unable to attend, with referenoe to the Sa ea ,came.' tery. It was supposed that that right rev, prelate had, in' some way or other, put himself in opposition to the clergy of his diooes, but the sole object of the opposition made by the right rev. prelate to the consecration of Swansea oemetery had been, as he (the Bishop of London) understood, to proteot the rights of the clergyman of Swansca. As he was informed, the cemetery was so diBsnt from the town that It ws almost impossible for the clergyman of Swanse to perform the bural service there without great pecuniary, loss. The bishop, considering it to be his duty to do what he oould 'for the benefit of a clergyman whose emoluments in all, amnounted to only 290L a-year, aDd who, if he had been obliged to undertake the journey to the cemetey daiy would have been subjected to serious pecuniay loss, 2 thought it right to interpoae in a. manner in which he was fully persuaded that the law authorized him to do inl orderI to prevent thst loss. It had been said publicly that ths rig t rev. prelate bad violated the law; but the bishop wa' of opinion-not with reason as It appeared to him-that the very fact of a new Bill being introduced to alter the law, so s tooom,pel him to consecrate the ground, seemed to show that the law had been in his favour before. If the right rev, prelate had violated the law, it could not be supposed that in his position, or indeed in any position In this country, the law was not strong enough to vindicate Itself. There wags ns indifidni the land who was above the law; and he was quite sure that the right rev. prelate d ated conscientiously in this matter according So his view of what the law weas. (Hear, hear.) AA there was a commron impress1on tbat all thess difficolties with regard to the consecration of burial grounds originated with the bUiopsh it was well that it shouid be known that in this diocess there was a great cemetery for the city of London, conssting of nearly 100 parises, and that that cemetery had not yet been consecrated-not orn account of any difficulty preFeated by the bishop of the diocese, but simply because the Burial Brd thought that, as intruated with the public interests, they were entitled to oppose an obstacle in the 'v ay of the consecration of that cemeter. Still it would. have been rezarded as something unfair if he had risen in his place in Februar lt and had stated that the Bu Board of the city of London were violating the law because they availed themselves of that which the law obviously allowed-viz., of their power to place an obstacle ln the way of the consecration of that ground. If he migbt be permitted, he vould say one -word vith respect to two clauses in the Bill, the 12th and 13th, which bad no connexion with bishops or with consecration, but which he believed would have a most injurious effect on the operatida of the measure. They in.! troduced the principle of competition between consecrated and 'nzconsecratea grounds, and It was of the utmost importance that no such competition should exist, but that the poor sbould have the opportunity of being btried as cheaply in the one as in the other. (Hear, hesr.) In one 8reat, ppasish of the cit persons might be buried more cheaply in unconsecrated than in consecrated ground- but in that paxrish the number buried in the consecrated ground where the charges were higher was equal to that buded in the unconsecrated ground. In Marylebone, however, where the charges were alike, nearly 5.000 had been buried in the cousecrated ground to only 30 in the unconsecrated ground. The result, therefore, of making burials cheaper in unconsecrated ground would bet as he was informed by A deputation that had waited upon hbm that day, that the undertakers, who generally contracted for the funerals of the poor' would induce them, sometimes by deceit, sometimes bY other means, to be baried in unconsecrated ground. He was told that the most revolting scenes had occurred in consequence of this. Only a few days ago a chaplain of one - of these cemeteries assured him that it was no unfrequent circuxostance for bodies to be removed after interment when the relations of the coor discovered the fraud which had been practlsed upon them, or, if the word fraud was rather too strong a one to use, the manner in which tbey had been misled; and in other cases a very strong fee ineg was displayed. The fact was that the poor wished to be buried with the rites of the Church of England, and it was of gre4t importnce that there should be nothing to detract from the solemnity and the proper performance of these rites. If, however, the principle of competition were introduced, a feeling of dissatisfaction would inevitably grow up on both sides, and in place of adopting such a principle It would te far better to followr the example of Marylebone, maldng tt e fees the sarme for interments both in consecratea and uncon. secrated ground. This question hAd a bearing upon the pecuniary interest of the clergy, but it Was tot with reference to that interest that he was now speaking. He made these observations on account of the unfortunate scenes which, he was assured, occurred in burialgrounds owing to the introduction of the principle which appeared to be em. bodied in the 12th clause. He also begged their lordships to consider that it was the bounden duty of the bishops of the church to defend, if they possibly could, the interests of the parochlal clergy of this country. Returns lately published would show that the metropolitan clergy had suffered the greatest pecuniary loss in consequence of the measures lately adopted. Many, with large families to sapports who had devoted their lives to the service of their feUow.creatures, had been reduced almost to destitution, yet they had offered no opposition to these measures, which were believed to be for o public good. (Hear, hear.) He could not help thEnking that had they been members of the legal profession, or persons who = ed any great election influence, theirinterests would ave been better attended to, and they would probably have obtained compensation. (ear.) It was, however, reaUy beartrending to know show many exceUent men, with lage families and salul means, had been reduced almost to want in order to advance the public good by measures making better provision for the burial of the dead, The clergy had no desire to claim pecuniary compensation on this ground, but they did think that in assoag such o measure as the present everything ought to done w hich would conduco to the orderly and decorous burial of the dead. (Eear, hear.) That these evils were not occasioned by the bishops only he might be allowed once more to say. No man was ever less likely to give way to foolish or fanatical prejudices than the prelate whom he succeeded in the see of London. Of that ri, t rev. prelate be oin btnotto speakto-daywithout declaring owaffectionately ang how faithfully he had for so many years discharged the great duties of his sphere. (Hear, hear.) Their lordships had, in common with all the inhabitants of this metropolis, heard with a feeling of deep re8et that it had pleased God to remove Dr. Blom5ield from tCis world, though they would of course rejoice were he removed fromn a scene of suffering. If ever there was a man who with deep conscientiousness and with untiriug energy performed his episcopal functions, sacrificing his time and his health to the public good it was the late prelate. Re, too, was ever free from foolish pre. judioes, snd was sable clearly to see wbhat concessions ought to be made to the rightful demands of his fellow.men, yet be bequeathed to his successor a difloult legacy arising out of the eonseoratlon of the llford cemetery. No man could say that the latebishop was to blame in the transaction h but the fact was that these were very dificnlt and complicated questions, requiring very calm and dispassionate examination. He did trust, therefore, tbat vwen this BR Iwas inl committee no acousations would be bandied about from one side to the other, as though rlght rev. prelates acted regardless of the feelings of their fellow-mnen, but that full credit would be given to them for a desire to do their daty conscientiously, (Hear, hear.) Earl GRA2TVILLE hoped the Bill would be discussed in the spirit whioh had been recommended by his right rev fi lend. Nothing could be more unfair than to mke sweep imng hbarges against the episcopal bench on the subject, but at the same time a minority of right rev. prelates, differing from the greater portion of their episoopal brethren, had pursued a course vwhich seemed to him to have been an inconvenient one. With regard to the right rev. prelate whose acts were more particularly questioned at the present moment, it would be more satisfactory to the How that any discuson on the case of the Swarsea cemetery shoald take place when he was preseut. He (Earl Granville) was sure the right rev. prolate most oonscientiously believed himself bound to act as he had done. From the reports in the morningpapers of what had occurred in anothernplace he gathered that the charge made against him was that, in order to secure what he considered an act of justice to the incumbent the bishop had neglected to do what the words of the Act appeared to show he was bound to do. The point was one, however, which seemed to involve a question of law, and their lordsbips would not be disposed to go into it in bis absence. With regard to what had fallen from the right rev. prelate, he (Earl Granville) agreed that there ought to be no competition between the consecrated and the unconsecrated grounad. But the Dissenters complained that practically theypaid more for burial in unconsecrated ground than was paid for interments in consecrated ground, ad the object of the clause to which zeference had been rade was to prevent competition. In conclusion, he would express his regret in common with all their lordships at the loss which had been sustained by the death of one who had so lately occupied the episcopal bench, and felt assured that the House would warmly conour in the eulogiums so eloquently passed by his right rev. suc. essor, (ear, hear.) The Bill was then read a second tume ILLICIT DISTILLATION (IRELAND) BIIL. Lord STANLBY of ALDERLEY moved the seond reading of this BiI. Lord tONTEAGLB understood that the Government did not Intend to employ the constabulary force in Ireland in still-bunting. He could speak from personal knowledge and experience of the exoellent maunner in rhich the revenue police of Ireland had disharged their duties.-Theywere organized by General Reardon, who by his exe-tions converted tat oorps into onD of the most admirable body of men that could be foud in any country. As some 80 or 90D of them had been disbanded, he wisbed to tuggest to hig noble friend theSecretay for War that e would ac wisely by andeavooring to induoe those admirably trained men to entsr into the service of ner Majesty. Lord PANMURE.-The moment I hexrd that they were disbanded I sent over immediately to Ireand to ascertain howlrouldgetthem. (&IaugLbn The Bill was rad a second time. The reports of the amendments made in the Fradulent Trustees, c, WBM and the Trustees Relitd Bi were agreed to. The Canada and New BrunswickBoundaries Bill was read a third time and passed. The Burlalgrounds (Scotland) Act (1855) Amendment Bill w read a second time, VALUATION OIF L&NDSSCOTLNAND) ACT AIEND- The order of the day for the second reading of this Bill having been read, The Duke of BUCCLB1JCH msid, the Bill Dontained very arbitrarypowers. It enacted that if counties did not choo6e to appoint their own valuatozs the Commissoners of Iland Rtevenue might appoint assessors, whoee valuation was t be made for all purposes relating to the income-tax or any other taxes collected wnder the authority of these omramissioners He was mrprisd that such a Bill had escaped notice in the House of Commons. It would malke very geat and at the same time very unnecessary chauges in the present system of valuation in Scotland, and he therefore moved that it be tead a second time that day three months. Lord PANMURE said the object of the Bill ws simply to proteCt the revenue. In the firt place, it gave the revenue the power of appointing its own valuators, and, in the next, it gave the counties the option of adopting the valuation or assessments made by the valuators of the revenue. He thonght it would be to the advantage of the counties to avail themselves of that power. The Bill woul not impse any new burden upon tbe people of Scotlaud, Hs noble friend was in error it he vmpposed that the Bill had poased through the other House without the knowledge of the ScochaLmebers, and sa proof that it had not escaped their notice he might mention that it contained a local clause which was inserted on the motioL of a member of the other House, whose vigilant attention to all matters relating to Scotland was we1 known. The BiR would simply enable the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to ooUect thAt revenue fairly and honestly. The Bll was then read a second time. MARREED WO?BB RE'VERIONARY TEREST BILL I Thrd.fONTEAGLE, in moving the second reading of this Bill, said that a meare of this kid had passed the Honue o Commnons several times during th3 last few years, and had there met with an almost unanimous support. This was the last night for the second reading of Bflls in thefr lorshipf' House, and he wished to state that he had recelved)' suggestions from noble and learned lords for improving the provisions of this measure He proposed,therefore, now to read the Bill a second time, then to go into committee and amend the Bill, and afterwards to tae the discussion upon the measure in it amended shape. He hs& been in comnmunication with several law lords .ot niow present on the subject of the Bill, and they had expressed themselves strongly in ita favour. Some years ago a change with respect to the property of married woomen was made by the introduction of the Fines and, Recoveries Act, which was founded upon the reporb of a commission of inquiry. That Act was accompanied by pro-: visions to guard against abuse; and every power whioh he now proposed to grant by this Bill in regard to the personal property of inarried women was already given in regard to their real estate. The statte Laktely passed upon the recommendation of experienced and enlghtened commissioners had been carried into effect without giving rise to any oom- lait; and therefore on the ground of nalogy the present till had claim to their lordshipse spport. On what prin- ciple could they refuse to r-ried women interested ' in the reversion of personl proPerty the same power of disposition already conceded to them in respect of their reversionary inerest in real estate X marxied woman entitled to a reversior might dispose of her interest in her husband's lifetune, and yet her nght to the property would revert to her after his death, and would hold good even: against the claim of persons who had given a valuable, consideration for it. Practically speaking. the existence of these contiegencies reatly deteriorated the value of property subject to them, which could be sold only at a considerable loes. Grest hardship s therefore often produoed through the operation of the Ula. It was, indeed, said that under a differeat state of tbings a wl'e might be easily induced by her husband to dispose of properby applicable to the use of her children, who 'would tnereby suffer wrong. But it should be remembered that this measure provided every security agsut such an evil which Row existed in regard to real estate. The noble lord concluded by moving the second resding of the BiLl- Lord ST. LEONARD'S, In rising to oppose the Bill, ex pressed his regret that a Bill of so much importance and involving so great a principle should be brought on for a secondrteading at sola3te a period of the session. This Bill was the thin edge of the wedge, the object of its promoters being to enable a married 'oman to dispose of whaterer reversionary interest she might have in personal estat. A Billof asimihr kind was Introduced into the House of Commons in 1838. He moved its rejection, and it was carried by 57 -votes aganst 2L It was said then, as now, that an interest in real estate was in the power and disposition of a marriAd woman, and it was asked why she should not also be able to dispose of her interest m personul estate ? The answer waa that it was a great blemsing there should be this difference between real and personal estate. Married women had alwayshad the power, undner certain pre - cautions, of disposing of their reversionarv interest in real propert, but real este was generally dealt with after more deliberation, and he wras not prep,ared to change the law in order that aniterest in personal properry might be sold to some of the companies wohich bought reversionary interests. This'waa in fact a Bill to enable dealers in reversions to stripmarried women, of their property, and leave them peunuless ater their husband's death. From the earliest time such a power as was now asked never existed in this I country. It was said that in cases where there was a mar- riage settlement the power given under the Bill was not to' be exercised. Bat the only reason why the promoters of the Bill had not asked for this power at present was because I they weeasure t'he House would not grant it. Suppose a 1 man by his will left his son-in-law certain property, which at the decease of the latter was to pass to the testator's daughter. The testator at present believed, wher he was dying, that he was naking a provision for his daughter, and what could be more reasonable than that she shonld be protected against her husband and her husband's creditors? Who was to provide foT her after her husband's death if he should be able to persuade her to divest herself of the property which her lathet hadi lefther I Their lordaships were asked to sweep away the protection which the law now threw around married women; and for what cause? Where was the hardship of the present law? I was said to be a haauhip that a woman cold not sell that which was valuable. But that was the great benefit of the law, which, for good resons, took care that what a married woman had in rever- i sion she could not part with. The present Bill enabled her . to dispose of this reversion with her husband's consent. But would he not control her when pressed for I money ana urged by his creditors I He need not remind their lordships of the sacrifice at which a reversionary interest was sold. The object was to effect a sale of that which could only be sold at a great deprecietion, but companies were established fer the express purpose of buying reversionary interests, and the moment Parliament passed this Bil there was not a married woman in the kingdom who had a reversionary interest 'who would not be persuaded by her husband to sell it if he were pressed by his creditors. Then when the time came that a woman stood in need of tWis property for herself and children sbe would find that she was left without a shilling. Entertaining these views with respect to the Bill, he should move that it be read a second time that day three months. The LORD CHANCELLOR expressed his approval of the Bill, as calculated to effect a considerable improvement in the existing law, by extevdinf the principle of the free dispostion of property. HEe felt bound, however, at the same time to observe that he could not give his assent to the passing of the Bill unless it were so amended in comnmittee as not to apply to any property which a person might enjoy by virtue of a will of a date previous to the Ist of January, 1858, and so framed as to exclude from its operation any property which a testator might express It to be his vlsh should not be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. Lord CA&UPBELL -was understood to support the prin. ciple which the Bill proposed to carry into effect. The amendment was then negatived without a division, man, the Bill was read a second time. SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS BEFORE JUSTICES 0E THE PEACE BILL. The order of the day for the second reading of this Bill having been read, The Earl of E&1tROWBY took occasion to explain its objeet to be to give increased faciity to suitors who might be dissetisfied with the decision at which justices of the peace, in cases in which they exercised a sumnmary jurisdiction, might arrive, to submit the question at issue to the consideration of a supedor court Lord CO&hPBBLL said, he should not oppose the second reading of the Bill, but expressed his regret that it should have been introduced at a period of the session when it was not likely to receive that amount of attention which its impetance demanded. The Bill was then read a second time. The Boundaries of Bnrghs Extension (Scotland) Bill nd the Jurisdiction in Siatm Bill were IrAe a second tume. Their lordships adjourned shortly after a quarter to 7 O'.lock.

METROPOLITAN POLICE-STATIONS, Jc., BI"L On the order of the day for the third reading of this Mr. COX asked Mr. Speaker to favour the on%se wita his opinion upon the question submitted to him lat night by the hon. member for the Towver Hamlet (Mr Ayrton). whether the Bill, as it related to a grant of meoney, ought not to have been fonnded on a resolution passed in ecom mittee of the whole Hfouse ? The SPBAKER said he had stated lst night-or rather this morning, at 3 o'clock-that it appeared to him, frozm sich attention as he hxd been able to give to the Bill, that it had been properly introduced. Ie . d since had an opportnity of examining the clauses more carefuly, and he found that the 17th and 18th VIotoria, chap. 94, transferred cerhita charges-and among them a charge for the metropolitan polce-from the consolidted fend to the supplics annually voted by Parliament. It was therefore un. ecssary to found this Bill npon resolteions passed in comMr. COX objected to the Bill, which would subject the rtepayers of the metropolis to a heavy charge for building new police-stations, and declured his intention to divide the House. The glleries were cleared for a division, but when the question was put by the Speaker there wa no voice in tbe negative, and the Bll wa accordingly read a thrd time and. passed.

On the motion that the House at its rising adjourn tiU Monday, Mr. ESTCO1JRT, who bad given notice that ho would call the attention of theb ouse to the expediency of facilitating the communication between Great Britain and India i by the route Df the Euphrates, said he had put tbat notice on the paper in thai somewhat irregular form, becauso in trth he bad at that period of the sessionr no other means of bringing it forward, and he had done so af ter communicationawith the noble lord at the head of the Government, who had intimrated his intention to take some part in the discussion that might arise on the subJect. Unfortunately for bi the noble lord, who eknew more about this important subject than any other man in the kingdom. wss uAnable to attend tc-day, and in the oxercise of his discretion ho would therefore postpone it, with the assurance that he would bring it forward the first opportunity. IMISR ENDOWED SCHOOLS. Mr. EKIBEK asked the Chief Secretary for Ireland whether any, and what portion of the evidence taken by the Comnirs6ioners of Endowed Schools (Ireland) had been printed; whether the report would be presented to Her Majesty's Governmnent in November. as had been promised ; and if so, whether It would be published so as to be in the hands of persons interested during the Parliamentary recess? 3. H. HEERBEBRT said, it would be incomplete to present the evidence without the report, and he bolieved the report had been delayed by the illness of one of the comnmnissioners, As the commission expired at the be2inning or November, no donbt every effort would be made to have the report ready by that time. With regard to publishing, he did not think the report could be published before It wapresented to th0 Elouse and he would hold out no hopes of its being published d;Ahg tbe recess. TROOPS FOR 1NDIA. Mr. W. VANSITTArT begged to ask the President of the Board of Control whether Her Majesty's Government intended to send out any additional troops to Bombay and Madras to supply the place of the regiments despatabed from thosb presidencies to Bengal and the North.Westero Provinces? Such was the lawless and disturbed state of thse provinces that he would venture to state, from his ex perience of the country, that it would be impossible to remove any of the troops novw there or on their way there for some considerable time. (Hear.) Ar. V. SMITH said, that since the unfortunate occurrencesin India Her Majesty's Government had sont one regiment and a battalion of the 60th Rifles to replace the regniment which was withdrawn from the Madras Presidenoc during the Crimean war. They had also sent four regipuents to Point de GaUe, to rendezvous until they were sent, at the discretion of the Governor-General, to Bombay, Madras, or Caleatta. BeIides that, the directors of the East India CompAny had applied to Her Majesty's Government, and Her Majesty's Government had complied with the request, to send two regiments of foot to Madras, two Tegiments of foot to Bombiy, and two companies of Foot LArtlery to each presidency. The 3d Dragoon Guards were also eent to Bombay. He hoped the hon. member would boe satisfied thbat, although the troops in the presidencies of Madras and Bombay had shown themselves to be stanch and faithfnl, Her Majesty's Government had not meglected to provido <neen's troops for those presidencies. (Hear, hear.) THE CONTSOIrDATION STATUTES. Mr. HARDY wished to know what course the Goveonment intended to take with regard to the eight Consolidation Bills of the Statute Lar Commissioners? He did notwish to diseuss those Bills, but he thought therews a fatal defect in them,that they did not repeal exlstingenactsnents, so that all Acts not absolutely inconsistent with those Bills would still be in force, and persons wishing to ascertain the law would have to consult the previoas Acts before they could rely on the Co,solidation Statutes (Hear.)

LOZ7DOR, STUJRDAY. AUGUST e, 1957. I In the House of Lords last night several Bills were forwarded a stage, after which their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Common, at the early sittirg, which was very short, the three New Zealand Bills and the Metropolitan Police Stations, &c. Bill were read a third time and passed, after a short conversation. Other Bills were forwarded a stage. In the evenmg, on the motion for adjoumnment until Monday, Mfr. V. S8m (in reply to Mr. W. VA2NSMART) stated that Hvn AJt sTr's Government had sent out additional troops to Bombay and Madras. Other questions were asked relating to the incongruous subjeeta of endowed schools in Ireland, the chimney-pota ulpon Somerxet- ouae,n& hej~ tion in t;t. Jalaea'a Palac too$sbvte.tbe, 00a,a - veniences attending crowded drai oomu ,>t ; Themotion for adjournmeftaspd to; The Dunbar Harbour iBr;vvm time and passed. The House then went again into oonirlte ,onp the Divorce ald Matrinsonial see BID, bXiihg.; with the 16th clause. The 1'th clause, which enacted. thnat wer aife is deserted by her husband for a y.a , a!is miui- t ung berself by her ov 4ind ty, Ie ' . property BhaU be proteaed, by ZPSppiwi4 1, a JUG-. tice of the peace, gave rise to much di _ - Sir E.

Lzowbs29, and, in his opinion, could hot be carrieiato dlot Hle proposed, therefore, that the clsiie shoufld }be omitted, as well as the next clause, 'whiolh i4s coninected wth it, and he pledged himself to aubttut. a. consolidated clause embodying the same' prin. ciple. 4/ The two clauses were thereupon negativei. On the 19th clause, which enacts that any huxband or wife ray petition the Uourt forw -judicis separation on the ground of desertion1 and that t1he Court may decree such judicial separtion, Mr. BuTr moved to give the same jurisdiction to tihe County Courts. TZhe ATromm-G=ERAL objected to giv an inferior tribunal power to decide questions o the greatest importance, involving grounds of divorces to be determined by the uperior tribunaL le had no objection, he said, to clothe County Courts with authority to decree juldicial separation in caserhere the husband did not appear, or, if he did ppear the issue did not involve ratters which would found . decree of divorce a, ricio. Such questions ihould not be dealt with in C summary manner. Lord J, ANss suggested that the nestion of local jurisdiction woufld be better rfised.by an en-. largenieat of the terLus of the asmendament, and he proposed to substitute the words " or any Court hereafter authorized by this Act." Mr. BUTT adopted this suggestion, and sufer4e his amendment to be negatived. The amendnerntof Lord J. M-&~s was then put, when Sir G. Gunv objected to its vaguene. It proposed, he said, to give jurisdiction to courts not in etence; the only local courts rwere the County Coulrts, and their gency had just beenunanimously condenmed. Upon a division the Government were left in a minority of 11; the ayes, for the amendment, being 98, the noes 87. This decision gave occasion, in the dicuion of the subsequent clauses, at intervals, to a controversy as to whose province it was to prepare a scheme of local jurisdiction, some members insisting that it was the function of the Arrox -GzElia, who, on the contrary, seemed to think it properly belonged to Lord J. MIRSz or Mr. uTr to give effect to their own proposaL The lItter, at length, consented to undertake the office. The 24th clause,-another introduced by Lord St. LSOwA1D'S,-providing for the return to cohabitation of parties judicially separated, wa abandoned by the ArrowazY-GzNzE!,, and negatived. On the 25th clause, which specifies the offences for which a petition for a divorce a vinco was presentable by a husband and a wife respectively, Mr. flausOnIoD moved to amend the clause so as to remove the distinctions between them, and place husband and vwife upon a footing of perfect equality. This amendment elicited a long discussion, in the course of which Mr. GLADSTONi reviewed the whole operation of the Bill, and said that, driven to a choice between the mischief of adding to the number of cases of divorce a oiwu>Zo on the one hand, and the maishief on the other of writing on the statute-book the principle of inequality, he should support the amendment. DE. WIGRBX opposed the amendment, and con. tended that the clause under discussion was fraughtt with extreme danger to the morals of society. After speeches from Mr. BuaoNs, Sir W. HEr . COTE, and Mr. W4PrOzn, the Committee divided, and MIr. Dausrsros9 amendment was rejected by, 126 against 65. The C nUAsMU then reported progress, and ob. tained leave to sit again on Tuesday. The House resumed, and, having disposed of some other business, adjourned at 2 o'clock.
The Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill, as 4 piece of legislation, is remarkably simple, naturalj and unpretending. It is so, if not to a fault, af least so far as to lay it open to many attacks on this particular score. A swarm of opponents buzzes about on all sides, sometimes assailing the front, as if to stop it gatogether; sometimes the rear, as if to quicken its pace, inflicting all Idnds of invectives and suggestions, as if out of patience with its dull working character. When a clause is read, half a dozen orators call on the ATTonszGENE.RL to make a demonstration, to envelope the simple words with some ornamentalmyatery, and give a text for controversy where, in the Bill, there is' none. The Court must bo more numerous, morecomplex, more various, and, above all, itinerant, if not ubiquitous. It must do more; it must give damages; it must bring divorce home to the poor man's door; it must do what all the existing laws have done in their perversion, and what they never did in their prime; it must give every man a remedy without even a month's delay; it must expressly anticipate the increase of matrimonial offences, and have a machinery ready for a Prusian average of suits; it must leave no doubts as to the judges who will sit, as to the plaoes-and they must be many-where the Coirt will be held. Such are the demands hailed on the ATToiy= GEN,R.kL and the HIoMs SucRurAny, the former goaded now and thenx into sarcasm, the latter offering only common sense reduced to its most naked sirplicity. The advocates [of divorce for t-he million, who now complain that the Bill is not "as -ide as a church-door" and hardly contemplates any increase of adultery, incest, cruelty, and desertion, are the men who the other day were preaching at the top of their voices that marriage was indissoluble, that a divorce was a natioual sin, and that the existing practice, profane, scandalous, barbarous, unehristian aa it is, was nevertheless better than the Bil befoe the House. The result must have been rather wearisome to the unfortunates who, after a morning citting and official business besides, had to sit on, as it turned out, from 6 o'clock on Thurday evening til 3 the next morning. Nlor do we think the public found the record of these nine hours very edifying or amusing; but they at least illustrate the superiority of natural over theoretical legislation,-that is, of law charitably, remounably, and most lawfully adapted to the facts of the case, over that Idad of law which rather rejoices in putting the facts of the case out of the question atogetber. In this matter of sins agint the marriage law the facts of tho cas appeal to the observation and the feelings of us all. There are numerous instances in which there is an actatl divorce in feeling and in fact; in which the breach is utter and irremediable, and no one in his xm could expect or even wish. it repaired. It rmay not be easy to lay down any geneal irules, but there iz seldom any difficuilty in pronouncing of this or that caue 'whether A reconciliation is to be expected or desired. In' a very low clas, where the' feelingii haie' ROAi< blunted by vicious auociationa;dh4i o they can hardly be id ever.to hsv6existed, it1aysometimes be the least of two eviU tliat ' i d I~~~~~~ ~~~ ...-. , ..', -~
A week ago Lord BIOuGlIAX foand an occasion for delivering a speech ou the expected Reforn Bill. The ex-member for Yorkshire, the ancellor of 1830, naturally regards the revival of discussions on the representative system with the half-sympathetic and half-contemptuous feeling which some old Peninsular General may have entertained when, after forty years of peace, the Guards embarked for the Dardanelles. The colours are tho same, although a third or fourth generation Of cruits has taken the place of the seasoned soldiers who crossed the Pyrenees. The veteran sees with pleasure that the interests of his youth are reviving; but he takes care to remind his younger contemporaries that they are not yet equal to their fathers. The agitation for "the " Bil, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill" will assuredly not be reproduced in 1858. The hopes and fears which will be excited by any change which may be proposed are comparatively moderate and calm. Lord BRoUGoAn'S successor will have no occasiona to implore the Rouse of Lords on his beaded knees to pass Lord PA1nsnRSTON'S RTeformBill. The inmediate reason for introducing such a measure consists in the fact that it has been repeatedly announced, and that almost all considerable statesmen and a majority of the House of Commons are pledged to support a change. Lord J. RUSSELL was with difficulty persuaded to withdraw his Bill in the midst of the Russian WYar, and he is ready at any moment to take the lead of the Reforming party, if the Government shows any want of zeal in the cause. At the general election it was imposible to confine candidates and constituenciea to the immediate issue between Lord PAiuxasToy and his opponents. In a large number of boroughs P3eform was made the test of Liberalism, and the temperate desire for change which is partially entertaineed was loudly and universally expressed. The country and its rulers have been led by circumstances to make a kind2of compact among themselves, and it would be rash, and scarcely honest, to treat the bargain as a nullity. Communities as well as individuala feel themselves bound to act up to a resolution when they have once publicly announced it. The business of wise politicians at present is not to thwart the popular demand, but to make use of it for the puspose of strengthening and purifying the representativo system. Lord BRouoxGHAX need not deprecate the renewal of revolutionay excitement. The Reform Bill of 1831 waa a train applied to a powder mine. There is no mass of combustible materinis underlying the present poition of pcditical society in England. Rotten borougha, close Corporations, Corn Laws, and Navigation Laws have disappeared, and, above all, the swpicion that public evils are to be attributed to the legidation of a sellish minority has happily become obsolete. There may be errors and abuses still to correct, but there is no indignant feeling of disaffection Among the great body of the community. The advance of prosperity and of enlightenment in the lsst quarter of a century has been so visible and rapid that the popular imagination is not forced to employ itself in creating a future TJtopia, or in looking back to a fictitious age of gold. Even the most thoroughgoing advocates of organic change demand rather a logical symmetry in the representative system than a nachinery adapted to the realization of extensive social reforms. By a natural consequence, the old spirit of bigoted resistance to ilnprovement has almost disappeared with the subsidence of revolutionary agitation. There never was a time at which the correctior of constitutional irregularities might be more safely undertaken. The difficulty of the Government vill consist principaUy in the absence of enthusiasm for any definite scheme which may be proposed. The mneasure -which obtains the sanction of the ablest politicians may perhaps not be calculated to satisfy the popular expectations. The constituencies at the general election probably desired a considerable extension, of the suffrage, and it will be necessary to carry ont their wishes. On the other hand, all statesmen worthy of the name will be unanimous in resisting proposals for uniformity of representation. The admission of the higher and more enlightened class of non-voters will meet with universal approval; but it unfortuliately happens that in proportion to any man's rank in society is his indifference to the Parliamentary franchise. The upper classes must neces'sarily form a small minority, and it is not through the influence of their individual votes that they contrive to govem the country. The borough constituencies, especially in the laTger towns, are already too homogeneous. Small tradesmen outnumber the more educated portion of the middle classes, while the active and intelligent artisans are for the most part excluded from the franchise. If some plan can be devised for enabling the manufacturing operatives to vote, without swamnping the remaining bodies of electors, the economic errors which embody themselves in ' unions" and in " strikes" may soon be eradicated by the influence of free discussion. The Lancashire factory hands might possibly, in the first instance, return a few Socialist demagogues to Parliament, but experience would rapidly convince them of their error; and the consciousness that they had a voice in the councils of the nation would go far to anticipate their periodical outbreaks of discontent. It must not be forgotten that the total armount of electoral power is necessarily a fixed quantity. Nothing can be given to one class but what is ta'ken away from another. New seats can be created only by the cisfranchisement of smal boroughs. Large additions to existing constituencies will swamp the present electors. At the time of the Reform Bil it was comparatively easy to transfer power from a score of noblemen to some dozens of counties and of large towns. The elective bodies of the present day are more powerful than the boroughmongers, inasmuch as they occupy a less anomalous position. The disfranchisement of fifty small boroughs would unite seventy or eighty members in opposition to the promoters of any reform measure. If Lord JoHNr Rx sszLL's Bill had passed a second reading in 1854, it was generally understood that the disfranchising clause would be rejected by a large majority. It may be doubted whether any powerful class is really eager for a specific change. The gentry manage the counties; the Liberal manufacturers have no rivals in the large towns. The electors in the minor boroughs can scarcely wish to reduce the importance of the suffrage by sharing it with a larger number. Yet there are advantages to those who know how to use them in the opportunity of navigating in a calm. A well-considered measure, pressed on with all the vigour of Government, will command the aid of those numerous members who are Fledged to do something, a;nd at a loss to decide among competing projects. There is no reason to fear Mr. DisRanu's protest on behalf of the illtreated counties, for his Conservative supporters are wel aware that they can only lose by any attempt to make representation coincide with property and with numbers. If London, carrying out the samne principle, demands sixty or seventy members, the provinces will not fail to support the Government in repudiating a mischievous uniformity. The Liberal majority will overbear any obstinate resistance to improvement, and a large portion of its members will, at the same time, be ready to support the Minister against any rash and dangerous innovation. The result wM undoubtedly involve an increase of popular power, but no considerable section of tho community demands a serious derangement of the balance of the constitution. The electoral body muat itself, in a certain sense, represent the collective nation. If it once becomes identical with the multitude, all the more enlightened classes are practically disfranchised.
The Reports of the Railway Companies are now appearing. The London and North-Western announces 5 per cent. as the rate of the dividend for the half-year. The London and South-Western announces 40 per cent., the Chairman honeying his " retrogressive' dividend with various apologies and explanations to make it go down as easily as possible-in short, pronouncing it to be " not a "bad dividend," though confessing that " it is "distasteful to receive less than was expected." The truth is, 5 per cent. iz no bad dividend on the main lines when the branch lines pay nothing. But what, after all, does it come to-this poor 5 per cent. from main line and no per cent. from branch lines? Why, simply to this,that we are paying for our convenience. We cannot intersect the whole area of the country with railways, and expect all to pay 10 per cent. That was the first dividend of the London and Birningham, and the profits of railways were limited to that by Act of Parliament;-a very needless legisative precaution, as it turns out. But, as we have just said, we have, after all, our quid pro quo for it. We have the full convenience of a great railway networknot three or four trunk lines, the result to which our neighbours on the Continent have hitherto limited their efforts, but a network of railways which brings the convenience home almost to every man's door. It was simply impossible that this should pay as a speculation-we mean, taking the railways of the country as a 'whole, that they should repay the shareholders as a body. But we wanted the convenience, we could afford to pay for it, and we have paid for it. Sir ROBERT PEEL was much criticized for not checking the mania for near railways, and, certainly, when that economising statesman and national censor, who was always holding us in and rebuking our forwardness, turned up the first sod of the Trent Valley Line, the Temark was obvious that he was giving a stimulus to this movement instead of repressing it. But, after all, looking it the affair with our present eyes, we must see that it was simply impossible to check the progress of railways, because, according to the ideas of people in this country, one railway necessitated another. A trunk necessitated a branch, and every new railway landed at every five miles an impatient traveller, anxious to get to his destination from the railway as quickly as the railway brought him. Three or four great trunk lines were enough to ,uggest new relations of place to place over the 'Whole area of the cou4try. With what impatience does even a small town of 2,000 ppople bear its ltance of three or four miJ6% from the next station I The omnibus 9f the George, or the Angel, or the S .aeen's Head may not convey more than hall a dozen passengers daily to and from the railway, but the spirit of the place groans under the sbackle. What a nuisance to have to go all this way backwards and forwards I Blow much behindhand we are ! flow we are letting the rest of the world get before us I n this way the town of Applemarket or Churehltoke feels itself fettered, its mettle depressed, and its neck underneath the foot of its enemies and oppressors, so long as there is a malignant interval bf four miles between it and the nearet station. Its spirit rise some fino day, a comppany is formed, it is alleged that there are in the place three considerable brewers, besides a tanner and a papermaker, -whose custom will support a branch; a company is formed, and it is considered' patriotic to take shares. Rlailways, in short, make us impatient of anything but railways. The faster our ordinary pace is, the more we rebel against a slow pace. Even on the railway itself all stoppage is felt with tenfold acuteness, and tbe coneitent and developed railway traveller abominates every train but an express. Indeed, it becomes, not only a point of. convenience, but a point of honour, to arrive at a place by the very quickest transit. Every minute is grudged, not only as a delay, but as a stigma, and an additional quarter of an hour is, a disgrace under which he burns at least for the rest of the day. So full is travelling of keen refinements and sensibilities the instant we throw our souls into it. It is not a mere utilitarian process. Base thought ! No; it is a much deeper thing; it has a sphere of sentiment of its own, its code of honour, its ideal standard. There is sublimity in speed. We want to annihilate space. The victory is glorious iu itsif, and our ambition makes us irritable and senitive. The traveller is proverbially the most impatient animal in existence, and the railway traveller is the moat impatient of travellers. His nerves are strung up to a high pitch, and are therefore so much the more susceptible of a jar. There iz an aid, moreover, to the formation of branch lines and the multiplication of railways in. the absorbing policy of the trunk lines. Here is a case before us in the report of the London and South-Western. The new proposed line from Wimbledon to Epsom was opposed by the South-Western till " it became obvious that it would be carried. " They considered then that the line might be " worked inimically to the company, and "thought it right to form some arrangement " with the promoters so as to obtain some power " over it." The arrangement is that the SouthWestern takes 1,500 shares, and is represented by two Directors at the new Company's board. If a place, then, can only manage to get up a fair list of persons ready to take shares in a new railway and push on the scheme a certain way, it can coLut ultimately on the solid assistance of the neighbouring trunk line, which it will be able to annoy, unless the latter by shares possesses itself of a controlling power over it. Thus the inclusive policy of the trunks, apprehensive of " inimical working" in the minor lines if they stand by themselves, helps to the formation of the new line, and the loss, whatever it is, of this new line as a speculation is shared between the purse of the locality and the purse of the trunk line. With all the extraordinary convenience and facilities, however, of our network of railways, there is one considerable inconvenience which arises from eo many companies having to share the profits, and that is, that the attendance at the great stations is not always as good as it ought to be. The principal stations on some lines are very conspicuously defective in their staff of porters, so much so as actually to interfere with the travefleres progress on his journey. He consults his Bradsh'sw, and sees that his train arrives at such a "junction" a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before another traini leaves it, and he considers himself safe to get on by the latter train. He arrives in timae, bat while one or two porters are feebly contending with a large pile of luggage, which the train that has brought him has thrown out upon the platform, the traina for which he had destined himself has vanished, and he has to wait for the next. This is a natural result of the too thin attendance at some of our stations. The diffilculties of the companies struggling for scanty profits amid such great competition are, of course, some excuse for a defective staff of servants ; but, if companies are excused, the fact only shows that our railways have so far outrun their resources, and that we have too many to keep quite effectively [and adequately administered. The Board acts with the bugbear of the shareholders perpetually before it.

Tin RAILwAx CoLLisiowN AL& HfULL.-The adjourned inquest on the body of John Yates, of Cottingham, near Hull, who lost his life in a railway collision on the 24th nt., -was held before Mr. J. J. Thorney at the Town-hall, Hull, on Wednesday lst The par. ticulars of the case have already been stated in T'he and it will be remembered thst a goods train ran into a passenger train at a portion of the North-Eastern line near Hull, where the aull and aelby, the Hull and.Bridlington, and the Victoria Dook linesunite. The collisionwas of a severe chArkter, and uany persons were conuiderably injured, but only the deceased lost his life. Thi evidence went to show that there had been a good deal of habitual neglect of the rules of the company, and that the death of the deceestd was clearly at. tribetable to such neglect. Tho jury retuned a verdict to the effect that John Yates came to bis death by a collision between a goods and passenger train on the 24th of July, and that George Tolson, the driver of the goods tain, was guilty of manslaughter. The jury alsorecommendedthat to prevent any fature accidents the railway authorities ahould alter their points at or n-ar the Victoria junction, sa that he Victoria gooos trains shoueld not have to pass on the -assengerlEme of the West Parade jnuction, or that the ail nd Selby line and the Hull and Brldllngton line be m{.ade distint Lines till they pas the pest-house.lane cro3sing.

$ECnUOND EDITION, TBH IJB&OSFICOE, uSrday fornFngg. MPRESS FROM PARIS; The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Friday), 6 p.. - A private letter from Vienna, of the 4th, mentions that the vst of the Emperor Napoleon to Osborne -seems to produce a certain degree of dissatiefaction at the Imperial Court. lt is regarded as an indica. tion that not only has the Anglo-French alliance undergone no sensible diminution, whatever diffe. rences mayhave arisen on points which arenow settled, but that it Is as intimate as ever, and, if anything, will be drawn still closer. It is anticipated that concesions on other questions which still divide the two Cabinets will be mutually made, and that the English Government, in proof of itg desire to remain on the same friendly terms with ter powerful ally; may not refuse to withdraw her1 opposition to the uniona of the Danubian PrIncipaties, -and wraich, all things considered, is one of secondary interest to her. The Absolute Sovereigns of Europe, we are told, regard with distrast and jealodsy this alliance; it is useless for Ausia to try to cultivate the good graces of England, and the party that always showed its hostiluty to the poicy of the Western Powers now suggests the necessity of a reconciliationwithRusia, who, after al, is Austria's flatural ally. The question of the Principaliti.e is considered as a good opportunity for.that purpose. Thussia is believed to desire the union under the sovereignty of a native Prince, for the simple reason that a native Prince would be easily attached to her interests, artd that before long the provinces would be really governed, as they have been so long, under Ru8sian influence. In the event of a union, which Austria has always considered hurtful to herself, sbe would try to neuttraize the danger by the nomination of a German Prince, which might be accepted as a pis aUer by Russia. Both Powers, however, are hostile to the noimination of a French Prince of the Imperial family, andFrance, in pushing forth the union, they think is actuated by no other motive. The nomination would fall on Prince Napoleon, who is knowvn for his more than favourable disposition towards England, and for his dislike to everything Russian,as proved in the mostunmistakeablemanrer during the visit oftthe Grand Duke ZConstantine to France, aind his little partiality to German Princes or Gelman politics. It would appear that the Archduk-e, during his sojourna in England, endeavoured to ascertain whether a visit from his Imperial brother, the Emperor of Austria, would be viewed with pleasure by the English Court or the English peoppl. That visit would be considered to show to Europe the good understanding that existed between Austria and England, andwouidbe the precursor of a still closer friendship. If the writer of the lbtter be well informed,it would seem that the Archduke's advances were not received so warmly as he anticipated In the quarter to which they were addressed. The English people, he was told. are rather demonstrative in their preferences and their dislikes-too demonstrative, perhaps, to sUit the strict notions about etiquette entertained in the old Court of the continent. It would be extremely painful if the Emperor of Austria met with a les hearty or leus enthusiastic reception than the Ernperor of the French, and the English people, w,ho are suppozed to have a prescriptive title to eccentricity, might be so unreasonable as still to bear in mind that while they were bearing the brunt of the battle before Sebastopol, and pouring out their blood and their treasure in a cause in which Austria was as deeply interested as themslves, Prance and England itood side by side, while ALustria, calling herself the ally of both, prudently kept aloof. Then. ag&su, there were other passages, connected with the funeral of the Duke of Welington, kc., which, it was feared, have not yet been effaced from the English maind, which In such things is very tenacious.c The high qualities of the Emperor Francis Joseph were done justice to, buit the people at large had, unfortunately, a decided preference for a bold, straightforward policy over an excessively cautious one, and had the bad habit of not concealing their preferences. Something more passed on the occasion, which the writer of the letter in question does not particularize; but the upshot Was that the idea of a visit from the Emperor of Austria was laid aside for the moment. It produced, how- I ever, an unpleasant impression in the Court circles of Vienna, and the Russian party have not failed to turn it to advantage. What success any advan,es of Austria towards Russia will have time only can tell. The Queen of Greece is also said to be very active in this generous labour of bringing once more together old friends who have been so rudely separated, and one of Whom has not yet paid the heavy debt! of gratitude incurred during the Hungarian war. Her Majesty is said to have pleaded very warmly the cause of her brother of Oldenburg, in the matter of the succession to the throne of Greece, in the event of the Bavarian Prince deciding that even Athens is 3not worth apostacy. Should "he contribute towards the reconciliation of the two Courts it would be an additional triumph. M. Thouvenel, the Frenchl Ambassador at Con-a stantinople, who had cbtained leave of absence to return to France on family business, will not quit his post until after the new elections in Moldavia. A private telegraphic despatch from Vienna, received to-day, announces that the French Anmbas sador at Constantinople had pulled down his flag in consequence of his demands not being granted by the Porte. I am assured that the French Government gives a positive contradiction to this state. ment, and has, moreover, desired that the Paris papers should not repeat it, on the ground of its 'naccuracy. Another private telegraphic despatch from London states that a " conference" is to be held this evening at Osborne, at which Lord Palmerston, Lord Clarendon, M. de Persigny, and M. Walewski will assist. General Bourbaki, who commanded a brigade during the lat campaign in Kabylia, has arrived in Paris on leave granted by the Minister of War. The brother-in-law of M. Eugene Sue has left for Aannecy, to bring back the remains of the late novelist, 'Which are to be interred at Parls. It is announced that the steam cutter Pelican, to the command of which the son of Admiral Hamelin, Minulterlof Marine, is appointed, will craize off the coast of Gascony, between Bayonne aad Biaritz, during the sumer. The King of Wurtemberg, the Bayonne journals announce, has arrived at Biaritz. The Gazette de Lyon publishes a letter from a landed proprietor of the neighbourhood of that city, giving some interesting details relative to the present harvest. It says - " As my corn has now been threshod, I am able to say something about ths years produce. My crop, which con. siste principally of wheat, gives me an augentattion over 1866 of 75 per cent. The intelligence which I roceive from diffezent quarters leaves no doubt in my mind that in many places the yield is double what it was last year; but in order to be free from all exaggeration, I wil estimate the harvest of 1857 as only 50 per cent. above that of 18. Ac. cording to political economists, France needs every year for the bread of all her ihabitants 110 million hectolltres of corn of all kInds, er about 3 hectolitres per hed. In the year 1856 there was a deficiency of 7 million hectolitres, 'which was made'up by the introduction of foreign corn. Fr=oe consequently produced 103 milions of hectolitres of breadstuffs, and, bY the aid of private enterprise and of railway communication,whatformerly wonldhaveanmounted abmost 'to a famine, was nothing more than a not very marled sarcity. In order to be more safe in my calsulations, T will take only at 100 railliots the yield of 1856; and, as that of 1857 gives 50 per oent. of augmentation, itg Vroduce wiU be 150 zniUions of hectolitres, or 40 nioips. inore than France require3. That exeass will, without adoubt, find its way to Switzerland and EnglAnd, and part wil be used up for distillation. But 40 iiRions of hectol;tre. is a very considerable surplus, and will leave a large rnargin to prepare for any futwre defcdenoy. The wheat of 1857 3s much finer and heavier than that of the preding year; and ray own gives totheheotolitre ?OOg0 Ammes (r early 11 lb.) more than in8I6. But that addlhion multiplied by O150,000,0 furnishes a. quantity F rEc 5vhenonsdre closely, isreallyinmmense. And][ loo Ftc ircresewhtich I mentiou as below the averagefor this reason, that my land being of the first quality yield comparatively less this year than second and third rate f rs, where the yield is uncommol fine; so much so indeed, that the argillo-siiious landioi the Biesse has prodoerd as7 fine corn this sear as the argillo-calcareous distriote on the banks of the 6aones Taddng allthese cir cunmstances into consideration, I do aot fear to announce that ithe ha,rvest will tur out even better than wras at first The tria of the thre Italian conspirators, Tibaldi Bortolotti, and Grilli, was resumed this morning at 10 o'clock, before the Court of Assize of PAriS. The court was more crowded to-day than yesterday. Tibaldi was more pale and rmless, and addressed several questions to the gendarmeat his side. Grill, who entered next, appeared much dejected. Bortolotti appeared to be perlectly at his ease, slid gazed earnestly at the strangers in the galleries. The President having taken his seat, the AttorneyGeneraI rose to speak to evidence; his speech-wa in a great measure a recrpitulation of the bill of indictmenb. " Thank God," xaid the Attorney.. General in conclusion, "the part those conspiratore had to ill is concluded. Oar duty is accomplished. It is for you, gentlemen ol the jury, to .perform yours with the independence and firmness which belong to honourable and free men." N. Deamarets then pleaded for Tibald4 and endeavoured to convince the jury that there was no evidence to convict his client but the unsupported declaration of his fellow-prisoners. MI. Ploquet, second counsel for Tibaldi, submitted to the Court that it should be proposed to the jury that, even supppsing the facts charged in the indictment against Tibaldi to be proved, as his fellowconspirators did not consent to execute the crime, he must be acquitted. M. Liacan spoke in defence of Gril. lle demanded the acquittal of his client on the ground that he had never intended to assasinate the Emperor. Re had never even seen Bis Majeiiy, norhad he ever gone out armed. M. Lecanu followed for Bortolotti, aud pursued the same line of argument. The Attorney-General shortly riplied, and the President was reading his notes to tih jury when your reporter was forced to leave the Court in consequence of the hour for closiug the post being at hand.* The following private telegraphic despatches have i been received- " MARSEILLES, AUG. 6.

(FRoM a.1 000Ah1Oi{M 00 OiDi.) CONSTATLIOPLE, JOnY 30.I Constnntinoyile appears to be the chosen battle. field of diplomacy. Every now and again we are called upon to witness stern fights, wherein littleI blood is spilt but very much inlc, and wherein all| the aggresslve and annoying means of whclh ArmbasFadors dispose are largely brought into playdiplomatic notes, protests, ultimatums, delaying of mails and sometimes packing up, threatening to gogoing. The Sultan's Ministers are, of course, always the party attacked, but, although the aggressors have changed each time, there never has beenanychange in the staunch friend who has always stood by them, and enabled them to resist the rnea- sonable demands of diplomatic tiros, anxious to gainl their spurs on this memorable field. What there is in the air of ostantnople which 9Iies to the brein Of young diplomats and inspires them with so mech ardour, I cannot presume to say, but alas ! I oould namxe more than-one promising ambassador who,has fallen a victim to this bnefuliufluence, and another has just been seized with all the symptoms which precede a rapid dissolution; and yet it Is eay to escape, by adhering strictly to the trite maxun, -never meddle with what is not your business. When the Congress of Paris lately recog. nized the Ottoman empire as a member of the European family, it seems at the amme time to have thought proper that it should undergo a term of tutelage and probation before it was left to Itself, and as a part of this system, I suppose, a commission wau appointed to watch the exeation of certain measures to be adopted in that part of the empire known as the Danubian Principalities. A. great question soon arose-za U these Prinnipalities bo left separated, as they have been from time immemorial, or shall they be united y-end, naturally enough, It was agreed that the wishes of the people should be taken iato account; that the Sultan and his Government should have an opinion and a wish in a matter which concernIs san iportant portion of the Ottoms empire, and that this , vr telegrapbic aesto1 in snother oolumn. - bpinioki hnd'this wishL should bot5'liia the ancient order of iingean' be easily understood.: Bat, it appears ta' some of the Europcan Powers, and France at their`1iead' Wbvei also an opinioin wliiehi they, aro &oU ` ied pose; not oly on the'lold 6W a lchi,therle,I. but also o]the Porte 'and onthe Sultan.

VIENN~A, AUUoSTs 5. The Ost-Deutsce Post, which is in the habit of expressing the opinions of the Austrian Foreignoffice, contains a leader on the recent conduct of .the French Govenent towards Turkey, which will hardly be to the taste either of Count WalewsId or of the Emperor N!apoleon. According to the paper in question, that which Erance now so peremptoril7. requires from the Sultan is the revocation of bis own decree in a matter of internal administration and complete submis.sion to the will of a foreign Power. " These," says the Ost-Deutsohe Post "are more arbitrary, despotic, and iflsultingdenianda than were made by Russia when her Protect rate was in all'its glory." It ic still my opinion that the unfortunate Porte will be obliged. "to cat dirt," atthough tha assurance has this morning been given me that Asli Pasha, the present Minister for Foreign Afairs, "isg firmnly resolved 'not to sacrifice the dignity of his Imperial master." It is somewhat sinificant that one of the Sultan's su-lbjects a fewv hours since advisedme to readAtcle 8 of the Treaty of Mrch 30, 1856. It runs as followes: "I f any disageement mnenacing the mainenance of their relations sholId aise between the Sublime Porke and one or seeralg of the other Powrers, the Sublimeo Porke and each of those Powers shall, before they have recourse to foro%. put the other contracting parties in a position to obviate such an extremity by mean of their m3edition." The public is unable, to conceive why the Fren42( Government should be so extremely desirous lX bring about the union of Mioldavin and Wallachia1 and the diplomatic world appears to be qelte ss much in the dark as the publio. Positive information has been received here that Lord Redehiffe has n tot the most distant idea of q uitting Constantinople at such a critical moment. It is hardly worth while that England should quarrel with France about the Moldavian elections, for no one doubts that a repetition of them would lead to the very Eame remit. The VienBna Presse insinuates that the XFrench Government would hardly employ sulch peremptory language towarde the Porte if the attention of E3ngland were not so greatly occupied by India. The Oestcrreichieche Zeitwng,) which is the property of a company of Trieste capitalists, says that Austria us so desirouls that the plan of M. Lesseps should be. r.ealized, " because «he greatly -wishes to opens direct trade with India." As was said in a former letter, the two Powers which would derive the greatest advantage from a water communication between the Mediterranean and the Red SeaU are Austria aind Greece. Inl order that the world may have an opportunity of convincing itself that the wy by Trieste is the shortest road from the west of Europe to India, the Austrian Iloyd will mmediately forward the letters and newvspapers brought by its steamers from Alexandria to their destinationL Yesterday afternoon the Arhdu2ke Ferdinand Mxlian and the Archduchess Charlotte arrIved by steamer from Liaz and proceeded at once to the palace at Sch6nbrunn.

TEB BMPBEOR OP THE F2NCWH AT OSBORNB. PORTSMOUTEI, FnRZAy. Ia pite of the greedy anxiety which is manifegted on all sides to ascertain the least clue to the movements of the Court and their Imperial guests, nothing is allowed to transpire. The secret is keDt, like the secret of Freemasonry, because there is really nothing to tell, for, as we stated yesterday, the visit is most strictly private, and, 'with the exception of short trips in the Royal yacht, neither the Emperor nor Empress is likely to quit the island at all. The weather, unfortunately, has turned wet, cold, and unfavourable, so that the natural inducements to remain quietly at Osborne are materially augmented. We have already informed ouir readers that it was just probable that the Emperor would run out in the Royal yacht to Spithead and inspect the James Baines, 'with all her troops on board, before that vessel atarted for Iudia. This probability receives confirnation from the fact of Sir James Scarlett having received instructions to telegraph this afternoon to the Emperor at Oaborne when the James Bfanes and Champion of the Seas, with the troops on board were at Spithead and ready for sailing. Should the weather, therefore, become more favourable and the Imperial visit take place at all, it will either be this evening or early to-morrow (Saturday) morning. As it is generally anticipated that Her Majesty will take a trip in the Royal yacht to witness the start of the yachts for the " Queen's Cup" this afternoon, the inspection may tatke place this evening, in order that the ship? may sail at daybreak1 but the weather nowr seems much against a vist. One of our oontemporaries, which profeses togive an account of the incidents connected with the arival of the Emperor and Empresa, states that,- " As the Prinoe Consort approached the Imperial yacht, tho Emperor, in his anxiety to greet his Eoyal Ighness, ascended the paddlebox, and on stepping down hastily to xneet the Prince the Emperor missed his footing and feU violently on t*le deck. His M*aesty was much sh&ken, and grased his face slightly, but, instantly recovering himaelf, warmly embraced the PRice Consort" There is not the leas' foundation for this statement, and our fashionable contemporary, we fear, has fallen a victim to some heartlees joker. No mratter what the anxiety of His Imperial Majesty to welcome Prince Albert, he -would have found a difficulty in manifesting it by " ascending the paddle-box" of the Reine Hortense, since that vessel happens to be a screw. When the Prince Consort came alongside the Emperor waited at the gangway and shook hands with him most cordially,- while little Prince Alfred -was embraced and afFectionately kissed by the Empress. A few moments were occupied in presenting the various members of His Majesty's suite to the Prince Consort, during -which (probably owing to the fatigue of the voyage) none of the illustrious personages indulged in " grazing their faces" or "Cvolent falls on the deck." The same authority, among nunerous other misstatements, adds that "a guard of honour, composed of 50 picked men of the Coldstream Guards, every man's breast glistening with Crimean medals, received the Emperor and Empres on landing at the pierhea" The reception at the pier-head was of such a strictlv private nature that even the guard of hoiour was dispensed with, and none but Her Majesty, the Royal Princesses, Countess Persigny, and the lady in waiting were on the pier. These statements would be unworthy of notice but that they may naturally create doubts as to the accuracy of our reporter, whose account of the very few incidents connected with the reception of their Imperial Majesties, as coming firom the only representative of the preae who had an opportanity of witnessing them, can be inmplicitly depended on. (BY }LCRnIC AND INTERNATION TELEGRAPH.) PORTSUOUTJE, FiunAY EvxKsG. The Emperor and Empress, with Her Majesty, the Prince Consort, and other members of the Royal famrily, embarked on board the Royal yacht at 6 o'clock, to proceed to Cowes, to witness the return of the yachts from the Regatta, and the termination of the race for the Cup. The Royal party returned shortly before 8 o'clock to Osborne. The weather was cold and squally with heavy rain, and the sea at Spithead ran too high to permit a visit to the Livernool clippers. Should the wind go down there is no doubt now that the vessels will be inspected before sailing to-morrow.

THB IV;:IVS FROM INDIA. TO THE EDITOT O-F TUE TIMES. Sir,-In The Times of this morning is a letter from Mr. Fairholme, containing an extract from acommunication from the Bombay Presidency, dated the 23d of June, inUmating that Delhi was known at that date to have fallen Prom tho tenour of the communicatioa the writer is obviously a resldent at Sattara, whom I should have little diffculty in identifying, and communicated the state of matters and of rumours as belioved in at that date Sattars is 200 miles further off from Delhi than Bombay, from which I have letters up to the despatch of the mail on the 1st of July. The ramour given by Mr. Fairholme, as fact, prevalent a week kefore, had by this time become exploded, and Delhi certainly had not fallen up to the 26th of June. Your own correspondent gives the most fol accurate, and recent information on all these subjects, and his letters, so far as they extend, are infinitely more to be relied upon, both in point of Correctness and recency than those of private parties, not actually at the scene of action. My own letters discountenance the ideaG of danger and commotion around Bombay which are now becoming prevalent in this country. Public securities had become affected from no distrust in our credit, bat from the belief that a 6 per cent. loan was about to be opened. So little fear was entertained by the more enlightened capitalists that the West of India Canal Irrigation Company, who had completed their surveys, were only waiting for the sanction of the home authorities of the terms recommended by the Bombay revenue officers, and concurred in by Government, to commence the construction of a caal 90 miles in length. A body of native merchants were equally eager to begin the construction of a tide basin for cotton boats at Bombay, on which they were ready to expend 50,0001. or 60,0001. The belief seemed to be that private enterprie was at prewat more available for carxying on publio works than it ever before had been, without any guarantee or other stinu. lant, or any interferenoe with the arrangemegtg of the administration, if they could only get through with their preliminary correspondence, thzough that monstrous set of " Cireumlocution offices," which stand in the Way of progrss in the East.

A STOBM AT SPA. TO THE, EDITOR OF THE TMS. Sir,-For some time past the weather here has been extremely hot. Yesterday the air was more than usually soltry, thermometer 90 deg. Fahrenheit in the shade. About 10 o'clock am. a cloud of smoke was seen rising in a southerly direction, and it was imtediately presumed that a house was on fire in the hamlet of Creppe, situate on a rising ground about a mile from the town. The town fire engine was instantly despatched, but upon its arrival It was found to be perfectly useless, as, in consequence of the long drought, the place was almoat absolutely deprived of water. By o'lock 28 farmhouses and cottages, with hayrioks, &c., had fallen a prey to the flames. The church was eantL* destroyed. About 7 in the evening I drove out with a few friends to the heights, nea the old race-course, on the Road to Bart, to got a hlt of the fresh air of the hlls. Halting for a few minutes, we vere admiring the distant scenery through a most transparent atmosphere, and a few thin columns of smoke still emerging from the ruins of the devoted hamlrA, when, looking westwards, we observed coming over from the direction of IS Reid a dense black cloud, which came on spreading over Designy, Winannlanche, Marteau, Crie Spa and the place where we hai pulled up; itws whtrlwind of irpalpable dust and noxious exhalation; this pased over in the direction of Bart, having lasted in its course about a quarter of an hour. The atmosphere again becarae bnrght, but the air remained still sultry. This morning the intense heat continued, the sun shining brightly until about 4 o'clock, when suddenly the same black-looking cloud came over Spa from the same direction, and in a few minutes there fell, amid a roar of thunder like the booming of artillery, accompanied by uninterrupted sharp platoon firing, such a ohower of hailstones as no onepresent in this plaee remembers ever to have seen. The shower lasted about ten minutes; the first hailstone8 that fell were of the sizs of grapeshot, then like marbles, mixed with myrlads of others of all shapes and sizes, many of them of the weight of several ounces, the greater number being spherical, nodulated, of a quartz-like aspect, and mesuring uniformly an inch and a-half in diameter. The windows were riddled, as from a dicharge of grapeshot; slated and tiled roofs were perforated as if traversed by shells. Fortunately, the crowds of visitors vt'o are usually in the afternoon riding, driving, or sauntering about the neighbourhood, were just quietly seated at their table d' h6t&z At the Hotel de I'Orange the hail burst through the windows and broke a considerable quantity of glans upon the table, indenting by their violence the silver dish covers at the Hotel de Plandre, a friend of mine standing in his bedroom, upon a travel2ing trnnk, to reach out of the window and close the erkizenes, was struck by a large hilstone on the head anad knocked over.

RoyCz OF TS SEA.-In the Birkenhead Dock I there is now lying as prettya little craft as ever hoisted a sail, the brigantine Union, Captain James Mucklejohn. Connected with this little "plougher of the deep" is a small romance whioh will doubtless be interesting not only to the nautical, but to the general reader. The Union is a model raft, and her commander is ditto a seaman. The peculiarity of the case Is this, that the vessel was built, is commanded, and crowed all by one family; and, moreover, sea service has been rendered by the wife of the master and mother of the crew. Captain James Mucklejohn is a native of Leith, a hardy Scot. Having in his youth to encounter obstacles which ever beset those who aspire to make their way In the world, he resolved to fight with them like a man, and with that determination of action for which his country is so distinguishable he set hinself to work to follow out to success one given course of lite. Like all sensible men, the fDrst want he found to the accomniUshment of the object he had determined upon was a wife, a good one, and he happened to beWortunate in his choice. He enged and consummated with a bonny lass fromInverness. zus domestic position now beiisg settled, he emigrated with her to Prince Edward's Island about 26 years ago. A virtuous marrisge is generally followed by beneficial results. Natural contingencies reslted in this case; the family grew up all sons, and no one family ever appeared to live more happily, not even that in Noah's ark, the beasts of coure excepted. They settled down lf the colony of Prince Edward's Island as farmers, and were prospering. As early aspirations in love lead to disquietude, so does early occupation oftentimes to discontent in position. The father had been brought up as a shipwright, and the sons had been originally taught the same trade. Notwith. standing the beauties of the broad fields and the charms of rural life, a ship to them was more attractive than a farm. " They took counsel together," and determined upon,entering into the shipbuflding trade. Prince Edward's isiand swarms with trees. Their axes went to work, and they hewed them down, A determined course of proeed. ing had now been come to. In process of time they constructed some vessels entirely with their own bands, excot the smith's work, and brought them for sale to LiverpooL These vessels were sold by Messrs. Wilson and Brown, of this port; the first one, the Isabel, of 130 tons, in 1852; in 1853,.the Bee, of 97 tons; and, in 1854, the Succoess, of 230 tons; and, in addition to tho occupation of farming and the art of shipbuilding, the family acquired the rt of seamanship and naigation. Geni, however, is always restless, always endeavouring, and ever ccomplshing. Thia family of unison ha long bad a desire tot their fortunes at thentiodes as f perhaps, the temptations o h odll. fAsrlao e Zealand offered more inducement to the creation of wealth. They therefore came t the determination of lea Prince EdwardB Island. w was this to be acompish in a compact? After a family consultation, the father urged that the only way was to build a ship - the sons agreed with him, and they set to work, and buit, entirely with their own hands, the brigautine Union, and fitted her out expres3ly to convey them to New Zealand. They launched her at Prince Edward's Islnd on the 22d of May, 856, and saed on the 24th of the next month with a cago of timber for Belfa3t, where Rhe ariied iu 23 days-the Union being manned exclusively (save that Mrs. Mucldejohn invariably sails with the lot) by one family, Captain Mucklejohn, and his sons Jameo, John, Alexander, William, Robert, and LemnueL The second son, Septlmus, " bad marriod a wife," and therefore "could not come," or, rather, "go." In Belfast they "copered their good and trustyahip," and otherwise ftted ser for a long voyage (matters wbich ooul no bewel done islh 'and), and then left in baU8t for Cardiffi where they took in loal for AlicantimSn, arriving there in 18 days.

AfONRY-AfARKBrandOiry I MULLIGBROR. Friday Evening. The funds opened steadily this morning at the improved quotations of yesterday, and subsequently manifested a slight incremae of firmness Consol, for money wore aist quoted 9O0 to i, and soon ad vanced to 90i to i, at which they were well sup ported to the close. The public continued to make investments, and loans on Government securities were readily obtainable at 5i per cent. Pending the arrival of further news busines is contracted within moderate limits, but the belief in the falI of Delhi seems to have become almost universaL Ths reports of its capture current previous to the 17th of June are soen to have been unquestionably false, but the impression is that the event took place three or four days later, and that, althougb the news had not yet been received by the Government authorl ties, it had reached the native bankers, and hai prompted the purchases of Government stock whioh they were making at advanced prices both a, Bombay and Caleutta just before the departore of the mails. The non-arrival of tha Autralian xteamner has led to the supposition tha' her day of sailing may again have been altered, and expectation ,is now chiefly directed to the regular India and China telegraph, which may be looked for any time between Monday and Wednesday next. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 216i; Reduced, 90* to i; New Three per Cents, 91 to i; India Stock, 213 to 215; Indi" Bonds, 23s. to 18s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4,% discount to psr. The failure of another speculator wuS announced during the morning, with differences for about 2,000l. There was no alteration in the discount-market to-day. Some few transactions took place at an eighth below the Bank rate. The foreign stock-market has been dull, and priceo generally are weaker. An advance of X per cent. occurred in Peruvian, and Turkish closed at a further small decline. Brazilian Four-and-aH,alf perCents, were negotiated at 954; Mexican, for the ccount, 22i; Peravian Four-and-a-Half per Cent,., for the account, 81i; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents, 98i; Spanish New Deferred, for the aocount, 25; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 94f, B, {, and i; Dutch Twc-and-a-.Hlf per Cents., 64 ; ani Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 984. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Amsterdam was higher; Hamburg and Paris were firm at previous rates In the corn-market this morning there was a moderate business at former prices. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows no alteration. The final quotationa of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 90c. for money and 674 15c, for the end of the month, showing a fiat market, but without any positive alteration. The letters describe general stagnation, but express confidence that a great revival will take place in October next, when busines will agan become active and the results of the narvest will have been for some time manifested A meeting of the creditors of Mesr. Carr, Brothers, and Co., of Newcastle, was held in London to-day, when it was resolved that Mr. Coleman, the accountant, should despatchod to Newcatle to frame a balance-sheet, and to report as speedily as possible on the general position of the establishment, The suspension wa announced to-day of Messr. Thomas Ashmore and Sons, general merchants. Their liabilities are not supposed to be large, as, owing to previous difficultles, the firm, although resectable, enjoyed only a limited degree of credlt. The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer has been sold at 62d., showing a further advance of 4d. The dolars have not yet been disposed of. The following communication from an experlienced merchant gives a summary of the prospects of our trade in the various articles of Indian produce:- " Sir,-In confirmation of your article of Thursday on the probable effect of the Indian disturbanoes on the export and iuport trade of Calcutta, the emporiam 0! Lower Bengal and the North-Western Provinces I beg to submit the following considerations:- " I commence with the assumption that Delhi has fallen, and that Lower Bengal remais tranquil, and that the anarcbyhs boen confined to Benares and the North-Western Provinces, where it is known that many of the European plsnters have been plundered-in some instances murdered, or, at all events, have lefttheir factories ShouldDelhi not have fallen, and should a rising have occarred in Lower Bengal-of which up to the day of our last advics I see no probability-then we could hardly look for an entire auspension of the trade. " Rice.-The preent stock of rioe In London of all kInds (as the dock returns do not distinguish between Bengal and other descriptions) is 43,000 ton The ice we receive from Bengal comes entirely from the lower provinces, and requires little care in preparatlon, and on our assumption that Lower Bengal remains quiet there is no reason to ap prehend any interruption to the supply. Raw silk, also, =s chiefly procured in Loer Bengal at four different periods of the year, and upon the same grounds our supply is not likely to be affected. " Jute and safflower oome from the eastern portion of Bengal, and are procured once annually. The disrcttthey are grown in belng qulet, we expeot no interference in ther supply. ' Oilseeds are a cold weather crop, and also chiefly procured from Lower Bengal, requiring merely cultivation and collection. There seems no reason to apprehend a falling off in the supply of these. "Cotton.-So little is shipped from Bengal_-&hlpments being from Bombay-in a review of Bengal produce lt neod not be alluded to. "Sugar, being partly from Lower Bengal ad partly from Benares and the North-Western district,, known in this market as Benares sugar, is manufactured in the cold weather-say, from November toMarch-and theproduce of the latter districts Is sent to Calcutta during the rains from mIay to September; consequently the sugar will have been made before the outbreak. But even if Delhi has faUen, on account of the complete disorganization of tho Benares and North-Western districts, under any circunmstances great delay must occur in the arrival of thesugar at Calcutta, and doubtless large uantitles have been plundered Indigo.-Bengal and the North-Western provinces produced last year 25,000 chests, being about 20 per cent. under an average crop. Of thistheNorth.tWestern and Benares districts produced about one-third, say, 8,300 chests. Indigo is manufactured only @nce a-year, requiring a considerable outlay, care, and attention in its production, which extends from the month of June to Ootober. As it appears the European planters have almost entirely abandoned the Benares and North-Western districts, we cannot hope, under the present position of affairs, that this season these will yield more thnn one-third of last year's outturn, or say 2,800 chests. The last accounts from Bengal of the prosooo of the crop are not favourable, as many districts had been suffering from drought, which would not lead us to estima, its outturn at more than last year's production, This 'would be a total outturn of 19,500 ahests, against last ear's production of 25,000 chests, of whioh uantity Great ritain will receive about 15,000 chests, the remainder being taken for other markets. On the same scale an outturn of 19,500 chests would give for Great Britain for next season a supply of 12,000 ohests. The present stock in London of Bengal indigo Is 16,000 chests, agaist an average of 20,000 cbestsand an annual average oonsumption of 20,000 chests. "Saltpetre.-It is only Bengal, Benares, aud the NorthWestera Provinces that yield us our supplies of saltpetre suitable for the manufature of gunpowder, about twothirds of which are produced in the disturbed districts and one-third in the quiet provinces. The present stock in London Is 5,200 torns, nd the quantity afloat from Calcutta 3,500 tons. The average annual consumption for these last five years is 13,000 tons. Saltpetre is rincpally *sent to Calcutta from the Benares and North-Weostern districts duriu~ the rainy season from June to October. Under the mest favourable circurnstancesJ on account of the complete anarchy in these districts, by die suspension of all negotiation oS bills and trnanmisalen of goods, at the very period when this article ought to have been sent to Ca1enutta t~he suppy rsor the season will be reduced to a mere trfle, If nb; tota stopped. 4s the continents of Europe and Amerioc entireLy depend on Bengal for their aupplies of this salt, and a the direct shipments will also be suspended frocu Beng4, should they be driven to this market for their entire suppies, it may materially interfere with the wants of the 1CmeTPonsun,erain the present position of the article. " Te haiport trade, by the lat account, is almost entirely at ai sand; and, as the Benares and North-Wester Pro. VinOe, are our princial COnsumers of cotton manufacturea, with the large rtock mn Cautta and heavy shipraents afloat, wre ist lOcK 'wIth considerable apprehension to the futtare proP Ct of this very important trade; for, although there can ta no doubt oi' our soon regaing our political asendancy it must tak time beiore our commercial relations, with the necessary aecority for trasit and negotiation of bills, pan be restored." Thb produce-markets during the week have been' inactjve, and, with the exception of those instanoax in wlrbch a speculative busines has been stimulated by the prospect of short suLpplies from India, prioes have Penerlly been wireak, The demand for sugar extremely languid, although imorte ocsaaionally subiultted to a decline of ls. to 24L o-daythere was more competition for grocery deetion The racent importation from the U>o 3teiasteemnbronghttopubliceale,andoa3~ist4 of soft din Oba kdinds which did uot aftract .. ~air offers.

The Dutch Oompanyhaw ,decle 556,000 bagseJava for their next sales", whicl commence on the 31st, The rioe-markc;t has shown a tendency to improvement with a continuance of speculative inquiry. Black pep,per has realized a further advance. The quarterly sales of cinnamon on honday comprised 900 bales less than in April. lF'irat and second sorts sold steadily at previous rates, whilethirds andfourths brought an improveihent of 2d. to 3d. The autumn sales of spice are fixed by the Dutch Trading Company for the 16th of September. The market for ealtpetre has farther advaneed Is. to 2s., and rather a large buaineaa has been transcted. Bengal last sold at 48s. 6d. to 49. for arrival, and 50s. for fine on the spot. The few transactions reported in East India show an improvement of 3d. to 6d. per pound. The tea-market has been inactive, and some ordinary congou his been disposed of at public sale at Is. lid. to is 2d., which in a lower quotation, but good common is still at Is. 21d. Other sorts remain as before. The report of the English and Australian Copper C^ompany, issued preparatory to their meeting on the 12th, states that the hnsi hand wrill admit of a dividend of 2. 6d. A new and more advantageous ontrct hsas been mnade with the Burra Burra Company for seven years. Recommendations of a committee of conference are given for the appointment of new auditors, the adoption of an improved form of accounts, the holding of the annual meetings in February in each year and the placing of the company under the Limited Liability Act. The views of the committee are also furniahed regarding pastloses and the present prospects of the concern. They state that they have had every facility from the board, and that they have been especially assisted by Mr. H. W. Schneider, M.P. At a meeting of the St. James's Hall Company the report presented atated that the building is expected to be completed before the end of the year, that a portion of the property in Regentstreet has been let on advantageous terms, and that although it has been found desiable to purchase some leases not originally contemplated the total outlay wil not much exceed the estimate made on the formation of the company. The last China mail brought to Lord Palmerston a series of resolutions passed by the British Chamber of Commerce at Shan hai, which is composed of all the principal mercantile residents, thanking the Government for the vigour of their course, and expressing regret at the opposition offered by the late House of Commons, as well as the sense entertained of its dangerous, and, as regarded Sir John Bowring, ita unjust character.

The railway-market to-day has been flat, and a decline has taken place in Birkenhead Junction, Bristol and Exeter, Lancashire and Yorkshire, South-Western, Sheffield, North-Eastern, and Midland. In consequence of heavy sales and the announcement that the dividend for the past half-year bsa been fixed at the rate of only I per cent., Great Western again receded 30s., closing at 60 to J. After official hours they were offered at 59i. An advance occurred in Caledonian and Great Northern B Stock.

In Great Indian Peniusular, Scinde, and Great Western of Canada there was a recovery from the late small decline. In French shares, Northern of France were rather bigber, while Southern showed a downward tendency. The only alteration in jointstock banks was a slight improvement in London Chartered of Australia. In miscellaneous securities, Australian Agricultural advanced in the morning, but the rise was not maintained to the close. London General Omnibus were in better demand. and a reduction of 11. occurred in Peninsular and Oriental Steam.
IB RLA ND. (BY ]iUxC AiD LwnTwBATiONAL Tnxurann. DUBLIN, FuiiAY EvxzurO. TnX sIrDBR OF MR. LITlh The anxiously expeeted trial of James Spollen, the railway servant, charged with the brutal murder of Mr. George Samuel Little, in No-vemrber last, at the Broadstone terminus, commenced this morning at 10 past 11. Chief Justicea Lefroy and Monahan took their seats upon the bench, when the Clerk of the Crown directed the prisoner to be produced. He walked up the steps leaAing to the dock with great deliberation. No visible change has taken lace in his exterior except im drefs; the white taragon jacket which he wore hitherto has been exchanged for a neat ble frock coat. His gaze seldom wandered fromthebench, but when the jury were being called he scrutinized each gentlenan closely ae his name was announced. Spollen's counsel exercised the Tight of challenge to 19 jurors. The Crown set aside five gentlemen. The jury having been impanelled, the Clerk of the Crown gave the prisoner in charge on the indictment for the murder. The ATonxzy-GzsnaL then in an able address, which occupied three hours in the delivery, stated the cae for the prosecution. In the course of his speech the learned gentleman called attention to the incidents connected with the draining of the canal and the weapons which would be produced to the jury. The larger of the hamners would be found to have red lead imbelded in the interstices of the wood at the head; this was the one recovered in the canal. The other had been used by Spollen's children in driving nails and for household purposes, and they would give evidence to the fact that it had been taken from them. It was now smeared with red lead, as if to convey the impression that it was the hammer regularly used by the prisoner; and it has not been in the children's possession since the murder. Alluding to the discovery of the money after the arrest of Spollen, the Attorney-General said that a witness would prove that the dam in the privy could eaaily be stopped, and whoever placed the money there, if he did not wish to be splashed, would stop the dam; and this witness would swear that after the murder the dam was out of order frequently on Saturday evenings, that it was stopped by human hands, and that since Spollen's arrest it had not been stopped. A great number of witnesses were examined for the Crown. but the evidence scarcely varied, at least in any nmaterial respect, from that given at the police investigation. It is almost doubtful whether the case for the prosecution will be brought to a concluaion before Monday.

GB(AT FxIiINi EDINBTuRGH,-On Wedneeday afternoon a fire, the most extensive that has occurred in Edinburgh for many years, broke out in Jamesa-court, lawnmarket, tbe result of which was the destruction of nearly two "lands" of housea. The buildings were interesting relics of the old town of Edinburgh, chiefly occupied as dwelling-houses of the poorer sort, but partiaUy used for busianes purposes. Overlooking the Mound on the north side, they formed part of that remarkable range of old buildings whose lofty gables attract the notice of strangers, giving to the old town, viewed from Prince's-street, an appearance peculiarly picturesque. At 1 o'clock nothing unusual had been observed, but in the course of a few minutes alter, the attention of persons in James'scourt was directed to the sudden illumination of one of the windows of a dwelling-house situated two storeys above the printing premises of Messrs. H. and J. Pillans. Information was despatohed to the police-office, but the messenger could hardly have reached his destination when the fire burst forth with frightful intensity. Womea ran shrieking into their houses to save their goodsandrescue their children, and people were seen rushing out in frantic disorder, some with articles of furniture, uthers with children and infirm persons in their arms or on their backs. In the lapse of a few minutes more It became evident that the fire had obtained fulU possession of the tenement, for the flames burst through the windows at the back of the house, raging there, in view of Prince's-street, with, if possible, greater vehemence than in the court. AU this took place before it ras possible to get assistance. An engine at length airived in front of James's-court, in Lawnmarket, and another took up ita position on the other side of the building on the Mound; but not a drop of water was to be had. UnhappilUy it chanced that the water at the time was turned off in this locality, and none could be hai until the wearisome process had been undertaken of correcting the arrangements regazrding its supply. For something like three-quarters of an hour the fire extended its hold upon the devoted houses, and grew in violence, while the fremen and the angry crowd looked on helplessly. With such means as were at their disposal, it must be admitted that the firemen displayed much courage in the discharge of their functions. Four en!gines from Edinburgh, and afterwards two from Leith, alo the engines from the Castle and from Leithe Fort, were in attendance, and they all, with an Improved pressure of water, ultimately got into operation. About an hour after the commencement of the fire the sight in James's-court was singularly impressive. The fismes, climbing upwards, had involved three flats in hopeless confiagration. About a quarter-past 2 o'clock the roof of the tenement in which the fire began descended with a dreadful crash, scattering stoues and red-hot fragments of timber about, to the imminent danger of the bystanders. From that moment the fire in this tenement burnt downwards with rapidit,y into the printing premises of Messrs. Pillans, where the inflammable nature of the mate. ral gave increased vigour to the flames. When the to flat of the adjoining tenement, beside the Free Church College, began to barn, the slates cracked, and gradually the roof split up as if it had been raised by a lever, and jets of flame burst through every opening, until the whole became a burning mass. After the roof of this house feU in the fire waS likewise carried downwards, but there were greater opportunities of playing the water than in the case of the first building. These efforts, assisted by an opportune shower of rain, were effectual in time in ohecking the progress of the fire in this quarter, so that the Savings-bank, which occupies the three ulndEr flats at that end of the tenement, and from which the books, cash, &-e., -were timeously removed, and the two flats above it, were saved. With regard to the building where the fire began, it was impossible to save any portion of it. A chirnney gable, which remained standiDg -until shortly after 3 o'clock, fell down at that time into the interior of the building, and the fire continued to work its way downwards, until the lowest storey of the tenement, occupied by Messrs. D. aud J. Robertson, commission agents, was burnt oat. The stoek on this flat belonged as we understand, to the Messrs. Dawson, distillers in Linlithgow, for whom bMesErs. Robertson are agents. The fire may be said to have been subdued about 5 o'clock, although the engines continrued to play upon the embers for some time longer, and up to midnight some remains of the fire stilt smouldered among the ruinous waUs. No serious accident occurred throughout the day. A person who had formerly been a fireman got his arm broken through a slight fall, and several policemen were more or less bruised; but, beyond these, nobodily injuries were sustained. In reference to the cause of the fire, it is really not known how it originated ; and, of oourse, it is not to be expected that any estimate could be formed so soon of the amount of property destroyed. The tenement of which so large a portion has just been destroyed is not only one of the most conspicuous and structurally remarkable in Edinburgh, but was also of considerable Interest from its assoeistions. The house in which Dovid Hrume resided for many years was one of the flats (third flat, counting fror James's-court) now burnt, Dr. Blair was Hume's tenant in the same house while ainme ras on the continent for a year or two ; and James Beownil sueceeded aume as tenant, afterwards removing to the flat immediately below, which has been for many years occupied by Mtessrs. Pillans as a printing-office, and is now also totally consumed; and it was here Dr. Johnson was received as a guest by his biographer.- Scotsman. ThEE NEwW WEsSTxSTZ-BRGB.-The committee upon this matter, after hearing the evidence of Mr. Stephenson, i.P., and bdr. Page, the Government engineer, agreed to report as foltows :-" Having been informed by the First Commissioner of Works that, after considering the report of the judgea appointed to report on the designs for the new public officees on the block plan, and taking intoaccount the great expense that would be incurred if the site of Westminster-brioge was changed, it is not his intention to recommend that the site of the bridge be altered. The comusistee proceeded to consider the present sdte oi the ea,sting bridge, and the alterations proposed to be made in the new bridge to meet the objections which have been taken to the rmode of construction as originally proposed. The committee learn that the precations taken for securing the old bridge have been complete; they recomn3end that the new bridge be proceeded with in conformitv wi7th the alterations in the mode of construation as se forth in Mr. Page's, letter xddressed to the Chief Commis4 sioner, July 23, 1857. The committee bave also carefaulli considered the important question of the headway of th4 bridge, and in conuezion th3rewith the subject of the gra4 dient of the roadway as now proposed, and the gradiont *bich would be consequent upon raisng the bridge. Thd committee find that, according to the plan now proposed, the roadway on the Surrey side would be 1 in 45, and if the bridge was raised from 20 to 22 feet the gradient would be I In 27; at on the biddlesex ide the gradient, as at present designed, wonld be I in 57, and, if raised, I in 45. rfhe commnittee are therefore of opinion that it vrorld not be expeieat to Diiroat the height of the bridge."

I -m arnr - n a .'-& JOHN KBNNDY. 4, Stepneygreen, Aug. 7. 'The events of the last felw days have been so remarkable that we are only now beginning to realize them. A dreadful dream seems to have been oppressing us, aLnd we are ornly now beginning to believe it to he a reality. In my letter of the 3d Inst I told you there had been a fire in cantonments on the night of the 1st. On investigation it was found that this tre had been caused by men of the 37th Native Infantry, with the view of drawing away the few English soldiers fiom the gans and then seizing them. The ruse waas unbeacessfuL The men were immediately under arms, and kept close by the guns, tbe men of the 37th beiDg ordered to put out the fire, which they did very relisotantly. On ths discovery lt was resolved to disarm the regiment, but to do it very sulddenly, sO as to preYent bloodshed nd, secure success. t'The morning of the 5th was fixed by the military authorities for the disarming. During the 4th news arrived that a Nativo Infantry reiment at *Aimghur, some 60 miles from this, had mutimed, and seized some 170,001, of treasure. The news somehow reached the Sepoys as soon as it did the authorities, and greatly excited them. The new Brigadier resolved to disarm the 37th at once. A pande was hastily ordered. The bells of arms, as they are c.led-the little houses In -which the arms are keptwere saddenly locked. No sooner did the Sepo,s see this, and also that the European soldiers were under arms, than they rushed to the hells of arms, burst open the doors, and seized their weapons. Besides this regiment there was here a Sidh regiment, which was much trusted, and likewise an Irregular Cavalry regimnent, so well thought of that at the beginning of t1hese troubles it was called in from Sultanpore, 12 miles distant, to defend us. Many spoke higbly of the loyalty of these regiments, and among others their own officers, but others doubted them, and the doubters have turned out correct. All the troops were near at the time. No sooner did the 37th seize their arms than the Sikhs fixed at their own officers, who had been spealing in such high terms of them. Before the engagement was well begun the Commander of the Irregular Cavalry fell. Captain Dodgson, the Brigode. Major, rode up to the cavalry, and called out, 'Your commnander is dead; follow me.' Immediately one of these troopers fired on him, and the ball grazed his arm. Another trooper-a loyal one-immediately turned on the rebel and cut him down, thus saving Captain Dodgson's life, as the rebel was rushinm on him with his sword, and Captain Dodgaon was for tboe moment disabled. It was evident that while the 37th was thoroughly mutinous there were loyal men among the Sikhs and the cavalry, but in the strife it was impossible to distinguish them, as they were minglea together. The rebel fire was, of course, returned by the European soldiers, and then the guns opened, mowing down numbers of the mutineers. The Europeans were a mere handful compared with the native force arrayed against them, but they had the advantage of having three gmns, while the others had only muskets. In such circumstances the mutineers could rush at onco on the guns and capture them, but this is not the native feahion. On the openin of the guns all the rebels ran for shelter behind trees ad huts, from which they tried to keep up the contest, but soon their only concern was to get entirely beyond the reach of the feared and hated white soldiers. The heavy firing continued for nearly two hours, but skirmishing continued for several hours longer. How many of the mutineers perished it is impossible to say, but it is certain that many have fallen. On our side there were four killed and 21 wounded, of whom several are sure 'o die. There were only 200 Europeans altogether, while the number against them, including the mutinous cavalry, was about 2,00. As the rebels first fired, and they were n,ear, if they had taken deliberate aim, scarcely one of the Europeans would have esca4ied. How the residents all escaped is a matter of wonder to mnany and ought certainly to be a matter of heartfelt thanksgiving. These men, maddened by defeat and thirsting for blood, as they retreated, streamed through many of the compounds in cantonments, and fired as they passed, but happily fired so much at random that no person was hut. Sieveral of the English took refuge in stables and onthouses. Others, like the commissioner and his family, who were exposed to the most imminent peril, got to the roof of their houses and hid themselves behind the parapets. My house is out of cantonmente, and therefore in the first place we were less exposed than others. We had just finished dinner, about 5 p.m., when our watchman rushed into the house and exclaimed, 'Flee, Sahib, flee, the regiments have muti.ied.' How he had known so soon I do not know, for by that time a shot had not been fired. I suppose he had heard of the soldiers gatheing, thought there was to be mischief, and ran to tell us. He had just spoken vhen -we heard the sbarp rattle of the musketry, and then the boom of the cannon. We thought it was full time -for us to move with our four children. The gari was ordered, and according to a plan formerly arranged, in the event of a disturbance, we hastened as fast as oar horse could take us, to the house of a Mr. Gordon, on the banks of the Ganges, close to its principal ferry at Benares. As that is a great thoroughfare, and it was possible enough a partyof mutineers might come that way, it was deeme prA ent to engage boats and ferry ourselves out into the middle of the river till news should reach us. Consequently the Buyerses, Ballantynes, ourselves, and some otuers got out on the river, and awaited tidings with intense anxiety. By this time the heavy firing had ceased, and the rattle of the muSsketry was so irregular that it was evident the battle was well-nigh over, but on what side the victory was we did not know. 'The whole city was covered with smnoke, which led us to fear there was an immense conflagration, but it turned out there had been only a part- of cantonments on fire At length re heard the authorities were victorious. We returned to Mr. Gordnn's house, intending to remain there for the night, when Captain Dodgson, notwithstanding his wound, accompanied by several others, galleopd into the compound, and told us that, although the mutineers were routed, they were about in great numbers, and that it was absolately necessazy for saiety to proceed to a large buildinag caDel the Mint, In the middle of cantonments, which was put into a state of defence. Most providentially, at that very time a party of English soldiers, 70 in number, were reported as having arrived at the 'ghat' (ferry), and so, escorted by them and a small portion of the Irregular Cavalry who had remained faithful, we proceeded to the Mint, where we arrived at midnight. What a scene of confusion and tumult was there l Al in front bands of English soldiers, ready to act at a moment's notice; men, women, and cbildreu, high and low, huddled together, wondering at meeting togetherat such atime and at such a place,rot knowing where they were to throw themselves down for the night, and altogether looking quite bewildered. As to sleep, that was out of the question. I felt drowsy for a few minutes between 3 and 4, when I heard one say to another, * The magistrate has just been sent for. The city is risinY.' In answer to the demand for aid, all the answer given to the head native mnagistrate in the city was, ' Do your best, we cannot spare a man.' Rioting did breakout intbe city, but it was suppressed, and the city has since remained satonishingly qruet. "The 5th (Friday) was, as you mav suppose, aday of intense excitement. No person ventured Beyond the compound of the Mint, except he wereheavily armed or strongly escorted. It was believed that the mutineers were near in xumlers, and might venture again on the combat. Our strengtu was divided between thzee places-the Treasury, a full half-mile distaut; the barracks.in another direction nearly a-quarter of a mile; and the Mint, the most central placed of the three. The treasure, however, was removed to the barracks under a strong escort without a blow being strnck, showing that our enemies are for the moment cowed. A strange thing happened in reference to this treaswre on tbe evening of the 4th. While the battle was raging the treasuro was defended by about 70 Sikhs. Their regiment was in open mutiny, and yet these remained firm. They fired on mutineers 'who appro&chedthem, and delivered up bs treasure safe, about 60,0001,, Of whioh 1,0001. was immedidtely made over to them as a present. These mer, are still with us, but after the extraordinary things which have happened, sO unexpected by all, even they are so little trusted that they are sent to doduty where t;heir unfaithful. nessi would do hittle harm, "The whole of the 5th was spent by us in the greatest confusion and discomfort imaginable. We had been complaining of the heat in our houses, and we thought with reast n ; but after our experience of the Mint heat we have bad alonging for our homes. The Mint had a zmost warlike appearance, The place was bristling with arms. All round the rooas there were rifles, swords, and other weapons. Some of the most peaceable men here, who had never been seen before, I suppose, with a weapon in their hands or at their side, went about rith pistols a their belts and swords almost trailing the ground. At night I ventured to go from the Mint to the barracks, with two friends, one of whom had a revolver and another a rifle. My principal object in going was to see a young man, a son of Dr. Tweedie, of Edinburgh, who had been wounded in the engagement of the preceding day. I found him in a wretched place, but not so ill as I had been led to expeot. He had an extraordinary escape. Three balls passed through his cap, and one through bis trousers, without touching him. One ba'l went through his shoulder, and yet there Is every prospect of a speedy cure, as no bone has been broken and no great artery cut. The doctor attending him says that if the ball had deviated in the slihtestd from the course it took, or had been proeli htestdere force, It must havo been fataL I shall never trget the scene at the hospital that night. The men lying on little bedsteads, near enough just to allow a person to pass betvfeen them with the most frightful wounds, some evidently suffering excrUCiating paUIn, and others nearly insensible, was a sickenling sight, Then, again, all over the plaint were bands of soldiers, locking at the bodies of the slain, of which many had till that time remained unremoved. The question now was howv we were to manage for the night. Some had slight native bedateads, and more bad only shakedowns. A num'iber slept in the awfully heated room, and others betook themselves to the roof of the building in the open air. The latter was our choice, None, of course, took off their day clothing, for we were to sleop in public, as we had been living in publie. R.ankwas fora time obliged to demean itself humbly. Our commissioner slept with his family in, a loom on shakedowns, with other families sleeping al around them, and there from nright to night they continue to sleep. We got on tolerably well till the middle of the night, when a dust storm came on. A number then went in, but the heat WaS8 so suffocating inside that we zemaned out tl the mornin and then with dust we looked like chimneysweeps "On the 6tb, Saturday, we were beginning to feel a little assured, and so we ventured to Dr. Butter's home, Opposite the Mint, whero we spent tho day, and, oh ! it was a lttle heaven after the crwding and th confusion of the previous day. At Dr. Butter's we remained till the evening, when we returned to the Mlint, and took our lache on the top for the night. Is was a beautiful night, wlti the moon shiniD brightly, ada little wind breat.hing, which though not over cool fanned us gomewhat. We slept, on the whole, well We had one alarm in the couse of the night. Some of the outside pickets had seen several suspicious charavter armed, so far as they could we them in the distance, and an tkis being reported our rmen got under arms. Nothing, loweve occurrc, and, happily, few knew that any alarm had been given. " On Sabbatb, the 7th, there was cvioe at the barmcks, conducted by a Churoh Missionary, the oply one who has remained here, the others havitg fled to the fort of Chupar. In the evening I preached at the Miut. Sabb"ha eveni was again sent on the top of the Mint. I ae now writing on Wcdnesday, the 10th. We have been spending the entire day at Dr. Butte's, and sleeping Mt the Mint at night, til last night when, accord. ingto Dr. Butter's advice, we alept here Yesterayuaorn. ing I weat to orhou: for a short time; this morningn y wife and children went with me, and we go to-morrow for the entire day; but as our honie is a considerable distne beyond the stations of the European pickets, some of our friends strogly advise un against the measure. In the im. mediate neighbourhood of the city all continues so very quiet that I do not myself anticipate the snallest danr The news from the out-stations ls, however, very distress iDg. Azimghur, Jaunpore, and Goruckpore are in the hands of the rebels. Several of the officiga hive been killed, and others have been too happy to be able to flee with their families. The night before last word was brought in that two officisls-one a miif. tary man and another a aivln-had been killed at Jaunpore; that the rest of the few European inhabitants :ad fled, and were in biding some 20 miles distaut. Imme. distely a party was formed for their rescue, and the whole were brought in last night in a itiable state. They had nothing but the clothes on their Eacks Their hou.es had oeen first plundered and then burnt; they themselves had a wonerfue escape; they lay down on the floor of the courtCouse, with the balls whistling over their beads, and the succeeded in getting wy at lt, imply bec use the mut neers were so busy with thae treare tHey hul se tht they had not timne to attend to them. Among the fugitives were onr vey worthy friends o r. and u rs. ge enthIr, of the Churh 3iission, wvith thehrfamilJ. Their children are now arrayed in the. garments of ours. The whole party hld been five days concealed by a native and fed by him, though, of cours3, not with dainty fare. He declae he would rither give ulp his life than betry them. " In large districts around u. government Is for a season suspended, and there is, of course,a threatening of frightful anarchy. The rising haa been entirely a militay ons; bat where It has had temporary success the gaols have been opened, the villains in them have been let loose on society, offoials have been either killed or scattered, no acknowledged authority has remained, and youn may well suppose what would he the result of such a state of things in our own land in any of its crowded districts, notwithstanding our boasted superiority to others. The people generally are certainly not against us, at least in this pat of India, and I believe the majority are at present trembling lest our days here be numbered, as they anticipate nothing hut miery if we go. "Thursday, June IL-We have to-day ventured to our bome, and here we are in peace and, I believe, in safety. We re so thankful and happy to be i our own house again; but we must not remain here. For wsoe time to come we expect to be required to sleep within the line of the English pickets. This day week we were obliged to make our hasty flight. What a memorable week it has been I We thr.ught ourselves as safe here as we could be in our native land, and as suddenly find ourselves exposed to the greatest danger. A white face was before a positive advantage; since this outbreak has commenced it as cbeen a mark for the asassin. The Sepoys were our sworn and paid defenders; whoever might fail us, it was thought they would stsd by us to the lAt, nd the result of this confidence reposed in them is that they have nearly overthrown British rule in northern India. They have been all aloug mercenies, but it ws thoght they were inseparably counmdto ushby the ties of interest. Nowr they look as if maddenedagist us. The La.dholders, merchsnts, shopkreepers, artisans-and, indeed, all the well-doing cLasses, are to a man against the movement. What the result may be Is knon only to Ged."

The details which were then laid before the publio attracted the attention of the police authorities to the state of things 'which prevailed, and the consequence has been that on each successive Sunday matters have improved, until now the place is perfectl, quiet on Sunday, to the great relief of the inhabitants. Unfortunately, however, the frightful scenes which were formerly enacted on Sunday are repeated every evening (Sunday excepted, when there is an extra body of police) and a viler set of persons than those who now congregate in the dark arches every evening could not be collected if London were scoured from one end to the other to find them. Prof5igacy of all kinds runs riot, and when this mass of filth and crime, or a portion of it, exudes from the aTches into the neighbouring streets, the vile language shouted out by numbers who are generally in a state of semidrunkenness exceeds anything that the mroat vivid pen could describe. The dark arches are a foul blot upon the metropolis; and, though Sunday profligacy has been ahated by the exertions of the police, it receives a fresh impetus On every other night of the wveek. The police themnselves are afraid to explore this dark, dangerous, and mysterious region, and scarcely ever venture beyond the various entrances.- Glooe.

RRPBESHMEBTS A- T1H ART TrE42US,g . XHIBITIOH. I TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES, Sir,-A great experiment is at the preseot time being tried in Ianchedter, and oue which a lrge clas of tbose who have at heart the improvement and moral elevation of the English workman are watching with great nteretVIz, how far the superb and unrivalled collection of works of art at pzesnt exhibiting at Old Trafford It likely to attract, Interest, and Improve the working cluseL Those, and they An many, who oonfidently predicted great results in thic direction have been oblige to confess that the Isue hs hitherto disappointed their expectatiou. The question Is often asked, " How is it that the working classes, and especially the vast population living within radiua of 20 miles round uanchester, do not hlock to this great display " With your permision I will state to the committee of the Exhibition one remon which I know deters large nu.mbers of working people from paying it a visit. It is to be found in the great expen to which the working man is put in providing the necessary refreshment for himsef and his family while within the walls of the Exhibition. It will scarcely be believed that there is an absurd aud, so far a the real interests of the underaking are concerned, mischievous regulation, which forbids all persons taking any refreshments of their own into the build iDg, thereby compeiling them to purcbae everything they require in the refreshment rooms, Now, how does this regultion operte in regara to the worldng classes?-the upper clases, I need scarcely say, are not affected by it. a the first place, who among our operatives are most likely to viit uch an exhibition as that of our Art Treasures? Certainly those who are most anxious to improve themselves, and whose tastes are the most cultivated,-in short, those whom we always look uipon as the most intelligent nd respectable of their clas. It is equally certain, also, that if the exercise of a wise economy, which iss o desirable, is found at all among the working c ass, it is found among these. When, therefore, such a man visits such a place as the Exhibition he selects a time -when lhe can enloy an entire bol7day; and, what is more, if he is manried, he likes to enjoy it in the society of his wife and family. ?ictumrcgazing Is oonfessedly a very exhausting bpsineas, and it would require more than Spartan stoicism to continue it a whole day witbout feding grievously hungry and thirsty. As matters are at prceent arranged, It is a fact that, if a working man, his ,U.fe and family, must spend a day in the Exhibition, the necessary refreshments aloae would ental the acrifice of half his week's earnings, a sacrifioe wbich few of them are content to make. Taking into consideration, therefore, the ralway fares and the admission fee, it is evident that a vit to the Art Treasures' Exhibition is, for the working man, a very expensive affair. I am myself an employer of labour, sad, from frequently meeting our workpeople both in social and educational etheinngs, I enjoy, I am proud to say, both their conndence ard friendship. From this cause 1, perhaps, learn more of their real feelingsandsentimentsthun they generally communicate to their employers, nd I have frequently heard them complain that working people, as a rule, could not afford to visit the Art isesures'Egxhibition. lam also confidently told that oren in the second class refreshment rooms refreshments oost twice as much as they are usually in the habit of paying for them, and more than four times as much as the could provide for themselves at home. And now, Sir, Iwill give you a case in point. A few days ago we sent about 100 of the scholara belong - ing to our works to the Exhibition, and of course a large number of their prents and friends accompanied them. To avoid living any encour%ement to the very objectionable reguation laid down by the committee, they prook of a substantial refreshment ontheirarrival In Manches=erbefore entering the Exhibition, and the same on coming out, Some of them, however, as keenly alive to their own Interests as the executive committee are to theirs, endeavoured to caMrr out the prindple still further by taking some provision of their own in their pockets. One of the delinquents, however, was gravely told by a waiter that if he, the waiter, were to allow the slightest refreshment to be conumed in the place, uve such as was purchased from Mr. Donsdd, he would be liable to a fine of ig. Of course such a sbtement must be too preposterous to be true. At all events I should like to see the attempt made to interfere between A hungry Englishman (especially if he hbaTened to have been born in Lancashire) and his dinner. I fear the unfostunate Walter would find his 56s but a poor compensation for the consequences. Apart, however, from the absurdity of the thing, it is really pitiable that there should be a regulation empowering a waiter to lay an embargo upon the smuggled ssndwich or biscuit, or a ruthless " A 1 " to collar a hungry small boy deep in the mysteries of a surreptitiously.enjoyed veal pie. I will now, Sir, with your permisdon point out A very simple remedy for this eiL Not long ago the executive committee erected a large tent for the increased accommodation of Mr. Donald's guests. Let them do the same for the working man, and let it be understood that it is for the converienoe of working people, where they may take their own refreshments ano enjoy them in undisturbed security. If It should be objected that this would injure Mr. Donald, I would answer that I presume Mr. Donald is not the first consideration in such an Exhibition as ours; that the teaching of great intellect-ual traths through the medium of those pricelese triumphs of genius nowv covering the walls at Old Trafford, together with all the elevating nd refining infuence which noat result from such a disply, if the masses of the people can only be brought to look at it, is a matter of far higher Importance than any arrangement with Ar. Donald. Ir, however, that gentleman is not already making a sufficiently good thing out of it, or if the alters. tion Iproposewould n anyway injure him, then byall means let the executive at onoemake a new arranement with him, and by regulations conceivedinaspirit of wise liberality, aimiDgat theconvenienceof the lower classes as well as securing the coofort of the upper, attract the worling peope to the Exhibition, and not repel them. I see they nowv propose, as an increased inducement, to admit the public for 6d. after 2 o'clock on Saturdays. This, however, will not remedy the eviL .Ashilling is small payment enough for so nch a treat, and I am sure, from what I know of the working class, they would never hegrudgeit. Moreover, 2 o'clock is too late to be available for any except those llvinq in MAnchester. Those who have to come any ditance wfl degirs to make a day of it I would, then, most respectfully suggest to the executive committee the extreme desirability of making an alteration in the matter referred to, feeling convinced that the wisdom of it 'ill be proved in the increased ttendance of thosa vhose especial benefit the mem 6 of the committee had at heart whEen they originated and so well accomplished the magnificent achievement of an exhibition of the Art Treasures of the united kingdomt I ant gliir. wan,,,-.,,k,AlrT,e A .i&±KIkSND TO THE WORKfL CLASSElS. 4-UUOU3 near ±WOcbsde, Aug. 6.

BAnaIsRhRs ox Crwum.-One large clas of rules of etiquette is conceived in the narrowest spirit of exclusion, and has for its direct object to increase the expense of the profession to practitioners. For instance, a barrister on circuit must travel by postehaize and not by coach. A barrister must take lodgings in a oihouit town, and not live at an boteL The reasons sometimes pnt forward in defence of these and similar rules will not stand the test of a momient's investigation. It has been said they are requisite to keep up the social position of the bar; but men of far bigher station habitually travel by stage coaches, and put up at hotels. They are sometimes defended on the ground that it is requisite to prevent the bar from coming in contact with attorneys and other subordinate actors in the perform. ances of an assize. This plea is either in substance the same as the former one, and rests upon some mistaken notidn of artificial "respectability;" or it gasumes that barristers would unfairly turn such clasal eucounters into opportunies for securing business. We have heard the rule explained on that ground by men of some authority, or we sbould have hesitated to mention an explanation so childisb and so insulting. But, In fact, there are lame attempts to account for the clams of rules in question in some other way than the true ane. The truth is, they are designed to snake the profession as expenaive as possible, and thereby to exclude competition. Every one who has gone a circuit knows that the leaders, following immemorial traditioi, aggravate the effect of the rules by setting the example of unnecessarily lavish remuneration of evey service that an itinerant barrister can require.

SUAfKXR ASSIZE& NORTHRN .onm_ LANCASTER, AUG. 6. The leaned judges of thi ciruit arrivsa hre ysterday afternoon from Appleby and opened the oommmision, after which their Lordships attended Divine servioe at the prish chmrch. TEX rORT OB0P Tax Cox0 r8IO25 ON TEg CRCUITS. At this town h large section of tho bar joins tke ciruit, which has not gone round to York and the northern conties, and a much larger section of the bar-fully half the members of it-joinS at Liverpool asies, going only to thxt town. The pulication of the report of the wommisioners on tbe number of the judges and the rearngement of the circuits which bas just been circuated hag inecssrily excited a great deal of commaent on the circuit amonig its mem.- bers, many of whom re likely to be very seriouaiy injured by the arrangements proposed. The report, which Ig vfery ably drawn up, exprse decidedopinion s~aInst lessning the number of the juxdges. For ti decision everybody wasgrePared. No lawyer who knows anything abouxt the buuInes of the courts, andl the work which the judges ave to get through, ever for > moment supposed ther oaies to be scicuiresI or that there were too many for the work to he perforned This was one of those pop.*i.t la reform toopico which really seem to be tges by the authors of mischief in order to divrt attention from real evils in the adinistration Of the lax sand from pracifca efforts towards their reform. With regard to the circuits, the report recommcends an aseise for Manchester, and as the circit hs Aidto oe too long, that York shall be taken from it and added to the idland Circuit; that, as a kind of oompestion, Warwick sallt be taken from the Mildland and added to the Oxford circuit; and that Hereford and Shrewabury shall be taken for the like reaon from the Oxford and added to the Wels Circuits. The report also recommends a consolidation of the 2naizes of ome Of the smaler Welsh counties to save time and expense by convertlng the two Welsh circuits into one. The report then recommends a third ciil axsire for Yorkshire, Liverpool, and Brlstol, to beheld At the sme time as the winter gaol deliveries for those places, nt also recommends that the long vacation should cease on the Ist of October, fter whichtme nd beFore Michelms Term IVieN Presss sittings may be held in London. So far as the country At lge is conerned, the only Ichanges therefore recommended by the reo rt are an addi- tional winter civil Assire at the lrge towns of York and Liverpool, and an additional asEze diviion for Manchester and BristoL From the proposed circuit changes the public can derive no advantage, and certainly no portion of the publi has desired them; for it can be of little momnent to 'tigants whether the dividion of the country in which their cause Is tried belongs to what is called theNorthern, or the Midland, or the Oxford Circuit. It is naturaly enough asked why all this change of the circuits? Why this interfering with vested interests? Who want4it Who demands it? The publio do not. The attorneys do not The bar most certainly do not ; and the judges are quite equal to the duties they have to perform, even on this long and laborious circuit. It is Answered by some that Manchester and its neigh bouring districts ought to have n asize, and tht this Additional asale to the circuit will make It too loing, as it is too long already. The comnmissioners cal. culate thst the Mnschetesr assize wil increae the length of the circuit six days, and that taking York from It wil shorten the circuit by 10 days. After this alteration, therefore, the circuit will be lust four days shorter than it is now. If itis substantially too long now, this great alteration of four circuits to accomplish this small advantage of shortening this circuit four days can only be a temporary expedient; for the same reason will remain for further change, that the circuit is too long. In fact, nothing will have been accom lished which will substautially beneft those who compli of the length of the circuit; but a great deal of anxiety and probable injury will have been inflicted on several hundreds of working barristers. It is no light matter when a man ha s pent 16 or 20 years of his life in making a practice in a district, and in winning clients by many scores of efforts, to be. quietly told to go to another district and begin agan. But, sapposing it be satidactorily proved that the Northern Circuit Is too long, and that the amount of business upon it is very great and laborious to be got through, it is equaly admitted that the amount of business on the Welch CWr¢uit is er!little, and by consolidating the aswires of the 8maller Welsrl counties, as proposed, the time occupied on that circuit will be much shorter than it now is. The Welsh Circuit adjoins Lancashire; the inanucttLring towns of Cheshire, on the Welsh Circuit, dovetail into the manufaturing towns of Iancashire; and one would have thought (if the Northern Circuit must be made less) that the ramplest way of Increasing the too little Welsh Circuit Dusiness, and diminishing the too long Northern Circuit business, would have been by adding South Ioncashire, or the new Manchester assi2es, to the Welsh Circuit, and thus avoiding another difficulty and expense which the arrangement recommended by the coumususaoners creates with regard to the Sheriff of Lancashire, who will, as now proposed, have to attend three assizes three times a-year. A separate sheriff m ht be ap poieted for Manchester or for the southern divison of the county, and this division added to the Welsh Circuit would accomplish all that is dedred wttk refereuce to both circuits. This plan would affect the interests of two circuits only-the Northern and the Welsh. Of these, the Welsh Circuit would be increased in its business, and would therefore be in some measure benefited. It could not, at all events, complain of the altertion; And inasmuch ma, with the exoeption of three or four leaders of the Northern Circuit, who have busines all round, the Northern Circuit for all practical purposes is divided into two hlves, one of which goes to LiverDolalone, and under the arpFddditional assire to chesate 'will n all probebhyBonyto iAverpool and Manchester assires, it counld make little difference to the Lancashire half of the NTorthern Circuit to what cirouit South lancashire was attached, whether to the Welsh or to the Northern. The other half of the Northern Circuit for the most part not only goes to York, but goes aso round the northern counties, cnd most of these gentlemen have business, more or less, all rond from York to IAncaster, where the Lancashire half of the members of the circuit-those who attend the lancashire sessions and those who come down only to the lancshire and Liverpool asizes-step in, and for the most part do the Lancashire business. To take away Yorkshire, as pro by the comtnissioners, and attach it to the Midlad Ct, is practicall to take from the Yorkshire bar of the Northern Circuit half their businems; and it Will of necessity also prcticaly deprive the northern ootuties of a numerous and an efficient bar; for the Liverpool leaders of ircuit, with threer er four exceptions, do not go to the northern counties, nd those who do go only go the smmer ciruit, 'when there are no Nisi prins sittings in London; and the Yorkshire leaders, who will elect to keep to Yorkshire, must of necessity join the Midland Circuit. The proposed arrangement will, therefore, in all probability, greatl injure one-half of the Northern; Circuit bar, and it wli by no means be sdvautageons to the general putbli of the northern oountIes, i who will certainly cease to have the numerous and efficient bar that they nowv have. Geographically considered, even, Liverpool, Cheshire, and Wales go conspaotlv together on the west of the islnd, as aso do Y it e and thea northern counties for the most part on the east. The change proosed imoreover, interferei with the interests of four circuits it takes the chief circuit town, Warvick, from the Midland, and, of course must seriously injure some portion of the Midland bar. t takes Hereford and Shrewsbury from the Oxford Circuit, and will interfere with the interests of many on that circuit, in addition to the injuxy inflicted on the members of the Northern Circuit in taking away York from them. All this change is proposed to be effected to avert a probable lengthening of the Northern Circuit by a period of six days. In this crleorution of the commissioners one daum appears to have been entirely overlooked. ssuming thatthhe civil business of the Northern Circuit in a ye r is Of a given quantity, and that divided, as now, Into two circuits, it occupies, say, 40 days to tryeach circuit, thecommi6sioners by thi8 report recommIend that the civil business of the circuit for one year shall henceforth be divided into three parts by the holding of a civil assize at the same timeo as the winter gaol deliveries are now held at Liverpool and York. This necessarily will lessen the time consumed by the civil business on each circuit in nearly the relative proportions of one-third as cumpared with balf, or to a period of about 30 dys. With this third civil a8size, therefore, the addition of an *8size for Manchester. which it is calculated would consume siX additional days, willsnot make the circuit so long as it now is by four days This oonsideratiorn seems to take away the very foundation on which the proposed chsiges in the circuits are based; for all that the commissioners nticipate by the proposed changes on these four circuits is to rednce the long Northern Circuit four days, or to a period of 36 davs; and the giving of a third civil assize in the winter to York and Liverpool will, it may reasonably be supposed, shorten the time of each circuit in the year by dividing the civil business into three t~arts instead of into two, and effect the object desired wilt out any ether change wfhatever in the division of *ny of the circuits. Thq proposed changes in the consolidation of the sUall Welsh assizes will save time and expense to All parties,-to the public, to jurors, to the bar, nd the judges; and the giving of assizes to Manchester and Bristol, and three civil asei2es in the year when ecessry to places where winter criminal assizes are now held archanges unquestionably called for, and will be beneficial to the public. The proposed crcuit changes will evidently in no respect benefit the public, and tho public does not call for them or want them. They will greatly -niure and unse'tle the prospects of many scres of hard- working and deserving men on those circouts, and as far as this circuit is concerned the prestige of the circuit will bs I gone. It will be no longer the great Nortbern Circuit, which by the vst variety and exent of its business has for generations trained up and fitted to adorn the bench a majority of the judges of the land. To divide the cirouit at all will be a most unpopular measue, especially when giving anadditionalwinter civil asxcewill roader such ameasureunnecessary; bat if such a measre be deter. mined upon,thenitwouldseem but reasonable thatitshould be done n a manner least calculated to injure the existing interests of this and the other circuits. By simply adding the new assize of Manchester or South Lancashire, if necessary, to the Welsh Circuits, tbeWelsh Circuits will get the business they want, and the Northern Circuit will be shortened a great deaL The Oxford Circuit willnot be deprived of two counties to give business to the Welsh circuits. It will not be necessary to compensate the Oxford Circnit for this loss by giving them Warwick, snd taling that town from the Midand; nor wil it be necesary to oompenste the Midland for their loes by giving it York. It is to be hoped that the scheme proposed by the com - rcisoners is not yet definitely determined upon bylthe Government, but that it is stil open to discusion and modification.

Gregory augon, resdig n rt. ge's-square, Cheltenbam,and he sued the residing In St 'Olg'aff°afurt haegh gD0eo defendent, G. Bicc, to recver damages for slander spolken by the defendant of the piWntiffi zmpating to him negli-gence and unskilfulness as a smrgeon. It appeared that the defendants child was taken il With the croup, and was attended by theplaintiflf The defendant, however, was not atisfied and went to the plaintiffs house, And was met at the door by the assistant. He there said the plaintiff Ws a " Booundrel,I and, being told he bad better not ay that gain, he not only repeated the objectionable word. but added that the plainff was "ea murderer, and was murdering his child." The asdstant, who was called to prove the case, stated that the defendant, wras only a journeyman tronkmaker, and that he and kis wife appeared to be ery aious about the child. The wFords wrere uttered in a loud tone, but it did not appear that they were heard by anybody besides the assistant and the maidservant who had answrered the door-belL. Mr. Powz haing stated that be should not caU Uwit. M CooI sid that slander like that spoken by the de. fendant was likely to be very injurious In a gossiping place like Cheltenham. (au lhter.) There was then some discusson as to whether the plaintif£ should have a verdict, or whether a juror should be withdrawn. Mr. Baron MAR-L ct this short by stating tht he should not certify, The defendant's counsel then withdrew the words, and the plaintiff consented to withdraw a juror, so that eah party will pay his own osts. H1T V. CHAPA.. Mr. Serjeant pigott and Mr. Powell appeared for thei plndetiffi nd tJC, Wuddleton, Q.C., and Mr. Phipeon for The plaintiff in this action, J. D. Hunt, was a gentleman living at Farm-hill-park, near Stroud, and he sued the defendant, R. Chapman, a horse dealer at Chelteohin, to recover damages Cor the breach of a contract into which ha alleged the defendant had entered with him to re-purchase a horse which he (the defendant) had sold to the plaintiff. It appeared from the evidenoe given by the plaintiff that on the 12th of December lat he purchased a hunter of the defendant upon the terms that if he (the plaintiff) returned the horse to the deendant at the end of the hunting season, the defendant would repurchase the horse, "if sound," for the sum of 1004 About a month before this tine expired the plaintiff was about to go on the continentt and, having no further use for the horse, he made up hisUnndto send the horse back. He accordingly did so,and returned the horse, but the defendant refused to acoept i leging that the agreement was that it was to be returned "fre from blemish; and, as there was a small mark on one of the knees, he was not baund to take it back. It appeared that the mark in questiof was about the size of a fourpenny-pieoe The hair had ix somoe way been taken off, but it was not explained in *hat way this happened; though it grew again immeditely, and the horse wa soon afterwards sold for 80i A good deal of evidence was given on both sides upon the nature of this mark ; but the whole of it turned out to be immaterial, as the only question which went to the jury was as to what the contraot wans The plaintiff, in aupport of his case, called upon the defendant to roduce a written paper, which the plaintiff had left with te defendant'sfther when he paid part of the parohase-money, and which, when read in evidence, supported the plaintiff's evidenoe. The defendant, Qn being examined, said he had never se the paper, andl that the agreement was that the horse was to be returned "free from blemish," andin this he was confirmed by his manservant, who was present, and heard the bargain.

Mr. Crnpps appeared for the prosecution; r. A. S. Hill, at the request of the learned judge, defended the prison ers. The prisoners, mother *nd daughter, lived together in a state of extreme wrtetchedness at Minchinhaunpton, where th ounger prisoner wsdelivered of an illegtiuijate child Qnthe 8th of April last. In addition to their extreme poverty, the prisoners conducted themselves during the tral as if they were in a half imbecilo state of mind.

The gallant General, who represents tho Eastern Division of Nzorfolk in Parliament, has been Staying in that county during the last few days. The 66th Regiment marched into Portsmouth garrison last night from Aldershott camp, which they left per special train, and await orders and a ship to embark for India. The 54th Regiment also marched into Portsmouth garrison yesterday afternoon from the camp, and will embark on Monday for India in the Sarah Sands steamship, which has been taken up to convey them out. The 34th Foot embarked yesterday morning in the Golden Fleece steamship, one of the European and American Steam xaigation Company's flotilla, and dropped oat to Spithead. The James Baines and Champion af the Seas clippers, Captains M'Donncll and M'Kirdy, dropped out to Spithead yesterday morning with the 20th, 97th, and part of the 42d regiment, as before reported. The troops on board these ships were enthusiastically cheered as they left the harbour an unusually great concourse of spoctators. They wil sail this morning for India. In consequence of the large number of reinforcements for the Indian regiments proceeding from Chatham great activity prevails at that garrieou. Sub-divisionofficers for the reoruiting servico have been selected from the regiments at Chatham and forwarded to those stations where recruiting was prooeeding previously to all the recruiting parties being called in. The foUowing regiments are ordered to be augmented,-viz., the 10th, 23d Welsh Fusileers, 24th, 29th, 32d, 35th, 43d Light Infantry, S2dLtght Infantry, 53d, 60th Rifles, 64th, 70th, 74th Highlanders, 75th, a1st, and 87th Royal Irish Fusileers. Yestorday orders were received at the Provisional Battahon, Chatham, for the reinforeements for the 82d Regiment, oonsisting of 100 non-commissioned officers and men, under the command of Lieutenant J. A. Broclc, to embark for India on board the Ghenzis Khan. The reinforcements for the 64th and 86th Regiments, under the command of Lieutenant T. R. Hamilton and Lieutenant V. G. Coates, will leave Chatham on Monday. Lieutenant-Colonel Turner's H troop of Royal Horse Artilery, under ordersf or India, arrived at head-quarters, Woolwioh, from Ireland, yesterday evening. The transport Sunderland, from lalifax, has discharged. her cargo at Woolwich Arsenal, consisting of 790 tons of returned stores, and was yesterday hauled out to the buoy to await further orders. 'The screw steam transport Balalklava, in the service of the Military Store Department of Woolwich, arrived at the Arsenal-wharf yesterday from Portsmouth, laden with returned Ordnanoe stores. Ia consequence of the heavy demands for the supply of cartridges and ammunition from Woolwich Arsenal for the service of the East India Company 150 extra hands were yesterday engaged for that department. The Defenco convict hulk, scuttled about three weeks back off Woolwich Arsenal, in order to extinguish the spontaneous ignition of a large quantity of coals in the hold of the vessel, still lies waterlogged, in spite of the exertions of upwards of 100 riggers and shipwrights in constant attendance. Yesterday a couple of steam tugs-the Monkey and the Widgeon-were attached, when they succeeded in hringing her about 30 feet inward towards the shore. As the spring tides have commenced setting in another attempt will be made to lift her nearer the whari; but although partially buoyed up between a couple of heavy barges, and crammed with empty casks, the task is still difficult. On parade, on Thursday, as the 20th Regiment was leaving the camp at Aldershott to embark for India, ColourSergeant Thomas Peden was presented by LieutenantColonel Everlegh, C.B., and the officers of the regiment with a very handsome silver teapot, bearing the badges and mottoes of the regiment, and containing a purse with 201. Colonel Everlegh, in addressing Colour-Sergeant Peden, spoke of the exemplary character he had borne during the whole time he had been in the regiment, upwards of 20 yeas, and of tbe high consideration in -which he was held by every one in the regiment; that for some years he had been in charge of the officers' mess, in which position he had been entrasted with large sums of money and the charge of very valuable plate, and that his constant care and attention had contributed muoh to the comfort of the officers. Colonel Everlegh said he trusted that the pleasure now affordod him of presenting, in the name of the officers of the 20th Regiment, this testimonial of their regard might be an indacement to the young men of the regiment to endeavour to foUow the example so plainly held before them. ColoarSergeant Peden was some time since presented by the captain of his comany with a very handsome silver watch. He is now on the strength of the depot of the regiment. A squadron of the 1st (King's) Dragoon Guards have left AIdershott for Canterbury, proceeding to India. The other squadrons will follow on the 8th, 10th, and 11th inst. The two companies of Royal Marines, 75 eaoh, under command of Captain Ward, which left Gosport at L30 p.m. on Thursday by special train, arrived at Plymouth 3.30 a.mn yesterday morning. They will probably embark to-day on boerd the steam troop ship Imperador, Commander Atkins, and sail to-morrow (Sanday) for China. The Princess Charlotte, 104 Captain George F. Vincent King, which left Plymouth, July 1, with ammunition and stores for China, experienced a fine passage to Madeira, where she arrived on the morning of the 15th of July, and siled in the evening for the Cape of Good Hope. His Netherlands Majesty's steamaer Gehdi, 6, Commnander Staring, left Plymouth Sound on Thursday afternoon for Madeira, Rio Janeiro, the Caps of Good Hope, and Batavla. At Rio she embarks 25 mutinous merchant seamen for a penal settlement at 'Ratavia.

RWPMENTATnM GOVERNMNT n VANCoU-vE!'s ISLAND.-On the eve of a new Reform Bill some despatches received by the Colonial-offlce on the subject of the esta. blishaent of a Representative Assembly in Vancouver's Islaud will be read -with intorost. MIr. jAbouchere in February, 1856, ordered that such an assembly should be convoked without loss of time, and in June followiug the Counoil of the Isand, presided over by the Governor, una. nimously agreed that the ownership of SMOZ. of freehold property or Immovable estate should constitute the qualioa. tion of a member of the Assembly, that absentee proprietors should be permitted to -vote by proxy, and that the qualification of voters should be tho ownership of 20 acres of fxeehold land, or upwards. The settlementswere to be divided into four electoral distrSct. The House of Assembly was openod on the 12th of August last, and the affair passed off very quietly. A Mr. Helmcaer was electd "Speaker," and several "election petitions" were forthwith presented, one or two of them, as in England, being evidently of a very "frivolous and vexatious" charcter, merely got up for party purposes. The House of Assembly consists of seven members onlyZ and of these three were petitioned against, leaving only the Speaker and three members at liberty to set. One oi tbe members petitioned against was unseated by a committee for want of a legal qualifleation. A report Ss given of the business (prinoloallyflnancial) hitherto trans. acted by the Assembly.
THE'INDIAN MUTINIES. I,. TO TE EDITOR OF TM TIMES. Sir,-It is just as I said in my last letter. The Government of India, In the midst of a revolt, with its native army extinguished, its second city in the hands of armed rebels, and the hearts of aU Englishmen throbbing with excitement, cannot rid itzelf of its traditions. It cannot perceive that that which has occurred is a revolution, that it has entered on a new phase of its history, that it must for the future accept its obligation to govern as well as to reign in India. It still, with the "faithful Sepoys" in revolt, clings to its theory of the " equality" between natives and Europeans, Witness thi A ct for the restriction of the press. The native, or vernacular press, was found to be bad. It was necessaxy to place it in a state of siege. It was perpetuaay attacking Government, traducing its members, inveighing against the British rule, and in the northwest preaching the doctrine that the sword is the key of Eeaven and Eell. The European press was, on the contrary, urging aU Europeans to new efforts, pointing out the certainty of relief from England, bringing to all the strength which comes of intercommunication and the sense of symphthy. 'Under such circumstances, what would a wise Government do? Suppress the native press and release the European from its few remaining restrictions ? Not a bit of it. In defiance of common sense and ordinary prudence, the doctrine of equality is maintained. Every paper is rendered liable to suspension. That is, every person connected with the Indian press is rendered liable to the confiscation of his entire property for doing his best to maintain the British empire in India. The old doctrine of equality is as strong evidently as ever. I verily believe these doctrinuares, some of them at least, would admit natives to Council at this moment if they could. You will see that "humanity" will be the next cry. There is, I believe, more genuine, heartfelt kindliness in England than in any country in the world. Yet even here the necessity of a severe retribution, of a warning sufficient to deter aU Sepoys in all generations from a similar outburst, is openly admitted. It will not be almitted in India. Our ladies have been dragged naked through the streets by the rabble of Belhi. Quietnministers of thegospel have been mnurdered. Their daughters have been cut into snippets and sold pieeemeal about the bazaar. It is a fact, atrocities such as justified Cromwell's conduct in Ireland have been perpetrated. An army paid and pampered to excess, bound by every tie of gratitude to the Government which fed it, has taken the lead in these atrocities, has committed the inexpiable military erime of shooting its own officers. And for all this, mark me, there will be no retribution. Delhi will be taken, doubtless, and some of its defenders wiU be slain, but there retribution will end. All who escape, the 20,000 who have deserted, the 40,000 who have revolted, will return to their homes and live in quiet comfort, illustrious because they have defilowered English ladies and murderedEnglish officers. The oldcdoctrine, " Conciliate, conciliate," will have its way, and be strengthened by official inertia, and that apathetic humanity which makes judges in India refuse to inflict death for crimes that might make the very stones shriek-that in quiet, orderly England would make Dragoons necessary to guard the criminals from Lynch law. I shall be told that adequate retribution is impossible, and that it is better to do nothing than to pass a sentence that cannot be fulfilled. It is, perhaps, no part of my business as an observer to suggest legislative measures; but I must be permitted to deny this assertion in the most emphatic manner. There are twenty measures within the competence of Government. I will suggest but one, by which, without drawing a sword or creating a single new tribunal, without a penny of expense or a single new bayonet, a retribution might be enacted as ample as the crime. Let the entire body of Sepoys boe placed 7 ors la loi in the full meaning of that tremendons phrase. They have rebelled against English institutions. Let them cease to protect them. Let it be distinctly understood that no law and no court protects the Sepoy's property, that no tribunal guards his honour, that no magistrate protects his life, that he is outside the law against which he has protested. In a week every Sepoy. would be a pauper, his house in fiames, himself fleeing from men who will hunt him like a wolf. There would be in such a measure at least no want of justice. He has shaken off law; let him feel the want of it. He has striven to create anarchy; let its enjoyments be brought home to him. He has endeavoured to displace the British Government; ehimpto those kindly native neighbours who, tu for the Britih Governmuent, would strip him of, every inch of land, and then slay him for the value of his teath. ANGLO.BENGALEE. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-You are perfectly right in what you say in your article of this morning relative to the retribution to be in'ficted upon those diabolical ruffians who with rathless craelty have committed atrocities upon helpless women and children the very conception of which makes the blood run cold. Every one who knows anything of the real tiger. like cowardly character of the natives of India, especially the hlahommedans, wiUl bear you oat in saying that nothing but a most terrible example made of these fiends in human form will meet the case. If we really desire to preserve order hereafter in our Indian empire, and to save the lives of our fellow-countrymen and countrywomen, we must have. no maudlin sentimentalities, no mockhumanitarianism here. Those bloodthirsty fiends have placed themselves in the same relation to their fellowman asthat of a rabid dog to his kind. Nothing but extermination wiUl cure the malady and preserve the raco. Meroy to such mad brutes would be a course the most unmerciful to mankind. They have placed themselves wholly beyond the pale of mercy. As you say, had it been the people at large there might have been room to suspect some cause for such madness and brutality; though even then it would have remained wholly without palliation. Bat the men who have enacted those scenes of horror to which yoa have referred have been the cherished children of the ruling power-the adopted sons of England. They are the men who have been partakers of all the triumphs of our position as rulers of India. They and they alone have been made part and parcel with the British conqueror, reaping wherever they reaped, and honoured whenever they werehonoured. If the people of India havo beennmal. treated, the Sepoy has been the most active in tho work. Favoured, petted, pamp ered in every way, without grievance of any kind, these men, and these only-for, as you truly assert, it is solely and entirely a military revolt-these very pampered scoundrels turn round upon us, and not only murder their officers-for that would be comparatively a small matter-but commit atrocities such as are unequalled, I beiieve, in the world's history. The fearfal tragedy now being played out in the East will ahow us more clearly the true nature of a part at least of the people over whom we rule, and I hope render us less confiding than heretofore. We shall trust less implicitly to that "moral power" by which, as we have always boasted, the few thousands con. trolled the hundred millions of our Indian subjects. We shall in future, I hope, support this moral power with the more effeotual element with a semiibarbarous and conquered pepole of a material and physical power, To anyone who reflected at all upon the subject, it was evident that the normal condition of the native army was one of mutiny. The whole of the elements of revolt were in positive exisence, though lying for a time dormant. The eoil was always ready for the seed. It only needed some sower of taxes to scatter the seeds of sediton upon the soil to produce the harvest we are now reaping. Human nature is the same all over the world, and most certainly the Hindoo and Mahommedan form no exception; and our error has been in supposing that they were this exception; and that an army composed of the conquered natives of the soil would remain faithful to their conquerors even when they became persuaded that they were powerful enough to east them out. We persnuaded ourselves to believe a lie tn the face of all wo knew of history and human nature. As usual when anything goes wrong, the first question asked en this sad occasion is, " Who Is to blame ?" And a desperate effort is made by the country to fiA it upon the Government, the East Indla Company, or some other indi. viduals, and thus exonerate itself. But I confess in the present case it appears to me that the nation at large is blameworthy in fondly embracing a deluion and cherish. ing a belief that the mercenary troops we had drawn. under our banner fzom among the conquered people of the soil possessed none of those feelings of ambition and avarice common to all others of our race, and therefore would never turn upon and rend us. And we have consequently cherished these men like very brothers, to the utter neglect, nearly so, of the rest of the people. Base though the return be, and infinitely abominable their conduct, thls baseness ahould not surprise us. But, in the name of common snse, let us take waning for the future from what has passed. Surely we can never lay another such mine to be exploded upon us whenever some scheming villain has the cunning and audacity to apply the match, Lord Ellenborough some nights past ex. premsed a hope " that we might once more regain the eonai dence of tho Sepoy, san dso repsn our pezfect confidenc, fn him." With all respect for his Lordship I would submit tiat it is utterly impossible we can ever place confidence in such ren. How ca we ? If, after 100 years of the closest intimacy that can bind man to man, that subsisting between officers and men of the same Eervice-if, after all the boons andprivileges, the medals, honours, and distinctions bestowed upon the Sepoys, the petting and pampering they have enjoyed-these men turn upon you -without any single reason, beyond that of des"re of power and love of pelf, and shoow themselves to be more demons than men, how are we to g.ve them again our confidence ? Another 100 years would not restore it, nor 200 either, after what has just hap. pened. As fox our regaining the Sepoys' confidence, it must first be shown that we have lost it. There may be a few among them made mere catspaws of by their fellows, especially among the Hindoos, but this revolt has arisen out of no lows -bf confidence in the Government, but from mere lust of power alone on the part of men whose minds had at length been opened to the Idea that they had the power to make theraselves masters of the country. It has been by fear alone that we have held India so long without any such revolt, and we can alone hold our position in that country by smnllr means The time may como when they may love us as brothers but it is not yet. I have long foreseen what has now occurred, but I freely confess that I never could have believed that when the Bengal army rose, in the confidenoe of their own strength, against their rulers it would prove more llke the explosion of a skyrocket than of a mighty avalanche. When I read thmse wondrous words, " The Bengal army has ceased to exist," I am only profoundly amazed that the British power should be so little sbaken. But, Sir, we must have no second Bengal Sepoy army. India needs it not. I assert most confidently that we now require no such army! Who re they to be opposed to, except your European soldiers, when they regain courage to try another passage of arms for supremacy? With no army to contend with nearer than the Caspian Sea, I have wondered why it should have been thought necessary to arm the Sepoy with the Enfield rifle. Who were they to fire them at except ourselves I Surely the detonating Brown Bess was good enough for Jack in carry. Ing on his duties of police, and he had no others to per. form. I repeat India requires no such force now, and if we ever raise such another ws do it only to insure a, repetition of what has just taken place. Such an army now is only a mqnstrous anomaly. Let us especially beware of training auother native artilleryman. What could these rfflians now do without the artillerymen -who have joined them? They would be next to powerless. One comfort, however, is, that the native artillerymen know next to nothing of leveling a gun or of the elevation to be given for the various distances, for they are not taught this, It being exclusively the duty of the European officers I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, .J.1. AWCI)N ALT IUeatenant-ColoneL -6-oW V. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I send you the following extract from a letter of a military officer In the Madras Presidency, peculiarly qnalified by long experience, calm habit of mind, and sound judgment to take a correct view of the state of things in India. The opLinons of sach men are especially valuable amid the various conflicting sentiments of the present day. I trust, therefore, that you will allow the extract to appearr in your columns Your obedient servant, : X. j,onaon, Ang.(t. " Madras, June 25. ;You will have swen from the papers that we are nowpas£ng throTugh what is without doubt the gravest peril to wblch (or Indian empire has ever been exposed. J do not feel at all doubtful as to the ultimate issue, because I feel persuaded that our mission in India has not yet been fulfilled, and because the present fierce outbreak, whatever may be its real cause, has been distinctly put by the mutineers themselves, Mahommedans as well as Hindoos, upon the ground of religion. It has the charater cose uentl of an open contest for Satan against Chrict, and iA. shal have " Meanwhile the danger has been very imminent, and it wll be long before it can be considered to havo fully passed away. May it lead our rulers to feel that our power hereis from God, and may it lead us all to a more humble dependence upon Him, and to more earnest endeavours for His glory I Certainly there has been enough on all sides to eat down our pride. I sunDpose everyone who has known anything of the real state of the Bengal army for years past has felt convinced that sooner or later there must be a collision between the Sepoys and their masters; but no one could bave contemplated the actual manner of it. No one could have imaginedthe posgibility of its being accompanied with such fiendish ferocity, not only towards the officers, but towards poor helpless woman and children. Had the Sepoys been ground down by oppression-had they suffered wrong from their officers to the last point of endurance, the fiercely vengeful feeling which they have evinced might have been somewhat understood; but the contrary of aU this has been the case. Discipline in the Bengal army has been proverbiaUy gentle -in our judgment dangerously so. By-and-by probably, some of the details may be published-such as Vwillmake an EnAlish.nn's blood run cold for the moment. Such things make one feel that the cause of such men must faiL In the meantime, however, the whole of India is convulsed. The wave has been felt over the whole breadth of the land. I believe, myself, that our Madras Sepoys are stanch, and that they have no sympathy with the munti. neers; stil the hahommedan spirit throughout the Presidency, and more or less in the army, has been excited. It wil subside again as soon as all hope of the restoration of a Delhi sovereignty shall have passed away-and that, I trust, w{l be the case before long. But what are we to think of the fact that a conspiracy to murder every Eoropean in the land and to overthrow our whole power has been deliberately and skilfully organized during a period of at least many months, among many thounds of men, and over an extent of some thousands of miles, from Peshawur to Peu, and during all this the whole body of Europeans should have been kept in profound ignorance of all ? I have no doubt that as we succeed in obtaining information we shall learn bow God's hand alone has turned aside the purposed eviL I feel -per suaded myself that the original design was for the four native regiments at Barrackpore to have risen together, murdering their officers, and firing and plundering Calcutta, and that this was to have been the signal for a simultaneous rising of the whole army. There was nothing, humanly judging, to prevent this. But the Government of India, unwisely as we all thought, determined to disband the 19th Native Infantry. In this it w.as necessary to move tbe regiment to Barrackpore, and while they were on their march the Oriental steamer brought up the 84th, a fine powerful regiment, who made their appearance as If from the skies. The Sepoys no longer dared to aet, and their plan was thus aciidentallydiseoncerted Then followed the lmprisonment of a number of the 3d Cavalry at Meerut, which brought the Immediate and I think premature out. break there, leading to that at Delhi. From that time the troops have risen at station after station, but all has been disjointed. Their skilfully-arranged combinations have failed, and time has been given us to hold them in check. Here at Madras there has been, asIthink, much and useless alarm-a panic, almost."
THB BNGLISH ARMY IN INDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIhEES. Sir,-The augmentation of 12 battalions to the army gives his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge a good opportunity of providing for those officers serving in India whlo were passed over during the late war, and who will probably suffer again unless some friend to the army steps rn and remind3 the authorities that there are such unfortunate men in the service, who are at this very moment ujholding the supremacy of the British power in the midst of a rebollious andungrateful native army. It is impossible that the officers alluded to2 or their friend, can be in tinie now to advocate their claims, therefore, a an Lot of justice to a neglected clas3, I publish the names of several captains who have served on "full pay" for upwards of 30 earys and also of subalterns of 15 year standing (contrast this wnth many who must of necessity he appointed to the new battalions from the half-pay list, whose service wiU amount to something like five years for captains and 10 for majors) in the hope that his Royal Highness vill include their names among the more fortunate ones. No additional expense will faU on the Government for this augmentation, and the usual objection cannot be offered in this instance. I trust that the publication in your columns of the list as below wmll secure for some of my old companions in arms a few of the loaves and fbses.

MmAxoHoLy S= icw,.-On Saturday last a sergeant of the 11th Husbrs committed suicide by cuttimg rhis throat and afterwards the arteries of his arms in his room at the barracks at Hounslow. It appears that he had lot some money, about 804, through the defaloatlon of a person whom he bad trusted in the Crimnea, and that the 18s preyed upon his rnind. He bad been upwards of 20 years in the rervice, andas much respectedt in tho rgi. mient. An inquest Iws held on the body by the coroner for the county, wvhen a verdict of "Temporary insanlity" wa reiurned. PoOR-RA S AlD P.&isPESsm.-A comnparison between the years 1857 and 1856 of the number of paupers reheved in mngland and Wales in each week exhibits a decrease in favour of this year in every instance, vaying from 2-4 to 31 per cent. The decrease is equally appiliable to In and out-door relief.
