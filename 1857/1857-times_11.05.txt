MOXEY-MARBETan-dITY I1V TRIGENOB. Wcdnssday Eveninh. There has been more general heaviness in the city to-day than at any period during the present pressure, and the fands have experienced a further reaction of three-quarters per cent. Consols for money, which closed last evening at 898 to 4, were first quoted 89i to #. Some renewal of the demand for stock on the parb of the public then caused an advance to 898, but they soon returned to 898, and a rather heavy sale final1y caused a fall to 89. For the 7th of December the last price was 89i. In the Stock-Exchange there was no particular dif ficulty iix obtainimg loans, the rate from account to account being about 6, while for short periods it was only 5 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 209 to 211; Reduced, 884 to 4; New Three per Cents., 884 to i; India Stock, 210 to 212; India Bonds, 45s. to 35s. discount; and Exchequer-biUls, 14s. to lOs. discount. The increased feeling of anxiety observable in the city to-day was owing to a general anticipation that an advance of the Bank of England rate of discount to 9 per cent. wiU immediately take place, and the applications were on a scale of saflicient magnitude to warrant the anticipation. There is no doubt, however, that they were considerably increased, not only from the extra requirements conseauent upon its being the 4th of the month, but also from the mere belief that a rise is imminent. Should the step be adopted it wir afford no reason for a diminution of confidence. On the contrary, it will show that the Bank are determiued steadily to maintain a policy which wil enable them to continue discounting freely every sound bill that may be presented. As the rate advances the amount of paper in the market is gradually reduced in proportion to the contraction of business, and the supply and demand are thus kept in a state of equilibrium. There is therefore not the slightest reason to fear that any establishment possessed of legitimate asset will be exposed to difficulties originating in the condition of the money-market. All paper accommodation wil be obtainable upon paying the true price for it, and it has already been remarked that, although the difference between the rates of 6 and 9 per cent. per annum-which amounts on three months' biUs to 1 per cent.-may be a serious drawb-.ack from all mercantile profits, it can never affect the solidity of any house not otherwise imperilled. Up to the present moment the Bank have not made any alteration in their mode of business, either with regard to the length or amount of bills, their terms for advances-to the dis4count houses, or any other point, and there is n-v ground to suppose that they will do so. An advance in the rate, with a distinction possibly in the charge for those having more than 60 days to run, is all that ls likely to be witnessed, and this is calculated to effect every object. The shipments of specie, both to America and India, are even at present far from exhibiting a certainty of profit, and, at all events, there must be a limit, andcthat not a distant one, to the conditions on which they can be continued. Hence it may be supposed that a turn must soon be witnessed, and that the next week or two will be the heaviest time of trial. For houses compromised by the American disasters, as well as those now suffering from the fall in the produce-markets, there can, of course, be no escape from terrible losses; but these are apart from any question regarding the general charge for discount. They must be borne, whether the rate of discount is 3 or 9 per cent., and thus far they have been borne so admirably as to entitle all the parties engaged to the utmost confidence and assistance that can legitimately be afforded them. The only way in which the unavoidable mischief we are called to sustain can be extended or rendered dangerous would be by the occurrence of panic, but it is to be hoped we may be spared the humiliation even of contemplating the possibility of such an event. From the drain of specie and the pressure for discount which has prevailed during the past 10 days it is to be presumed that the Bank accounts which will be made up to to-night, and published on Friday evening, will exhibit most unfavourable totals. According to the last retarn, however, there was still a margin for a reduction of more than a million in the bullion and nearly two millions in the reserve of notes before we should reach the lowest point obtained in 1847, at which period the rate of discount was not carried beyond 8 per cent. The payments faUing due to-day (the 4th of the month) were not unusually heavy. They are understood to have been extremely well met in aU quarters. The transactions in foreign stocks have been rather numerous, but prices had further given way, and the market closed at a nearly general decline. Turkish receded 4 per cent. Brazilian Four-anda-Hlalf per Cents. were negotiated at 95; Danish Three per Cents., 838 and 84A; Mexican for the account, 19, 184, and 4; Portuguese, 43i and 42X; Russian Five per Cents., 105; ditto, Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 97; Sardinian, 89; Spanish Deferred, 25 and i; for the account, 254; Turkish Six per Cents., 871 and 88; for the account, 871andr; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 974; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 95; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 631. The corn-market was steady this morning at the rates of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 95c. for money and 67'f. 15c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration. The rate of discount at Hamburg has advanced to 9 per cent. About 20,0001. in bar gold was withdrawn from the Bank to-day for exportation to the continent. The amount of gold deapatched to New York to-day was 69,3001.-namely, 56,0001. by the Ariel from Southampton, and 13,3001. by the City of Washington from Liverpool. It consisted chiefly of sovereigns. 42,0001. in half-imperials arrived at HUll to-day from Russia, and will be sold to-morrow for exportation. It transpired late this afternoon that the acceptances of the firm of Powles, Brothers, and Co., to foreign draughts had been dishononred.

BII2KENIEAD DOCKS. Yesterday a conference was held in the Mayor's Parlour, Town-hall, MYanchester, respecting the non-completion of the Birkenbead Docks. The conference was called in consequence of the supposed indisposition of the Liverpool Corporation and Dockl Conimittee to carry out the intention of the Legislature for an early completion of the Birkenhead oecks, and to postpl-no the further construetion of those wor.cs indeFnitely, to the great inconvenience and obstruction of the trade in the ports of the Miersey, and the injury of the railwav interests in connexion with the port of Birkenhead. MLr . Alderman Nieholls presided in the absence of th aMayor, .r nd there were present Sir .John Potter, M.D, Mr -,. A. r-ner, M.P., Sir Elkanah Armitage, Alderman Shnttloworth Alderman Bowker, Mr. Malcolm Ross, Mr. Fercday Smith, of the Bridgewater Trust; the Hon.

LORD BROUGHAJI ON POPULAR EDUCATION AND THE MUTINY IX ZNDIrA. On Taesday evening Lord Broughain presided at th eso-ee of the Leeds Mechanics Institution and Literary Society. lio was supported by the Right Hon. X. T. Baines, M.P., Mr. Monckton Milnes, MX., Dr. Hook, and other friends of popular education. The noble CHAIRMAN rose to address the assembly, and was received with loud and reiterated cheering. After the applause had subsided he said,-Ladies and gentlemen, I assurO you it gives me the most unfeigned satisfaction to find myself once more among my old and valaed friends and constituents. (Cheers.) It carries me back seven-anda twenty years ago, when I received at the hands of the people of Yorkshire the greatest and proudest memorial of my country's approval and of their kindness-the highest and most prized honour of my life. (Loud applause.) Bat as nothing is smore useless than vain declamation-asnothing could excuse it unless the expression of my heartfelt sense of the kindness of the people of Yorkshire, so nothing would excuse mny prolonging It for an instant to the exclusion of more useful, and therefore more important matter, for we are here met upon a practical subject, the education of the people, and especially of the working classes of tht people, not excepting those immediately above the working classes-namely, the middle classes, without whose educa tion, aye, let me add, considerably improved educationr there is no safety either for those above them or for thoso beneath them in the scale of society. (Loud applause.) I& is neither upon the improvement, of the higher classes nor the improvement of the humbler classes, but upon the improvement of the middle classes that the security of both depends. (Applause.) Now, it gives me unfeigned satisfaction to rtflect on the very material change that those last seven-and-twenty years since I last addressed you have wrought upon the condition of the people of Leeds. I then had occasion to complain, when I attended the meeting, of the very ssall beginnings of this instibution at tbat time-1 had then occasion to complain, perabps, I might have said, to chide the people of Leeds, that so little had been done, that so faint a beginning only bad been commenced; but now I find that that small beginning has ripened into the great and flourishing institution which we are now met to-night to commemorate the progress of; and though I grieve to hear from your worthy president that there are difficulties, and of a most important nature-financial difiiculties-inits affairs, I hope and trust that these, like allthe other difficulties, will before loDg be overcome, and that then we shall have that without which no mechanics' institution, no literary society, no institution or society of any sort, can hope long to flourish -a due, accurate balance of the two sides of the account, the expenditure and the revenue. (Applause.) But now of the progress that has been x'ade, and of the existing state of things as regards the instruction of the working and other classes,-it is most gratifying to find that in various parts of this great community, in almost all of the great towns, in s8ame inferior towns, even in some villages, this great work of instructios, goes on and prospers. (Hear.) Now one thing that I complained of before-and Ihave alluded to it in other parts of the countzy since I last addressed you here,-is that these institutions have been too apt to be diverted from their original intention (hear, hear), that their primitive design has been somewhat neglected or obscured by other designs that have grown up, and thus come In to take the benefit of such foundations-of suo.s voluntary associations, for none of them can be called foundations-for which originally that benefit was not designed. But nothing can be more gratifying to find, what I bave had access to see, the results of these most judicious and most wholesome, not only mest wholesome but most useful proceedings ia conjunctiou wsith the Society of Arts in London, which have been carried on for some time past, and never more successfully carried on than vesy lately in this great county. (Applause.) I will first say a word about the lectures. The original intention of all such institutions, wbether called mnechanices' institutes, or apprentice libraries, or literary societies for the working classes, or other classes-the orginal design, no doubt, was to endeavour to obtain the benefit, the great benefit of lectures, as well as the benefit of libraries. (Hoar, hear) Now, lectures are of two descriptions, either what may be called partial, andleven, to use a medical phrase, sporadic-that is to say, not continued courses of lectures, but lectures taking up one subject now and taking up another subject then. Such lectures, though infinitely inferior in their ase to con. tinued courses of lectures, continued coursns of instruction, though incomparably inferior in their benb2ts to those-ale not by any means to be despised. On the contraa , they have very great uses,-:fist of ail, in stimulating men to exex, themselves to attend courses of lectures when they can have access to them; next, to stimulate them to improve them. selves by that to which it is to be hoped, more or less, they always can have acoess by reading useful works, and to withdraw them from worso practices and worse courses into the course improing their minds without neglecting, heav-en fo.-b: ' without neglecting the eulti-ration of their bodies by at . tion to their health, and even totheir amusement, to t. rational recreation, for nothing can be aore true il old mnaximz, " All *work and no playm 's'r , aok a cull nioy (Applause.) Therefore I far fre, h to exclude these quite the contrary; but on -a conctition, that they are whbolesome recreations (hear, heatj, above all that they are inocents recreations, that they withdraw men from the .orst of all possiblc indulgencies, indulgence in excess; I only say in excess, for even I don't exclude altogether oven fermented liquors, but indulgence to excess or anything approaching to excess of that the greatest curse that can befell anY commuDity. (Applause,) Now these lectures have been delivered, by many, some by persons employed by the Yorkshire Union of 13OInstitutes, others by volunteors, y'ubllc-snirited men of learning, of abllity, of zeal in the cause of popular instruction and improvement, and to the greatest possible benefit of all clas3es to whom they have been delivered. But the great advantage to the clscs to which I am particularly referring-the working classes, I mean particilarly the class of skilled labourers, the artisan -the greatest of all these advantages isl education classes (applause); such classes as may enable those of a proper age -from between 16 and 17 to somewhere about 23 or 24-to obtain the inestimable benefits of a good literary and scientific education. (Applause.) And the advantage is inealculable which has resulted from the examinations that have bcen undertaken in various parts of the country, of which reports have been made from time to time-and latterly a very full report by the institution at the head of which is my excellen,t friend IMr. Edward llaines-to show in wh3at way these examinations have been carried on, and I rejoice to say have prospered wherever they have been carried On. Now, I will take one instance, for it not only shows the benefit of it, but it also shows how great is the evil which I a short time ago adverted to, of these institutions not being confined to those for whomn they were really designed, but being, I won't say perverted, but to a certain degree diverted for the benefit of other classes. The result of what lhas taken place in these examinations plainly shows that these difficulties no longer to any considerable degree exist. Now, I find, upon looking at the returns, that the results of the examinations over the whole district, with which the 130 Institutes are connected, are, that there have been somewhere between 35 and 40 prizes distributed, and, including the certificates, as well as the prizes that have been distributed, there have been someuhere betwcen 80 and 90 during the course of the last examsination. Hou manny besides those waho received prizes and certificates -how many candidates came forward at these different examinations? Very near double the number-I should say from 160 to 200 candidates. But we should formn a very inadequate, I might sa not onl an inadequate but a very inaccurate estimate of the rcsult of these exansinations-of their general effect in practice upon the encouragement of education and the stimulating of persons to attend these education classes-if we confined our. selves merely to the number of candidates who thus come forward, even supposing that that number was nearer 200 than 150, for probably for every one of those candidates you may reckon 30 or 40 others-otner youths-who are devoted to education, who are educating themselves at those classes, but who were not ripe to come forward to be examined aud to be candidates for the honours, but who next year, or the year after, wil' attain that maturity, and will swell thelistof candidates for the honours and certificates. ( Applause.) Now I will take oneecase as an ilUnstration, and that shal^l be, not Leeds, not Sheffield, but it shall be Hudderefield. I find that 1,100 pupils atteind those classes to be prepared to be candidates 'or the prizes and ccrtificates, though, perhaps, not above 25 or 30 actually come forward as candidates in order to obtain those prizes. But all the rest were in the course of education; all the rest are studying; all the rest passed their evenings at the schools and were preparing to be next year, or the year after, candidates for those prizes. (Applause.) Now, it is gratifying to observe hi what way theFe 1,100 or 1,200 are composed. Not above one quarter of the whole are other than young men belonging to the working classes-the artisans of Hiuddersfield. (Applause.) Twelve hundred and odd being the whole number of pupils thus engaged in education, between 900 and 1,000 are young men of the vo.king classes, the rea' being clerks or persons in a station superior to that of the working classes; bnt DO or 1,000 are en,tirely young men belonging to the skllled labourers, that is the working artisans of the great town of Huddersfield. (lHear, hear.) And so when your worthy president to-night who read his statement giving the average percentage *,f those who in this mechanics' instltution and literary society paid 15s., and of those who paid 12E. and 8s., I took leave to interrua^t him in orcer to ascertain, for it escaped me when he read it, what p3rcentage there was of the whole number of subscribers who paid 12s. and Ss., because those paying 12s. and Ss. are the mere working classes,-men living, as he said, by daily working wages and by weekly wages, and I was highly gratified to find that it was coniderably above one-third. (Hear, bear.) I iumntion therefore these things as holding out the greatest possible hopes that we are in the right patb, and that we are assisting in the educatEon, or, rather, what Is much more important, that they themselves-the working classes-are assisting in their own education, because, unless they do tbat, we nnay wish till we tire our.elves with wishing, we may toil till we fati'ue curselves to no purpose, and we shall do little or nothing -whatever expense of time, of labour, or even of money we bestow upon it-we shaU do rothing sohidandsubstantial to lelp the education of the people unless the people vill educate themselves. (Cheers.) First of all, it breaks in upon their independence. (HFear, hear.) Next, even If it had not this vice, it is not within the limits, humanly speaking, of possibility that It could succeed. Bat they must themselves succeed in providing for their own instraction, and with very little help, rather in the way of advice and suggestion than of anything-I was going to say more substantial, but than good advice and wholesome and useful suggestion there can be nothing more substantial,-anything wsiser, anything more certain than their benefiting by that, or anything more clear than their being unable vnthout that to secure their own instruction cannot be imagined. Now, there are several ways in which the mlddle classes may greatly help themselves without anything that can break in upon their ndependence-without anything that can at aU be reckoned visionary or speculative, and one or two of those things I will take leave upon the present occasion Ehortly to mention. (Hear, hear,) I have had an address presented to me this morning frdm the Early Closing Association, with which mymind, my jndgment, and my feelings, I must say, entirely go along. (Eear, hear.) Very far bs it from me to require of those who employ young pe-sons in )abour-in manufactories, for instance-or even to recomsiend to them, how respectfully soever, to give up any considerable portion of the time for which they pay their workpeople, but only let us consider what a very ensniderable proportion of the young persons of both sexes in a town like Leeds are employed, nor by manufac. turers who pay them wages for their work in order by that vwork to make a profit, bitt by shopkeepers and others, who might very well so arrauge matters as not to require 13, 14, and even 15 hours' work a-day from the young men and soung girls in their employ. (Hear, hear.) This matter beats immediately upon the question of instruction, because if a lad or a girl go to a shop at 7 o'clock in the morning, and is kept there not merely until 7 o'clock in the evening, meals included, but until 10 o'clock, making 15 hours reading, school-going, or any educatlon in any form whatever, is wholly out of the question. (Hear, hear.) The utmost you can expect is that when they come home, fatigued with their day's services in the shop, they should be too glad to get to bed, and rest thenmselves, in order that they may be able to get up at 6 o'clock the next norning, to get to the shop at 7 o'clock. Why do Isa that this might be altered without difficulty, and avoldedRy an easy arrangement on the ciart of the employers with thos young people in their employ? For this reason I address niysel not to the shopkeepers, but to the customers of the shopkeepers. (Hear, hear.) Let the customer, instead of going between 7 and 10 o'clock at night, buy whatever goods he may require before 7 o'clock (heAr, hear), and then those young persons will be released in time either to attend the school or to go home and read. (Hear, hear.) The balf-holyday Is a great success in various parts of the country, and in none more to than in London. At first it was said, "It is perfectly out of the question-the shopkeepers cannot afford it; they -will be obliged to shut up their shops." Bat had that been so ? No, the onLly difference is that the customer is obliged to go before 2 o'clock, instead of at 10 o'clock, the shopkeeper sells what he has to dispose of, the young people have their halfholyday for the recreation of their bodies and spirits, and I bope, though I am afraid not always, for the Improvement of their minds. I don't want every day to bh a holydayGod forbid-but I want every day to be so arranged by the customer and the shopkeeper as to give a little time every evening to those behind the counter from 7 o'clock in the morning. (Hear, hear.) I wonld go a step further, and say that even the manufacturer, though my observation applies less to him than to the shopkeeper, mi"ht so arrange as to give a little more time, and to press a little less hard upon bis workpeople than at present, witbout the lessening of wages, and without, I hope, leasening his profits. (Hear, hear.) I do not recommend either to the shopkeeper or the manufacturer a sudden cbange. It should be done gradually. (Hear, hear.) Suppose that the man who employs his workpeople 15 hours a-day reduced the hours to 14, my opinion is that you would not find less work done. Let it be explained to the assistants, and let them be fairly told that instead of 15 hours a-day they are only to work 14, and I have no doubt they will work all the harder and better. (Hear, hear.) There is an old maxim which may ba applied to all persons living a laborious and industrious life, and that is, that " Time is money." There is another old proverb,-" Take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves." So I say of time-take care of your minutes, and the hours will take care of thepaselves. (Hear, hear.) Don't let the minutes be wasted, any more than the hours, and depend upon it you will profit by the suggestion. (Applause.) Any listlessness or cessation of work at times which ought to be devoted to work is not oDly mischievous from its lessening the profit of labourmischievous both to the employer and to the person employed-it is not only so far hurtful, but it is also hurtful to the mind. It begets habits of listlessness-it begets habits of inattention, and therefore I say, " Attend to the minutes." It is the best advice I can give you; it is the advice which, if I may quota my own instance (applause), I have observed throughout life. Ii this economizing of time be constantly kept in review you might hereafter reduce the hours of work from 14 to 13, and afterwards to 12. I don't, however, stand upon a particular hour, or half-hour, or quarter of an hour, but I would gradually go on reducing the time until we get the hours within a reasonable compass both for the shopkeeper and those whom he employs. (Applause.) I ought to afologize for dwelling so long on this subject ("No, no," and applause), but as I began by saying that nothing is more useless than a speech of declamation it is much more useful to attend to the facts before us. Applause.) A remark has been made upon various occ ons that one very great defect in i;ohools of all descriptions, and particularly in schools icr the bumbler classes, is the want of qualification in ihe teachers. (Hear, hear.) I presented a petition to the tlouse of Lord'3 at the end of last session, signed by my noble friend `he thJa tnember for Middlesex, and by other E arm friends of popular improvoment, having reference to tlis subject, *; the statement of the memorialists was tlis, that in .very walk of life you require the test of ex,.inatici s ,.o who shall be qualified to exercise a particular c_ling. ercepting in the case of schoolmasters. To begin ,with the highest and most Important class-I mean the Te'. clergy,-they don't become capable of obtaining e .u;:h preferment without receiving holy orders, and those 1,-Ay orders are only to be obtained after due examination by the prelate of their diocess, snch examination being preceded by a course of academic study and an examination testing their fitness for the important function they wish to discharge. Then, as to medical men, you don't allow an apothecary to mix up drugs by a prescription from a physician, or a surgeon to perform an operation, or to attend to his patients surgically, without due precaution having been taken that they shall he reasonably qualified to exercise the important duties of their profession. So in the learned profession to which I have the honour of belonging, though at may be trulysaid there would be no great risk In allowing any person to go to the bar, inasmuch as if he was not fit for it he would not be very likely to thrive. (Hetr, hear, and laughter.) Atleast he would have to make uphis mind to live upon very short commons. (Renewed laughter.) Nevertheless, there are certain previous steps takenby members of both branches of the profession-both solicitors and attorneys-before they can pass their examination, sach as a clerkship for a series of years with a master. There Is this kind of training, though lately there has been complaint made that the examination in one branch of the profession is very far from sufficient, and I must say I entirely agree with the doctrine that examination ought to be compulsory, and that in the case referred to the degree of barrister-atlaw ought not to be conferred upon any who have not undergone previously an examination sufficiently searching to test their knowledge of the law. (Hear, hear.) Thin, -why should It be that the important office upon which so much depends-that of a schoolmaster-shonldx be taken up by anyone ho o utterly incap able p oever he may be from previoushabits, from knowledge, or from abrility-aye, or from character, to exerise that important office? (Ihear hear.) o rhy is it that there is no examination in that fession which of al others is the mlOSt important in the community, and upon the due performance of the higi an useful functions of which so much depends, It is not so in other countries. In France, for instance, a previout ex;amwination ls required before a person can take a school of any sort. Now, the petition I had the honour to present to the House of Lorp's ld not require that the examination, at all eventsinthefirst iustance, should be compulsory, bt it most jnstly said that if a proper and dueeprovisio were made for all who chose to present themselves voluntarily, in order to have their fitness for school keeping testea, and who wouldreceive from afproprly constited boardda certificate of their quaification, the result would he that none would keep schools bnt such certificated persons, and that, tonsequently, without makring it compuleory, the exaniuation would, in the end, become so, and the evil complainedaofewould entirely cease. (Hear, bear.) When I stated the number of yound people at Hudd(}ersflld (though the proportion there vs more than in any other town in Yorkshire) who were enjoying the benefits of a good education, and are distinguishing themselves by their prograss in attending the schools, I omitted to mention, what .1 am therefore now bound to mention, that there will now he more encouragement than ever for young persons to qualify themselves in those brancehs of knowledge, of science, and of literature which in these schools are making such material progress. I will take one instance. Those most deplorable events that have taken place in on'r eastern empire must lead, sooner or later-I hope rather sooner than later, because it rust be upon tbc extinction of that foul and execrable rebellion-to such a now modelhng and such an increase of all the civil and other offices in that vast dominion as must afford the most important, extensive, and valuable oncouragement to aU persons well educated. It is impossibleafor me at any time, and more capecially at this moment, after the recent intelligence 'a%ich has reached us from those countries, to avoid saying a word upon that rebelion before I sit down. (Hear, hear.) That most foul and execrable rebellion differs from anything that we have ever known before, and in two particulars It is most remarkable; one is the suddenness-the instantaneous, and without warning, suddenness-with which it broke out. It is a common thing to compare it, and I have heard it so compared, to the sudden explosion of some great volcano, laying under ruins by its devastation the fertile plains beneath; but it differs most materiaUy from that, because volcanic explosions are alvays preceded by some warning. The giant who is fabled to groan beneath 13tna moves and heaves the moun- tarn-gives a warning-before the torrent of liquid fire is poured forth to lay waste the plains below. To find anything like the recent, the sudden, the instantaneous outbreak of what has taken place in India we must go to the East itself for a comparison, There is nothing like it but the typhoon, which suddenly seizes upon the ocean, rippled by no wave, and intantly raises that ocean, without further warning, mountains high. So the whirl;vind of rebeLlon which broke out in the East, burst forth without the whis- per of the breath of a breeze to warn anyone of what was about to lay in devastation the whole of that superb dominion; and yet, sudden as It was, unprepared as all persons were,withont the possibility of the least preparation our countrymen, both civic and militsry, were (to their eternal, Immortal, and imperishable glory be it said) reA'y instantly to rise to do their duty and to sacrifice themselves. (Long-continued applause.) Observe In what past of our dominions it was that this atrocions rebellion broke forth-in the very portion of all Iudia which was the best cared for, and the best governed by us (hear, hear)the North-Western Provinces, where we had fixed a certAin rent, on a moderate scale, proportioned to the actual value of the produce-a rent for 30 years; where we had dug canals that traversed the country, and joined together the great rivers; where we had built, rather than constructed roads-roads, some of them as fine as any roads In Engl-'nd itself; where we had begun to construct a railway and cstablished the electric telegraph; where we had planted schools and colleges-in that district it was that this atrocious mutiny broke out, It needs no more to prove that it could not be the people themselves-I hope and trust to heaven it could not bo-but only the armed rabble whom we ourselves had taught-to a certain degree spoilt-and who had turned against ourselves those weapons which we had taught them to use, but who were met by the uncou- uerable valour of both civil and military Englishmen. Loud applause.) It was In -llahabad that one regiment which had been thanked by the officers for having joined against the mitineers in the evening of the same day rote upon its officers and massaored them at their mess, and afterwvards performed atrocities to which no references can now be made, but as bad as any committed at Cawrnpore or at Delhi. (A voice from the bottom end of the room.- "They did right twith the officers.") When I say that civil as well as military Englishmen deserve the credib of having stood against this mutinY, against this rebellion, I speak nGt vithout book, for it does so happen tbat the civil servants of the Company marched in the same line with the infantry, and were for some time the only cavalry who were available to put down the revolt. (Hear, hear.) It is to support and aid such countrymen to complete the sup. pression of such a rebellion that we have a right now to call upon aU England to imitate the example, I rejoice to say of a part of Yorkshire-I mean Sheffield, which, to its immortal honour, has sent forth, or is sending fortb, 500 men to join the armies of the East. (Hear, hear.) Don't let it be supposed that because Delhi is taken that aU is over and that all is settled. Part of the North-West ProvinceR still remains in the hands of the rebels. Oade isR not reconquered. Lucknow-I feel unspeakable anxiety even in mentioningZ the name of Lucknow. Heaven forbid that there should be ground for that an iety, but Lucknow we don't yet knov to be relieved. Then there are those hordes from Delhi, scattered over the country, casrXing on a kind of gueriUa wvar against us, wiudh we know from experience in the Peninsula was far more fatal to the French than our own unconquered legions. (Hetr.) Now, all this still to do, and allithis requiresalaTge increase of our military force; but will Englishmen ever hesitate to give their aid to increase the nuinber of those who shall go to augment the army in India, when they recollect what has been done there by their countrymen in arms, as weU as their countrymen unarmed? I speak first of their countrymen in arms, Four-and-twenty battles were fought by those gallant men before Delhifell, every one of which was equal to the battle of AIma or of Inkermani; and the siege of Delhi itself was equal to more than the siege of half a dozen Sebastopole. (Hiear, hear.) [say this, leaven knows, without the slightest wish to depreciate-God forbid-the great merits and the glories of our troops in the Crimea, bat while I flUy and freely admit their glories, it is impossible, in the circan-. stances in which the later triumph of our arms has been achieved5 to conceive what incalculable, unspeakable, and eternal claims upon the gratitude of their country our soldiers there have. (Applause.) Then never let it for a moment be supposed that we dare abandon our hold of India, though upon that neither our wealth nor power in theslightestdegree depends. (Hear, hear.) Some of our ill-wishers on the continent have ra notion that if we lose India we are done. There never was a greater delusion. (Applaue.) Long before we gained India we stood as high in the nations of the world as we have stood since, and if we lost India to-morrow we should stand as high as we do now (applause); but if we lose it we abandon millions and millions to the most cruel of all fates-the anarchy, the rapine, and tbe blood of their own contending ohiefs and tyrants; and if we lose it after being defeated our reputation is gone for ever and we are safe in no quarter of the world. Therefore it is that I do most devoutly hope, most heartily, and, I will add, most confidently, that the example set elsewhere will be followed throaghout the country, and that no lack whatever will be found of men to increase those just proportions which the army, the now absolutely necessary arn'y of the country, requires. (Applause.) I must apologize for having detained you a few minutes on this subject, but I could not find myself once more among my old constituents of Yorkshire without giving vent to those feelings which prevail upon that subject in my bosom. The noble lord then resumed his seat amid the hearty and general plaudits of the audience. The Right Hon. M. T. BAINES moved the first resolution, but in doing so he merely alluded to the past sernices of the noble chairman. The resolution was,- " To impart a eientific form to the precesEea of our great IndQrIal aits, sad to introduce the study of these into the class instruction of the artisan, would at once dignify indat.ry and rcnEer it more pro. ductive." The Rev. A. BARRY seconded the motion. Mr. R. M. MIL1ES, M.P., proposed the following sentiment:-" That the study of literature and the fine crts is eminently calculated to refine the sentiments and elevate the character of the community." The sentiment, he said, was one which would require few observations from him, because if it were not true, and if it were not accepted by all who had assembled there that night, if they did not believe that, as part of the commanity, they were honouring themselves and doing a good work for themselves and for their fellow-citizens, they would not be there at all. (Hear.) hear.) As he had been asked to sneak to the sentiment, the few observations which hewould offer would refer to the last part of it. He would leave it to others better than himself to tell tbem, if it were necessary to do so, what is the condition between the moral and the intellectual nature of man ; he would leave it to others to dlssertate upon those mysterious analogies which nade the wiser man the better man, which allied the conscience and the intellect. (Hear, hear.) They believed that to be true; that belleved that a man becauie better in becoming wiser ; they believed that the God wbo made knowledge and who made virtue bad linked them inseparabiy together. There might indeed be occa. sional aberrations and occasional exceptions, just as a man could not commit forpery unless he had learnt to write ; but it was not necessary tnat such an apologyneed be mado. But he would direct their attention to the word " coramunity," and ask them to throw their minds back into history and see how it was that knowledge and excellence had aided in the great work of advancing mankind simply because it had been the knowledge and the intellectual exercise of individual men, of special classes, and not of the community. They need only throw their minds back to the leading event in the history of mankind, and see how very small portions of the globe had exercised the most enormous and the most snimitable inflaence over the destinies of the human race simply because the intellectual powers which they exercised were exercised by a community of men. There had no doubt been in the great Eastern world many men of very great ability, many men inspired perbaps with the brightest fire of genius, but who had had very little influence on mankind; yet look upon that little Greece-that spot upon the map of the world-and see how that knowledge and intellect had uprooted the whole of that community, how it had exI ercised such an enormous influence over the deotiuies of mankind. So, dowr. to the middle ages of the world. Sea what little Veuice did; see what little Holland did; see how those small communities had made the very history of their times. But the assembly would perhaps say, " They, too, have failed-they, too, passed away before other more powerful influences;" but he thought if they looked a little closer they would find that they mainly failed because in all th'ose countries there was a mass of the commiunity who were not penetrated by knowledge, there were servile classes wbo were not affected, they were the labouring classes, only hewers of wood and drawers of water, and thus the whole community did not represent the knowledge and the power of the nation. (Applause.) It was well known thac in those communities there did no' exist that great gift of general civil liberty whlch the people of this country were so thankful to Providence that they enjoyed. (Hiear, hear.) It was in the free atmosphere of public lie aud political discussion that knowledge alone could pcnetr.ae down to the depths of the people; it was only when every mian had an individual and a Civil exitstace that he iould be called upon to exercioe those responsibilitles which were intimately connected with the developiment of his moral and of his intellectual character. (Applause.) These were tire privileges which inglishmen enjoyed, and which he thought authorized him to say that they vnighE l:oe not to be i;cluded in the genbral law cf tei;cdcc:iue and fal of nato-s, because they had not confined their knowledge and education to individuals and to classes, but, as they best could, they were distributing them among the whole mass oi the people. (Applaase.) Lard rou hanm had re, iewed in some degree the circumstances of his past life, and he felt the great advanice which had been made on this suhject in theae days. His lordship would well remember the time when, in the minds even of many good m,en, knowledge was onneoted with necessary evil. He could rememl;;r the time when the Sanday-school teacher waLs looked liron -with contempt, as a favourerof the dangerous principles of the French revolution. But those days had passed away, and, though knowledge had not yet been carried far enouigh, he believed that the country did feel its duty seriously and earnestly. (Hear, hear.) The words " finc arts" occurred in the sentiment which he had to propose. Most o' them bad no doubt been to the Manchester Exhibition, and he thought Pa who had gone there would have felt what a noble effort that was which bad extended that whlch in other countries was a mere luxury to certsin c.esses as far as possible within the reach even of the poorest of our fellow-citizens. Tfhen he (Mr. MilneR) was there the other day there were two or three reflections strack him as showing how tha power of individual man was multiplied in an infinite degree by the effect of it being associated with the sentiments of the community. Almost within the memory of living man there was a poor lawyer's clerk at Bristol. of the name of Chatterton-a wonderful boy of whom Wordsworth had spoken as "The wondrous boy, who perished in his prlde"-a bov who beiore the a'>e of 12 produced some of the most wonderful works in nglish literature, and who perished in a London garret, seemingly neglected and forgotten by every human being; and e1. it wrs around the picture of " Tl:e Death of Chatterton" that tha multitudes collectedatthe Manchester Exhibition in such force that it was alnost impossible to get a look at the picture. Mr. Mlines also referred to the history of John Keat>s, a line oE whose great poemn stood up in frGnt of the MWanchester Exhibition in letters la.ger than the human arm, citing it, as well as the case of Chatterton, for the purpose ot showing that even genius Which thonght itself forgotten becomres immortal by the reciprocal power of the sympathy of multitudes of men. But, be continued they must not merely congratulate themselves that much bad been done in tho way of education-they must try to do more. They must understand that there was not a single child who grew up i=orsnt how to real and writs who was not both a shame and a danger to the community. Let tLein look for a moment at what had beendcne in India by organized ignorai e ; loolc at the Sepoy army, and see what was the effect of tho well-disoiplined hand -aid thc ill-diselplined mind; see what it was when the arms and the hands were guided only by passion and by prejudice, ana when there was neither truc religion nor true l^yalty, nor true honesty and heart. Sea the dangers of organized ignorance; sre what it washow cruel to the defenseless, how craven before the brave: (Applause). lHe asked them to applythis totheir own lives and io their fellow-citizens ; to tr-ke carethat no one of theu, so far as they could have influerce, slould be brought tp, either in this or in any other country, without tle means of knowledge beimg supplied to them. (Hear, hear.) He knew very well that mere readin g and writing was not all but he 'new veryv well that it was a very great deal, aud that a boy who grew up without reading and wrtiug was in a certain degree an enemy of his species, because he found that he was in an inferior and servile condition, and his heart was naturally filled with envy and every bad feeling to those who were superior tzo himself. (Hear, hear.) Therefore this prinmary education was of all things tho one thing which should he made an absolute necessity in this nation, Primary education wa-; not all. He knew there were nations at the present tinme who had a very perfect primary education, and who were still in a very lowv and despised state. He knew there were portions of Europe in which every child 12 years of age knew how- to read and write, but a very large por- tion of the simen of '1 knew neither one nor the other. Why was that? Because they were not able to combine wi ls primary education those mleans of after--nowlerge which she political, the moral, and the scial life of this counstry EO amply snDpled. Let the ermployers of labour, therefore, do all they cenld to remedy this great evil, for there ws still a large uneducated class as the bboin ox Wso co0nmunity,-tbat which supplied the dangerous clamses, filled the gaols, :rud in some deg^ree endangered the property and ever. the lives of others. He called, then, up,on every employer of labour to do the most in his power snaa no man nor child within his reach, and if possible no nman, should cone within that category; and, above all, ho would call upmn those who laboured themselves-those whom they must try to inspire with the desire of knowledge-to remember what a country it was in which they lived; that it was a country in which knowledge. combined with virtue, would enable any man to be anything. (Applause.) Without knowleoge among the community, even the greatest sciences and the most magnificent discoveries of mankind fell to nothing. After giving one or two illustrations of this tho hon. inember concluded by saying that from the twelfth contury down to the present time all that amount of human invontion had been lost, because there was not sufficient intelligenco among the general community to inake use of those discoveries. So now, from the bighest to the lowest, the most imprtant thing that they could all do was to strive al they corlld to improve tbelr own minds and the minds of all about them. (Applause.) If they did that every one of theDm -would become a wiper and happier man, and as a nation they might look forward to be exempted from what appeared frosmi history to have been hitherto almost the general destiny of mankind, and they would be marched forward to untold centuries, fearing God, and having no other fear. (Applaise.) Dr. HooK seconded the resolution, and addressed the meeting at considezable length. After expressing his appreciation of the services rendered to popular education by the noble chairman, ho dwelt on the importance of the mechanics' institutions in promoting the educational welfare of the peple. The Very Rev. the Dean of RfroN moved the next sentiment, aud in doing so pointed out the necessity of their not only comprehending the daty of these institutions, but of carrying out that duty, and then briefly alluded to tendency in all institutions to degenerate from their original design, urging upon the friends of mechanics' institutions to take care that, so far as regarded mechanics' institutions of the present day, this tendency should be checked. The sentiment was as followa: "That iu the opinion of this meeting It is desirable that mechanics and literary nstituttions abould offer faciules for the asteiatic In'truction of the young and adult porion of the ommunnity, espeialy n he principles of tnose arta and tradee by which they have to earn their subeistence." Mr. H. PEASE. ALP., briefly seconded the sentiment, and dwelt upon the importance of education as provided by these institutions in promoting the general welfare of the country. (Hear, hear.) The Rev. Dr. BOOTH moved the next sentiment.- " That the esstemus of examinatlon of the Scliety of Arsi and of the Hehdouna'l Council of the University of Oxfc,d are both well calculated to stinulate the educatlonal activity of the youth ot the middle and working clss3es of soclety, and to assist the usefulness cf popular institutions.' Addressing himself more particularly to the young men now studying in the classes of the Leeds Mechanics' Institution, he said that, as the President of the Council of the Society of Arts, he was most happy to state that after two years of trial the council had found the system introduced by the Society of Arts had been eminsently successful, and in proof of that he referred to the appointment of a young manx from Leeds to the eow Observatory, and who was spoken of in the highest terms for his knowledge and intelligence, and to the fact, that last year two nominations in the civil service placed at the disposal of the society by Earl Granville, and this year four nominations, had been won by candidates sent up by them. This showed that their snccess was of a practical character, and he was glad to state that the society had received applications for examination from i6anchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, and other places throughout the country, showing the interest now colt in those examinz. tions. I addition,he mightsatate that the two Universities had as regarded the middle class schools adoptAd the principle of examination introduced by the Society of Arts, ging further evidence of the general conviction of the importance of these examinations; and here he might remind his young friends that God had ordained that any mental acquisiion whatever was only the result of labour. (Hear, hear.) Dr, Booth concluded by observing that, as the Universities had adopted the system of examinations as to middle class echools, the Society of Arts would, in future, confine iteelf to those educated in the classes of the mechanics' institutions. (Hear, hear.) Mr. W. B. ForsTsE seconded the sentiment, dwelling in terms of congratulation on the system of examiuation adopted by the Society of Arts and the Universities, a'ter which he alluded to the labours of their noble chairman, and to the importance of social reform, urging them in the present to seek to imiitate the labours of their noble chairman in the past with reference to the great social questions of his day. Lord Brougham having vacated the chair, which was taken )ro tens, by Mr. James Kitson, The Mayor of LEEDS, in very complimentary terms, Moved- That the uost cordlal thauLs of this meeting be offerad to Lord Brougham for the bigh honou r and the valuable service he has ren dered the Insitution Ly presiding on this occasioan" (Apolause.) Mr. J. G. MARSiALL seconded the motion, and expressed his high sense of the kindness of the noble lord in presiding on that occasion, and, as a large employer of labour, and as one who had taken part in most of the social questions of his day, he was happy to bear his testimony to the progress which had been made in the intelligence of the workpeople, in their love of order, in their right understanding and appreciation of the objects for which the society was instituted, and in the softening down of prejudice which had before separated them, all of which had tendeA to bind then more closely together. (Hear, hear.) That he thought was the best thanks the noble lord could have. The resolution was carried with enthusiastic acclama. tion, Lord BROUGHAM briefly replied by saying-i return you all my most hearty thanks. (Applauso.) Mlr. E. BAISES then moved, and the Rev. R. BROWNV seconded,- * That the tbanks of this meOtiog he given to those friends of education who I9sve honoured us by their presence ari aid this evenineg." The resolution was carried, and the proceedings terminated at a quarter-past 10 o'clock.
AtSTRALIAN LI'FE.-Take any day of Australian life. You coine home after a bard, dusty dav's work, anl you long for a quiet evening with your wife and children sr.ch as you could get once in dear old England. When ycG sit down, to dinne-, which your wife his had to cook, and your children to prepare for, you see the partner of your domestic joys with a face (from flea and mosquito bites) like a pottle of prize strawberries at, Chisvck, a ple sant object to contemplate of an evening. During your dinner you aro tormented with flies and bitten by fleas your very slice of roast mutton on your plAte, before yoe have time to d-spose of It, is blown by the yeUow bottle full of live maggots-you push your plate away sick and di'sgnsted-you pour out and drink half your pale ale, and in a moment yoir glass Is crammed w it'h ten thousand dehauched flle7, who die In drunken happinezs. You call In your children; they come, looking squalid, pale, and jaded. no rosy cheeks here-you help your wife to put away the things, and then sit down with tiies, fles, and mosqrutoes, a mottled-face wife, irritable children, and your o-n pleasant .efcections. You may have made a very fortunate speculation that day; but it takes a vast; amount of nmoney to compensate you for so muach dormestic miserv.

LONDON{, THURSDAY, ZYOVEAfBE 5, 1857. The presentation of a sword by a civic Corporation to a Royal Duke may seem at first sight one of those ordinary events which in former times Court gossips recorded and laiureates celebrated. But at the present day there is a new life puit into I such ceremonies by the fact that the receivers are for the most part worthy and the donors sincere. Every one in this active and enlightened society of ours does or is expected to do his duty, and even a scion of Royalty would scarcely obtain the honours of a municipality and the plaudits of an audience unless he were recommended by qualities independent of his rank. The reception of the Duke of CAMBRIDGE yesterday was an event not unworthy of a great eity, a free country, and a popular dynasty. The Duke represented that quiet, sensible, unassuming Royalty of which the House of H,.NovR has, on the whole, been the type since it came into tihese kingdoms. The City of London was not an inapt representative of the loyalty-sometimes a little noisy and out of taste, but always sober, reflecting, and sensiblewhich marks the British people. The presentation of a sword naturaLy led to observations cn the Duke's past services and his present high official position. On both these subjects the Chamberlain, Sir Joux KEY, spoke at length and with fluency. He recalled the actions In which the Duke had been engaged, the perils which he had escaped, the labours he had undergone, and showed that his Royal Highness had well earned a soldier's weapon. Nor was the City, as the champion of liberty and reform, an unfit body thus to express the sentiments of the nation; for the Duke is now in a position to do much for the improvement of our military institutions, and has already entered into the path of reform. The disasters of the Crimea would not be lost on one who had witnessed them, who knew that, though the prestige of England might have been temporarily lowered, the good fame of its soldiers had suffered no dishonour. " Our sucLCt cesses," said the Chamberlain. < were owing to the valiant spirit of the many, otur losses to ' the mismanagement of the few." To direct this undeniable courage with greater skill, to educate the few who must command until there be no longer any fear of mismanagement, is the task which a Commander-in-Chief might propose to himself, and in which the first City in the empire might encourage him. The Duke of CAMBRIDGE has certainly reason to ie proud of the confidence which the community is disposed to place in him. The Corporation of London is in this matter nothing more than the representative oI the country. In alluding to the services of the Duke in the Crimea snd elsewhere the Clamberlain was not indulg- in eimpty flatttry. The present Commandv- in-Chief must be allowed on all hands to have devoted his life to the military profession. From early manhood he has always been among soldiers in England or Ireland or the Mediterranean, interesting himself in the practical working of the military machine in a very different manner from that of the great body of Royal or noble warriors. In the Crimea the Duke's eareer. although short, wan well fitted to add to his reputation as a gallant and hard-working officer. He shared the dangers and the hardships of the rest, and on his return home, however much his sympathies may have been with those who admicnistered the army, he acknowledged openly the shortcomings of 1854 and the necessity of a great change of system. It is for these reasons that we, together with the great body of the community, saw with pleasure his Royal Highness's advancement to the high place of Commander-in-Chief. We knew that the Duke was popular with the army, and from his station would be able to deal with the more perverse of the old school better than a General appointed merely for seniority or services. We knew that he was young and not sufficiently a lauder of past times to stand in the way of improvement and reform. Moreover, the Duke's position as a member of the Royal Family would give him an independence of action which it is said former Commanders-in-Chief scarcely possessed. The result has equalled all expectations, as was remarked yesterday. "We "see in our military councils a vigour of purpose, "a discrimination of character, a breadth of plan, "and object in the educational arrangements," which are beginning to have their effect. Indeed, it can hardly be denied that the discussions of the last three years are producing their fruit. A new and better spirit has shown itself in the army, which -we may trust wiUl not be extinguished. India is aiding in the reform. The spectacle of how real professional soldiers can march and fight, how IIAVELOO and OUTRA3M can follow up a victory, how WrLsoN and NIcHoLsox can assault works, must make its impression on the whole body of amateurs and their partisans. To make the officers throughout the QurmN's army as able and active as those whose exploits are now reaching us, to rmake blundering, and quarrelling, and recrimination and insinuation things to be heard of no more; in short, to make the army what it ought to be, considering the material and the cost, is now the task of the Commander-in-Chief. The confidence that it wil not be neglected by the Duke of CA31sRInc has inspired aU the friendly [utterances of corporations, the public, and the press. The speeches of the Duke of CAs.srrBnDG and of Lord GRANVILLE at the dinner which succeeded the ceremony are occupied more with present events than with the memories of the past. The war with Russia gives place to the struggle in India; the calamities of Scutari to the horrors of Cawnpore. The Commander-in-Chief claims for the army the credit of deserving well of its country, and no one will dispute the claim. To keep it at its full efficiency, not for the purpose of aggression, but to defend these islands and their dependencies, is his earnest advice, and in this he will meet with dissent from no moderate politician. Lord GRANVILL'S speech is chiefly devoted to a defence of Lord CANNING. This is, indeed, an important subject, aud hardly to be treated of in an afterdinner speech. Lord GRANvILE considers that the Governor-General has been hastily and harshly judged. We trust, indeed, that this may turn out to be the case. We have not been among thosewho have attacked Lord CANNLNG. From the outbreak of this revolt the Government at Calcutta has been violently assailed from many quarters, but not in these columns. Until the appearance of the Governor-General's proclamation we said not a word which could be construed into a reflection on him, or could indicate a doubt of the firmness of his administration. We are glad to hear that the report of differences between Lord CAxNiNG and Sir COLIN CAMIPBELL is incorrect. We also willingly give ear to any explanations which tend to show that the proclamation of the Government was less un-wise than is supposed, or that Mr. GRANT has not superseded the authority of General NEILL. But it is evident that Lord GRANVZILE has hardly more information on the subject than ourselves, and as plain that his own feelings lead him to censure the acts which have moved the indignation of the public. It might be said that we in England do not umderstand an Indian question, but here we have the concurrence of the whole Indian community. If the interference of Mr. GRANT was the legitimate comment on the proclarmation of Lord CANNING, then we must still hold that both chief and subordinates have deeply erred.
In the first year of the present century the population of Great Britain amounted to 10,942,646 souls. Fifty years later, that is to say, at the time of the last census, it amounted to 21,121,967 souls, so that the resources of the Empire in this respect have been as nearly as possible doubled. In the year 1811 the numbers were found to be 12,596,803. That year and thetwo years foUowing were years of sanguinary war, and yet, when the military establishments of the country for 1814 came to be settled, no difficulty whatever was anticipated or experienced in providing 237,000 men for the regular army, and 83,000 for the regular militia. It is needless to add a syllable to these simple figures in proof of the ability of England to maintain a competent army. The material exists in abundance-the work is one of purveyance and manufacture alone. The actual progress of recruiting at this moment is in one respect satisfactory enough. Men pour in rapidly; in some weeks from 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers have been added to the army, and the average rate would undoubtedly yield a body of 60,000 as the aggregate result of the year. It is affirmed, however, as the reader wil observe in our correspondence, that the quality of the new levies is not always so good as it should bethat the recruits are young and undersized, that they do not resemble the recruits of former days, and that the pith and marrow of Britain are not to be found, as of old, among the aspirants to the profession of arms. To what extent these exceptions are sustainable we do not attempt to determine, but the subject deserves attentive consideration. It can hardly be presumed that the standard of national strength or stature can have been actually reduced during the 40 years of peace and prosperity which we have enjoyed Bince the close of the last great war. A prejudicial influence has certainly been ascribed to our manufacturing avocations, which arrest, it is said, the development of the frame by prematiure occupation, protracted toil, and close confinement; and it has been imagined that the general habits of the age, in substituting more civilized and sedentary pursuits for the ruder customs of our forefathers, may have tended to restrict that animal expansion usually incidental to barbaric life. There may be something in these surmises, but it is hard to believe that the balance of advantages can be against the present day. If we have less wrestling and cockfighting we have better food, better dwellings, and better arrangements of all kinds. Bread, clothing, and fuel are cheap, work plentiful, marriages numerous, and the discontent of old days unknown. If we have town libraries to keep men indoors ve have also baths and washhouses to keep them healthy. Confinement in cotton-mills may act depressingly upon the body, cspecially in the case of ohildrwn, but those best acquainted with English country life well know how seldom there is much to be envied in the lot of the agricultural labourer. The RxG1s - GzNiRA reprinands us and warns us, as in duty bound, but as a matter of fact we are a far cleaner nation than we were 50 years ago, though we are still far from being what we should be. There is nothing in a town life or manufacturing employment which need entail any disqualification for military duties. In the last war the best recruits for the Light Dragoon Regiments were taken from the pure Cockney population of the metropolis, and two of the most renowned regiments of the Line were raised from the weavers of Nottingham and Glasgow. We must needs assame, then, that if our recruits are not so tall as they used to be, the fault lies in the comparative attractions of the service, and not In the degeneracy of the population ; in fact, this seems to be the view taken by our correspondents, who remark, not that well-grown lads are not to be met with, but that these specimens escape the recruiting sergeant, and leave that officer to make up his list from less promising materials. As far as this is the case it would, of course, go to prove that service in the army had become less popular than formerly, aud, as we know that the conditions of such service have been modified most materially to the advantage of the soldier, it follows as an almost necessary conclusion that the recruiting sergeant is outbidden by other competitors. In this there cannot be anything to lament, for it points merely to the general prosperity of the nation, to the wholesome demaand for labour, and to the satisfactory wages which that labour commands. The material out of which good soldiers are made has become more in request, mnd consequently dearer; that would be the natural deduction from the foregoing premisses if they could be fairly established. We could get what we wanted, but we should have to pay a little more for it. We entertain some doubts, however, whether the case admits of this precise representation. The condition of the soldier has been so greatly improved of late that we doubt whether the best specimens of British youth could really be carried off by better offers if the facts were all known and a fair comparison instituted. We suspect that military service hardly gets its due. The truth is that, owing to the operation of our military system, we always go into the market at a disadvantage. We cut down our establishments so ruthlessly that when we want soldiers we are sure to want them in a hurry, and when things are wanted in a hurry they must generally be taken on unfa. vourable terms. As a natural consequence, the notifications of a recruiting sergeant have a certain air of enticement about them, and enticement implies something like a trap. Now, whatever may have been the case in times past, there is certainly no real occasion for such an attitude at present. Compared with the ordinary lot of unskilled labour, service in the British army is very good service indeed, and, though a brisk trade and a prodigious commerce will necessarily absorb a vast number of hands, we cannot but think that enough must be left, and of a good description, to feed the ranks of the Line. In point of fact, even the present demand is but a trifle compared with the actual resources of the population. What we appear to want is a good understanding between the recruit and his paymasters, a good machinery for keeping things going, and a little more caution in cutting down our establishments, so as to avoid a sudden run upon the market. In some quarters ideas have been expressed in disparagement of stature qualifications generally. Many people now argue that personal strength, originally depreciated by the invention of gunpowder, has been still more completely superseded by the recent improvements in firearrs; that the Enfield rifle will level all such distinctions, and that for the matter of marching, and so forth. a little man will do at least as much work as a big one. We cannot altogether controvert these views, and, so far as mere height goes, perhaps a stout well-formed lad would be none the less up to the work of a soldier for lacking an inch or two of the old standard. It should be recollected, too, that if recruits are taken young a course of good rations, good lodging, and wholesome training has a marvellous effect in developing the proportions of the body. Two years in barracks wil change many a puny lad into a good-looking soldier, and, indeed, although our standard for recruits has been constantly lowered under the exigencies of sudden pressure, the appearance of a regiment under arms is almost always satisfactory. After all, however, unless it can be shown-which we do not belleve -that the stature of Englishmen generally has decreased, there can be no reason why the State should not get the service of the best specimens as weU as other employers. Sometimes personal appearance carries substantial power with it. Savages caricature the idea by painting their bodies or their arms so as to secure artificially some new and terrifying features, and M. THIERS has observed that the first invasion of Portugal by the French might have been attended with other results if NAPOLEON, instead of sending young conscripts on the expedition, had impressed the population with the sight of some of the old brigades of the armies of Italy or the Rhine. There is the more reason for attending to this subject inasmuch as our errors seem to be principally errors of method alone. In reality, the State has of late years dealt liberally enough with the soldier, and offered terms calculated to secure the best class of applicants ; but the arrangements are such that the recruit does not see satisfactorily through his bargain. As a matter of fact, he is honestly treated, and gets either his money or a good equivalent for it ; but equivalents are perplexing things in rustic eyes, and the attractions of the service perhaps suffer in consequence, though there is now really no hardship occasioned.
The commercial panic across the Atlantic is beginning to lead to a very rigid economic inquiry. The money is gone, and who has spent it all ? That is the question. We need not add that the question is asked with considerable irritation and sharpness of tone, sufficient to account for any amount of reluctance in the culprit to come forward and confess. Who has spent all the money ? The Hue and Cry of New York offers an almost un]imited reward for his or her apprehension. Whoever discovers the criminal will receive not only a pension of several thousand dollars for life, but also a civic crown; he will be clothed in splendid apparel, and led on horseback through the streets of the city. All New York is at present busy in searching for the gigantic spendthrift. Where has he gone? What has become of him ? Who saw him last ? What train did he leave by? Has he fled to the Dismal Swamp, or to California, or to Nicaragua ? Is he still in the city, evading pursuit ? Everybody is looking into cupboards, behind doors, under beds, and in all holes and corners of upper and lower stories to see if he is there. When a man becomes a bankrupt, and cannot find out who is to blame for it; when he has decided that, of course, he himself has had nothing to do with it ; that none of his clerks are in fault, or the Post-office, or the Government, or the Custom-house, - in lack of every other cause of the smash, he turns round upon his wife - "Yes ; now I have got it. I always thought it "vould come to this. Now I see the consequence "of haying married ,a expensiye woman," This our contempozary, the New York Times, tells us, is now the general explanation given at New York of the recent convulsion of the moneymarket. Women are the burden of conversation, and the whole community is agreed that it has married a most expensive wife. AU the New York merchants are turning round fiercely upon their domestic partners; the extravagant wives have done it all-it is the French silks, the crinoline and moire, the gloves and feathers, fans and furbelows, that have ruined them; these have taken the money out of the country. The whole city, says our contemporary, is full of " misOgynist declamation." " From the extreme "of obsequiou gallantry we are passed to the " opposite excess of vituperative injustice. We "are treating them, in fact, very much as the "African savage treats his fetish. In the times of "our prosperity we could not sufficiently adulate "these lovely omnipotent beings. But the pretty "creatures of yesterday are the extravagant sirens " of to-day." Severe sumptuarylaws arealmostmeditated-enactments against dress, ornament, lace, jewelry, &c. The American merchant's wife must return to rigid republican simplicity. One would imagine there was a JONAR preaching repentance, and that the great American Tyre was going literally to clothe herself with sackcloth. There will be allowed Quaker bonnets alone, gowns of the plainest drab stuff, shawls of the same; those wives of the most opulent citizens who are permitted to use silk will have it measured out to them by the Mayor and Corporation. The Legislative Assembly of the State will debate in the next session upon the subject of female dress, and, as soon as a committee has sat, examined witnesses, and made a report on the annual quantity of clothing and ornament which the commercial welfare of the community can spare the ladies, will proceed to lay down permanent restrictions, which will be a model of sumptuary wisdom, and supply an example for the legislation of other countries that may find themselves falling into mercantile confusion. Such is the repentance, not of Nineveh, but of New York, and certainly it is an instance of the same sword that wounded healing. Money is the corriupter, and banlkruptcy is the converter. New York now finds that it has gone astray, that it has departed from the rigid simplicity of its Puritan founders, and it is anxious to return to drab again, in order that it may get rich again. This motive to national penitence would not indeed have satisfied the prophets, and the penance itself appears rather too vicarious a one. The American tradesman repents by deputy in the person of his wife, who, to atone for the luxury and extravagance of the community, is to wear drab. This is rather too much after the model of that medimeval fasting which the landlord performed by the instrumentality of his serfs, and of the Royal rule of chastisemsnt which bound BuCoHAN, the preceptor of the youthful JAes I., whenever the young Prince did anythingwrong, to flog his companion for it. American gallantry will doubtless assert that the gentlemen, after all, will be most severely punished by this severity to the ladies, and that they will feel the reduction of female costume most acutely. But if the gentleman retains all his peculiar luxuries, and only economizes in the dress of his wife and daughters, we shall think that he has a power of consoling himself for the loss of gay colours. But, though the repentance of New York is not a very afflictive one, and though its motive will not bear accurate exa.mination, the very pause to reflect and examine is something. Things are come to a standstill, and there is a general idea that "we have been going too far," and that " we must retrench." The pause is only a short interval in the rulsh of commerce and adventure, but it is stil for the time a sort of repentance-a commercial communing with self-though the fit of penitence will pass off, the rush commence again, and America go on getting, spending, and pausing, and then getting again, to the end of the chapter. Our New York contemporary, however, takes up this question in a gallant rather than a commercial spirit. He does not see why the ladies alone should be blamed for the failure of the New York Banks, and why they should be the only victims of retrenchment. He enters into a very accurate calculation on the subject of silks, furs, and foreign articles of wear, and shows that the ladies have not been at all extravagant:- "Let us see how the matter stands. For the year 1855.6 the importations of silk goods into this country amounted to 25,200,651 dollars,-truly a 'parlous' sum, and a tremendously effective figure of speech for a lecture on the ladies." But he is not overwhelmed by this figure, but prcceeds to examine it. He discovers:- IThat out of these millons of dollars' worth of silk there are oertan ' masculinitiese to be deducted,-vlz, the sleeve and skirt linings of some 4,000, 000 of male coats, all the cravats and waistcoats of silk that the American men from laine to California contrive in a twelvemonth to consume, besides mystical ribands and aprons belonging to orders and lodges, sUken cushions, curins, &c." These deductions leave in his estimate only 23,000,000 dollars to be charged to the ladies. Is this sum, then, an extravagant one ? He decides not. At an average of two dollars per yard, this sum would represent 11,500,000 yards of silk, which, " as a reasonable young lady assures him," would only supply 1,000,000 silk dresses. Now, then, having got the annual number of dresses, we come to the number of the wearers. The United States contain nearly 3,500,000 houses, 1,500,000 of which he considers to represent each an average income of 1,000 dollars a-year--i. e., an incomP which justifies silk. So, these, fifteen hundred thousand families only wear 1,000,000 silk dresses, which is only one silk dress per annum for the whole family, and only that for two-thirds of them. Our contemporary is equally accurate and equally triumphant in his calculation about fur, thread lace, gloves, embroideries, &c. He pleads for a single million of dollars "as a smallsum to spend "on the defence and ornament of the 8,000,000 of "white hands upon which 6,000,000 of adult "male lips kept constantly swearing fealty for 12 "long months." The playful gallantry of our contemporary quite shames the rigidity of the English press. He discovers against the female consumption of fur a gentleman's set-off of 600,000 dollars' worth of that article " imported by " masculine hatters." In the matter of thread lace he can discover no set-off in kind, " though a legend still survives in this " city of a gentlemau whose nuptial gar" ments were made beauteous with borders of "point." But he has instead a set-offof 57 6,000 dollars for fancy firearms. In the same way, against the female embroideries he has a tremendous set-off of nearly 5,000,000 dollars for cigars and lobacco. And, lastly, foreign wines and spirits give an overwhelming balance against the men, and the ladies are brought out triumphant. Our contemporary certainly deserves a bouquet from every lady in Newy York for his championship.
At the Court at Windsor, the 4th day of November, 1857,-Present, the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in Council,-It is this day ordered by Her MIajesty in Council that the Parliament, which stands prorogued to Friday, the 6th day of November inst., be further prorogued to Thursday, the 17th day of December next.

IRELAND. I THE GATHERING OF THE LODGES. (FOM OUR OW2 COOtRRPONDENT) DUBLIN, WDNMSnDAY MOR6Ma. The Grand Lodge of Ireland met yesterday, and, as already indicated, appointed a committee to take the Chancellor's letter and other subjects bearing on the prospects of Orangelam into serious consideration. The attendance yesterday was very full, and comprised some of the lights of the society, such as Lord Dungannon, Sir William Verner, XP., Captain Archdall, M.P., Hon. Colonel Cole, M.P., Sir Harvey Bruce, &c. An evening paper (the Post) asserts that there was a preponderating majority against even entertaining the proposal of dissolution, and adds that a morning journal and certain parties known to be favourable to a dissolution were " denounced as enemies and traitors." As the meeting was strictly "tiled" all this must be regarded as guess work, although the facts are possibly not far from being correctly put by the writer. TIlE LATE MURDER IN TIPXERARY. According to the testimony of private letters the state of Tipperary-at least, the Northern Ridingis not satisfactory. There is no positive clue yet to the assassins of Mr. John EUis, and it is to be feared, from the ill-concealed sympathy of the people with the authors of the crime, that the murder, like too many others originating in the same fruitful source-the possession of land-will remain a mystery, so far as the ends of justice are concerned. The local agitators-lay and clerical-are endeavouring to make it appear that the untimely death of Mr. Ellis should not be classed under the old head of agrarian outrage, and hints are freely thrown outthat to other influences, quite foreign to the one generaUy supposed, must be ascribed the motive which hurried the (alleged) victim of domestic revenge to a bloody grave. It is hardly worth mentioning that these miserable tales do not obtain any credence; the object in circulating them is too transparent to deceive any one. Their truth or falsehood will probably be brought to a test at the forthcoming meeting of magistrates convened by Lord Lismore, as Lieutenant of the county of Tipperary. Although described as "steward" to Mr. Trant, of Dovea, the deceased was in reality the holder of extensive farms, and was in fair circumetances; but having been originaly in the employment of Mr. Trant he continued after he left his service to exercise a general supervision over the property of his former employer. Since the murder of Mr. Ellis there have been several minor outrages of the old character commnitted in the North Riding, but matters have not gone so far but that the incipient revival of agrarianism can be readily crushed out bya prompt display of executive vigour. The time chosen for a general reduction of the Irish constabulary-now that whole towns and villages are denuded of military-was not happy. A little more attention to the circumstances of particular localities would not have been misplaced. Meanwhile the Northern Whig, although published at the opposite end of the kingdom, seems to be familiar with the story which attributes the death of Mfr. Ellis to other causes than these of disputes connected with the possession of land:- " We have reasons for supposin says the Whig) in regard to the case of the unfortunate hlr. Elis that laud, and in its traditional disputes, may have had nothing to do with the horrible murder. It may be as reasonably referred to for other causes. Why is it supposed in this country, when a murder takes place, and the unfortunate victim is a landed proprietor, that revenge for harah acts as a landlord has been the inducement ? We have heard of landlords shot by outraged husbands; and there certainly are immoralmen who are not bad landlords. In the neighbourhood where this last atrocity was committed pnbllc opinion does not altogether pronounce in favour of the theory of agrarian outrage." The Lords Justices have offered a reward of 1001. for the discovery of the murderer or murderers. RIBA,NDISM In W.ATH. A letter dated Eells, Monday, and published in a morning paper, contains the following particulars of a dreadful outrage on the person of a respectable farmer. A local journal states that Mr. Connell has died of his wounds, but this fortunately is doubt- ful:- " Perhaps the most audacious and savage outrage that has ever disgraced this hitherto peaceable county was perpetrated on Sunday morning last, about U o'clock, on the per. son of Mr. Richatd Connell, of Robinstown, and his family, vwithin a short distance of his own house. From what I can learn Mr. Connell, with hlis mother and sister, was returning from Kilakeir Chapel, after attending early service, on an outside car, when they were met by a party of five men, who all came out of a field. Two of the party stopped the horse, while the other three attacked Connell with sticks and loaded-handled whips. The first blow must have stunned him, as he never left the car; but while sitting, or after he had fallen back, he received several blows in quick succession, immediateiy in the front of the head. After giving their unfortunate victim, who is a highly respectable farmer, what they thought sufficient, the party decamped across the fields as they carme. On reaching home, Dr. Duignam, of htullingar, and Mr. Grey, of lRells, were quickly in attendance, and, upon examination, discovered that the poltion of bone over one of the eves was completely shattered and driven in, and altogether hehadreceived n wards of a dozen dangerous wounds. Mrs. Connell, wno, in her parental solicitude for her son, attempted to save him, received several blows on her head, which is also seriously cut. The sister, who I suppose was on the opposite side of the car, escaped uninjure None of the party are known to the women, who, perhaps, were too much frightened at the moment to recognize them, and more especially as the attack and attempted assassination did not oscupy many seconds. The injured man is too ill up to the present to be questioned very closely on the subject; but should he be spared he may be able to Identify some of the party. Upon the news of the outrage reaching Kells, Sub-inspector Gullen, of the constabulary, immediately departed to the house, where he was joined by Mr. Supple, s.I., from Athboy. These two offlicers are actively engaged tring to discover the perpetrators of this cowardly attack, but up to the present no arrest has been made. at second service in l lskeir chapel, I understand, the of ficiating priest spoke on the subject, and emphatically denounced the system of Ribendismn, from which those oc. curzences spring." THE- PRESSUn7R ON THE BANKS. The WVaterford MlIait has the annexed statement with respect to the continued run for gold on the National Bank in that city:- " We learn with some surprise that a partial run has taken place on the National Bank here, and princi pally of those resident in the coumty of Kilkenny, and were no less surprised to hear that somie of those who applied for gold sald they were recommended to do so by ;a gentleman who was named, who is a man of some position, and, by a rather strange coincidence, a party who applied in New Ross for gold mentioned the same name, aud said he had recommended him to withdraw his money. Whether this person meant it as a practical joke, or whether he really intended to create a panlic, we are not informed, but in either case we think his conduct was criminal and culpable. The position of the National Bank is so secure that it cannot fear any run that may be upon it, and so far from seeking to extend its circalation it is trying to curtail It; and we think anyone -who for the in. dulgence of a whim or joke seeks to disturb the monetary condi'ion of a distrlct, and to alarm those who have placed their money in a bank, is deserving of condign punishment." The Belfast Mercury states that the suspension of the house of Thornton and Co., of Manchester, caused some uneasiness respecting the firm of Thornton, Ewing, and Co., of Belfast, on the supposition that the establishments were identical or connected. Such, it appears, is not the fact, the Belfast finr not having any partnership connexion whatever with the Manchester house. DBATH OF LORD CHARLES BUTLER. The Kilkenmy papers of this day announce the sudden demise of Lord Charles Wandesforde Butler, which took place on Friday at the residence of his mother, the Dowager Marchioness of Ormond, Marley, Rathfarnham. Immediately after breakfast on Friday morning his Lordship complained of feeling faint, and retired to his bedroom; the servant hearing him call at once went up, and found him lying on the floor, suffering from an apoplectic seizure.

THE LEVIATRATL7 ,ATEAMSfLtIP. A very general impression seemed tI prevail ambong tE* visitors to the attempted launch of Tnuday that the effoTt to get the vessel off wonld be renewed witir scooe3s in the course of yeeterdaY. Notwithstanding tIz rain, therefore, which fell with unmitigated severity throngbaut the day, & number of per-ons proceeded to the buildlngyardp but it is almost needless to say that, beyond seeing ter gigantic vessel, wvhich, high in the air, loomed like a da.oclottd iu the thick mist, nothing was doing to repay the to8 of a visit to 3illwall. Except where some of the unfinished sdoens have been converted into joiners' shops for the purpose of proceeding more rapidly with the internal fittings of the cabins, no work was going forward on the vesseL All around her was still and silent, and gave a most desolate aspect to a soene formerly always so resonant with the nob9 and bustle occasioned by the toil of nearly 2,000 men. After it was determinea to cease all further efforts to effect the launch on Tuesday the workmen were employed throughout the night in taking proper precautions to secure the vessel in the position in which she at present rests. For this purpose powerful timber shores were fixed under her stem and stern beyond where the cradles support her,and the massive check tackle which secures her on the side towards the land has also been hauled taut, so that, as faras human ingenuity can foresee, there is no mechanical possibility of her now slipping and launching herself without notice. As might have been anticipsted, the most vague and contradictory rumours are alloat as to the cause which led to Tuesday's failure. Only two of these are sufficiently probable to demnd notice. The first states that in consequence of the immense pressure and friction the iron trans. verse bars which cross the bottom of the cradles have cut into the railway metals, and so fixed the whole that It will be immovable unless the entire vessel can be raised up from the launching ways and started afresh. For this report we are glad to say the result of a close inspection of the bars leaves no foundation. In fact, the friction, considering the amount of pressure on the cradles and bars, seems to have been marvelously slight. The second report avers most positively that the launching ways themselves have settled down under the weight of the ship's stern and fixed it as it were in a hole. This also Is incorrect, for the ways remain as firm andrigidas ontho first day of their construction, and up to the present they have received no cause to be otherwise, since the vessel is still in its original foundations. But the ways have been so con. atructed as to allow for a silking. Each " way" of 120 feet wide is formed by three spans of 40 feet each-the spans resting each upon rows of piles, and rising in the centre l1in., so that a considerable deprestion is provided against. The real cause of the failure on Tuesday was the accident which took place at the windlass, and which made the whole mass of workmen ao tinid and suspicions that it was actually unsafe to intrast them with the execution of details which pre-eminently demanded coolness and judg. ment. From the same timidity, also, and from prudential motives, it was considered better after the accident to remove the men from the barges which were moored in, the river, and worked the hauling tackle upon the midships of the vesseL These four barges were capable of applying a downward strain on the Leviathan of 250 tons, which strain was chiefly depended upon to move her in the case of the hitch which did take place. When the second attempt was made without the aid of these barges an undue strain came upon the chains which, fastened at the bow and stern, pulled towards the river, and at last the former broke. This, coupled with the accident to the pin of the hydraullc press, stopped the launoh, The Leviathan at present rests exactlt six inches lower than formerly, and, taking the mean of her progress fore and aft, about four feet down the launching ways. According to the incline of these ways, the actual lowerlg of the vessel since she moved is only four inches, but when the cradles were fixed under her and the last supports removed she settled down two inches in the cradles themselves. From the levels taken it appeathat the deflection in the whole lengthof the shipsinceshe wasleft to support herself in the two cradles is so slight as to be almost im"erceptible. From the forward cradle to the bows the defection is some fractional part of an inch; between the two cradles amidsbips none whatever is perceptible; and from the aftermost cradle to the stornpost, where more than 200 feet of the heaviest parts of the vessel hang entirely without support from the ground, the deflection is only half an inch. From the deock the entire deflection from stem to stern, nearly 700 feet, is only one inch. We believe that the arrangements for finally launching the colossal structure on the 2d of December will not differ in any essential particular from the method pursued on Tuesday last, but we can speak more positively as to this in the course of another day. Daring yesterday .r. Brunel and the great ship's great captain, the most indefatigable and zealous of all commanders (Captain Harrison), were down at lsillwall, inspecting the shio, and aesertained that she was neither strained nor twisted even to the exteut of the most fractional portion of an inch. The men injured by the accident at the windlass are all progressing slowly, though still no hope exists of therecovery of Donovan, and Staceyremains in a precarious state. Some idea of the frightful violence with which these poor men were strack may be formedfrom the fact that one of the massive handles of the windlass, of solid iron 1 inches in diameter, which struck the men, iS bent and twisted as if it was formed of lead
MILITARY AND NA FAL INTELLIGENCE. Xesterday the members of the general courtmartial which was recently held at Chatham for the trial of Lieutenant-Colonel J.

Ellis, 1st battalion, officiated as Deputy Judge-Advocate. Yesterday an inspection of the troops attached to the invalid establishment, Chatham, took place at St. Mary's Barracks, when the names of 48 non-commissioned officers and mern belonging to various cavalry and infentry regiments were read by Adjutant J. Pope, an order having been received from the War-office for their immediate discharge, owing to their unfitness for further service. The invalids, with their wives and famflies, will leave Chatham this morning. A detachment of 30 rank and file of the Royal Artillery, in charge of twonon-commissioned officers, left Woolwich yesterday morning for Southampton, there to embark for Corfu, to fill up vacancies in the artilery companies at that station. The auxiiiary steam-transport Indomitable arrived at the Royal Arsenal pier, Woolwich, yesterday to prepare for the embareation of a siege train and two companies of Artillery for India.

A melancholy awcident occurred during the passage, which has deprived the service of a gallant and rising yoUng officer -Ensign R. N. Luard-who, while in his cabin on the 27th uit., was thrown by the heavy rollng of the vessel into a passage below, dislocating his neck. Death was instantaneous. His remains were committed to the deep on the 28th with military honours. The troops are in excellent health, and will proceed by railway to Shorneliffe.

PRBESENTATION of Ute FREEDOM of the CITY to the DUKE of CAMBRI.DGE. Yesterday, at a Special Court of Common Council, the fredom of the City was presented to his Royal Highness 'the Duke of Cambridge, together with a splendid sword. The prentation took place at 5 'clock in the GuildhaU, 'vhich had been most tastefully fitted up for the occasion by 3fr. Bunning, the city architect. In the centre, and ia front of a gallery which had bearn erected for ladies at the eastern end of the hail, was placed the chair for the Lord Mayor, and inmediately on his Lordship's left a chair of -tate for his Royal HiAhness, composed of crimson velvet -.nd gold, with the arms of the Dnke emblazoned in gold on 'the back of the chair. On elther side of the Lord Malyor were seats for the -aldermen and distinguished guests. Galleries for the members of the Common Council were fixed on the north aud south sides of the hall, the front of which were decorated with emblems of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the a3ath, and coronets of the Duke. Inthree gaUeries, surrounding the aldermen and Common Council, were raised seats for the accommodation of ladies, and in front of the eastern llallery seats for the ladies of the aldermen. The western *wndow hacd in its centre a beautiful glass star from Messrs. 4Jopeland's, beneath and around which were festoons and trophies of flags. In the centre of the eastern window was a portrait of his Royal Highness, surrounded by a trophy composed of ilagp of various nations, interspersed with the :Royal standard and colounrs of the Grenadier Guards. The galleries and the compartments on the north and sonth sides of the hall were decorated with trophies of flags, shields, and 'wreaths, and in front of the northern gallery was placed a :medallioi of Her Majesty in gold. From the large cornices of the hail were suspended flags of all nations, and from the ceiuing two large chandeliers composed of painted and cutglass drope. By 4 o'clock every available seat was occupied, and the Ospectacle when the lighting of the hall was complete was grand and imposing. The Turkish Ambassador was one of the earHest arrivals. There was a large number of distinguiheid officers present, whose names wilU be found In the 'report of the proceedings at the banquet at the Mansionihouse in the evening. The Dake of Cambridge on entering the hall was most loudly cheered. His Royal llighness having signed the declaration presented to him was then addressed by the Chamberlain, Sir JOIIN KEY, in the following words:- "The connezion so long existing between your Royal :Eighness and this ancient cornoration, honoured as one of its most respectable companies (the Merchant Taylors) is by having your namai enrolled as its oldest arnd most esteemed honorary member, and your presence at a recent, and long to be remembered meeting of the Court, when it tendered the expression of its respect to a Prince illustrious iby personal character, and about to become more llUustrious by an alliance which would ennoble the proudest ancestry and add grace to the most brilliant ithrone, would seem to supersede the necessity of dwelling npon the nature of that distinction which you have signified your pleasure to accept at our hands to-day. From what transpired on that occasion you would perceive that it is in no light estimation we hold the honours of our civic guild; that we use nothing of an apologetic tone in presenting them, but have a confident persuasion that rank, however illustrious-talents, however distinguished-services, however transcendent or enduring, will find in the freedom *of this city a distinction which extends their celebrity, and a privilege which enhances their reward. It is wander 'he fulness of this conviction we have invited sour Royal Highness here to-day, We felt how acceptable it would be to you to cast in your historic lot with the great spirits of the past-with Chatham, with Pitt, with Nelson. with Wellington, with Beckford-men whose names are on our enrolments,whose busts are upon our walls, but whose deeds have a more imperishable monument still in the shrine of the nation's heart. (Cheers.) We know your Royal Highness's estimate of rank, of birth, of near connexion with Royalty. You esteemed those things great according as the conduct of their possessor made them great -as they were adorned by the graces of character, as they ,were turned to the account of a nation's happiness, as in the beneficent purposes for which they were employed there was sure to be reflected upon them a brighter lustre than they gave; inasmuuch that, if I were to select a designation most welcome to your ears now, and most likely to go down with history to other times, it would be, not the illustrious prince, but the useful public servant,-not the monarch's kinsman, but the humblest soldier's frdend. (Cheers.) The soldier's friend, I said, and the very name leads us back to a passage in our nation's life charaoterized by more checkered incidents, calling up more of mingled feeling destined to be referred to hereater, with stronger alternations of pride and shame than &,ay event in the annals of history. And yet, Sir, I believe I give utterance to the sentiments of this Coustwhen,in any retrospect we take of the late war, I say the uppermoost feelings of an Englishman's heart should be those of permitted elation, heartfelt thankfulness, and honest pride. Mistakes there were of economy, of admninistrative role, of nnpraotised generalship, such as might have been looked Tor, perhaps, in the people of a land which had had rest for 40 years; but still, of dishonour to our flag, of stain upon our sword, of shadow of reproach upon the stoutness of the EngUsh heart or the indomsitableness of the English will, no trace ever appeared from the first landing of our troops at Gallipoli to the firing of the last shot against the shattered fortress of Sebastopol. (Loud cheers.) It is evident we owed, tuder God's blessing, our successes to the valiant spirit of the many,-our losses only to the mismanagement of the few. The characteristic of the English soldiery is to lean with unquestioning confidence upon those who lead them, ready to rush upon destruction, if destruction be set before them, in the wish to cover any error on their general's part by a doubled measure of intrepidity on their own; and by this intrepidity, by God's blessing, we conquered; for as a Christian nation we lmust ever bear in mind that even the consummate skill and unrivalled generalship of a Wellington, with the indomitable courage and spirit of British soldiers, would without God's blessing be of no avail. Of the part sustaiued by your Royal Highness in this ever memorable campaign it would not become me to speak particularly. Nor is it needful. The tidings used to reach IIs through that widely diffused organ of public opinion which morning by morning announced to its million zeaders the privations of our country's brave. The whole scone was brought befbre us by a pen as fearless in its exposure of abuses as it was unsurpassed by the vividness of its graphic power; and in the midst of that scene, wherever difficulties were to ba faced, or dangers were to be shared, or hardships were to be endured, wherever the countenance of a noble presence was needed to decide the wavering, or the sympathies of a feeling heart were required to sustain and comfort the distressed, we saw your Royal Highness. (Loud cheers.) We followed you in imagination through that eventful night, the frat spent by our troops on Crimean soil, when in tentless and unsheltered misery you lay exposed to the night-long storm. (Prolonged cheering.) We realized the sound of your voice on the victorious heights of Alma, calling attention to the flying enemy and heartening the exhausted troops in their work ; while, -when we saw you in the thick of that murderous fire at Inkermann, more than half your noble guards lying dead or wounded upon the field, a body of Russians singling you out :for vengeful and deliberate aim, and even your faithful bone struck from under you, we confess to having felt a national pride in Rloyalty that he who so nobly led on Eugland's armies was so nearly allied to England's Queen. It seems, therefore, needless to say how entirely our gracious Sovoreign carri-d with her the sufftages of her loving subjects when in the selection of a fitting person to occupy the highest military position in the country she was led to tha nomination of your Royal Highness. How little hereditary preferenices would be permitted to influence this choice, uow little the prestige accorded as of right to one in your Royal Highness's position, how little any consideration save a desire to promote the honour, the happiness, the elaniency of her beloved army, let any man tell who has ever heard of the deep emotion of the Monarch at the story of her toldiers' sufferings, or who has ever listened to the loud culburst of grateful and loving loyalty when sOldier8 are gathered rouad their Queen. (Cheers.) Yes, Sir, you were designated by yourltoyal mistress to your exalted oflice because she would that he who was to hear rule in military affairs should he one who could sympathize Witil braveryv ha ha --- . . .. W.vI Draery naanadexperience of hardship, who could lend a helping hand to struggling merit, could renieniber past services and reward them; ant already are both the ariny and the country reaping the first fruits of this wiLs selection. We see in our military councils a vigour of purpose, a discrimination of character, a breadth of plan anid object in the educational arrangements, and a considerate regard for the Circuimstances of the lowest subaltern, which, if permitted to be carried out, will caune the British soldier to be as much respected for his high ;toned moral deportment in the barr3cks as for his fearless nnd undaunted spirit in the field. 2 or can I conclude without adverting to another feature of your Royal Highness's -public services likely to elicit strong feelings of admiration groem the s;memnbers of this Court-I allude to thle active, vigilant, painstaking Interest you have evinced i those noble institutions which have made our country as preeminent for her moral ashievements a5 she is unrivaUed for the glory of her arms. England, Sir, in the orderings of a moral Providence has a great mission to fulfil. If she is to wage war abroad with the despot, the oppressor, with the man wrho would encroach upon European liberties or roll back the waves of an advancing civilization, she is also to wage war at home with sin, and misery, and snffering,vith the incursions of ignorance upon our national institu-tions, or the inroads of poverty upon our social happiness. Her two types of patriotism are the soldier and the phUAnthropist, tbe defender of our liberties and the benefaetor of our howts, and we tender our respect to you in both capacities. I am commissioned to present to you both the badge of citizenship and the ensign of war. Honouring your Royal Highness as we do for all those personal qualities you have displayed in material warfate, we must honour gou yet more for the inherited partiality with which vour desire to beidentified with the noblest achievements of Chris-tian philanthropy,-for your wish that the school, the hbopital, and the asylum should never be dissociated from your bhonoured name, and that anything you may be able to do - your country in discipliuipg her cons to the uso of agsa may be eclipsed by yet aobler services in the cause of charity and In the arts of peace (Cheering.) The Duke of CAxBRiWDF, who on rising was received with loud and prolonged cheering, said,-My Lord Mayor, It becomes my duty to express to your Lordship and this Court my sense of the honour which has just been conferred upon me iR suoh flattering terms by the city of London. Gentlemen, I can assure you that I am deeply sensible of the compliment and the distinction paid to me, and although I do not for one moment think that I have any right to be mentioned with the illustrious names which have been brought under your notice by the kindness and favour of the Chamberlain who has just addressed you, the very fact of my name being coupled with such men as a Chatham, a Nelson, or a Wellington, in itself constitutes a distinction of which any man, whatever his feelings may be, may, I think, be justly proud. (Cheera.) My Lord Mayor, I naturally ask myself how it is that I have attained the proud distinction which has thus been conferred upon me by my fellow-citizens of the metropolis of London-I think I may fairly say one of the greatest, if not the greatest commercial city in the world. Gentlemen, I have merely performed my duty to the best of my ability. (Cheers.) From the commencement of my career I have endeavoured to do so, and it is the simple performance of that duty which has now placed me in the proud position in vfhich I feel myself-not alone as the head of the army, through the favour of my Sovereign, but at this moment as your honoured guest, as a fellow-citizen of the CitiZenJ of London. (Lond cheering.) But, gentlemen, I cannot but thinkthat in placing thisgreat, this distinguished mark of your good opinion upon myself as an individual, it has occurred to the citizens of London that in doing honour to me they were at the same time paying me the greatest compliment in their power bg paying a compliment to the honour of the army. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I never can forget that, although individually from a sense of duty I may have obtained the esteem, the affeotion, and the regard of my fellowcitizens and of the country, it is to the army that I owe the high and distinguished position in which I feel myself placed. (Cheers.) Therefore, any compliment that the citizens of London are disposed to pay to the army, if it is in my person, I can only esteem as a double and a most gracefulfavour. (Cbeers.) Gentlemen, it will hardly be expected on your part, and it would il become me if I ventured in any respect to allude to the very limited and humble services which I have performed on various occasions in different parts of the world. The worthy Chamberlain has alluded to those services in terms which I really think go beyond the merit which they deserve. (criesof "No, no!'), for after all what I have done is that which would be done by, I think, any one who had the feelings of a man and who had the interests and the honour of his country at heart. (Mtuch cheering.) I therefore pass over those events, which have now become matters of history, and which will, no doubt, be recorded in their proper light for ages to come. That I should have had the advantage-the honour of participating in these great events, I certainly now look back upon as one of the greatest plea. sures and one of the greatest satisfactions that I can possibly experience. But such as these services were they certainly were not of a character to place me alone in the proud position in which find myself, for I venture to hope that In various other ways I have also deserved and obtained the esteem and the approbation of my fellow.cltizens. From an early period, taking the example of one most dear to myself-most dear, I believe, to the citizens of Londonmy honoured father (cheers), I have endeavoured on all occasions to assist and promote as far as I could the interests and the welfare of my fellow-citizens and those unfortunate persons of various grades In life who call for the assistance and support of their neighbours and fellow-kinsmen. The endeavour, I am glad to find, has been in many respects successful; in every respect I have met with the hearty and the zealous support of the citizens of London. As far as I can I shall continue, in spite of the very different position in which I am placed, to add my mite and my humble endeavour to the furtherance of the great institutions, not only of this metropolis, but of the country at large. (Cheers.) I have been a member for some time of one of the greatest corporate bodies of the oity -the Merchant Taylors-who by a deputation have this day done me the honour of introducing meato the Lord Mayor-a compliment which I highly prize. I am gratified to be a member of that body. I have the further gratification of being at the head of one of the noblest institutions of this metropolis. (Hear, hear.) I assure you, gentlemen, that although I am a soldier in heart and love the army I confess I have the deepest interest and affection for my young friends over whom I preside at Christ's Hospital. (Cheers.) I am merely stating these things to prove that a maus although a soldier may at the same time be a citizen, and I trust that from being a soldier he is not on that account a less good citizen. I, therefore, hope that his Lordship wiUl find thet the honour, the high compliment wbich he with the citizens of London has conferred upon me they wil not have reason to lament, for I assure them that they will find me just as devout, as obedient, and as good a citizen as they have complimented me upon being a soldier. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I again repeat that the honour that has been conferred upon me is one of which any man may be justly proud whatever his station or position in life; that I nan justly proud of that honour ; that I am confident from the kind expressions wlich I receive from all quarters that that honour is conferred upon me not because of the official position which I occupy, but because,in various ways and through the advantages which I have durived, I have been enabled to obtain the esteem, the affection, and the regard of my fellow-countrymen. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, it is upon these conditions chiefly that I feel proud in finng i myself placed In that position, and it Is my anxious hope anid desire as long as I continue a public man that I shal continue to merit the favour of my Sovereign and the approbation of the country; and my anxious desire will be to promote by every means in my power the efficiency and the renown of the army, so that when I lay down my rule I may feel the conviction that I have done my dutv to the country, and that I have not given up the important trust committed to mny hands in a less efficient state than when it was first confided to me. (Cheers.) My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I am highly flattered by the distinction that has been conferred upon me,and shall never forget to the last days of my life the kindness and cordiality of my reception by the citizens of London. (His Royall Highness resumed his seat amid loud and prolonged cheering.) The sword was a chaste and magniticent weapon, rich in design, yet finished with such good taste and care as to be in all respects within the limits assigned to regulation swords of General officers. The handle was of carved ivory, studded with carbuncle-the hilt of gold, riohly chased, and set with uncut enieralds and briliants. On the cross of the hilt were the insignia of a Field-Marshal in brDliants, surrounded with a wreath of oak leaves and acorns, formed by emeralds and brilliants, beautifully set. On the scabboard was the Duke's cipher in brilliants, and the city arms carved in carbuncle, and set with rubies. On the blade was Inscribed,- " The freedom of the city of London, together with this sword, was presented to hbl Royal lighne3 the Duke of Cambridge, K.G., Commauder-in-Chlet of the Brtish ahmy, by the Corporation ef London. in teotimony or their hS h estimation of his distInguIshed character sud servlces. A-D. 1857." On the scabbard, amid elaborate chasings, which showed such finished workmanship as only comes from Hancock's of Bruton-street, were inscribed the words-" Alms, Balaklava, Inkermann, and Sevastopol. The Duke of Cambridge shook bands with the Lord Mayor, the Lady Mayoress, Alderman Wire, Alderman iRose, a.nd many of the distinguished visitors by whom he was surrounded, and left the hall amid hearty acclamations to roceed to the dinner at the Mansion-house. 1he arrangements connected with the fitting up of the hall were intrusted to the City Lands Commnittee, of which Mr. R. C. Buicknall is chairman, and were iu every respect uinoxceptlonable. The Dake of Cambridge and his suite were inet at Temple-bar by the Master and Wardens of the Merchant Taylors Company, and conducted to GuildhalL THE BArNIQUET. In the evening the Lord Mayor entertalned the Duke of Cabridge at the Mansion-house, where a numerous and distinguQihed circle of guests assembled to meet his Royal Highness. A magnificent banquet was provided in the Egyptian-hall, which was decorated with great taste. On the right of the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress were his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, Lady Stratford de Bedoliie, the Turkish Ambassador, Mrs. Tremenheere, the Earl of Cardigan, the American Minister, General Sir Hew Rloss, G.C.B.1; the SiameSe Ambassadors,; MajorGeneral Sir G.

The LORD MAYOR gave the healths of "The Queen,' "the Prince Consort and the rest of the Royal Family," which were received with the usual honours. IHis LoRDSHImPthen proposed "TheAkrmy and Navy," and coupled with the toast the name of the Dnke of Cambridge, obberving, with reference to the Indian mutiny, that by the exertions of his Royal Highness, as Comniander-ir-Chief, upwards of 40,000 men had already been sent out to maintain the honour of the British flag in our Indian pmses- sions. The Duike of CAsiBP.IDoE, who was received wibh loud cheers, said,-Nly Lord Mayor, my lords, ladies, andgentlemen, I rise to respond to the toast which your Lordship has been so good as to give, and with which you have done me the honour of coupling my name. It is an honour which I always value and appreciate. I have the greatast. delight in saying that I love the army. (Cheers.) I have been bred and born a soldier, and amy c mpliment thatjyon pay to the army I feel a personal compximent to n4self. (Cheers.> I think we have a rieh's-i I may ventwsto say so-to.'oe proud and to be satisfied with ourselves. We have passed through a great santes-i which has, boeome a matier of history; and we are, now engaged, M:Nssrious stru%gle the details of which, are looked for wih, the utmoes interest when news arw3 es fmm-r disbnt, possessions ia the East. I do nc, b.-Atev-m-. we i ira.ty wZ.L T tlat tbz. army have not performed their duty nobly in our Indian possessions. (Cheers.) The acts of valour and sf-devotion we hear of in India may wel! make ibis country feel proud of her sons who are there defending her cause. (Cheers.) This circumstance leads me to a subject which I have on various occasions brought under the, notice of meetings such as this ina the city of London as well as elsewhere-I mean the efficient maiatenance of our nilitary establishments. I was very mach gratified to hear your Lordship say-and I am sure you only expressed the feelings of our fellowcountrymen -that the city of London was very ready to support the authorities in any necessary demands which they might make for this purpose. (Cheers.) We are not an aggressive country. We do not wish to be an aggressive country. Our army is not an aggressive army, and therefore I have no hesitation in speaking of the efficiency of that army in the presence of many distingtished foreigners who might otherwise think that my observations implied a feeling inimical to other Powers. Nothing of the sort. I only wish to Impress upon the country the neCoSsity of keeping up an efficient army for the necessary and legiti. mate service of the State,-such an army as a great empire like England ought always to maintain. See, my Lord Mayor and gentlemen, in what a position our army has been placed! See what has occmrned irL India ! What certainly we had no reason to expect. No human being could have anticipated the events which have taken plaee in that quarter of the world; but when I look at the number of European troops in India it is a marvel to me-it must be a marvel to everybody-how so small a proportion of European soldiers could have held their own as they have done, and conld have carried on the extensive warlike opmrations in which they have been engaged. (Cheers.) Now, ar we doing justice to our army or to ourselves if we place our troops in so important and at the saine time so dangerous a position? (Cheers.) Surely as an act of humanity to the troops we employ it is only right they should be maintained iu sufficient force and efficiency to uphold the interests of the empire. I ask whether the events which have recently occurred in India ought not to induce us to open our eyes and to look a little ahead, and never again to allow the interests of the empire to be so seriously endangered. The Lord Mayor has been good enough to allude to my exertions as eommander-in-chief, in conjurction with my colleagues, in despatching a large aud efficient body of troops to India. I take no credit to myself, but I certainly flatter myself that the Government of this country have used every means in their power to provide for the support of our troops in India. (Cheers.) The country has appreciated, and will continue to aIpeciate, those efforts ; but I still maintain that it is a dangerous experiment to allow our East Indian possessions to he placed under the guardianship of so small a number of European troops as have hitherto been main. tained there. It is said, bowever, "Oh, you cannot hold India by military power; you mast hold it by moral power." I certainly should never pretend, in any society of Englishmen, that we could maintain so vast an empire as that of Indla by militaty power; but what we as military men expect is that the civil government of the country-the moral infldence that we are legitimately exercising-shall be backed by such an amtount of military force that when a great exigency arises that force shal not alone be able to defend Itel, but to defend the Government of the country. (Cheers.) We are nowjholding India by military force alone,whicb, ha fact, is nothing more nor less than moral force backed by a sufficiency of military force. It is said that the question as to how the mutiny is to be put down is one of great difficulty. A great, a fearful catastrophe has occurred. I hope no one would suggest that we shoald mow indiscriminately right and left; that wye should burn villages; and that we should destroy their inhabitants. Such a proceeding would be suicidaL But, on the other hand, I concelve that no man, whatever may be his views of humanity, can maintain that a body of mutinous soldiers is to be permitted to stroll from one end of the vast empire of India to the other, and that when the muainy is suppressed they are to be treated as If they had donenowrong. ("No, no.") lam persuadedthat noEnglish. man would entertain such an opinion. I am convinced that there is no humanity in such sentiments, and that some misapprehension must have existed with regard to the feelings and ideas attributed to persons in authority on this subject. I am happy to have the opportunity of saying what I was very anLious to state, that there is no truth whatever in a report I have seen that my excellent and gallantfriendthe Commander-in-Chief in India, Sir ColinCampbell, andthe Governor-Generalof India are not on goodterms, I have a letter from my friend in which he alludes to this report having been circulated, and he distinctly and positively denies that the slightest difference had occurred between them. But it is not for me to enter farther into this Indian business, because, in the first place, I labour under a great disadvantage in not having been in India myself, and the observations I have made have only been formed on what I may venture to call common sense, and are such as any man whether he has been in India or not, and whatever his position in life, might alao have been led to make. With regard to the native arnmy Ican only refer to the conduct of the European officers, andl feel it adutytosay in thepresenceof someofmyfriends who entertain strong personal feelings on this subject, that everything I have heard has been highly to the credit of the Company's officers (cheers), whose only fault in my opinion has been that on too many occasions they have from their constant intercourse with the native troops been led to repose too much confidence in them. I am sorry to say that one of the first victims to this fearful catas. trophe was a very near relative of my esteemed friend the Lord Mayor; and it is only a just tribute to that gallant officer and to the officers of the Indian army that I as Commander-in-Chief should say that it appears to me their conduct has been moet excellent, and that their only fault has been too great a coifidence in their men. What is to become of that army and how It is in future to be conducted is a very difficult question, and one which it wiU require much time and reflection to solve. It would evidently be improper for mo to allude further to the subject on this occasion. I think, however, there cannot be two opinions as to whether we must have a native army in India in addition to an Europsan army. It ought, certainly, to be only an auxiliary army, I have already expressed my sentiments with regard to the honour which has been conferred upon me to-day. SimUlar honours have been conferred upon several of my brethren in arms who are here present for gallant and distingaished Eervices. Such honours are not confined to mere social position in the country, but are open to every officer who has had an opportunity of disting'uishIng himself and gaining the approbation of his fellow-citizens. I can assure you thtat such compliments are highly valued by us. They are most acceptable, and it is a great error to suppose that the reciplents are ungrateful. I am persuaded that where citizens and soldiers are united the better is it for the country. We are not a nation of conscripts, but I am happy to say that we are far more of a military nation than perhaps many of the conscript countries. (Cheers.) Whenever a necessity arlses In this country a military spirit is evoked. I have on a former occasion taken the opportunity of stating how admirably the deficiency in the army was filled up by the voluntary system of recruiting. That recruiting has not fallen off since I mnade this observation; on the contrary, it has rather increased, low can it be said that an army so constituted can be raised in a country which Is not military? E3ngland must and ought to thrive; for while she regards the arts of peace as the most valuable and the most essential for the interests not of herself alone, but of bumanity and the world, she does not forget that when occasion requires the miilitary spirit of her people can be easily aroused, and is always ready to restore the equilibrium of the world, and to bring about that happy period when the blessings of peace may be enjoyed. Such I believe to be the feeling of the country, and whUe I have the honour to fill the high position in which my Sovereign has placed me it will be my earnest desire to promote not only the interests of the army, but the establishment of a cordial friendship between the military and eivil portions of the community. (Cheers.) Sir S. LuSHINGTOmN returned thanks on behalf of the Navy. The LoRD sMAYOR then gave "the Foreign Ambassadors.") The TURXIS1 MIXIsTrER (M. Musurus) briefly returned thanks, expressing the sympathy of the Sultan towards the B13itish nation, and his detestation of the atrocities committed by the rebellious Sepoys in India. The AnunrmAx MINISTER said,-My Lord Mayor, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,-The distinguished member of the diplomatio body who has just addressed this meeting has discharged his duty so ably, in a language not familiar to all, thatl had hoped while he was proceeding I should be spared the necessity of inflicting upon you another address. At the suggestion, however, of the Lord Mayor, and feeling desirous of explaining two or three thoughts that have passed through my mind in the course of the present day, I ask your attention for a few snoments. You all know that I represent a Republic, the constitution of which forbids to its Government the crcation or adoption of kings, princes, peers, or lords,-not that it proscribes individuals who may be in other lands eminently entitled to those high-sounding titles. You wIll perceive, therefore, that circumstanees connected with my uniform Republican rearing and; educatioa have in a measare unfittea me for -what at--first -a-ppeared the interesting and appropriate ceremorny of to- day. ((:heers.) There is one rule that is eqr,ualIy pplicabte to all countries, let the system of policy e8 what it may, and that rule I wall take upon myself to extrai from the filth on the list of the great English poets- Honour and shame from no condition rlse, Act well yoar part, there all the honour lies. (Cheers.) It was mainly on that admirable and universaDy recognized principle that, to my delight, I sawrthe ceremony of tlis day conducted. I can well imagine thea a peasant or a yeoman, "acting well his part,"' might find in the5 acclamations of his countrymen and the applause of those under whom he had served, " where aU ths honour lies." 1 can imagine that even a prince may be a working patriot. (cheers)-that he may devote his high intellez, his enorgy. of mind and body to the zealous and persevering disch2age of important and interesting public deies. (Cheers) I. can imagine, as I have said, that even as. pince may be so littl dazzled by tbeluiminous atmosphere in which he moves as to be able to see and to distinguish a meritorious cainrade in th3 obscurcst ranks of the prfatie force ; and I can imagine that even a prince, not bound by the diguity of cbief command, may, at a mome%it of State exigency,. sound with his breath the bugle for recruits. These wne things, that, Republican as I ams, I ca- A imagine possible. Whether tbe imagining in your better >rnewledge of men and things can be made a fact among Br' tish princes it Is bt for mo to determine. I am not one cj the jury for thOtrial of that fact. I am, as I have said, a stranger. You me the pauel, and if you find that they a happens to be amnong British princes one of whom all t' ese imaginings of mine in reference to Individual merit, become a plain fact, why your finding as jurors of such a verdict would ha conclusive upon the judgment of those who hear it. (Cheers.) Rleference has been made this evening to one or two points to v hich I may be allowed to allude. Sympathy has been invoked from foreign nations in reference to the state of affair in India. I am not here to speak as to the extent to veh1ch my Government or the people of the United States eyinpathize with the struggle of England aFamInet India. T hat is not the thought I wish to express. te thought f aat I wish to express is in referes:ee to Stp Ureatment that is to bI dealt; tO those who have distinguished themsdres in the field of crime iri that unhappy region. Now, crimes are of vious descriptions. Mutiny andmarder are heavy crlmes; they Are dark and gloomy crimes; but they are crimes Known to us all, and they are crimes committed in almost every commanity and under almost every Government. Penalties are specifically provided for these crimes in the respective criminal codea of various countries. Let such crimes be punished wherever they occur according to the law. That is the fiint and clearest principle of action. But there are other crimes-crimes, at least, of another character-which become so monstrous as to assutme the attitude of enmity to the human race ; not merely crimes committed with reference to the power of India, not merely crimes inimical to England, not merely crimes inimical to Europe and its civilization, but crimes that constitute their perpetrAtors what pirates are, what cannibals in the Fejee Islands are (cheers), enemies of the human race (cheers), and meriting, not from one nation, not from one people, but from the whole of the human race summary and peremptory extirpation. (Loud cheers.) This,asitappearsto me,isnot thelangaage of anyparticular Individual or any particular country, bat the language of humnan nature ; and although I am unable to say how far such langaage may be ooncurred in by the great body of my fellow-citizens on the opposite side of the Atlantic, yet I think I know them well enough to say that no language can be too strong, no words too impressive, no force too sudden, no blows too severe for crimies such as those which have been perpetrated in India. (Cheers.) The LORD MAYOPR next gave, " Her Majesty's Ministers," and the toast was drunk with great cordiality. Earl GRANVIIL1 on rising to acknowledge the toast was received with cheers. He said-My Lord Mayor, ladies, and gentlemen, I beg to thank you for the honour you have done to the assembly of which I am an unworthy member. I believe it is not necessary to dwell upon the advantages of such an assembly in a mixed Government like our own; but I do feel that its popularity must depend verymateriallyupor, the manner in which its individual members discharge their duties. On this occasion I think it must be obvious that one member of that assembly has set a bright example of readinessto fulfil those duties which, as an Englishman, he owed to the State. You bave all heard the feeling terms in which the Duke of Cambridge expressed his devotion to that army in which he has been brought up, and to which he is so much attached. I feel it would be presumptuous on my part, in the presence of so many of his heroic comrades in arms, and after the significant homage that has been offered to him to-day in the city of London, to dwell upon his services in the field; but I hope he will excuse me if I refer, in contrast to the calmness with which he spoke to-night, to the agony of mind in which his Royal Highness was when he entertained a doubt whether an appointment would be given him in the Crimea which would enable him to risk his life iD the cause of his sovereign and of his country. The American hinister referzed in eloquent terms to the manner in which a prince might engage in public duties, and you all know that immediately after peace was restored the Duke of Cambridge undertook the drudgery of a very laborious office. (Hear, hear.) It is hardly possible, in referring to the duties discharged by members of the House of Lords, not t be struck by the responsibility which weighs at this moment upon some noble lords who are many miles distant from our shores. Among others I would men. tion Lord Elgin. He was sent on aimpotant mision to the East. His instructions were precise. The means placed a' his disposal for attaining the object of his mission, if he failed to do so peaceably, were amply sufaicient for the purpose. On his arrival in the East he found that a case had arisen which had been entirely unforeseen when he received his instructions. A most fervent appeal was made to him by the Governor-General of India to denude himself of those means which were most likely to insure his own success, in order to enable the Governor-General to put down a mutiny that had broken out in India. Not only did this request prevent Lord Elgin from carrying out his instructions, bat it also deprived him of any immediate chance of that personal distinction which he had a right to expect to obtain very easily and rapidly. He, however, did not hesitate one moment. In the most cheerful manner he anticipated the wishes and instructions which were forwarded by the Government when they became acquainted with the events in India, and he put the whole of his avaUable force at the disposal of Lord Canning. Lord Elgin has by this conduct deserved-and I venture to say he has obtained-the approbation of his countrymen. (Cheers.) There is another noble lord in the East upon whom has rested a heavier responsibility than has ever been sustained by any subject of Her present Majesty. Lord Canning did not, as has sometimes been said, solicit office. but when, after careful deliberation on the part of the Government, the office of Governor-General of India had been offered to him, and wben, after very mature reflection on his part he had accepted that office, he prooeeded to India, and devoted his admirable habits of business to the promotion of every possible material and social improvement in the great peninsula committed to his charge. A dreadful event nappened-one which, as the noble duke has observed, no one could have antidpated. As soon as that event was known in England the attention of Englishmen was, I may say, entirely absorbed by the proceedings in India, and from that moment to the present every step taken by the Governor-General was most anxiously criticized. Sometimes, I must say, his conduct was very fairly weiRhed, but at other times I think he has been assailed with such wholesale censure and condemnation as it was almost impossible for any one to have deserved. (Hear, hear.) Now, I beg that I may not be misunderstood. I think that no greater misfortune could happen to this nation tban that the public acts of public men should not be exposed to the most anxious and severe criticism, and I believe that those who criticize such acts with ability and fairness render the greatest possible service to the community. At the same time there is one shortcompound wordwhichwillalwayshave its effect with the British public-I mean fair-play (cheers), for, although they like to have public affairs discussed before them i every shape, they postpone their final judgment until they are in possession of all the facts and have heard both sides. (Cheers.) I feel that nothing would be more improper on an occasion like this than to enter into an argument or discussion upon points which must be reserved for a very different tribunaL I feel, too, 5that, as connected with the Government, It would not be right for me to anticipate the views of that Government, which must be officially declared upon every point of Lord Canning's conduct. I think, however, you will allow that It will not be altogether unbecoming on my part if I venture veryeshortly to endeavour to correct some misapprehensions as to certain facts, and to state other facts which may help both you and the public to form a just conclusion on some questions which have beenraised. A great many accusations have been brought against the Government of India. Some of them are of a very trlvial character; others depend so entirely upon details and circumstances of whloh we know absolutely nothing that I will not allude to them. But there is one charge which has been urged against Lord Canning, and which appears to me one of the gravest charges that could be made against a man in his position-namely, that, giving way to a certain sentimental and maudlin humanity, he has forgotten what was due to justice, and has interfered with those military authorities in whose hands the punishment of the mutineers must mainly rest. Now, upon this point the common sense of the public has fally spoken out. Both public writers and public speakers have done so, and no one, I may say, has laid down more forcibly than the Duke of Cambridge the doctrine that it would be wrong in every point of view if condigp punishment were not inflicted upon men who have disgraced the human form which they bear. I cannot help remarking that upon this subject public opinion has been ratified by a gentleman who is not one of ourselves, and who cannot be supposed to be actuated by excited feelings-I mean the most respected hiinister of the IJnited States-who, as a disinterested observer, has justly said that men who have committed crimes which prove them to be the enemies of mankind at large ought to be extirpated from the face of the earth (Cheers.) I can only say that, if upon a calm review of the course of Lord Canning's administration, he should appear to have given way to the maudlin sentiments to which I have alluded, no feeling of personal friendship would be sufficient to prevent me from expressing, at the earliest opportunity and in the most public manner, my opinion that he is unworthy of the trust L^hich has been confided to him. I must say, however, I do not fear that my friendship will be put to any such test as that. I can see nothing in the acts of Lord Canning to justify the charges which have been brought against him. I shall refer to one case. The late aad much lamented Mr. Colvin, after showing great energy and admirable judgment in his administration, issued a proclamation offering full pardon to those rebels who should submit at once. Lord Canning immediately reprimanded Mr. Colvin for this proclamation, and directed by telegraph that it should be suppressed, at the same time issuing another of an entirely different tenor. In more than one letter privately addressed to me by Lord Canning he has dwelt upon the "soreness of heart"-those are his very wordi-erceited by the feeling that retribution has been delayed upon "devils in human form." Mach stress has been laid, upon a prodanmation, or rather order which. has been lately issued. Now, I shall. give no opsusonor my own as to that proc!nmation, as to whether - was judicious in its substance, or as to the time at which it was issued; but I ihall venture to.state a few undeniable facts respectingit. The tendency oi that direction or proel3a mation was that death should h4 inflicted upon all the guilty, although in some cases whore there were ex-tenuating circumstances th& altimate penalty should not be at once iLificted; but the strictest injunotions were given to spare none except the rsally innocent. That ordkr was addressed exclusively to thb civil author-ites. It did not give to them one iota. of more power than they had before, but merely gave them certain directions, us to the exercise of those powers which by law they already possessed. The only reference to, the military authorities was that in certain doubtful. casss the civil eSficers sbould not act themselves, but shound band over thei:aprisoners to the military anthorities to be doalt with by 'hem. I know it may be maid, that although this order was. addressed to the ecvil authorities it was calculated indireeday to produce a discouraging effect nmpon the military authorities. Upon this point I shall give no opinion, but I may refer to nev case that has comne to my knowledge. I belieusa there zrc no two nien in India who more fullv deserve the confidenco of the p sblo than Genaral Wilsen. aind S;r John Lawrence. It appears to m, that General Wilson, while sbowing the greatest boldness.aud energy in handling his troops and in maintaining their discipline, is alsomost cariful not to expose them unnecessarily. 1 believe, also, tbere is no doubt that Sir J. Lawroace combines the qualities of a soldier and a statesman ia greater degree than perhaps any other man in India. But what has been the effect of the proclamation upon theso two men ? It appears that General Wilson vroto to Sir J. Lawrence a few days before this proclamation was i-.sued, stating that there were certain Irregular Cavalry M hosa mode of mutiny had distinguished them from their ft llows and that it would be most expedient and politic that they should be tr-eated with some lenieocy. General Wilson acordingly asked Sir J. Lawrence w:bether he hires lf or whether Sir J. Lawrence woaid be justifiea ia exercising any discretion Sir J. lawrence answered I in the negative, and said I ould not livo ssi.y authoritj'; that he did not. 'fiSI,t C;c-nqal Wiifi could exercise any discretion- but that if General Wilson would make a representation at head'qoarters it would probably be attended to. Altmot immediately after the despatch or the letter containing this atatement sir J. Lawrence received the proclamation. He then wrot,9 to General Wilson, and said, " Although the procfamatioa does not specifielly apply to this case, yet it apiti-fully justifes you in following out the dictates of sound policy." And Sir J, Lawrence then went on in the moBt clear And eloquent terms to show, not merely the humanity, but the sound practical poacy of the proclamation. I do not give my own opinion on the sabject, although I have formed one ; but I do think that the opinions of two such men as these are worthy of consideration by the public of this country before they come to the conclusion that Lord Canning is a pusillanimous statesman There is another poinit which has been very much canvassed in this country, namely, the sending up of Ar. Grant to control the military authorities and to liberate the mutineers. It is reported that Mr. Grant has liberated 150 mutineers. I have no means of knowing whether that story is true or false, or whether if that act took place there were any circumstances which would justify the Governor-General in sanctioning or in disapproving it. But this I know as a positive fact, that the Governor-General sent Mr. Grant not to control the military authorities or to liberate mnutineers or murderers, but as the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces was confined In the fort of Agra, and unable to discharge his civil duties it was deemed desirable that a locum fuzens should be provided, and on that account Mr. Grant was despatched to the district, One of the quali. fications which Lord Canning believed that Mr. Grant possessed was, that he was fully impressed with the importanoe of not interfering with the military authorities in the performance of his duties. Thero is one other point which has hardly created as much feeling here as in Scotland -I mean tthe alleged differences between Sir Colin Campbell and Lord Canning. I was rejoiced to hear that his Royal Highness has reoeived exactly the same information which has reached me, and that the natural and just indignation of the people of Scotland at their favotrite soldier being thwarted by aceiviian, anad what they call a red-tapist, is unfounded. Lhappenxtolmo,v that dunng the few weeks of Sir Cohn Campbels residence in Calcutta Lord Canning had abundant opportunities of discovering and aDDreCating his great qualities as a man and a soldier, arnd T1kow also that Sir Corm Campbell during the same period saw reason to admire the indefatigable industry energy, and courag f rd Canning as Governor-General of India and that a solid friendship has been established between these two men, who entertein feelings of mutual respect and regard. I cannot help mentioning a somewhat trivi circumstance, but one which shows how cautious we should be in believing rumours that occasionally reach us from India. Sir Patrick Grant when leaving Calcutta, knowing well the tendenoy to idle gossip which prevailed among some of his fellow-countrymen in that city, particularly when they were excited by any extraordinary alarm, determined that, although it would have been more convenient to him to travel by the publio steamer, he would make the voyage in a man-of-war. He went by a man-of-war; but the cautious tacticsof the old soldier were utterly fraitless, for soonafterwards there appeared in a portion of the Calcutta pressa detailed account of his excursion in the public steamer, together with a minute report of his conversations with his fellow-passenge;s, ending with the remark attributed to him, that he never heard a sound so agreeable as the booming of the guns which announeced his departure from the land of red tape. Withregard to the charge of the want of energy, industry, and decision brought against Lord Canning, I shall only allude to one or two facts. You are aware that Lord Canning put restrictions upon the press. This is another subject upon which I must avoid expressing any oninlon, bht I think I may say that that resolution of Lord Canning apDeared to meet with general approbation, and was very fairly treated by the public press of this country, notwithstanding the eup-it de corps which to a certain degree might be expected to influence that press on such a subject. Whether right or wrong, it was a step which required great moral courage, and by its adoption Lord Canning exposed himself to much personal unpopularity and obloquy. We are bound to consider that some of the most intelligent men now inIndia-some of the men most accustomed to wield the pen, and who have the greatest opportunities of conveying their sentiments and opmions to the mother country-are smarting under the very natural feeling that they have been unjustly treated both as regards their character and their property. I think, therefore, that some of their statements should be received with due allowance. There is one more fact which I shall ventare to bring before you. I think it is one which has not yet been stated, and which aU will be glad to hear. It is generally Inown that the Xing of Delhi made overtures to the besiegixg army. Now, it happens that some of the bravest and most suc3essful milltary authorities in that part of India were of opinion that so great were the difficulties of the siege those overtures should be entertained. It is easy to say after the event vhat was the right thing to be done, but I sbmit that at the moment it was creditable to the decision and the moral courage of Lord Canning that he sent the most peremptory orders to reject the overtures made by the King of Delhi. I have done with this subject. I think success is not always a test of real merit, but in this instance Lord Canning has coUected more troops than It was expected he would be able to assemble, or than it was thought possible by the highest authority in Parliament he would be able to obtain, and without physical assistance from the home Government he has " brokenthe neck" of one of the most formidable mutinies which have ever occurred in our dominions. I cannot avoid saying one word as to Lord Elphinstone. The peerage of Scotland may be proud that one of their body has displayed such admirable qualities in India. I have made these remarks with reference to the conduct of members of the Eouse of Peers, bat it is impossible to overstate the heroic exertions of all classes of the community, whether in the civil or the military service, during this mutiny, or to overrate the spirit with which the people of this country have met the difficulties of the crisis (Cheers.) (The noble earl concluded by again returning thanks for the cordial manner in which the toast had been received,) The next toast propos by the LoRD MsxoiR was " The House of Lords ;" ackowledged by Lord CR,A.-vORTn Several other toasts foUowed, and the proceedings termi. ated at a late hour.

I sball feel obliged if you wvd allow me to correct an omission In the printed paper addressed by me to the members of the Senate. The net income of the vioars is given Dn an average of live years. The clause " on an average of five years" was unintentionally omitted by myself,-not much to be wondered at, seeing that at a little before 11 o'clock on Monday the paper alluded to was not written, but had to be written, printed, and circulated. by 2 o'clock the same day,-too short a time for consideration or correction. I am, Sir. vour obedient Rerv-nt JOHN BIRAMflAT;T Vjcar of Terrington St. John. St. Jobs Vicarage, Nov. 3.

WHrO SPBN?LW THE Mro1yc7 (From the New York Tima,n) The women of America have of late beeu paying the penalty of their podtion. From the extreme of obsequioue gallantry in regard to them we are passing to th e opposite excem of Tituperative injustice. We are treating them,in. fact, very much as thse African savage treats his Fet. 'sh. In the tiums of our prsperity We could not sufficiently t idulaI these lovely and omnipotent beings. We could refuse them nothing. The best seats at hotel tables, the only a ts in railway cam, the decencies of the steamboat deck, and the decorum of the stean7boat sapper were alike reserved !or them. We eacted of our police only one duty, to esco 't our ,wives and daughters daintily through the perils of th,' streets; and we expected ef all men only one virtae that of an almost servile sourtesy to the ladies. But adversity has Overtaken us, and all is changed. The pretty creatures of yesterday are the '*extravagant syrens" of to-day. Miss Flora M'Flmsey is the type otherthoughtless and treacherous sex, and the pitcous- cry of £ennthing to pay," which comes up from all the deoeorate debtors of the lnd, we declare to he but the echo of the iniquitots female complaint of " nothing to wear." The argument of this altera. tion in the tone of the men is not anew one. It is 1, old, indeed, as the troubles of " gardener Adam znd his 'wife." The maun has got himself into a scrape, and the woman mnst be his excuse. She was born to be his Jr helpmeet," and if she can't save him from the consenuence of bis folly, at least be may throw on her shoulders the blame. Whose fault it is, by the way, that those lovely shoulders so often need something thrown en them, he does not, in his flurry of selfsh concern, particularly pause to, inquire. There let the blame fall, d rest if it may. Now, we do not pretent to deny that certain classes of women in America have of late years been livbing to dress, to drive, and to-dance. We do not pretend to deny that an order of frivolous females has flowered oat of the soil of this Ne'v World, remarkable among thesimpletons of theearth for an exclusive developoient of all sorts Of extravagant faults. We do not pretend to deny that the vulgar aims and the vulgar ambitions of reckdess and money-seeking men have been fasrly matched among us by the equally vulgar aims and the equally vulgar ambitions of reckless and moneyspending women. Eut we do deny most empliatically that tne women of America, or that the women of Neow ork are as a body liable to the charge of recklessness and extravagance, or as a body responsible in any appreciable degree for the present calamities of the financial and the commercial world. This very city of Gotham, whereof the name is a synonym throughout the land for all manner of goreeons fo es, and costly absurdities, and expensive immorai.ties, teems at this moment with quiet, loving, sinsere, and honourable women, who regulate their own households and share with theirhusbandsthe anxietiesof his iniustrious career, and lighten by their counsel as well as by their sympathy the burdens of his perplexing affairs. Hundreds and thoneands of these women there are, and in everv rank of life, in the circles of fashion as well as in the noomes of mechanic toil, whom the trials of this critical seascn will find as the trials of prosperity have found them- " Nobly planned, to wara, to comfort, and comuand." As the skies darken, as the need of retrenchment makes itself more sharcly and more universaUy felt, as one luxury after another must be put down by the opulent, and one comfort after another sacrificed by the merely well-to-do, this truth will be nobly vindicated in a thoasandhouseholds. No man who knows the sex and their ways will doubt that the cashmere will be relinquished, to say the least, qulte as cheerfully as the " Morgan horse," and that Mrs. Smith will find it quite as easy to counter;and her soirfc as Mr. Smith to resign his membership at the club. The statistics of the past on this subject are eloquent enough to be of some use, perhaps, to those vho doubt about the fature, and who treimble afresh for Wall-street whenever they think of Fifth-avenue. It has become a commonplace of misogynist declamation, for instance, to aver that the "ex cessive importations of superfluous goods from foreign countries," to which a certain set of economists choose to trace our present disorders, have been provoked by the extravaganco of our women. Crinoline and moire, gloves and feathers, fans and furbolows, kickshaws and gewgaws, these have ruined us ! These have drained us of our western wheat and our Californianr gold, to give us in return only hatel flirtations and -watering-place polkas. Let us see how this matter stands. For the fiscal year 1855-6, the importations of silk goods into this country amounted to $25,200,65L Traly a " parlons" sum and a tremendously effective figure of speech for a " sermon on the times" or a lecture on the ladies ! But statistics are like puddings, the proof of their value is only to be got at by discussion, Out of these millions of dollars worth of silk therc are certain "masoulinities" to be deducted. We must abstract therefrom all the sleeve and shirt-linings of some 4,000,000 of male coats, all the cravats and waistcoats of silk that the American men from Maine to C_ifornia contrive in a twelvemonth to consume, remembering wlien we make the sum that the "black satin waistcoat" may almost be considered as a "national costume" in certain portiens of our beloved country, all the mystical ribbons and aprons of all the orders and lodges v hich swarm in the land, aU the flags and banners in which we Americans so extravagantly delight, together with such silken vanities in the way of cushions and curtains, &c., as are common to both sexes. Allowing less than $2,2O,000 for all these things, we have a totl of $23,000,000 spent by our women in silks. Is this extravagant ? At an average of two dollars per yard in price the quantity of silk thus represented would be 11,500,OO yards, equal,-as a reasonable young lady assures us, to 1,000,000 of ilk dresses made very moderately, Now, there were in the United States in 1850 just 3,363,427 houses occupied by free persons. Of these houses it is a low estimateto assume that 1,500,O0 were tenanted by families whose in. comes averaged $1,000 per annum. We have, therefore, the proof before us that, out of 1,500,000 households whose resources would certainly justify the expense, only twothirds can possibly have indulged themselves in the purchase of a single silk dress during the years 1856-7, Again, our importation of gloves in the same time amounted to $1,344,550. This comprises the value of gloves of all kinds and sizes, and if we limit the men and children to the $344,550, it gives us just a single million of dollas spentupon thedefence and ornament of the 8,000,000ofwhite hands upon which 6,OO,OOOof adultmalelipskeptconstantly swearing fealty for 12 long months. Thread laces are certainly in modern times a parely female gaud, though the legend stiU survives in this city of a gentleman whose nuptial garments were made beauteous with borders of point; and thread laces are costly. Yet in 1856-7 our account for this triviality rose only to S410,591, against a purely masculine expenditure of $576,435 for fanoy foreign fire-arms ! Much was said last year of the female eWpenditure in furs, but the remorseless tables of the Treasury set off against $605,607 of garment furs $1,755,704 imported by masouline hatters. The embroideries of the year constitute a serious item, rising to $4,604,353, but it is perhaps as well that no observations thereupon should be indulged by us, who spent at the sametime $4,754,592 in cigars and foreign smoking tobacco, and who must bear pretty largely the responsibility of disbursing over $7,500,000 for foreign wines and spirits. Our space forbids us from pushing these comparisons so far as they might with advantage be carried. It would be unprofitable, for example, to dwell upon the fact that the. total amount of our expenditure for foreign luxuries of all kinds during tha year 1855-6 does not reach the sum of $oO,000,000, while our national income from the rated property of the country, if calculated at 6 per cent., rose during the same period to $422,295,750. But the figures which we have given may at least suffine to satisfy the most captiousand the most querulous of the sons of Adam that when he rails ulpon the women as the cause of his troubles he is only "darkening counsel by words without krnowledge," an& contributing a new element of stupidity and misconception. to that confusion of ideas which 3s the most dangerous as. well as the most humiliatino feature of our present national crisis.
MSuKTrA Y lxSTRuCmION.-The annual report of Colonel C. Hay, the Commandant of the Schoolof Ausketry at Hythe, has just been made for the year ending the 31St of March last. It is a very elaborate documnent, and enters very circmstrantially into the results of the School at Hythe, and into the musketry practice in the army generaily. Colonel Hay remarks that another year's expenence affords fresh and convincing proof of the soundness of the system of musketry now^v authorized, as also of the organization established to insure its being efficiently and uniformly carried out. At Hythe 108. officers. (including 20 of the Hon. East India Company's service) have been exercised in every respect as the noncommissioned ofdicers and privates, and of this number 66, or 61-U per cent., became first-class shotr, 39 second elass, leaving only 3, or 2,, per cent., in the thirdclass. Of the 590 non-commissioned officers-and privates whose performances are recorded 329, or 55-29 per cent., passed into the first class in shooting, 256 into the second class, leaving only ll, or 1'86 per cent., in the third class. In the 595 are Included 121 non-commissioned officers who offered themselves as candidates for the Corps of Instructors of Musketry, of which number only 44 were found eligible for instructors The chief cause which led to the rejection of so large a number of rron-commissioned ofrrcers for the Corps of Instructors-viz., 77, was - defieiency in writing and arithmetic. The performances of the officers, non. commissioned officers, and privates in. the judging distance. practices have been good; 84 per cent. of officers passed lnto the first class, not leaving any in the third class - and of the non-commissinneA officers Lad private3 79 per cent. passed into the first clws, leaving only about 24 per cent. in the third clas.

FOREIGN XG VTBLLrGaEBB. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CO RPOD.) The following appeared in our second edition of yes. t~dav :-I ZAEUS, TuEsD.y, Nov. 3, 6 mir. A telegraphic message received in Paris to-day states that the Duke de Grammont, the newly-appointed French Ambassador to Rome, arrived on the 30th at Civita Vecchia. It Is said that M. de Bourqueney, French Ambassador at Vienna, will spend a good part of the winter In IParis. The Marquis de Bonneville, First Secretary of Embassy, will remain as Charge d'Affaires. Rumours having been in circulation that the Government had prevented any speeches being delivered over the grave of General Cavaignac, the Patric gives the following account of what took place on the occasion:- The Prefect of Police sent to the family of the General in order to arrange in concert with It the details of the ceremony, so that nothing should he done except in accordance with their wishes. It was asked what persons would deliver addresses at the grave, as it was desired to respect the wishes of the family and prevent strangers from coming forward and speaking without their authority- I The answer given by M. de Foissy, cousin of the General, was that nothing had been decided on the subject, but that if any speech were delivered, it would be by either M. Dufaure or M. SDenard. No objection was made to this arrangement. On the day of the funeral M. de Foissy informed the representatives of the Prefect that it bad been decided that no address should be delivered, and expressed his satisfaction that the family had been allowed every latitude for the funeral. Before the funeral was concluded Madame Pi3catory went to the Prefecture to thank the Prefect of Police, on the pars of Madame Cavalguac, for the consideration 'which had been shown her and her family." it is pretty certain that the Emperor is much annoyed at the turn things are taking in the Danubian Principalities; perhaps he now regrets having allowed his political agents to excite the population and the Divans to the pitchthey now are in. He is angry with Austria, angry with Turkey, angry with those about him, angry with Pvedschid Pasha, and very angry wvith the Ministerial press, which has made matters worse, and these who inspire it. It is remarked that neither the Austrian nor Turkish Ambassador has as yet been invited to take part in the festivities of Compiegne, though series after series of guests has gone there. Even if the two tabooedc dipiomatists were now invited it would hardly be considered a distinction, as the festivities are drawing to a close. Something serious must be going on at this moment at Constantinople, if it be true, as reported, that Md. de Thouvenel has suspended his relations with Redschid Pasha, though not with the Government. It is added that M. de Thouvenel has been left alone in this matter, and that the representatives of the other Pofers, even those who have sided with the French Ambassador on the question of the Principalities, have not imitated him, but continue their intercourse as usual with the Grand Vizier. The :;5tll of December is now spoken of for the Congress to receive the reports from the Commissions in the Principalities. A private letter from Madrid, of the 30th ult., states that on the following day the Gazette was to give what is usually termed the political programme of the Government. Every new Cabinet in Spain almost invariably puts forth a manifesto, in which the brightest hopes are held out to the nation, and the most glorious prospects predicted; and each Administration, of course, makes it clearly underst33 I that it alone, and none other, insures the salvation vf the country, and that it alone is the admiration and envy of Europe. The same course will be followed, no doubt, on the present occasion. My correspondent says: "This programme will comprlse three points :-L That of the political press. The present Ministry Intend, they say, to relax the restrictions of the exsting law, which, ir point of fact, is no law, but merely the project of one which the Cha-nbors authorized the Government of Narvaez to promulgate, without prejudice, however, to its Weing subsequently examined and discussed in the Cortes. The Piscal of the Press has recAlved orders from Bermudez de Castro to be more tolerant-and, so far, he is entitled to credit. Nocedal, of detestable memory, appolited as Fiscal or Controller of the Press an officer on the retired list, formerly of the Foreign Legion. The Administrator of the Post-office was in the habit of sending to this Fisoal's hov,ce copies of aU the newspapers and other periodicals the moment the French mail arTived. The French mail from Ir,n reaches Madrid at 9 o'clock at night, and that from ll'zondo (by Navarre) at 2 in the afternoon. The Fiscal spent 24 hours in examining them; he stopped those he thought proper, and the others were distributed in Madrid some 40 hours after they were received. Bermudez de Castro has suppressed the post of Fiscal, and the result is that for the last two daysforeign newspapers comeregularly. " The second point in the programme has reference to the political reform which the Narvaez Cabinets succeeded il iLtroducing int) the Senate and the constitution of the State. The present Government gives up the notion of its predecessor relative to reforndng the rules of the two Chambers by means of aspeciallaw, and to the introduction of other modifcations, which would have transformed the Spanish Parliaments into a mere legislative Body, after the fashion of the French Chambers. The Armero-Mon Cabinet intends enlarging the existing regulations as left by Narvaez ly meEns of organic laws in a more liberal sense, as it does not 'wish to suppress, by Royal decree, the vote of Parliament sanctioned by the Crown. " The third point of the programme relates to the ques. tion of persons, which, by the way, Is the most difficult of all. I am bound to say that the Government seems dis. pos2 I in this matter to employ men known for their liberal mnd (a' the same time) conservative opinions. " Having disposed of these three points, I now procsed to ot1:er matters which are not known to the public. The ma.ifesto of Queen Christina defending herself from the cl-arges, or rather the iisinuations, of the famous committee of tlhe Constituent Assembly, is already in print, though not puhllshed. Two copies only have been given away by the lli.rquis de Itemisa (the fortunate brother of the still more fortunate Duke de (lianzares), one to M. Mon, and the other to A. Bermndez de Castro. Maria Christira is to the King and his reactionary CamariUa what Banquo's ghost was to ilacbeth. I have already mentioned that the Government mean to bring back Maria Christina, who, to say the trath, is in no great hurry to enter Spain, while Iher husband is most anxious to do so. Many of the old monarchical Progresistas, such as Cortin, Collado, Gomez de D. Serna, Cantero, Luzuriaga, &c., are anxious that she shoald return to Spain, to prevent or retard a great catas. trophe which is likely to follow the two marked tendencies which are manifested here-namely, absolutism under Queen iaabel, and the fusion of the two branches of the Spanish Bourbons. A conblderable portion of the old Monteanolinists are on these two points completely agreed with the Absolutist-bloderados of the Queen's party, and who are represented in the press by the Ziegeneracion newspaper, the organ also of the most fanatical among the clergy. The manager of that organ is the son of a man who bad been for years Director-General of the Sale of National Property, and owes all he has to the measures which secularized it. Queen Christina Is the ckief obstacle in the 'way of reaction and of the fusion in question. The King, who kept up some time ago a regular and frequent correspondence with his cousin, the Count de Montemolin, is the life and soul of the plot. When Queen Christinia was last autumn in Rome, at the time that MI. Mon arrived there as Ambassador. the Cardinals, who ao favourable to Montemolinism and the Court of Naples, tijed to sound MariaChristina on the question of theofusion, She rejected all their advances with something like indigna. tion, and she exerted herself so much that she got into her possession certain autographs written by her ephewthe baslg uonsors oti Spain to Count do Monternolin, in a sense decidedly favourable to the fusion. These letters were for. 'warded by ssre hands to her daughter, Queen Isabella, 'who keeps them very carefuUy in case it may be necessary some day to make use of them. The Queen detests from her heart the Carlists, aud "or that reason the Liberal party is begin. ning to repose more confidence than previonsly in the liberal sentimnents of the mother of Queen Isabella. " The complete solitude in which General Narvaez is left is most singular. His case must be nearly hopeless, for nearly the whole of his llatterers abandon him. He feels keenly this treatment, and for the last four or five days he has been making every effort to return to power before the Queen's accouchenlent whlch is expected in about three weeks. is few remaining friends are promising the Palace favourites everything they shall desire in return for the help they give them to return to place. I doubt whether those efforts will be crowned with success. The Queen hates Xarvaez, if, indeed, she has not forgotten his very existence. He himself is aware that the number of his enemies is great, and among them it appears he regards the French Ambassador, M. Turgot, whom he believes to possess much influence with the Queen. No one is Ignorant of the hostility existing between M. Turgot and Narvaez, apd what trouble Madame Montijo has taken to try to get M, Twrgot recalled by the Emperor, The Emperor has hi therto resisted all the influence of his mother-in-law and her devoted frlends in the Governnent. " O'Donnell and Ros de Olnao are on a very good footing with Turgot. The former, as you may supposo, chuckles over the fall of his rival Narvaez. Tho Milesian, however, has no great influenco in the Palace. The Queen keeps tho Vicalvarists at a distance; she dislikes them; and I have already mentioned to you the epithet of the 'Peninsular Sepoys' which she has gtven themalluding to the military revolt of 1854. O'Donnell is not to be despised, for all this: he has a strong party in the army, which owes to him its presentorganization. If Gene. ral Pezuela had entered the Government drming the late crisis he would unquestionably have brought to court. martial the military revolters of the Campo de Guardias of June, 1854. Pezuela is a man of very deolded character, though a poet, aud nothing would gratify him more than to give a lesson to the leaders of those organized bands de. nominated the Spanish army. It is true that Pezuela himself was a revolter in 1843, but that was against a Progresista Government, and is neither here nor there."

AUSTRIA. (FROM oun OWN OOwRPBPOXD2NT. I VIENNA, Nov. 1. The public is aware that the heavy stamp duty which has just been imposed on the periodical prews Will be fatal to the papers that are not subsidized by Government, and it is astonished that the man who not long ago abolished the so-called " prohibitive duties'- in Austria should now lay such an onerous tax on intellectual produce. As has been said, the sense of Paragraph 6 of the Imperial Ordinance is not clear, but the Ost-Deutsche Post is of opinion that a postage stamp must, as heretofore, be affixed to every copy of a paper that is sent by post to a subscriber. A duty of 15 kreutzers (6d. English) must in future be paid on each advertisement, instead of 10 kreutzers, as ihas hitherto been the case. The leadiug papers, which cost 12ff. a-year, wil have to pay 5fl. 12k. stamp-duty, a,nd the second and third rate organs of the press have to pay the same sum, although they only cost 6fl. and Sfl. Men in office say that the blow was aimed at the cheap papers, but the circulation of the higher-priced papers is not likely to be half as large as it is at present. In 1856 the Ost-Deutsche Post, Oesterreichische Zeitung, and Wanderer, which are the leadlng Vienna papers, were thriving, but during the present year the two papers last mentioned have not been able to make both ends meet. At the beginning of 1857 there was little foreign intelligence of importpnce, and as the Austrian pay ors were notand are not-permitted to meddle with international matters, they lostQ a great part of their subsctibers. Subjoined you have extracts from the leading articles of two of the Vienna papers on the subject in question. The Pre.sse says*. "The faU of Delhi and the introduction o? a newspaper stamp into Austria are the two events of the week, and both of them deserve the attention of the monoy-market. The former is the beginning of the end of the Indian mutiny; the latter is the first of those financial measures by means of which the equilibrium between the revenue and the expenditure is to be restored. The Vienna Exchamge rejoiced at the prospect of the deficit being done away with, and, consequently, the National Loan rose 1-16 per cent. " From 1816 until the end of 1855 the hasut volde of the financial world borrowed money from the Bankat4per cent. and lent it again to others at a much higher rate. Idillions and millions of florins were earned in this way, and the expenditure of the financiers was greater than that of the richest nobles. Since the beginning of last year the public presshas exercised a kind of control over financial operations, and, consequently, the persons who have reason to dislike pubHlc criticism should have displayed more enthusiasm on learning that the price of the Vienna papers will, on an average, soon be almost twice as high as it is at present." The Oesterreichische Zeitusng has the following "The Austrian press can now boast of having to contend with greater difficulties than any other in Europe. There is a stamp-duty in many other countries, but it is no' so grdat in proportiou to the price of the paper. It is probable that some of the non-official political journals wilU not outlive the 1st of January next, but we senture to assert that no finaucial measure wil be able to bring the A-astrian press to a complete standstill. Newspapers have become a necessity to the educated classes, aud consequently they wil not cease to read them when they become more expensive. The official papers are to be batter conducted than they are at present, and are to contain more real news; bat the public has a partiality for the independent organs of the press, and will assuredly give them its support. Wherever thinking beings reside the sound of a free and impJrtial word is welcome, for it Is almost as refreshing as the open air to man." The Ost-Deutsche Post also has a long article on the stamp duty, but it contains nothing of importance, excepting a hint that nothing could be more pernicious to Austria " than to cast the mantle of mystery over the state of her finances, and to endeavour to prohibit the free discussion of matters connected with national economy." The foregoing is a hit at Baron Bruck, who was always impatient of control, and has recently become morbidly sensitive to criticism or censure. Indeed, the public is of opinion that no stamp duty would have been imposed on the press if some of its organs had not given grea. offence to the Minister of Finance bv speaking unfavourably of some of his plans. go one has more openly complained of Baron Bruck's want of caution in railway matters than myself, but it iEs an undeniable fact that he rendered a service of the very highest importance to the country when he insisted on the Bank taking the necessary meesures for restoring the value of its notes. If the depreciation of the paper currency had been as great when the present monetary and comuaercial crisis conmenced as it was two years ago the chances are that one-half of the houses in Vienna would have been bankrupt, and the State with them. English firms are likely to lose money both by M. Bearzi and by the Eggendorf cottonspinning factory. A wholesale London grocer has a claim on the estate of the former to the amouut of 6,5001., and he may think himself fortunate if he gets paid 60 or 70 per cent. RUSSIA. (ROM OUR BERIN CORPPO?DNr..) BERLIN, Nov. 2. The last striking innovation that has been made on Russian prejudices and reigious feeiings by the reforming spirit of the present Emperor is the toleration acoorded by him to Freemasonry in Russia. The society of Freemasons has hitherto been strictly prohibited from const:tuting itself on the soil of Holy Russia; the employ6s of the State were always required to bind themselves never to belong to it; and the Greek Church has laid an anathema upon it. For more than half ayeer, however, " lodges" have been forming in the interior of the empire, and entering into correspondence with other " lodges" in foreign countries, and there are indications of different kinds that this phenomenon in the Russiam State is far from unwelcome to the powers that be. Two rezults are, as It would seem, expected from the benevolent working of this society-viz.,a better spirit on the part of the various Government functdonaries, and aF greater willingness to co-operate in the gigantic task the Government has entered upon of ommuting serfdom into a free relation of landoner and tenant. I beleve I ishall not be far wrong in imputing this change of tactics to the "Society of the Free and Accepted Masons" on the part of the Frnperor Alexander, to the influence of his uncle, the Prince o' Prussia, who has for many years belonged to it, and, in spite of the disinclination of the King his brother towar ds it, has persiAted in having his son, Prince Frederick Wilalam also introduced into it. Some fewyears backthis formed the subject of a very acrimonious conflict between the two brothers, the whole body of the Lutheran High Church party siding with the King in reprobating the existence of the society; and about that time it transpired that the then Grand Dake Alexander had requested informiation on the subject from the Prince of Prussia, and received from him a very able and somewhat lengthy paper on the subject. At the beginning of this year the King of Hanover entered the society, and, after passing rapidly through sll the grades, was admitted a member of all the lodges in his dominions, and was finally made Grand Master in Hanover. He had already, in 1852, constituted himself the protector of the society, but it was not till January of this year that lie entered the body itself, and attained the same rank that his father, the late King Ernest Augustus had occupied in it previously. Up to that time Frederick the Great was the only reignaing monarch who had entered the society; but since the entrance of the King of Hanover the reigning Duke of Saxe Gotha has also enteredi It, and been made a member of the Lodge " Ernst zum Compass." The King of Hanover coupled one condition with his own entrance-viz.,that at the next approaching revision of the statutes the principle of exclusive Christianity which pervades the Prussian lodges should be also introduced into Hlanover. It would, perhaps, be difficult to find any form of organization so capable of pervading the iramense Russian empire and so admirably adapted to Russian society as this one, which, if favoured by him, would so effectually protect the Emperor against secret conspiracies or so willingly further his plans for the general good. The Itvalide is kind enoughto favour us at length with its own explanation of the leading motive which impelled the Emperor to the two Imperial meetings at Stuttgart and Weimar:- "'Universal peace-that was the object of the Emperor Ale-cander IL's journey. People who want to unriddle the rencontre in Stuttgart will find the answer in the meeting at Weimar. At both places the object was not the fornia tion of new alliances, but the attainment of persona approximation. alliances are generally formed for some special definite object. The great mistake of the Holy AiJance was, that it was not based on any positive idca This alliance, in spite of its magniloquent programme, de elared no war against Belgium when it separated itselt from HoDand; it entered onino conflict with the Revolution of July, and still less with that of February. The late meeting of the Emperor of Russia with the Ewperor of the French shows, moss convincingly, that the Holy Allince, which had taken upon itself by foregone conclusions to pre scribe a path to history, was a mere airy fabric of the brain. devoid of all practical applicability. The Holy Alliance has bequeathed to the after-world the corviction that monarchs and nations by no means stand in need of the creation of special obligations to be able to live quietly and peaceably together, and strive together for the development of civilization. It is not till rome one State or other, led astrayby paselon or by some faho combination, seems about to enripach on the rights or the existence of other Powers, that aimore intimate union among other States, which find their advantage in combining their efforts to avert the danger, shows itself to be a necessity. And when this proximate object is attained this special league blends into that general alLiance which is so a solutely necessary for the interests and the development of odvilization in all the nations of Europe." The 2fiort7wm Bee is again in an amiable mood, and assures us as positively as possible that there is no inclination on the part of other great Powers to take advantage of Enpland's present: position, and settle the iimporf-nt4 questions of the moment, either in a senes opposed to hers, or without her co-operation. Europe stands in need of repose and peace (that is to say, Europe in general, and Russia in particular), and the different States are now bound so closely together by gold and silver cords that England's misfortunes cannot fail to exert an adverse influence on the others. The two other journals, the Intalide and the Journal of the Academy, paint olr position in the darkest colours, and, little as the above expressions of the Bee's sympathy 'were free from selfinterestedness, the Isvealide and the Journal of the Academy do not even indulge in them. The Norhern Bee is somewhat ahead of its fellows in the Russian prers, and has already arrived at the only just conviction, that England's difficulties in India are a gain to nobody, and least of all to Russia, for she is at the present moment less able than any other Power to derive any advautage from the "liberation of India from the English yoke." Russia requires all the energies, men, and money she can spare just now to work out her task in the Caucaeus, the neighbourhood of the Caspian Sea, and her enormous territory to the east of the Lake of Baikal, and this task is rendered more difficalt than ever by the present excited state of the Mussulman population on the Russian frontiers and by the present inflated temper of the Chinese. It is, therefore, evidence of good sense on the part of the Northlern Bee to refrain from injuring the present harmony in Europe on the supposition that our difflculties in Asia are likely to last for ever. A certain Professor Barchen, in a recent number of the Busk7i Vestnik- (Russlan Messenger), called zealously for the introduction of trial by jury; and the Moslauer Zeitzntig subsequently devoted several articles to showing the advantages this system, coupled as it would necessarily be with the publicity of trials, would confer upon Russia. Since then the subiect has come to be treated freely by most of the journals; but while this freedom of discussion has brought to full light the very great desirableness and want of radical'reforms in the administration of justice in Russia, it has at the same time shown very convincingly that several generations must pass away, and be succeeded by others with new and successively further developed capacities, before such reforms can be careied into execution. There are 600 courts of law throughout the country, and considerably more than 1,000 counsel or jurists capable of pleading in public would have to be educated to their new functions, the judicial bench would have to be supplied -with a fresh order of men, and a new code of laws introduced, which should have at least some little title to the respect of a logical and educated mind. The sole value of the prezent code is, that it is something definite, and may be appealed to as a refuge from the ignorance, venality, and arbitrary exercise of power so often exhibited by the judges there; beyond that it has none. What diffliculties the Government has at present to contend with from tQe total absence of educated jurists may be seen from the following:-A Russian General in Warsaw bears in conversation one evening that he has been nom;nated Chief Judge in the Polish capital; he calls upon the Stadtholder the next morning, and, after finding that the report was perfectly correct, he re. monstrates with his Excellency on the nomination, and gives him every proof that he knows nothing at all of law, and does not even understand the most ordinary legal expressions. IHis Excellency reasons with him a long time in the hope of persuading hin to accept the office, and gives up his attempt at last with the remark-" WVe1, I shall find some other General who wil; but I should have preferred you, because I know that at least you are possessed of common sense and honesty."
LORCD BROUGHAM AXD H[IS EDIUCATION IN EDINnmRGIT.-At the dinner recently given to Lord Broughami a, Penrith, and in reply to one of the toasts, his Lordshlo skid "I look on myedeationfn Edinburgh as having been a very great benefit conferred on me by Providence." At the opening af the University of Edinburgh on Mondayv th.e very Rev. Principal Lee, in his introdtuctory address, took notice of this remark, and gave a short account of the shoolboy history of Lord Brougham. "Though descended." he said, "from an ancient English fAmily he was born isa Edinburgh, and his mother was a niece of lrlnclpaj Roberson.

THE MURDER I.N ESSEX. Little additional clne has been obtained to this mys. terions affair, notwithstanding the diligencs and activity of the constabrlary force. The police have published the following more correct description of the supposed murderers --"A tall, powerful, rough-lookiDng fellow, about 30 years of age, 5 feet 10 in height, deeply marked with the smallpox, short thick sandy whiskers, supposed to be dressed in a frqtian short jacket, with trousers of the 3ame material, and black 'I de-a-wake.'" The other man was about 27 years of age, or a little older, 5 feet 5 inches in height, without whiskers, has a sore on his left cheek as iE he had had a recent blow, rings in his ears, and was dressed in a blue Guernsey jacket, cord trousers, and cap. It is stated that two men exactly answvering this description caUed at a beershop a' Earl's Colne, a short distance from the scene of the murder, abont an hour before the robbery, and were afterwards observed to follcw Mr. Butcher in the direction of his residence. Previously to leaving Colchester the deceased purchased the articles of groceiy which were found near the body, and it is believed has last purchase was made at a butcher's shop in Crouchstreet, where he bought a small piece of beef for gravy, as he intended to have a hare for dinner the next day. He was then observed to have several sovereigns, besides change out of a half.sovereign with which he paid for the meat. In the course of Monday the Colchester police took into custody a man who answered the general description of one of the alleged murderers, but upon being confronted with the witncsses the identity failed, and he was therefore liberated. A post mortema examnination of the body was made yosterday (Tuesday) by Messrs. John Taylor, of Earl's Colne, and Mr. Rodick, of Halsted, the resnlt of which was, as stated in the e- idence at the inquest, that both gentlemen arrived at the conclusion that death was caused by suffocation, and not by any natural cause. In their opinion peculiar violence haLd been used, which maybe explained in the one wordgarotting. The inquest was held yesterday (Tuesday) at the Five Bells, Colne-Engaine, before Mr. Codd, the county coroner, and a very respectable jury, Mr. J. J. Mayhew, of Overhall, aoting as foreman. After a view of the body the following evidence was adduced :- Henry Hubbard, a labourer at White Colne, deposed to meeting with the deceased about five or ten minutes past 6 about 30 rods from the scene of the murder. Close behind him followed a strange man, walking at the same brisk pace -about four miles an hour. Two rods further on he met a third person, also a stranger. Their appearauce coincided with the description given above. fr. Thomas Taylor, farmer, Earl's Colne, deposed to walking with the deceased to within a quarter of a anile of the fatal spot. He was then in good spicits and perfectly sober. It was moonlight, and at the pace the deceased was walking five minutes would take him to the spot. He obssrved no persons following. Thomas Butler, an ander-gardener in the employ of Mr. Robert Hills, Colne-park, was returning from work about 6 o'clock in the evening in question, and when 50 or 60 yards from the spot heard what appeared to him to be a scraping or scufflmg noise on the road, apparently of twa or three persons, and an exclamation of " Oh, dear " os ' Oh, don't !" followed by a noise similar to that whicb would proceed from a person choked. Quickening his pace somewhat, witness passed through the park gates, which he olosedharshly after himand thenprooeeded towards the noise. After walking a few yards witness ILstened a moment, and distinctly heard the footsteps of persons running off. Suspecting something was wrong, he ran to the next turn. Ing, and found a hat lying on the side of the road nearest the park; near the hat was a parcel; and a yard or two off on the contrary side of the hedge, l,id the body of a man whom witness immediately recognized as the deceased, Isaac Butcher. He was lying on his back, with his head turned towards Earl's Colne; his waistcoat was entirely unbuttoned, and the flap an(d waist. band of the breeches were also unbuttoned, but not fally opened. The hoots were pushed down, so that witness could see two or three inches of stocking. Witness noticed that at that moment the deceased's hands, which were lying on his thighs, fell by his side, and his mouth feU open, as if all strength was jast gone. Beyond this he was motionless, and appeared to be dead. He then went on to the next corner, and again heard footsteps of persons ranning along the road. He then turned back, and, re-passinu the body, went for assistance. On returning he found Mr. Maybew*and a brother of the deceased by the corpse. E&rly the next morning (Sunday) he observed a pool of blood, the size of the crown of a man's hat, exactly in the Position where the deceased's feet had lain, and where the head had rested two smaller clots. There was not, however, much appearance of a struggle. Mr. Mayhew, jun., stated that he was driving Ur.Thomas Batcher by Mr. Hills's park, and when he arrived at the spot mentioned his horse suddenly stopped, and witness then observed something lying by the side of the road, which, on getting out, he discovered to be the body of a man quite dead. His clothes were in the ruffled state described by the last witness, and his face was bloody and quite dark, so that he could not recognize him. Deceased's brother then alighted, and, lifting hnm up, at once recognized him. Mr. Thomas Butcher, of Colne-Engaine, dealer, corroborated the statements of the last wltness; he was with his brother on Saturday at Colchester market, which was the last occasion on which he saw him alive. On lifting up the body witness exclaimed, " It's Isaac, he@s robbed and murdered," and felt his poekets outside, but could feel no money in them. In his breast coat pocket was a pocket-book and check-book, the former of which contained a receipt for 635lM, which deceased had paid into the bank the previous day. Mr. Francis Butcher, another brother of the deceased, was at his late residence when the corpse was brought home on Saturilay evening, and examined his clothes; those produced were the same. The wearing apparel produced wAs in some parts saturated with human blood, and the important fact was noted that blood was smeared both inside and outside the right breeches pocket, as if a hand covered with blood had been thrust in. The buttons on the waistcoat were torn off as if torn open with great haste and vicolance. Police-constable Watts. of the Essex constabularly, who produced the clothes, denosed to finding some of the mssing buttons on the spot the next day. MLr. John Taylor, surgeon, of Earl's Colne, deposd,-On arriving at the spot indicated by the witnesses I found the body of the deceased reclining on the bank, in which posi. tion it had been placed previously to my arrival. It was warm, but the extremities cold. The nose, which was much swollen, was severely contused, which was probably the result of a fall. The face was a mass of blood, and the puer lip had a cut inside corresponding with the tooth. Pe was then conveyed home, where I made a further examination. After being washed the face presented several dark and swollen places. After describing the clothes as smeared with blood, the witness stated,-I found marks in the right-hand pocket of the breeches as if a bloody hand had been introduced into it. Both ools of blood mentioned by the witnesses must have come erom the nose. On Monday, assisted by Mr. Rodick, of Halsted, I made a further external examination of the body. On the head there was no appearance of external injury. The fa^e was very turgld, but not distorted; the nose swollen, with blood oozing from it, but no injury to the bony structure - mucous membrane black and turgid. Inside the upper lip a small lacerated wound, corresponding with the mcddle incisor tooth of the left side; a smaU portion of sand between the teeth, the tongue not protruding or swollen. On the throat, upon the angle of each jaw, a small ecchymosed spot, largest on the lefe side, and rather oval shaped. Immediately below the jaw several superficial and very elight abrasions, probably the result of au injury before death. The arms presented ecchymnosed patches on both sides just above the elbows, the larget in size on the left arm, Theahands were extended. There was a wound over the left elbow and contusion on the back of the left hand, AU thbse spots and wounds were caused without doubt dnring lies. To-day, assisted by Mr. Rodick, an internal exanination of the body was made. The head was opened first. On rem oving the skallcap we found the vesselsof the alma mater highly conhested. There was a great congestion of all the veins between the convolutions. On dividing the hemispheres nothing uenusal presented. On opening the ventricles no morbid appearance, and contents natural when cutinto. The base of theo brai had nothing but general congestion. There was no fracture or injury on the bDase Of the skull. The chest presented extensive and very oldstanding adhesions between the pleural surfaces of the left side. l'ight side free. The lungs both highly engorged, but with no traces of disease. The pericardium contained a fluid ounce of bloody cerum. The heart large, thin, and flabby, but no diseaso or deposit; all four of the cavities perfectly empty. The liver was enlarged, dark, and congested. Gall bladder empty. The spleen and pancreas, stomach, and intestines healthy. Kidneys large aud highly congested. Bladderhealthyandhalf fulL On dissection coagula was found under the spots corresponding with the bruises on each side of the jaw. We attribute the cause of death to suffocation (asphyxia), and not to natural causes. The Coroner inquired the probable cause of asphyxia, The witness replied.-We believe it to have been caused by some description of violence, such as a hand placed upon the mouth and the nose held. The Coroner then summed up, remarking that if they accepted the medical evidence there could be no doubb that deceased imet his death by violence. The jury, after a cousultatiou, returned a verdict of "Wilful Murder against some persons unknown," and the proceed ings, which had lasted five hours, then closed,
SUDDPEN- DEATH Th A CX ATEL.-A startling in- stance of the uncertainty of human life occurred on Monday evening at Bath. It was the weekly prayer-meeting of the members of Argyll Chapel, overthe congregation of whichthe late Rev. W. Jay, the eminent Independent minister, has presided for between 50 and 60 years. Mr. It. P. Lemon, one of the deacons of the chapel, had just engaged in prayer, and the congregation were about to sing a hymn, when it was observed that Mr. L-mon still remained leaning upon the table In the communion pew at which he knelt while praying. As he did not risa some of those near him touched m, hut, as this had no effect, an effort was made to rouse him, when it was discovered that he was deal. As may be supposed, the most intense excitement was occasioned bv this discovery, Mr. Lemon having bsen for many years a most active member of the chapsl. The painful news soon spread throughout the city, in which Mr. Lemon was well k-nown and highly respected both as a tradesman and a member of the Town Council, to whioh he had been reelected for the ward of St. James the same day. The de. ceased gentleman was 56 years of age. His body was at once removed to his residence on the North-parade, where it was received by his surprised and sorrowing wife and family. Disease of the heart is supposed to have beea the cause of death. THE COHNISH FiSEmmRIEs.-A few nights ago a sean belonging to MIr. Hitchen, of St. AQnes, caught 300 hogsheads of pilchards, ncearly all of which ave been oured for the foreign market.

OPRNING OF SNO W'S-FIBLDS RAGGED SCHOOLS The newr ragged schools recently erected near Weston. street, Southwark, were yesterday opened in the presence of a vast assemblage of persons residing in the vicinity. These schools have been built at a cost of 7001., exclusive of 2751., the purchase-money of the freehold site. They are intended to receive 400 of the destitute children with whom the neighbourhood abounds. The burildings comprise a schoolroom (a lofty airy apartment of 40 feet in length by 20 feet in width), a committee-room, and a library and reading-room. Upon the occasion of opening the school yesterday a public meeting was held, over which the Eart of Shaftesbury presided, supported by Mr. Wilbraham Taylor, Mr. J. iayne, Mr. J. l?ennings, the eov. J, Robertson, and other gentlemen. Mr. PALaIER, the secretary to the instibution, read a report, in wbich it was stated that the local society originated in lS4S, when a smaU house was hirad in which a school was oDmmenced, but the number of attendants soon exceeded the capabilities of the premises, and a larger schoolroom was then procured, which in its turn had been found insufficoent. The present buildIng was therefore the result of a gradual accuamlation of funds, and the committee had been enabled, with the assistance of their treasurer, Mr. Pellew, who advanced them 501., to pay the price of the freehold, and they had raised 4001. at interest to aid in paying for the erection of the building, but, the contract being 7001. for the erection and fittings, they were stiU 300. minus the required sum, for the making up of which they looked to a philanthropic public, who they were confident, seeing the importance of the undertakdng, would not fail to givo them the required aid. On the motion of Mr. T. Fococx, seconded by the Rev. Mr. RoWsRTSoN, and supported by Mr. PAvys: and Mr, OLIPHANT, the reDort was unanimously adopted. The Earl of SHiFTSBURY then addressed the meeting, and stated that he felt great pleasure in being present, in order that he might congratulate them on the success which had attended their efforts, and on the completion of the excellent and commodious building in which they were then aembled. His friend Mr. Payne and himself had for years worked together in this work, and they had for years been of opinion-and he was glad to find that many others had now arrived at the same conclusion-that they could not undertake a more important work, one more in unison with the spirit of the Gospel, and one better calcelated to promote the best interests of the country, then by loking after the education of those classes of children who were to be found in the great hives of industry, and of those who were wandering about destitute among the dense population of London. No doubt, in carrying out such a work there vwere great difficulties to be met with, but they had their rew for all these in the improvement which had taken place among this class of the population. They had of late years seen where large masses of the people were congregated together, sometimes under circumstances of considerable excitement, and at other times for the purposes of amusement, how peaceable they were, how circumspect,and he knew that those in authority, after having witnessed those assemblages, had gone to their homes rejoiced at the noble and orderly demeanour of the peoplo and at their high appreciation of their own privileges, ws well as of the rights of each other. Few things appeared more startling to foreigners than the order and decormm which prevaUed on the opening of the Crystal Palece and on the occasion of the funeral of the Dmke of Wellington. Few things, eertainly, could strike foreigners more than the conduct of the people of this country in 1848; for, while so many thrones were in the dust, and the people of so many countries in dire commotion, so peaceable and orderly were the people of this great capital that Her Majesty the Queen might have walked from London-bridge eastward to Whitechapel and westward to Grosvenorsquare without meeting anything but expressions of the greatest respect and loyalty. (Hear, hear.) That showed the effect of these efforts upon the lower orders of the population; and they were stiU further and perhaps more strikingly exemprlifed by the gallant soldiers while in the Crlmea. Could anything have been more striking than the letters sent home by the private soldiers? They were written in a Christian spirit, and in such a manner as showed the influence of the Sabbath school and similar Institutions. Then, again, it was the same with the soldiers in India during the crisis which had arisen there. The same spirit andthe same evidences of moraltraining pervaded the whole of the letters received from theae gallant men. He referred to that because the private soldiers were drawn from the poorer classes, and it was among these class3s espeeialy that the effect of such institations as these were put forth. It was the Sunday school, the open-air preaching, and such like appliances that raised in their minds feelings and principles which danger and difficulties often so strikingly developed. He could instance the conduct of the gaUant troops before Delhi, who, though their feelings must have been worked up to the highest pitch of excitement by the massacres of their countcy. men and countrywoomen which had taken place, never retaliated exeept in a manner becoming Engrlis soldiers. (Hlear.) He had seen a letter from a young friend of his who was with his regiment before Delhi, and he stated that during the assault every time the cry oame to load and fire the cry also came along the line, "Spare the women and chUdren." (hear, hear); and that noble soldier General Wilson had in his address to the troops prevlous to the assault impressed upon them that duty. The noble Earl concluded his address by earnestly impressing upon his auditors the duty of supporting such institutions as that 'which they had met that day to promote and which had been found to confer such great and valahfs blessings upon the community at large. A vote of thanks was given to the chairman, and the meeting separated.
THE WELL AT CAWNPORiE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It is not likely that you will bestow much more of your space upon my suggestion (so kindly and favourably reeived by yourself and your correspondents) of a memorial temple for the well at Cawnpore. IJnless reoalled, therefore, by some unlikely circumstance, I leave the matter is other Ikeeping, contented that something will now be done, though, I fear, something very different from what I intended and proposed. WiU you, however. just permit me one or two remarks on the four letters which you publish to-day? They probably represent a large amount of public opinion regarding my second letter. 1. I have never proposed the erection of any particular church for this memorial and this warning. My first lette suggested a " Christian temple," and I expressly left it for future settlement whether the church should be "Episcopalian or Nonconformist." Then camne the prompt announeement and advertisement of theoPropa. gatlon Society. I saw, at once, the turn which the scheme vwould probably take-viz., in the direction of the church of England; and immediately argued, that, to be a national undertaking, those views must be represented in the future temple (as far as we could provide for it)J which would carry the sunport of the largest number of Christians outside the establishment. Tens of thousands of Dissenters, I hope, would be willing to aid in au episoopalian church, where the doctrine of justification by faith was to be fully taught. I trust not one Dissenter would lend a hand where a massacre was to be perpetrated on the surface more fearful than that tho victims ofl which smouldered underneath,with sacramental forms for scimeters, and something worse for a proy than flesh and blood. (I am far enoutgh from applying this descriptIon to the ancient society in question-as far as possible; but I have the best reason for remaining in the belief that that society would not succeed in rendering this effort national, in the sense jnst in dicated. Your columns, however, are not the fit arena for the discussion. It is only necessary for me to say, that the work of that society is not the work which I was the instrument of suggesting in your jonrnal.) 2. The letter of "S. L,," proposing the erection of a 33aptist chapel, precisely illustrates the danger against which I wanted to guard, in the opposite direction. For myself, I might have proposed an Independent chapel; Mr. Drummond, an Irvingite chapel; and where would the end have been? What we want, Sir, is not, in this instance, to spread a form of worship or to teach an exact creed, but to erect, by the largest possible number of English Christians, a Christian place of worship. Pray don't let us have In the Ohurch of Christ another race of functionaries whose only aim is "H ow not to do it !" 3. I hope that a " Sussex Incumbent" i3 merely confused, and not sophistical, when he tries to fasten upon me the adoption of extremes of my own in the act of protesting against other people's. I hope he fails to see as well as to allow for the fact, that the church of England is not Eng. Iish society. Bishop Wilson, of Calcutta, isnot an e.xtreme man as regarde British Christianity. There are such persons as Dissenters. For the moment I have been willing to be reckoned myself among the extremes at one end-I put bigh churchmen lat the other. I am willing to say " Let neither extreme build a church at Cawnpore;" the " Sussex Incumbent" is not. My friend forgets that I surronder something,-a good deal (though not, I hope, a good con science), in asking for anything but a lNonconformist church He will surrender nothing. "Good Dr. Wilson" is the tia media between us. I beg to apologise for the length of this note, and Sin cerely to thank you for the opportunity of recommending the idea of my fellow-traveller to the British public. It must now rest with stronger and wiser men to determine whether that hideous grave shall be the site of a Christian sanctuary or not-outside which coming generations of Hindoos will learn not to trifle with the faith of Britain, and within which native converts will worship in the spirit of Reber's hymn- Waft, waft, ye wlnds, HIs story, "And you, we waters, roll, Till, like a sea of glory, "It spreads from pole to pole."

MR. A YRTOH, M.P., AND HIS CONSTITUZNTS. A public meeting of the inhabitants of the Tower Hamlets was held on Tnesday evening at the Beaumont Institution, Mile-end, for the purpose of hearing from Mr. A rton, MYP., a statement of his proceedinga in Pariament as a repro. sentative of the borough. Mr. R. CHARLES, jun., took the chair, and after a few observations introduced Mr. ATRToN, M.P, who was most warmly received bv the meetiug. The hon. member said he came there to a his constituents whether, in their opinion, he had to their satisfaction filfilled the honourable and onerous office of their representative in the House of Commons. (Hear.) He wished to acquit himself of a prevalent idea that he had been too active a member, and that he had contravened the conventional understanding that a new member should sit tongue-tied and motionless until he was sufficiently instructed by those who had sat longer in Parliament, (Laughter. ) He knew that he represented a constituency which could not bear an idle member, and he hpld acted acsording to the best of his judgment, knowing the vast moral power which he had at his back. (Hear, hear.) After referring to the necessity for a general instead of local rating for the relief of the poor and his conduct with regard to the coalvrhippers in their pplication to Government last session, the hon. member explained his reasons for opposing the BiU for abolishing grand juries. That Bil was not simply to abolish the'"thief's grand hope," but was entirely subversive of all personal liberty, giving the Attorney-General complete power to im. prison any man at any moment, either with or without reason. Anotber measure which he had opposed, and for which he had been much condemned, was the Bill for preventing the sale of obscene prints. That BiU as originally framed gave piwer to any policeman, vrithout warrant or previous examination, to enter a man's premises, to seize pro. peoly and destroy it at his own option. He conceived that to be a dangerous power, and recommended certain amendments, which were finally adopted, and had been found to act most beneficiaUy. (Liear.) The BilL for the Improve. ment of the Dwellings of the Labonring Classes was ano. ther of those specious instances of pretended philiuthropy, but which were really calcalated to sanction most serious intrusions upon the rights of the poor, and compelling every parson who mi'ht be summoned before a police magistrate to prove tte exact degree of affinity batween hirself and other residents in the same room. The Govern. ment appeared to consider the present House of Commons the same as the last, perfectly ready to adopt any scheme for the creation of new boards or departments, and accordingly they came forward with a budget of centralizing measures, which he had felt it his duty to oppose, includ. ing the Savings-back Bill, the Burials Bill, the Board of Health Abolition Bill, and others, all of which measurps it had been his duty to resist, and in almost every case with success. THear, hear.) There were also certain measures of public benefit which the Government had promoted in the iast session which he had supported, such as the Divorce ough he regretted that the law had not been frameadso as to give the poorest classes the same privileges as were enjoyed by the wealthier classes. Upon that occasion he took the opportunity of suggesting the doctrine that the Church of Englaud should not be governed by the State, but should be controlled by the people of England. (Hoar, hear.) Adverting to the great question of the day, the recent outbreak in India, the hon. member observed that, having had some experience in that country, he might be supposed to have some knowledge of the circumstances which had given rise to the recent outbreak; bat, in truth, he found it quite impossible, among the many and con'dicting reasons which were assigned, to fix upon the one which had led to the recent disasters. The fact was that it was not a single cause, bat the accumulation and concurrence of many. For the government of India there was reaUy no one responsible. The Ministers at home repudiated responsibility, because there was an East India Board of Directors. The Directors shifted it upon the Governor-General, who, in his turn, repudiated it, because the officers under him were sent out from England, and were not appointed by himself. No one was responsible for disaster but Providence. (Hear, hear.) But a hittle research would soon prove that there were causes for the Indian disasters traceable to human shortcomings. We had extended our aims, grasping territolies in aU directions, deposing princes, occupying territories, each accession of territory rendering a further advance necessary in order to enlarge our revenues. Oar latest annexation was Oude, upon the plea thar the ruler of that country had nisgoverned his people; but, considering that he had been under the control of the British Government, if there had been miagovernment, the fault rested with ourselves. The King of Oude felt aggrieved by our proceedings, and accordingly declared his intention to present an appeal to the Queen of England. As long as that appeal was panding the country remained quiet, but when it failed the fermentation was brought to a head. The storm came, and the whole army of Bengal revolted from the British flag. Another cause was the war with Persia, which naturally led that Power to agitate among the Mahomedau population of India, and to create trouble for us in our own territories. Then, again, it was the height of imprudence to leave the vast magazines of Delhi in the uncontrolled keapiug of a native armyanother cause which had been too much overlooked from the prevalent deference that was paid to certain classes in this country. The chief command in India was the greatest military prize in the gift of the Government, and when that great oince fell vacant, two years since, it was not Elled up bry the appointmeent of a well-h:own veteran who had faithfully served his country, but was bestowed upon an officer who was a boy at Waterloo, and had not seen much service since. In ten years he had attained the rank of Lieutenant. Colonel, and from that time for 30 years he had been a faithful follower of the Whig party in Parliament, which was held by a Whig Government to be a sufficient qualifica. tion for the chief command in India. Of course, the ap. pointment of such a man offered a tempting invitation to those who desired to shake off our rule, and they sald, "Now is our time; the army is commanded not by an experienced soldier, but by a political civilian, and let us seize the opportunity to free ourselves." (Hear, hear.) Another cause was the injury we had done to the religiouq feelings of the natives of India. He acquitted the Government of aU desire to convert the people of that country, but at the same time it was the more criminal for the Government to give cause for the apprehensions of the native population. He believed it was plain to aIl people now that the outbreak was not, as the Government styled it. a mere milital y mutiny, but was really, as Mr. Disraeli had expressed it, a revolution. It was a revolution attempted to be carried out in the only manner possible in India-viz, by the armed forces transferring their allegiance from the East India Company tn the Emperor of Delhi, That revolution, how. ever, would fall, not alone from the valorous exploits of Britsh toops, but because we had not completed our work of destruction among the native princes of India, as those whom we had yet spared had been found our strongest bulwark, without whom our task of reconqunest would be still more onerous. Whie he entertained the strongest feelings of horror and detestation at the atrocities which had been perpetrated, he must express his great regret that any person in this country should recommend a course of revengeand retaiiation to our soldiers which would disgrace our flag and dishonour our army. If it were true, as he had seen stated in native papers, that an officer having been firedunonin aviliage immediatelyorderedit to be burnt down and destroyed some 300 men, women, and children, he (Mr. Ayrconl could not sympathize with the feeliugs of such a man. (Hear.) lie had bsen much pleased to see the proclamation issued by Lord Canning upon that subject, although be confessed it seemed somewhat impracticable. It was to be hoped that our reconquest of India would not be followed by a determined attempt on the part of our Government to compel the natives of the country to adopt orr own views of relgion. Unless the people of India were allowed to follow their own notions in religious matters we should find the possession of that empire a drag upon our prosperity and a danger a our greatness. (Hear, hear.) The ever-recurring difficulty in this and in other mnatters was that great offices were filled not by merit, but by selection for other qualities than fitness for the duties, and that could only be remedied by a really free ,nd popr'ar House of Commons.. (Hear, hear.) A measure of Parliamentazy re-orm had been promised for the next session, and he hoped would be brought forward, notwitistanding the excitement caused by the Indian outbreak, and that that mea.- sure would h3 whet it ought to be-one to seoure a more ex. wended and untri. meled representation of the people in Parliament. The hon. member concluded by expressing his hopes that his past conduct had met the approval of his constituents, and that the opinions which he had expressed were in accordance with their own. (Loud cheers.) A resolution approving of Mlr. Ayrton's Parliamentary conduct was then adopted by acclamation.

MIURDER OF A PoICEMANS AT STEVENAKAF, HERTS. -This quiet little village has been thrown into excitement by tho comnmission of oue of the foulest m-urders recorded for a long time. A policeman, who has only been iu the neighbourhood a few weeks, was noted for his vigilance, and had, it appears, often stopped men with stolen property, was misued on Friday night last. He wrs seen going his rounds about 5 o'clock, and was never seen After tMl nlonday morning, when be was found in a pond about halfa-mlile from the village, vith his throat cut so frightfully that his head was nearly severed from h's body. Near the pond was found some loose grain, and the ground bore evident marks of a severe struggle having taken place, and at a distance of above 90 yards some more loose corn and some blood, so that it appears that lie tried to apprehend some one, or m,ore, with stolen corn, and that one or more committed the murder. His coat was hacked about a great deal about the neck. The coroner has held an inquest on the body, and adjournied till Monday. TIwo brothers named Carper,ter have been taken up, and there seems strong suspicion against them. The murdered man was about 25 years of nge, and caine from St. Alban's. f Advertisement.1-" Sevmour and His Friends," a novel, by the anithor of Tbe Beer't Marriage," 3 vole., Just pub'aBed.

LAW REPOIR 1' COUJRT OF CRANOERV n:- .t SKELTON v. cor ' (Before tae LORDS JUSTrCE SOF APPEAL.) 'Xhis was an appeal from a decr:c of "ic.e-Chancellor Stuart dismissing the plaintiff's bilk with ci*tv. The suit is one for the specific performance of an agreemcnt for the sale of part of the Paston Estate, inr Norh!jamp.,:un-hire, the Iacd betng tbree miles from Peterbarornh, r.ar the Walton station of the Great Northern Railway ; the price 7,3001. The plaintiff was the intended pnrchaswr. The c:,sa was one of contract or no contract, depending on sr v-ral letters passing between the plaiatiff and defendant. bil one side it sas contended that there was, in fact, no con:luded contrant, but only a bargaining; while on the *,ther han.d it was said that there was a recognition in vriting of a verbal agree. muent, and that therobythe exigencies of the Stattute of Frauds was satisfied. r MaIms and MIr. Prendergast wrre connsel for the appel]ant-the plantiff; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Tripp for the repondent, the alleged vendor, were not called upon, except as to costs. Lord JcStSoe I-TIGHT BRUCE was of opinion that inde. pendently of anyquestion on the Statute ,,f Frauds, the case was so near the boundair between negotiation and contract, and it wvv9 so reasonably doubtful, to say the leawt, whether the defendant ever intended, or ever represeited that he intended, to bind himself, that it wonld he dangerous for the coxrt to exercise its jurisdiotion of sp^cifio performance, especially Ps an action might be brought. He was also of opinion that the requirements of the Statute o,f Frauds were not satisfied. Tho appeal would be dismissed, but the counsel for the defendant would be heard upon the question of costs. Lord Justice TuxJ-g3R considered that thnre was not sufficient in the case to satisfy the Statute of Frau.ls, and that the appceal most be dismissed. Ic was to ba remarked that throughout the correspondence which was alleged to form the contract the name of the purchasvr was never mentloned. Mr. BAcoq and Mr. TR1rir were then heard on the question of costs. Mr. MALINS addressed the Court on the samne point. TUeir Lomustis decided that the bill should be dis. missed without costs, and no costs were to be given on either side of the appeaL
VICE-CHAIWELLORS' OTuRTR N Iv 1 90TTT14V.TzV v -1- (Bcfore Vice-Chlancellor Sir J Srr-. iS. 'lflis vas a bill praying for a declaration by the Court that the plaintiff, by virtue of a Judgment entered up and registere by hni on the 5th of June, 1855, was entitled to a valid charge on the real estate of Samuel Bayley, com prised in a deed of composition, dated the 27th of August, 1855, and thereby conveyed to trustees. The facts of the case were as follows :- On the 21st of May, 1855, Samuel Bayley, a cattle-dealer, filed hbs petition for a private arrangement 'with his creditors in thet Court of Bankruptcy for the Birmingham district, and by an order of Mr. Com- orusloner Balguy, the commissioner in Bankruptcy for that district, made on the same day, protection from process was granted to Bayley until the 18th of June then next, in pursuance of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Aot, 1849. On the same day the Commissioner made an order appointing a private sitting of the Court on the 18th of Juno then next, 4or the proof of their debts by Bayley's creditors as directed by the above Act. On the 2d of June, 1855, Mr. Charlc3 Waterfield, the registrar of the Birminghaaxt District Conrt of Bankruptcy, made an order purporting to be a protection from process to the person and property of Samael Bayley until the 9th of July then next, and such last-mentioned protection purported to be under a petition by Bayley presented to the Court on the 1st of June then stant. On the same 2d of June Mr. \Vateriield also made another order, purporting to be an order for v private sitting of the Court, to be held on the 9th of July then ensuing, for the proof of debts by Bayley's creditors; but the order last mentioned did not state whether the registrar making the same was acting under a petition of the 21st of May or the 1st of June, -No petition, however, was presented to or filed in the Birmingham District Court of Bankruptcy by Bayley on the 1st of June, but upon that day the petition of the 21st of May appeared to hma, been marked or endorsed as follows:-"Allowed to be refiled on tho lst of June, 1S55. - C. Waterhield, registrar." On the 29th of June, 1855, Bayley filed his propoeal for a compromise with his creditors, and he thereia proposed that hisunsecured creditors should be paid a composition of 10s. in the pound on the amount of their unisecured debts respectively, such composition to be paid to thens by two equal instalments of 5s. in the pound, on the 'th of September, 18,5, and the 'Dth of January, 1856; and la order to secure the payments of these Snstalments Bayley proposed to convey and assign the whole of his real and personal estate and effects to trustees unon trust for sale, and for the benefit of his creditors. On the 9th of July, 1855, the creditors assented to the above proposal, with some modification by the trustees, and the 27th of August was appointed by the commissioner to confirm the proposal as modified. On the 27th of August, 1855, the creditors signed a resolution, agreeing to the modified proposal, and on the same day an order, purportiag to be a con6rmation of the resolution by the creditors, was made nnder the petition of the 21st of May, 1855, such order reciting that Bayley did on the 21st of May "last present his petition to that Court," and that "John Balgny, Eq., the comminssioner of the said court, acting in the matter of the petition, caused such sittings of the Court to be held as were directed by the Act." By indenture dated the 27th of August, 1855, Bayley conveyed and assigned his real estate and all his book debts and sauns of money owing to him, speclfied in a schedule, and his household effects to the defendants Sidney and Croydon, upon trust for sale, and to apply the proceeds in payment of the debts due to the creditors of Bayley, parties to that deed, in the proportion of 10s. in the pound upon their debts, and to Day the surplus to Bayley. The plaintiff did not executo that deed, and he never assented to it. Subsequently to tho date of the deed the trustees contracted for a sale of some of the real estate to a purchaser who was also a defendant. In the early part of the present year Bayley was ad udged bankrupt. By the provisions of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act and the general orders in bankruptcy the registrars of the Court of Bankmrcptcy are enmpowered to make orders in place of the commissioners in cases of emergency. Mr. Shebbeare and Mr. Roxburgh were for the plaintiff; Mr. Elmsley and Mr. Horsey for the trustees, and Mr. . Roupl for the purchaser. The V CE-CILnUCELLOR said the plaintiff in this case wa-s a judgment creditor and claimed to assert hisrightassuch against the real estate of Bayley, and the plaintiff mnst prevail unless the defendants the trustees could show that by the provisions of the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act they had acquired a right which must displace the plaintiff's right as a judgment creditor. The question was whether the deed under which the defendants claimed to be trustees for the creditors of Bayley was valid under the Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, 1849, and gave them a right which should have relatIon back to the date of the petition or order on the petition of the 21st of May, 1855. The acts of the bankrupt and of the parties evidenced a course of proceeding whlch was highly frregular and inconsistent, and altogether failed to show a compliance with the express requisitions of the above Act. First, as to the petition that purported to have been fBled on the 21st of May there ap,)eared an order for refiling on the 1st of June, and on the 2d of Jtane an order was made entirely different from and inconsistent with the order of the 21st of May; but there could not be two valid and inconsistent orders. The inconsistency lay in this, that in the order of the 21st of May the 19th of Jane was fixed for the prIvate meeting of creditors, wbereas the order of the 2d of June fixed the 9th of July for such meetino. That was a glaring inconsistency which affected the whole of the subsequent proceedings. Persons asserting a right under an Act of Parlia,,ient were bound to show strict compliance with the Act. The irregularitv was not merely confined to the extraordinary olroumstance of reftling the petition and to the reglstrar's order superseding the commaissioner's order without expressly saying so, but the subsequent proceedings purported to be based on the order of the 21st of May, instead of that of the lst of Jutne. Thus the proceedings which formed part of the title of the defendants evidenced a degree of carelessness, inconsistency, ,Knd irregularity which It was somewhat deplorable to see In a court of such hIgh importance. The object of the Logislature was that a proposal made by a debtor which had been confirmed by the commissioner should he precisely carrled out. The proposal recorded was a proposal to assign all the debtor's property; but the deed did not purport to assign the whole of it; that of itself would he fatal. The proposal further was to pay a dividend to all the creditors, but the deed provided that the dividend should be paid only to these creHltors whom it mentioned. Ills Hononur proceeded zo consider the arguments for the trustees on the other points raised, and said it was unneceewery for him to declde the caseauponPthose.points. There must be a declaration that theplaintiff was entitled to a valid charge in priority (Bfcore Vwx-Chan.cclor Sir W. P. WOOD,) 55As.uW v. MITA1:Ir. This was abill seeking to restrain the defendants from manufacturing reels or labels for sewing.thread with the plaintiffs' crest or trade-mark affixed, or fromu in any way imitating the reels or labels, or the trade-mark of the plaintifl, and from selling any sewing-thread, except that manufactured by the plaintiffs, by the use of the trade-mark or crest of a griffin, or under the siaiue of the " griffla cotton,"1 The plaintiffs had brought on the suit to a bearing without having moved for an interlocutory injunction. Mr. Rolt and Mr. Sidney Smithi appeared for the aihtiffs; Mr. Cairns, Mr. Hamilton Humphreys, and wur. Baggallay appeared for the defendants, but were not caled on, The VsCE-CIsIsACELLOR said that it was most unfortunate that this case should have been brought to a hearing after what had taken place at the interviews between the parties, Looking at the evidence, it wag quite cleer that he could not dispose of the case in favour of the plaintiffs without an examination of the witnesses in court, or directtng an Issue at law. An interview had taken place between one of the plaintif and an agent of the defendant Mitarachi as far back as February last, in which the plamntiffs obtained all the information necessarywith respect to the cotton which bad been sold with a particular mark of theirs. The plaintiffs refused to supply the defendant with cotton labelled with this mark, but did not warn him that he could not legally obtain it elsewhere, or, in fact, caution him against the use of this mark. There was, no doubt, seone conflict of evidence as to what took place at thi interview, and he had to balance between the testimnony of a party to the cause and that of the defendant'.s difrnewsi elt otiln that he could at once even adopting the account given by the defendant's witness. In such a case he could not have grante,l the injunction without examining the witnesses bimEelf or directing an iEsue. He was relieved, however, from tlhis difflculty by whathad subsequently happened. No steps were taken by the plaintiffs nor inquiries made until Jnne, when, at an interview between the parties, the defendant offered to abandon the use of the mark, and to give an undertaking to that effect ; and a further offer was made by him after bill filed to abide by an injunction, each side bearing their oss a costs. A fairer offer could not have been made to the plaintiffs, and as they had persisted in bringing on the matter to a hearing after such an offer, which would have met the whole justice of the case, and iu respect of an invasion so very trifing, the bill must ba d6missed with costs.
1 COTRT OF QUEEN'S BENCH.-WESTnIISTm Nov. 4. I IHADDOCK. V. TROTMAIN AND OTIHP.s. (Sitings in Banco, before Lord CAM?pIp'LL and Justices COLERIDGE. WIGIHTMAAN. aad ETtLE.) l0Mr. COLLIER, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Powell) moved Ior a rule to show cause wvhy there should not be a new trial in this case, upon the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was against the evidence. The action was in ejectment, the plaintiff being the heir-atilaw of a Mrs. Higgins, a lady who lived near Lydney, in Glocestershire, and who had died at a very aavanced age. The parties represented by the defendants claimed the property as devisees under a will made by tbe deceased only a* short time before her d2eath. The testatrix, after giving some legacies, devised the remainder of her property, one-half to her cousin Mrs. Lewis, who was living with her at the time of her death, and the other half to a Mrs.liott, the mother-in.law of Mr. Smitb, an attorney at Newnham, who made the will. The question left to the jury was whether, when the deceased signed the paper in question on the 14th of April, 1855, she was in a sound and disposing state of mind, aad whether the paper in question contained her wilL The jary ware absent some time, but not being able to agree upon th.ir verdict they again came into court, and were told by Al r. Baron Martin, who presided at the trial, that they ought to find their verdict for the defendants if they thought hMrs. Higgins had signed the will in a sound and disposing state of mind, and they were satisfied npon the evidence that it was her wiUl and the intention of her mind to dispose of her property as was expressed in the will. But his Lordship added, he was not aware that such a case as the present had ever occurred before; and he then directed the jary that if Mrs. Higgins was of a sound and disposing mind, and meant Mrs. Lewis to have one moiety of the pro. perty, but had no intention that tho other moiety should go to Mrs. Elliott, the jury ought to find a verdict for the plaintiff as to one moiety. The jury therefore found their verdict for the plaintiff as to one moiety. Lord CArIPBELL intimated his opinion that this direction was correct; but inquired whether there was anything in the evidence which would support such a finding? Mr. CoLLIER went into the facts of tho case at considerable length, with a view to show that the verdict was against the evidence. He said that at the trial the case of the devisees was treated as one and the same; but now Mrs. Lewis was of course satisfied with the verdict, and the present application was made on the part of Mrs. Elliott. Lord C.ADIPBELL said the learned cunsel might take a rule to show cause. TIIE QULEE V. PATREY -ND ANOTIHER. This was an indictment for a nuisance, which terminated In a verdicb for tho Crown. Mr. BOVILL, Q. C., now moved for a rale for a new trial, upon the ground thatevidence had beenimproperly received. The indictment charged the defendants with creating a nuisance on divers days between the 1st of May, 1856, and the time when the indictment was preferred, by bh-rning animal charcoal at their sugar manufactory in WhitechapeL. As many as 40 or 50 witnesses were examined on each slde, the one set of witnesses saying that it was a nuisance, and the other that it was not. In this conflict of testimony Mr. Serjeant Byles, who appeared for the Crown, tendered In evidence a conviction by one of the metropolitan pollce magistrates, and dated the 7th of Marcb, 1855. 'his was a conviction under the Smoke Nuisance Removal Act (the 16th and 17th of Victoria, o. 128), wbich made it an offence to carry on any trade in the metropolis which should occasion any noxious or offensive effluvia, without using the best practicable means for preventing the same. The learned counsel sald he had objected to the reception of this evidene, as amounting only to the opinion of the magistrate, and pronounced upon another and different question. Mr. Justice WIcT;sAN said he had warned the learned serjeant that, if admitted, it would be at his peril. It was admitted to show that the defendants had notice that they weremaintaining a nuisance. Mr. BOVILL said the evidence was nicely balanced, aud he supposed the learned serjeant thought the conviction would turn the scale. The COURT granted a rule nigi. HARTTY V. COLEMAN. Mr. hl. CIIAIMBERS, Q.C., with whom was Mr. Hawkins moved for a rule to show cause why the verdict in this case, which had been found for the plaintiff, with 2001. damages, should not be set aside and a new trial granted upon the ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was against the evidence. The action was brought to recover damages for an injury which the plaintiff had sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendant's servants. At tbe trial, whlch took place before Mr. Justice WiUes at the last assizes for the county of Essex, it appeared that the defendant had been employed uuder a local board 'of health to sink a well on a public highway. In making the well the defendant's servants bad necessarily thrown the earth upon the highway, but they had neglected to mark the danger at night by a signal-lamp, and that the plaintiff, driving along the road upon his wrong side, was thrown doxvn and injured. The defendant pleaded a plea of " Not Guilty" by statute. The learned counsel contended that the plaintiff had contributed to the accident by riding on the wrong side of the road, and that, according to the evidence, there was sufficient light from a lamp in the neighbourhood to enable the plaintiff to have seen the obstruction. He also con. tended that the defeudant was not liable, on the ground that he was bodt fide acting in the execution of the Public Health Act, and by the 140th section of that statute, the 11th and 12th of Victoria, chap. 63, he was exempt from personal liability. The astion, he contended, onght to have been brought against the clerk of the local board of health, under the 13Sth and 139th sections. Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that no rule ought to be granted in this case. The first ground relied upon was that the verdict was against the evldence, and that the plaintiff had materially contributed to the accident. But there was no evidence to support that aUegation. The going on the right side of the road when he had no reason to apprehend any obstruction was what the plaintiff had a right to do, for, though the rule of the road was convenient and ought to be observed, still if a person had no reason to suppose there was any obstruction, he might go on the right, or on the left, or in the middle. With respect to the lamp, it was for the jury to say whether there was not negligence in not ha-ing another lamp. The jury thought there had been neglgence, and that the plaintiff did not contribute to the acedent. The only question, then, was against whom the action should be brought? The defendant was employed by the Board of Health to dig a hole for a well. which he might have done with his own hands, but he employed his servants to do it. They dug the hole in the highway. That was justifable; but they left the hole in the highway without a signal to warn people of the danger. That was negligence in themo, and it was also negligence in the defendant, ancd unless some statute absolved him he was answerable for the consequences. The Health of Towns Act was relied upon, but it contained no such enactment. Where there was no negligence the person who did an act in obedience to the instructions of the local board of health was not liable ; but if, in doing such an act, he was guilty of negligence in the manner in which he-did it, whereby loss and damage were occasioned to another, he was personally liable. Mr. Justico COLERIDGE and Mr. Justice WIGIITMAN expressed themselves to the same effect. Rule ref used. CLARR V. STORM%ONT. Mr. ITAwvisin moved for a rule to set aside the verdict found for the plaintiff for 26Z. ls., and for a new trial, upon the ground that the verdict was a perverse verdict. The 4th count stated that the plaintiff had delivered a horse to the defendant upon the terms that the defendant should keep it for a week, and at the expiration of that time should either keep the horse for the sum of 261., or return it to the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded that before the expiration of the week, and without any negligence of the defendant, the horse died. At the trial, which took place before the Chief Baron Pollock at the last assizes held at Chelmsord, it appeared that before the horse wmc delivered to the defendant it appeared to be unwell and refu'ed its food, bat this was lightly treated by the plaintiff as only wvhat was sometimes customary with young colts. Soon after it had been delivered to the defendant the horse appeared to be very ill, and in a day or two it died, as was supposed at thetime, of colic, for which laudanum, turpentine, and braudy were administered. But on a post mor-tcm examination it was found that the death was cauced by inflammation and obstruction of the bowels. The jury acquitted the defendant of any 'iegligence, but they nevertheless found their verdlit for the plaintiff for the value of the horse. The learned Chief Baron had immediately stayed execution, in order that this application might be made. The COURT granted a rule nisi. DARMIAN V. POTTER. Mr. COLLIER, Q.C., moved for a rule calling upon the defendant to show cause why there should not be a new trial in this case, upon the Rround that the verdict, which had been found for the plaintiff, with 30s. damages, was perverse. The action was brought by a man who kept a lodging-house in Pimlico to recover damages for an injury sustained by the negligenb driving of the defendant's servant, whereby the plaintiff was knocked down and ran over, his collar,bone broken, and himself laid aside for 15 weeks. The learned counsel said the negligence of the defendant's servant was clearly proved, and, if entitled to a verdict at all, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to some adequate compensation; but it was quite nugatory to oive him a verdict for 30s. under the circumstances. SueTi a verdiet could only be the result of a compromise among the jurmmen. Lord CA.MPBELL said the Court conld not grant a new trial, except on the payment of costs ; but they thought it would be better that the verdict should not be disturbed. Rule refased.

THE ACCUMULATION LIFE AND GENERAL (Sittina in Banco, & 1Wmelma; Tmn, befere Lori Chief JustieC COCKBUN and JTUsUicas WILLTAAS, CROWDER, and WiLLxs.) in this case Mr' ATHERTONr, Q.OC., with whom was MLr. Keene, appeared to show cause against a rule obtained by Mtr. Petersdorif to enater the vercdict for the defendants, or for A nonauit1 0o the ground that the defendants had not com, mitted a brea-h of their contra^t. The action wavs brought by the plaintiff on a policy of insurance for i 00L, aud by the policy three of the defendants, as directors, undertook to carry on the business of the insurance-office unt:i a certain period, when the plaintiff should partake of a share of the profits, and upon his death should pay the amount of the poly in consideration of the premium paid by him. The prlintiff complained that, having entered into this contract with the defendants, they had Isince amalgamated with asother company, and had entered into engagements which precluded their fulfilling their contract with the plaintiff, and had thus broken their implied covenant with the plaintiff to keep sheir funds to answer his olaims. Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mfr. Petersdorif appeared In support of the rule. The case was partly heard yesterday, and was concluded this morning. The LoRn Cmam JJSTr1CE, in giving judgment, said he was of opinion that the rule ought to be made absolute for a nonsuit. Three q"estlons presented themselves --First, whether there was any implied covenant on the part of the defendants to keep the funds of the company to answer tho plaintiff's claims whenever they might arise? Secondly, whether the defendants had done anything whereby those funds had been alienated, so as nob to be forthcoming to meet the plaintiff's claims? And thirdly, whether the time had arrived when the plaintiff was entitled to bring his action against the company? On the first point it seemed to him that no Implied contract arose. It was contended that an implied covenant to continue the business of an insuranco company and keep the funds available to answer the claims of the plaintiff arose on that part of the policy which provided that the funda of the company only should be liable, and not the shareholders personally. It appeared to him that all that was Intended by that clause of the policy was to protect the shareholders from indivldual liability. As the law stood the funds of the company would be liable, and in the event of the funds not being enough the plaintiff would have his remedy against the shareholders. This clause was not intended for the purpose of enlarging the policy, but to deprive the policy holder of a certain power, and to protect the shareholders from the liability. He therefore thought no such covenant as that contended for arose, and that being so the whole matter fell to the ground. As to the second proposition, it seemed to him that the company had not done anything to divest themselves of their funds, for he found no provision for the amalgamaion of the company at at, hut one only for its dissolution, and it was provided what should be done with the funds on such dissolrtion. The provisions in that case were here tought to be applied to the condition of the amalgamation ; but it seemed to him that what had been done was ultra vires, and that the plaintiff might still have his judgment against the funds of the company. Thirdly, it was contended that the time had not arrived when the plaintiff could claim. If the defendants had made profits the plaintiffcould haveclaimed his share. Independently of the profits the plaintiff could liave no claim until his policy became due. It was an action qWia timet for some injury which might never arise; for non constat that the company would not satisfy the policy when It became due. The other learned JuDGEs, in their judgmentc con. curred- Rule absolute. --
COURT OF EXCHEQUER. WsDXmsDxY. Nov. 4 BOT.'rTO V .TnVVQ (SiUing in Baanco.) Mr. MELLISH moved to set aside the verdict which passed for the plaintiff in the Pasgag Court of Liverpool, and to eniter a verdict for the defenidant. It appeared that one Brocklehurst, with whom the defendant had had dealingo, sold his business to his foreman, the plaintiff., and that thle defendlant, not being aware of the change, sent a -written order for certain goods, addressed to Brocklehurst, which the plAintiff fulffiled, aind for which he afterwards sent in the hbll in his own name. The defendant, however, refused to recognize him in the matter, as he claimed to set off his acount agaiust Brooldeh=rt. UJnder the direction of the learned assessor a, verdict passedl for the plaintiff, and it was now argued that an the order had been sent to Mr. Broclele. hurst by name, It -was not competent to the plaintiff to converb it into a contract with himiself, he being cognizant of the change, while the defendant was not. The learned counsel further contended that the plainatiff ought to have reected the ordler or explained the real state of things to the defendant before hie took upon himself to execute the order.

In this case, in which a rule to set aside the verdict for the plaintiff was yesterday obtained by Mr. Grove, Mr. ALLEN~ now movedl for and obtained a cross soale to retain that:verdict on a point resrved to him at the trial, in the event of the defendant's rule being mnade absolute. The question was -whether the defendant, who began at the trial, and whose case rested on the validity of a will, haa given suffioient proof of an ineffectual search for the a'ttest. ing witnessesto enable him to dispense with their evidence. One of these witnesses was dead, but the other was alleged to be in Australia, and thereforeo beyond the reach of English proces. To prove this fact witnesses were called, the effect of whose t-estimony was that in their belief, foundedl on conversations with one Williams, who had seen the attesting wvitnes in Australia, and the receipt of a letter from him by the hands of the said Williams, the attesting witness was in Australia ci . the time of the trial. It was now objectedl tlast Willams himself ought to have been called, and that other and more dlirect testimony of attempts to find the attesting witness at his usual haunts and residence ought to havebee gien y th deendnt.The learned counsel cite "Spone v. ayne (4C.B. 32), as a case in which all he eadng ecIIonson hissubectcouldl be found.

Both vessels belonged to the United States, and the collision took place in the Irish Channel about midnight on the 28th of April last. It was alleged on the partof the AndrowFoster that thatveaselwas proceeding from New York to Liverpool 'with a general cargo, that on the night in question, the weather being dark and stormy, she was close hauled on the starboard tack, when she saw the light of the other vessel coming in an opposite direction, and that she kept her luff, as she was entitled to do, notwithstanding which the collision occurred, and she rapidly filed and went. down. The Andrew Foster attribated the collision to the delay of the Tuscarora in porting her helm, caused by the bad look out kept by that vesseL On the other hand, the Tuscarora, which was on her way to Philadelphia with a general cargo and 500 pas. sengers at the time of the accident, alleged that it was caused by the stArboarding of the helm of the Andrew Foster, and denied that she had kept a negligent look out. Both vessels carried lights, and it was agreed that if neither of them had done anything the accident would not havo happencd. Dr. Deane and Dr. Spinks appeared for the Andrew Foster; Dr. Bayford and Dr. Twviss for the Tuscarora. The learned JuDGE, in leaving the case to the Trinity Brethren, observed that, as these were both American ships, they were not bound by the 296th section of the Merchant Shipping Act, bat their conduct previous to the collision -must be judged by the general law of the sea. The TRIN1TY BRETHREN were of opinion that the Tusca. rora was wholly to blame for the accident, and The CouRT accordingly pronounced for the damage. TIIE S. GILDERSLEEVE.-SI LVAGE. This was a suit for salvage promoted by Hercules Towells, the owner, and the master and crew of the steamtug Perse. verancea, again6t the owners of an Armerican vessel called the S. Gildersleeve. It appeared that on the 11th of April last the Gildersleeve, bound from Havre for Cardiff, ran ashore in Stolford Bay, Somersetshire, was got off by the Perseverance, and was conveyed to Cardiff Roads. According to the statement of the crew of the Perseverance the vessel was in a perilous position, and was not saved without great difficulty. It was, however, alleged by Cicero Brown, the master of the Gildersleeve,that the vessel had merely inn into a bank of soft mud, that she was not in danger, and that the Perseverance had beeni merely engaged as a tug to tow her into Cardiff Roads. The value of the Gildersleeve was 8,2001., and that of the Per. severance was 4,3501.; a tender of 251, had been made to the prom oters of the suit and refused. The Queen's Advocate and Dr. Deane appeared for the Perseverance; and Dr. Addams, with Dr. RobWuson, for the The TRNIrTY BRETHREN were of opinion that the ship was in a position of considerable peril requiring the assistance of the steamtug, and The learned JUDGE awarded the sum of 4501. to the salvors. 3I3Sh'rE5 OF THE COURT.

CENTRALO COIMIZNA, COUBT, Wednesday, Nov. 4. 1EW noTmPq' (Before ahe COssoN_SERJxANT.) William Ryan, a respectable-looking young man, said to be a cabdriver, so'rendered to tske his trial for assaulting Thomas Mears upon the 21st of September. Mr. Robinson and Mr. T. Atkinson proaecuted; Mr. Sleigh was for the defendant. The prosecution was at the Instigation of the Tondon General OmnIbus Company, and, in consequence of there beiDg an indictment against Mr. Kite, the promoter and pilneipal of another line of omnibuses running against those of the comprny, for a conspiracy in procnring and in. stigating the above-named defendant to commit the assault, the proceedings created considerable interest among the fr-iends of bothi parbies. The court was very much crowded throughout the whole trial. The case, which commenced yesterday and was resumed this morning, did not, as far Ps the public are concerned, present auy features of importancs. The prosecutor of the ind1ctment is a servant of the London and General Omnibus Compuny, and upon the night of the 21st of September, at about 12 o'clock he and several other servants belonging to the company were at the Lamb public-house, Kingiland, in the concert-room, Prosecutor had just sung a song and was about to repeat it when Ryan came in and began speak. ing to a man named Coppasd, formerly in the employment of ite, but now the servant of the comp3ny. Ryan said to him, "Ateyou themanwhostruckmycousin?' Coppard 8aid, "He struck me and I struck him agZain. Ryan then said, "Thathe meant to fight," but Uovpard said, "He would not." Ryan then turned to the prosecutor and said, "Oh, it is you, Mr. Mears; ysu are A. No. 1," and instantly struck the pipe from his mouth, following it up with a blownupo tna mouth and another upon the nose. Ryanthen seizea 'a by the arms, dragged bim over the table in front, and fell upon him with his knees upon his chest; a mob then rushed into the room and a general row ensued. Kite came in with them and said, "You are on the wrong man," and going up to Meara said-" Oh, Tom, I would not have had is happen for anything." MeaTs had his coat torn, and Kite said he would [give him him coat and others if he would come home with him. Kite gave him something to drink, and expressed great sorrow for vwhat had taken place. Some short tilne after that the landlord of the Lamb, having given Ryan and a mxan named Hockey Into custody, Mears went up to the station and charged them both. Hockey was let out the next day at the police-court upon Xite paying the expense of the damage done by him. Hears was for eight days under the doctor's care. Iears, in cross examinatlon, said he wished to proseoute Ryan, hut had no wish to prosecute Kite, and should not have gone On witb, this if the company had not caused him to do so. Mr. James, of Kingsland, surgeon, deposed to having examined dears the day after the assault and fiuding the left breast and shoulder much swollen and bruised; he was also otherwise injured. A great many other witnesses gave precoisely the same account of the assault upon Mears, all swearing most poei. tively that he never spoke to Ryan nor offered him any offence whatever, and further, that until Ryan had got Mears upon the ground and Kite and his party rushed in, there were not more than 12 persons in the concertroom, nearly all of whom gave evldence of the assault. It was also stated that as Kite came in he said to Coppard, uaing very foul language, that he was the man whom they intended to serve out. Kite also expressed his regret to Mears's brother at what had taken place, stating that Ryan had attacked the wrong party. Mr. SLxIGH, for the defence, most energetically denounced the conduct of the Omnibus Company, who had Instituted this prosecution for the purpose of crushing Mr. Kite simply because he had been successful in preventing the company from monopolizing the whole of the traffic upon the road where these omnibu66es ran, and they sought to do so by fixing a charge upon the defendant at the bar, that they might then put Kite upon his trial, 'which was the main obiect they had iu view. He had, how ever, en entire answerato the charge. The lea!ned counsel then called several witnesses, who swore as positively as did the parties for the prosecution that at the time of the assault above 30 people were In the room, and that Mears first assaulted Ryan by a pnsh, and told him if he wanted to fight he might fight him, and that they had two fairstanld-np rounds. Kite wee also called, and he most positively denied what had beeunsaid as to the part he took iu the affair, or that he made the remarks imputed to him. In answer to this evidence Mr. ROBINSON called writnesses, and anong them the landlord of the Lamb, Mr Preeman and Mr. Harwood, the manager of the concert, and they most distinctly stated that the witnesses called for the defence were not in the concert-room at the time the assault was committed. Mr. Freeman added, that when he asked Kite how he came to bring the disturbance to his house Kite said, he did not mean it to have taken place inside, adding, " They are like wolves or eagles aud cannot wait for their prey.1' Each of the learned counsel having been heard in reply. The COMMON-SERn.5NT summed up, and remarking upon the conflicting character of the evidence said, there was nothing to show that this quarrel had anything to do with the affairs of the company; if it was anything, Kite had done it to avenge an assault by Coppard upon hLs brother. The jury almost immediately Acquited Ryan, and the other indictment, in which Mr. Sleigh, and Mr. Metcalfe for ilte, appear, was postponed until next session. This case concluded the business.

He prayed an adjournmenf. having discovered that he had omitted three debts from his schedule-of 501., 401., and 381., respectively. The COUnT adjourned the case untll the 27th of November, and renewed the protection which had boen_granted to the insolvent on the 30th of July. when he fled his schedule, which he swore to as containing aU his debts. IN RE ELIZABET3 FRANCOSS. This insolvent, a corset maker, was a married woman, but long separated from her husband. She was opposed by Mr. Symons, who, through his attorney, had discounted a bill of exchange for her upon an agreement that a particular pianoforte should be his security. The pianoforte was after. wards takes by Mr. Manktelow, who had originally sold it to the insolvent, and the case was adjourned for an explana. tion of that proceeding. Mr. Manktelow to-day stated that the insolvent had pledged another pianoforte, which he had lent to her upon hre, and he had to redeem it at a cost of 231. To compensate him for that loss he, with the insolvent's consent, took the other instrument, for which she had paid him, but he was not aware that it had been promised to Mr. Symons as security. The learned 003nrssloxn said the insolvent had not treated Mr. Symons quite fairly, and ther,fore could not be immediately discharged. She would be remanded for a space of three calendar months from the (late of the vesting order (September 3).
POLICE. MANsIoY-Rousm-ohn. Edward Kauffman, a clerk in the General Post-office, St. Martin's-ia-Grand, was summoned for the second time, having failed to appear on the first occasion, charged with having on the 24th ult. unlaw. fully and fraudulently affixed to a letter a certain postage sbtmp which had been gotten off a certain other letter, whereby he had incurred a penalty of 201. He again failed to appear, and the Post-office solicitor desided to proceed in his absence. Evidence 'was therefore given conclusively proving that the defendant on the day in question removed a cancelled rO nny postago stamp from a letter about to be sent out for uelvery and affixed it to a Private letter of his owvn, with the intention of sending that letter~ asfor delivery, as if it had been posted in the ordinary way. Be 'was detected in the act, and, being suspended by the Postmaster-General in consequence, had absented himself from his usual place of abode. Alderman CuBiTT inflicted a penalty of 20s., with Ss. 6d. costs; for vrhich, if not paid, the body of defendant wlll be answerable, provided he can be found. Bowv.srTx'r.-A post-offiee letter carrier named James Bagley, attached to the W.O., or Western-central office, in Southampton-street, Bloomsbury, and occasionally em. ployed to sorb and stamp letters there, was charged with forging the signature of Mr. W. J. Slade, of Guilford-street, Russeli-squate, to the receipt at the foot of a post-office order, and an elderly man named John Embleton was charged with uttering the order and receipt with the signature so forged. The prosecutor is a gentleman having friends at Poole, and on Fzlday last his father, Mr. Ri. Slade, of that place, addressed a letter to him containing a post-office order for 21., which, however, never reached him. It probably passed into the hands of the prisoner Bagley when engaged in sorting letters at the district office. On Monday Mr. Siade inquired about it at the General Post-office, and on his representation a fresh order -was granted, and the money paid to him. Soon afterwards the prisoner Embleton appeared and presented the original order, to which the signature " W. J. Slade" had been appended. He was handed over to Tyrrell, the constable of the money-order department, who took him to the controller's office, where he stated that the order was intrusted to him to get cashed by a man named James Slade, but known as " Jim Slade," who lived in Brydges-street, Drury-lane, and was a pendealer. Embleton aLso said that he was a p en-dealer, and had known Slade maDyyears. Upon Tyrrell saying that he would seek Slade at the address stated, Embleton said- I If you can't find Slade, ask for Bagley." On inquiry he ascertained that no such person as Slade was known there, but he found Bagley, who said he had been asked to get the order cashed by a stranger, who accosted him on Saturday as he was delivering his letters in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. He was to have half-a-crown for getting the order cashed, and he had agreed to give the half-crown to Embleton. He was to meet the stranger, whom he believed to be the W. J. Slade for whom the order was intended, at a house in Broad-street to give him the money. Tyrrell then apprehended him. The letter in which the order had been enclosed was found on Embleton. They were both comniitted for triaL MARLBOROTGHUSTREET.Janes Eadie, a betting man, was charged with creating an obstruction in Tottenhamcourt-road Police-constable Gordon said a great many complaints had been made by the inhabitants of the annoyance and obstruction occasioned by betting men congregating in certain thoroughfares to make their horse-racing bets. He was in Tottenham-court-road that day, when he saw the defendant with a betting-book and a pencil in his hand, surrounded by 30 or 40 betting-men. He told the defendant to go away, as he was creating an obstruction. The defendant refused, and be took hfim into custody.

WORSIP-STRE:ET.-About a week ago a young woman of superior speech and deportment, aud who gave her name as Burb, applied to Mr. H sMLL for assistance under these circumstances:-The applicant stated that she was forrnerly in very comfortable circumstances at Melbourne, in Australia, where her husband was a clerk in the post-office and that on the sudden death of her husband, about three years ago, she was still left with sufficient provision to mintain a respectable position. Instead of being satisfied, how. ever, with this state of affAirs, she some time after became acquainted with a man who represented himself as possessed of considerable property in Wiltshire, And, as he appeared to be of independent means, and moved in the best society that'was found there she istened to his overtures and married him. The result of this credulity was as might natx. rally be expected, for her husband, having no money himself, squandered, in less than a twelvemonth, all the money she possessed, with the exception of about 801. deposited in one of the Australian banks6 and to also obtain possession of this which she was very reluctant to part with, he fabricated , story that he must go to England to look after his property, and, drawing up a will, by which he constituted her the sole legatee, he deposited it with her, and she thereupon drew out the balance of her money and handed it to him. On reaching this country he took some out-of-the-way lodgings at Mile-end and immediately indulged in such drunkenness and disspation that he not only drank up what littl6 money they had left, but deprived her of her watch neckehain, and everything else that could be converted readil into drink, and flnally, about a month ago, was brought home at 2 o'clock in the morning by a constable, who had discovered him helplessy drunk in the streets. This was more than she could endure, and upon his return to conisciousess she bitterly upbraided him withhis heartless conduct and deception throughout towards her, when he coolly put on his hat and left the houte, and she had seen nothing of him from that day to this. What few articles se ha by her she was now obliged to selito kcep herself alive, and when these wore all gone she was compelued to go with her child 1-to the workhouse, the matron of which cosniserated her wretched condition, and advised her to lay her case before the magistrate. In support of this statement the woman produced EOme Vof her wedding-cards, marriago certificate, and the will she referred to, the latter of which was drawn up in such a plausible manner as to induce the belief that it was really based upon tangiblo property, but upon a close examination was manifestly intended for nothing but deception. Mr. HuArALL pitied the poor woman's wrongs and hamded her a soveresgn from the poor-box, hoping it mnight lead to more, and the consequence was that the following contributions have been forwarded for her, some of which wererequstedto b ackowlegedit this paper :- ' ; *" C- X " if.; "E.," 11.;i " Fve mites," Sn; 14, fi.; nd L,"2s.Themagstrteshave also received the following donations for the poor-box".A.C,," 104; "G.

The prisoner and his friends had been out drinking, and when proceeding along Arlington-street ho was seen by police constable Lodge, 144 G, to go up to the prosecutor's and steal the knocker in question. When the prisoner was stopped by the policeman and asked what he had got he at once replied, "O h, I have taker a knocker off," and produced it from his pocket. When he was searched at the station some bones were found upon him and he was rather fraid tthat he should be kept in custody for the Waterloo. bridge tragedy. The prisoner, in defence, said he was very sorry and that the like should not occur again. Mr. TYwrwrI said that hb thought the day of wrenchlag off knockers had long gone by. As the case resolved itself into one of damage, ho should allow the prisoner to settle with the complainant, if he could. 'rhe parties then retired, and it was afterwards stated that the case had beon settled. SOUTUWARx.-Edwin Filn, a tall powerful-looking Irlshman, was chared with committing a murderous attack upon Joshua Thomas, police-constable 259 M. He wos also ch:rged with being concerned with others in assaulting George Cole, 262 M, while in the execution of his duty The rt constable, whose head was bandaged, and who appeared to be very much Injured, stated that about halfpast 2 o'clock in tho morning he heard a disturbance in wer-streot, Gravel-lane, and on proceeding there he saw several persons quarrelling, among whom wan the prisoner, who appeared to be the most violent of the lot. As soon as he approached to quell the disturbance he received several blows, and was knocked down. While on the ground the prisoner Idcked hinm several times on the body, and as he was endeavouring to recover himself some one threw a chamber utensil at him from a window, which struck his head, cutting him in a frightful manner. At that timo the prisoner escaped, but on another police-constable coming up they forced an entry into his house, and took him into custody. Mr. BuRcnAu asked him whether he was much hurt? He replied that ho was. As soon as the prisoner was secured he went to the divisional surgeon, who dressed his wounds and sent him home to bed. The doctor could not tell the extent of the injuries at present, thinking it better to let them remain for a little while. He was, however, in much pain and unable to perform his duty. Cole, the second constable, whose face was much disfigured, asd t a lttle before 3 o'clock his attention was attracted to a disturbance and cries for assistance in Ewer-street. He proceeded there and found last witness on the ground, the prisoner holding himi and kicking him. Witness seized the prisoner by the collar to pull him away, when a mob collected around him, and he was pulled into the passage of a house and the door shut against him. lXe caught hold of the prisoner to secure him, when he said if he did not let him go he would kick his - head off. IXe then escaped, but afterwards he assisted last witness in securing him. The mob at the time was so violent that he reaaly wondered that murder had not been committed. In answer to the charge, the prlsoner said that he was attacked by a party who lived near him, and he got away from them and escaped into his house. He denied being theoperson who assaulted either of the constables. Mr. BURCHAm told him that the constables had been most seriously assaulted, and any amount of punishment he could Inflict would not be adequate. He should therefore commit him for trial to answer the two charges. WA.\DswRoslm.-Aortly-looking man, about650 years of age, named Honry Y.chariah Jervis, who described bin. Self as a solicitor, of 62, Newman-street, Oxford-street, was placed in the dock before Mr. LNaG.AX, charged with obtaining money from Mrs. Sarh Parker, an elderly lady who was alleged to be insane, by fraudulent representations. The prisoner, who stated that he had been very ill during the night, was allowed to be seated in the dock. Mrs. Parker was in court, and stated that she had no charge to prefer against the accused. George Neiges, nephew of Mrs. Parker, residing at 45, London-road, said he gave the prisoner into custody on Tuesday night for obtaining 21. lOs. from hi aunt, who was insane, under the pretence of going to Bury St. Edmund's to his (witness's) father about some property. He could prove, if the prisoner was remanded, that he never went to that place. The prisoner had also received in different sums about 181., which he said he had paid to persons for copies of registers and for serving notices. Witness saw him at his aunt's on Saturday last, and he represented that he had filed a bill in Chancery, and advised witness to keep near his aunt, as she would come iato possession of 8,0001. per annum, wiith a title. He also represented that he was a solicitor. It appeared that he had not filed any bill in Chancery and when witness saw him on Tuesday night at his aunlt's lie gave him into custody. Charlotte Houghton was next examined, and stated that she was now an inmate of the Cancer HospitaL She was present when the prisoner received the money. She was then living in the house with Mrs. Parker, who formerly resided in Alanor-street, Chelsea, but now at No. 5, Denbighterrace, Bridge-road, Battersea. She first saw the pilsoner some months ago, when he called upon Mrs. Parker in answer to an advertisement in a morning paper, which had been inserted by lie.Parker, for a solicitor to recover some property. Mrs. Parker represented to the prisoner that her relatives had drawn out of the bank several hundred thousands of pounds left to her by her husband, and that she had only 80,0001. left. She wanted him to recover the money and other property which had been taken. The prisoner took notes and asked questions. Mrs. Parker said that she had three children, when it appeared that she never hud any, and, according to her statement, they were born when she was seven years of age. The prisoner said Mrs. Parker had a good case, and that he would carry it through for606s. The prisoner came several times afterawards and drew money, as ho said, to take him to different places to search after the supposed children and to serve writs. He sometimes drew_ 11 and then 21., but never more than the latter sum. On one occasion tho prisoner wanted 21. 10s. to take him to Bury St. Edmund's to servo a wtrit uPon Ms Parker's brother, and witness lent her l1s. to make up the sm. She also heard Mrs. Parker say that there were very few lawyers of the name in the list, and asked him if he was any relative of Sir John Jervis, and he replied that he was his son. He further stated that he had a sister married to the Turkish Ambassador, that he kept his town and country office, and that he rode about in his carriage. Witness asked him if he lived at No. 62, Newman-street, and he said he did not, but the letters were received there for him. Witness also asked him why he did not come to Airs. Parker's in his carriage, instead of walking through the wet. He answered that he was not ambitious, and that he kept his carriage waiting a little distance off. She smiled anu did not believe him. She therefore asked him if he had any objection to give her a ride in his carriage and he replied that he would be most happy if she would appoint the time and place to meet her. On that occasion he received 21. The money was given to him because Mrs. Paaker thought him an honest man. When he told her that he was the son of Sir John Jervis, Mrs. Parker said, " My dear Mr. Jervis, I thought from the first that you were a great man, as you bear the stamp of it." She also said that she would trust him with thousands if she had it. Witness said at the time In their presence that she did not believe him to be what he represented, and he replied that he would not dis. cuss the matter with her. lIe then told MIrs. Parker to moet him in the city the next day, and when witness intimated that she would accompany her, he said, " Certainly not, as it was on private business." The prisoner obtained either 101. or 121. after he represented that he was the son of Sir John Jervis. Witness had never considered Mr Parkr rght n hr mid. he (rs.Parker) was in the receipt Of 401. per annuim from the Srtoc k-Exchange.in that was althe property she believed Mrs. Parker Dossossed. Te prisoner put several questions to the wiftness to showr tat he wvas first instructed by MIrs. Parker to look after solne property in Dowigate.hiUl and Epping Forest, and afterwards upon other matters which occupied him some time. Mr. INGEAM said he should remand the prisoner for a week upon his repreEentation that he was the son of Sir Jobn Jervi,% brother-in-law to the Tprkish Ambassador and that he kept his carriage, and if he could prove thai those statements were true he (Mr. Ingham) would liberate him upon beiJ. The prisoner denied hAving made those statements. Mr. I1GHAM then remanded him accordingly. Ms. Parker who interrupted the proceedings several times by declaring that the crge was untrue, asked his worship to accept her bail for the prisoner's appearance. Mr. JlGHAx declined, snd the prisoner wga then removed, declaring that Irs. Parker was quite right in her mind.

TRB GUNPOWVDER PLOT.+ Now that Guy Fawlkes, with his inflammable garnish, is again in season, and we are admonished by his votaries to " remember the Gunpowder Treason and Plot," it happens that wre have an opportune aid to our recollections in the narrative lately published by Mr. David l ardine. Many year,, ago it was the office of this gentleman tO write for the Lvlwar~J of RuXe kvnsn{ju Kno.itedge ean intro-I duction to the trials of the several persons impli' cated in "the Plot of Powder, as it was anciently designated," and now, in the present year, the I substance of this introduction has been embodied by the sane writer in the form of A continuous narrative with such enlargements and corrections as subsequent inquiry and research have suggested. The materials for this purpose at present known to exist are very considerable, but they are dispersed in various depositories, public and private. The principal collection of original documents upon this subject at the State Pap,er-offic was arranged and indexed some ?years ago by MIr. Lemon; and as it contains the examinations of the prisoners and witnesses, which occupied the attenltion of the Commiss,ioners for nearly six months, together with numerous contemporary letters and papers connected with the transaction, including the contents, as it is presumed, of Sir Edward Coke's "Iuckram bcay," it is itself a memorial of the diligence with which at the time the facts of the conspiracy were investigated. But there is still occasion for sifting and collating these materials, as the Discourse of thle Mactuer of the DIsco=ey of the GLunpoudler Plot, and which is ascribed to Lord Bacon. was not only the Court version of the transaction, so framed that it might be turned to the beat political account, but is allowed to be a narrative of no historical authority. Moreover, controversy has been incessantly busy with the entire subject, and Catholics and Protestants have made the most opposite inferences as to the parties implicated. Even the docaments In the State Paper-office are not now as complete as they were once known t6 be; and " it is remarkable that )recisely those papers whichl constitutte the most import&nt evidence against Garnet and the otheer Jesuits (ire missinmj." Under these circumstances an impartial inquirer like Mr. Jardine does good service in supplying the lost and searching the dubious passages of the proceSs, in putting his conclusions as to what was proved into a clear form, and in compiling a narrative which is at once brief, popular, and accurate. It is remarkable how recently documents have been found which tend to illustrate some phases of this foul transaction. No further back than 1828 a secret depository of papers was accidentally brought to light in the old mansion of the Treshams at Rushton, and which were apparently concealed about the time of the apprehension of Sir Francis Tresham. These papers, though not specifically relating to the plot itself, throw light upon the causes which led to the conspiracy, and, in conjunction with other known facts, help to explain how " seven gentlemen of name and blood," as Fawkes truly calls them, with associates so amiable and accomplished as these also have been represented, made their preparations for the bloodymassacre of innocent persons, discussed the blowing them to atoms with other intended victims more reasonably obnoxious, and in short, as the Bishop of Lincoln says, attempted to proceed to the extremity of " murdering a kingdom in its chief representatives." Its gentlemanly element was especially a distinguishing feature of this abominable project, and the mutual confidence of the chief conspirators, their bravery, and the sense of duty under which they acted, their anxiety for each other's safety, for their common credit, and especially for the exoneration of their priestly confederates,were so exemplary, the conduct was so different from the design, and the actors were so unlike their object, that their performances read like a piece of burlesque, although in sober truth one of the most sanguiinary villainies ever meditated. "Many of the conspirators, such as Robert Winter, Rookwood, Dl_gby, Tresham, and Grant, were men of large psoessions; others again, such as Percy, Fawkes, and 1eyes, were engaged in useful and honourable occupations whioh raised them far above the temptation of want. The Attorney-General in his speech on their trial describes them as 'gentlemen of good houses, of exceUent parts, and of very competent fortunes and estates.' Not one of thembut Catesby was, in uniary difficulty, and his poverty would have ended at hl mother's death, when the estates of his ancestors would have descended to him in possession. " In another respect, also, we find in this conspiracy men not usually acting in the ranks of insurection - men of nild and amiable manners, refined by a liberal education, averce to tumults and bloodshed, and dwelling quietly amid the humanities of domestic life. Of Rookwood Father Greenway says, 'I knew him well, and loved him tenderly. lie was beloved by au who knew him. He left behind him his lady, who was a very beautiful person, and of a high family, and two or three little children, ;ll of whom, together with everything he had in this world, he cast aside to foUow the fortunes of this rssh and desperate consViracy.' Of Sir Everard Digby's attachment to his domaestic circle his remarkable letter to lis children from the Tower, dated onily a few days before his trial, is a sufficient memorial." We must, moreover, bear in mind that in their own view of the case their project was not only justifiable, but in the highest degree meritorious in the sight of God. "Nothing grieves ie," says Robert Winter to Fawkes in the Tower, " but that there is not an apology made by some to justify our doings in this business; but our deaths will be a sufficient justification of it, and it is for God's catse ;" and in the same conversation he expresses his regret that " the Iuinelss having been brought within a day or two of its execution should be so unhappily thwarted." " If we had had good luck," said Christopher Wright, on the march of the fugitives through the midland counties, " we had made those in the Parliament Eouise fly with their heels upwards to the sky." Casaubon mentions the following fact respecting another of the conspirators. " John Grant," says he, " one of the traitors, on the very day of his execution for his share in this plot, was entreated, by a pious and learned clergyman, to entertain, at the last, a proper sense of his situation, and, duly reflecting upon the magnitude of his crime, with hearty penitence to seek for pardon from Heaven. Grant replied with a cheerful countenance, and full of confidence, 'I am convinced that our project was so far from being sinful, that I rely entirely upon my merits in bearing a part of that noble act ion as an abundant satisfaction and expiation for all sins committed byme during the rest of my life."' Toaccounit for this frame of mind, there are, then, as we said, some well-known historic facts to which such discoveries as that at Rushton have added particulars of importance ; but even these willDnot account for it wholly, nor will any inquiry search the plot to its foundations which does not include the secret and corrupting inftuence of the Jesuit priests and the Jesuit teaching. Mr. Jardine is occupied with the more obvious causes when he enters upon a preliminary statement of the condition of the English Catholics and of the laws passed against them. In the latter years of the reign of Elizabeth these were extremely severe and oppressive. A penalty of 201. for every lunar month during which they absented themselves from a Protestant church, if the penalty were exacted, maade R-omanism an expensive luxury. The person who heard a mass forfeited 100 marks, the priest who said it forfeited 200. The priests ordained since the beginning of the Queen's reign were proscribed and banished under pain of death. Convicted recusants must abjure the realm; if they did not depart or Teturned withont license they were guilty of felonv. ana might suffer death as felons. t is true these' laws w.ere not always enforced to their full extent, but their rigourous execution was threatened when money was wanted, and their efficacy was sufficiently tested as fiscai expedients. The fathers of the conspirators Tresham and Catesby, and Throckmnorton, their uncle, were by this means in continual adversity and disgrace. Edward, cousin of the -conspirator Ambrose RBokwood, was thus reduced to absolute want and died in Btury GaoL As for the -priests, they were like hunted vermin, lurkina in woods ancd caverns, crouching behind watnscots and in eecret recesses, with casuistic manuals, mouldy food, and other foul conveniences, and a Catholic gentleman's house was not uncommonly in respect of its contrivances like "4 the wicked house" which Wasesome years ago brought to light in West-street. Towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth invitations were sent by means of Thomas Winter and Father Greenway, two of the subsequent conspirators, to invite the Kiing of Spain to invade this country. To this pass had come the patriotism of such of the Roman Catholic gentry as were clearly under the influence of Jesuit ministrations. This niasion, however, was with'out effect, and, shortly C=fore the Queen's death, Percy, eventually a conspirator also, was sent to sound King d A NanZ aivc of the Gun po?vZer Plot. By David Jarn,7 Eq., ct tbe Mi4Xj F9 mple, Barrister-at-Low, . ).w7 $7. - James in Scotland, and James bei:ic a Sturt, with the English Crown in prospect, and eager to come "South," we can conceive no greater readiness to lie. That Jacobus did lie we aava not the slightest doubt, and accordingly, whez± Percy came out of Scotland " he said that thi King's pleasure was that his Lordship (meang the Earl of Northumberland) should give the Catholics hopes that they should be well dealt with, or to that effect !" James subsequently denied that he had given authority for this; but we cordially agree with Mr. Jardine in his inference that " the simple denial of James on a point of this kind is not entitled to much credit." In fadt, if we may credit the Earl of Northumberland and the French Ambassador, he had written with hMs oown hand to the Earl aforesaid that the Roman Catholic religion should be tolerated. Accordingly, 'the Catholics expected on his accession a con- siderable mitigation of the penal laws, and on the' death of Queen Elizabeth Sir Thomas Tresham, inter alios, " with considerable personal danger, and against much resistance on the part of the local magistrates and the populace, immediately proclaimed him at Northampton; while his two: sons, Francis and Lewis, with his son-in-law, the Lord Monteagle, supported the Earl of South- : ampton in holding the Tower of London for his! use." For the first two years of James's reign the ' fines forrecusancy were thereupon remitted. In the last year of Elizabeth they had been 10,3331.; in the second of James they barely exceeded 2001. but in 1605, the year of the Gunpowder Plot, they rose suddenly to more than 6,0001. Thus in proof of the assertions made with respect to the King's promises one of the heaviest oppressions under which the Roman Catholics of England laboured was for a time suspended, and hopes were encouraged which were soon to end in disappointment. How speedily James threw off the mask, and how readily he returned to the rigorous measures of his predecessor, was shown both by his language and by Acts of Parliament. The old fines against recusancy were again imposed and arrears demanded. To the needy Scottish followers of the King the lands and goods of wealthy recusants were assigned by name, and the Roman Catholic nobiUty and gentry were driven to compound with foreigners for the preservation of their estates. Jesuits and Seminarists were commanded to depart the realm; Roman Catholics were disabled from educating their children in their own faith in England, and if they sent them to be educated abroad they were made liable to a penalty of 1001. Lord Montague, who protested in the House of Lords against the passing of the above provsion, for the warmth with which he expressed himself was committed to the Fleet. Sir Everard Digby, soon to become a conspirator, wrote to Lord Salisbury warning him of " the massacres, rebellions, and desperate attempts " which were shortly to be expected. "F or," said he, " it is a general received reason among Catholics that there is not that expecting and suffering CoUrse now to be run that was in the Queen's time, who was the last of her line, and last in expectance to rum violent courses against Catholics; for then it was hoped that the King that now is would have been at least free from persecuting, as his promise was before coming into this realm, and as divers his promises have been since hs coming. All these promises every man sees broken." Here there is so much of the cause and occasion of the plot as history exhibits clearly, and this should not pass out of sight, though we may ascribe the plot also in no slight degree to the influence of the Jesuits' teaching and intercourse, irrespective of their cognizance and sanction of the design itself, in which it is too late to deny their entire participation. After sonre further negotiations with the King of Spain, which the discontent of the Romanists led them to attempt, and after these negotiations had failed, the design of blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder presented itself to the mind of Robert Catesby, a gentleman above six feet high, with a noble and expressive countenance, of attractive conversation, imposing manners, and dignified character, but with previous tendencies t'. insurrection and conspiracy, and otherwise,. lapt to the purposes of his Jesuit preceptors. He, with John Wright and Thomas WVinter, according to the authentic Fawkes, " first devised the plot, and were the chief directors of all the particularities of it." It was not till the plot was tolerably mature that the ecclesiastics entered to bless the poniards, or that they were proved to have any visible participation in the actual " business." And here a very curious phenomenon is to be noted-viz., how large a proportion of the confederates in the plot were men who had been, as we term it in these days, " perverted," or who had a spice of perversion in their family antecedents. Catesby's father was certainly originally a Protestant, and it is asserted by Lingard that Catesby was such himself. John Wright had been a Protestant; the parents of Fawkes were Protestants, but on his mother's second marriage with a Roman Catholic he was brought up in his stepfather's religion. Sir Thomas Tresham, the father of Francis Tresham, was originaly a Protestant also. So were Percy and Keyes, two of the conspirators; and Garnet, the Jesuit, was brought up in the Protestant religion, and received his early education at Winchester. It is a natural inference, and accords with all experience, that these gentlemen, or some of them, derived their exasperation and explosie capacities from the very circumstance of their perversion. Catesby himself, apart from his tendency to explode gunpowder, certainly appears to have been a very prepossessing personage, and it was through the influence he exerted over the minds of his associates that he obtained confederates, and that the plot went forward. Winter was alarmed at the scandal which might ensue if the powder should not take effect, but Catesby quieted his scruples by sending him first of all to the Constable Velasco at Bergen to obtain, if possible, the intervention of the King of Spain. Winter's errand was bootless, except that in Flanders Guy Fawkes was recommended to him by Father Owen and the priests there as a " fit and resolute man for the execution of the enterprise." Our friend Guy also is described by Father Greenway as " a man of great piety, of exemplary temperance, of mild and cheerful demeanour, an enemy of broils and disputes, a faithfuil friend, and remarkable for his punctual attendance upon religious observances ;" in short, a man less available for a gunpowder plot than for a gunpowder tea party. On his introduction to the associates Catesby, Winter, Wright, and Percy a mutual oath was taken not to disclose their purpose nor to desist from its execution without leave of the rest, and the five received the sacrament from Father Gerard, a Jesuit missionary, in confirmation of their vow; but the survivors Fawkes and Winter persisted in declaring (we may say Tuantsem valeat after the parallel denials of Tresham on page 125) that the secret was not imparted to the priest. Thereupon Ferris's house, which adjoined the Houses of Parliament, was taken in the name of Percy, while Keyes and John Wright's brother Christopher were enlisted to assist in the construction of the mine. It is not our object to give a continuous history of their proceedings, but only to recall the more remarkable circumstances of the transaction. These "seven gentleman of name and blood" worked away in a cellar, at a wall three yards in thickness, without* intermission from the 11th of December to unriatmas-eve. Fawkes in a porter's frock kept watch, but not one of the others showed himself in the upper part of the house ; and they lived on hard eggs, baked meat, and pasties, in order to avoid suspicion by going frequently abroad for provisions. All day long they worked at the mine, carrying the earth and rubbish into a little building in the garden behind the house, and at night they removed it from the building into the garden, spreading it abroad and covering it carefuUy over with turf. At the same time they consulted respecting ulterior measures, planned the seizure of the Duke of York, afterwardc Charles I., and of the Princess Elizabeth, ard arranged for the general rendezvous in Warwiekshire, where soon after they enlisted various other confederates. In the midst of their deliberations the Parliament 'was prorogued from the 7th of February to the 3d of October, and they separated for the Christmas holydays, taking all necessaay precautions. By the beginning of February, having resLumed their labours, they had half pierced through the stone wall by great perseverance and exertion. Then the incidents ccurred which induced them to chnge their plan, and of which Mr. Jardine thus states the remarkable particulars:- Greenvay relates an incident whch occurred While they were at work, and which is, perrhap~ worth reTeating, a esvidence of the gross superstition hit prevaile among theseo 0satics, nd wallsuadezincig the workingof conscience on he ind oftheconpirtor asthe prceded with thei deign Thy wre ne ay urpise bythe sound of thetoiingof bel, his semedto Proceed from the wJdd. o th wal nner he P~m Ht R , All so. yended t1heirtabour, and listened with alarm an-d-measiness to the m-3terious sound. Fawkes was sent -for from his statioa Above. Che tolling still continued, %nd was distinctly heard by him as well as the others. Mduch wondering at this prodigy, they sprinkled the watl with holy water, w-en the sound instantly ceased. Upon this they resumed their labour, and after a short time the tolling commenced again, nd again was silenced by the application of holy water. This process was repeated frequently for several days, till at length the unearthly sonnd was heard no more. " These ideal terrors were shortly after succeeded by another and more reasonable subject of uneasiness. One morning, while working upon the wall, they suiddenly heard a rushing noise in a ellar nearly above their heads. At first they imagined that they had been discovered ; but Fawkes, being despatohed to reconnoitre, found that one Bright, to whom the cellar belonged, was seling off his coals in order to remove, and that the noise proceeded from this cause. Fawkes earefully surveyed the place, which proved to be a large vault, situated immediately below the House of Lords, and extremely convenient for the purpose they had in view. The difficulty of carrying the mnine through the wall had lately very much increased. Besides the danger of discovery from the heavy blows which it was necessary to strike in penetrating the stone foundations, they found that as the work extended towards the river the water began to flow in upon them, and not only impeded their progress, but showeed that the mine would be an improper depository for the powder and combustibles. Finding that the cellar would shortly become vacant, the conspirators agreed that it should be hired in Percy'snAme, under the pretext that he wanted it for the reception of his own coals and wood. This was accordingly done, and Immediate possession was obtained. The mine was abandoned, and about 20 barrels of powder were forthwith carried by night across the river om Lambeth, and placed in the cellar in hampers; large stones and the iron bars and other tools used by them in mining were thrown into the barrels amoDg the powder, the object of which Fawkes afterwards declared to be ' to make the breach the greater,' and the whole was covered over with fagots and billets of wood. In order to complete the deception they also placed a quantity of lumber and empty bottles in the cellar. The preparations were complete about the beginning of May, 1605. They then carefully closed the vault, having first placed certain marks about the door inside, by whick they might at any time ascertain whether it had been entered in their absence; and, as the Parliament was not to meet till the 3d of October, they agreed to separate for some months, in order to avoid the suspicion whioh might arise from their being seen together in London." Foreign countenance and co-operation were in the next place sought for. Fawkes was despatched to Elanders to communicate with Sir William Stanley and Owen, and Sir Edmund Baynham was sent to Rome that he might be their representative with the IPope when the news of the explosion would arrive. That Garnet, the Provincial of the Jesuits, was implicated in furthering these nissions; that he knew their true purport; at all events, that his own asserted presumptions in this behalf were ingenious falsehoods Mr. Jardine proves clearly. Soon after Fawker's return from Flanders the Parliament was further prorogued from the 3d of October till the 5th of November, whereupon Catesby's preparations of an armed force went forward, and Sir Everard Digby, Ambrose Rookwood, Francis Tresham, and the Littletons were drawn into the conspiracy. It has been commonly supposed that the plot was discovered through Francis Tresham's misgivings aud desire to warn his friends. Mr. Jardine here investigates the various speculations respecting the authorship of the letter to Lord Mounteagle, and the curious doubts as to whether this letter was not a device to conceal the prior revelation of the plot by Tresham in a different manner. The circumstances under which the letter was received, Tresham's intimations to the confederates that the plot was known, his anxiety that his friends should fly, his pressing offers of money to Catesby, and it is added by Roman Catholic writers, though this Mr. Jardine discredits, Tresham's own death in prison are supposed topointto the conclusion that the plot was disclosed by some machinery of which the Government were unwilling to risk the exposure. And it may be added there is at least sufficient mystery in the circumstances to warrant the close scrutiny to which they are here submitted. At all events, the discovery of the meaning of the ambiguous expressions in the letter to Lord Mounteagle was not due to the discernment of the Royal Solomon, for Lord Salisbury, in his relation of the transaction to SirCJharles Cornwallis, the Ambassador to the Court of Spain, and also in a narrative of the discovery of the plot, to be found in the State Paper-office, declares that this interpretation of the letter had occurred to himself and the Lord Chamberlain, and had been communicated by them to several Lords of the Council before the subject had been mentioned to the King. To the suggestions of the same discerning personages it was also owing that the plot, though discovered, was allowed for a week to run its course, and that no search was undertaken at the cellar till the 4th of November, the day before the meeting of Parliament. Then Guy Fawkes was seized, the rest of the confederates were suddenly "wanted," and the plot, after a flight and feeble insurrection, came to a close in the various trials with the tenour of which we are familiar. The laborious examinations to which the accused were submitted were principally directed to ascertain the extent to which the Roman Catholic nobility and the Jesuit prlests were concerned in the consplracy. "With respect to the former," says Mr. Jardine, " no positive evidence was obtained, and no threats, promises, or torture could draw from the principal conspirators the slightest inculpation of the Jesuits." On the contrary, though several of them were induced to admit minute facts and circumstances, indifferent in themselves, but leadingothe way to subsequent discoveries, they all strenuously denied that the priests were in any degree privy to the plot. Yet no doubt existed from the first as to the complicity of Father Greenway, and, though controversy has from time to time been renewed on the subject of Father Garnet's guilty knowledge of the design, after Mr. Jardine's patient and scientific analysis of the evidence on this point there can be no reasonable doubt that this guilt is also brought home to him. It is observable that the general question of Garnefs moral guilt (for about his legal guilt there could be little doubt) has been the subject of warm discussion at various times during the last two centuries. There has been a natural desire on the part of Roman Catholic writers to exculpate the Provincial of the Jesuits in England. and as natural a resolve on the part of Protestants to vindicate in every respect the sentence by which he suffered. Bellarmine took up the cudgels in his behalf against James L To him Launcelot Andrews, Bishcp of Chichester, rephed in an extremely acute and powerful pamphlet. Then L'Heureux, the Jesuit, defended Garnet under the title of " Eudeemon Joannes." Then Isaac Casaubon replied on the other side with eminent skill and candour. " Eudsemon Joannes" came on again, and was effectively answered by Abbott's Aiitilogia. In 1678, at the time of the Popish Plot, the controversy was renewed. The Bishop of Lincoln then republished the papers printed by the authority of James I., and appended to them a number of letters written by Sir Everard Digby from the Tower, then lately discovered, and which are not only extremely interesting, but throw much light upon the point in question. Dr.Williams also wrote a History of the Gwunywder Treason, and subsequently a vindication of it, both implicating Garnet strongly. In more recent times, at the date of Roman Catholic emancipation, Mr. Butler, on the one side, and Mr. Townsend, on the other, renewed the controversy, and now Mra Jardine, with judicial impartiality, discusses the points of Garnet's justification, and excludes all hesitation asS to the true and final verdict. It is not possible for us here to enter minutely into an argument which extends to the length of 40 I pages, but we may just in a few sentences indicate some of the points discussed. The substance of Garnet's justification, as pleaded by himself and his apologists, was that he had only heard of the plot ! from Greenway tunder the seal of sacramental conIfession, so that in religion and conscience his Ilips were entirely closed; while lie represented !himself as really abhorring the design of the Powder ITreason, and endeavouring to prevent its execution to the utmost of his power. If he had so heard of it only in this way, reasons Mr. Jardine, he was bound, according to the best authorities, to have disclosed it zo far as to have prevented it. But he himself admits that he had a "general knowledge" of the plot from Catesby, not under the seal of confession, and as to the full and particular disclosures by Greenway he vacillates and contradicts himself. Now, Greenway told him the matter in confession; now, "he cannot certainly affirm that Greenway intended" so to do; " it might be that such was not his intention, though he (Garnet) always supposed It was." Asked to state plainly whether " he took Greenway's discovery to be in confession or no?" he answered " that it was not in confession, but by way of confeasion." Lastly, admitting to further conference,s on the project, " walking about" and "-as oftenT as they met," he could only urge that they " had ]:elation to the first and consequently to confession," though here the Jesuit writers disallow the aistinVotion he contends for; while ttere could never have been the shadow of a doubt in his mind, confession being in his eyes a sacramental ceremony, whether the matter was told him in confession or not. But Garnet not only wrongfully concealed the plot; be wilfilly deceived Parsons and the Pope in a letter which he wrote July 24, 1605. He spoke peace, on the one hand, when he knew there was no peace, while, on the other, he assured Sir Everard Digby that the priests were not to hinder stirs, " neither was it the Pope's mind they should, that should be undertaken for the Catholic good." This duplicity is referred by Mr. Jardine, who takes into account Gar- X net's relations with the conspirators, to " no other motive than a desire to promote their purposes by absolutely preventing any interference from Rome." Garnet's whole conduct, so far from showing abhorrence of the design, is consistent only with the desire that it should be carried into effect. Be was the friend of the chief conspirators; he had avowedly participated with them in two previous capita 3treasons; he had repeatedly shown them the Pope's Breves against a Protestant succession; he was found in constant and confidential communication with them until within a fortnight of the 5th of November; Catesby told him generally of a plot in hand against the King and State, yet he, the chief of his reHgion in England, professes not to have inquired into it; he answered Catesby's question about |" kiDling nocents and lnnocents" together, so as to set Catesby's scruples at rest; a month later, 'acquainted with the ful details of the plot by I Greenvway, he does not even enjoin his Jesuit Isubordintate to abandon this ferocious enterprise; a fortnight before the 5th of November he meets i Catesby at Sir Everard Dig,by's, at Ooathurst; Catesby goes directly thence to London to execute the bloody project, while Garnet, the man who insi3ts that he abhorred the plot, who for months before' could not sleep by reason of his alarm, goes to Coughton on the 29th of October, quietly traveling with a principal conspirator to a place hired by that conspirator, expressly with a view to the intended operations of the insurgents. There he suggests that " the Catholics, at the beginning of the Parliament, should pray for some good success towards the Catholic cause," and says a verse or two of a hymn for the " taking off a perfidious people." There the insurgents seek him, and thither Catesby sends to announce to him the failure of the enterprise. Moreover, he was, as we have previously mentioned, distinctly implicated in the missions of Guy Fawkes to Flanders and of Baynham to the Pope. Equivocation upon equivocation-lie upon lie-and to such he confessedly resorted throughout his examinations-will not help him in the face of such facts as these. Such facts are consistent with his being a willing, consenting, and approving confederate, the arch patron and sustainer of the bloody design, and many of them can be accounted for on no other supposition. "Indeed," says Mr. Jardine, " this conclusion appears to be so inevitable, upon a deliberate review of the details of the conspiracy and of the power and influence of the Jesuits at that period, that the doubt and discussion which have occasionally prevailed during two centuries respecting it can only have arisen from the imperfect publication of the facts, and, above all, from the circumstance that the subject has usually been treated in the spirit of political or religious controversy, and not as a question of mere historical criticism." If we remember the 5th of November in this way, by recallingwhatCatholiclaymen and even gentlemnen could contemplate as a meritorious action under the corrupting influence of such preceptors, let us not forget that the same day is the anniversary of a nobler effort, when Catholic and Protestant laymen, side by side on the slopes of Inkermann, suppressed a bloodier conspiracy against the liberties of the world.

THE SANITARY C6ONDITIOZT OF THE CLTY OF LONDON. TTTH NINTh ANNTTAT. REPf)lTh Dr. LEmIEBY, the Medical Officer of Health of the City of London, recently presented the following report to the commissioners - "To-day, Gentlemen, I bave to report you of the sanitaryesate of thecity duringthenlnthyear of myoffioe-the year which terrmlnatDdat Micheelmas last. "'And foremogt among the means which have been used for the pus. Pogoeof elucidating this are the weveral tables that relate tothe mor- tality for the year. These have been Prepared so asi to Ilustrato the tubject In arloua aspects. One Of theam exhibita the proportion of deaths in each of the city districts during the four seasons of the Year. Another informs ron of the death rate of the people at different gags, and gives you an account of the proportIon of deaths from each of the mostimportantidiseases. A third Indicates the compautive mortality in the city for tbelast nine yeaws; and the rest areexpressive of the influence of sex, occupation, and locality on the tenure of life. " At first you will observe thAt out of the city population of nearly 130,000 suls there died in the course of the erotc 9004 ersons, Ttis i, at the rate of 221 per 1,000 of the Inhabitants., or it Is one death among eTery 45 of the living. With one eiroeption. this la the sLmallest proper. tioanof deatha upon reoDrd. It is just 9 per cent. less than the general average, and It repreeentsa saving of 266 lives in the courre of the year. Ifo doubt can be raised as bo the cause ofihtb, for, on looking back over the death rol of the city forethe last nineyeaws, the time during which your sanitauy moeasures have been in op,eratloo, there wiLl be ,een a gradual falling off in the proportioyn of deathis, sintli from a yearly mortality of 3,763 it hoA been reducoed to 2,904. This Is a great result, and it will appear stilt. greater when you notice that it has been chefly effected in one distrlet-namely, the central. There tho Ionprovement has kcen to the extent of 13 per cenLt, above the general Average, and in some plseca it has reached to 38 per cent. In the westem divoisio of the city it has not beon greter than 7 perc coot., and in the eastern it has been only 3 per cant. This tells us that there are some places where the mortality Is yet high ; whlere, in fact, a cloud of deakth is always hanging, where the vitiality of the people Is slowly sapped, and where dimease mnakes easy conquest. It is not eneugh that these place are the continual haunts Of such endemic Maladies aSW phthisls, fover,and the other putrid classes, but often they become the samts of stronger pestilence. There it is the powers of sanitary science musat be 7zealously applied, fog it ig there the very dirt ferments and the air becomes envenomed ; and yet it Is rtill a question how these powers are to be appileKd, form cst of the denizrens of thes plague-nesis hare nio more instinct for self improvement than the unreasoning brute. If to-day You give them the appliance for cleanlinem and ordinary decency, to-morrow 7en Will find they have abawed them ; and nothing can be mere disheartening than the ill Mucesan Of all Your efforts to improve the character of these dismaI dens. And yet these efforts must stulbe used, and pmelrsevrigly; for, had as is the phjlcati stale of thes places, their mural state is worse, and children grow up to perpetuate the vioss which Ignorance has made theM love. That which is wanted. therefore, is some means of touching the root of these evils, of teachbing the Poor how to value the comforts of a deoent cleanl,y home, of educating them In& aproper spisit of Independence, and of making them know how gret is their power of helping themselves When this is done thle labours of saitary science Wil be com. paatively easy, for then the filthy habits, the wretched sQualor, ad th still worse moral vileness Will quicklY disappear. It does not fall within my Province to discuss the moans of education whereby this may bo accomplIashd, but I cannot hemD raying that there seems to me tobe an easy mode of doing It. Batseup but a fewbhousesthat are well odapted for the necessities of the poor, und you will won find that they are a strong incentive to the iormisg Of better habitt, and to the seeking for better homes. The spirit of Improvement which has led to the destruction of the poor man's haunts has had hut little re gsrd to the poor man's wants; and, after all, the majcaty of a groat city may be bet the glitterlr. diadem upon the front of desth, " If It be a saatisfaction to know that there atseother place in a yst wors condition than this Is, I can tell you that the mortalty of the whole city is much lets than that of the averge of large towns. Here the mortality isat therateot 22l per l,000of the living, and in the generality Of such places it Insas high as 25,26. Even in all Eng- land it Is at the rate of 22,8 per 1,000. But this ought not to lull us Into the belief that we have reached the highest point of sanitary roile, for these numbers have but a doubtful sIgnificatIon, In sDom pairts of the city thte death rate mounts to 27 per 1,Of0; and I should ill perform MY duty If I masked this fact or left it without a comiment. "And now le. us see 'What has been the Influence of age on the city mortality, and what the propoetton of deaths att each of the several ePochs of life. 'You will notice in the second table that of the 2,914 deaths for the year 1,163 occurred among infants of less than 5 years of age, 103 between the ages of S and 20, 1091 between 20 anid 40, 822 between 40 and 60, 540 between 60 and 00, and only 80 after the fifth epoch of life. Of 1,000 Persons, therefore, who died last year in the city 400 did not reach the fifth year of their age 466 died before reaching the 20th year, 601 before the third epoch, 711 before the 4th, 070 before the fifth, and only 30 were left to siruggle on to the sixth epoch. As In the vision Of MI=z, therefore, 'we may See the bridge of human life, with its hundred arches that span the city ; we can also see mnultitudes of people struggling to paa_, over it ; and as we look more attentively we may see the passenger, dropping through the traps and pitfalls of the bridge Into the great tide that flows beneath, But faster than In the dream of MaisrZ is the falling through of the crowd that struggles to pars over, for thicker and closer are the hidden traps and Pitfalls that beset the way. of the thousands who emerge from the dark cloud that hangs aboUt the bridge's entrance only one or two will reach the hundredth arch ; more than a third of them wil have droPPed throughi before they have traversed the twentieth part of the way ; more than half before they, have Rot to the crown of the thirtieth arch; and by the time Ins remn ant of the crowd has omeahed to the mniddle of tbs bridge there will be but three-tenths of a.l1 the number tottering on. in the fourtha table of the appendix IL have endeavoured to rePreset these facts more clearly than I can describe them. There you will woe that the mortality of Young ohidran is eas high as 416 per 1,000 of all the deaths, or 9Sper 1,000of the livn, In the WestLoDudon Union it is 363pW 1,OiO of the deaths, or , )I per Looo of the living ; and In the City Unionit is 327 per 1,000 of the deaths, or 665ofthe lrivig. Inall England it is 3iS perl,000 of the deaths, or 7316 Per LOD0 of the living; and in Fbanc it insust lOper31,000of theliving. The Proportion of deaths at other ages is shown in the fifth table of the appendix, and the general results are thAt in all cases except from 10 to 35 year, of ag the Droportion of deaths In the city Is maush larger than in the reet of Englad. Between thowe ages the advantages are greatly in favour of a clty life. "As to the influence Of OccuPation on the mortality, I may remind you of what was said In my last report, for the experlience Of another yea has Only confirmed the former obeservatious. Taking the mortality of the two) years, the following are the resutst :-of all the males at 20 years of age and UPWard,e in the city of Londoni the deaths per 1,000 are 22-fl, but the different classes Of society haveocontributed very unequally to the aggegate ; for butchers, poulterers and fishmnongers, shophkeeperg anid mercanstst bhave died at the rate of only from 15to16 in the 1,0O;DO ta w ile ors ad weavers shoemkaers, priaters and eamporitore have succumbed at the cats of from 20 to 23 per 1,000 ; wine-merchants, publipantf, and waiters, porters and meossengers at the cats of from 24 to 26 per 1,000 ; blackexmiths and gasftters painters and glasers, dyers, bargemen, and watermen at from 28 to 30 in the 1,000 ; cabmeu, draymen, cetlers -aren, and sftablekeepers at the rate of 31 in the 1.000 ; clerks and needlew0inen at from 34 to 35 in the 1,000; aLnd, lartly, the hard-work. tag Classes Of Carpenters, masons, and labourers at from 43 to 45 in the 1.000. These figures maay not be expressive of the exact influence Of the occupations On the mortality of the several classes, because3 it is 1mPoadble to eliminate all sources of error, hut they represent nearly enuogh the genral fact that there is a great difference In the vitality of the several classes, for the well fed butcher and the prosperous merchant die in far less proportion) than do those who are more ex posed to thLe rough usages of life;- anid then again there resins to be something about the ClOse occupation of clerks and nee-Ilewomen that makes them especially sasoeptible of diseas. I f we turn to the ether modes of testing this matter we shall find that, whlie In aU London the moan age at death among adult males Is a little less than it years, each class has Its own particular longevity. The merchant, Shopkeeper, and domestic sexrant, will live to be nearly 57 yrears of age ; the butcher, poulterer, anid fishmonger, to be about 03, Mosi.of the other classe will reach totheaWeOf from sqtoi52 thoutgh the painter and dyer, the oosetrmonger and hawker, the bargeman and waterman, survive only from 48 to 49 ; and lastly, the printer and compositor live to but 45, and the baker and confectioner to on'y 42. Among females the differences of occupation are not so sisiking except in the cas of the wives of cabmen and publicans, whero insteedi of living to the meanuageuof 56 tleYdie at 49, and the poor nje-de wOma3n sinks into the grave at the average age of 40. " The mean age at death of adult males in the citY is 61 aud of femaloesis; In al EnglandIt is 60and 61 ;eo that in one cmsabout 9 years is taken from the lifetime, and In the other about 6. And agadin, if we exemlue the longevity of adults at other ages it will he 8 ren that the contrast is squally great. At 45 and upwards the mean age at deathL of the male citizen. is 62, and of the female 65. In nil England it is68and 69. Attheage of 65a man mayexpect tolive to the 72d year and a woman to the 75th. but in the whole of iEngand the expectancy is to the 76th and the 77th, Thes are the numerical exponents of the strai upon a city life, and they testify o1 the penalties thait are paid to exoesalve civfiliztion. 'The records of the lastnine yegas tell us of the disoase whiebb ave contributed to thre results. There it is written that of every 1,000 deaths consumption has been fatal in 212, fever in 46, others of the rYmotic class in 125, diairchesa in 40, convulsions and teething in ss, and pneumonia and bronchits in 181. As usual, the three city unions have furnished erTy unequal prOPortions. The EAst London Union has been mOst Prolific Of cymotic msatadies in the proportion of 225 to 168, which Is the amount of the omtrat city district. In the Western Union consumption has killed 247 of the 1.000, and In the city only 191 ; and, lfastly, bronchitis and Pueumonla have been fatal in 174 case. Per 1.,0 In the eastern district, and only 239 in the centraL As compared with Enrgland, the chief differences In the causes of death aro the amount Of tubercular diseaesoN eIspecially Of infants; for while tahoe scrofula, and hydrocephailus are fatal with us to the extent of 9 un UK00in aU England the number is but 36 in 1,000. NO,, as these dtisaes are mostly occasioned by domegtlo vices, it may be sad that one of the great causes of tke high mortailty, of children in the city of rondon is the unwholesome tstte of their homes This I have endeavoured to iltlustrate In the eighth table of the appendix, where I have classified the deaths from different dieases under the heads of the several trades. P7bm that table It would aPPear that each clams of personis had its own prevailing malasdy. Phthisis seems to be the chief disease of Reediewomen, printers bakers cabmen, end policemen. FeOVer Prevails most amnong domeetic Servants, needliewomen, and oshmen; bronchitis and pneu. -or,la among labourers, P3inters, butchem costrmoriogers and hawkers; brain diseeses among porters, publicans, watermen, and bargemen; and liverdiseasessare the espeial attribute of the publicans. There is a aignifianco in all this, for It points ro the peculiar habits of the different clases, and indicates how much might be effected bh prudence and sotfoontroL 1' And now It is time that I should Inform you of what has beeu done In the course of the year for the purpose of Improving the pubUc health. Your inspsetors have funished me with returns of the sBtte of 6,294 houres, and 2,131 orders have been issued for various sanitry7 improvements. I have also received from your inspectors detaUed accoumts of the state of 4,718 rooms, each of which has been carefully measured and circomeatntLutly deecribed in respect oe its clesnlin3ess, state of repair, rental, and the number and oondition of Itsoooupaut, Ihave thus obtained a body of information which will, I trust, enable me to meet some of the untoward circunmtances to which I have so frequently alluded. These rooms were tenanted by 3,765 faml}ies, consng of 3,413 males, 3,677 females, and 6,187 chUdren ; In al, 13,277 persons. In 126 of these rooms I have found 624 persons-namely, 187 men, 244 women, and 193 children. Already I have described the manner In which thee Ieople have been distri. buted. In 47 cses3 there were two women and one man with three children iiving in the same room, In 10 cases three women and one man, and S cases of four women and one man. In 21 oawse there were two men and eno woman, 27 of two men and two women, 4 of two men and three women, 3 of three men and one woman, I of two men and four women, and 1 of three men and tbree women. I have not complicated this general summary by giving you an accmunt of the nunrber of chUidren in each of the rooms, but It has been a rare case not to find one or more. COrticitoeshave been Issmedot the overcrowding of these rooms, acd I hope soon to have them al regstered upon your books as common lodgisghouse. When this Ls accomplished, and your inspector of lodginghouse is appointed, you Fill have the means, through the pa'utary pow of your &ct of 1851, of puttinga scheckon hetaw lW some practioe of such place. " Among other sanitaW improvements during the yr has been thep abating of a number of trcde nuIsances; sod exoept in two eas, thlgi has alwaya een scOGOpllPbd sithout interfering with the progrem aC ndumtry or the conoerrs of commerce Th, indeed. has aWs, bee, my aim; for it In impoesible to disregard the fact that the wealth and commercial importance of this LretdcityhaVe ben mainly derTbd from. a free and unfetterod exerciee ot trade, and it wouldee rashnes to wuhe functions of my Office in Euch a way as to put aun nnoearycheckc upon Its progres Thoese who inaline thatthe SAiy condiUon f ibe country would be improved by ameddle om ntaerfercoo with the In dustria operations of it have taken a very lLmited sad * ve y i_ chievous view of the great caIue Of the eviltbey would remedy. The. high mortality of Iare towns and the frequst sprea or e md, dhess are caused not so much bythe unrestricted exercie od tiae. as by the habit of thpeople. The mischief lies not o much in thi workshop as in toe workmau' home, sud I would ratber ralse the vitality of the people to a standw1 ot health that will enable tbeh to resist the offensive influences o trade than I wouldlowertheenergle ot commerce to meet the exigenc'es of e loW vit3ity. Where would have been the now flourishing tradee ot BirmingbAm and Mancheser and Sheffield, and the hundred other busy oentres of indutry, whoam oommeros bas made LEWJand what she ie, if tbose trades bad been harassed by a mischievous sentimentalism and fettered by the fanttiC roles of a visionar system ot hygiene? In fact, the hIstoy of manu. factours in this country is not merely a history of the suoorful appUl. tionof scienee to artandof theprofitable employmentotwa%W products. Dor isit a hidory of the development of industry through the fostering eare of a paternal Government, for happily for us they have had no Ruch sasiance. It is rather a history ot the progres ot unfetterod enterprise, of the way ffi which competitive sBk has advwoed trade to the highest pitch of exoeUenoe. And, after al, where Ii the proof that this unoontrolled liberty of action has had any Iinjuious influence on the public healtht Early records Iform us thatthe Ufetime ofthepeoplehasnererbeenoIongaslItisnow. InI6l0,accerdingto Mi. Finlaison, the expectancy of a mans life at the age of 30 was only to about 66; at the present time it is to 63. Surelyths3 doeo not; show that the rapid progress ot manufactures has done any injury to the publio health; It ratber shows that with the increase ot trade and the larger employment o dtunatry there have oome better sean for the preservation of health snd the prolongatlon ot life. I am far from saying all thi3 that there are no ocoasions for interference with the methods of trade and manufaeture It =ay be that this very freedom in the exercise of industry when uncontrolled by acience does sometimes produoe what maybe caUed sn exuberance of growth that requires trimming and keeping in order. Here it is that the power of local authorities can be usefully employed; for when a manufacturer so onducts his processes u to let loose into the air and soll a large portion of his property *a waste products. he in not merely dolno an Injury to his nelghboumr but he is aso acting imprudently agabist his own interoeta; in fact, to asow property to paw from the domain of art Into that of nature Is to lose oommand over it5 That which has been done, therefore, to the city hm been merely the checking of waste and the suggesting of better modez for the manage. ment ot business, A word or two more snd I shall have done. In the oure of the year the medical officers ot the city unions have attended 14,046 cases cf disease among the poor. Of these, 1,093 were cases of ferer; 1,43 of diarrhoea. and 48 of English cholera Each of these 2,681 cases has been separately inquhied into, and many of the sanitary Orders ha1e had reference to them. "It might, perhaps, be thought that atthis jenetora of as expected visitation of cholera, I ought to report to you of the stae of ourdefenoe and of the manner in hich an attack isto be met. I do noe, howerer, think tht the signs of Itl approach are eufliciently clear to caU for any unnoeesary alarm or excitement of the publi mind, and even if they were I do not know that I could Dut the defences Into a better condition. It may be that these defences are not In an impregnable state, but I trnst that the sanitary mesures which have been enforoed for the last nine Jfere wil serve to fortify as Etrongly as possible against the approach of the maisdy. To all I would say that the most powerful means of repelUng the dlsease are prudence aud cleanUness Avoid all thouse rcmn. tauocez vvhch lower thevitat powers and remeve the putrid filth that gives the malady a hearty welcome. If I were to write an essay Ort the subject, I ooald tell you no more. One thing, however, I would foroeuDonthe attentIon of the parish authorities It i that they should be resdy for the appointment of a house to house vlsitaston. under the direction of their district medical officer, directly the first sIgns of the diease are with us, for experience hm shown that the dlarrhona which precedes an atta-k of cholera is mostly susoeptible ot cure.' The report was ordered to be printed and circulated among the members of the corporation. The Court. after transacting some ordinary business, adjourned.
THE INDIAN RELIEF FUND. PADDINGTON. A public meeting of the inhabitants of the parish of Pad' dington was held yesterday at the Vestry-hall, Harrow. road, for the purpose of ratsing a local contribution in aid of the above fend. The Rev. A. IL Campbell, Incumbent of the parish, took the chair. The Vestry Clerk read letters from Lord Ebrington, M'., and others, apologizing for their absence and expressing their approva of te objects of the meeting, Collections made In the varous places of worship in aicl of the fend wecre announced, amounting in the aggregate to The ROv. CIUIRsr.Mx briefly opened the proceedings, observing that whether we were properly in India or not, it; was a fact that we were there, and it was our duty to teach the natives of that country a leeson in charity and brotherly love by assisting those who needed our aid. (Hoar.) Mr. Churchwarden DIc SOuSo, in moving the first ereo. lution, explained that the cause of the delay in caUing this meeting was not any lukewarmness on the part of the residents in Paddington; but the fact was that many of the wealthier inhabitants had been out of town, and it was deemed expedlent to fLx a period when those persons could take an active part in any proceedings which should be adopted in the parish. The resolution ran as follows - E " That this meeting, deeply Impremed by the horrible eTens which. have occurred duoing the mutiny and rebellion in India, desire to expres their heartfelt sorrow for the souferinas of their Countrymen, their eympathies wita tho3e who mour the lose of these who have faUen victnms to the most relentlems cruelty and basest treachery, and their earnest prayer that, br the blesing of God opon our gllant troops, tranquility and order maybe speedly restored. Mr. Churchwarden EvA?Ns seconded the resolution, which. was unanimously ado ted. Mr. BAYLIS movod the second resolution, which statW! the necesasiy of raising local subscriptions in aid of the fund for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian mutiny, both civil and military. Mr. SiAWv seconded the resolution, urging that it was a matter of simple justice on the part of the people of Eng. land to endeavour to alleviate the necessities of those who had so nobly upheld the fame of England in the East. The resolution was then unanimously agreed to. A list of individual subscriptions were then announced exceeding in the whole 2001. Mr. Pxmsy moved and Mr. GUTCH seconded a resolutioa for the appointment of a committee to collect subscriptions which was unanimously agreed to. Sir B. HALL, M.P., proposed a vote of thauks to the chairman, and excused himself from addressing the meeting upon the main object for which it had been called unon the ground of a severe cold, fromthe effects of which he was visibly sulffering. Having addressed his constituents in a neighbouing parish upon a somewhat similar occasion there could be no doubt of his view s upon the matter. The Rev. Dr. BuR^Ss seconded the resolution, ancd earnestly hoped that a collection would be raised which wonld worthily represent the sympathy of the district. Whatever opinions might prevail respecting the cause of the outbreak, there could be none that it was our duty tor uphold our honest fame by contributing to the utmost of our power to relieve the wrants of our suffering countrymen. The resolution was then agreed to, and after a few words of acknowrlegment from the rev.chairman the meeting broke up. BURY ST. EDMUTNYS. The subscriptions in this town and neighbourhood have reached 8301. 2s. 9d., and the mayor has remitted that sum to the central committee. IPSWICH. The mayor has remitted a further sum of 2704 to the central committee, making in all a contribution of 1,0001. from the town and district. WESTON-SUPER-MARE. Mr. Kinglake, the treasurer, has forwarded to the Lord Mayor of London the sum of 3101. for the relief of the sufferers in India. FARNEA?M At a meeting held in this town in which the Rev. J. S.' IJtterton, vicar of the parish, took a leading part, it was resolved to raise a subscription in aid of the Fund for the Relief of the Sufferers by the Indian Mutinies. The coUllections already amount to 3201. EDINBURGIL The subscriptions here have now beoo reported as amounting to 14,6491., including the sum of 5241. coUected at the established churches of Edinburgh and vicinity on the Fast. day. A letter has been received from the Lord Mayor oE London expressing the satisfaction of the London comi mittee at the course proposed by the Edinburgh committee in reserving the right of distribution both in London and Edinburgh, as well as in India. The secretary reported to the committee on Monday that he had written to the se. cretary to the fund in London on the subject of the question propounded by the Committee of the General As. sembly regarding relief to the widows and orphans of soldiers, and bad received an answer to the effect that the wirdows and orphans of soldiers who might die in the service, and the wives and children of those disabled by the casualties of war or of climate, would be regarded as the most proper objects of relief from the fund.
