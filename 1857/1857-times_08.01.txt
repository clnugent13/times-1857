SECOND EDITION. _~~~~~~~~ .- . THB f TIMZSOFppB, &twday Motinz4 EXPRESS FROM PARIS: Was foowng is the letter of our Pam co1eependen, dated staterday (Friday), 6 p.m.:-. it is eerhin tlut Oolonel Barmann, for severa yeas past biifte Plentpoteniary o£ the Helvetic (onfedeti4r Paiis, has given in his resignation, ana that his decision is announced as irrevocable In laummy %t IL Barranau proceeded to Berne for the same purpose, and it required aln thl eloquence! of the Precdlnt of the eFaI Council and th] entreaties ot acme of th leading. members of tha body to make him'change- his purpose. Ther Waa, I beliee one coniidexstion more powerful than ayr: other with A. Barmnn, and that was the unpleasant state of the negotiation then - pending between Switzerlad and z Prusia, and'thb doubts as to a pacific solution of the NeucMt question. All delicacy on that score now no longer exists, and Colonel Barmann who, It is believed has not been treated with the Justice to whioh hi" servlces entitled him, has seen no course left hiim but to rign a post which he has long filled to,his credit. It is stated in the Ruslahm paper, the Nord, that the Emperor of the French ever evincede.a decided preference for Dr. Kere, who came here on a specialsmiion concernring the Neoheitel quesdion, and who, by the way, very nearly spoiled it at the very outeet. The N.ord takes every' oppoatnity--of course in an underbandrnsner-of gratifying its sarcti irit in its alluaion to the Emperor and the lmperial Court. Ito attempt to hold up to ridicule the priate amnaements of Villeneuve 'Etang is not yet fOrgtten or forgiven, and the preference it attributes .to the Emperor in the present intance is pretty mnuc. in the same style. But, ironical er serious, the Ftatement is totally inconsiatent 'ith the fact. Ce :Emperor has not forgotten ithe inds crotion oo use the grutleat term) about the King of Prujssias confideu*al letter, nor the rather free criticismof Dr. Keft on His Pruian Majestja parts of sfeech, which we all thovght Frederick William wmlcd have minsie an additimmal casus bel with the Venfederatiou. These wreo not the only blundes q#id to be csan'mitted by 'the Plenipoteaiary, who ,was yet youqg in his dipinatic career. 'he fact is, there are wertain exigescies in the Swis Chambers whichtheCovernment Ibas notthemnvalcourage or the meansito resist, audhence theresignation of CoL Barmann. 'he retirent of the latePlenipotentiazy of the usnfederatiosi is regretted iby all his colleagues, rimcludingi-e Prusian Minister himself, at wel at by vll whe dmad the advantge of beingaquaintell with him. M. -de Perigi, who ad cowne over to atte*d the funeral of kis father-in-lsa the Prince do'ie Moakeow, left lot night on his rturn to Lon&en. He will atteid lae Emperor omr- is visit to Osbean.

'The French Co=sul at CGvro made a complaint to the zilover-nor against one of the leading mechnt of thie place, n1ame Effendi Moballa, as the ,Frin- q.lcause of the refuasi of the people .ad the uneasiness which followed the attempt to abciaBh the calendar. Effeudi Mohalla wasI sur moned before the Governor, He denied that ze had promoted the indignetion of the people, though be prticipated inl it, and that he as prell as 4hey were determined to chide by their old ustoms. The Governor dismissed IinM in peace. It was still hoped that the oench Goverament woud give instructions to its Consuls And other Agents to refrain from meddling lh Greek hagiologies or calendars, and to allow tbVe inhabitants to retain their fesativals as they think proper, and abova all that peremptorg orders wrould 'be given to the Ctonsul at Alexandria to allovr the church whieh ~he had caused to be shut up to be again opened, and to have the priest whom he caused to be exiled to be restored to liberty and ti? the unrestricted-exercise of his religious duties.

I do not think that your lordships wish iue to follow the noble earl in those details; I think that I, who have no pretension to any great military knowledge, would simply be making myself ridiculous hy attempting to do so; and I must say that I attach even leas liportance than I was Inclined to attach to the obhervatious of the noble earl on this subject a few days ago, whell he Went into, military details to which it was utterly impossibLe for me or any one of your lordships, ar, indeed, any person whatever to give an answer, for I End that some of tha principal sa*tementa then made by tba noble earl have since by the comimunications msde by percons not in England, but on the spot, received a moa distinct and positive negative. (Lond cbporu) And I do think it is most extraordiary that the noble earl, who speaks with a1 that authority to which hbi knowledge and experince entitle him, should be so anxious to criticizs he conduct of the Government in India, and should come down hero night after night for the: purpose of entering nto disoussions on thooe very points on whlch we have no Information, and eta which it is imposdiblefor the noble earl himself to have any elhable information. (Loud chees) The noble earl bas this evening. core down with thzt intention, alhough on this very evening we expeot to receive by mail more ample informaftion; and if it does not throw the whole. of the light that might be given it will, at all events, throw ome lighl on this question. The noble earl baa studied military questions, ,aud I, theiefore, who a An ordinary civlian, do not choose to'expose myself by speaking on uilita details. About a -year ao, duing a conversation whiclir had withlfrt. Matculay, lhe pointedout to me a passage with which, perhaps, I ought not to trouble your lordships, but I rosly tLiiik It does apply in some degree to dicusuloes of.this detailed character in this Houte upon Iacth !tb iQU seitted, Th se occu lzihe seth delivered by Lacius A.1nlins te RQoels eanate, at a momeznt when military operatioul wee being curTid-on abrod.

The noble earl sat down, not only without giving his moral support to the Government (heat, hear), but concluded his speech, in which he displayed Lim powers to the utmost, ad which we know win prepdred, for he gave us notie of it, by -ying that' he haz no confidence In the Indiax Government. Why doss not the noble eal move for a. chsage in ihat Government? If we had a more numerous attendanoe of peers, or if we oDlOd have anticiptaed the delivery of such a speech as we bave heard to-night, I would undoubtedly have move as an a-endment to the motion before your lordship, that this Houe has onfidence in, and is ready ti uppOrt the Government of India. (Hear.) If it goes out to luidia and to the world that the Geerals and civilians to whom the management of affairs is intrusted have not the confidenoe of those in this tountry who see themielves up as great authorities on Indian sabjects, the greatest mischief is ikely to ensue. (Hear, hear.) The noble earl ventures upon a discusudon of details about which he confesses that he known very little, and which he founds merely upon a telegraphio report that a oertain regiment had been diamed instead of disbanded. For all that we are awae of to the contrary, there might have been very sufficient rewsr for disarming this regtment, and the noble tarl was himself compelled to admit thst the nature of the emergency may have rendered such a step advisabie. If the noble earl can place no reliance on those by 'chom affairs are conducted in this great crisis, it is unquestionably his risht ud his dniv to say u. But it. is neitier his duty nor his right to thxrow distrut on the Government of India without testing the real feeling of your lordshpr on that sabject. It is only due to those wbo occupy positions of great responsibility in India that nxothing should be done -to weaken their power and authoxity as long As they hold onerous official situations.. (Hear, hear.) 1y lords, I have s3yssif given notice of a nuestlon connected wth the Indian Government which I wisli to put to Her Maesty's Government. At the presenxt moment the India Government is crippled byv set of per.fectly absurd regulation Those ragulatioss te to teb civil service of the 1as India Company. Provision is made by an Act of Parliaunent for sending out. noon certain reports from the Govemnor-General, indiidati to supply vacancies in the civil service to a limited extent; sai regulations are Ade by the Board of Control, by which the Indian Govefornent is bound and fettered. I canot e ly uy whst thoes regulations and instructions are; butit is well knowf that the civil service ha long been inadequate to, supply the wants of its own branch of the administration, and that It has been necessary to sup plement ifby drawing ay a great number of of ficers from their regiments in orer to pl cethem in civil employment. No doubt, many of these officers have been spoilt for nilitary duties by having been thus tusnedinto civiians. StiU, a certain proiortioa of them rould surely be found usefau in the presens emerencyif restored to their mente. I thereFore w.ish to have an assurnce that if these otficers are sent back to the army the Governor-General sholl not be prevented by any neiwork of foolish regulations from supplying their plaoes in the eivl departments by any elas of men whom he can find in the country. There is a lae available popuation of Europeans, East Indians, ,natives of India, who ae well qaifed for emoloyment nnder the Government; and the Governor-General ougbt to be at liberty, irrespective of any regulations as to the covenanted or uncovenanted service, to appoint these men, at leas provisionally; to ammy civil situationl in which he may think thej'wousld prove usful (H{ear, hear.) My lords, I will On]J addtat if I'arllaxncnt have not conzfldeneein our present Indian aministtors the sooner it subtiutes for them poersons in whom It has confide-nc tho better it will be boh for thiis country ad for Idia (Hear.) The Earl of MALKESBURY.-I did not expect from the noble marquis,the hacldseyed reproof, so often giyento this side of the HWonse wrhen we differ from Her Majesty's Government, and. exprnsaometblig like a want of c6nfideuce In their exertions and their opinions,-vis., that we ought to bringforward a votoeof eansure upon the nistry and ehallenge the' House to a division.

HOUSE OF cMAMONS, FRnAY, JuLY 31. The Sz&Amam took the chair shortly after 12 o'clock. ELECTION COMMITTEES. Mr. '. BAILTIE inquired whether it was the intentior of the Government to order the Attorney-General to prose cute all the persons reported to the House by election com Suittees as having violated the laws o: the country, b whaether the proseoutions were to be confined to the case ot the persons reported against by the Mayo (coanty' Elee tion Committee! P Sir G. GREY believed tho ordinary practice to be tha the Attorney-General was ordered to prosecute on th motion of the chairmen of election committeei; if it wer the opinon of the committees that what had taken plac justified sacha proceeding. In' the Mayo case, the chaii man of the electioa committee, with, he understood, th, coneurrence of the committee, made a motion for the prose cution of two lndlviduals and if the chairmen of othe election committees should make similar motions, th louse, doubtless, would deal with each case according to it Iaerits. PIROBATE AND LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATI02 (IRELAND) BILL. On the motion that the House resolve into committee or this Bill pro forn42, for the purpose of enabling certab amendments to be made, Mr. M'MAON expressed a hope that all the provision Telating to real estate would ultimately be struck out of thi ill. The Bil was then committed, and several amendment were made. REVISING BAIRRISTERS (DUBLIN) BILL Mr. J. FITZGER&LD moved that the House resolv Into committee on this BilL Mr. NAPIER moved an amendment to the effect that th Bill be committed that day month. The obiect of th Bill, he said, was to get a new set of revising barlsters fo 3)ublin, in the plaee of others wvho had for five or Six year performed their daty ably, and had the advantage of expe xience in their office. He maintained that the present r vising barristers had a right to their offices during goo4 lbehavioar. He objected to vest, as the Bill propose th appointment of the revising barristers of Dui in th lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, as it was natural to suppos that the Government woald desire the registration to be a favourable to them as possible, especially as a son of th Lord Chancellor of Ireland had been an unsuccessfal can didate at the last election. Mr. J. FII'ZGERALD contended that the gentlemen t whom the right hon. and learned member for the Univerdt of Dublin alluded were no longer In the position of revisin barriaters, as the individual who appointed them (1h Cbairmn of the Court of Sessions of Dublin), ana th office in virtue of which the appointment was made, ha, both cesed to exist. Under these ircumstances, the Lard Iieutensnt had, under an Act of 1851, appointed a gentle snar of 20 years' standing at the bar as revising barrister -andwhat wvas asked nowr was power to a ppoint another re vising barnister, as the business could not be got through b; ene in the allotted time. Mr. HARDY considered that the appointmeut of revisln, jarristers by. the Lord-Lteutenant of Erelasd was unconsi tutional, and tha. the appointment should Proceed as i3 EngLand, vwhere the judges selected the revisimg barrister from non-political persons. Of all places where revisln barristers should be appointed by non-political person Dbulin was the spot. (H ear, hear.) The best conrse t 3iursue would be to bring in a Bill to continue in office th three gentlemen who had hitherto discharged the function ef revising barristers InDablin, and to vest the appointmeen afterwards in the judges. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BUTT thought it undedrable that tha Lord-Liev tenant should have the power of appointing the revlsin barristers for Dublin, and would support any motion whicl xespecting the rights of the gentlemra who had recently beei appointed revising barrister by the' Lord-Lieutenant a Ireland, would in future place the appointment in the hand of the judges. Mr. WEITESIDE designated the Bill as a little job go Up between the resignation of the right hon. maember fo ltroud and the appointment of tho right hon. member fo the county of Kerry. The object of the Bill was to confirc to the Lord-Lieutenaut of Ireland the right of givingaa one office, which appeared to be doubtful, and to confe eonhim the right of giving away another office. (Hear hear.) The hon. and learned gentleman concluded by ob serving that a great number of legal appotatments had bee, conferred of late on Roman Catholics. and that he did no 7nderstand why the respectable gentlemen, who hap ue to be Protestants, and who had ably aischarged the detif of revising barristers in Dablin for thelast five or six yea s-hould be turned out of office before they died. Sir G. GREBY observed that the gentlemen referred to b the hon. and learned membor for Enniskillen had ceased t have any authority to perform the duties in question, an consequently the Lord-Lieutenant of Irelandhadmadea appointment tq the office under the Act of 1851, but as tb naumber of claims to be decided on were so numerous tih Lo one persor 'could get through the revision in the tim presoribed by law, the proposition now made was that th Lord-Lieatenant of IrenOld should have power to appoint second Person to assist ina that duty. The appointments c the Lord-Lieuteniant had been impgned by the hon. an learned member, but he believedL that iMs noble fren.d th lord Lieutenatt and the righ hon. genttleman latelyv at tb Lead of the office of Chief iecretary for Ireland were oul Actuated by the single desire to promote the interests of tb blic service in the apioontments they made. (Hear.)] th"ed HOuse sbeuld thrik that the appointment sheuld placed in the hands of the Lora chief Juice of Ireland is stead of the Lord-Lieutenat, that was a matter to b decidedin comiittee, but such a ourse of proceeding woul be inconsistentr with the principle eatab% sedineand 'where the Lord-Lientenantappointed the assistant barrist Jy whom the electoral lists were revised. -Mr.-WHAHON Said that the sYstem under which th :revising baristers werde apaptoinrted inEnla lnd did noti giv satisaction, nepotism prevailing to a great extent. I 'would be bet4er in Ireland for the Lord-Lientena-at to hay the appointmen!i of revising barristers than the Jud-'s After some fsther discussion, the House divided, whe For the amendment . .. ... ... 57 Against it . . 90 Majority for.-33 The "ouse accordingly resolved into committee on th Bill. On the first clause, 'Mr. NALPIliRproposed an amendmenot to the effect the the Lord Chief Justice of Irelandi should have the appoinil Dent under the pill, instead of the Lord.Lieut,nant. Mr. BUT r sugested that the aPPOintment should b vested in the theree chief justices, whoe conurrence woul be a -eurity agarinst improper appointments. Mr. EILDYARD sunported the aaendment. Notwitl Mranding what had been -stated respecting the feeling whie, led to t e appointment of revising barister in this countr3 LOmaintained that a proof that these gentlemen had pei 1formned their duty, well was to be founid in the binsgnifican number of appeals brought againt ther decision. The amendment was supported by Mr. Whiteside, Mi 3enley, and Colonel French, and opposed by M1r. B faerbert, Mr. Green, and Mr. J. Fitrgerjld.

The committee had further agreed to the following resolution:- "That it was proved that two voters were bribed by Pierce and Butcher ; cnd that John Wells was bribed by b Arthur Cobbold, with an agreement releasing him from the 3 payment of rent, but that these acts of bribery were no, committed with the knowledge or consent of the sitting 3 member; that it appears from the evidence given before - the committee that the payments made to voters on account 5 of travelling expenses were systematically in excess of the - actual disbursements of such voters, but that it was not r conclusively proved to the committee that such payments 3 were made with corrupt intentions." HUNTINGDONSHIRE ELECTION. Mr. COBBETT informed the House that the committee r appointed to try the petition complajoing of an undua election and return for the county of Huntingdon had de. ! termined 'hat John Moyer Heathoote, Esq., was not duly x elected as a knight of the shire, and that Edward FelloweF, Esq., was duly elected. He had further to inform the Hon e sthat the committee had altered the poll taken at the election by striking off the names of certain voters. The hon. gentleman then moved that the Clerk of the Crown do attend the House on MConday with the last return for the county of Huntingdon, and amend the same by erasng the name of John Moyer Heathcote, Esq. The motion was agreed to. PARLIAMENTARY OATEHS. Lord J. RUSSELL gave notice that he would on Monday 3 next move that a select committee be appointed to conside: r whether the Act 5th and 6th of William IV., cap. 62, was s applicable to oaths appointed by law to be taken by mem. . bers of that House at the table previously to taking . their seats, and in what manner it so applied, and to report thereupon to the House. He would pro. a pose to name 25 members of the committeo, and thal e all gentlemen of the long robe should be members He wished to ask the noble lord at the head of the Govern. ment whether, as this question conoerned the seat of a member of that House, and as the committee would havi D but a short time for their inquiry, he would Alow the r motion precedence on Monday? s Lord PALMERSTON replied that although he was very 3 unwilling to assent to any oonrse which would delay the I business at presont before the House, he thought that under the circumstances he could hardlyrefuseto wc4edetobhi noble friend's request. (Hear, hear.) EDUCATION. r Sir J. PAKINGTON said he wished to move an address to the Crown for the appointment of a commission of inI quiry on the subject of education, and as he believod the ; proposal would not be opposed by the Government, and the a discussion was therefore likely to occupy a very short time, he begged to ask whether the noble lord at the head of the Government would afford him an opportunity of bringing forward the motion on an early day--say Thursday or Fri s day next? I Lord PALMERSTON would consult his collegaes, and would answer the question of the right hon. gentleman in the course of the evening, I IRISH EX OFFICIO POOR LAW GUARDIANS. I Mr. M ACARTNEY asked the Chief Sretary for Ireland f whether the Poor LAw Commissioners for Ireland had oome s to any decision as to the legality or illegality of a paid officer of a union, aud appointed a magistrate, and thereby becom. ing an ex ofcio guardian, taking part in the proceedings r anu voting on questions affecting hls conduct and remunerar tion; and whether there waS any objection to laying on the table a copy of the correspondence between the Midleton r Board of Guardis and the Poor Law Commissioners upon r the rght of Dr. Barry to vote as an e offico guardian, he being one of the paid of ficers of the union?s Mr. H. HERBERT aid, the fir uestqon put by his honfriend had not actually been raised beforo the Poor Law t Commissioners In Ireland as regarded officers of unions I generally, but a question had been raised with regard to s the election of the doctor of a dispensary district whether, I be ng a -magte (as we understood) heha a right to sit as e offcio guardian. The PoorLaw Commissioners gave it as r their opiion that he was leygall entitled to sit as a o guardian, but as a matter of propriety and decorum they a suggested that he should abstain from voting on question, a affecting his own dispensary or salay, With reference to e the second question put by his hon. friend, there had been t no 0ommunication in which Dr. Barry was named at all. e An abstract question had been put by the dlerk of the e lidleton Union on the subject, and the hon. gentleman a might have a copy of the document if he thought it worth f his while to move for it. I TROOPS FOR THE RED RIVER. o hr. ADDERLEY asked the Under-Secretary for Wr f or what purpose troops had been aent to the Red f Sir J. RAbISDEN said the troops to which the hon. o gentleman had referred had been sent in order to replace a body of equal number whose term of serviOe expired rather a more than a year ago. d NOXIOUS TR&DE13 AND NUISANCES NEAr TED HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT. s Mr. ADDERLEY said the First Commissioner of Works had stated ou the previous day that by the Nuisanees Be. e mnoval Act there was no power to prevent the noxious e trades to which allusion was then made being carried on; and he wishod now to ask whether the effect of that Act was to repeal a previous one which gave ample power to suppress such nuisances? s Sir G. GREY said by the Act to which the hon. gentle man referred power was given to the Secretary of State to direct information to be laid against persons carrying on noxous trades within the limits of the metropolis, but there was an Act passed last stsion which, after reciting that e power, provided that no proceeding should be taken under the said Act agaist other nuisances than smoke, unless It should appear that the local authorities had fai1ed to. take proceedings for the suppression of such nuisances. He uderstood that the lOCal authorities concernred in the nuisances to which the hon. gentleman called the attention of the First Commissioner of Work on the previous even. 3i9 were the vestrY of Lambeth, and the First Commissioner had brught the subject under their notioe. MAIL CONTR&CT PACEETS. h Lord NAAS asked what steps had been taken by Govern. ment in pursuance of the report of the Committee on Contract Packets appoin,ted under tbe Treasury minute of the 1st of March, 1853; and wheher it was now contemrplated to grant an extension of say existing contracts, notwithstanding the modifications recommended in that report? Mr. WMhSON said the report to whioh the noble lord referred containedi a great number of recommendations, and one prgrph in 'It, hAving referene to the length of contrac for the postal service, pointed out the true principles on which theoriginal oontracts and the renewls of oontracts were made. He was not aware how far those niIncioles ha eerta .note ulm ost- f the s-;uc?s h~ad beonletfr a long period. Tho contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Company was for no les than eight years, and that with the R"yal West India Mail Company was for 11 years. 51 They had-no official proposal before the Tzeasury at present for the extension of any of those servies. Whenever they I might have any aueh appUication before them itwould be the I imne for themn to consider whe6ther it would be for thepublic advantage that any suh extensionashould take place. C-art tAiny on no other considerAtioxt would any extension take place ; but a ttie preset maoment they had no such application before thent. THE BRITISH SCHOONER MARIA. On the mnotion that the House at its rising adjourn till Monday, Mr. JOHN LOCKE proceeded to call the attention of the House to the seizure of the British oelsooner Maria in Venezaela, and to inquire whether the Government had received any atisffactory reply from Her Majesty's charg6 cZ'affaires at Caraccas on the subject. He said the schooner Miria, commanded by Captain Onseley, traded with satle betv'een Demerara and Venezuela, and It appeared that so far bh ck as the 17th of February, 1856, she, being then in ballat, was anchored at Camrcas, at the maouth of the Orinoe4o for tho purpose of loading with cattle and caryIng them .to Venezuela. When she was so anchored there, the Custom. houe officers came on board, and, finding that the vessel -,a shasply in ballast, proceeded to seize certain small artcle%f belonging to Captain Ouseley, cond4ting of tweed, cottonj, and other things. They nsais e upon duty bKing paid, and fined him $100. Th V1cA-06 qpzij4yed . W asa breac bGOf the law on tho part of tho autheri,ties at Caraccas to fine Captain Ouseley $100 for ha%Xng no cargo when tho vessel was in. ballast. flowever that might be, the fine was paid and also the duty on the articles mentioned. The cholera was then raging at Ca.,ccas, and Captain Ousley determinedto go further up the river. Having anohored his vessel, he went on shore, in search of provisions, and took these articles with bh:,. His bat..wa boarded by a canoe, all the articlas were seized, and he was taken to Bolivar. He was thero pub in .a boat and taken dowvn the. river to where the Mr lay at anchor. The vesiel was seized and carried back to Bolivar. It was 'ncot until a decree 'Was obtained from the Court of Bolivar that the vessel was liberated, and when liberated the masts and rigging were found to have been destroyed. Captain Oase. ley was unable to fulfi his eontracts in Venezuela and Demerara, had been aompelled to employ a lawyer to get the decree, and haid been put to serious inconvenience and expenses for which be clmed as compensation the sum of 3,0001. Whether thatclaim was'in amount right or wronr was not for him, to decide, but Captain Ouseley wax justifiel in complaining of the charg6 d'affaires at Caraccas,. who from that time to this liad taken no Actice whatever of his representations, or of th'e remonstrasices of the vice-consuL It must be obvious to every one that it was only to those deputed by the Government that traders In such places could look for protection, and therefore it waa a case which imperatively demanded that the Government should call to account the charge d'affaires at Caraccas. THE INDIAN ARHIY. Sir J. PAKINGTON rose, in pursuance of notice, to alk the First Lord of the Treasury whether he would lay upon the table of the House the report made by the late IUente nant-General Sir C. Napier to the Dake of Wellington upon the organization of the Bengal army. Perhaps the House would for a moment think that the request had be mn already compiled with, as they had a paper which pur. ported to be an extract from the despatch of Sir C. Napier but he should be able to show them that th1 report for which the hon. and gallant member fo East Norfolk had asked, for which his right hon. iriend theimember for Bucldnghamshire had moved, and for which he now again inquired, was a distinct report, and not the zeport to which the noble lord at the head of the Goveramnent had referred an a report upon the external defenoes of India. Upon inquiry, after the statement of the noblg lord that the report referred only ineidentally to the organization of $he Bengal army, beinga report on the externa defences of India, he found that, although the report of vwich the noble lord spoke came to the Horse Guards, it was not made directly by Sir C. Napier to the Duke of Wellington, but was presented in the first instance to Lord Dalhousie, and forwarded by Lord Dalhonsie to the Horse Guards. The report presented to the House was written on ihe 27th of November, 1849, and in it Sir C. Napier said he would write upon. certain matters in " another letter.' It was to that other letter that all these inquiries had been'directed, and to that other letter the noble lord had not referred in any of the answers which he had given to the House. He was informed that it was written early in the yeat 1850, that It was a report of considerable length, that it adverted ins extenio to the organization of the Bengal army, to the state of that army, to the grievances of wnich the trcops complained, and to the remedy which Sir C. Niapier thought ought to be afforded. If he were correctly informed, the report went on toforetell the evils vhichwould inevitablyresult unlss the Government withaboldbanddealtvwith the conditionof the Bengal army. Hethought tleastitwasclearthatif theGovernmentobjected tothe produotion of that report it could not be for the reason assigned for not procducing the other-viz , that as it related to the external defences of India the public interest required that it should not be produced. The report which he now asked for had nothing to do with the external defences of Indua, but related exclusively to the condition of the Bengal army. He could not but think that at this moment of exciting interest areport of so important a character would be most acceptable to Parliament. HA therefore clled the noble lord's attention to what he conceived to be the misapprehension under which the noble lord had answered former Inquiries. He was sure the noble lord had not Intended to divert the attention of the House from one report to another, and he was convianed the noble lord was under some misapprehension with regard to this subeot. He wished to ask the noble lord whether he was rightly informed that such a report existed, and, if so, whether there would be any objectEon to lay it upon the table of the House ? (Hear, hear.) Lord PALMEBSTON stated, in answer to the questou of tha hon. member for Southwark, that as soon as Lor I Clarendon became aware of tbe circumstanoes to which ih ' hon. gentleman had referred he put himself in communication with;a oommissioner from Venezuela, who was then In England, but who was about to return to his own Country. Lord Clarendon stated to him what,he had heard, and urged him to bring the matter under the serious atteniionL of his Governmmentimmediatelyuponas return. Atthe 3ame time idstructions were given to Her fajjasWs Charge d'Affalres at Venezuela to take whatever steps he might think nesssary. Sufficient time had not yet elapsed to enable the Government to receive an answer to either of those commbnications, but he was sure that Lord Claren. don would &aopt such measures as the case might appear to require. (l(ear, hear.) With respect to the question of the rght hon. baronet opposite, the Houta would temsember that upon aformer oocaeion he stated that the report to which he understood the questions of the right hon. member for Enoks and the hon. and gallant member for Norfolk to refer was not a report made to the Dake of Wellington by Sir Charles Napier, but one addressed by the latter to the Marquis of Dalhousie, ot which a copy was sent in a private letter from Sir Charles Napler to the Duke of Wellington. At the same time he stated that that report did not relate to the organization of the Bengal amy, but referred generally to the external defenoes of India, msnse especially as connected with the reont acquisitions in tin Punjab. He told the House that ther were pssages in that reNlrt which did relate to the condition and disaciline of the Indian armies, and that he would lay those passages upon the table. That promise had been fulfilled; but the right hon. baronet now stated that the questions of the right hon. member for Bucks and the hon. and gallnt member for Norfolk related to another and a subsequent report, and in confirmation of that statement he had quoted one passage from the extracts which had been hlie on the table, in which Sir Charles Napier said that his observations upon certain matters mentioned in bis report would be maie in a subsequent letter. That letter the right hon. baronet thought must have been addressed to the Duke of Wellington and not to the Marquis of Dalhousie, and must have been written some time in 1850. It was more probable, howtevr, thaSt the letter, if written, was addressed to the Marquis of Dalhousie and not to the Duke of Wellington, because the first document was a report to the Go. vernor-General, and not to the Commander-in-Chief in England, with whom the Commander-in-Chief in India had no official connexion. He had now to state to the House that when the questions of the right hon, member for Bucks and the hon. and galant member for Norfolk were first put he made inquiries and was informed that the report to which his answer related and from which he had given extracts, was the only repoA found at the Horee Guards. After the stAtement of the right hon. baronet, however, he would make more minute inquiries, and if there was such a paper as that to which allusion had been made, and if it contained nothing more than what the right hon. baronet supposed, he was not aware that there would be any obiection to its production. (Hear, hear.) Mr. WHITESE calUed the attention of the House to the following pavsage in a commaunication addressed by Major-General Hearsey to the Deputy Adjutant-General of the Bengal army, and, dated Barraokpore, January 28, 1857:- 'I I beg leave to report for the information of Government that an ill-feeling is said to subsist in the minds of the Sepoys of the regiments at Barrackpore. A report has been spread by some designing p ersons, most likely Brabmins or agjents of the religious Hiindco party in Calcutta (I believe it is called the Dhurma Sobha), thaAt they (the Sepoys) are to be forced tc embrace the Christian faith." In the fourth paragraph of the same communication tile witer said:- "P erhaps those Hindoos who are opposed to the marriage of widows in Calcutta are using underhand means to thwart -Government in abolishing the restraints lately removed by law for the m a o£ widows, and conceive if they can make a party of t e ignorant classes in the ranks of the army beiieve their rell~on or religious prejudioes are eventualy to be abolished by fozoe, and by force they are all to be made Christians, and thus, by shaking their faith in Governmenet, lose the confidence of their officers by indudingBepoys to commit Offenco4 (such as incendiarism) so object.t put a stop to. or prove, they will gain their The hon. and learned gentleman then proeseded to say that he had been informed by a gentleman who had resided 15 yerzsin Calcatta that these statements of Major-GenerAl Hearsey were to tho last degree improbable. The society referred to in the first extract, he had told him, Contained some of the largest lan^Aded proprietors, the most distinguished literary persons, and the wealthiest native merchants 1U Calcutta, and it would be most unfortunate indeed if thoe powerful and infuential parties had really turned against us, in^^asmuch flaswe might find it very difficult to holdjthe country sagalust them. W hat MEajor-General Hear. sey doubtless referred to was a matter of some in portanca. It had been stated more than once on the part of the East India directors that they had pas6ed no law exceut one dealing with what they called the atrocioun practice of depriving a man converted to Christianity of his inheritance, and the Chairman had assured the House that no interference had taken place with castes-a point of great importanoe, be. cause it affected the opinions and actions of 100,000,000 of people. Lord Dalhoune had taken credit to himself for the pasesag of the law in question; but, according to the statements of the gentleman to whom he had already referred, that law had caused greater alarm and appreheansio over the whole territory belonging to the East India Company thea any other whioh had been enacted since England obtained sway in that country. The words of the Act were - " So muoh of any law or usuage now in force within the territories subject to the East India Company as infllots on any person forfeture of rights or property, or may be held in any y;r to impair or affect any right of inheritance. by- xeason of his or her renouneing or having been excltded from the communiono of a reli, 'en, or being deprived of caste, shall cease to be enforec'as las in the courts of the Eas India' Compsny and in the courts established by Boyal hsaiser within the same territorlties." What ha -led when that law was passed in 1850? All the chisf Xaue. proplietors wealthy merchants, and eminent literary pe,Lsons in Cilutts addressed a memoral against it tothe ;asvIndlaComnpany. The Directors promised to take their represenhztions into consideration, but they did aot do so, and the memoi'>l-which though emanating from flindoos, was one of the mo*~ maaterlt papers he had ever rad-w ~ ,snt to Pareet ad , usee, Itsa v s7ke1Jrb t,or gotten by the House, but was extremely important as exgessing the opinions of wealthy and powerful Hindoos. e rnemorialits, or petitioners, went deeply into all the questions involved inthe obnoxious law, which they strongly condemilned' as a breaking down of every barrier which religion, law and colstom had raised for the protection of HBindoo society, citing instanoes in which its operation would .wound-them in their tenderest and most cheriehed feeliags. The petitioners stated that they regaded the L.ct in its enirety a sabversve of Hindoo society, and they added th&t they did not feel called upon to defend their religion, which had been. banded down to them from theirancestors, and which was the religion of-100 millions of people. Th'a petition emanalted from some of the frst men in Cdcuttanot from armed Sepoys who had deserted their colours, bat from men of station, wealth, and intelligence. He thoughS the petition was very suggestive, and well worthy of the con. sideration of Parlimn t. Mr. V. SUITHthought the hon. and learned gentleman bad taken a course which want beyond even the usual license of discussioq upon the qdestion of adjournumentk for, having giveh notice of his intentfu to move for thSieprint' 3ng of a pdtitiou piqented in 185!, he had proceeded at once to dteuss that-ttibibn before the document hit been made nmovhn to the gou. Had he (&Er. V. Smith) been aware of tie hon. and learned gentlenman's inteation he should have been prepared to answer more fulUy his observations, but there was one matter which he was desirous of noticing at oice. 'The hon. and learned gentleman seemed to impute some indiseretion to General Hearsey, a distinguished odcer of the Bengal army, but one of the very last men who would make any imputation upon the Hindoos that he did not believe to be correot. That officer was mar. zied to a Hindoo lady, and was well known for his thorough acqusintanee with the language and habits of the people, With respect to the Act to which the hon. and learned gentleman referred, it was true that it was passed in 1850, but it was intended as the development of an Act of 1832, and it was so stated in the preamble of the Act of 1850. A petition was afterwards presented in 1853 to the committee, and evidence was taken, but nothing had been doine since then, as fer as he (Mr. Smith) was aware, by the petitioners. The Court bf Directors in 1851 intimated their entire approval of the provisions of the Act. Upon the 9th of April, 1850, Lord- Dalhousie wrote as folowes:- I Th6PGovernment will, doubless, continue as heretofore to administer to Hindoos the general body of Hindoo law; but I conceive that the Government will not do its duty if it leaves unchanged any portion of that law which inffiots personal injury on shy one by reason of his religtous beEief. In now acting on this principle I can see no semblance of interference with the religion of the Hindoos, nor ny unauthorized interference with rights secured to them." That was the opinion of Lord Dalhousie, and he (Mr. Smith) also deprecated any interference with the religious feelings of the Hindos; but at the same time he would caution the House against fanaticism of another kind, whicti would leave the convert to Christianity exposed to less of rights and privileges. (Hear.) They had been proceeding in one direction for some thne, but he hoped there would not be a reaction ia the opposite extreme, and that we should not permit Christian converts to be prosecuted because of their conversion. He admitted that the policy of the Act o. 1850 might be b doubtful matter, and that upon a future occasion it might be necessary to remodel it, and place the whole subject upon a better footing; but he hoped the House would not proceed upon an isolated act, but would treat it as a great question that otught not to be frittered awiay by partial dealings with particalar portions. (Hear, hen.) Mr. AYItTON considered it to be important that the House should be aware of the impression which prevailed abroad of the document that had been referred to. When Sir C. Napior came from India he had a oommunication with the Dtike of Wellington, who deired him to place his ideas respecting the Bengal army in writing. Sir C. Napier did so, and the memorandum he farnished was for- warded to Lord Dalhousie for his explanation. Those explanations were of such a charamter that it was not thought necessa7, to take any further steps in the matter. Such was the impression which prevailed abroad, and it would be desirable to know whether it was a correct impression or not. Sir E. COLEBROOKE said he found it had been stated by A gentlenan of great respectabUity and impartiality that much dissatisfaction had arisen from the passing of the law alluded to by the hon. and learned gentleman, which was bound ip with the Hlindoo law of inheritsapce. It was true that, on the other hand, it was hard that convertb to Christianity should be deprived of their rights to property in consequence of their conversion. The feelings of the do* however, were strong and their prejudices rooted, a4d he could not but believe that the la in question had been one among other causes of the wide-spread feeling of discontent which prevailed throughout Hindoetan, under the belief that the Government intended to interfere with the exerc.se of their religion. Then, again, about three years ago a despatch wag laid be! eParliament changing the fundamentit pricciples upon vhich education was carried out in India. The former poliy was to adopt the purely secular system of education, but the despatch in question introduced the whole system of rPrivy Council grants to All sects and religions andtoeveryinissionaryestablishmentthroughoutthecotntry. The other dy a noble lord in another place referred to the fact that eord Canning had given money in aid of missionary institutions in India. . The reDly to this was that he had distibuted none of the publI6 money for that pur- poe, Butjhe natives of India were unable to make ny distinction between the public and private acts of the Governor-General, and therefore he thought any distribution of mouby for missonary purposes by Lord Canning was in the highest degree objectionable. (Hear.) A few nights ago bfs ight hon. friend (Mr. V. Smith) spoke in terms of cenpure of Colonel Wheeler for having endeavoured to spread Christianity in his reghnient;* but when the heads of the Government set the example, with what consstency couldtheyfind fault writh their servants? (Hear, hear.) When the G~ove20ment of India set an example to the:r servants in this matter we ued 'not be surprised to find that example Iiftated. (HIear, hear.) He felt it his duty to state his opinions to the House on this matter, bec~use he regarded It as one of very great importance. He entreated the Government to take the subject Into their serious consideration, for he believed that this in connexion with other causes hd had no shght effect in producing a feeling among the population of India, the cuansequences oZ which had been developed so alarmingly in the native army: of Bengal. (Hear, hear.) Mr. YANTLES, after the fair and proper manner in wvhich the hon. and learned member (Mr. Whiteside) had brought forward this subject, felt bound to admit in the frankest mainer that he (hfr. b1a;,,gleg) was wrong in what he hsd stated the other day. He had spoken from memory, and bad not soes the law to which the hon. and learned gentle' man referred for several years, and he was mised by the cirodmstanse that in the committee of 1853 one or two geatlemen, one of them a barrister from Calcutta, gave evi- denoe favourable to the views of the society in this matter. The subject of conversion to Chistianity aad she retention of property by the converts was pointed at, but he did not remember that the question of loss of caste was at all raised. The gentleman to whom he had alluded contended, on the authority of one Sanders, that those who became converts to Christianity might expect to suffer Dersecution and the loss of their procerty, and that, therefore, the converts in India had no right to complain if, in be- coming Christans and earning all the advantages attached to that profession, they suffered the dis- advantages also, one of which was the loss of their wsorldly goods. (A laugh.) He must apologize to the hon. and learned gentleman, ut he hoped be had not contradicted him with Kanthin like rudeness. The law, he might obseerve, was as applicable to ahommedans as to Christians. It was intended to savze converts from the loss of their property, and he still thought that the law was a wise and a just one. (Hear, hea.) Sir C. WOOD said, the hon. and learned gentleman opposite had made an attack on the minute of education of 1854, which was drawn up, and for which he was responsible, when he was President of the Board of Control, and he had totally misapprehended the facts when he stated that that minute was drawn up under any pressure whatever. It was onsidered with great deliberation, and adopted after having been submitted to the whole Court of Directors. Per- sousbest acquainted with Iudiasere oonsulted on the subject and they all agreed in opinion that no danger could resul7 from carrying out that minute to its fullest extent. He would read one or two extracts from the docuament to show that It was not in any seanm uJsVU 4, tu. ahoge of introducing a proselyizing spirit in India. (Hear.) The hon membeer for Lanarkshire had stated correctly what the view A of the Government were upon this point. There was not the lightest feeling against the missionies as aissionaries, but what was very properly objected to was that there should be any attempt en the parb of Governmeat or persons in authority acting with Government to endeavour to proselytize In any way whatever. (Hear, heAr.) That was an opinion which he very strongly held; it was held by all the members of the Government, and he could truly say that ther had ever shown the most scrupulous abstinence from everysthing tha could be construed into iterference with the religion of the people of India, whether MIahoe medans or H Iindoos. (Hear, hear.) The minute with reference to the Government schools statod that "it wvas and is indispensable that the education conveyed in these schools should be exclusively secular." (Hear, hear.) Then, with reference to grants in aid, which were given to the schools of all denominations, whether Christian, Jew, Mahommedan, or Hindoo, it was steted, "1 The system of grants in aid will be baed on an entire abstinence from all interference with the reli Ious truction conveyed in the schools assisted." (Hear, bear.) Bequests for aid in certain cases were refused, as being opposed t, the religious neutrality to which they had always adhered. Hear.) It was provided that '- schools conduted by all denominations of Christians, EHndoos, Mahommedans, Par- sees, Buddhists, Jews, or any other religious persuasion, may he affiliated to the universities." (HIear, beer.) Now, he did not know how it was possible to carry out more completely the principles of rel- gious equality ln the schools than ws id down i ths minute, there being, as he had shown, the most careful abstinence from all interferene with the religion taught in those schools. (Hear, hear.) The motion thst the .oose at its rising adjourn till fonday was then agreed to. DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES BILL. The adjourned debate on the second reading of this Bill was resumed by Yr. GLADSTONE, who said-In justification of the eco,as which was adopted last week, when a considerabl. portion ,of this House demanded further time for the consin deration oit the mrriage question, I could not appeal to anything more oonsplusive than the course of the present debate. La wokk my n.ole friend at tbo hoad of the Govern- I i I I ment, when he was told that the subjeot could nat be properly considered by the House in the present period and circamstances of the session, sid, on the contraryn that there was no reason why tke debate should not be condacted with the same ganest ness, foroe, and effect as at any other time, and might be extended for an unlimited period. (Hear, hear.) Now, Jst night what did we witness? No unkindness, undo2btedly, on the part of the House, bet such a degree of lassitude as was entirely unconquerable, and guch as made it scarcely possible for any gentlem-n to states is opinions to the House. (Hear, hear.) After the speech of my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General, with the single esception of the hon. member for Hertfordshire (Ur. Puller), eight gentlemen in succession-a ciro-amntanoe unparalleled in my experience-spoke on the same aide of this question (hear, heaz), not wanting, certainly-if I may presume to say so; and 1 will- not speak of their ability-in earnLstnesa in: expressing their views upon the ubject. (Hear, bean) Its rgnitade was admitted-its novelti not denied, andQ yel on one aide of the House it remained wholly undebite& (Hear, hear.) This extraordinary course of proooeding was at length consammated iato a climax, when the Secre6ary of State for the Home Department actually complained that a dividon did not take ploae ist light and spoke of premeditation as having been evinced to Involve the debate in difficulties. (Hear, bea,N [Sir G. Grey.-I never saw cleaer sigas of predatarmin tion.] My right hon. friend says he never saw clearer signs. of predetermination. But were;e signs on. the part of those who under circumstanese so discouraging were discharging their conscientious obligations, or were they on the part of those who, with this great, this new subject before them, remained systematically silent ? (Cheers.) I do not w ant to make anyciarge, or to lay any blame upon any one. This Is too serious and too sad a subjet to be connected with party feeling, or to he made the occasion of an attack upon ny Government. What I hAve said I have said not to throw e6nsure upon any one, but to show the justice o. the appeal of those who have urged that it was impossible to do justice to this subject in this sessioa and under the eireamastanoegin whichitispressedupon oar attention. (Elear.) Itmaybes idthat the daba't,wasallon one side, becausoe te speeches of those who wereopposed to the Bill coataiaed nothing which deserved an answer. That is languago which may be applied to any debate, bat it is enough to say that that is not the view tsken by many member not the least entitled to attention in this Hoase. (Hear, hear.) We are not attended to whea we say that the circamstances under which this Bill is pressed forward we unorecodented and unusual; nor whe we urge that those Who oppose the B11 do so in deference not only to their own sense of daty, bu' also to the strong feeling which is entertained upon the subjeet by the great mass of their fellow-subjects, and that we ae required to discuss one of the most difficult of all propositions at a period of the year when no such proposal has ever before been made to Parliament. We are not attended to when we say that there has not been time to lay before the House the ordinary intormation in the ahapeof facts and at . tistiS with which it is usnal to f arish it when called upo s to legislate on important matters, bat I hope we shall b3 attended to when we urge that the House is proceeding in entire ignoranoe of the strong feeling upon this sabjectdwhi'r exists among the people wherever it has been broug4t before them. (Eear,hear.) Itisvainto say that they ought t have known of this Bill before. The ciroulation of intelligence is not very rapid even in these days, if we mesn by that the bringing home of any subject to the minds of the people. I must take up the attention of the House for a few moments in showing how very recently the people out of doors have been made acquainted with the action of the Legislature on this BilL I have received letters from differet parts of the country, stating that it would have b3en easy to obtain vey numerously signed petitions against this Bill, but that seeing the manner mn which the Government were determined to prese it forward it was deemed uselesa. I have received letters from various parts, from Cornwall, from SomersetehLire, from Saffolk, ad from other places, all stt that3 had there been more time petitions maight have baeen os-wrded signed by the great majority of the population, not only churchmen but religions DissenterNs. They all tell me of the greatrepugnace which this Bill excites in the minds ot the labourmng classes, and one of my correspondents quotes to e the language of a laboarmg sean, who said that instead of marriage being " until death do us part," is would be for the future " ntil we do quarrel" Then my correspondent goes on to give me a sample of this languge, which certainly showrs that the feeling entertained is very strong. I dare say that you wfll.tel that these people do not understanld the nature of the provisions of this Bill (hear, hear); but can there possibly be a stronger reason for askinig for time to consider thems? (Counter cheers.) Idonotdoubt that such is the case. I have seen signs in the netitions that' even some mong the best educated classes do not understand the proisions of this BilL Sarely, then, It is inconsistent with the generalpolinyof Parliament, with prudence, andr mayalmostsay with decency, that sach ameaure shouldbe forcedon. (Hear, hear.) And what is the reason for forcing it on? It is not, surely, the importance of settling a question by the delay of which one or two or three individuals may be affectead My noble friend the member for Kings Lynn who seemed to know a great deal more about our motives than we know ourselves, toldusmostingenuouslythathisreaAaon fornot wishing to delay the Bill was, we might be able to show that we had done something, that we should not be compelled to present a blank roll of legisation to the country. That is my noble fiiend's reason for presing forward the Bill But we have no right, I maintain, to make a charcter and reputation for the Bouse by passing a most importaut measure without the full consideration and imnportanoe it dcemands, simply because it is pressed upon us by tbe Government. (Cheers.) Are we likely to recover or preserve our esmtiation in the country by such an attsempt to keep up appearances ? No! Our estimation in the oountry depends not on the quantity and rapidity but on the quality anId stability of our egslation. (Chee.) We are told that We cannot approch thl question, more psrticularly considering the posit.cn in which we are placed by the previous practioe of Parliamnet, without considering the alternatives. As has been stated by my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General, we have been in the habit of passing private divorce Acts, and those private Acts for a long period have passed without objection. I do not at all dissemble that this consttutaes a real and serious difficulty in the matter, but this I do say, that of the three alternatives before ns,-the passing of this Bill, continuing to pass private Acts as before until we see our way better before us, or the stopping of these private Acts altogether, the alterative of passing this Bill is the most dangerous. (Chee) I frankly own I have never seen greater signs of what may he called a crude state of the Parliamentary mind upon this subject. (EAL) I plead guilty to it myself. It is only durin the present year that I have found leisare to inquire into tfis subject, and I do not feel sr-epared to pass a deliberate opinionron it lt we have bad more time for consideration. in the public jourals that 10 minutes', some sLy half-an-hour's, consideration will suffice to settle the question. Such sug. gestions as these may prove the rashness with which some men would undertake to decde the most sacred and solemn questions, but they do not tend to diminish the real difficulties of the caee, nor do they avail to guaad us from the fuatre emnbarrasmentintowhich such rasbness would most assuredly lead us. (Hear.) It has been said, ¶thy have you not objectd to the private Bills7-and theinference sought to be drawn from our not objecting to those Bills is that we ought not to oppow the Bill nowr before us. My answer to that is that when Parliament has entered into a oourse of passing private Bills in the nature of prisdIcgia for individual&. it ceases to be competent, morally compnetent at les. to take an effectual objection to any one of those private Bills. We had a strong instanoe of this the other day in the case of Shepherd's Disabilities Bill, for which there bad boen but four or five precedents; but it was argued that bypng previous Bils of the sort Parliament had consUtit to this individual a right of expectin4 that the same Bil should be pmsed in his instanoe; and kt was saidthat, however much weobjeoted, we must be content to pass this Bill and afterwards to rae the ganeral question. There is nothing more oert3in in the history of thbiquestionw-adt lts is one of the many inaccura cies in what I must callthe very inaccurate speech of the Attorney-General, to which I shell have to draw the attention of the House-than that this fied system has been so little fixed that, wvhenever the practice of pasng divorce Bills has atay period shown a tendency to growv frequent, there has been a strong Parliamentary reaction with a viewr to check the pressure. Towads the close of last century Idemands of that kldn werae made to limait the practie. I grant that they were defeated, and that the practineattalned a certain extension; but, surly, the very fact that privte persons never could come before Parliament and claim these divorces ex debito jshtitiw ought to be a sufficient proof of the absolute neoessity for a fuU discusdon of the case before entering on a new course of proceeding. When, instead of repeating to-day what was done yesterday, you enter upon a new system and talcea ne startirng pointk then it is that, by every consideration of justioe ad proI priety, ve are not only entitled but bound to examine into the whole matter, aud to entrew. the House to consider the people upon which it is about to act. Now, it may be said that tho two statements, that there is great danger in precipitancy, and that there is a strong feeling in the country against this measur and no strong feeling sL its favour, are antagonistil, becauseitmay be urged that if we legislate hastily, still if the public re not blindly in favour of the measure, if they are strongly opposed to it, it will be easy to retrace our steps. Iu my cpiuon,torey upon such a representation woipldbeto truatto av The feelingof the countrymnay be, as Ibeheve from the very imperfect evidence which we have been allowed to colect it is, against this measre, but -if the Bill be pass, although an overwhelming majorit of Christian husbds and wives maybe against it, you will have constituted an interest ia behilf of certain parties who will become, as it were, an entire sect in fayvo of such laws, h for their maintenanoe and for their extenson, d the prescription right whih they will have acuired in consequence of yourlegision wil make it impossible for youto corre the results of any hasty and precipite decion. Now, Sir, what is the effect of the Bill before ns ?-because it is netimesaid,and in certain sense it is sald with trut, that it is a Bil of moderate scope and extent, the operation of which ito deal with marriage as a whole and in al its clLaacterse But what are the character of mariage? They re admirably described in a passage by Lord Stowell, an authority whom we need never apologize for quotisg in this HIouse (hear), because there is no. page in his works wh4chl have weee which will not repay any attention that may be bestowed upon it. Lord Stewell admirably discrimiustes the theefold chaacter of marriage. He says - tion of wsiety, and as important but a mere personal con- tact between the two prties. When society was Icex it became xot-ofsly a personal biuts cil cont , eemct with civil privileges and obligton.-0 Wkwdlile-mAi n dp)eo were receivd in State the mariruaga elglous eontrct, accom nied with pli gh s, an4 callingupon Heasen t .itness them.- Tilde. .ia F 3ziLrirge contract ws hdssoluble was tin te o struetion put upon oertain texts of Scriptu -183.

Tli. standing order of the Lords says:- 'Ordered hythe,Lords Spiritual and Temporal inPaR- lianent assembled that no BMl groun4ed cna petion toi; thi House to disslve a marriage for the cause of adultery. and to enable the petitionertomuary agdn, shall be regive&i by this House, unless a provision be inseted in sech -BiLI that it shall not be lawful for the person whoe JnrSI with the petitioner xhal be dimsslved to interm with. any offending party on account of whose adultery with such. person iL shall be therein enaoted that such marriage shad be so dissolved."

That is the standing order of the House of Lorid ve Divorce Bill is introduced into that Eouse with a clauas6of this description, and from every such Bill that claue bas,, for a number of years, been struck ou. Thus, the sanding order and the practioe of the House of Lords are at vadznee upon this vital point, as many pesns regard it, of the intermarriage or remarriage of the guilty parties, and yet my, hon. nd learned friend te;lB us that the code of proceduxein these matters is as well established as that of any otherbranch of the law. (Hear, kee.) My. hon.nnd leune& friend says that divorce is a principle of the Beformation.

(Hear.) If I grant to him that the Bill -s Parlian*entary precedent, yet I say it introdnoes entirely a new law for the purpe to. which it is addressed (Hear.) What does it eontgtplate! Does it merely propose a continuance of these precedentq ? Is not this the very grouudwork of the Bill-that beretoforwe have limited the power of obtining divores to the wealthiest clases in the country? And that is true. I believe there is on reoord the case of a Mr. Chipndale, or some such nsme, who was allowed to sue in fos'spasU but, speaking generally, your lw if -you like to cal it a law) was strictly limited tothe higheet sesofthiscountry -such as could afford to pay' a large 2um to set it In opeantion. What is my hon. and learned friend cing to do ? HIe is going to gsive you a law under which divorce is to be made accessible to all asses ofthe commRUIty. Is notthat a new laW? (Hear.) You have got upon your tstute-book anA.t which. rovides tat the me3eben-cf the Roal Fauiily shall not be permitted to marry excepti after a certain timce and w.ithout the consent of the Sore. reign. But that is not a principleof the Britih lwfor the whole community i it is a principle of ene law for the Royal family and for thei. alone; and so also ihiscode aboutwhich usy hon. andlearned friend speaks,and under whichhesays a princinle of law has been estalished, is a code entiely foreilc to the British nation. (Hear.) Your middle classes your'lower classes care no moe for it than if instead o' being a eod, for the use of the nobility and high gentry ef England, it had been estlblished for hie use of the inhabitants of the planet Jupiter. (A laugh.) 3tlttudes of them don't even know of its existen-nay, there are mayclerymeneven who are ignorant ofits existence. The fade oftFe occurrence every eaDr of one or two of these Divorc, Bills limited to particular classes of societyhs had no mzoo effect upon the mass of the British people than if 3o. Divorce Bill had ever passed. (Hea, hear.) I am eoet anisj Sir, to make this assertion broadly becaus it is vital to the whole case. The hoz, and learned xenIle- man says be is brnging forward no new law. WA, I won't argue with him whether it is anew kwas re that infinitesimal prt of Enqiad to which it applie% bu: say the present Bill pledges hnm to cary divoroe to the door of all men of aln lasses, and bis law, therefore, i as completely novel to all intents and purpose as if the first BMU1 of divorce, passed in the case of Lord Roe, in the rein of Charles IL, had never been Introduced into Pnrliament,ani ha never been followed up by others to pander to theya.. ioDsof8soCiety.

The letter of our Bombay correspondent will be quickly searched by many an anxious eye, in quest of places and names, or of anything that may indicate the end of the Indian struggle. No doubt, to such an eye it will read gloomy enough. A vast region of peace and security, hitherto known to most of us as the golden soil where young gentlemen rise rapidly into fortune and honour, where beardless civilians rule provinces, and youngsters get the pay of Generals, is seen under a sudden cloud of revolt. All at once the cohesion which bound a great empire in loyalty to a far distant name has ceased, and the mass is resolved into its first elements. Station after station is infected ; regiment after regiment rises, under a common feeling, rather than a common design, and happily with no plan of future operations. A strange distemper rages through the native army, and it loses its allegiance as it might its colour or its health. In one place the regiment mutinies at once; in another it wavers and is disarmed; in another it acts the hypocrite, vows fidelity, demands to be led against the insurgents, and then itself revolts; in another it is led against the mutineers, and joins them; in some places the Mutiny is only partial, aind the sound portion puts down the unsound; some half-dozen places will acquire an evil name for the atrocities there committed; in as many the European officers have escaped, either by the kindness or by the carelessness of their own insurgent soldiers. Such is the checkered story of a revolt throughout a vast region, more than a thousand miles from one end to another, running up into a newly-acquired country, traversed by rivers in the hands of the natives, and bordered right and left by States that will be true only as long as they feel it their interest to be so. In many districts the communications are interrupted, the wire out, and the means of conveyance everywhere dependent on natives. Thus the horrors, Fuch as there aire,and there are not a few,-are aggravated by obscurity. The storm is terrible, but its darkness is even more awful than its lightning. Intelligence must arrive but slowly. We must submit to what many feel an agonizing suspense, in which everything Is horrible whiieh is unknown. Yet the greater part of this horror disappears when we come to contemplate the matter-we-will not say calmly, but with a simple view to ascertain the real state of things. Why is it all so dark and uncertain ? Why has the Bengal Army "disappeared V" Why this collapse-| this crumblin3g of the fabric, this trance of authority ? If it reflects blame upon us, it proves no less the weakness of that which we have to deal with. There is only one idea.i. t;he Mutiny, and that is to run off to DelAi, the tra ! ditional seat of Indian empire. From the most remote and opposite points there is till a flight to Delhi. Plan or no plan, wl at is the result t It isat least just what we should desire. It is the old Indian story-an immense accumulation of men easily dealt with and finally disposedof. Yet, if Delhiis such1 a trap, we may possibly pay for it. We have made it ourselves a sort of Indian Sebastopol, strengthened it, and filled it with cannon and ammunition. Why we ever did this with a place of high lahomedan fame, and then assigned it to the keeping of an exclusively native force, we need not now inquire. We now hear further that several thousands of the defenders are encamped under the guns outside the walls, and, what is worse, that ,this "1 SebastopolV can be supplied to any extent by th'e Jumna, which' flowx 'Under its palace,'_ and which is in the hands of the nafives. But, if it is to. Ahee circu m.Q% ULat we owv this flight to Delhi, we must not quarrel with them, or even ,t the policy of leaying, a " queen "bee" in: the hive. Nowhere else is any stand made agaist 'ua,. even where one might haye been expeoied. At Allahabad a handful of E1ro,peua invalids defendd . the fort and o4e of the objet arsenail in Xndia against cevqral. native reimnents. At 3enares, eyen with the ,aid of rregubras and a Sikh Regmnent, the, mutineers were beaten off and driven towards Delbi by a company of Artillery and a handful of the Quzs?S 13th and the Madras Fusileers.. In fact, wherever there was an European force the euperiority of the turopean has been establ shed against the greatest oddi, anid under circumstances of nuch discouragement. So, in the midst of fighting in Ouae, at Aurungabad, and other places, authority has been aternly and fearlesaly vindicated by public executions, with the best results. There have been many lamentable assassinations, -some of them mere surprises, and amply avenged. That they should be noted as exceptions, and that any of the officers should escape from a general Mutiny in the heart of a sympathizing population, indicate either a want of plan or of earnestness, or, what would be better still, the want of a real quarrel with the officer. In' actual fighting . we have hitherto beaten the natives thoroughly, with very, little loss. The only officer lost under the walls of Delhi has been Colonel CHEST=, Adjutant-General of the Army, whose place has been excellently supplied by CH. BEnLAI, who was gent into Affghanistan to communicate with Dosa MAl;osrD as to the expulsion of the Peraia. from Herat. As for the behaviowr of the native Princen and the various bodies of Irregulars, it ies not alwapys,o good or satisfactory as it mlght be, but. not worse than was expected. Many of Scimuis' 'Contingent have left us, and it is not to be supposed that any native chief loves us much for our own sakes. The Ghookas and other native troops collected against Delhi, and brought into action immediately, behaved very well. A corps of Guides made a march of 750 miles in 28 daysfrom the Punjab. Thus the defection, though in a sense universal, and summed up in the expresaton that the Bengal Army has ceased to exist, has many exceptions, has only partially spread to the Contingents of the native Chiefs, only slightly to the Irregulars, and not at all to the' other Presidencies. All the fighting has been in our favour. Even . the murders, -which contribute so dark a colour to this disaster, indicate a weak, cowardly people, not to be dreaded in the open field except under the command of a superior race, or the influence of an extraordinary geniu. As yet no leader has appeared, and we have only to hope and pray that none such may be founsd among the native Chiefs. The British publiciin India seemed to be well assured of the restlt ; and, what id more satisfactory, to believe that the Goverinent and arny are in good hands. There ame no complaints of delay. . Our news from Delhi comes only down to 'the. 38th day frown the first outbreak., and already two battles had beenfought under its walls, in both of which we were victorious.
If any enthusiastic Law Reformers antioipate grect and immediate public benefit from the Consolidation of a portion of the Statutes they may, very possibly be doomed to disappointment; but, on the other hand, it is difficult to believe that the Bills which have been sent dowsn frora the House of Lords can be really dangerou or alarming. The House of Commons has, for once, only the choice I between -two courses. The Bills may be passed, or tiLy may be thrown over to a f'uture Sessions. Mr. NAPIER cannot but. admit the jujtice of Loitd PA.IERSTOW'S suggetion, that measures of t+Is kind must, especially at the close of a Seson,ibe accepTted as they itand, or'altogether defe4` No deliberative assembly can discuss the details ot even an inconiplte Code with any prospect of advantage. It is to be hoped that, in the words of the Minister, " the House will be disposed to take the "BiUls upon trust, as a faithful consolidation of the "existing law,vwithout any change or addition, and, 5having tal;en and passed them as such, will *make them the foundation of future legisla"tion." The present CHANCELLOR of the ExcHsEQmn, in his treatise On the Iifluence of Authlwity in Matters of Opivion, has shown by many learned and philosophical arguments that, although men may in some cases depend on their own knowledge, it is occasionally necessary to rely on the betterintstructed judgment of others. The opinion of the House of Commons on the terms of a Conssolidating Statute must assuredly depend on the infiuence of authority, and in the present instance there is no reason to suppose that its reliance will be misplaced. When an engineer is. employed to make an estimate, or an accountant to draw up a balance-sheet, the accuracy of the necessary data and calculations is generally assumed writhout further inquiry. In the present case the Commisoioners have acted as the professional advisers of Parliament, and it must be supposed that they have accomplished the task which they were employed to perform. The abstinence of the Law Lords from introducing any aAendement into the Bills is the best proof of their substantial accuracy. No one can doubt that those indefatigable critics would have been eager to pounce upon the authors of the ConsolidaUtion if they had either produced a faulty work or exceeded the limits of their commission. Wheso the CHAXCELLOx is allowed to carry an unopposed Bill through the House of Lords, it must be understood that Lord BROUGHuAm and Lord ST. LEONARS'S are sti ngly persuaded of the utility of the measure. Mr. AiLDY objects that it is useless to re-enact, in a consecutive order a mass of Statutes which are for all practical purposes already consolidated by text-writers. It is perfectly true that existing compilationa and indexes afford al the information which is required for professional use, but it seems' natural and decorous that Parliament should adopFand supersede the meritorious laoours of volunteers. The more plausible complaint of Mr. NAPr, that changes in the law are introduced into the Bils, will be found in several cases to reduce itself to the inevitable choice between conflicting enactments and contradictory interpretations.' It is highly in3probable' that the alleged innovations are either extensive or pernicious. Inx legal questions the existence of a doubt is generally more mischievous than any definite decison. The changes which are really intrpiucede are trifing. ihL themselves; and inx general they are merely, intenaded to correct an oversight, of the Legislature. if -it is crhnina to dmage a bridge over a river there. seems, to. be no- dangerous jncvation in extending the same protection to. a railway viaduct over a road. The real value of a Consolidation of the Statutes consists in the fact that it is the first step.tto the formation of a Code. There is no reason whiy a competent body of Commissioners should not certify to Parliament the actual provisions of the 'law in aU departments of jurisprudence. By far the greater portion of the systemn might be at onte reduced into the form of enactments, so that the. labours of Law Reformers would be concentratedon the reniaining parts of the system. - InSr Xa1i instances a good modern text-book, with! the Ornhision.of the disseitatioxisalnd authoritieo; Atgh b6 compressbd-iiito an AcA Whil'C wobld piop'elyu take its place in a Code. It ii., of course, inrpos-klq J terminate 8AM90-y and vner- i tAinty. No universal rule will provide for al! the circumsances which may ariss hereafter, but the resultof all-past litigation m4y be condensed into a limit-ed pace. Legislators and lawyers only require htqtke a fresh departure. In a fear years e,xperiecoe vrill,point out the omiesions of the (ae, nd judial terpiet*tions will once inore supply the. efects of 0tatutab1e legislation. I If such a task is at any future time. to be achieied, T'ariiUgnez,t miut be content with the unambitiXus duty of recording and sanctioning the decisions of pro,fesional legislators. Some years Since the law of the State of NOew York, which w1as 74elntis,.1. withour own, was consolidatod anl extenasively revised. The Bill which contained the newOode waa brought before the House of A,,enbly in a m9orng sitting, and referred to a Committee,' with instructions to report in the course of the afternoon. -Before night the measure was passed without any attempt at amendment, and the results of the new system have been highly beneficiaL The representatives of the State understood that 'tey. muAt either dispense with the benefit of a Code or-, accept it on trust. The House of Commons ought to exhibit equal judgment in dealing with the safe and moderate instalment of law reform which pro-, ceeds fromthe Statute Commissioners. The ordiYa.r forms of legislation, are intended to.guard 8gaAat precipitate changes, and adapted to xpecific provisions for definite purposes. An Act of parliani,At in general introduces an exception or innovation, bat a Consolidating Statute is in its nature historical and declaratory. A detailed inquiry into the accuracy of a professional compilation, .would be equally endless and useless. In the great majority of Parliamentary discussiops tfe. aigumnents ,hich are pressed. upon: opbonbts *. really irnended for the supporters of a.mneasure. A Minister seldom hopes to donverthis Udversaies, but the reasons which fail to convince them may cause them to be outvoted., In the present instance the Government, and consequently the measure itself, are in some degree nt thn mercy of those who .think with Mr. N .IEIv Delays occasioned by a debate whether the Consolidation Bills shall be taken claue by clause will have precisely the same effect as the waste of time which would be occasioned by tte actual examination of the various provisions. It is only by a strong and general expression of. opinion on all sides of the House that .Ird PAArMrFTON can be enabled to carry a series of measures to which no seriousl Objection can be entertained. :Nine-tenths of the memblera are not only'pledged to promote the reform of the law, b3ut geneirWy incined to can7 out their proMise,s. lFo 'r interest of any kind is involved in the proposed reduction of the great bulk of Stattes. The triiumpli of. the opponents would be achieved not so mucb at the expense of the Governtaent as over tlie laSoriOns and unpretending lawyers who 'avb drawm up the scheme of Consolidation. Each of the Bills is preceded by a summnary of the Acts which it aiipriedes, including a statement of the ilterations *hicb. have been- made upon the original dri6ught. The Deer, Game, and Rabbits *Bill. contain.s in 50 clauses the statutable Game Law, extracted from seven existing Acts. The Forgery Bill, of 41 clauses, consolidates foui Acts, commencing with the 1st of. WILLIAr IV., cap: 66, which was itself a consolidatiQn of the existing law.: The Commissioners have ventured on the bold innovation of omitting the provisions relating to forgeries on the South Sea Comnpan,, ,hich has ceased to exist. If all their modificaiions of previous Statutes are found to be equally modest, Dir. NA.rrm himself will, perhaps, be contented to withdraw his opposition. The - Tkarcentill, which provides for nine-tenths of the criminal cases brought before the Courts, .contains 10 clauses, consolida,ting the provisioWs of 21 Acts..',ome amendments of importancee ~lavelgeen int,rotaiA .to nmeet maulfest omis5i6s, " or to include cases which crearly ought to. be "mode *criniinal.'~ As a specimen of the proposed changes, it may be mentioned that a servant of several persons, not partners, may henceforth bB found guilty of embezzlement. The Libel Bill comprises in 10 clauses the provisions,' both civil and criminal, of six eiting Statutes. A Bill of the same length supplants five Acts relating to aecessories ancd abettors. Sixteen Acts relating to offences against the person are consolidated into a Bill of 70 clauses. 'The Coinage Offences Bill, with 37 clauses, contains some changes in the actual law. FinaLly, the Bill relating to maliciolls injuries to property contains 76 clauses, and consolidates nine existing Statutes. The Clriminal Law, always the simplest and most intelligible branch of English jurisprudence, will probably hereafter serveas a model for more ambitious and difficult reforms.
The House of Commons is certainly in a very liberal mood. How long the fit may last it is impossible to say, but we recommend those who have any unredressed grievances, any outstanding demands, any claims for compensation, of whatever kind, to sit down quickly and make out their bills. So favourable a season may not soon occur again. By and by a stingy fit will succeed ; but at present expenditure is the order of the day, and we will not venture to ausign any bounds to the generosity which the guardians of the public purse may be disposed to exhibit in dealing with the funds intrusted to their care. A remarkable instance of this munificent disposition occurred on Wednesday last. On that' -day Lord NAs's Bill for Amending the Superannuation Act war carTied by a large majority in a tolerably full House, and received further confirmation on Thursday night by the announcement of the Pm s- MmisTrm' that it was not his intention to offer any further opposition to its progress. It is one of the shortest Bills that was ever submitted to Parliaimnt, consisting of a single clause of less than tbree lines; and, its object being to mako short work of the public money, its brevity. is certainly appropriate. However, as our readers may not perhaps at' first sight understand the precise character of the measure, we will very briefly explain its, meaning. The Civil servants of the CRoxni may be divided into two clases-those who are, and those who are not, entitled to,superannuation allowances; 'and of the former class, aga, there are those whose salaries arie paid in full, and those whose salaries are subject to certain deductions levied for the purpose of defraying the expense of that contingency. The' last mentionedc section of the Civil ssrvants, amounting, in round numbers, to about 16,000 persons, calie into existence in 1829, and took theis situations on the express condition of sur. rendering a. certain portion of their nominal. Wa4rfes. for the purpose above described. Inasmuch, however;, as the deductions from their salaries combIenced. from the date of their appointment, while the retiring pensions attached to their situations were only a remote contingency, it would necessaxily happen that the aggregate araount of the deductions would greatly. exceed that of the pensions, until sufficieit time should have elapsed to entitle a large number of the body to the benefits of the' superannuation allowafice. It is a majttr of controversy whether or not, in the long run, the ieductions will cover the expense of the pensions 'the actuaries asserting ort. thing. and the Treasury maintaining aniot4er. eh poinm 7 not very material, except as !bending to hoWd the uniatisfactory and obj" rtier character of the arrangement itself. Indeed, we can hardly conceive U mode of pay- menatsfore thoroughly ealcnlated to produce dissatisfacdoin, and to bring about a oollision between the employers and the employed. The Government of the day might have adopted a scale of salaries founded on the principle 'of paying well for the . worlk done, but -leaving to its servants the duty of maldng provision for themselves agai,t the time of old age or retirement from service. -Such 4% arrangement, if not-baed upon sound -and practical views of human nature, would at lit !have been intelligible, and consistent wiih the general axioms of political economy. It would, moreover, have hlad its attractions for the more independent and energetic class of characters who look to the presat more than to the future. On the other hand, it might have adopted the principle of a lowvrer scale of salary, subject to no deductions, but combined. witb. a retiring pension in the event of certain contingencies. Such an arrangement would be calculated to secure the permanence of the employ6s, and would present peculiar attractions to the more prudent and less enterprising class of, minds. Butt the arrangement made in 1829. appears to us to have violated every sound principle. It adopted a low scale of salaries without immunity from deductions, and a system of unperanmuation allowances -without the grace which ought always to attach to it. The vQry. term " allowance" conveys the idea of a free gift from one person to another; b-at-how can that be conridered a gift which the recipient has paid for out of his own pocket ? Can any arrangement be conceived more calculated to create discontent in the claws to which it is applied than that which tells a man " Your salary is so and so, "but we shall deduct a certain portion, not to "provide against the contingency of sicknes-not "to insure your life for the benefit of your family"not even to invest in the savings-bank for your "ultimte advantage, but to enable us to provide vretiring allowances for such of our servants as "may be incapacitated by age or infirmity frorn ".fulfilling their duties any longer ?" This, thenj is the principle with which Lord NAs's Bill prfeses to deal, and had it been confined to that object it should have received our mnoat cordial support. We have been foremost in laying the case.of the Civil servants before the public, and in endeavouring to place their remuneration on a more rational and equitable footing. But there is one point which Lord NAs's Bill wholly ignores, and that is the existence of an implied contract between the existing Civil servants andthe public, founded on the arrangement which we have so often,. condemned. The Commissioners themselves, upon whose report the Bill professes to be based, while. admitting the tendency of the deduction 3ystem to produce a sense of injury and wrong among those to whom it is applied, say that,- "Without denying that such feelings are natural . in par. sons so situated, and without exprening here any opinion as to the policy of the system, it may be sficient for our prent purpose to state that the CiviL servant was, or ought to have been, aswae that on his appointment he entered into a contract under which he agreed to make certain pay. ments on condition of reoeiving a return for sach payments in the shape of a superannuation allowance only in the event of carta specified contingencies, which, in the cases in question, have never happened. The contract, therefore, has been strictly fulfilled." Again,-. "fWhether tne dedactions charged be more or less than an equivalent for the superannuations awarded, no Civil servant can jastly complain of any breach of engagement on this account, the terms of his servioe with regard both to deductions and superennuations having been well known at the time of his appointment." The effect, however, of the present Bill is not simply to cordemn the principle of deductions, but to make a direct, though indiscriminate gift, of 75,00.0t. a-year to a certain portion of the Civil servants. This is a result for which we confess we were not prepared; because neither we, nor, we imagine, the great - bulk of our representatives in Parliament, can possibly be in a position to determine offhand whether or not such an addition to the salaries of the Civil servants is required upon any grQunds of public policy. While; therefore, we rejoice to find the deduction system unequivocally condemned, we must disclaim all responsibility for the consequenees which its sudden downfall may possibly entaiL Should the public be eventually losers by the transaction, the blame must rust upon those who have obstinately supported a vicious system till it& continuance could be no longer endured.

TME INDIAN MUTINIES. We have received from our correspondent at Bombay the following admirable desciiption of the state of affairs in India at the date of the Overland Mail which arrived late last night - " BOM3BAY, Xmiz 28. "The departure of the mail, which was fixeld for yesterday afternoon, has already been postponed till to-morrow morLing, and wil very probably be atillfurther delayed in the hope that it may be able to convey to you certain intelligence that the stronghold of the revolted soldiery of India is in the hands of the avenging army. For, although a fortnight has passed since I closed my last letter, and although we were even thea expecting each hour to hear that the blow struck under';the walls of Delhi on the 8th had been followed up by the reduction of the city, I have stil nothing stronger than rumour whereon to base the announcement of that anxiously expected Iconsummation,-rumlour, indeed, explicit in character and widely diffused, reaching ns from several quarters at a greater or less distance from the scene of action, but lacking that certainty and official conarmation from Agra or its neighbourhood which I think it must, if true, have before this received. Making every allowance for the interception of the telegraphic communicatioa with Agra-the wire being cut somewhere in the Gwalior country-and for the inter. ruptions that are probably attendant in certain districts upon the dawk traffic, the Bombay public is till beginning to doubt, for want of subsequent corroboration, the report which at first it so reaUily believed. This, however, is the story :-Delhi was stormed and taken- on the 12th, with great slaughtex to the mutiaeers, the remnant of whom took refuge within the Palace, the lofty but decayed walla of which could afford them but a temporary refage. The Poonah Obsmrver, ' from a private source,' accomplishes their destructior en the 14th; but this assertion, as unsupported, I mention with distrust; and this is it, history. Mr. Harvey, the Commissioner, writing to A,gra on the 13th from PuIwnI, in the district, ' is assured that the place fell under the circumstances above detailed on the day previous. HiE letter is circulated in Agra on the 16th; its contents reach Indore (why so late I know not) on the 24th; and thence, the line being in vrorking order as far as that capital, are immediately telegraphed by the Resident to Lord Blphiastone. This was the most reliable source of the rumour which, however, had reRched us from other sources, and was also matter of current gossip in the bazaar. I trust that it is true, but I dare not assert that it is, nor even that I believe it, or that others belleve it to be more than the forecast shadow of the coming event. May the event come quickly ! Of the discomfiture of the mutineers by General Barnard, on the 8th, telegraphed to Bormbay in time to find a place in my last, we have since received such details as a hasty despatch, written after the action to the Commaander-in-Chief, can afford. Marching from Alipore at 1 in the morning, the CGeneral found the enemy intrenched in a strong position orline of positions covering Delhi. By 9 o'clock he had c3rried the whole of them in the face of a stubborn resistance, and had driven the matineers within the walls of the city, upon which he was intending to open with his heavy artillery, without a moment's delay. The Ghoorkas, Sappers, and Miners, and other Native troops engaged (irregulars, I believe) behaved admirably, as did the contingents furnished by the tributary Rajahs. Oae officer only was killed, Colonel Chester, AdjutantGeneral of the Army. The general loss is not meationed, but is stated as comparatively trifling. On bhe following day, the 9th, as we learn by a notification issued from theJudicial Commissioner's office at Lahore, a sortie of the mutineers took place. They were attacked by the cavalry of the Guides, which had joined the army, and driven back to the walls by a brilliant and successful charge, in which, however, the commandant, Quintin Battye, fell mortally wounded. Upon the repulse of this sally we may presame that the siege was pressed with renewed vigour, possibly to the capture of the place on the 12th; but I confess I am prepared to hear that complete success was not quite so readily attained. The Generals, Reed and Barnard, might fid it advisable, I imagine, to thin the numbers of the insurgent soldiery and townspeople by a sustained lire of shot and shell, previous to committing their smaU force to the desperate chances of a storim and a street combat. "JULY L "I had written thus far when I found that the mail steamer would be detained till this afternoon. We have had further news from Delhi-news corrective of the above report, and corroborative of my doubts of its trath. Whatever else may be uncertain, that Delhi was not taken on the 12th of last month is parfectly certain. It was still in possession of the mutineers on the 16th, the date of our latest accounts from the army. On the 13th or 14th a second sortie was made from the city, in which the mutinied 60th, late of the liUballab garrison, took a leading part. Like that of the 9th, it was repulsed with severe loss, and on this, as on the former occa,ion, the gallantry and conduct of the Corps of Guides was emiaent. I find that not only, as I supposed, the cavalry of the corps, but also the infantry, are with the army, the latter having been brought down from the Punjab on camels. The cavalry made the astonishing march of 750 miles in 28 days. It were well if the General commanding could get a few thousand men like these, for of reinforcements he is sorely in need, and for want of them he was, on the 16th, pausing in his attack. By the 21st, however, he would, it is thought, receive a considerable addition to his strength in the European troops of the Jululundur Brigade, set free to act beyond the limits of the station by the mutiny and flight of the native portion of the brigade, the 6th Cavalry, and the 36th and Glst Infantry, who rose on the night of the 8th, and were chased out of cantonmenta till they disper3ed. The 8th Foot, Major Olpherts' troop of Horse ArtilUery (first of the 1st Brigade), and the head-quarters of the 1st Battalion of Foot Artillery, are thus rendered available in whole or in part; and from Forozepore, since the mautinies and the disarming, Her Majesty's 61st is able to spare a wing for Delhi, and two cormpanies, I. believe, of artillery. It is in the latter arm that the besieging force is especially weak, while the rebels are actuaUvy said to have no less than 150 guns in position. True, they have very few artillerymen, only one company, to work them, but even in the hands of Sepoys the great guns may do a good deal of mischief. Their number may be exaggerated, but it is to be remembered that the rebels; have the great arsenal of Delhi in their undisputed possesion. You will be anxious to know what number of the insurgent soldiery has collected in Delhi, while Generals Reed and Barnard were waiting for reinforcements. On the 16tb, according to the Judicial Commisioner of Lahore (the best authority now-a-days, for the telegraph is in working order between his city and the camp before Delhi), 3,000 of the rebels were encamped outiside the Ajmere-gate, and the force of the mutineers in Delhi appears not to exceed a few thouand,, even with the addition -f the 60th Native Infantry and some othens who ave lately joined them.' There ia svagueness in tbis %ount which, though perhaps inevitable is unt satisfactory. The phrase ' sorae others' is, it may be feared, an elastic one. Allowing that the mautineemr of Jullundur and Phillour (where-the -3& Native Infantry has risen) are unable to reach the revolted capital, still from Allahobad and even Benares, in the south (of which more presently), and from the Rohilcund stations in the easb, there is nothing to prevent the rebellious Sepoys arriving at the Doint to which it is known they were tending. Not that I think this consideration a discouraging one. On the contrary, I regard it as highly satiefactory that the revolt ha chosen for itself but one centre, for, that annihilated, it is utterly broken. Only knowing the vital importance of the conflict to which our generals are committed, the smallness of the force under their cornmand-which, even v;ith reinforcements, will hardly, I imagine, reach 6,000 men-thegreat extentof the city (fiveor simnilesfrom north to south), its populousness, and the fact that on the eastern or river side it is now entirely open to the mautineers to receive men or supplies from the Dosb,-we must not murmur against our chiefs if some days yet elapse before we hear that the place is taken. Already have appeared symptoms of this hasty and ignorant criticism. Poor General Anson was accused of culpable inaction till it was found that he had been waiting, and of course moAt wisey, for the aiege train from Phillour, having nothing buit field pieces with him D)oubtleas the delay in the captre of D)elhi. has* been unfortunate. It has led to the open mutiny of several rotten-hearted regiments, a fact in itself, perhaps, causing no great loss to the State, saving where European life was taken. But let it be remembered that the game to be played out at Delhi is one of which it is impossible to overestimate the value of the stakes, and one, therefore, not to be lightly taken in hand, nor to be conducted otherwiae than in a cautious, if also in an alert and vigorous mood. I have no fear but that the blow will be struck soon enough for the security of the empire. And when the retribution has come, as come it surely will, whe-n the puppet King of Delhi is taken or slain, when the streets of his capital are choked with dead, and every English bayonet is bent and bloody with the strife, then you will read the ghastly tale of the atrocities perpetrated in the accursed city, unsurpassed in kind, as will I thinlk appear, by anything recorded in history of the cruellest sack of a captured town, and will rejoice that your murdered countrymen and countrywomen are fully if fearfully avenged " But to complete the catalogue of mutinies and dizarmings known up to the present moment. When I closed my last I calculated that, in one way or another, some 28 regiments of regular infantry had ceased to carry arms for the Company. I now count upwards of 40,-perhaps as high as 46. In Rohilcund probably all the four regiments are gone, certainly the two at Bareilly-the 18th and 68th, with the 8th Irregular Cavalry and a company of Native Foot ArtilUery. blost of the officers have escaped, it is believed, to the hill sation of Nynee Tal or elsewhere, but the Brigadier, Sibbald, is said to have fallen, *nd many civllians are missing. Cawnpore, we believe, has been saved by the arrival of the Sth and of the 64th, the latter from Bombay. Bat the 19th Native Infantry has mutinied in BunUdlecund, and at Allahabad the 6th Native Infantry, which had been loud in its protestations of loyalty, and of its desire to be led against Delhi, rose and murdered Captain Bird, the Fort Adjutant, and all the European* they could lay hands upon. The rest took refuge in the fort, where they are stiU in safety, the mutineers having marched for Delhi. At Benares the 37th Native Infantry mutinied on an attempt being made to disarm them. Joined by the 13th Irregular Cavalry and the Sikh Regiment of Loodhiana, they killed Cpiapin Guise, of the cavalry,and attacked the guns of the European company of artiblery, but were repulsed by a discharge of grape, and by the resolute attitude of a handful of the Queen's 13th and of the Madras Fusileers. At Azimghur the 19th mutinied, and shot their adjutant, Lieutenant Hutchinson. At Ghazeepore the 65th has been disarmed. At Jaun pore the detachment of the Loodhiana Regiment foUowed the example of the head-quarters at Benares, kiUled Mr. Cuppage, the civilian, and badly wounded Lieutenant Mara, their commanding officer. All this in the Benares district. The rest of the Dinapore division has been quiet, with the exception of one deplorable occurrence at Rohnee. Major Macdonald, Sir Norman Leslie, and Dr. Grant, three officers of the 5th Irregular Cavalry, were attacked one evening when sitting in the verandah of the Major's house. Sir Norman was killed on the spot, and the other two severely wounded. The as3a8sins, at first supposed to be disbanded Sepoys, belonged, it now appears, to their own regiment, and have been given up for execution by their comnrades. The Barrackpore or Presidency division, as you will hear more fully from Calcutta, was so muoh agitated as to render it advisable to disarm all the troops at head-quarters, consisting of the 2d, the remaining three companies of the 34th, the 43d, and-the loyal 70th, whichlthe authorities, withthe treachery of the 6th before their eyes, probably thought ' doth protest too much.' Our 78th Highlanders, so lately facing Persian guns at Khooshab, and the companies of the 37th, brought up from Ceylon, superintended the proceedings. At Calcutta the native militia was disarmed and volunteer corps raised. The King of Oude was arrested, and his alleged complicity with the rebels may, if proved, somewhat affect the case which is being pressed at home by the august lady in the New-road. " Turning back to the North-West we pause for au instant in Oude to see the gallant and able Sir Henry Lawrence grimly busy in hanging the mutineers at Lucknow, with loaded field-pieces and lighted portfires on either side the scaffold, and to hope that there is no truth in the report that he has been forced to abandon the capital, and fall back upon Cawnpore. Pass rapidly through the Doab, nothingy new has happened to detain us, thoegh it will take an army from Allahabad or Cawnpore one of these days to restore it to tranquillity. Crossing the Sutlej we find, as I have already intL nated, Jullunder deserted by its native forces, the 6th Light Cavalry and the 36th and 61st Native Infantry; and Phillour vacated bythe 3d. Throughout the Punjab the flying column, of which the nucleus and main strength are the 52d Light Infantry, has been doing its wvork welL. No further outbreaks have taken place. Many mutineers have been hanaed or blown from guns at Peshawur, Ferozepore, Lahore, and Mooltan. Near the first of these stations the 64th Native Infantry have been disarmed; at the last the 62d, 69th, and a native troop of Horse Artillery. Of the march of the Bombay Fusileers I shall speak presently. "c It remains to consider the position of the great tract of Central India to the southward and westward of Delhi, with its numerous independent chiefs. Approaching this district from the north, I have first to note that the contingent of the Jheend Rajah has been doing true and loyal service under the walls of Delhi. In his neighbourhood are the British stations of Hansi and His4ar. Here the Hurrianah Light Infantry battalion has mutinied, killing, It ih feared, Lieutenant Barwell, and other European3. The levies of the Rajah of Bhurtpore, to whom was committed the charge of keeping open the road'1 between Delhi and Agra, proved faithlews, and their offlcers, Captains Nixon and Munbee, of the Bombay army, scarcely regained Bhurtpore with their livee. The llwar IHorse are, it is feared, equally bfl. Tue Kotah ,ntingent waat the latest- dateatil, loyal, posted between Agra and Mutrra with two guna. Of the United Mailwa; Cwoningent the cavalry regiment has gone. Despatched, the headquarters of it, from Mahidpore to follow up ancd at tack the Neemuch mutineersi itoelf mutinied, slew its officers-Brodie and Hunt-and, returning to camp, endeavoured, but in vain% to indace the infantry and artillery to follow theie example. The other wing stationed at Indore abandoned their quarters, but without committing any act of vib Iknoe. Ajmere is afe, garrisoned partly by the fly ing Bombay column from Deesa, party by the Mhairwarra battalions. The deserted station of Nusseerabad has been reoccupied by the Bombay Lancers. But what is Scindia doing? This is a qumetion of grave moment, and one not readily to be answered at present. We knew tha the 7th Infantry Rvegiment of his contingen; rcutinied at Neemoch. We krnow that the telegraph wire has been cut near Seeprec, and all regular communication with Agra, beyond Indore, interrupted; and we have reason to believe that both at Seepree and at Augur the regiments of the contingent have risen. Indeed, T know that fears are entertained in the best informed quarters that the whole of the contingent (which consists of four companies of artillery, two regiments of cavalry, and seven of infantry) have turned against us, with the exception of thle companies which gprrison the isolated fort of Asseeghur in this presiciancy. Then, what wil Scindia do? Will he be allured into beleving that our power is on the wane, and into declaring against us, or will he, at the head of such troops as may remain faithful resist the strong temptation, aud oppose dis loyalty even to the death? Like his fathers before him, he is a sturdy little alahratta; he is young and active, riding his 50 or 61) miles a-day when necessary and energetic, too, as he showed on one occasion, when his then newly-raised Artillery hesitated to fire upon a body of the old levies who had refused to disband. Scindia jumped off his horse, seized a lighted portfire from the hand of a gunner, and himself discharged the first gun. Such a man, with the command, moreover, of considerable treasures, has the staff in him to work us much good or Ill. Indore, the seat of his rival, Holkar, is perfectly tranquil, and is likelv to remain so. The Britizh station of MThow, in its immediate neighbourhood, is garrisoned in part by the head-quarter wing of the 1st Bengal Cavalry, of which the other wing mutinied at Neemuch. It is, however, safe at present aud the approach of the Bombay column from Poonah will probably keep it so. " With this sketch-hasty indeed, but I thin'k tolerably complete, and I hope, with the aid of a map, intelligible-I quit the Bengal Presidency and turn to those of Madras and Bombay. The chief, perhaps the only danger to be anticipated by the Government of Fort St. George is a rising in the Nisam's country. One regiment of that Sovereign's contingent, as we shall presently see, has showx itself disaffected, and been punished accordingly, but one only; and the Nizam himself is, in all probability, too much overawed by the powerful force cantoned at Secunderabad, close to his capital, to entertain a thought of revolt. At Kamptee, in Nagpoie, a regiment of the newly-raised contingent showed unpleasant symptoms, but the regular Madraa troops are there in force, and are thoroughly to be depended upon. Indeed, the want of sympathy between the Bengal and the Madras armies amounts to positive hatred. I read the other day in an English paper of eminence that the division of the whole force in India into three distinct armies is "1 a clumsy anomaly." That may be so; but the clumsy anomaly had the strenuous support of no les able a man than Sir Thomas Munro, and I much question, whetheit has not in this emergency saved Inaia. 'The separate army of Madras remains perfectly stanobc so does the separate army of Bombay. The latter, indeed, from its position in regard to the disturbed provinces, is able to give something more than a mere pausive display of loyalty. Not only have Lord Elphinstone and his councillors had the prudent temerity to despatch to Calcutta two ou of the four English regiments on the Bombay establishment, but on three several points in Central India and the Punjab Bombay columns, each comprising a portion of native troops, have marched, and with the best effect. The 1st Fualleers and the 1st Belooch battalion have proceeded up the Indus from E:urrachee to Mooltan, portions of the Queen's 83d and the 12th Native Infantry, with three Horse Artillery guns, have reached Ajmere from Deesa, and General Woodburn's column from Poonah is advancing upon Mhow. The progress of this latter corps up to this time may be traced in some detail MaUigaum, on the great high road from Bombay to Indore, was the rendezvous for the troops of this column There is stationed the 19th Native Infantry, and thither pr - ceeded the 3d Cavalry of the Hyderabad Contingent from Aurungabad by a bad crossroad of 100 milts, which, however, they got over in a couple of days. So far all was well, and General Woodbarn, with his dragoons, 25th Native Infantry, an I Artillery, had reached Ahmednugger fromPoonah oir their way across country to Malligaum, when he heard that the 1st Cavalry of the Hyderabad Contingent, which had succeeded the 3d at Aurungabad, was in a state of mutiny. So, instead of tu,ning off to Malligaum, he took his troops straig t on to Aurungabad, attacked the mutinous part f the regiment, some 150 in number, dispersed them, and captured about 60. The ringleader, a notei native officer, was hanged at once. Whether any others were executed I have not yet heard. Fr3m Aurungabad I imagine the General will proceed to Mhow by the Ajunta Ghaut and Burhampoo-, calling the troops at Malligaum across the country to join him before leaving. I IWe havenotbeen without our little alarms either in Bombay, or in Poonah or elsewhere. But no out break has taken place (for the Mahomedan riots at Broach some time back, though ending in bloodshed, arose only out of a local quarrel between that peop'e and the Parsees), nor did any sensible person doubt the fidelity the native troops, but only the temp.r of the loose population of the bazaars. At Poonah, the station was patrolled nightly by parties of the 14th and 12th Lancers. At Sattara, a man employed as a peon or chuprassie in Government em- ploy was apprehended and handed over to the authorities by a party of the 22d Native Infantry, with whose loyalty he was endesvoaring to tamper. He was hanged, " game" to the last, and uttering passionate bursts of dsl affection. A troop of the 14th and a company or two of the 3d Europeans went down from Poonah to aid the 22d in case of a rising in this important and so lately inadependent Mahratta city. " A few words before T close this long letter as to the steps taken to obtain additional means of ccercion. The lef t wing of the 86th (County Dowins) is comning over here from Aden to join the headquarters. Two of the Peninsular and Oriental steamers still in the Government employ have left for the Mauritius to ask for the loan of the 5th Fusileers, or for the 33d, if it shall have reached the iWland, If 'This request is refused they go mri to the 4ape to see whether Sir George Grey can spare us s! regiment or so. The troops on their way to China will, iti is said, be stopped at Singapore, with consent of Lord Elgin, and sent up to Calcutt. The whole prems of India has been placed b7v an Act that ha1 recently passed theLegidative Council under a censorship-a tp imperatively called for by the indecent and disloyal manifesta- Ions .of joy at our: difficultiew which appeared in some of the native prints at Caloutta. Here there hm been, to my knowledge, only one iisiFance of the kid, and the writer, a swoundrel of a Parsee, re. ceived such a rating from our superintenbdent of police-an iron functionary equal to the occadonthat he is not likely to offend ag "GeneralOutramhasreturnedwi.thColonelLugard and other Staff officers from Bushire, and tie Perxian prisoners have left Bombay for that post. Lord Blphinstone is here, hard-worked, but well; tne Commander-in-Chief of India is still at Poonah. Sir Patrick Gran', by the way, has arrived at Calcutta, and taken command of the Bengal army. The late Colonel Chester is succeeded by Brigadier Chamberlain as Adjutant-General, and he, again, by Colonel Nicholson, another of Sir John Lawrence's strong men. " The monsoon has set in at last, but this June faR is much below the average. Little doing in the import or export markets. The money-market is becoming somewhat more easy. Exchange on London, 2s. 2id." (From the Bom-ay Ti2mes of July 1.) It is extremely difficult to oompres within the limits of our summary the details whioh have reaehed us in the last fortnight concerning the mutiny of the Bengal army. It must suffice to say that the rebellion is Universal in that division of the Indian forces, and thbt it hbas been thought necesary to disarm the very corps (the 70tih NAtive Inftry) which was publicly thanked by the Gover. nor-General in person for its loyalty only thrse weeks ago, while the 6th Regiment Native Iufantry at Allahabad, which had rivalled it in its expressions of attachment to the Government, has risen upon its officers, and foully murdered them. It is with deep rafi-ation that we turn for a momeut from the consideration of these painful events to notice the fact that not a symptom of disaffection has appeaed as yet in the armies either of Madras or Bombay, which manitest the most perfect loyalty in the presence of this dangerous example; aud which repel Indignantly every attempt that has been made to seduce them from their aileglance by emissaries from the Bengal troopg.

The following are the stions at wlica the troops have broken out into open Tiolence up to the date of our advies :- *reerut *XNu raeeabd Jullundur *Delhi *Nemuch dAzimgbur Ferozepore Benares Fattebghur IAllyghur c1snai Jaunpore Roorkee XEIsaar B3reilly Murdaun Jhanal *Shahjeh=npot Lucknow Mehidpore We have indicated by an asterisk those stations atwhieh the women and children of our countrymen. ha;v fallen into the hands of the soldiery, and it is better to draw a veil over the barbarities they endured from these merciless fiends. At the remainder of these stations tho ofloers were murderously assulted, the bangalows fired, and at most of them the trasuries looted. Our columns will be found to oontain many detailed a4counts of the Meerut, Delhi Luolnow, Nusseerabad, and Neenuclt mamar, reported in few words by last mail, and we pas oiL to the eonsideration of the mutiny at Benares;- At 5 o'clock on the evening of the 4th the brigde was ordered out for the purpose of disarming the 37th Regl. ment, who were known to be disaffected and in correspondence with people In the city. The men were ordered to appear on parade without their arms. Some companies obeyed and did so, but others refused to give up their arms and commenced firing a their offioers. Tbis appeaed to be the signal, for the rest of the regiment then Jan to the bells of arms; the guns, however, bega to pour in the grape so sharply upon them, that they were lga to beat a retreat; only a few of the most determined rebels still kept up a fire from the right wing at the offioers. The Sikh Regiment all this time remained quiet o4 prade, pas sive spectstors of the socne, but at this crisi they loaded by order of Colonel Gordon. An ominous change then came over themr The cavalry first turned, and then 'With the Sikhs poured in a deliberate volley on the offioers stnd- ing around, three of whom felL The artillery in nrturn gave them a shower of grape, which sent them flying off the parde. About 100 of the mutineerg were killed, and 20D wounded; the rest bolted, throwing down their arms. The mutineers of the Sikh regiment tried to capture the guns, and were thrice repulsed with great los. Only a few men of the irregalar cavalry and Sikh regiment stood firm; all the rest mutinied; their discomfitur w as complete' thanks to the bravery of 180 Europeau soldiers, who de fended the guns, and charged and shot down the mutineers Eight only, instead of 35 as reported, of these brave soldier were killed and wounded. The lives of the civilians and their families who had taken refuge in the oollector's outchery were saved by the presence and noble exertions of Soorut Singh, a Sikh prisoner. He it was who went among the Sikhs of the treasry guard, and prevented them from rising after they had heard how the men of their corps had been cut up, and by his influenoe they were kept at their post until the next morning, when the treasure was removed to cantorments under an escort of Europeans. The portion of the Sikh corps over the treury remained stanch. Concerning the mutiny at HAnsiand Hissar of the Hurreesna,h Light Infantry and 4th Regiment Irregular Cavalry, we are without full particulars. Great atrocities seem, however, to have been perpetrated upon the cmnfortunate women and chitdren who fell into the hands of the soldiers. We have referred above to the mutiny of the lat Regi. ment Nizam's Cavalry at Aurungabad, which took place on the ltth inst. We are happy to believe that no Europeans were kdlled, however, and General Woodburn'a movable column, which fell in with the mutineers on the 23d, utterly routed and dispersed them. The mutiny of the Bhurtpore Levies, under the commnd of Captain Nixon, and that of the Valwah Contingent of Mebidpore, have come to supplement our difficulties. The former troops were supposed to be actuated by the best feelings towards us, forming part of the body ga rd of his Highness the Maahajah of Gwalor. " Immediately the news of the Neeimuch disturbances reached Captain Nixon he set out with the Bhurtpore Levies, accom- panied by Captain Gore lIunbee, of the Bombay IE.. gineera who, though senior in army rank to Captain Nixon, waived all etiquette in the mnatter and placed himself under that offier's command. They had only proceeded a couple or three marches, when the men refused to be taken against the mutinous Bengal Sepoys, uad set the Authority of Captains Nixon and Munbee at deflanee. These officers had to fly for their lives, and in doing so passed through districts where they were frequently fired upon by the insurgents, and, after many hair-breadth escapes, were fortunate enough to get safely to Bhurtporez where they now are, neither of them having, we rejoice to say, sustained any injury." The infantry and artillery of the Mal-iwahContingent are said to have remained loyal, the cavalry muthiying on the march to Neemuch and murdering their officers, Lieutenants Brodie and Iunt. At A.lahabad the mutiny broke out on the 4th inst.; when the " loyal" 6th Regiment, which hsd volunteered to proceed to Delhi against the rebels, only a few days before, becaae the assassins of their own officers, and then marched off to join the mutineers, after burning the church and every bungalow in the place, and looting the treasury. The whole number slaughtered amaonted to 26, and among them-we fthd the names of Captain Birch, the Fort Ad jutant, and the followhing officers -Lieutenant Ines,u x. Engineer; Lieutenant Alexander, 2d Light Cavalry; Captain Plunkett, 6th Native Inf attryy; Lieitennts Stewart and Hawes, dittoo; Esign Musro (doubtfl)); Ensigns Scott, Cheek Jhoodd, Smith, Way, and Smit-h (doing duty with the regiment). The Irregular Cavalry and PI, rorepore regiment are said to have remained loyl,and the fort being arisoned by a few English troops is probably safe. Not a European, however, remains outside the walls, and the last accounts from the city portray the moat frightful state of mattrs there. A correspondent of the Pkhrniz writesiS "A Alsbabad is in a most wretched state. Al the houses are In a dilapidated state from cannonading. Not a single bungalow has been left untouched, nearly all are burnt down to the ground. 'Upwards of 3,000 prieonera have liberated themselves, and are committing all sorts of ot-t rages. Not a single European or Christian reaains outside the fort. ItIis to be feared that few have escaped. Mr. Archer, the Commissioner's head clerk, is the only person saved in his and his brother's family. PeeroomuU, the great banker, has been plundered and his house Is in a most s ruinous state. The Dacoits have obtained their object everywhere by attempts at incendiarism first and while tke people were engaged in quenching the fire the dacoits made away with the booty. The way from Gopeegange and Jhoonsee is occapied by a class of banditti who have plun- dered innumerable people and made some of them return to Mirzapore withi a rag only on their backs." At Jullundur the mutiny brolke out on the 8th, but we know little beyond the fact that the rebels were driven otu of the camp with considerable loss, and were being puruLed and cut up by a squadron of cavalry, some European foof, and guns, and a body of horsemen belonging to the Allowalla Rajahb. A correspondent of theb Hsrka-u thus describes the mutiny of the 17th Regiment of Native Infantry at A&simghurgr "1 OnOthe night of the 3d the 17th Native Infantry, st tioned at Asicaghur, m utinied. An escort of 80 Sowars of the 13th Irregular Cavalry brought in on that date seven and a-half bcs of treasure from Gorrackpore; it was determined to continue its route to Betiares, where the presence of some companies of the 10th Queen' wou ud secure it to the Goverment. Some days previous'y the authorities- mliiitay and civil, had been occupiec in throwing up a breastwork round the -utchery. This, however, was notquicklycompleted. The escort and treasure moved about 6 pm. At 9 P p.. all the men in the lines some dis- tance frm the kutchery broke out, killed their quarter. master, and wounded the quarterm aster-sergeant so severely that he, wherever he is, cannot live; slightly wounded the h%vildar-major, nan kilied the kotwal of the city. The officer on guard at the fort at the kutchery hearing the shots, and having a guard of Picked and trusty men, as he thOught.turned them out, and desired the golandau nze to make the guns ready for business. They refused this, toldhimtley, would not fi re or allow the gu ns to be fired on the regiment, and that all the officers and ladies Would be spared; that they wanted the guns to get st the treasure, now some two hours and a half march a-bead.

Bank Stock closed at 215 to 217; Reduced, 909 to i; New Three per Cents., 90i to i; India Stock, 214 to 216; India-bonds, 250. to 155. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 6s. to Us. disount. - The flow of gold from the Bank is uninterrupted, a further sum of 47,000W. having been withdrawn to-day. The pressure for money has consequently increased, and the supply in the open market being altogether inadequate the applications at the Bank have been extraordinarily heavy. Should the demand continue with equal force 'for a few days longer an advance in the rate must be expected. Foreign securities have been in little demand throughout the day, and prices are a shade flatter. In Turkish, however, there was a slight recovery. No transactions took place in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed. Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cent&s were negotiated at 64; Mexican, for the account, 221 i; Sardinian, 89i; Spanish, 40 391; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25; Turkish Six per Cents., 94* 94; and for the account, 94* #. in the foreign exchanges, the rates for Ainster. dam and Hamburg were a shade lower; Paris was about the samne as last osat. The corn-market was dull this morning, but the prIces of Monday were maintained. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a good busmness at full quotations. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bonrse this evening were 66f. 65c. for money and 663f. 80c. for thepreaent account, showing a recovery of an eighth. The Government are understood to have commenced an inuiry regarding the causes of the delay in the transmission of the Indian telegraph from Trieste on Tuesday last. It appears that the message was despatched from Trieste at half-past 10 on that morning, and was not received here until half-past 12 on the following day. Twenty-six hours were thus occupied in a duty which ordinarily takes four. Meanwhile the news had been fuly received by private persons. If the latter had obtained it by the same line, a case of gross delinquency on the part of some one connected with the company would have been at once established, but the atatement is that the private message was received from Turin. It is to be hoped, however that the whole affair will be thorougly sifted. Probably the blame will be thrown on the Austrian or some other foreign officils, but even in that case it Wi be well for usto be aware of any impediments wilfully placed in orr way, either for political reasons or to suit the speculative purposes of these functionaries. According to some accomunts there was a disturbance from a thunderstorm,-a plea which may be true, but which can always be conveniently resorted to. On the other hand, should the suspicion be that the English directors or their servants cannot be relied upon for that strict reserve which is vital to the respectability of a telegraph company, the exposure of the fact will be most important. There may not be any imnnediate remedy but it will ultimately lead tothe formation of ila companies on a better basis, and meanwhile all persons in the money and other markets will be more than ever on their guard against sudden speculative operations. Advicea from Constantinople to-day indicate that Mr Giustiniani, of that city, who was tepoited 'to have atspended, is duly providing for all hls engagements. Mr. J. P. Giustixijani has noti5ied this fact to the parties interested in London, at the same time ex;pressng a hope that it may enable him to overcome the difficulties in which the house on this zide Las been placed. Subjoined is a table of the fluctustions in the stock and share markets during the past month. The range of Consols, which in the previous month was only 7 per cent., has been 2i per cent., and a I fall has been established of 1l per cent. In railway shares there has been less imsteadiness, and in a majority of instances an advance has been maintuined. The North-Eastern, Berwick, and York lines have greatly improved, and also Caledonian. East Indian have experienced a heavy decline:- FLi TvxTIO.S iV TEE STocx AND STAO S DUMIG THE MO.V1W or JuLy, 1857.

Accord. ing to report; the stock of specie now held in silver roubles is equal to about 24 millions sterling. At a meeting of the Electric and International Telegraph Company to-day, Mr. J. I. Ricardo, M.P..n m the chair, the report and accounts were unnmously adopted, and a dividend declared at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum. The chairman observed that the 3,3211. added to the capital account is principally for the extension of the telegraph from Plymouth to Falmouth. It was intended, inl the first instance, to wait for the completion of the railway between those places, but the inhabitants of Falmouth being greatly inconvenienced by the delay have sabscribed Among themselves 3,3001., the sum required for the work. In anwer to a question, it was stated that the Government dcspatch, in anticipation of the India mail, which was 26 hours coming frozn Trieste, was not forwarded through the company's line from Holland, but through the Submarine Telegraph Company'x line from the French coast. A proprietor baying complained that a private mesane forwarded to him from Trieste, throughthe Hague, bad been similarly kept back, the chirman obeerved that no neglect in transmision occurred on the part of the company; that the delay was attributed by the foreign authorities to a thunderstorm,which b1 taken place on some po,nt between Muni4 &nd Triefte.

A further soaroe of extraordinary expenditure has arisen from two additional lines having been laid down by the London and North-Western Railway. By theagree. net 'nwih atha e:ompany it was arranged that the wires of the telegraph were to be removed upon notice beingrfven; wthn requiiat for the englneening purposes o the line. The construction of a new line of railway which would necessitat the cornplete removal of the whole of the subterranean as well as the suspended wires of the company was a contlingency not contemplated at the period of entering Into the greement, and application has ac-cord ingly betn rnade tor eome compensation for the very serious expense-entailed-urpon the Blectric Telegraph Company. In tho meantime the whole OOst 'has been 4efrayed from revenue.

The directors hd, however th5 *onvic tion which the experience of the past half-yearlhs justiaed them in havinig foried, that, without any rducton of their accustomed dividend tJeir rceipt would be more than equal to meetadl the necessay outlay and it was in this assurance, which the event h3s shown tobe correct, that they -withdrew the Billanoanoed at the last half-yearly meeting for rasing money by preference stock, to which tey were at the tUine mot un willng to have recourse.

CHINA. (nox ot mCTT HEQNGKONG, Jmn & The Chinese fleet has been destroyed in two decisive engagements, but the sentiment of our navy has undergone an entire change in zespect of thmes "1iinid ' barbarian MIore Englishmenhavebeen klled sAd wounded In these two conflictG than wer disabled before the walls of Acre. The first expeditiona was under Commodore 3liott, and the 'operations lasted during the 25th, 26th, and 27th Of May. The second was under Commodores Keppl. and Elliott, oomanded by the AdmiraL il person. The first ' can only relate froi bOa*y..p. , fr I If you will refer to the smIl chart of tib'anton river, recently published by the Admiraljty, and whiob, so far as it goes, is very correct, ypu will see four creeks markled as running from the Cant6n river eastward. The northernmost of these i Es&cape Creek; next, to the south, is Tazekee Creek, wbhicol , in fA, but part of Escape Creek; about four. mile further to the south ix an entrance calli Second 1sr Creek, and four miles still southwards Is a larger nlet called Sawshee Ch=neL Only the mouths of these four hilets are' ked inthe ar, They were supposed to commun.ate witl h: otJhe,r further inland, but nothilg certai4`ws knowu upon the subject. About five miles up IsmpeC reek,azgp let Of Mandarin junks had lain for some tiu., cl a it wan thtthe operstions wer0 comme-ced- : On the morning of Monsy, 'he 'Ith" of A &;Ta, Commodore Elliott, l the. Hiongkong uoat, followed by ache Ri- ai,. the Stxaunc ihe Starlintg and the Forbes, and towing he boats and boats' crws of the Inflexible, the Eornet, and the Tribiue, s tiamed into the .creel, and came upon 41 X;andarin }unUi,. moored across the steam. Each was armed with a long 24 or 32 pound gun forward, and also with from four to sIx nine-pounders. The first shot fired after she got within range struck the Hongkong, and for Eome minutes the shot came thick aboard of her. The other gunboats now came up, And forming in as loose order as possible immediately opened fire. The junks stood for some time, and returned the fire with spirit. It requires no mall umouut of steadiness and courage to work that large exposed gun, rising in the bows of the junk and without a scrap of protectiQn to the man who fires it. After some little time confusion seemed to increase. They are all swift vessels, impelled by oars or sails. Several of them got under way and turned for flight up the creek. Immediately they did so they were comparatively powerless, for their tern guns were of smal ealibre and were not well served. The steamers pressed on in pursuit; but the waters shoaled. The gunboats draw from 7ft. to 7fr 6ilL; theae fiat-bottomed bandarin junks can float in three feet. One by one the stesm gunboats grounded, but the Coamodore's cry was, " Never mind, push on." They had towed behind them the boats 'of the larger ships. Quickly as a steamer got fast in the mud the men swarmed into the boats, manmed the gnu in her bows, and rowed off in pursnit. At last there was not a steamer afloat, the junks were in full flight up the creek the rowboats were in hot pursuit. It was hard worI4 for these ae swift vessels, and, with 40 Chinese pulling for dear life, they pass deftly through the hllow and treacherous channels. The guns, however, in the bows of the pursuers, told heavily, and when a boat did get alongside the crew always fired a broadside of grape, jumped out on the other sdde, Awari ashore, and wexe lost in thx paddy. fields. 8ixteea junks were thusaken, and des#oed, in the si reek een escaped by dint of tI rowing. The sun was tremendous, And cases of stun stroke were occurring among the men. One junk had in its terror turned up a little inlet to the right, and being followed was politely led out. A squadron of 10 went up a passage to the left, which is supposed to afford a shallow channel up to Canton. They were now, however, so utterly panic-stricken that upon being approached by four boats they were all abandoned and burnt upon the spot. Thus ended the first day's work. Commodore Elliott, however, was not satisfied about those 13 junks. He had suspicions also that there were a great many more in those creeks. The next day was employed in stopping the four bolt holes of this rabbit warren. Captain Forsyth in the Hornet was now left to guard Escape Creek. The Inflexible had her broadsides bearing upon the entrance to the Second Bar Creek Captain Edgell in the Tribune took charge of the Sawshee ChanneL All the points of escape into Canton river being thus closed, Commodore Euiott and his gunboats, with all the shipse boats of his squadron in tow, on Wednesday morning set forth to explore the Sawshee Channel. For 12 miles his gunboats found water-but found nothing else; but the Commodore saw a very remarfkable pagoda, which he had seen the day before when running up the Escape Creek, and he felt convinced that these creeks were all in communication. He also met a Chinaman who told him that four of his friends who escaped on Monday had got away to a town whereof this pagoda is the principal building, and which we now know to be Tung-koon. Abandoning bis steamers, therefore, he took to his boats, and after rowing for 12 miles between paddy fields rounded a point of the creek and found himself close in with the town of Tung-koon, and also with a fleet of junks (one of them of great size and splendour) and under a battery. The Chinese were utterly unprepared for this sudden meeting. The English boats fired all their guns, gave a cheer, and made -a rush; the Chinese jumped overboard without firing a shot, Now, however, came the worst part of the affair. It was necessary to destroy these junks, and it was desirable to take away the chief junk. But the boats were in the midst of a city. The crews of the junks established themselves in houses and fired upon the sailors with jingalls. The Marines were obliged to form and charge in the streets. The Mandarin junk was found to have powder upon her deck and trains communicating between her and the streets. Then a hoase close to her was met on fire, and up she went, nearly carrying an English pinnace up with her. Twelve large jiunk were here destroyed. The sailorg who bad no sails in their row' boats, having now done their work, hardly cared to pull back again. Sails, therefore, were improvized out of the mats and other spoil of the junks, and they came sailing down Sawahee channel in guise which might have puzzled the master of each ship to recognize his own boat. In this affair one man out of every 10 engaged was hit,-a large average even in European warfare. Such was the result of the expedition of the Escape Creek. I shall describe the battle of Fatshan in all its details, not only because it was the most desperate cutting-out affair that has happened in these waters, but also because it enibles me to describe at the esame time the theatre of our operations and the present position of the Britshforce in China. I have sent home by this mail a plan of the operations, and if Mr. Wyld -will publish it in a cheap fonn, and If peoplo . wil refer to it while reading my narrative, I believe I can make the incidents clear to them. It I do not it must be my own fault, for no one had a better opportunity of seeing them.

We were in close range for some time, but no Chinaman showed his eye over his gun. The channel contracts. Away to the left thereYs an unlimited extent of rocks, Shoals, and shallows; but1 the channel runsbetween two hills. Mdyidy betweem these high shores iepotwo green islets. At the bottomof thehillwhichformitheright handbank run two separate lines of embrasus, built of very large. stones, which are now knocked about in strange wonfudon. The islets have slar lines of fortification, which eircle their sammits like coronets. As we steam up between the ielets and the Shore I look with horror on the place. Here are four batteries, each having embrasures for a hundred monstrous guns, and all concentrating four ross fires upon. this very spot. Happily the danger has ceased. These are, or rather these were, the BogueForts. John Chnaman complains th&t wedon't fight fair when we from time to time take these forts. Instead of going up to them like brave men we send a few small sips in for l the grua to fire at, and when the guns are all at work somemarines and blue-jackets ieNp over the wall in therear anld drive the gunners out. The Chinese are of a practical snd reasoning murn of mind. When asked. why they ran away from a storming party, one otthem answered, in My hearing, " No can. Twopiecy man no can stand all same place. S'pose you must come in, I go out." F These Wantong islande are, I am told, to be -oo- cupied by a force of Mfarines expected to arrive bythe Sanspareil about the end of July. After passing this celebrated spot we come to a. larger Isand, called Tiger Island. It is a green hill and valley, but with no tree upon it. Here are Commissaiat officers laying plans for making it a dep6t for their bullocks. Major Kearney, lwho, as ASistant-Quar&temaster-General, has been a- sociated with them in this service, comes on board and tells me he here joins the expedi'ion oO duty, having it in command to report to his General the militarY character of the co-untry through which it may proceed, and its capabilities for purposes connected with his department. Poor Kearney! hle was every inch a soldier, full of zeal and hope; after a career of honour at Sandhunt, a youth passed in India, and many years lost in office duties at the Horie Cuards, the desire of his life was now about to be accomplished.
