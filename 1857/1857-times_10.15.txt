UtOZEi:Y-MABKBT and OITYIXTRLLI GBNWO. Wednesday Evening. The tone of the stock and money markets to-day as been as favourable as could have been hoped. Llt is still doubtful If the necessity for a further advance in the rate of discount will ba avoided, but there is an improved prospect in that respect, although the point wil mainly depend upon the ad-vices to be brought from New York by the Ariel. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 87i o g, opened this morning at 87i to i; and the con*nuaLce of a moderate demand for stock on the part of the public caused a steady recovery to 88k. -4reat sensitiveness, however, still prevailed, and a rather heavy speculative sale then caused a decline to 872, at which they remained to the close. For the 10th of November the last price was 88k to ;. The dealers were principally engaged in the settlement of the account, which passed off satisfactorily, although there was a full supply of stock upon the market, and loans on Government securities were in full demand for -temporary purposes at 6i per Cent. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 213; Reduced, 86a To .2; -New Three per Cents., 802 to 87; India Stock, 207 to 209; and India Bonds, 30s. to 20s. discount. A purchase of 10,0001. Exchequer-bills was again made on public account, and the last price was 10s. to 5s. discount. The pressure at the Bank for discounts was -again extraordinarily heavy, but the large advances which became repayable there to-day were well mnet. The total amount of the dividends the pay,ment of wvhich commenced this morning is abou 'U,000,0001., and the proportion usuaUy taken on the iirst day is about 4,000,0001. The tendency to a restoration of confidence wai anuch asGisted this afternoon by the announcement That about 70,0001. out of the 2G4,0001. of Australian gold bri,ught by the Red Jacket has been taken ,Jo the Bank. It also transpired that the doubts as to the correctness of the large estimates of the 5pecie to be sent by the Baltic to New York were -well founded, the total shipped by that vessel being only 72,6001. There was an absence of commercial failures of -any great importance. A report was widely circulated in the afternoon of a very heavy stoppage at MEanchester, but it was wholly discredited among ali -the leading firms connected with that place. The house of Affileck and McKerrow, Scotch warehousemen, and also that of Mr. W. B. West, wholesale haberdasher, were stated to have suspended there, but their liabilities are not supposed to be very great. In London the failure has been notified of DIessrs. Scarratt and Partington, woollea ware-liousenien. The foreign stock-market has been qjuiet, with a limited amount of business. A further advance took place in Turkish, but it was not maintained to the close, and the last prices show little alteration from yesterday. Mexican were negotiated at VI , 19, 18i, and 19 ; for the account, 19. ; Portuguese, 43; Spanish New Deferred, 25 and 24 ; Turkish Six per Cents., 87l, 87, and 87, ; for the account, 87k; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 97, 971, and !)7; French Three per Cents., 6li1; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 941 and 95i. The corn-market was dull this morning at the -rates of Monday. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were -IGf. 90c. for money, and 07f. 10c. for the end of the month, shovwing a recovery of three-oightbs per eent. At Vienna there has been a fall of 1 per cent, The rate of discount is stated to have re-cently rantged from 12 to 18 per cent., and the failure has been announced of M. Boskowitz, a large commilission merchant at Pesth, for 250,0001., ollowed by that of aeveral minor firms. At Amn. sterdam the Bank of Holland are stated to have advanced their charge for discount from 5i, at which it was fixed on the 8th inst., to the unprecedented rate of G per cent., while the Bank of Ant. -werp have adopted an advance of 1 per cent,namely, from 3i to 4i. The news from India establishes the hope that the area of disturbance so far as regards the com2nercial products of the country will not be extended Jaeyond its present limits. An estimate may therefore be hazarded of the degree to which the aupplies of the various articles wili be affected 'The leading exports from Calcutta to Great Britain, France, and North Aiuerica coinsist of indigo, sugar, saltpetre, silk, cotton, rice, hides, safflower, jute, linseed, mustardsoed, cutch, and lae dye, and the aggregate value of these in the Indian market, reckoned at the present prices, may be taken at about 9,000,0001., ths distribution being about 6,200,0001. to Great 3Britain, 1,100,0001. to France, and 1,700,0001. to the Urlited States. Indigo, sugar, silk, saltpetre, and cotton are the Tmost important, but rice, mus1tard, and linneod, jute, and saMflower contribute con.siderably to the amount. The question is, what is the propr)rtion of the cultivation of each in the dis-aflected districts. Of sugar about one-half the total quantity comes from the neighbourhood of Benares, and the production will be proportionably interfered with. Silk comes principally from the Lower Provinces, and will tberefore not be much infltlence. Saltpetre will suffer greatly. The only kind suitable for gunpowder is produced in Bengal, and of this two-thirds are obtained ,rom the districts in revolt. Of cotton, also, about from one third to a balf is supposed to come from the same region. Indigo was already affected by -the occurrence of a short crop, and as from a quarter -to a third of the annial production is from the 'pper Provinces, a failure of supply has been anticipated, suchI as to act powerfuUy on an advancing market. At tbe last dates extreme apprehensions were felt with respect to the stock of seed for next season, Lower Bengal being principally sown with seed produced in the disaffected districts. The production of tice is a point that bears upon the native population miore than upon the external commerce cof the country. The quantity shipped from Calcutta is not unimportant-its value, perhaps, being about 400,000!., and, as its cost of transport is heavy, little would be likely to be brought to the port at a time like the present. The gzand point of anxiety, however, concerning this staple must be with respect to the crop available for consumption around the scenes of isurrection, aud fears are entertained that in many localities famine will have to be endured. Safflower and jute are cultivated only in Lower Bengal, and will therefore be safe. The cutch exported from Calcutta is not a native product, but comes r ,e" £.ac ye is not an important Item as regards aggregate value, but it is obtained principally from the disaffected parts. Hides also constitute only a saall item, and they are produced generally throughout India. On the whole, there geems reason to anticipate that the extent to which the production of some articles may be interfered with may reach an amount lvhich would be about equal to 10 or 20 per cent. upon the total value of the f ntire exports from Calcutta; but, as in the two most Important instances-fine indigo and saltpetre-. there are no competing countriez to make up the deficiency, a rise in price bas occurred 'which will cause the pectniary results to the Indian producer to be nearly the same as if the crops had reached an average. The only serious pressure, therefore, that India is likely to feel from the insurrection is that Mvhich may result from any destruction of the rice and wheat required for the food of the people, and there is cause to suppose that cases of this sort will be only local and limited. Commercially it is Europe and America that will suffer, from being compelled to economize the substances that must fall short. lndia will still take our gold, and will consequently -be thoroughly in a condition to pay for the conse-quences of her own disturbances, although among ssome persons there seems to be actual anxiety that an Imperial loan sihould be granted to her, even 7before she asks it. So long as any amount could be rased in the country such a course would be utterly impolitic, while it would also establish the worst p,ossible precedent with regard to our other possee- sions. Annexed is a table giving a general view of tbe statistics referred to:- State-ent of some of the leading aaticles of export from Calcutta to Great Britain, France, and North America for 12 months ending the 31st of July, 1857, and 12 siionths endi,,g the 31st of July, 1836. showing the extent to which, during the last two years, the supplies of these productious have been drawa from that marlet. It is fearedi we ctnnot depend upon Calcatta receiving any of the p.oduce of the disaffected districts to the north and vvest of B,nares after July until tranquillity has been restored there.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARBS. Wednesday Evening. The railway-market has been steady, and in some cases an advance has taken place. London and North. Western, Mlidland, and North-Eastern stocks improved; on the other hand, Great Western and Lancashire and Yorkshire receded, and a heavy fall occurred in Caledonian, caused by sales arising from the failure of a proviucial broker. Grand Trunk of Canada and Geelong and Melbourne advanced; Ceylon were rather lower. After official hours au improvement took place in East Indian. French ahares were generaUy higher on the receipt of higher prices from Paris, from orders to purchase baving been sent froni this side. American descriptions, though actively dealt in, show no alteration. The transactions in mines have been unimportant; North NVheal Basset and United Mines receded, and there was an advance in St. John del Rey. Joint-stock banks continue flat. In miscellaneous securities there was a good demand, but a decline took place in Australian Agricultural, Electric Telegraph, National Discount, and North of Europe Steam.
FUPST, SECOND, OR TIIIRD PERSON ?-An amusing interlude took place in the course of the speech of the hon. gentleman who moved the reply to his Excellency's address in the House of AsseNbly on Tuesday. This gentleman, touching upon the subject of educetion, came to this burst of oratory :-" Sir, we must educate our children."

A Dublin daily paper which is generally supposed to reflect the political views of some of the Irish exofficials of the Derby Government of 1852 has rather suddenly come to the conclusion that Orangeism, either as a religious or political institution is no longer called for; that the necessity of such a confederacy has passed away, and that its old and objectionable name should be merged in the general term of Conservative. How the ultra party wtll relish this piece of friendly couneel time alone can tel], but it needs no gift of prophecy to foresee that the voice of the charmer wrill hardly pierce the ears of the majority, gentlo or simple, of those for whose guidance the advice is volunteered. After pronouncing a general condemnation upon the Uhancellor's letter, the Daily Bxpress proceeds to eay:- "Will the Orangemen bear with us while we make an appeal to their own good sense as to the policy and exyediency of such an institution as the Orange Society in an age like the present, and under a constitution which is the admiration of the world ? The objects of the society are two-fold-religious and political-to uphold Protestantism and to uphold the constitution. The former object it pro. poses to accomplish by cultivating a spirit of Christian fellowship and brotherly love among the members. Viewed in 1his light it would be easy to show that Orangeism is unscriptural and inconsistent with Christianity. It ignores and virtually supersedes a divine institution. The chutrch of Christ is the means divinely ordained for the cultivation of Christian fellowship, not the Church of England ex. clusively, but the organized 'congregation of faithful men,' wherever they are fotnd. If the church does not accomplish its object in this respect at present, it should be reformed and reviewed. uertt it is that no selfappointed body has a mission to do it. If a divine institation has faUed in producinga spiritual result, shall a human institution succeed? By what right, divine or human, does tbe Orange Society impose an oath to bind the oonsciences of Christian men ? Is it not a first principle of Protestantism that no authority but the authority of God can bind the conscience ? Is there a single religious duty enjoined by Orangeism which hba not been enjoined by Christ inthe New Testament ? Is it assumed that His authority has failed to enforce those duties and toincalcato them through the means which le has ordained in His church, and hence the necessity cf a merely human institution to do what the ministry and the church cannot accomplish ? No. To assert this would be something like blasphemy. It would be turning away from the 'fountain of living waterI to a broken cistern, which can hold no water. Yet this, in our judgment, is the fair logical deduction from the very existence of the Orange Society, so far as it aims at religious objects. Establish missionary societies to extend the church-strengthen, purify, enlarge it as much as you can, but do not establish a human instito'tion wit-in it, or beside it, having the same objects, but bound by laws, and vows, and obligations which are wnere humau inventions and human devices, and thensay that withoel this human institution Christiau truth would perish from the land. This is not Protestantism-this is not the way to uphold Protestantism. How has Protestantism been revived and spread through Ireland during the last 30 years?? Eas it been by the Orange Society, or by societies based on O-ange principles? Not certainly by the Orange Society. On the contrary, we fear that our home missionary operations of every kind, and particularly the conversion of Roman Catholics, have been impeded by the obstacles which Orangeism has unwittingly thrown in the way. This language may be unpalatable to some of ouLr readers, but it is the truth; and the thne is como when the truth on this su>ject must be spoken, at least by that portion of the Conservative press which is free to give it utterance. Equally untenable in principle is the Orange Society as a polital institution. We are told that its object is to up. hold the constitution. Bat what is the constitution ? All government exists for the protection of society and every society is bound to uphold the Government-to lieave It to the work for which it was ordained (and in one sense Government is ordained of God), and while the Government exists no portion of society is justified in taking the law into its own hands. Our Government is not despotic, but constitutional-that is, society governs itself through a lilited monarchy, a hereditary peerage, a representative Parlianient, a responsible Executive, independent tribunals, trial by jury, and a free press. We pay for a standing army and a large police f orce to watch over us, and protect us night and day, that we may be at liberty to mind our ovn business, and may sleep in peace. If the work of protection be not done as it ought to be done, we have the remedy in our owvn hands. We caa return right men to Parliament, and the House of Coimmons will compel the Executive to do its duty. We can remonstrate, petition, hold public meetings, agitate until we get the evils corrected. This Is the way to uphold the constitation-not to arm ourselves, to meet in secret societies, and to combine against another class of our fellow-subjects. This is the first step to anrchy. It tends directly to the disruption and dissolution of society. It is a libel on the Bntish Constitution to say that it requires to be aided by a perpetual ' Vigilance Committee' like the Orange Society. In 1798, and in 1848, when an attempt was made to overthrow the Constitution, such a body as the Orange Society could render essential service acting under the Government as special constables. But It should only be provisional, temporary, ceasing with the danger that called it forth. A permanent political organization, armed for the defence of the country, antagonistiC in principle to a large portion of the people, unknown to the law, uncontrolled by the Executive, is an anomaly which it is utterly impossible to defend. There is not a sound political principle identifieK with Orangeism which Conservatives cannot maintain as well without it. 1he people of England and Scotland do not forget William IIl., or the glorious PRevolution of 16S8, though they do not annually celebrate the battle of the Boyne. Hacaulay is not an Orangeman, yet not even Lord Dungannon has done more justice to the ' glorious, pious, and immortal memory.' There is one thing connected with Orangeism which we hold to be utterly unworthy of the free, manly, independent spirit nurtured by Protestantism and the British constitution, and that is its secresy. Why should Protestants have anything to say to one another which they must whisper in private lodges as if they dwelt in a land cursed by despotism and rspioncac, dogged by gens d'cu-rj ? Why should honotrable, high-spirited gentlemen and bravehearted yeomen stoop to the self-imposed necessity of communicating with one another by secret signs and passwords ? It is with unfeigned respect, in the spirit of true friendship, in the interest of Protestantism nd of our oountry, that we submit these considerations to the attention of the members of thc Orange Society." In reference to thia singular manifesto from the Irish Derbyite camp the EBeniing Mail, the old organ of Conservatism, thuis speaks:- " Signs are not wanting-a very significant one will be found in an extract from a morning journal-to show that the ship of Irish Protestanti8m is about to be lightened by casting overboard the Orange and Presbyterian portions of the freight; but t,e attempt to trim to the Castie gale will be unavailing, and unwilling as the Protestants of Ireland unquestionably are to engage in a new civil conilict, they will certainly not be influenced ether by force or fraud, by open attaok or by deieraiou, to separate from one another, or from the old standard of freedom." Oi'E?-AIR PREACHeING ti DELFA.ST. People at a distance believed that the open-air preaching in Belfast had been discontinyued, and thsat both parties had consented to a temporary truce to hostilities. The oNeslester, however, as one of the champions of Hannaisna, shows that the crusade is atill beindg as actiely carried on there as It was during the most palmy days of riot and confusion . ltaweainethap g that some change has lately taken placeinote vweather, yet, as yesterday was very fine for this season of the year, soveral ministers of different denominations availed themselves of the opportunity of preaching In the open air to large congregations. The Romish organs of this country endeavourwd to midsead the pnuol by represeating thae street preaching has been put down In Belfast, but w e are happy to be able to announce that never had wre so many oen services as since the opposition was showvn by the mob of the Pound. We noticed on this day week that seven sermons had been preached in the open air on the previous day, and we have now to state that no less than cine were preached yesterday," Meanwyhile, it seems that the doings of the Ultramontane party in Belfast have alienated from the fRoman Catholcs the support and sympathy of their old friends among the Liberal Protestants. The Mercai-y, an organ of the latter, says: " They have manifesated a spirit of bigoted intolerance, in which the Roman Catholic gentry throughout the country happily do not participate. The 'tprinciples of civil and religious liberty' that once flowve so glibly from thdir tongues nowv appear to be alienatedi from their hearb and foreign to their actions. They seek to revlve the ran- corous animosities of olden 'times, nd to excid; pre- judices we bad hoped were for ever buried in oblivon. Such being the case, they need not wonder at the result. Liberal Protestantism has suffered mush, and gained abeolutely nothing, by political alliance with them; and it is full time that such an association, in whic'h there is neither honour nor advantage, should be dissolved. This Is a conviction that is forcing itself more and more every dwy on the Protestant mind, not of this town orly, but ofthe empire at large. The whole policy pursued by the extreme Roman Catholic party of late years has nr other tendency than to deepen and strengthen that conviction. Here in Belfast, that policy has displayed its spirit by very revoiting manifestations, and this business about the oagistracy is one of them . As long, therefore, as we find a sectarianism detestable in spirit and dangerous to the peace of soodety, reveaing itself, as it has done of latew among us, we shall continue to expose and denounce it.", THF INDiAN RaEiis BtD D. The following letter from the Lord Bishop of Down and Connor was read yesterday at the meeting of the Dublin committee:- " The Palace, Holywood, Belfast, Oet, 10.

The Be7fast Newsletter has the following:- " I have to acquaint you that one of the most dreadful murders that bas taken place in thia county for many years occurred here on Saturday evening, about 6 o'clock p.m., at the Diamond, near Dromore, the unfortunate victim being Mr. John Alexander PRankin, Aughneskeagh, near Dromara, grocer and dealer. It appears the deceased Was returning from Dromore fair on Saturday evening, and, on his way home, some words baving passed between him and a young man, a Mr. William HaLnna, of Gransha, a sewing agent, it Is alleged the latter drew a knife and thrust it into his unfortunate victim. Medical aid was sent for to Dromore, and Dr. Hawthorne immediAtely proceeded to the scene of murder, but ere he reached the spot the deceased had ceased to exist, having only lived for about two orthree minutes after he received the stab. Thedeceased was a most respectable young man, and connected with some very respectable families in this neighbourhood, who will be plunged into the deepest grief in consequence of this dreadful murder. The police at this moment (9 o'clock p.m., Saturday evening) have not returned yet; they are in search of Hanna, and it is hoped they may succeed m their endeavours to have him brought to justice."

REGISTBATION& CITY OF LON"loxN aur. x Y. t'UHRITrE yesterday continued the revision of the lists of household voters for the various parishes of the City of London in the Court of Common Pleas, Guildball. Mr. S. Smith and Mr. Ledger appeared, as before, for the IUberal Association. ]n the parish of St. Mary the Virgin, Mr. Lee, the official assignee of the Court of Bankruatcy, claimed to be inserted upon the register in respect of ofices in AldermanburT. upon being examined in support of his claim Mr. Lee said he had occupied the offices for three years and had pid 1301. a-year rent. HIe had made a cLaim to be rated in December She Assistant-Overseer was unable to say whether Mr. Lee was rated or not. The REvisqaC BAnnisTER thought that if proper inquiries were made by the parish authorities persons woald not be so often exposed to the inconvenience of having to attend the Registration Court to prove their claims to the franchise. Mr. Lee's claim was admitted. No other point cf public interest arose during the day. FIXSBURY. Mr. T. F. Macqueen, the barrister appointed to revise the electoral lists for the borough of Finsbury, held a court yesterday in the Lords Justices' Court, Lincoln's-innfields. In the parish of St. Andrew, Holbora, and St. Georeethe-Martyr a great number of names bad been objected-to by the tax-collectors upon the ground of non-payment of taxes. Mr. Hammnond, on behalf of the ovorseers, said the parties objected to had all duly paid the taxes due up to Micbaelmas, 1856, but the tax-collectors bad made a demand for a balf year's taxes due on the 20th of March. The RZvIsINQ BARRISTER said the Act of Parliament required that payment of all taxes up to the 5th of January preceding should be made on or before the 20th of July. Mr. Hammond explained that in all these cases the parties had paid the taxes due at Michaelmas, 1856, in due time, but the Queen's tax collectors before the 20th of July made a demand for two quarters' assessed taxes due on the 20th of March. The demand was made upon a printed form, but the overseers believing that as the parties had paid all the taxes which were demanded of them prior to the eth of January, 1857, they were entitled to be placed upen the register, had inserted their names upon the lis' The learned B.sisaRR1ST asked whether the point now raised had not been considered by him a year or two since, and Isis opinion respecting which had been confirmed by the Court of Common Pleas . Mr. Hammond believed the cases to be quite similar, except that in the present instances there had been formal demands made by the collectors before the 20th of July. The Court of Common Pleas held that taxes were payable quarterly, although they were only collected half-yearly, and that it was the duty of the party claiming to have his name placed upon the register to tender the amount of all taxes due. In the cae now before the Court the demand wss made for taxes due on the 20th of MArch, and therefore the parties had been misled by being induced to believe that there was nodemandupon themfor taxes due prior tothe 5th of January. The overseers had placed the names upon the register this year as upon a former occasion; they bad been threatened with legal proceedings by persons whose names had been omitted under similar ircumstances. The REySisLG BziRRisTER said the point was a delicate ene, which required careful consideration, and he should wish a correct statement of the facts to be prepared. Mr. Hammond explained, that although a quarter's taxes were due at Christmas, yet the collector did not demand them separately, but included in the half-year ending 20th of March. The point had been raised il the case of :3medley and Ford, hut there was a variation in the present cases, from the circumstance of the collectors having maie a formal demand. The Collector informed the Court that the demand made was for two quarters' taxes, and therefore gave the parties notice that one quarter was due at Christmas. The Rxvisiso BARRISTIB asked if proper notice had been given to the persons objected to ? The Vestry Clerk said the objections had been published upon the church doors. The learned B.\RRisTER thought that some notice to the parties through the Post-office was required by the Act. The question, however, required consideration, and he shonld postpone his decision till Monday next. 1S T1EE PARISH OF ST. LCKES, MIr. Thomas Sinclair appeared to complain that he was omitted from the list The Vestry Clerk said the reason for the omission was that the claimant's name had been returned by the tax collector as not having paid his taxes. Mr. Sinclair thought he; had great reason to complain, as this was the second year his name had been omitted from the register. He had tendered to the coliector the amount of Queen's taxes due, excepting the income-tax, which he withheld, being desirous of appealing against the assesSment, but the collector refuned to receive one tax without the other. The learned BARRISTER thought the case was a hard one, and asked whether the vestry clerk could give any explanation? The VeE'ry Clerk said the overseers could only act upon the information which had been furnished to them by the collector, who in this case was the applicant's brotber. The IEvisisNr BAnR1sTBs regretted to be obliged to refuse the application of Mr. Sinclair, but he had no power to interfere, as there had been no claim. IN- rTE rA-RISH OF ST. MART', lSI.NTOTNs, The Vestry Clerk dreaw the attention of the Revising Barrister to the circumstance of the list having been made out according to the different wards oi the parish, instead of being included under one arrangemient. From the great number of voters in the pariah it had been found more convenient to adopt that course, and the only question was whether thore was any legal objection to it. The House of Lords had decided in Scadding's case that various parts of A book formed one book, and the magistrates had always held a rate charged upon separate divisions oi the parish to bo one general rate. The Reform Act required that "an alphabetical list" of the voters should be made out, and he (the Vestry Clerk) submitted that the list now prepared, although arranged alphabetically for each ward, was, in fact, but one list, and therefore as iU compliance vwith the Act of Parliment. The learned BARBISTzI asked the Retrning Officer his opinion upon the point, Mr. James (the Returning Officer) sai?d, personally he thought the arrangemen nowr adopted was a very convenient one, wrhich would materially facilitate the process of taking the poll a,t elections. The only question was, whether the Court wouh hxold the lists ot the eight wvards to constitute one entire list for the parish. The Vstry Clerk sabmitted that there wa only one list although for the sake of convenience it had been divided. The REVIsINGo B BUsTR said he had made some inqulries upon the point, and as he found that two of his predecesors had allowed divisioas to be made in the lists, and as there was no objaction upon the present occasion, he should treat the liss as one hi the aggregate, and revise them accordingly. The lists were then received, and the remaining busine s was disposed of without the ocourrence of any mat -r vorthy of public notice.
A WIFE COMYLuTRfED TO PRiSON FOR THRASIIIN;. HER HUSIN;D.-At the West Riding petty pessions at Leeds, on Tuesday a brawny'looking countrywoman, nearly six feet in height, named Caroline faigh, was charged with baving on the 2d inst. assaulted her husband, who pre. sented a very marked contrast in sature and general demeanour to his spouse.

LONDON, THUBSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1857. The Eastern theory is very complimentary to human wisdom in the colleetive form, though it mingles this bias with much that is quaint, formal, and traditional. It studies the picturesque. If a certain number of old men or sages with long beards sit for a certain time round the four sides of a room, it is supposed that as a matter of course some great truth wiU be elicited, that some valuable maxim wiU be laid down for the guidance of mankind, some signal addition be made to the science of morals or politics or religion. The Eastern mind is wonderfully trusting, and what it principally confides in are external demonstrations. These are allpowerful with it. So, if the proper outward show takes place-if there is enough of it-if the form and ceremonial agree-if the place of meeting is solemn-if the sages are properly selected, and with reference to the hereditary principle, their fathers and grandfathers having been sages beforo them-if they sit in proper order-if their speech is duly slow and their countenances are unexceptionably grave and venerable, it is supposed that something must come out of such a perfect deliberative scene. How can the end not be attained when the necessary mears are taken ? Faction would be a logical fallacy under such cir, curnstances, and mistrust would be foolishness. Perfect wisdom is to the Oriental mind the result of regular means and methods, the inevitable reward of gravity in synod assembled, of hair sufficiently long and white, of order, state, aund seniority. The MrUSTAPHAS, HAssAtNs, and ABDATrAHs have thus handed down this precious heirloom from generation to generation, of the genuineness of which the existing condition of the Eastern world is the triumphant evidence and test. It need not be said that the Western or European theory of wisdom is very different from this, and is very far from showing so confiding and submissive a temper; and least of all does such a theory as this flourish in this country. It would bo injustice to ourselves to eay that we have no organ of veneration, but we do not venerate by rule or by book; we have no technical note or test of the venerable; we are not prostrated in awe before a long beard, we do not make wisdom a matter of ceremonial, dignified utteranco, and grave looks. We do not imagine that the most imposing sitting or conclave can produce this result as a matter of course. Our theory is a more irregular one, and we think that truth comes up to the surface in a much more haphazard and loose way than this,-that it springs up here and there, we hardly know how, by means of sudden thoughts, chance observation, hints, gleams, flashes, surmises, presentiments. This supposes, of course, a state of mind in a community prepared to take such messages and follow them out ; but, that general intelligence taken for granted, we regard discovery as a coy, casual thing. We do not sUppose that we can coax or flatter, or threaten or coerce it ; that we can, by meeting in the largest room in the most populous town, compel science to utter one single oracle. We have no hope of subjugating her by chairmen, committees, boards, sections, and that sort of machinery. We know that we must wait for her, and allow her her own times and seasons. In her own time the Goddess who is to bring us hope and confidence and knowledge will reveal herself. And our theory of wisdom, we apprehend, is on this very account n-,t only truer, but at bottom more religious, than the Oriental one which we have described. We cast our bread upon the waters, and hope to find it there after many days, but we do not expect by solemn talk and sitting round a table to strike out truths upon the spot. We leave that issue to the action of that mysterious light in human nature which, under the direction of PROVIDENCE, Comes Up to the top in the shape of sudden rays, darting irregularly here and there upon the gloom, like welcome visitors, for whose reception you are prepared, should they arrive, but whose arrival at the actual time is unexpected, and fills you at once with joy and surprise. Of what use, then, is theNational Association for the Promotion of Social Science, which is now holding its first meeting at Birmingham under the presidency of Lord BROucniAwr? Do these gentlemen expect, like Eastern cross-legged sages, to discover truth by sittings, by formal deliberation in sections under chairmen ? They will probably say that they do not expect any such thing. The use of such aniual meetings as these can be only to register and to publisb, in the most convenient, pleasant, and usefully exciting way, the ideas, discoveries, and results of thought which have come up to the surface in their several departments of social science during the year. Lord BROUOrA.u remarks, with great truth, that mankind have generally much more taste for facts than Xer. metaphysics, more talent for observation, of 'htak is without than analysis of what is within them. Well, then, with respect to jurisprudence, public health, education, and other subjects, facts are constantly coming up which somebody or other observes, and which may be made use of as contributions to a basis of knowledge upon which practical improvements may be founded. This Association supplies an annual opportunity of collecting such facts, and putting them into shape. "Established institu" tions," says his Lordship, "measures for adding "to their number or extending their scope, at"tempts to modify some, or to alter, possibly " to dispense with, others, monuments of legislative "4 wisdom or error, enactments regarding crimes "and their punishment, measures of police, "judicial proceedings, and acts of the State in "executing the laws, are the facts which the "political reasoner generalizes, and on which he "builds his system." The Association for the Promotion of Social Science is founded for collecting and publishing facts in the social domain, as the British Association was for collecting facts in the scientific. Of course, some divisions of the social science wfil be much more fertile of facts than others. Lord BRoUGHAM appeals to the succe3s of the Law Amendment Society, and tht many improvements which have been made in our code upon the basis of its observation. This is an active and lively department, then, in which a vast quantity of new matter will doubtless constautly be coming up. On the other hand, with respect to education, we seem to be already in possession of aU the main facts. We know perfectly what the obstacles to progress here are. They may be mentioned in two words, and, with all deference to the solemn conference which took place on this subject a month or two ago, we do not think it informed us of much which we did not know well enough before. But why have a monster association ? The Law Amendment Society has been working all this time successfully by itself. Why cannot a " Pub' lie Health Association," a "Reformation and 'Punishment Association," an "Education Associ"ation" each collect its own facts and publish them at its own annual meeting ? Lord BxoUoGAar anticipates such a question by assuring us that the five departments of social science which have been selected as the domain of the Association are a selection out of a larger nwunber, so that the Association, comprehensive as it is, does not include the whole of social science. We are glad, we confess, to be told this, otherwise -we should have thought there was very little left out of the domain of the Association, and that it did embrace almost everything that was connected with hu-man society. But the age likes monster creations of sUl sorts-monster palaces, monster preachings, monster music. This Associalion, it cannot be denied, is rather of the order of monsters, so far, at least, as regards the capacity of its stomach and the extraordinary quantity of matter which it has undertaken to digest. But it may be said, on the other hand, that the same kind of people take interest in all these subjects; that tbey aU like to meet and see one another; that a large meeting is an event and has a coUecting power; that it is difficult to draw the line between meetings which everybody. goes to and meetings which nobody goes to; that the alternative is very apt to lie between one or the other of these two extremes, and that the former is the preferable one; that one large meeting saves railway expenses and saves time. These considerations have their force; a comprehensive and capacious association is, perhaps, the most effective one, and certainly it could not have been inaugurated by a president more in keepillg with its comprehensive character tban Lord BRorGEoAs, whose speech, we are glad to see, maintains so effectively his Lordship's old and great characteristic of universality.
The circumstantial though succinct delineation of affairs in India received at the East India-house on Tuesday last contributes a complete confirmationi of the intelligence transmitted by the earlier telegrams, and enables us to extend our deductions on some points of material importance. The ultimate safety of Lucknow appears now placed beyond reach of doubt, for it is officially certified that the garrison was in good condition and well supplied with provisions on the 2d of September; that it had been encouraged to hold out by direct notifications of approaching relief, and that this relief was actually on the road between Allahabad and Cawnpore on the 3d or 4th of last month. We hope therefore that the suspense and anxiety of the nation on this point may now be dismissed, and, as the Agra garrison is represented as not only secure but powerful enough to take the field against the rebels, the lives of our countrymen in the East are probably no longer jeopardized by the ferocity of their treacherous enemies. The most comprehensive, however, of the inferences suggested by the last despatches relates to the conduct of the native Princes of India. The general reader may hardly be aware, perhaps, of the extent to which States of tnis character are still preserved under the supremacy of the British Government. We are usually supposed to have pursued the policy of annexation with some degree of rigour, but, although the dominiions under our immediate control have certainly been augmented by escheats and confiscations bringing large territorial acquisitions to the Supreme Government, the number of chiefs still enjoying a qualified independence, and secured in the undisturbed possession of very considerable domains, is quite large enough to prove the general tolerance or continence of our rule. In the NorthWestern Provinces alone, and in the districts directly adjacent, the Princes, established in Governments of greater or less importance, with armies of more or less significance at their command, were numerous enough to at once turn the scale against us at the commencement of the insurrection. It must be remembered that when the traitorous Sepoys, after breaking out into overt mutiny at Meerut, raised the standard of military rebellion at Delhi, our force in those parts, disproportioned in itself to the strength of the enemy, was still further weakened by its almost complete isolation. The troops forming the only British army in the field against the insurgents had been drawn from Umballah and Simla, and were joined by the Meerut division as they marched by way of Kurnaul to Delhi. But for these necessary operations there was at that time hardly any sufficient or practicable base. Neither UmbaUah nor Meerut could answer our demands in this respect; for, though the latter place represented a considerable military station, it offered fewresources, and, in fact, the great North-Western arsenal of the Government was Delhi itself-the very city we were besieging. At the moment it was not known that the Punjab would be secured to our cause, and, moreover, its authorities and its garrisons were mainly at the remotest extremity of the province, on the Affghan frontier. The Punjab itself, too, is by no means conterminous with our North*Western Provinces, where tlle rebellion was evidently localized. Between these districts and the Sutlej, which forms the eastern frontier of the Punjab, a system of small States was interposed, known in Indian nomenclature as the Qs-Sutlej States, and governed by native PrineQ, of Sikh extraction. It is obvious that on tha loyalty and friendship of these chieftains our wul,nunications with the Punjab would depend. To the Ncrth, again, were the Hill Rajalis, eaoh with his quota of power, tq be exeroisnd for our benefitL or dis- advantage, while in the more immediate vicinity of Delhi, and throughout Rohilcund and the Doab, a considerable body of Hindoo and Ma. homedan Princes disposed of more or fewer resources in their respective domains. It is not a little interesting to observe the almost uniform fidelity -with which these chiefs | preserved their allegiance to the British Govern- |iaent. Had it not been, in fact, for their signal and active sympathies we could never have established or maintained our position in the face of I the mutineers at Delhi. That we should eventu- ally have reconquered the territory is true enough, but except for the aid of the native Princes at that critical moment we must, in all probability, have lost Upper India for the time. The communications with Calcutta, it should be recollected, were then interrupted, and, indeed, Calcutta had no succours to despatch. Reinforcements from the Punjab could only arrive after some suspense, and then through the co-operation of these native States, so that the force before Delhi depended virtualy for its resources on the Nabobs and Rajahs of the country. That in some instances these chiefs should turn against us in our adversity was of course to be anticipated; but, as a rule, and in the great majority of cases, their behaviour left nothing to be desired. The Rajabs of the Cis-Sutlej States threw themselves at once into our cause, lent us the aid of their retainers for forage and escort duties, kept open our com1-munications with the Punjab, brought provisions in abundance to the camp, and effectually protected our rear. The Plajah of JnEEND not only added his Ihandfulof troops to ours, but actually marched atthe head of his owvn men. The fidelity and good offices of the Rajah of Pu TEEALLnH aredeservedly eulogized, as our readers wil observe this morning, in a communication on the best authority, and intelligence we have ourselves received enables us to confirm this testimony to his extraordinary service Hle has relieved us of an infinity of dut:es, and discharged them with marvellous success. His country intervenes directly between Delhi and the Punjab, and its resources, -very considerable in extent, have been placed unreservedly at our disposal. " In fact," says one of our correspondents, writing from the spot, "whatever we have not "got, or don't know how to get, we ask "him for, and he must somehovr or other "supply the deficiency." Even money has been advanced to us largely by these Cis-Sutlej Chiefs, tbough, if the truth is to be confessed, our previous dealings with them in such matters were not characterized by very great generosity. If we extend our view to territories somewhat more removed from the principal scene of action we fnd the same prevalence of sympathy and the same rarity of disaffection. In Rajpootana the native Princes are certainly giving no countenance to the insurgents, and, to all appearance, are faithful to the British Government. The Malhratta Princes, SC nMIA and HOLKAR, have pronounced for us, and are to be credited, perhaps, with the tranquillity still announced from Central India. In Bundelcund, also, we have received the aid of the native Lords, while from Cashmere our ally the late GoILAB S-Non, whose policy is maintained by his successor, promised us some 3,000 troops and 750,0001. In direct contrast with these features of loyalty and good service we ought to place the general treachery of the " Contingents," or forces ralsed from the resources of these native chiefs, but orgauized and offilcered by ourselves. These troops have in most cases mutinied and joined the insurrection against us, while their immediate masters remained faithful. Wherever, in fact, we created battalions like Sepoy battalions, they behaved in the same manner; wherever the native chief appealed to his own private retainers, they followed him to our side. They might not present specimens of high military excellence, but their services to us as auxiliaries have been invaluable. It was a " Contingent" force which has just given the most recent example of mutiny in the little Mahomedan principality of Bhopaul. It has been eagerly questioned whether we might not have had the large resources of Oude also on our side had we allowed this State to preserve its native character under our protection; indeed, the annexation of Oude and the suppression of this conspicuous Mussulman State have been cited as among the most probable incentives to the mutinies in Bengal. It is impossible in the present state of our information to pursue these inquiries with any satisfaction, but in justice to Lord DALHOvsIs's policy it deserves to be remarkedas even our friends across the Atlantic have already discerned-that if the most popular hypothesis concerning the origin of the rebellion is well founded, the annexation of Oude, though it might have precipitated the revolt, has certainly tended to deprive it of its vitality. If we assume, as is now generally done, that the outbreak, at the bottom, represents a deep ard long-planned Mahomedan conspiracy, designed for the restoration of the Mahomedan power, and only adapted, for the sake of the opportunity, to the ferment of the Sepoy mind upon the cartridge question, it is clear that the explosion might have burst upon us at any moment, and that a King of OuDn, with a large army, a rich treasury, and a numerous population at his disposal, would have furnished the revolt with a far more formidable head than it has been now able to acquire. Perhaps, by the annexation of Oude, although we exasperated the conspirators, we robbed them of their most promising instrument. The foregoing remarks will enable the reader to appreciate the intelligence we yesterday published, and to comprehend how our position before Delhi, although our forces proved unequal to the assault of the place, has been attended with such remarkable advantages of security and abundance. We think, too, we may go one step further, and affirm that our rule in India cannot have been very defective in those qualities which cndear a Government to a people when we see so general a desire to preserve it. Of o-urse, we are not blind to the influpnce which mere political sagacity might be expected to exert. Doubtless, many a native chief in adhering to the Bruish has been adhering to the strongest, but the fact still carries its own general and weighty import-that the native aristocracy of India, like the native popalation, have no kind of desire to exchange our government for any government on a native model.
The Ministerial Crisis now going on at Madrid seems to demand a word or two of comment. Five and twenty or thirty years ago a change of MIinistry in Spain was reggarded with a feeling of interest which has since been fairly worn out. Even if the contest between the rival dynasties were renewed, this country at least would acquiesce in the decision of fortune without entertaining the smallest desire to interfere. The exertions which placed the "innocent ISABEI" on the thTone as constitutional Queen have not been rewarded by the subsequent progress of freedom; and; yet it is possible that they may not have been altogether wasted. Even the name of a riepresentative system has a certain value, as it doprives absolutism of the saWaction of law. Spanish courtiers and generals are compelled to assumne a revolutionary position when they take meawlres to promote that which over the greater part ou the Continent is kaoWn by the name of " order." The country is not altogether aead. NXIanoppressi onbecomesunbear4ble, or qwr3vption t3o scawWunm, the nation froza ti.AQ to time reasrerts its claims, and terrifies the Court into momentary concessions. If the only honert Liberal leader had possessed either spirit or sagacity Parliamentary government would already have taken fiLrr root in the Peninsula; but ESPARTERO is a second-hand LAFAYETTE, and more energetic rivals have always succeeded in pushing him from his seat. The Spanish nation has dibplayed an admirable instinct in abstaining from rebelling against the person of the Sovereign. The old English Baron 'was right in announcing his resolution to stand by I the Crown, though it hung on a buoh. IsABamLA II. is, againet her will, the symbol of some constitutional check on the arbitrary power of the BouRBoN monarchs. Her right depends exclusively on a vote of the Cortes, and her partisans defeated the legitimate Pretender in the name of the Constitution. Don CARLOS is, beyond a doubt, entitled to be absolute King, if Spain is an absolute kingdom. Succesive Ministries have always involuntarily acknowledged the conditional tenure of the Crown. Thcy have packed and bribed and intimidated their Parliaments, but they have never ventured to govern without them. It required all the charactenr,tic ineptitude of the virtuous ESPARTERO to prevent the popular cause from becoming triumphant only two years ago; but there would have been no liberal cause to defend if the Cortes had not in the worst of times gone through the forms of deliberation. The surviving patriots of the last generation may at least think with satisfaction that they have provided an uneasy seat for the bastard despotism which oppresses them. The reasons which immediately occasion changes of Ministry in Spain wi' not bear too curions an investigation. Since the time of Louis XV. motives so strictly personal have not infLaenced the delegation of sovereign power. There are always individuals at the Palace who can procure the dismissal of any obnoxious official. NA&nvAEz himself has been sufficiently long in office to possess many troublesome secrets, and his political importance renders him at all times odious to the courtiers, and not perhaps whoUy acceptable to their Royal mistress. W"hen he succeeded O'DowNELL it was fully understood that his triumph was accepted as an unwelcome necessity. His faU merely proves that his enemies have come to the conclusion that his resentment is no longer to be feared. In all these changes the interests of the country are confessedly forgotten. When the Court is powerful it encroaches; when the public indignation becomes too strong a few insincere professions of Liberalism satisfy the successful malcontents. There is a point beyond which even Spanish patience finaUy refuses to be strained. It is the amusement of the Court to venture as near the limit as possible. Only three years have elapsed since the rule of the SARTORIUS Mlinistry became altogether intolerable. O'DoNNxLL'S military revolt gave the nation an opportunity of declaring its feeling, and ESPARTERO was unanimously recalled from his retirement and invested with dictatorial power. For a time it was doubtful whether the dynaaty or the monarchical form of government would survive the convulsion; but Royalty, as soon as it found itself safe, waited with confidence for the inevitable dissension of its enemies. There were half-a-dozen constitutions in Spain of a more or less popular character, of which any one carried honestly into effect would have supplied a sufficient check on the prerogative. Instead of proclaiming one of these systems as the basis of hisadministration,EQPAnTxuo committedthe gross folly of converting the Cortes which he summoned into a Constituent Assembly; while the Government was occupied in talking, instead of discharging its proper functions, O'Do,-;NE saw that the favour of the Court might relieve him fr-sm his twaddling colleague. A second revolution effected within a few months raised liin to the summit of power, but he imprudently forgot that he had given unpardonable offence. Yet the leader of the Vicalvarist insurgents rejoices in the smiles of the QUEE.N. It was convenient to remind NARvARz that another daring soldier was at any moment ready to strike a blow for power. The stern Minister is now tired out with detailed opposition; but his rival sees the prize for which he has contended placed in more trtustworthy hands. If former experience leads to any conclusion as to the future, it seems reasonable to assume that the new Ministers will be still more subservient than their predecessors, until in the end the army and nation once more protest against the indignity of their political condition. Another democratic revolution may again be followed by a restoration; but despotism cannot alter a prescriptive right in the midst of constan' interruptions. The ultimate authority in Spanish politics seems to be the army, which is happily neither united nor decided in its policy. Scores of Generals are ready to offer their services for the suppression of liberty, but promotion may be gained on the other side also. After every fresh outbreak the successful party rewards itself with military honours and distinctions. If the courtiers are in possession of the government, it is the obvious policy of the armed Opposition to proclaim the supremacy of the Cortes. In this manner the nation oscillates between the two political extremes, and possibly it may at last acquiesce in some rational scheme of liberty. The new Ministers, with NARVAEZ and O'DoN\xELL excluded from power, must depend mainly on the Royal favour. After a time the Liberal party will once more coUect its energies, and perhaps it may obtain the alliance of the discontented Generals. Within five years a Cortes will probably be once more debating on the form of government and on the disposal of the Spanish Crown.

FRIGHTFUL COLLISION ON TEE SOUTH WALES RArLWVAY. PORT TALBOT Ocr '1 A fearful collison of two passenger traims meeting each other on this railway took place this day about noon betweer Pyle and Port Talbot. One child was fearfully mangled and killed on the spot, and broken limbs are unfortunately very numerous. The accident, if gross negligence can be so called, happened under the foUowing circumstance- The 6.30 morning train from Cheltenham to Milford Haven had arrived in due course at Pyle, a small station next to Port Talbot, and was about 10 minutes after its time. On arriving here a messenger brought the intelligenoe from westward that a truck in a goods train on the main line of rails-the Irish train proceeding to meet the packet at Milford-had broken down and blocked up the line. The messenger was accordingly sent back with instructions to return as soon as the line was clear, this not being a telegraph station. Before he hadreturned, however, another messenger arxived, and, having madle a communication to the stationmaster at Pyle, the train returned back along its ownx line (the do -n line) about a mile, to a crossing at a place called Stormy, where the Uynvi Valley Railway joins the South Wales. There the train crossed tG the up line, and then continued its journey dowrn upon the up line. Pyle was again passed, and the train had proceeded about a mile further towards Port Talbot, when the up-train, which left Milford at 7.5 and was overdue, was observed approaching at its usual speed on the same line of rails round a curve. It was too late, however, to avoid a collision, and the shock of the ts o engines was tremendous. Both engines, from their ponderoeity, retained their position on the rails, but the tender of the up-train was throwrn back upon the first carriage, a third class, which it mounted, crashing in the root and dreadfully mutilating the passengers. The tender of the down-train also was crushed back into the first carriage of that train, frightfully maisming its occupants. The scene of the catastrophe was frightful to look at, and to make it more fearful the up express train now became due, and its arrival was looked for every moment. The wounded passengers were, with some delay, got out, and laid upon the bank and every assistance rendered them that could he afforded under the circamstances Unfortunately, however, there was no medical man in either of the trains, but a yonng student resident near was quickly on the spot, and rendered valuable assistance until the arrival of surgeons from Port Talbot by a specia' engine in about an hour after the collision. One of the stokers was crushed in the wreck of the tender, and was with some difficulty extricated. The line was strewn with splinters of wood, broken iron, &c., and blood was sprinkled over the ground in several places, rendering the spectacle (together with the groans of the injured) horrifying in the extreme. As far as we could lear in the confusion incident upon the accident, the following is a list of the dead and seriously injured:- Robert Palmer, driver of the up-train, broken leg and severe cuts on the head. J. S. Lawson, fireman of the down-train, broken leg and Other injuries. Mr. Ashman, pork butcher, Cardiff, a frightfully smashed leg and other serious injurles about the head and face. It is feared his case will end fatally. The flow of blood was so great that, after forming a pool round him, it flowed away out at the door of the carriage in which he was placed for removal to the hospital. Mary Thomas, or Timmins, of Cardiff, broken leg and other injuries. John Prince, carpenter, Bristol, severe injuries on the back; incapable of moving. Mr. Brewster, printer, of Swansea, compound fracture of the leg and other injuries. This passenger had taken an insurance ticket, which fact he carefully communicated to his felow-passengers in the midst of his sufferings. Mr. Thomas Wiliams, draper, Aberystwith, internal injuries. Mrs. Cecil, wife of Police- Sergeant Cecil, of Cwm Ammo a, frightfulinjurles to the head. She was removed to Port Talbot, where her husband met her, and her case received prompt attention. Ann EHarman, a young unmarried woman from Neath, internal injuries. Sarah Harman, aged four years a fine little girl, who was travelling with her aunt, the last-named sufferer, was killed on the spot, her body being fearfully mangled, and blackened by the coals from the tender. - Sidwell, severe injuries about the head and face. A woman, name unknown, both legs broken. She was carried to a farmhouse near. An aged women, name unknowrn, internal injuries. There were also a great many other persons who had received cuts about the head and legs and contusions on various parts of the body, and in fact two-thirds of the passengers in the two trains were more or less injurtd. The above, however, are the most serious caees. As soon as a pUot eugiue had arrived from Port Talbot the wounded passeengers%who had been lyIng on the embankment close to the train, were carried into a goods van and a carnage, and conveyed to Port Talbot, aid thenoe the most serious cases prooeeded on to the Swansea Infirmary, where every attention was paid to them. Mr. Clarke, the general superintendent at Swansea, immediately on hearing of the accident proceeded to the spot, and in the meantime all traffic beteen Port Talbot and, Ple wras stopped. No doubt the most strict inve4i,gation wil take placs, aud it is hoped that the person who' ordered the down-train to proceed on the ap line will be prope-Ay punished.

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATIUIV BOR THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL SCIB'zVC. (PRO3M OU1B OWN REPORTErS.) BIRMINGIIAM, Wsi'.;Es5AY. The enthusissm of those who wish to promulgate a know. ledge of the principles of soil science is boundless. A" -oe stated in our despatch yesterday the aggreg.te body split up after the delivery of the Inaugural addressee, and proceeded to the bnsiness of the respective sections. The interesting and solemn ceremonial of the opering occupied a much longer period than was anticipated, aud a soiree and -other intellectual treats had been set down for the evening, 4ec that the majority of the members fondly hoped tha' after the labours of the day they might havo been dis'missed to enjoy a brief Interval of repose; bat the veteran President was inexorable, and with the trite observation that " time was short" he dismissed the wmembers of the various sections to tbeir duties. In the first depirtment, which compreherds JurisDradence and the Ainendment of the Law, and over which Lord J. Russell presided, a paper was read by Mr. E. T. Wakefield on the "Transfer of Land." In the second department, presided over by Sir J. Pakington, the attention of which is directed to the comprehen. sive subject of " Education," the Rev. Dr. Booth, chairsman of the council of the Society of Arts, read in detlil a very interesting report on the examination of the Society of Arts, A good practical paper followed from the Rev. Evan Davies, pncipal of the Normal College, S wansea, upon the "Education of the Middle Classes," and the proceedingi of the section were brought to a close by Dr. Hitlmphries, who read a not less interestirg paper upon the "IPlan and Objects of the Royal College of Preceptors." In the third section, whiah awsembled under the conjoint presidenoy of the Recorder of Birmiighans and Mr. Adderley, the all-absorbing question of " Reformation and Punishment" was dealt with, and a very interesting paper, based upon the proposition of " Crime growiDg with Denrity of Popuilation" was read by AMr. J. C. Symons, one of Her Majesty's Government School In- otors. Fe observed that the disparity between different riots in the matter of crime was enormons, and ho supported his view in this respect by copious extracts from Mr. Eedgrave's tables. He then argued that it was not true that crime was alone the result of utter ignorance; for it appeared that the relative proportions of those who possessed different degrees of instruction among persons coimniitted fir offences had stood thus for nearly 20 years,-namely, totally uninstrudted, 33 1 per cent; reading orwritiDg imporfectly, 53. *; reading or writing well, 5 4,; f superior instruction, S,; unascertained, 7*4. It appeated, therefore, that those who had received a smattering of superficial instruction furnished the bulk of crimuinals. After noticing the mueagre character of the education which during the last dozen years had generally been Imparted to the children in our common schools he passed on to remiiark that the census of education of 1851, compared with the crimiiinality of each corresponiding county, as soheduled by Mr. Redgrave, enabled him to put this to a statistical test. He had arranged all the English counties, together with Glanaorganshire (separately), and the rest of South Wales and North Wales, first in order of th,ir ignorance or dearth of schooling ; secondly, in the order of their criminality; and thirdly, in the order of their density of population ; and the general results he would submlit to the neeting. He found little correspondence between the ignorant and criminal counties. Those wlhich stood at the top of one column wvere sOU etimes near the foot of the other. On the other hand, when he compared counties as regarded crime and density of population he found the correspondenice most striking. Of the six most criminal counties-5liddllesex, Lancaster, Surrey, Warwick, Northumberland, and Staffo'd-none was among the six most ignorant, but every one, except Northumberland, was amongthe six most densely populated ; and the first four, comprising a population of 5),0tJ0,Wt0, stood in the same order, while there were no less than 24 counties (including nearly all the large ones) which aloim,t exactly corresponded in density and crimne. Of this whole category, however, North and South Wales, without GlJm'rganshire, which had peculiar industrial and moral features, stood loremost for ignorance, innocence, and sparseness of population. The crinminality of counties seemed also to be greatly determined by the rapidity of the increase of their population. Of the 12 most criminal counties those above named, together with Glansorgan, Darhain, Kent, Chester, Habts, and Monmouth, the increase in population averaged no less than 19 per cent. between 1841 and 1851, wvhile tbat of Eng. land and Wales was only 13 per cent. The omrverse held epually good. It wasa noteworthy fact that the chief industry in each was muineral. This -was a usefol index to another and one of the most fruitful causes of low moral condition. He meant a disregard of the phyRical agencies of civilization. In no phabes of labour wese the people so recklessly neglected as in mineral diAtTicts. The intermixture of the sexes at work, the total absence of the means of decency, and of that vital necessity, public baths, and the prevalenoe of dirt and slovenly squalor wvre painfully manifest in most of those districts, even to the casual observer. Such babits, together with the crowded dwellings and sleeping roonis, without se: aration of sexes or families, notoriously prevailed more or less in all densely peopled localities; and after carefilly anal) zing volumes of statistics, and testing all the generally alleged ssurces of crime, he had arrived at the conclusion that in whatever degree other causes operated densely packed comuitunities invariably generated crime in proportion to their density. and that in all such places the manifold preventives and coirectives of crimes ought primarily and inainly to be brought to be,.r. The remedies, Mr. Syrnons ob-erved, for the suppression of this increase of crime were the imnmediate repeal of that evil Act for the multiplication of beershops, the restriction of badly-conducted pttbllchouses, better paid and more efficient police, penalties uipon pubUcane having drunken persons on their prenises, sulfficient and well-organizsed lodginghouses under muniioipal and sanitary inspection, public baths ard wasbbhouses, and penalties upon keepers of lodginghouses for allowing intermixture of the sexes in sleeping apartments. A paper was then read by Mr. T. B. lB3AEsx upon "The Possible Extirpation of Regular Crinie ;" and the business of the section was brought to a close by a paper from Mr. A. HiLm. on "The Industrial Schools Act of 31 857." In the departmaent of " Social Economly," presided over by Sir B. Brodie, a paper was read by Mr. ]. Akroyd, iLlP., on "Employers and Employed ;" and by Mr. 3lastWorkhoun besalf of Miss Twining, upon the "Condition of TzE MMIDLAND I2eSTITUTY. Part of the Birminghazm and Midland Institute-a building which will when completed possess architectural features of considerable pretensions-was opened 1ast evening, and the opportunity was taken to present an address to Lord Broug am, oMust of the distinguished visitors now in the tow-n were present, together with about (10 of tho mombers and friends. ord Hathorton, V-resident of the Institute, was in the ohair. It mjay be rimemibered that the first stone of this building was laid by theo Prince Consort in -November, 18-a5. The compated cost is about 20,0001. The PMSorx:ENT, having congratulated those present on the completion and opening of that portion of the Institute, proceeded to refer to the exertions of Lord Brougham In advancing education-a point enlarged uipon at considerable length the address then read, a copy of which, engrossed u,pon vellum, was then handed to the noble lord. Lord BRottIuVAI (who stood during the reading of the address) expressed his thanks for the kind reception accorded to hIi, and thems proceeded :-I' is the kindness of my noble friend that has made him, I greatly fear, much overrate the services which I have been enabled to render, and when I remernber who oither preceded or accompanied me in the great work to which he has niainly ailluded-the education of the people-I have only to look opposito to my noble friend, Lord John Russell (cheers!, to be rominded how little I can be said to have stood ahlme in thai great work; for tbore was my noble friend year after year-not always successful, asl Iwas not alaavavs successfo l, in Cbtaining what he wanted and wished, but briligisg forward, both as a Minister and when out of office measures of the greatest possible moment for the promotion of that great object. Cheers) This war at perhaps a com parativ ely later period, ut ten am reusinded by my noble friend'r presence of his deeply and ever-to-be-lamented father, who was present at one or two of the very first nieetings that were held in founding -the British and Foreign School Society, and, according to miy present recolleotion of what took place 46i years ago, actually moved (if he did not ',ressde at that meeting) one of the first of its resolutions. lhat most emineht and most virtuous man, the true friend of the people amid of his country-I mean the late Duko of Bedford-persiswed to the very end of his life in prolmoting the same objects; and I nk the very last letter I received from him, a fortnight before his lauiented death, was to in,mplore me to give to the world a second edition of a tract upon popular education 'which I had addressed to hiim 10 d-ys or a fortnight before. Nothing can be more satisfactory than the opening of this Institution-than the ser,ic5s which it has begun already to render to the town, under she presidency of my noble friend, which I hope will be long continued. ((lear.) Let m.e add that it is none of the least of my gratification upon the present occasion to ntote the absence of all factious feeling or sectariau strife-a feature which I understand has marked 'he whole conduct of this institution frm-m its comnmenceMent to the present time (bear), which absence of all factious and controversial strife, whether of sectarian intole-ratio or of political bigotry, is teatifiednpon the present occasien in the kindly course you have taken by presenting to me this address, We have happily outlived all those factious excesses which did touch barm and brought no little .discredit on our country in fornier periods of her history. 'WA , b.V. -uia urvelte onyithsaewynwih We have survived th'em only in the same way in wvhicb. I do hope and trust our gallant countrymen in the East will survivo the authors of thobo as-scities at which aU the world now stands in horror and anmazeinentslurvivi;ig them by extirpating theum. (Cfieers.) liere it is necessary to use force for extirpation, li re tIme arms we emoploy in that servioe are sounder principJes and parer feelings than those we use to put dovn that wich is had in party-namely, factious violesice, factious exce-ses, f actious antoleranoe, whetherinmatters of church or of State, bot preserving that which is good in party -namely, the counbination of honest men to nnaintain conmmon principl-s,-prinOtples which they sincerely and purely catmrtain, ar.d do not take up for a purpose in order to gloss over some unworthy design, or to cover some selfish and sordid, interest. (Cheers.) Those are not the combinatiom.s of puny joined in by such men as my noble friends Lord J. lowell, Lord 3atherton, or as Sir J. Yakington, Mr. Adderley, and .others, whom I call party men, but who do not abuse their principles by carrying them to a vicious excess, and who d) not nierely pretend to hold these principles to serve a .pary purpose. (Rear.) I beg to express my feelings of gratitude for the kind reception you have given me, and my earnest and anxious hopes and good wishes for tho future .success of this great, and I think I may already call it, *without pretending to the gift of prophecy, this flourlshing institution. Lord STALEY said that wherever such institulions as this were found to exist,whatever the district or locality, and had ,continued to do so for a long term of years, it was only reasonable to suppose that their existence was proof of the general desire for them, andI that they wero calculated to supply a natural want felt by all parties. (Hear.) Such was his answer to those who contendeR that literary 'natitittios L#A &A wh9o, fNIod iu their object, (Hear.) It they had not been required they would not have been eatsi- blished in all parts of the country sas they were more than a ure fa cenitury aLgo; and if all the practical good w1hichU had bee npredicted had nobt come to pass (and in Emile essentials there had been great diversity of opinion in re. lation to them), upon the whole they haad done their work well, and no better proof could he offured of their great actual utility thani the existence of these inistitutions at the p resent day. Mere fashions, resting on no sonul0 sana solid basis, had their moment of succ&ss anid passed away; if they were not altogether deltusions, they conveyed the idea of imagnificent results, hut in reality led to nothing of the k-ind. (Hear, hear.) The permanent existence of institutions of this class was the best evidence that could be offered In their favoar. (Hear, hear.) No doubt, at, their first formation, miany of those who had been moat instruinentalin promnoting themi had beea over-sanguine in their ideas of sucemss, overlookcing obstacles which had ars n, oe of them of no ordinary character, many, in7.dee,o a graver nature than could have been anticipated. But this was nothing more than might be said of every great work, the re-sult of humian energy ; and, lookinig at the good which had been done,it was no part of their duty to point out the errors which mnight have been committedI by the founders of these institutions. (Hear.) It wyas very easy to see af ter the event what it was not possible to see before ; hut it was seenL very soon after these linstitutions were established that one of the causes of failure in many instances was the dependence for success on some popularity of the moment. (Hear.) Mer amusement was oftentimes put before instruiction the instruction offered was often of a wa'gue and desultory character; many persons thought that everything was to be done by merely attending lectutres; that, in fact, to listen was to learn ; and no definite course of teaching or study was required. (Hear, hear.) In all the princiLoal institutions theAleciure system was continued, but the mTsageinent had been altered or modified in this respect ;,they had now classes andl evening schools ; this, withi a disribution of prizes anbong meritorious students, brought such institntions as the present to an approxImation with the older pieces of education in the country. (Cheers.) The tendency of our time was not to exaggerate ideas of success, or to attach undue importance to results accomplished, but te mneasure success fairly, and to weigh as fairly the obstacles in our way, taking the means to do the best and overcome such impediments as presentedl themselves (Cheers.) He (Lord Stanley) was glad to see that ini this institution the necessity of a systeniatic course of teaching was fuxlly recognised, and that the systemn of awarding p.e had beeni adopted. He wvould saty to those conniected with the Institute, and to all its students, "1Persevere and you will succeed ; society Is with you." Ile very well remeombered a saying he heard not very long ago, in which there was a great deal of truth; it was that although it was a good thingto teach a man, it was of even more Importance to give him inducements to learn, and he believed that there ne,ier was a periodl when, there was so much to give asn iraretns to industry and talent as at the present time. (ERear.) A circumstance camle unuder his observation in L,ancoalhire a short time since which miight be taken as an illustration of this po. at. He went over one of the great industrial establishments, in which there were fromi 3,000 to 4,0(:O hands. He found there three men e-mployed as inspoetors or foremen, each of them in the rec~eipt of 1,5001. a-year, every one of them having risen from the ranks, and having been a working man in the samie establishment at a few shillings a week. When he (Lord Stanley) expressd his surprise at the Lsalary paid, and remarked that It was equal to the salary of an Under-Secretary of State, he was told that they could not akfford to give the men less, for that if they didn't giv it, oiihers would do so. (Hear, hiear.) He beieved that if the manufacturers of the north had rmade the most colossal fortunes, it was to a great extent the workl of the present century : and that the great element of their siuccess was that~ they began with nothing. (Hear.) There was a great fear expressed by some that in the present day men should be trained to something beyond their position, -so that in after life there would be no thtting scope for their exertions. For his part he believed that no more usieful work, could be done than to educate a man so as to givre him a higher sense of his intellectual being, and that there need be no) fear of raising up a olass dissatisfied with their station. The race was open to all, and thouagh there must he mrany failu:res, and many disappointments as well as failures, he had no fear but that the true English spirit of those whose lot it was to fail would keep them from either despnec or dissatisfaction, in the consoiousness that they haddone1cy well, and dleEerved. well, and bore no malice to those who had been successful. (Cheers.) Several prizes were then distribhxted amnong the pupils attending the classes of the institute, and, after a few words from Lord J. RVSSELL, who was loudly called for, the cernirony terminated. There was a soirvk in the evening at the Town-ball, -where the visitors and townspeople met to chakt over the proceedliongso the sections and the general prospects of theInsoaThssociato.Tefine organ was mande to discourse eloquently in the course of the evening by Mr. Stimpson. THIRD DA.Y. The sections met at 11. o'cloek, and proceeded at once to despatch the bumsiness referred to them. In section 4, wvhich related to public health, a paper on " the ILnfluence of Habitation on the Community" was read by Mr. W. H. MICIrAyi. The evils resulting proml overcrowding were (said this gentleman) augmenting. for our population is.creased at a. rate much miore than commecns,urate wvith house building. What, then, was to be done to check the onwvard flow of this tide of disease and crime ? The Public EHealth Act was iniefficient even where, it was in exercise. It wight prevent new buildings of the same character; it was powerless with the old.' It dealt with the apparent; it was too often afraid to touch the real, and it never could do its work efficiently for the public until the interior, a-s well as exterior of houses, were anniewhat unider the control of efficient medical officers, whose duty It should be to prevent, niot to cure disease. The truismi that `livery Enlglibhmanl's hiouse is his castle," maight Serve WEll to turn a period; buLt owners of property maust be taught that no property could beheld for private gamn at the cost of a great public vixong. This, however, and a great many, other truths the public were not preparzed to receive. :Sanitary reformers were loo'kedl upon by the great miass of the people as amiable enthusiasts. Mrany years also, it wvas to be feared, would be required to persuade the public that sanitary improvemients were the greatest boon it was in the Po wer of the authorities to bestow ; but until this public opinion was created legislation would prove, to a great extent, inoperative. But should it become general only to sllow two-thirds of property to be buiilt upon-to afford proper and well regulated inspection of houses, and generally to afford! efficient relief in the way of ventilation, drainage,ad water supply, it would be a noble result of the labu betwed in this cause. The Rev. 0. HAWNSIOWNE read a. pape on " Houses for WYorking Mlen, their Arrangement, Draiage, and Ventilation." In the conrs-e of his remarks the lecturer referred to the well-planned cottages built by the Prince Consort, particularly 20 in Windsor Crest Pack. Since 1851. Mr. Gore had caused upwards of 100 new cottages for laboerers to he crecterl onth lanlds belonging to the Crown. There were upon the Ducke of Northumberland's estate 592 bondagers' cotta-ges and 787 cottages for independent labourers. His Grace had extensively repaired and made equal to new 250 cottagges at an exppnse of about 551. each, and erected 210 new onts at a cost of 1201. each, mak-ingsa total outlay upon 450 cot'tages of the large sum of 52,7001. ; and large works of this Tind were still in progress Earl Spencer hadl erected 87 new cottages at a cost of 15,2201., or 1901. eaca. The Duke of Bedford had built in Bcdfordshire and Buckisghani 282 cottages;- in Devon and Cornwall, 190 ; in Cambridgeshire anc- N'orthampton, 72 ; in Dorsetsbire, 22 : mak-ing altogether 5611; showing an expenditure of (i2,li801., besides a lar-ge sum for repairs. The average interest paid upon the expendiUTue Oas those COttages WaS coir puted not to exceed 2.j per cent. Air. RUMS1AY reaLd a paper on1 "Density of Popuxlation and Localization of Dwellings." Were we, he said, to stop short at the palliative stage ? Could no advabce be made in a preventive direction ? Could nothing more te done than 'was doin6 so imnperfectly to remove the obvious and admitted cause of atniospheric vitiation--namely, the denisity of town popuilations ? The area of the London division of the English population allowed in 1851, on the average, 30 persons to the acrp, or 160 square yards to each of its 2 3629,000 inhaibitants Btut this average allowance of 'space gave little idea of the real crowding of particular distracts. rn the East London Union 290 persons were pressedl into an acre, allowing 17 square yards to each-shout one-tenth of the average metropolitan space. Even grouping the four central districts, the East and West London, the Strand, anid St. Luke's, the average was only 10 Yards to each. In, our par-simonious use of landl for btiildings we had neglected a most important sanitary regulation - namely, the separation of houses. It was a law of tlie Tw(-lve Tables, one in force during the best da"s of R-i',ne, that no two houses, whether the doinus of the' nobility or the insula of the common people, shouild touch. A space of not lesi than five feet was to he left between thein.; but in our great cities we were not satisfied with uninterrupted lines of houses, but prevented the possibility of p,setern ventilation by a dos d do3 arrangement. He argued thjat miore direct interference was needed on the parz of the State. Mfean while a great social crisis might occur; end when the timeo for modere rnea~aarea of prevention had perhaps passed the very persons who now cried out against State Inaterference would be the first to denounce the Uovern,nent for.past supineness. and to drive I into arobtrary and desperate measures. Sound political economy would, he believed, juAify national intervention iu this state of things. Such legislative provisions as were in force for aiding agricultural drainage might be applied to the adveuce of capital necessary for the erection of wellordered suburban villages. No expulsive process nor forcible extradition of the poor should be permitted in towns; perhaps not even stringent probibitory laws against undue crowding, however desirable their object, should be enforced until the State, or the capitalist under legal sanction, should have supplied proper accommodation for the scattered and houseless thousands. Even if large national advances were required for the Inanguration of such a reform, would a people which unhesitatingly sacrificed 20,000,0001. in one vote merely to shorten the duration of a colonial slavery certain of extinotion-a people which no less willingly spent 80,000,0001. in two years to protect a distant ally and to adjust a hypothetical balance of power in gurope-would such a people refuse a bold outlay to effect a thorough secial reform at bome,-a reform whioh must incalculably increase the happiness, socurity, and wealth of the whole community ? He could not bring himself to believe this. All that was wanted was tbe directive mind. Instead of expending million upon million in rendering densely-peopled districts more safely habitable, let the dispersion of the co-npresred masses be cautiouslyand gradually promoted. Let open and elevated s pot s, of good soil, climate, and water supply, be selected for occupation. Let wide streets of detached double cottages, not more than two floors ix height, be built oni there sites, so as to afford, on the average, 60 square yards of surface to each inhabitant. And to comnplete the project let railway transit ha provided (on fresh lines if necessary, and of a, simpler and far less exDensive kind than that nowafforde!) for the conveyance ot working people to and from the commercial depots or manufacturing establishments where they aright be employed. Under recentlyadiyavered economical processes, without reckoning on fr;ture improve. nents of this sort, the total cost of raj.way conveyance need not equal the difference betwveen t)e tret of a rural cottage and a set of rooms in some co-.,fined oity deleUing. Then wfould the city workuan pOS.ess his little plot of garden, the charm of the Engliti'. cottage, while hi ows vegetable prodace would botil economize and improre'the diet of his family. In the course of the discuaion which fouowed the reading of these papers Lord STANLEY (President of the Section) p)ointed out as a subject for considtration, as well as those which had been submitted, the indifference of the fornter clmast to ventilation. As affecting health, the habits of the inmates and their insufficient supply of food must be Iceked at, as well as the character of the houses in which they lived. It would not do to draw a contrast between the diffirent rmnber of deatbs among the rich and the poor, and then ascribe the diference to the over- crowded dwellings. Mr. A. HELPS pointed out as obstacles to improvemeutfirst, ourdire familiarity with things close to us and about, which seemed to require a continuous stream of talent, so to speak, directed upon them, to awaken and fix our attention; next, the tremendous ignorance generally prevailing on this subject; aud thirdly, the peculiar ignorance of members of Parliament. (Laughter.) He bad noticed wlth the greatest possible pain that whenever measures had been brought forward, prepared with great care and after long study, some person-probably a metropolitan member -steeped in ignorance to the lips, made some foolish objections, perhaps called the Minister Jaok Cade (laughter), and caused the loss of the measure. One practical suggestion he had to make; be was excessively anxions to bring before the public in sowe ^ay which they could not ignore the etrtets of a vitiated atmosphere. Was it not possible for soientilic men to invent an instrnmesit which should show the vitiation of the air ? If an instrument could be sluck up in the theatres to mark this in a way which would impress itself forcibly upon ths popular mind-as for example, that in the Princess's, it stood at 30, in the LIceum at 25, and so on-a great good would, we believe, e attained. Re would leave Greek scholars to invent a name for such an instrnment,-perhaps the stencbometer would do. (A laugh.) PeLple would soon believe in if, and even members of Parliament, with such an appeal to their senses, might perhaps be won over to believe in the existence of the evil which they were now considering. Mr. SLANEY, M.P., cautioned those present against encouraging tbe idea of too much State interference in the construction of houses. The MlAYOR. of IIULL (Mr. Moss) remarked on the obstacles thrown In the way of sanitary inmprovement by the remissness or ignorance of local boards of health, illustrating his remarks by reference to the borough with which he was connected. Mr. COWP'ER, M P., said the main difficulty experienced in sanitary leg.slation was not to prevent men from doing certain thuigs which they ought not to do, but to compel them to do something which they ought to do. Now, he very much feared that in the existing state of public feeling they would entirely fGil in enforcing a s3stem of cor1pulsion upon local bodies. lpcn these points they must trust to the common eense and the gradually increased knovledge of the persons charged with the local execution of sanitary arrangements. Mr. R. A usam; feared that raRiways could not be relied on for carrying the vorking classes from their places of labour to suburban residences. He believed that by properly constructed dwellings worokmen and their families migbt be healthfully accommodated In the numbers now found upon a given area in the metropolis. The system of flats in dwelings would be the true solution of the overcrowding difficulty. After observations from Dr. FAisR and Dr. CoNoLLY, Lord STANLEY observed, that though it might be thought they had great cause to complain of the conduct of many boards of health, still they were bound to remember that this sanitary subject was comparatively a new one to the community in general. A great deal of indifference, or what looked like inoifference, was really mere Ignorance. Information propagated itself very slowly in this country, and that very fact was in the end the best security for its permaneoce when established. As to compeDing local boards, except in the most extreme cases, to take upon themselves the responsibility of action, he agreed with his right hon. friend (MIr. Covper) that wqhether this w, as justif'able-on grounds of policy or desirabie in itself, it was simply impossible. Yeti might interfere by a general law to prevent a thing heing done, hit to compel a body of men to act against their own opinions would obtainl no satisfactory result. Pt'UIS2istNT ANMD REFOXSATIOfNO. Inthis section Mr. CAVE-, the hon. secretary of the North- West London RZeformatozy, read a highly interesting paper on the 1 Distinctive Principles of Punishment and Reformation." He observed that a meeting like that, composed of practical men, was valuable in correcting errors to which those who studied one subject long were prone ; that punishment was distinct from vengeanee, though often assuming its form; but that in operations of war, even, or such punishment as would be inflicted on the Indian rebels, thcugh the agents must be animated by fierce passions, the State which directed the operations should have in view the restoration of order and prevention of future ex. css. Still less should the State have a vengeful feel;ng towards its own subjects; the happiness of society was the aim of the Government. The first object of punishment was the acod of society ; but as the criminal was also part of society, the idea of punishment was imperfect unless it comprised his good. This end was to be obtained by reformation, which might be oouibined *with punishment, but In such a way as not to mitigate the sentence. The sentence should always be rigorously carried.out or uncertainty of punishment resulted, which was a great incentive to crime. Recording sentences as mere form, and all mitigation of punishment, should be abolished. There sbould be no sickly sympathy with crime. The ticket-of. leave system was bad because it made men hypocrltes. Hard but productive labour was the best discoiline; unproductive labour was peculiarly irritating. Some had proposed the measurement of the term of imprisonment by task instead of time, as inducing habits of industry. When sentence had been rigorously carried out, and the prisoner was discharged, the reformatory should be ready to receive him, His entrance there muat he quite voluntary, and the instruction there received might be a stepping stone from the prison to the world. But adult reform.- tories wero mere makeshifts and might be left to volunteers, The State must cut off the evil at the source, by the apprs. hension of criminal and vagrant chi'dren, who ought to he kept strictly for years at a reformatory schooL There was no injustice in this, or in making the parents pay for this detention; it was for the good of society, and of the children themsel:es, and had long been done in America. However many mistakes we rmlght make, the vnselfish attempt to ameliorate the condition of the lower clsses must be beneficial to the character of those who made it and to the nation at large. In the evening the Mayor entertainEd Lord Brougham and the leading members of the association at dinner at Dea's Hotel. Any detail of the proceedings which may be desirable must be left till to-morrow.
SonTcAirTroN-, Wedneday.-Tbe Bremen ,teamers Eansa, 2,500 tons, Captain Gherkin, and Germnania, 2,:0O tons, Captain Neynaber, have arrived at rhis Fort, consigned to Mesers. Croskey and Co., for the purpoec of being tendered to the East IndiaCompany for troop service. Tho Hansa formerly ran between Bremen and New Yoilk, and was then named the United States; and the Ger. mania was formerly the Acadia, of the Canard fleet. Both vessels are now 1)ing in our docks. The brig Franklyn, Captain Charles Henry Tupman, bound from D.raerar,e to London, laden with sugar and runs, put in here this morning leaky, with top sides and deck strained considerably bulwarks and stanchions carried away, loss of iibboom and rigging, and other damage, sustained in tbe gales of the 7th and Sth inst. when in lat. 47 30, long. 10 W. TEtE REQENT HEAVY GALES.-The extent of the havoc occasionled by the gales which occurred during the latter part of last week is now being ascertained. The ship. ping off the French coast suffered severely, and several British vessels, with their crews, were lost. The foundering of the Butijadingen, London and Bremen steamer, in the North Sea, during the late heavy weather, was annoucedyes. terday at Iloyd's. Happily, the whole of her passengers and crew were saved; they were landed at AIargate on Tuesday. The Butjadingen was a powerful three-masted iron screw steamer, and wyas built at Shields three years since. Tbe Empereur steamer, from Newcastle to Rouen, which went ashore near Fecamp on the night of the 9th, when eight of her crew were drowned, is stated to be a total los. This was the first voyage of the unfortunate vessel, which was of a peculiar build, suited to the ravigation of the Seine. On the coast of Ushant twvo English vessels were lost, with the whole of their hands. One was the bark Symmetry, laden with fruit from the Mediteranean, supposed for London, and the other the Adventurer, laden with wine from Cadiz to Plymouth. The gales swept along this part of the channel with great fury. The emigrant ship Stebonheath, Captain Conrell, which left Plymouthi a few days since with 3iaO Government passengers for Sydney, is reported to have put into Bordeaux, beimg unable to make way against the gale. A number of vessel were driven towards the French coast, and took refuge in Brest and other ports. The loss of the American shin Werden, from Newport for Cuba, in Barnstapie bay, ol the morDing of Thursday, is reported by Captain 31asher, the commander. He and tbree of his crew were the only ersons saved. The number of men who perished was nine. Several ships have arrived in the Thames, havin, su.tained ,onsiderable damnage in making their way up channel dariag the gales. THX LAST DAYS OF THE MAN 0HESTElR Exa I nnrri Ox. -The attendance on Tueeday, the last shillirg dsy, was the most numerous yet recorded, amounting to 9S,84 persons. Yesterday a well-organized attempt was nmade to get uip a requisition to the committee to keep open the exhibition another week. Sheets, with printed headings, were simultaneously placed for signature in the Exchange portico and aU the principal hotels, and people were pressed to affix their names. The attempt did not appear to be very successful, hut there is a general impression that the movement emanates from a quarter likely to have influence with the committee. FoEEs' N..TIjO1NA SPOITS.-This series lhas lately bean continued by a set of four colo-zed :plates fuiestrabive of racing. They are carefully copied from the original pictures by the elder Berring, and are entitled" Saudling," "' A False Start," "Tha Run In," and " Returning to Weigh." They corecspor' in number, size, and st3le with the set of fox-hunting plates wghici- were noticed in this journlal at the timne of thair publication, ar d are known to moet lovers of the nolUe sport. Althongh these racing plates contain the nisual f4ults of convention. ality en form anad atituide, and consequently can lay no claim to the rare merit of displayi:g the hree as an idlisidmual, yet they are valuable as a faitbtsl record of the general cihsanateiistics of the racer of the. present day, and aie Fpeoially to be noted as a vast improrement upon the general run of plates and picturaeof a similar class.

MAILITARY AND NA VAL INTJ'ZLIGENCE. It is understood to be tbe intention of the auth"ztiea at the WarofiieA to remove the 500 men now being raiscd in Mleffield to Cbathaen, as soon an the number is completed. It is not unlikely thatCthe whole of the men will be draughted into the same corr, and the Ofth is mentioned as the regiment to which they wil be attached. The number of reerwits daily arriving at Chatham is 0onsiderably on the increase, and since the recent order was issued from the Horse Guards upwards of 1,000 have joined the Indian hattalions at that garrison. Additional recruitIng patties have been sent out from the head-quarters of the Royal Engineers for the 4th, 10th, 11th, and 21st companies of Sappera and Miners in India. It is expected that the reduction of the standard will induce a large body of men to join the Royal Marine Light Infantry. The 76th Pegiment arrived in Dublin on Tuesday from Nova Scotia. The frigate Indefatigable, 50, Flag of Rear-Admiral WIlliam Dope Johnstone, was reported off Plymouth yesterday mornirg from the South American station. The screw steamship Austria, Captain }leydtmann, from Cork, for the EAst Indies, which put into Plymnouth Sound on Saturday, disembarked her troops, nearly S00 of the 94th Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Mills,. at the Royal WTlli am Victualling-yard, Stonebonse, on Tuesday afternoon. The head-quarters hnd the Grenadier company are at the Plymouth citadel, bnt the other portions of the regiment occupy the barracks at Millbay. At the monthly meeting of the Liverpool Town Council yesterday there was some discussion with reference to the proposed erection by the Ordnance authorities of a battery on the site of the old magazines, New Brighton. It was asserted that guns fred from that position would place the shipping in the Liverpool docks in continual danger, and the question was ultimately referred to the Dock and Fin ance Comrnmittees, with the understanding that tbey were to represent the opinions of the council to the Ordnance authorities. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty:- Commander T. Ef. Chads, to the Persian, commissioned; Commander W. H. Truscott, to the Heron, commissioned; Lieutenant R. H. Barton, to the Triton, commissioned; Lieutenant J. C. Campbell, to the Spitfire, commissioned; James B. Haines, second master, to the Hastings; Charles Ross, paymaster. to the Cornwallis; Andrew Edwards, paymaster, to the Wellington; Thomas J. Woodward, paymaster, to the Hawke; Adolphus D'Albertanson, clerk, to the Wellington; Peiring EUis, clerk, to the Melampus; G. W. Underhill, clerk, to the Conway; Arthur H. Gore, clerk, to the Hastings. THE MILITIA. By an order from the War-office, the Royal Berks Regiment of Militia (with the exception of a depot company left under the command of Captain Maitland) was removed to Aldershott Camp on Saturday last. Previous to their departure the men were addresed by Colonel Blagrave. The Northumberland Artillery Regiment of Militia was inspected on Tuesday by Colonel Douglas ;n Tynemouth garrison, previous to being disbanded, the term for drill expiring tc-day. The men were exercised in battalion drill, the use of field guns, and ball practice, and their appearance in the field was highly respectable. The Darham Artillery Regiment of Miitia is assembled atpresent in Sunderland barracks for the usual drill. The men are making creditable progress. The following regiments of militia will be immediately embodied for garrison duty:-Bedford, 2d Royal Cheshiret 2d (South) Devon, 2d Glecester, Leicester, Northampton, Shropshire, 1st West Norfolk, 1st Surrey, 1st Stafford. abire, Ist Tower Htamlets; Worcester, 2d West York, Sussex, Stirling, and Aberdeen. These regiments will form an addition of about 14,000 men to our home establishment. Abont 3,000 of the Irish militia will also be embodied forthwith.
ACCIDENT OY THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY. TO TE13 EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Two letters appear in The Times of tho 12th inst. describing the perilou s position of some passengers on the Great WFestern railroad from the absence of any means of communication bet ween the passengers and the enginedriver. The principal objec'ion urged against the establlshment of such a commuzication is the abuse that might occasionally result from the timorousness of over-nervoustravellers. Against this let me su ggest to the public, through the medium of your columns, the system adopted in many con tinental countries of awalk constructed for the guard along the outside of passenger trains. A wooden ledge on a level with the steps should be affixed to every passenger carriage. For the safety of the guard a light iron railmightbe added. A bell orsome other means of communication might easily be devised between the carriages ard the guard's van, and after answering the summons of a passenger the guard could by means of signals or his whistle convey the necessary orders to the engine-driver. I am aware that there is not much novelty in this saggestion; but, as the directors of railway companies persist in maintaining the impossibility of employing any expe. dient to avert the frequent dangers of the present system, I think that the public should learn how such matters are managed In other countries, and with how much case the safety of passengers can be sewnred if a little goodwill be employed, Yours trulv. MANGLED REMAINS. kborts, Oct. 13. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I take up the farst Den and per near at hand, agitated by having just read the frightfnl account of the carriages on fire on the Great Western Railway, where your correspondent says ' It vvas 20 minutes before they could make the engine-driver hear." Now, had my invention of a reflector been on the engine this would never have occurred without the wilful neglect of the erginedriver cr his companion. I did say I would send the idea to you many years ago; but, seeing so many clever and sclentific !Len at work upon the subjeet, I withdrew my smalL voice, thinling it would soon be drowned by the powerful cry of !ractical men. But seeing the frightful accidents and loss of life, I may really say almost daily recurring, pray let my invention be made known. I know reflectors have been txled; but bave they been placed In the manner and form in which I would propose? I have tried mine on a rallway engine, and I could see the whole train at one glance ; and in the case of the gentleman " with the handkerchief on the umnbrella," &c., it must be seen, providing, as I said l efore, the driver only gives an occasional glance. I send you a scratch of what I saw and leave you th judge. No wires, no tubes, no anythmig, with the exception of a looklrg glass of a peculiar form, and- I am afraid the most difficdlt thing to procure-vigilance. Should you deem this worthy of pubHdcity I would comune further; but let me entreat you, fwith your powerful n.eaus, to take some notice of my idea, T VfflAmfi S.n JOHIN PARRY. Soultbsea, Oct. 13.
A lA IL WAY CA RIAGE ON FIRE. TO TEtE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I noticed in a recent nurmber of your paper a thril- i description of a railway carriago on fire, and I am induced to call the public attention, with your permission, to ti e great importance of establishing some mode of prompt c. Onmunication between the guard and the enginedriver. Yesterday in coming south, from Carlisle to Lancaster, the passengers in one carriage were thrown into great aLarm by the burning of a large quaTntity of luggage whieh had beeu placed over their heads. My attention was first attracted by the flying of numerous cinders and large flakes o burning materials by the window of the carriage in v,bich I vas seated, followed soon by loud cries of alarm. I5n looking ourt I saw the Dassengers in the carriage in front of us in a state of great alarm, calling for belp at the top of their voices, while the flames were raging fiercely among the luggage over their heads. The traln in every otherpart wasin its usaal state, no symptoMs of alarm being visible anywhere, tbe guard being unawaro of the great danger in which the passengers were placed. One of our passengers, seeing that the safety of his fellovw, required that prompt measures of relief should be adcepted, opened the door and stepped out upon the side rail, mnaking his way as rapidly as poseible to the rear, to alarm tbe gnard. After passing several carrkxges he s3W tht this offlcisal was powerless, having no.comanuication wiih the driver. 'ihs gentleman then made his way back to the engine, to alarm the driver, and bad come mear the locomotive when two lend explosions announced, the fact that the signal of alarm had been made. Persons w,orking on the line, seeing this gentleman in this extraordinary position, al,d the heads of aU the passengers olut of the vindows, placf.d detonating signals upon the rail, and the train was thus b' ronght to a pause. I cannot tell how loeng a time was thus conmmed, but it seemed to the terifieei passengers to. be a very great delay vwhile it was in susp Jnse whether they were to he burnt to death or to hazard sfe by leaping from the train, as one lady vwas restraine d by force from doing. I am astonishe i that in England, where there is so much regard for life, It should be permitted to run railway trains without a sigis al line, by which their progress mnay be in- n tmey ca, where it is thought there prevails a great I(c ttlWeSsur^s of human life, all trains have a signal line running from the engise wvhistle entirely through theni, so tat Ir m any carriage notice oan be instantly conmmunicate@. to the eainor,iver. I have seen in England seom att'.npte to do°this, but the line was always arranged in a anner so awkward and inconvenient that it would not, I fear, be fe' very useful in an emergeney. The arrP.,ge. icent of *leeFG lines on American ratlwnys is very 'mnple, and tkeG line may ke sapaated between the carnia ges when aDfo them are de'ached, and may he leugthes'.d wvithout ir.qfiy when merze carriages are added.

THE INDIAN MUTINI.9g. The following ia from an officer at Alinora :- I" Alwora, July 21. "I put off writing beoause one is always in hope of having some better news to communicate, but each day only brings sadder accounts, and we eamn rno nearerto the takting of Delhi than we were a month ago )Ky last lkttor from home was dated the 2d of April I It is a grievous trial for us all, for of course no one here has had any either, or anybody in the wretched North-West Provinces. I am expecting IK-- every hour from Nynee Tal, where hs has been the last 1&days. He is thoroughly inter. ested in his work with the Ghoorkas under him. It was proposed to snake limbers or gun carria3es to transport the guns when required down to Bareilly; it is settled now they can only be transported en hackerocs, as the roads are too bad for any other kind of conveyaxnce. If you got my last letter you will knovw that ox the Artillery officers being ordered hence to Delhi M---was again put in charge of the guns here. Of course, if at anl able, be will be sent down with them in the cold weather. Tvhere is to be a snountain train formed for these hills. A, melancholy accident occurred at our camp at Delhi lately. A messenger came galloping towards it with despatches trom Sir Patrick Grant, and he had also a verbal message, which bh was to give the commanding officer alone; ho had escaped a band of mutL neers with difficulty, vwben actually our own pickets took him for an enemy, and, though he ehowed a white flag and his despatch, they centinued to fire upon him until the pooe fellow dropped mortally wounded, and he only lived 10 minutes after refusing to communicato his messsge to any but the Commander-in-Chief, who could not getthereintinre to receive it. . . The Nawab of Rampore continues t, send us supplies. . . . . I must send this and will begin another letter soon. God bless and watch over you all. Pray for poor India. Somothing glorious mnust come of all thisIt will be such a blow to heathenism. No one can think Christianity is to be overthTown in India, and, if not, what may we not expect ? The only comfort in it all is the belief that our blessed Lord's kingdom is to be greatly extended by these and such like events. "Aug. 2. "Quite accidentally I heard to-day that the davwk is going. I must not let it pass, though I had much rather have done so just nowv, having no cheerful news to communioate. .. . Please send us, vi,!

Next to your own letters (of which we have not received one) they will be beyond everything interesting and acceptable. Poor i- is in cruel suspense about his brother and uncle, and there are the most horrid reports afloat about Futtygbur, Cawnpore, &kc. Thisisnothingbuta religious panic purposely created and fostered by the OudO and Delhi-ites. The hlussulnians have fcoled the Hindoos into joining them by the chupatty business. Perhaps you do not understand that part of it. You inow the army was gained by making the mnost of our Government cartridges for the Enfield rifes, and all the soi-disant Emperor of Delhi had to do was to gain the llindoos, the land. holders, to his interests. Re got a cbupatty made, and sent it to the head of a village in the name of our Governrnaent. This man was ordered to mnake another chupatty, and send it to the next village, and so ou to all the villages in the North-West Provinces, if not throughout the presidency. When this had been done by our order, as it appeared, the Emperor caused a rumour to be circulated that the first chupatty had been filled with cow's bones, so that the man who touched it lost his caste, and, as be was to make the next chupatty, the man who touched what he made lost his also, and so on throughout the country, and that Government had Imagined this ingenious expedient for destroying caste, and compeUing the conversion to Christianity of all Hindoos at once. It suoceeded but too well, and it will be very difficult ever to divest the natives of th false impression thus given. " Jung Bahadoor, of Nepaul, has given us free and full permission to make our escape into his terrivories, if necessary, and Captain - has written to him for troops. It is reported that he is on his road with two regiments to help us to keep down these Bareilly and Ran,pore people till our European reinforcements arrive, whicb is hardly to be ex. pected till Christmas. We are in a sonmewhat criticalsitua tion. Mhan Bahadoor at Bareilly has sent 3,000 of his new levies to the foot of our hills to try to get up to Nyuee TalYesterday and to day Is the Buckra Ede of the Iussul mans, and they say he wants to sacrifice Christians instead of goats on the occasion. Captain - is prepared, and the colonel and several otber officers left this morning for N ynee Tal. Four guns were sent some time ago, and M- had to send 40 of his (hoorlsas yesterday, whom he has been training to work them. 'They will not let him go, because there must be one Artillery officer lhere in case of an out. break. The gaol is full of the disarmed Artillry, and wve must prevent their getting out. " All the ladles, about 78 or more, are being sent over here, and arrive by t7he dozen, with infirm old brigadierE, &C. It is so difficult to get enongh Coolies. Captain -- cannot send them off fast enough. You knowv you cannot hear from us if we have to go off to the fort at Pethora Gurh, or on into Nepaul, so do not give us uop in a hurry, and never mind if you miss one or two mails, for robbers will stop the dawl-s sometimes, and the rains too make them late for the mails. I do not write about the children,for reaUy one can hardly bear to look at them. May God preserve them i! I have told you of our friend the Nawab of Rampore, who has hitherto been sending us supplies and money; heis now almnost a prisoner, and if they klll him, which is daily expected, a relation of his, and our enemy, will do all he can against us. This is whab we have chiefly to dread, but it is said the Hindoos of Oude are comirg to revenge themseves for the ill-treattcent they have already experienced from their deluders the Mussulmans, and it is to be hoped that will keep them down below, and then we may be relieved. " It is something having a clergyman again in the station. Air. Poynder will be here this wcek, and he will give us a morning service. The churoh is stiU unfinished, and it ought to have been built tvice over by this time. We live in perpetual excitement, when calming, soothing influences are uspecially desirable. My best com,fort is that we are in the hands of God, whose never-failing providlence ordereth all things both in Heaven and earth. May we be His in lifeanddeath "Aug. 4. "I have just received your letter, dated Jana 1, so I have lost three mails. They say our letters were put into the fort at Agra, so ve may have them yet. The Bareilly levies do not advauce to N ynee Tal, and seem to be retiring from the foot of the hils, and curiously dwindling in numbers, findirg us so well ptepared, guns and all; so now we are only in dread of the Rampore people. A letter was received the other day from the vNawab, informing us that he had heard cof the actual arrival of 8,000 Euxropeans before Delbi ; but this needs confirmation. The reports of Cav,npore and Futtyghur massacres are very alarming to us and others he'e on account of friends and relatio7s there ; but it is impossible to know wbha to think or believe, they vary so from day to day. " Mrs. TheUusson and her children arrived here last night."

INDIA N XUTlNlB,8.-ZE SaLrCp U I M I B IzP FUND4, ST. PANORAR- I& pubbi meeting of the inhabitants of this p&MR was eli yesterday at the Schoolroowg, Sou6ampton.treet, hustonusquare, for the purpose of supporting the move. n ent now in progress for the relief of the sufferers by the tUdian mutiny. The Rev. Canon DALE, vicar of the parish, was caUed to the cbsir, and in his opening observations explained the rfasom why the mecting had not been oalled earlier to be tbe absftee from town of many of the wealthier inhabitants of the pariah. That reason still existed in a great measure but it had been felt more desirable to call upon the inbabitants of that great pariah to manifest their sjmpathy with our suffering countrymen in the East than to portpone it for any furthfr period of time. It was not the large contributions of wealthy persoas that wae alone to be songbt, but the camulatire oSeringa of thwe who had little togv, but who rneverthelers gave willigly in aid of a cs*ne w*ch' must have the umpatliy of every E:giishman. He calculated that at the perish ebnrob apon the: Day of HumiliAtitn uot les than 2.60& ptrsons had contributed te the collectieo tben made. T%eaggreg4te of those smrall contributions formed a tolerably larNe hum, and he held the moral value of such donationy to be thet aTmount of self-denial exOrcised b7 the contributors, and not the actual amount of money contributed by each. It was, rmost gratifying to find tInt the hearts of all had been stirred no in what was alike the :xuse of Englishmen and of Obris5ianity. Without entcring upon the sad events which rernderedthe present meetinX necessary ho would simply rt commend the establishment in that parish of a large cortmittee to aid in raising contributions-for the Muthay Fund. ie would farther purpose that there should be snubcomnnittees formed in each divisior, of the parish to-collect subcrilptioas from bouse to house, so that all clasesee- hould have an opp,ortunity of particpatirg in the worak of Ihumanity. He had received lettrs from several gentL-men, who were unable to be present, but v ho were desirous of cooperating in the objects of the meeting, and amongothersfrom Dr. Hamuilton' who directed the "iLst-day ooieotibn at Lh church, araounting to 321., to be added to the paroeblal fund, and from Professor Newvman, of University Obllege, in aid of a cause " in vwhich every burmane Englishman- nust painfully sympathize." Another gentleman, who was not a weplh y man, had remitted 11. 1O. as-a thank-offering fir tbe safety of his brother, whose company of Sey-Ys at Benares had remained faithful while the resct of the regimnent (the 37th NYative Infantry>~ bad revolted. Whatever differenee might exist as to thecauses which led to the mnutiny, or asto the steps which should be taken in future, there could be but one opinion lbteprpit and the necessity for she present movement, and he had ittle doubt that the parish of St. P'ancras wouldhe founnd ing and anxious to contribute its fair proporton to the fund now in progres. The Rev. D. LAIANG, incumbent of Trinity Church, in moving the first resolution, reminded the nmeeting that whatever errors bad led to the present outbreak the people in this country had an equal share in thpm, and therefbre were bound in common Justice to relieve those who alone suffered fron their consequences. One painful instance of the miserr caused by the mutiny in India had come to his- own knowledge. Thewidowof aclergyman-wbose husbandwas sot in his pulpit, and his whole con regation slaughtered with him, was unable to withdrawv froma the ba;nk sonue money which her husband bad deposited there, from in-bility io prove by white witnesses the fact of his death. He bad been enabled to procure admission to the St. Ana's School for two of that poor lady's children, but her case was cue of many similarsad histories. The rev. gentlernan concuded by moving,- Tbat this meetlng, de-ply sympatbizIng with our enfFering fellow. countrymen io India, audviewing With the urtmost a7sborreaes and con. uM tholtroyUes wmmltte abrhemutineerunnot ariy to nsdimarni6d men, but defenselm women and ebtdren, do herby reocgnie the commOn Cuty of alSlU Eahhmen to allevst e by aUl meat: in tbeir power the misery aud destitutioa whih thla ca,anAtous outneeak hen caused., The Rev. H. W. BURROUGHES, incurobent of ChiAtchurch, seconded the resolution, and hoptd that that great parish would not be found wanting upon the prezent occasion. He was glad to find that the Mansion-house cornmittee had sent 1 00'Z. to the Lawre.cre Asylum (bear, hear) to supply the loss of that s-am which wias annually contributed by its founder, Sir H. Lawrence. Mr. COLLE-1IT wished to move an alteration in the resolution, but the CHAiR.suie, supported by the meeting, declined to hear him, and the resolution was tlstn agreed to unanimously. The Rev. S. MiT.ToN moved the second resolution,- " That an immediate and ursent appeal be new mad, to resident, of aU clases in the parish or St. Pancras and that a comu.nth e be formed for ts purpmoe, without regard to dif,,ece coi Eos posit!on or ot religious creed.1 Had it not been for the dreadful calamities which had befallen so many of our country men and women in India he sbould have regarded the present mutiny almost as an advantage, for it would recall England to a sense of its duity in tCe East, where hitherto we had dishonoured our rebgion in order to insure the fidelity of the native arniv, an object in which it was now seen we had entirely failed. Afr. S. WTcG seconded the resolution; which was als carried unanimously. The Rev. C. PiniLLLES proposed the formation of a committee,ad After the adoption of tbe resolution, and passing the usual vote of thanks to the Chiiirman, the meeting separated, a collection being made at the doors. DURHAM. A public meeting was held in the: new Town-hall, Durham, on Saturday, for promoting a subscription for the suffe. ers by the muthines in India; the Mayor occupied the chair. The Bishop of DuRenAw moved the fir-t restlution:- "Thatthlsmeetieg, while Itrecogu)zea thebhand of God hi the pro. sent feasfulinaurrocttoa in India, desirer likewize to express Its deemes cympnthy with our fellow.ooiznutymec who have been it, Victims " He thought England, in all her dealings ith India, had not been true to the Chrfstian principles c,f faith she professed. Sno had given her full confidence and support.to the idolatrous religion of the corntry, but no encouragement to the propagation of the Gospel of ChristL He hoped that the war might lead to the adoption of a different policT by this country. After alluding to the sufferings of our fellorcountrymen and countrywomen in the East, his Lordship remarked that he could not believe that the outbreak had proceeded from any tyranny on the part of the British Government. It had proceeded, in his opinion, from over-indulgence, and so far from the people of India being in a worse condition than before they were infinitely improved. The resolution was seconded by Alderman BRtuiwrLt, and carried unanimously. Nearly 1501. was subscribed in the room. RYDE, ISLE OF WIGHT. A meeting of the inhabitants of Ryde and neighbourbood was held at the Town-haU on Monday, at uhich Mr. BD B_rrow, chairman of the Ryde Improvement Counirvisioners, presided. The meeting was attended by a large number of the nobility and gentry. The Right Hon. Lord Dow.aEs proposed and the Rev. Henry OLI\-IER seconded the first resolution. " That this tneetingdearle3 to exprs3s its eyrpathy with the crff.ers from the Indlaul mutteys. lt conlideLce in tbe coarage of the Brtti,h coldiers aud the rUhteouawea, of our came, ard Its trust in the God of battles to grat a 3uccssful tue to cur undFrtAlis."' The second resolution was proposed by General Sir JAII Es CALuwELL, G.C.B., and seconded by Rev. Dr. FEER(t7sos,:- "1 That ttl3 tmeettig dOesres to ovinc? nore nubtantijllY Its ssnpathy v ith those deprived of their hones, their property, and domestio com. torts by themselves itberally subscrlbing, and b; itducing the reidents of Rydea nd lt, neigbourho.d to do the sarse, twars the geceral fundbeing zried for there6lief of the siffattra uuder the vresidaunc of the Lord Mayor of London." On the motion of the Rev. A. J. WADg, seconded bv Mr. HENa-y STEPmErNs, a committee was appointed to carry into effect the foregoing resolutions. A subscription list was, after the meeting, opened in the Towvn-halL and 2401. was immediately seub-eribed. Th3at sum has since been considerably increased by collectionsmade from house to house by the committee. SHCi-TH MOLToiv.

FORBIGN INTBLLIGENCB. FRANCE. (FP-0X OUR OWN CORPXSPONDfl.) (A porion of the following appeaed in oux second edition Of vegterdAv --I PARIS, OCT. 13, 6 P.ML According to the most recent intelligence from Madrid no Ministry had yet been formed, but Admiral Armero was expected from Senve, and, it was thought, woould be charged with the construction of the new Cabinet. This would include, it was said, M. Mon, but this is difficult to understand, for it may be considered as quite certain that he would enter no Government except as its chief; and we have not yet heard of his having arrived in Spain. Mly belief is, that up to last night nothing was decided, and that affairs continued in the same dislocated state in which they have been since the commencement of the month. Arnlero is a man of no political note or reputed talent; he belongs to the Mon fraction of the Moderado party. Two days ago Queen Christina, who returned to Malmaison on the 8th from her journey to meet her daughter, the Duchess de Montpensier, received a telegraphic despatch from Queen Isabel, and since then she has had an audience of the Emperor. This gives rise to many conjectures, the most probable of which is that the despatch was to consult the old Queen about the formation of a Ministry, and that, in consequence of this, and either wvith or without her daughter's authorization, Christina went to take the Emperor's opinion. In that case, it is robable that O'Donnell would be recommended. gut O'Donnell, without a colp df (tat, would be impossible for any length of time. Under a constitutional regime he would soon be turned out by the Chambers. The coincidence of the telegraphic despatch and the audience, both of which are certain, is, to say the least, curious, and it is impossible not to believe that the two incidents are closely connected, and that they both have reference to the present crisis at Madrid. Further than that all is mere hypothesis, since nothinag has transpired of the contents of the despatch or of what passed at the interviewr. It has been thought by some that Queen Isabella would try to retain the Narvaez Alinistry until the opening of the Cortes, dragging on from day to day under pretext of the impossibility of replacing it; but Narvaez is not the man to be beguiled in that way, and if, as appears positive, he is resolved not to meet the Chambers, he is capable of taking some very decided steps to get rid of the office he no longer desires to hold. Meanwhile, any decrees that absolutely require his signature will be dated previously to the last and final resignation of his Cabinet. Letters of the 9th, from Madrid, confirm the statement that Bravo Murillo refused to form a Government, in consequence of exigencies to which he could not yield. One difficulty was, that the Queen wanted to have Manuel Concha in the Cabinet. We are told also of an extraordinary project of Her Majesty's, according to which there was to be no Prime Minister, but all were to be on an equality, and she herself would be President of the Council. Peop-e are puzzled to understand exaetly what she is aiming at, but it is feared that she is yielding to her old A bsolutist predilections, and some uneasiness is felt among Spaniards in Paris as to what may occur. If Bravo Murillo, whopossesses the confidence of a compact party, Conservative and Monarchical, has failed to obtain that of his Sovereign because he was found too constitutional, it would certainly seem as if what remains of the Constitution were in danger, and an Absolutist attempt not improbable. On the other hand, that Isabella should have consulted her mother must be considered a demonstration in a contrary sense, for, unless some exceedingly recent change has taken place in the sentiments of Christina, she wiU urge her daughter to uphold the Constitution, with which her crown is Identified. Such, at least, have been up to a very late date the tenour of her advice and the language of the Rianzares organ in the Madrid press. It is possible, and even probable, that the non-agreement between the Queen and Bravo Murillo arose from his insisting on the removal of certain persons from the Palace. Bravo Murillo is not desirous of power at any price, or he might have taken it last summer. Thanks to his celebrated "s settlement" of the Spanish debt, he is a wealthy man; and he is not generaUy considered to be so ambitious of the thankless task of a Spanish Prime Minister as to undertake it without seeing the ground clear before him, and his Government secured from the undermining practices of Camarillas ; so that he may very likely have imposed rather hard conditions. There has been some talk lately in the American journal! of a fresh expedition to Nicaragua. Walker, it has been said, although defeated, was not discouraged, and was disposed again to head an army of adventurous spirits, whom the sight of the maimed and tattered remnants of the last campaign had not dismayed. I understand that President Buchanan has addressed to ail American Ministers at foreigan Courts a confidential circular, in which he declares that the principles of international law as regards neutrals shaU be respected by his Government, and that any expeditions from the United States against countries with which they are at peace shall be prevented by all legal means. The session of the Wallachian Divan, and probably also of the Moldavian, is likely, according to information from Bucharest, to be very brief. The elections in Wallaohia, as you are doubtless aware, have resulted quite in favour of the extreme Liberal party, generaUy known as the patriots of 1848. The Boyards have been completely defeated. The intention of the majority is to vote the main points of their programme, which are the union of the provinces, their self-govermment, a foreign prince, and a constitutional government, and then to close their sittings. As regards the drawing up of the Constitution, internal organization, &o., those matters, they say, do not concern the Paris Congress, and can be settled here after by the Moldo-Wallachians themselves, siuce those provinces have always been de jutre in possession of self-government. If this be admitted, and the men of 1848 maintain the ascendancy which the late elections have given them, there can be little doubt that the future Constitution of MoldoWaUachia will be of a most democratic naturea single Chamber, vote by ballot, and so forth. We find among the Deputies of the Wallaehian Divan some few men who cherish the very wildest tenets of modern democracy, men in the same line as Mazzini and Ledru Rollin, and known in other countries than their own as members of republican clubs and implicated in dangerous conspiracies. The trial before the Colmar Tribunal of Count Jules Migeon on charges of corrupt electoral practices, &c., already mentioned, still continues to ex cite extraordinary interest in that part of France, where the Count is wel known. In the Legislative Assembly of 1849 he was noted as a Bonapartist, and sat next to Count de Persigny. After the coup d stat he was sent on a Government mission into Alsace, and in the electious that followed he was returned aa the Government candidate for Belfort. He then quarrolled with the Government, which opposed him in this year's election, but without success, since he obtained a majority of 7Z,000 votea. Nineteen persons were to have been prosecuted with him, but the charges against 18 of them were abandoned. The witnesses are extremely numerous, and among them are several public functionaries, some of whom appear but ill at ease imder the searching questions and sarcastic observations of Jules Favre. M. Migeon himself enters into animated discussion with some of the witnesses for the prosecution, who certainly display a very hostile animus. It has been elicited that a number of persons were arreated when distributing handbills in the interest of the Opposition candidate, on the ground that they could produce no passport or papers certifying whom they were. They were taken up as vagabonds by the Gendarmes, and placed at the disposition of the Procureur Imperial, although they were in the immediate vicinity of their habitual residence, and their identity might easily have been established. Their stock of handbills was taken from them, because, said the non-commissioned officer of Gendarmes, it is customary to seize everything that is found in the possession of a person who is arrested. M. Favre brought out all these circumstances by his cross-examination, and, struck by the system they disclosed, could not re- train one bold exclamation, which few of the papers have ventured to report. " This, then " he cried, " in the liberty we enjoy 1" It is well Lnown how much passion there freouently is in the proceed- ings of a French trial, and this one has not, as yet, been deficient in passages that produced great excitement in the court, which has been densely crowded, the audience including several members of the Legislative Body, Government function- aries, and clergymen. A lively sparring-initch occurred between M. Migeon and a M. iothea, a Justice cf the Peace, who declared that the Count had always persecuted him, and who certainly deposed like one glad of the opportunity of revenge. "I forgot to tell you," he exclaimed, vhen his examination was apparently at an end, "tbat at Cernay I was quite close to M. Migeon, and saw him wearing the riband of the Legion of Honour." One of the oharges is the illegal wearing of this riband. The witness was quite sure it was red, and exactly of the right tint; there was no stripe or edging that would have converted it into sorne other of the numerous orders that adorn the buttonholes of Europe, and,what was more, it was a rosette-officer's rank. " The witness says," said M. Migeon, is that I have always been hispersecutor, but I have numerous letters from him proving that he has more than once had recourse to my good offices. I have also reports from the lieutenant of Gendarmes concerning his morality." "My morality Is better than yours," retorted the Justice of the Peace, " and I prefer it." And so the skirmish continued the letters referred to being finally handed to k. Favre, to make use of In the defence. The proceedings of the trial, which have already reached a great length, contain some curious illustrations of French elections in 1857, and many persons think it rather unwise of the Government to give opportunity for, and indeed to provoke, such revelations and recriminations. The Duke de Grammont, the new French Ambassador to the Papal Court, had a private audience of the Emperor yesterday, and will leave for his post in a few days. The Debats has the following remarks on the accounts just received from India The general state of things remains doubtless the same, but it must not be overlooked that, in the reepective positions of the belligorents, the simple stats quo is an advantage for England, and that time also fights her battles. The date of the 17th of September gives the largest importance to the despatch, for It is essential to remember that the greater portion of the reinforcements from England are expected to arrive in India by the end of that month. On the arrival of the latter the straggle -wic to placed on an entirely fresh footing, and will, we have no doubt, result in the declsive success of England. This date, we repeat, gives to the news we have received a particular significance and a real importance." All the French diplomatic agents who are at present on leave of absence have been ordered to return to their posts by the end of the present month. A letter from Brest, of the 10th instant, announces the loss of the English brig Volant, of 212 tons, Captain Roberts, which had sailed from Brest a few days previously in ballast. This vessel was lost in the Bay of Berthaume, during a hurricane from the south-west, which caused great destruction on the coast of Brittany. The crew were saved, but the shiip is a complete wreck. It is generally supposed that one may travel in a stage coach i France without danger from highwaymen, but this appears to be not invariably the fact. A letter from Marseilles says that on Saturday morning last two highwaymen, armed with guns, stopped the diligence which runs between Brignolles and Aix. There were several ladies in the coach and two students, and on the box b3side the driver a postman was seated. The latter, terrified by the threats of the robbers, handed over 40f. which he had about him. During this operation the other robber kept his gun presented at the travellers inside of the coach, who delivered up their purses, containing in all a bout 400f.,with which the highwvaymen withdrew, threatenIng the passengers that if they made any noise they would return and shoot them. The Gendarmerie are in pursuit. Letters received from the departments of the Drome and Ardeche continue to give lamentable accounts of the devastation caused by the late heavy rains. On the 7th instant the waters in the Valley of Thueyts had risen two feet higher than their level on the 10th of September. A slk mill at Harnas has been completely swept away. The inhabitants of the village of Montpezat were detained prisoners fn their houses several hours by a rapid stream of water, which filled the streets with gravel and sand. The barracks of the Imperial Gendarmerie at Aubenas were considerably damaged. The Mayor of Colombieres was drowned, and his body had not been reeovered on the 7th. All the crop of chestnuts from Mayras to Montpezat (a distanee of four miles), which constitute the principal food of the inhabitants, is destroyed.

" The King had sleep at intervals during the day; the sieep was short, but tranquil. The attacks of congestion of the brain have not recurred this morning." AUSTRIA. (FRoM OUIa OWN COPR rSPONDNP.) VENNA, OCr. 11. There is a commercial as well as a monetary crisis here, and two first-rate mercantile houses have, within the last 24 hours, suspended payment. For some time past money has been so excessively scarce that respectable firns have not been able to get their bills discounted under 8, 10, or 12 per cent,, and the assurance has been given mt by persons who must be perfectaly well aware of whEat in passing in the commercial world that many firms, which two months ago obtained money at 6 per cent., are now paying 15 per cent. and even 18 per cent. for accommodatior. During the first three or four days in the last week several firms of minor importance were unable to meet their obligations, and yesterday telegraphic news was received from Peath that the great house of Boskowitz had declared Itself insolvent. The sum for which M. Boskowitz has failed exceeds 250,0001.; and his faU must necessarily lead to that of a great number of manufacturers of silk, cotton, and woollen goods. Although the insolvent has enormous mapazines in Vienna, Pesth, and Debreezin, filled with the choicest produce of the foreign and home mrkets, and real property of the value of 70,0001., it is not expected that he will be able to pay a larger dividend than 60 or 70 per cent. M. Boskowitz was the " middleman " between the Vienna and foreign manufacturers, and the tradesmen in Hungary and in the countries lying on the Lower Danube. The manufacturers gave an almost unlimited credit to the wealthy wholesale dealer In Pesth, who supplied with goods those traders who frequented the fairs which are held once or twice a year in the larger Hungarian towns. The last harvest was so good in Hungary that the peasants get unusually low prices for their corn, and cannot pay for the goods bought on credit of the retail dealers, and they in their turn are unable to honour the bills which they gave to the wholesale Peeth firm. The Bank is in posseesion of bills on Boskowitz to a very considerable amount, but it has wisely resolved not to demand the immediate payment of them by the endorsers, as it has a right to do, but to wait until they are due. Information has just been given me that the insolvency of Boskowitz has already led to the failure of one or two other firms of some importance. Recently reveral matters of importance have transpired which ought to have been kept from the knowledge of the public, and the Emperor was so incensed that on the 28th of September he issuedstrict orders that any employ' wlho should betray secrets intrusted to him in his official capacity ahould be punished wvith the greatest possible severity. One of your morning contemporaries about a week ago received telegraphic news from Berlin that the Austrian Army was already undergoing a considerable reduction, but the intelligence was premature. There will doubtless be a great reduction, but hardly before the question of the reorganization of the Danubian Principalities is satisfactorily settled. The Porte is resolved not to consent to the union, and it is my belief that the Emperor is determined to let the Sultan have his full support. There are many reasons why Austria should wish to avoid a war, but nothing short of force of arms would induce her to agree to the establishment of a Rouman State on the banks of the Danube, which in a few years would be neither morcn nor less than a Russian advanced post. Some positive information has reached me relative to the state of things in Milan. There is no longer so much open hostility displayed by the Milanese towards their rulers, but there is little goodwill felt towards the kind-hearted Governor-General, who is accused by the Italians of "reckless extravagance." It is a delicate subject to touch on, but it is my duty to state, that many people here are of opinion that his Imperial Highness is far too lavish of the public money. " His establishment," says an eyewitness, " is so magnificent, that the Imperial Oourt I appears mean in comparison." Marshal Radetaky is still alive, but very feeble both in body aud mind. He Is wheeled into his garden every day, and remains there for some hours. The veteran's memory has failed him, and he makes a sad confusion in names and events. RUSSIA. (FROM OU1 R BXRI.I OONREONDENT.) BERLIN, Ocr. 12. The intensity of the interest with which we are naturally enough watching the events in Tndia ought not to lead us to overlook what Russia is doing, particularly in eonnexion with our own Oriental complications. A recent article of the Northern Bee gives one an insight into the intentions of the Russian empire wFith reference to its Celestial neighbour. The N~orthera Bee says:- 01 The suspension of offendve operations on the part o the English against China aud the concentration of al their efforts on the pacific settlement of the conflict tha has broken out have very materially increaed the arro gance of the Chinese. To judge by appearances the latter are quite ready just now to declare war against all Europ) without maldng any distinction between old friends and new enemies. The procrastnating course of the English has imparted quite a new turn to the line of thought of the Pekin Government, which even before this entertained an extraordinarily high opinion of the strength of the Chinese State and of its importance to the rest of the world. Tae Governor of Canton has hitherto found it very easy to convince his Government of the efficiency of his measures against the English, the more so asthe latter have for want of means, not had it in their power to inflic a decisive blow on China. The bombardment of Canton w .s more injurious to the Europeans trading there than It was to the prestige of the Pekin Government in the eyes of the majorl.y of its subjects; the trade that Is still being carried on uninterruptedly at Shanghai, Whampoa, and othe places on the coast convinces them of this. ' It shows how indispensable we are to the Europeans,' say the Chinese, ' when they leave no stone unturned to muaintai their trade and their relations with us.' In the interest of all Europe, for the vindication of the auperiority of our civilization as compared with the Chinese, it is indispensably necessary to make good this faUure of the English to the best of our power, and b7 energetic measures convinoe the Chinese, once for all, of the superiority of Europe over their oountry. To this end the opening of direct negotiations with the Pekin Government, as well as of a oourse of action to be observed towards It without the intermediation of the provincial governor, is urgently necesary." The practical corollary to thbi reasoning is to be found in the announcement of the Nord, that Admiral Putiatin has received orders to repair to Shanghai with the Amoor fleet, which after its arrival there is to be reinforced by five light vessels of war. The Admiral had at an earlier period been Intrusted with an extraordinary mission to Pekin, but the Chinese Government had refused to receive him. The road thither is therefore now to be opened up by other means. The loss of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea is being rapidly made up to Russia by the creation of a fleet in the Pacific Ocean; Sebastopol is being compensated for by Okhotsk, Nicolaieff is finding a parallel in the arsenals erecting up the mouth of the Amoor, and very probably we shall soon hear of a new harbour being constructed on the island of Saghalien, if we may judge from the reports that are being sent in from time to time to the Petersburg Academy by Leopold Schrenk, who is no w examining into the resources of that island by command of the Russian Government. Instead of the one " sick man"-Turkey, Russia has now got two patients to look after-China and Japan. The tendency and colouring of the news which the French journals also publish in connexlon with China indicate an inclination on the part of France to join with Russia and England in common measures against the Government of the Celestial Empire, which seems to be indulging just now in most overweening arrogance towards we terrestri Lls in the West. The Portuguese lorcha Amazona, as we learn from the Pays, has lately brought over a copy of the last proclamation of the Viceroy of Canton. In full knowledge of what has drawn off our attention from him towards India, our old friend Yeh informs the population far and near that the "barbarians," terrifiedathismilitarypreparations and at the mere sight of his army, as numerous as the leaves of the trees that flourish in the forests of the Empire, have been compelled to embark, and return to the place whence they came. He adds that a new Chinese fleet wil soon put out to sea and sweep it of the hostile barks. The proclamation closes with very coarse invectives against all foreigners without distinction, and with the notification of a fresh extraordinary tax, which must be paid up within ten days of the publication of that proclamation, for the support of the Imperial troops. The Russian journals are perfectly dumb on the subject of the Imperial meeting at Stuttgart. In a recent number, the Yorthem Bee showed that even during the late war the commercial relations of the two Empires of Great Britain and Russia had not ceased to exist, and came to the conclusion that the two nations are so connected by their material interests that it only waits for a little mutual confidence for them to re-enter on the full enjoyment of the blessings of peace. The Imperial library has been much enriched during the last year, and among the more considerable additions made to lt is a complete collection of alU the inventions patented in England since 1617, ccnsisting of 25,000 pamph. lets, to which the Emperor ordered that aMentire and separate room should ba devoted. A letter from St. Petergburg, quoted by the Preussische Correspond enz, givesthe followingparticulars connected with the RuPsian man-of-war Lefort, I the loss of which in a late storm in the Baltic has been already described in your columns; tbe3 particulars will remind your readers of the fate of the Royal George at Spithead:- "E Everything that can be put forward with reference to the proxlmate cause of this catastrophe must of course be the produe of mere supposition (slnce all on board were lost), but this at least is a fact, that when thevessel put to sea the 'tweendecks was filled with domestio furniture and luggage of all sorts. It is most probable that from this cause the portholes,'some of which certdinly were left open on aso. | count of the women and children there, had become inaccessible, so that it was impossible to cose themrapldly enough' !Whether there was not ballast enough on board, whether the guns were not properly lashed, and so rolled over to leeward, must remain undedded, for of all the 828 persons on board not a single one bas been saved. On the other haud, the report that the vessel was go' ready for sea by speoial command in less h three days, that is to say with unjustifiable hurry, is devoid of all ground. The vessel was fully armed and provided with provisions and water for a month. Her ballast and provisions were in the same state of completeness as at the end of the campign of 1866. What makes the fate of the Lefort doubly lmentable Is that almost all her offioers were married men." A transport vessel that was built in Archangel for war purposes, and launched there this summer, with a view to its starting for Cronstadt, was found to make so much water on reaching that element that it was of necessity brought into the harbour again to be thoroughly repaired. THE KI,GDOM OF THE TWO SICILIES. (FROM OUR OWN CORlRESPONDENT.) NAPLES, OCr. 3. Since I last wrote I have been informed that the Criminal Court of Salerno has met and made preliminary arrangements for the approaching trial of tbose who were compromised by the events which took place in the beginning of July at Sapri. Of these persons there are 150, some of whom have been already sent down to Salerno. On this occasion it has been ascertained that those confined in the "'Criminali" have not been permitted to change their clothes or linen, or see their friends, since the day of their arrest. On their arrival in Salerno, therefore, dirty, and almost shoeless, they were assisted by the prisoners in that city. It is well known, too, that in some cases the charges have not been confined to the events of Sapri, but have been made to embrace other facts. As much was said some months ago of the appointmentof commissioners to visit the provinces and report on their state, it will be well to mention the following incident, which illustrates the spirit and character of these commissions. Signor Jocca one of those invested with the Royal authority, on his arrival in the Commune of Galiagni, in the province of Lecce, among others proceeded to Inquire of the judge, Signor Gianni, the state of the district. Gianni replied that all was perfectly quietthat the population was liberal, though well disposed, that many however had been placed under the surveillance of the police, as he thought, on malicious or insufficient grounds. The administration he pronounced to be infamous. On being requested to write his report he consented, asserting that it vas perfectly true. It now turns out that the judge has been dismissed from his office, and a few days since I am told was in Naples. Assuming that there is any connexion between the report and the dismissal of the judgewhich in Naples is not unreasonable-it shows how dependent the j udicial power is upon the political bias of the Government, and how far from sincere was the desire to investigate and ameliorate the condition of the country. There is the usual talk and the usual inaction in regard to railway and engineering matters. To consider such projects only as the Government has taken into its own hands, certain preposterous conditions offered by it to those competing for the contract have been lately shown to me, which display either itb folly or insincerity. One condition requires that those who compete for the construction of a bridge over the Volturno on the Roman railway line near Capua must send in an elaborate project and drawings-an estimate of the power of resistance offered by the iron works, and must pay down a tenth part of the estimated value of the contract. On getting the contract they must give caution for the entire amount. Similar conditions are required in respect of a bridge over the Calore, in the course of a military road near Benevento. I mention these facts to show you how foolish, or unpractical, or nsincere is the Government in all matteris benring on the material progress of the country. Of course the best engineers will have nothing to do with the conditions. The Brazilian Minister, Senor Ribsra da Silva, recently appointed to this Court, and formerly representative of his Court in Russia, has left for St. Petersburg to make arrangements for leaving finally for Naples A letter from Rome, in the Independente of Tarin, states that the Pope was to leave on the 12th for Civita Vecchia, where he would stay at least five days. Ac-counts from Naples of the 8th state that the Prince of Orange had arrived in that capital from Palermo, and been received by the King at Gaeta. SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 9th have arrived. The Minlsterial crisis continued. The lberia, the Clamor Publico, and some other papers say that it was believed that M. Bravo Murillo had declined to undertake the formation of such a Ministry as the Queen wished-that is, in which members of different political parties should enter; he, they say, represented to Her Majesty that a Cabinet could not hope to carry out useful measures and to follow a delinite line of policy unless it were under the complete direction of one chief. In consequence of M. Bravo Murillo's resolution, the formation of a Cabinet by Admiral Armero was spoken of, but some reports were current that the crisis would, after all, end in the reconstitution of a Cabinet under General Narvaez, while others represented that the Marquis de Pezuela was likely to be intruisted with the task of forming an Administration. Meetings of deputies had begun to be held to deliberate on the crisis. It is again positively stated that M. Bravo M-urillo was not summoned from Paris by the Queen; he nevertheless, it appears, travelled with such rapidity that he performed the journey between thetwocapitals in70 hours. AtCenia deRosell,ia the Maestrazgo, a number of workmen, some of them armed with guns, had paraded the streets, uttering cries against the Liberals; the Alcalde, accompanied by a number of the respectable inhabitants carrying muskets, turned out to disperse them. After an exchange of shots the mob fled. One of the rioters vas wounded, and five were arrested. The cause of the movement is not stated. A school for the staff of the navy had been established. A new lighthouse had been constructed at Cape Palafruguell, in the province of Girona.
THiE LATE 1dArOR Rsyxs.-John Sherbrooke Banks was born in September, 1811, and gave early indications of that courage and talent which shone forth so brightly In after years. He passed through his school career 'with great credit, and had the character of being a "superior classical scholar." He was appointed to a cadetship in 1828, and in 1829 arrived in India and was posted to the 33d B. N. I. About the year 1833 he was appointed to the interpretership of his regiment, and shortly after was for some time on detaohed duty for the suppression of Thuggee, in whioh he was very successfuL He was afterwards appointed to a civil magistracy in the Saugor and Nerbuddha Province, and was stationed at Jubbulpore. While diligent in the duties of his office he undertook the survey of his district for the formation of public roads and bridges, and sought in everyway to develop the resources of the country. It was to this district that Sir C. Napier referred in terms of unsur. passed praise. " There are some glorious magistrates who realy do exalt the honour and power of England in the East. I came through a district governed by a Mr. Banks; I do not know him, I never saw him, but I really felt proud of my countryman. Yet even there I found tyranny by the ' board ' wbich rules the Punjab ; he cannot help that ; aU he does himself is superb." When he retired from Jubbulpore on the breaking up of the establishment, he received a complimentary address from the natives. He was soon ap. pointed as assistant in the Auditor-General's Department at Calcutta, whence he volunteered and served with his regiment in the Affghan campaign of 1842, and was prerent at Mazeena and the subsequent actions during the advance on Cabul, and received a medal ( tbe return of the army; being on rearguard, a Sepoy of his company weas woundod and left behind; Lieutenant Banks returned for him, snd brought him in on his backot two men that accompanied him one was kiUled and tho other wounded. Captain Banks was soon after appointod Deputy Assistant-Secretary to the Government ot Indi Mltary Department, whence he volunteered for active service in the campaign on the Snxtlej. He joined his regiment immedittely after the battle of Sobraon, and was at once gazetted as Qaartermaster to General M'Gasddll's division and in the same Gazette was appointed Asistant-Sereta to the Govermnment of India Military Department, in the latter capacity he went through Scinde with the GovernorGeneral, Lord Hardinge. The head of his office being oa sick leave, Major Banks had the 'whole arzangements for the army for the Burmese war, and a eompetent authority stated that "no troope were ever sent out more efficiently prepared for ative aervioe. When Lord Dalhousie went to Pegu to arrange for the settlement and government of the newly-acquired province Major Banks accompanied him as4Secretary for the Government of India. In 1854 he was appointed by the Governor-General as his Private Military secretary, and accompanied his Lordship to the Neilgherrie Hills. In July, 1855, Major Banks was despatched from ootacumund to Lucknow on business connecttd with the annexation, and was appointed one of the Commissioners in Oade. He was in charge at Lucknow, where he resided from the commencement of 1f56. On the death of Sir H. Lawrence Major Banks succeeded him as Acting Chief Commiesioner in Onde and in the command of the garrison at Lucknow, and has speedily ftllowed his distinguished and gallant predecessor to a soudier's grave. While aotively employed in the duties of has profession he found time for diidgent and varied study. " He received degrees of honour in the Persian, Oordoo, ard Bengali languages frori the college at Fort William." Re had also studied Sansiit, Arabic, Hindostani, and Hindee, and was prepared to go up for degrees in two of those languages had not the duties of his office and consequent want of opportunity prevented him. To the above he added Hebrew and a superior knowledge of French, German, and Italian. Onetwhoknoewhim well personally and officially writes, " His loss will be most severely felt by the Government, for they had not a more able, consdentious and a more efficient officer." This is high prase ; but it s also a noble testimony to the East India Company that talent and character, without private patronage, which Major Banks had not, can win their way to some of the highest offioes which the Indian Government has to bestow. 'iorB%aks was kiUed at Luecknow about the end of July or beginning of August, after 28 years of uninterrupted servioe,
THE INDIAN MUTINIES. (From the Supplement of the London GcUe of Friday, INDIA BOARD. OCTOBER. 1.857. The following despatches have been at various times received at the East India House, and are now Inserted in the London Gazette, although previous publication hab not taken place in Iudia No. 8. Tnx DEPUTY ADJUTANT-GFzNZRAL O THE ARMY TO THE SxCRLZTARY TO TuO GOVER-NMENT OF INDIA. Calcutta, June 26. Sir,-I have the honour, by desire of the Commander-in.

Allahabad, Jane 17. SIr,-I have the honour to report my arrival here on the afternoon of the 11th inst., wlth a party of 40- men, the Fusileers having had more difficulty in getting on from Benares consequent on the disturbed state of the country, the road being partly deserted and all the dawk horses taken away by the insurgents. I found Alishabad closely invested, except on the river side, it being only approachable from the nvers; the bridge of boats on the Ganges partly destroyed; it and the village of Deeragunge in possession of the insurgents. On arriving atthe end of the Benaree road, at the village of Jansee, I was obliged to move down to my left; was fortunate to bribe some natives to bring a boat over th the left bank of the Ganges, in which I embarked part of my men. The people in the fort having by this time seen us sent over boats some way down; by these means we aU got into the fort, almost completely exhausted from our long night's march and the intense heat. On assuming command I at once determined to drive the enemy away and open up some communication with the country ; on the folowing morning I opened fire with several round shots on those parts of 1eeragunge occupied by the worst descrip-. tion of natives, attacked the place with detachments of Fosileers and Sikhs, drove the enemy out with considerable loss, burnt part of the village, and took possession of a repaired bridge, placing a company of Sikhs at its head for Its protecton. The next dy ajor Stephenson's detachment of 100 men, which had left Benares by bulock train the same evening I had, crossed the bridge into the front. On the morning of the 13th I attacked the insurgents in the village of Kydgange, on the left bank of the Jumna, and drove them out with loss. On the 14th I coald do little or nothing. Ever since I ardved here I have observed great drinking among the Sikhs and the Euro. peans of all classes, and it was not long before I learnt that large godowns belonging to merchants and river steam companies hsd been broken into and plandered, and the contents were distributed all over the place. Quantities of all kinds of cpirits and wine were brought into the fort by the Sikhs, sold to our soldiers at the lowest prices,* and the consequence was drunkenness to a disgraceful extent in the garrison. The Sikhs showed anything but a subordinate spilrit, and, being in tho same range of barracks with our men, caused me no small anxiety. I endeavoured to get hold of or destro all the liquor and ram, and succeeded in both by directing the Commisariat to purchase aU the liquor the Sikhs had to selL I sent out the only two carts I had to empty what remained in the godowns into the Commissarlat stores, and destroyed all that I could otherwise lay hold of. It appeared to me most desirable to get the Sikhs out of the fort; they were very loth to go, and their officers did not appear to me to have that authority over them to oblige them; it required some tact and management, and was happily effected by Castain Brasyer, who deserves the greatest credit, They are now outside in some houses, the old native hospital and others on the bank of the Jumna, under the guns of the fort, and, although attacked and obliged to retire on the night of the 14th tnst., some, including the adjutant, wounded, yet they soon regained their position. I felt that AiAhabad was really safe when erery native soldier and sentry was out of it, and as long as I command I shaU not allow one to be on duty in It. On the evening of the 14th I threw a shell from a howitzer on the brmtes into Kydgange, and the morning of the 15th early opened the same fire with round shot also upon It at daylight. I sent a steamer up the Jnmna -with a howitzer, under command of Captain Harwood, of the Artillery,and a party of 20 picked shots of the FnsUleers, under Lieutenant Arnold of that corps, who went up the river, eome distance above the city, and did much execation. The Sikhs were directed to attack and clear Kydgunge and Mootingunge on the Julmna, and were supported on the right by 50 of the Fusileers, under Lieutenant Bailey, aud the smaU party of Irregular Cavalrv. The troops behaved with great gallantry and spirit n the heat of the sun ; the Sikhs had the legs of the European, and the country they had to go over was less diffncult; the opposition they met with was not so great- they, however, punished the enemy severely, although tney hre badly, and are very wild. The FusUeers met with some resistance, did good execation among the enemy, but had two men kiled and six wounded, all severely, one dangerously, including Lieutenant Bailey, shot through the thigh. The insurgents were sO thoroughly beaten at all points, and our men had folowed them up so close to the city, that we have since been Informed the greatest terror seized them all, and they aU fled from the ctty during the night. They had also lost several of their chiefs, and the Moulavie, the chief of the insarrection, Id now, I understand, with a few followers, about 14 miles off. There are stil some villages inhabited by Mahomedan tawnties, who took a prominent and active part in the night of the mutlny, I will make an example of; but I cannot march out until I get sufficient cattle for my artilery, and also to draw carriages to convey wounded or men knocked over by the sun. Many Sepoys, supposed to be from Delhi, fought against us. We have had inteligence from the city of the dispersion and fight of most of the ringleaders. The Moulavie has fled, and two of his men of rank were slain on the 15th. Onr two guns, taken away from the bridge of boats by the 6th, were sent in to our outposts yesterday morning; also Mr. Cheek, of the 6th, since dead, and Mr. Conductor Coleman and his family, who escaped the night of the mutiny, although severely wounded and badly treated. The troops are in high spirits and as good health as can be expected this fearful weather, The Fastleers have endured more exposure and fatigue than most soldiers - their conduct has been admirable. r cannot speak too highly of Captaia Brasyer,of the Sikhs; he alone has kept that regiment togetber, and all right here. He deserves the greatest credit. He assisted me very greatly indeed in getting the Sikhs ont of the fort. I almost feared at one time that force wouald have to be employed. It was a very near thlng indeed. Fortunately, I was-able to employ the Sikhs in the constant attacks, which assisted. The Fusileers now here consist of 11 officers and 360 men. I have, &e., J. G.

I last did myself the honour of addressing you on the 17th iost. On the following morning I moved out with all my foroe, having the previous day obtained bullocks for my two guns. I sent one party of 80 Fuslleers and 100 Sikhs in the steamer, with a howitzer, up the river, to attack and destroy the Pathan village of Derryabad and the Mewattie villages of Sydabad and Ru2selpore, and to cooperate with me. I marched from cantorments, with 2Gi Fusileers, two gans, all the Sikhs and Irregular Cavalry, and proceeded as far as the gaol, thus getting between the city and the villages belonging to and said to be occupied by the insurgents. I met with no opposition, the enemy, I regret to say, having disappeared during the night; e swept and destroyed these viUages and collected all my force on the p:rade-grouand of the 6th Bengal Native Infantry. It was my Intention to have ocoupled the church and other baudings during the heat of the day, but as symptoms of cholera anmong the Fusileers had ocurred during the night, one man having been taken ll c -n rouc, I determined toreturn to the fort with all the Enropeans and leave Captain Brsyer and his Sikhg, with the Irregular Cvalry, accompanied by Mr. Court, collector and magistrate, to deshroyseveral vil=ages beyond the church, which work was properly done. I got back to the fort about 7 am., and regret to say that several of the men came into hospital with cholera in Its worst form. Eight men were barled last evening and 20 this evening; there are still manyrcass in hospital, but of a milder nature, and I hope, with God's bleldng, for the best. I had before this, fearing disease from the crowded state in which I found the fort, sent off two steamer loads of women and children, and, as the cantonment is now safe, I directed all the non-combatants out o the tor; this order has been attended to, I have also stablished a European hospital in a Masonic building a short distance from the fort, to which I have removod all cholera patlents. I have also occupled the dawk bungalow near it with a subaltern's party for Its protection; 100 Europeans are in tents on the glacis, and I movo out 200 to-morrow to a tope of tree near the dawk bungalow. No rain has yet fallen, the heat is intense, and the soldiers, after their hard work and exposUre, are much prostrated. The barracks here are in bad order, folowers of any description being also unprocurable. There are bat few punkahs and no tatties, the men have therefore not the proper advantages of barrack accommodation for this hot season. I regret to add that the supply of medicines here has failed there appears to have been little or none kept in Allaha.bad and our detachments only brought up sufficient £or the march, I am now in expectation of the arrival of the Mirzapore, which was also detained by the same authorities, which I hope has some little medicine on board. At the same time, I have also to complain of the civil authorities at Ghazeepore presuming to keep baok and not delivering to the officer commanding troops on board the Mirzapree, in Calcutta, written orders I sent through them for the re moval of the treasure at that station on board the steamer, to be brought by the Europeans to Benares. Two hundred bullocks with drivers were brought in here yekterday ; this is all our public carriage at present; our Commissariat officer is away, and that department is in eonsequence inefficient. I am prevented, therefore, from pushing on, as 1 wish, troope to Cawnpore; his Excelency may feel assured that I will do so as soon as I possibly can. I, however, apprehend that nothing can be done until we * Four siunas thebottle. all -w br, brudy, and wlnw of Q Ik1ni Ino1udlng chpmPagne. bay. had a shower of rain. A detcbment of the 84th Queen'e may be in to-morrow; I shall plboe them in the church, and the other Europe troops as they arrive, in other buildiDga in the cantonmeat. I beg to enclose Captain Fraser's report of hi march from Benares to this place Much good service haa been done by so thoroughly opening the road. The men of the detaohment acquittod themselves in their usual soldierlike and enduring manner; and I beg to bring to the notioe of his ExeUllency Captain Fraser, au Intelligent Aud energetic offioer, i whom I have the utmost confidence in any emergency. I am organizing a body of irregular cavalry, by joining Captsia Palliser's detAchment of the 13th Irregular Cavalry, with the few men of Captain Alexander's corps still remaining faithful to us, and expect to entertain some Sowars. I have established a system of patrolling in the neighbourhood with the troopers, to encourage the people to bring in supplies. The Moulavie haE left this th about 3,000 followers; his destinationis unknown, but suppoeDd ko be Lucknow or in this neighbourhood, I have arranged to beat up his camp if It is No.IL CAI'TAIN FRASER TO TIo O. C1R C0 N'DnSG AT ALLAiA AD. Allababad, Jaune 19. Sir,-I have the honour to inform yot that agreeably to instructions received from the officer commanding at Benares a detachment of Madras Fsileers, strength as per margin,' under my commnd, m hed on June 13, 1857 from Benares,for the purpose of acting against the maruder. and distarbers of the peae, and ith the view of openin the communication along tbe road to AUlahabad, which for some time had been interrupted. 2. Mr. Chapman, a gentleman well acquainted with the country, accompanied the party. 3. At Gopsaegunj, a deta2hneat of the 13th Iregular Cavalry, of 80 men, under the command of LAeutenAut Palliser, joined the expedition. 4. On the 14th inst., information having been received on oath that the inhabitants of two vilhges within a mile of the Grand Trunk Road, near Gopaegu:j, had been plundering the grain and stopping the communication, Ipro ceeded with part of the Fusleers to the aid villages, and called upon the prindpals to appear, but they had made their escape, an I ordered their housem to be burnt. 5. On the 15th inst., intelligence having been received that three Zemindars ho had proclaimed themselves Rajaha, and had been plundering, were then in a village about three miles from Gopegonj 50 men of the 13th Irregular Cavalry, under Lieutenant Patliser, proceeded to the village, accompanied by Mr. Chapman and Mr. Mloore, of the civil service, who joined our prfrom lairzapore. They succeeded in capturing the Zerda and bringing them int m p *rhere they re trid ine distely by court-martial, and hanged by 8 o'clock the me evening. 6. At midnight the detachment marched for Baroad, where we arrived at daybreak on the 16th, when I imme. diately proceeded with a party of 100 men of the MAdras FusUleers, and the whole of the Irregular Cavalry, to apprehend, if possible, a man named Belour Sing, who, with 1,200 followers, was reported to be in a village about five miles from the Grand Trunk Road, and had been plunderin the neighbouring vllages. On arriving at th village named Dobaar I found it deserted, and everything carried off, with the exception of some grain and a small quantity of gun. powder. T ordered Belour SWs house and village to be burned, and a rewari of 200 rupees was offered by Mr. Cbapman for his capture. 7. On the evening of the 16th inst., a Zemindar came to the camp, accompanied by a Dn_fadar, who was in commsnd of 12 Sepoys,w ho formed a gard over some Goverament treasure i a village about a mile off the road half way between Baroad and Sydabad. Mr. Chapman and myself arranged that the detachment should be halted at the nearest point on the road on our march to Sydabad, and a party pioceeded to the Tillage to recover tho treasure. About 1 am. on the 17th Mr. Chapman and myself with 25 men of the Fusileers, went to thi village and ared off the treasure, which was said to amount to 12,000 rupees and had been defended by the Sepoy guard in e of it although the village had been attacked by dacoits and burnt. The treasure was brought into Ausnabad, escorte by half the Sepoy guard, the remainder of the guard hvin been left to protect the villae The treasure was handed over on arrival here to Mr. Court, and I think that the Sepoys are fairly entitled to some remuneration from Government for having protected the treasure. 8. The punishment inflicted on the three Zomindars at Gopaegunj, and the fact of its being known that the detach. ment was able to march against and punish marauders at considerable distences from the high road, had the effect of intbmidating those who had been plundering; and when the detachment was at Baroad 23 Govermuent bullocks made their appearance, evidently brought to the neigh. bourhood of the camp by the people who had carried them off, but had become afraid to retain them. When the detachment was at Sydabad some more bnuocks and horses were brought back in the same way. 9 On arriving at Sydabad on the morning of the 17th inst a party of the Irregular Cavalry, under Lieutenant Palliser, proceeded to avillage about three milesoff, in which it was reported cerain people resided who had plundered the dawk bungalow and carried off the Government bullocks from Sydabad. Lieutenant Pallises party secured several prisoners, who were brought into camp aud tried by court. mautial. A party of the Fnsileers proceeded to another village longig to the aame people, but it was found deserted, and I ordered It to be burnt. A few Government bullockswererecovered. Twovillages were burnt by the Irregular Cavalry. 10. On the morning of the 18th of June the detachment arrived at Allahabad. I found the road clear the whole way, and am of opinion that any party of European troops, however small, may now travel the road with safety; but topteep the dawk open Ibelleve it is neoessary in the mean. time te establish a post of Europeans at Gop egunj, and another half way between that pace and lhabad, nd Colonel Gordon, commanding Benares, has, I understnd, ordered this to be done. IL It is impossible to speak too highly of Mr. Chapman's services, and am convinced that the measures adopted by him a magistrate at the different places epassed trough, if carried out by the police authonties, wilihave the effect of kee ng the road perfectly quiet in future 12o ro conduct of the Fnsileers on the march was most praiseworthy in every respect. 13. The Irregulbr Cavalry gave me evey satisfaction,and I requested Lieotenant Palliser to convey my thanks to his men for their services. 14. Dawk letters, I understand, arrived last night from Benares for the first time, and I trust that there will be no further interruption on this line. I am, &c", J. G.

These repeatod attacks upon our position, with the small force we have to repel them, are rendered most harassing by the uncertainty of the point on which it is to be threatened, it being always doubtful whether it Is to be confined to one and can only be successfully repulsed by the untiring and unifinohing gallantry of the small bodies who can alone be directed aainst the enemy, and I can assure you that under no crcumstanoes dld officers and men merit greater prase.

THB PENINSULAR MAILS. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Al. hambra, Captain J. IL Joy, arrlved at Southampton yester. day afternoon with the Peninsular mails, in charge of Lieutenant Payne, R.N., Admiralty agent. Her dates were:Gibraltar, October 6; Cadiz, 7; Lisbon, S; and Vigo, 11th. During the outward voyage the Alhambra had strong south-westerly winds, with a heavy sea crossing the Bay, and from Vigo to Gibraltar light breezes and fine weather; homewards moderate northerly vinds and fine, and cross' ing the Bay easterly winds with thick rain. This steamer brings 24 passengers, among whom Is Coun t George, late Austrian Minister at Lisbon; and on freight five packages of specie, value 1,3807., and a cargo of oranges, lemons, almonds, winre, and sundries. At Gibraltar a meeting was held on the 1st inst. in the public room of the Exchange to organize a committee for receiving subscriptions to aid the funds raising in London for the relief of the sufferers by the Indian rautinieg. Notice had been issued from the post-office that between the 1st October and 31st March the mails for England by the Penin6nlar packets wil be closed at 4 p.m. on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month, unless those dates fall on Sunday, In which case the maliwill be closed at 4 p.m. on Saturday. The Spanish general mail and the Estafeta wiU also be closed at 4 p.m. from 1st October to 31st March. Exchanges on the 3d were quoted as under :-London, 90 days' date, 50; Paris, 90 days' date, 5f. 38c.; MarseWles, 90 days' date, 6i. 39c.; Genoa, 90 days' date, 5f. 39c.; Madrid, eight days' sight, lJ dia; Cadiz, eight days' sight, i dis.; Malaga, eight days' sight, par; Seville, eight days' sight, g dia; Alicantc, eight days' sight, S die.; Valencia, eight days' sight, A dis.; Barcelona, eight days' sight, S dis. Spanish Pilared Dollarss 3S per cent. premium, none, and Carolus, 15 per cent., none, in demand. The British brig Come On, Captain B. Robinson, with wheat for Cork, from Taganrog and Constantinople, put into Gibraltar on the 4th, with loss of topmast, rigging, sails' and other damages. The British bark Princess, Captain R' Tomlinson, from Alexandria, with beans for Liverpool, arrived there on the same day, with her steering wheel, &c., carried away. The steamship Meander, 5A days from Liverpool, arrived at Gibraltar on the morning of the 6tb. From Cadiz there is no news of importance. When tho Alhambra left Lisbon at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 9th the Royal Mail packet Medway, expected from Brazil, had not arrived. There were no foreign ships of war In the Tagus when the Alhambra left. The Lisbon exchanges for biUs at three months aye quoted this packet-on L4ndon, 64 to 644, with little demand, and the rate generaly 64d. ; Paris, 527 to 628 ; Amsterdam, 421; Hamburg, 48k to 3; Genoa, 526. The stock-market continued dull.

Our correspondent states that business was very dull at Lisbon, many shops and merchants' houses having been closed In consequence of the fever which broke out in the neighbourhood of the Custom-house. It had recently spread to other parts of the city, and thus increased the daily cases to about 150, and 35 deaths. Black vomit had appeared in some instances, but the majority of Lisbon medical authori. ties did not consider it to be yellow fever, though the patients presented a yellow appearance. It was stiUl held to be typhus, aggravated by the pedslential sewers, and considered non-contagious. Although the number of cases had increased, in consequenee of the fever havlng spread about the city, the attacks were not so virulent, and the deaths reduced ftom one-third to one-fifth, the last buUetin being 183 cases and 35 deaths. The best medical authorities considered the disease would soon be extinct, Sut no rains had fallen heavy enough to eleanse the sewers, and the weather was still unseasonable. The steamships Ratter, of Liverpool, and Victor Emmanuel, of Glasgow, put in at Vigo, on the 10th inst., from stress of weather. Oat. 11, the Alhambra exchanged night signals off Cape Sissargus with the outward steamer, steering for Vigo, Thls steamer, the Granada, left Southampton on the 7th, but wasE compelled to bring up in Yarmouth-roads till the b ron fte 8th byv ths violenc-e of the galet

This was the examination meeting. Mr. Blake appeared for the assignees; Mr. Lucas for the bankrupt; andA Mr. Fleming for Air. Simpson, a creditor. Tne bankrapt, examined, said he purchased the Surrey Gardens in 1844 of Mr. Cross. The original price was 14,0001., but it was ultimately reduced to 11,5001., which was the sum he actually paid. Ia the purchasemoney was included some btock. There was no estimate made as to the value of the stcok on the premises. On buying the gardens he went upon no particular data. He considered that part of the lease hbd expired, and that there was still a long term to ruan. In calculating the purchasemoney he was guided prindpally by the amount of profits Mr. Cross had made during his occupation. EHe had no particular idea as to the amount realized by that gentle. man, but he made a very good thing of the Gardens. His profits were certanly 1,001. ayear, but they varied accordiug to the season. It was the value aud the character of the premises that he principally gave his money for. He did not then consider that the premises were rackrented; otherwise the purchase-money would not have been so large. NTearly th0e whole of the purchase-money 10, 2001., he thought) was borrowed from ir. James Cop. pock, and he received the lease of the Gardens and an agreement for their mortgage as security. Mr. Coppock had since been paid out of the shares received from the subse. quent sale of the Gardens. 11,0001. were due to Mr. ConD pock for principal and interest at the time of the sale of tfie Gardens. No account was furnished. The amount was taken from Mr. Coppock's verbal statement, and Mr. Coppock was paid by shares of the company. An assienment was thereupon executed to the company. The sale took place in l85. The agreement was made with the directors of the company, not with any of its shareholders. The companyw asnottheformed. The directors were to rive 14,0001. insharesofthecompany,which were then worth 101. each. He did not know who prepared the assignment of the premises to the company. It was executed at Mr.Coppock's office. The shares were divided between Mr. Coppock and himself. Eleven hundred shares were in Mr. Coppock's name and 300 shares in his. He had never received money at the door of the Gardens unless for a few minutes upon a special occasion. He had not had anything to do with the Gardens since his bankrnptcy, and he had not lately purchased an es-ate in Norfolk. He had been told that the deed executed was an assignment. He bad never had a solicitor. The bankrupt pused his examination. IN RB GBOBGE GULL. The bankrupt was a tallow broker, of 75, Old Broadstreet. His accounts show-creditorg, 3,5641.; ditto, for differences on tallow contracts, 2,7441. good debtors, 321. bad debtors, 1,6251. There is a statement that the bankrupt is liable to the British Sperm Candle Company, in respect of a contract entered into with him jointly with Mr. Charles Hulse, of Staines, and Mr. William Wilkinson, solicitor, of LUncoln's-inn-fields, for the purchase of the plant of the premises known as Fairfield Candle Works, Bow, for the sum of 33,0001.; and that the said premises had cost the British Sperm Candle Company 68,0001. three or four years previously; and that in consequence of a disagreement among the proprietors they had been purchased for this reduced umn The premises wvere bought with the intention of forming a Company to carry them on, and a deposit of 10 per cent. on the purchase-money had been paid, half by the bankrupt and the other half by Messrs. Wilkinson. An adjournment was ordered that inquiry might be made iu respect of this transaction. lUr. Sydney appeared for the assignees and hfr. Chidley for the bankrupt.
AIIDDLESE SESSIONS, Oct 14. The Court sat to-day at Clerkenwell, to tsLke bail cases in arrear. Mr. Bliss, Q.C., the Attorney.General of the Duchy of Lancaster, presided, under the sancion of the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment, for the learned AssistantJudge, who, though recovering from a severe and dangerous IhlneES, ;s still in such a state of health as will preclude his resuming his duties for some tume. Diedrich Rathgen,* carpetbag manufacturer, ws indicted vor having assaulted Hngh Brady and George Quinley, two police-constables, in the execution of their duty. r. hhLangford appeared for the prosec¢ution; Mr. Sleigh Brady, 186 HI, stated that on the morning of the 9th ofuly he wason duty in George-street, Spitalfields, when, about 3 o'clockinthe morning, he heard F noise, Which proceeded from the defendant and others, who were shouting and quarrelling, On his int3rfering the defendant was most conspicuous in obstructing him in his efforts to get them away, and struck him a blow on the head which stunmed him, and then ran Into his house and procured a poker, the others beating him while he fetched it. When defendant returned he strack witness with the poker, and faid, " You - I shall do for you;" and as he continued to strike complainant with the poker he at length drew his staff and used it about defendant's head. Another constable came to his assistance, and the defendant then raninto the house. They parsued him, and eventnally lodged him at the station. He was then bleeding from his head. He could not say how many times he struck him on the head with his truncheon. In croes-examination he said he had only been on that beat a few days, and he had not prior to the altercation called any woman a prostitute. Two women were with the defendant. He did not recollect the defendant saying that le would take his number, or that he (witness) said, upon hearing anything to that effect, that he would be first with hin if that was what he meant. The other constable, George Quinley, 125 H., said he went to the assistance of Brady on hearing the disturbance, when one of the women who were with the defendant said he (Brady) had thrown her cape over her head and insulted her. He saw the defendant hit the constable, who had, he said, called his wife a prostitute. In the scuffle he received a knock on the nose with the poker, and he saw Brady follow defendant into his house. Blows took place, and when he came out defendant and another person were bleeding from the headL He heard the defendant say he would take the officer's number, but at what part of the affray he could not telL Witness received a biow on the back of the head which gave him great pain. The witnesses were cross-examined by Mr. SLuiou, but they did not deviate from their statements in any material particular. Mr. SLiGH, In his address to the jury, said he should prove that Brady had insulted defendanb's wife by pulling her cape over her head and caling her a prostitute In the public streets, as Mr. Rathgen and his friends were returning from a party, which was corroborated by the evidence of the second constable. It was a most infamous case. Mr. Adams, house surgeon at rhe London Hospital, said the defendant had been under treatment at that institution for wounds on the head such as would he produced by blows He was an in-patient 12 days, and was not discharged, but left of his own accord, to join his family. His life was in danger some time, and he was not cured when he left. Emma Roberts.-I live at 16, Little Sutton-street, and am sister-in-law to the defendant. On the morning of the 9th of July I was with him and some friends, returning from a party, and I went home with them. There was a little girl, 14 years of age, with us. We saw Brady, the policeman, on duty. We said nothing to him. He laid hold of my sister's cape and pulled it over her head, and she asked him what he did that for. He said he did not, and he told her to go on or he would lock her up, as she was only out for the purposes of prostitution. The defeudant, attracted by this, came up, and my sister said to Brady, " You are here to protect, and not to insult respectable people." She told defendant that she had been insulted by Brady, and, he told her to come home, and he would report hir the next morning. Ratbgen had not struck Brady when Quinley came up. Mly gister told him Brady had insulted her. We went indoors and shut the gate after us. A young man stood at the gate and tried to prevent the police entering, as they were attemptlng to do so. and 185 hit him on the head. They said, " We wifi lock some of you up yet." They broke open the gate and rushed in. The defendant had his pocketbook in his hand and said he would take their numbeTs. They struck him about the head as he stood on the mat. The defendant had neither stick nor poker in his hand; nothing but his pocketbook. He cried " Murder !" and they went away, but came back again, and they and the defendant went to the station. My brotber-in-law has lived in the same house in King's Arms court for four years. The jury stopped the case and said that after such evidence for the defence it would be useless to go on. Mr. LA.SOGroRD claimed and exercised his right of reply. The learned JUDGE was about to sum up, when The jury said they were quite satisfied, and found the defendant NV'ot Guilty. Mr. SLEIGH said a prosecution for perjury most certainly ought to follow this flagrant case Josiah Lyall was indicted for stealing. a gelding, value 2c., the property of PhiLip Pound. A man named Crawle, who has absconded, was included is the indictment. Yr. F. Smith prosecuted; Mr. Meicalfe appeared for the p.ilsoner. The man Crawley was in the service of the prosecutor, a contractor living at Bow, and on the 1st of July a gelding was stolen from a field of his at Bromley. Lyall and Crawley acted jointly In selling the animal, but Crawley took the money. Lyall voluntrily gave himself up to the police wben he heard they were in search of him, and stated that, although he certainly was with Crawley when the horse was sold, he knew nothing of its being stolen, and Crawley a week before bad asked him to go with him to sel a horse. This was the defence set up, and The jury Aczuiucel the prioner. There were several prosecutions against brothel keepers at the instance of the parochial authorities of St. Luke's. The houses indicted were situate in New-court, Goswell. The defendants were sentenced to two mouths' bard labour each, and to enter into recognizancesto be of good behaviour for one year. (Before Mr. CRIUSY.) Charlotte Chandler, a respectable-looking woman, the wife of a lighteman, ;was indicted for receiving a aiece of brown holland and other articles, the property of- ron well knowing them to be stolen. Charlotte Chandler hr danghter, a child 10 years of age pleaded ",Guity" of haYigg solen them. Mr. Cooper prosecuted; Mfr.

Isformation having been received by the prosecutor, 5~ ihuendraper, that the girl had committed a theft at his shop, the informant being a boy who told ia consequence of hts not baing received a portion of the property, he went to the mother's house, No. 6, Christian-8treet, with an officer, when, In answer to inquiries respecting the articles, which were found in a box in her room, she mado contradictory statements but tiere was nothing in the evidence to show that she haci any knowledge of the articles being in the box befoTe they were found there by tho officer in the prose. cuter's presence. However, she was given in charge and had now to take her trial. Upon the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, Mr. CORisy said there was no legal evidence of receiving by the mother. The younger prisoner, who he was sorry to find was so wicked, might have put the articles there with<ut her mother's knowledge. There was no ovidence to contravene that assumption; how, therefore, could the jury convict her? The jury Acquitted the mother. Mr. CREASY said he should defer the sentence on the girl until he had caused some inquiries to be made as to the probability of her being admitted to a reformatory institution. Joseph Smith, a young man, was iDdicted for having com. mnitted an aggravxted assault upon a brewer's drayman, named Thomas HilL Mr. Poland prosecuted; Mr. Cooper appeared for the defendant. There was gross perjury in this case on one side or the other. The prosecutor stated that onIe night he was passing through Corbett's-court, Spitalfields, when he saw the defendant intoxicated, leaning against a waUl, apparently ill. He said to him, " Haloa, mate, what is up . upon which he turned round, and having asked what that was to do with him-not in the most refined language-knocked him down, and kicked him about the head while he was down. When he got up the defendant pushed him to the bottom of the court, and then again threw him down and repeated the kicking. He was laid up for seven days, and had a wound over the right eye, which was dressed at the hospital. Two young men, one of whom had been in custody for picking pockets, gave evidence corroborating the pro. Eecttor as to the kieking. The defence was that it was a fair stand-u fight, and that the prosecutor got his eye hurt through failing against a wall in making a heavy blow at the defendant, who had more skill as a boxer than the drayman, and got out of the way, and the latter fell forward, baving missed his aim. The defendant had been out for a day's plea. sure with his sweetheart, a young woman named Sarah Berry, and on returning home had to pass the court w here the affray took place. He left her for a minute, and while she was waiting the prosecutor went u to her and made use of an expression so filthy and abominable that she refused to repeat it. She told him to 5o about his business, but the defendant had overheard the expression, and, coming up, said if he repeated it he would give him in charge. The prosecutor repeated it, with a little addition, and struck him a blow on the nose. Smnith then threw off his hat, sparred up to his silant, and they bad a fair "give and take" fight, as one of the witnesses termed it. The drayman fell twice, but, finding he had got the worst of it, took his departure, and the defendant took his yonng w;oman by the arm and went hose. This was deposed to ,y the young woman and two other witnesses, and they not only swore tat the prosecutor was not kicked, but that the two witnesses who had sworn that they saw it done were not there at alL. Mr. CRY.sy said the jury would have to say which side they thought the truth lay upon. The only question was, did the defendant kick the prosecutor while he was down i If he did, that was anassault, and a bad one too; bat upon the evidence as to the fighting there was no pretenco for a charge of assault. The jury Acquittse the defendant. Eliza Hunt, the keeper of a marine storeshop, was indicted for feloniously receiving a number of pewter-pots, knowing them to have been stolen. She surrendered. Mr. Sleigh prosecated for the Licensed Victunaler' Protection Society; Ur. Horry and Mr. Orridge appeared for the prisoner. A worse case of receiving than this could not be well imagined. The prisoner kept a shop in Victoria-grove, Cambridge.heath.road, which was the ready receptaae for pnbllcang' pots which had been stolen. Three boys pleaded guilty last seesion of stealing pots which they sold to the prisoner, who asnowr convicted of receiving them, but, as the sentence on the boys was not yet passed, hers was deferred also.

Prisoner.-I didn't say " oods as security ," .t said good security for the things had had of him." Mr. Goodman, the chief clerk, then proceeded to read over the voluminous depositions, which were signed by the witnesses, and the prisoner, who said he should reserve his defence, was fully commiitted for trial at tho Central Criminlal Court. Charles Stewart Mills, a young man of about 20 years of age, formerly clerk to Mlr. AT. 2Hewitt, a solicitor practising in Nicholas-lane, Lombard-streot, was brought up in custody of Huggett, the detective officer, charged with having forged a check for 2501., with intent to defraud his Mr. Mulleas, sollcitor to the Committee of Bankers for Protection from Forgeries and Frauds, attended on the part of the prosecution. Mr. J. Lett sald,-Iam clerk to Messrs. Hankey and Co., the bankers. On the 13th of June last the check produced was presented to me over the counter. It purports to be drawn by Arthur T. Hewitt, who keeps an account at our house. It is dated the 12th of June, and is payable to Mr. Farley, its amount being 2501 I paid it to A youth whom I knew to be in the employment of the prosecutor. The prisoner is dressed so differently (he wore a midshipman's uniform) thatl do not recognize him. I paid the check in a 1001.-note, dated the 10th of February and numbered 34,139, two 5O1.-notes dated February 9 aud numbered 35,698 and 40,030, and 501. in gold. Mr. A. T. Hewitt, the prosecutor, said,-The check produced is not in my handwriting, nor was it written by my authority. The prisoner had been in my service as clerk for about 12 months, and was so on the day of the date of the check. He left me on Saturday, the 13th of June writhout any notice, since which time I never saw him till to-day, when he was in custody. The check has been abstracted from my own check-book. The signature to the check is a good imitation of my handwriting. J. Huggett. -I this morning took the prisoner Into custody at a coffeeshop in Farringdon-street. I proceeded upstairs and found him in bed. I told him that I was an officer of the city police, and had come for the purpose of apprehending him upon a charge of forging a check for 2501. on Messrs. Eankey's bank. HIe replied, " I don't under. stand you." I told him that he must dress himself and go with me. While dressing he said to me, "I confes I know something about the check you mention, but I have not committed the forgery." Upon the application of Mr. Mullens the prisoner was remanded. John Briley and James Pritchett, the former a greengrocer, the latter a brushmaker in an extensive way of business in Kent-street, Soathwark, were brought up upon remand, charged, the one with stealing a box of French bristles, of the value of 801., the other with receiving the prorty, well knowing it to have been stolen. Mr. Wontner appeared in support of the prosecution; and Mr. Lewis, jun., defended the two prisoners. The evidence adduced at the last examination was to the effect that on the 30th ult. a box of French bristles was stolen from the premises of the prosecutors, Messrs, Joseph and Turner. The police were immediately communicated with, and handbills giving a description of the stolen property, and offering a reward of 251. for its recovery and the apprehension of the thieves, were sent to the different brushmakers of the metropolis. G. Watkins, a police-constable, No. 160, called, among other places, at the premises of Pritchett, into whose hands he placed one of the handbills. Pritchett looked at the bill, smiled, and Faid nothing. In consequence of information which reached the prosecutors, their managing clerk, Mr. Cohen, accompanied by the officers Watkins and Brown, visited the premises of Pritchett on the night of the 5th inst., taking with them B3riley, who lived opposite Pritchett. When questioned respecting the bristles, Pritchett declared that he had not possession of them, although he admnitted having had samples of them. Mr. Cohen, not satisfied with this denial, ordered the officers to search the premises, and on their proceeding to the rear of the warehouse they found Pritchett's foreman In the act of burying a tub in the earth, a hole having been dug for its reception. The tub vas forthwith exhumed, and upon Its head being driven in with a crowbar a large quantity of French bristles, part of the robbery, was aiscovered. Briley admitted that he bad carted a bag of brlstles from a house in Brick-lane to Pritchett's premises shortly after the robbery. The prisoners were then taken into custody. Yesterday Mr. J. Isaac Cohen, the managiing clerk to the prosecutors, was called. His evidence was a repetition, but of a more detailed character, of that of which the above is the substance. In answer to Mr. Lewis, the witness said that Briley afforded the officers every possible facility to search his premises. Mr. Wontner asked for a remand, in order that the witness who pocked the box might be brought from Paris. Mr. Lewis made an earnest appeal to the Lord Mayor to accept bail for the prisoners. Te LORD MAYOR said he could not accede to the application. The prisoners were then remanded.

It was understood upon the Last examination that noaddi. tional evidence would be gone into nntil Wednesday next The particulars of what has transpired in reference to this large fraud, which has excited much interest, have already met with insertion at some length In our paper. The prisoners were remanded once more to the House of Detention, and on the day above alluded to-viz., next Wednesday, other evidenoe will, it is expected, be forth. coming, and the accused persons will then be committed for trial. LAmBPr-A stylishly-dressed young woman, who gave the name of Mary Ann Jonew, vas charged before Mr. ELLIoTT nwith passing a 51. forged note of tho Bank ot En gland. Thomas Gray, an engineer, deposed that on the afternoon of the 28th of July last he was at the Towerppublichouse in the Weetmin6ter.road, wrhenthe prisoner, who was a perfect stranlger tohim, came in, and spoke to his two children, eho wrere with him. She asked them if they knew their prayers, or could read Watte's Hymns, and from her conversation and manner he believed her to be a respectable person. She called him on one side, after speak. Ing to the children for some time, and asked him if he could procure her change for a 5I.-note, saying she waa some distance from her home and without change, and believing her, as he before said, to be a respectable woman, he toot the note from her and got changc from the landlord. The prisoner then accompanied him home, at his invitation, and had some tea with his family, and she subsequently treated himself and his children to the Victoria Tbeatre. She ultimately took her leave of him and his children, and romised to call again, but she forgot the promise, and he d not we her again until the evening before, when he met her by accident, and gave her Into custody. The witness added that he himsef had been taken up on a charge of wilfuly pa6sing the n te, but was released fiom custody on account of his character and the representation as to how he was drawn into it, and promising to pay the amount at os. a.week.- Police constable Edward Newton said the prisoner was given into his custody by the last witnes, and in reply to the charge she said she was not are when giving Gray the note that it was a forgery, and that she got it from a gentleman who hod been In her company. The prisoner said the3e were the facts, and she was re* mnandea for further examination to Tnesday next. Susan Humby, another young woman of apparently the same class, was charged with pasing a 101 forged Bank oE England note to the shopman of Mr. George J. Toby, a boot and shoe manufacturer in Wellington.sereet, Londonbridge. In this case it appeamd that on Mond-y last the prisoner called at the shop of Mr. Toby with a wntten list of goods, which she said she wanted, and directed that they might be sent to Cavendish-terrace, Wandsworth-road, where Bhe said they were going to set up a shop, and gave the name of Stephens. The goods were sent, as directed, with a bill for their amount, 101 4s., and in payment she gave the shopman rho brought it a 10-note. This Mr. Toby paid into the Bank on the same evening, and on the following day received it back with the word " forgery" stamped upon it. Mr. Toby at once proceeded to the house In Cavendish. terrace and tound it emplty, but, by diligent inquiries, he traced the prisoner to 5, Gray's-place, George-street, Lambeth, and gave her into custody. T'he prisoner, in reply to the charge, said she got the note from a person named Ste pens, with whom she had been living, and was not are that It was a bad one. Mr. Toby informed the magistrate that the prisoner had passed a second 104 note to a neighbouring tradesman, which had onlybeen paid into the Bankon the evening before, so that there was not sfficient time for its return, if a forgery, which he strongly uspected it was, and therefore sugested a remand for a few dass. ir. ELLioTr remanded the prisoner to Tuesday next, [when both prisoners wll be again brought up.

THE EA JAH OF PUTTEZA LA. TO THIE EDITOR OF THEF TIMES. Sir, -At a time when almost universal mistrust and sus. picion is felt with respect to the loyalty of the population of the North- WVest Provinces of India, and so many Zernindars rnd lajahs have in different places thrown off their allegiance and joined the inutineers, it Is right to acknowledge with gratitude the noble conduct of those native independeut princes who have shown themselves steadily our friends, and afforded us active assistance from the first outbreak of this terrible rebe,lion. Among these no one has stood more conspicuously forward than the Rajah of Putteeala, the ruler of an independent state contiguous to lhmibaliah, of which and the surrounding district my brother, Mr. DouglasForsyth, is the Deputy Commi-sioner. f he territory of the Patteeala Raj 3h is of considerable size-I believe as large as Yorkshire, if not larger,-and he maintains a body of troops which may almost be called au army. About three years ago he wished to visit England with a large retinue, and my brother was the officer appointed by the Governor-General of India to accompany him. Some of his attendants actually came over, and it was one of them who is mentioned in a letter that lately appeared in your culU uns as having been heard to say, while guarding a post near Delhi against the insurgent Sepoys, " Ah ! they would know the power of England better if they had ever been in Vere-street, Oxford-street." The Rajah hlmself, however, did not proceed further than Calcutta, as, for reasons which it is not necessary now to mention, he abandoned his intention to coule to England. In a letter which I have iust received from my brother at Umbalab h he says "The Rajah has s-hown himself sucha stanch and valuable ally that I am only doing him justico in endeavouring to bringhim bofore thoBritishpablic. It isawell-acknowledged fact that if it had not been for the Rajah of Patteeala none of us in these eis-Sutlej States would now be alive. ' On the first news of the Delhi and Meerxt massacres I sent for himu, anld oallod for his aid, wbich he furnished in the most promipt ulmaner. The presence of 1,000 or 1,800 men was essential to) our safety here, and he gave the mon at once. Since then he has been foremost in taking all the onerous duty of guarding the out stations, furnishing escort' for convoys of stores, protecting the country, cutting off straggkrs, and even in recovering districts which had fallen i:lto the hands of the rebels. Moreover, he has lent us 40,000l., and will give more as we require it. His princely generosity to the survivors of the Iansi and Hissar massacres deserves to be publicly known. He not only sent out men to hunit for fugitives, and cover their retreat, but on their arrival in his territory he furnished them with e verything-money, food, clotbing, 2cc.,-and gave a general order that whatever they should call for was to be at once .-ipplied gratis. Comminon gratitude would make us anxious to do anything to serve oa- ally, and I very willingly now take uip his caise. l{e has no grievance to be redressed, but as in these days people are too apt to suspect every native of hostility to us, ;t is not surprising that disparaging remarks should now and then be made, and one or two suspicions of his fidelity have found their way into print, and greatly disquieted the Rtjah. lio is most anxious to show his friendliness and to have it believed. He has been conferring with me, and expressed great fear lest through the representations of his enernies he should suffer. . . . I have done my utmost to reassure him, and have promised to do my utmost to place before the British public a statement of his services." I trust, Sir, that you wiU think with me that the wish of the Putteeal4 Rajah to have his name and servios made known is a reasonable one. Nothing is more likely to rivet the friendship of the independent princes of India at this awful crisis than the knowledge that such conduct as he has shown is appreciated as it deserves In England. I know froum other sources hovw deep and widespread is their fear. lest their do:ninious should be swallowed up in the all devouring gulf of annexation, and, of course, there are no' wanting in Indfa numbers of enemies of our rule to suggest to them that their ouly privilege will be to be devoured last, Every effortismadeby therebels to gettheindependentR ajahon their side, and the least we can do is to show our grateful sense of their services when they resist the temptation, and to inspire them with confidence with reepect to our policy towards them in future. The Putteeala Eajah will, I know, feel that he has his highest reward in the conviction that his devotion to our cause in the hour of adversity has met with due acknowledgement in England; and his desire to havo his fidelity proclaimed is not without reason, for I have myself seen in print more than one injurious suspicion cast upon his good faith. He has proved himself a warm and steady friend, when our empire around him seemned to be cunmhling into dust, and we ought by every means in our power to show that we are not unmindfil of his services. This will not only reassure him, but encourage others; and who shall say that we may not yet find one of our strongest sources of strength and support to be the active friendship of the independent Princes of India ? My brotber mentions also in terms of high praise the cnduct of the Itajah of Jheend, a relative and neighbour of the Rajah of P,stteeala. Flo says :-"This chief, though of lesser note, hps done his duty well and nobly, and held the country to the rear of our camp from the commence. niient of our attack on Delhi." He, like the PutteealaRajah, is Pt Sikh, but their territories are at the eastern extremity of the cis-Sutlej States, and therefore tbey are peculiarly accessible to tho influences at work in the North-West. Provinces, from which, indeed, the 9atteeala Rajah is divided by a merely imaginary line. Your obedient se,-f. W. FORSYTH. OL, Aullancl-gate, Oct. U.

METROPOLITAN1 BOA tD OF WORKS. ZAUlS DRAINAGE OF TfRE :WTROPOT-TI. A meeting of the Board was held yesterday in the Coemtt. chaitber, Guildhall, to further consider the com'aunioat.oa receiv-ed from the First Commissioner of Her Hrr sa1y's WVorks, C;c,, in relatio.n to the main drainage, of the s:ctrop Airs; Mfr. Thwaites in the chair. Afiter some explanations on certain lengineering points had been given by Ir. Basaigette, the eneineer of the Board,- Mr. CARP5.raEL rose to move t+4t the X sorts` of the B)ard submitted to the Gomenissioner of Hier Majestys works and public buildings, also the repozt of Messrs. Galton, Simpson, and Blackwell, be referred to two eminent engineers, and the engineer of the Board to report thereon at their earliest oonvenience. 'tsbe chief cemmissioner had returned the plan B5 submitted to him by the Board accompanied with a report which had been prepared under his direction by three eminent engineers, and he had invited the Board to well consider that report. It wonld appear from that report that these eminent gentlemen by whom is was prepared were of opinion that the Board had not arrived !.t a wise and proper conclusion on the subject. But in order to ascertain the value of the propositions of those civil engineers it was desirable to see first wherein those gentlemen differed from the Board. They eterted witl stating that they themselves had based their plans upon the same principle as that adopted by the engineer of the Board; and they farther stated that no other principle oould with propriety be used in carryiog out this great work. The Board therefore was justified so far as the principle of their pil&a was concerned. Subject to certain suggestions and rmoditications, they likewise approved other portions of the plan propounded by the Board; especially that of having a high-level sewer on the north and south sides of the Thames. They agree as to the expediency of a low-level sewer on the southern, but they diff&r as to the propriety of having a low-level sewer on thenorth side of the Thames. They also agree to the want of two middle-level sewers, bat they propose to have these constructed so as to get the bewn-Ft of a larger area, and to carry the sewage into the Thatues by the simple act of gravitation. They propose to carry the sewage across the Thames at Battersea, there to be raised by artificial means into a southern high-level sewer, so as to arrive at the Thames by gravitation. In these several respects the Board and the referees were largely agreed. It must not therefore be supposed that because Sir B. Hall had sent back plan B* he disagreed with it in loto, because his own engineers did not do that. He believed that the plan of the Board had come back from, the First Commissioner stamped with a degree of credit that no engineering plan of like dimensions had ever before received. It had not only met with the approval to a great extent of those three enminent referees themselves, but it had also the support of Sr. Foster, Sir W. Oubitt, and xr. Stephenson, who were formerly Commissioners of Sewers, as far as regarded the principle upon which that plan was based. Was the board then prepared at once to accept the engineering propositions of DIessrs. Galton, Sialpson, and BlackweLll He did not believe that any man would do SO. But, if not, was the Board prepared, on the other hand, to take the responsibility upon them of rejecting those propositions without making any engineering inquiry 1 ie thought not. The First Commissioner had requested the Board to take the report of the Government referees into consideration, not becauge he himself approved their suggestions- for in regard to them he had expressed no opinion,-but because it was, as he believed, the wish of that right hon. gentleman to have so great a national work executed in the best possible manner. All the propositions of the referees de "ended upon the possibility of their having one outfall sewer; 18 Rliles long, with a fall of six inches a-mile. If they could not carry out that portion of their plan, then all those parts of It which had reference to a larger area, for the purpose of conveying the sewage by gravitation and to a larger rainfall, must fall to the ground. It was, therefore, to that point-namely, the practicability of such an outf4l sewer-that he invited the attentioa of the Board. Their proposition was this-the formation on either side of the Thames of an open cutting which they caUed the main outfall channels. Each of these channels was to be 1l feet deep and 38 feet wide, with a general fall of 6 inches in a mnile. That would be able to carry away all enormous amount of sewage and rainfall. The report of the referees, though exceedingly voluminons on matters of information which anybody might have collected, wa very meagre when it c-.me to practical facts. It was no' known whether those three eminent engineers propo-ed t X have gates at t! e end of their outfall channels or not. They stated that the cuttings would commence near Barking on the north side, and near Woolwich on the south side. The top of the channel on the Woolwich side would be level with Trinity high-water mark, and the top of the north side cutting would be 6 Inches above Trinity high-water mark. It was said that these cuttings would extend to Sea Reach wzith a fall of 6 inches a msile; hut, strange to saY, when they came within four miles of Sea Reach, the fall was at the rate orly of I foot 6 inches per salle. The consequence of this woiild hb that from 10 to 13 feet of water would be constan.tly 13 ing at the bottom of the sewer, and be washed up and down with the tide 'or a distance of 12 miles. These channels would, moreover, be tide-looked, for there were inverts 28l feet on one side of the river and 29& on the other side below Trinity high-water. As shown by their own diagrams and sections, the low-water mark was from 10 to 13 feet above the inverts. The consequence would be that the sewers would never empty themselves. But then these gentlemen proposed, in order to increase the current, to take water in from the river at bigh water and from the reservoirs to be constructed at the upper end into their outfall channels. First, then, it was proposed by them to tako water into their reservoirs and then to let the water in the reservoirs run Into the channels. Bnt the report was altogether silent as to the depth of these reservoirs. The eDgineer of the Board had here detected a great fallacy on which these gentlemen had founded their scheme. The whole question rested upon this,-what were to be the size and depth of ti,c reserv.irs 9 At present the top of the outfall channel on one side was on a level with Trinity highwater mark, aid on the other side six inches above that mark. Now, the spring tides at Woolwich were coincident with Trinity high-water mark ; it was quite clear, therefore, that they could not take in any water at highwater mark-that was to say, at spring tides. The neap tides were sometimes lower than Trinity high. warter mark, and sometimes as much as fivefeet higher. When lower thatt high-water mark the depth of the outfall sewer must be considerably reduced. Bat the whole faUacy of the plan was fancying that it was possible for them to get an altitude at WVoolich with a constant higher head of water than they had in the river here, from which they had to derive it. It was aoite clear, in an engineering point of view, that if they had an altitude affording a high head of water they would always drive out every particle of sewago from the open channels. Butk as they were dependent upon the Thames for obtaining that altitude, they could only get it as the Thames could bring it to them, and the Tbames could not bring them a constant head of high water under any circuimstances whatevor. Supposing the reservoirs were deep enough to keep up an altitude of head water at spring tides, and supposing they had no gates at the outfalls, the tide would rise to the same height ia tue outfall sewers as it did in the Thames; and the sewage would flow just as freely in the Thamnes as in the outf&ll channels; there would be no head water in favour of tho-e cuttings. But, although he was bimself convinced by these reasoning8, yet be did not exPect the Board to adopt his conclusions without inquiry. He could not ask them to oomue to a resolution that the scheme propounded by the Government referees was based on a fallacy. He could only ask them to cail in further professional aid, who would luveiti. gate the scheme and report whether the engineers who had propounded it were right or whether what he had been stating was correct. The plans of the Board had been recommended to them by their own engineer, for whose skill and judgment he entertained the highest respect, and he (Mr. Carpmael) having himself inYestigated those plans, he had arrived at the conviction that Mr. Bazazgetto possessed more practical knowledge in details, and was better acquainted with the principles having reference to this particular question, than any other man now living. (Cheers.) He was delighted to hear that a copy of the planof the engineer of this Board had been sent by the referees of the Government to all the district engineers for their opinion as to its efficacy in reference to their particular district4, and that out of the 40 gentlemen, all men of talent, who constituted that body, not one had objected to the broad principle of the plan. (Hear, hecr.) Seven of the number had not given any answer to the circular; six had suggested certain alterations ia details for the convenience of their particular districts; and 26 of those gentlemen had entirely accepted the plan, sa3ing that, in their opinion, it was amply sufficient to carry out the great work of the Board. He would ask them wbether it was not the fact that their plan had come back to them with a degree of credit and of stability with which no pian of any foramer ewineer had ever been honourei. Under these cireumstances he subnmitted that the only proper course for the Board to take was, since their plan had been returned, togsther with a report, from the three engineers to whom its consideration had been referred by Sir B. Hall, to call in further professional skill; and should the persons so called in concur with what he had now stated it would then be the duity of the Board to wait upon Sir B. Hall, and state t, him that they adhered to their owr plan, and would leave it for him to decide whether he would support the recommendations of his own referees or the plan which the Board then submitted to him. The hon, geatleman concluded by moving the following resolution TOSS the re -nrts of this Baird sabmit:ed to the omuniaasioneres of ere Mejesty's Works and Poblis B sUdIndin also tha. re rS of Mesus. Galtoll, Si lpson and BL:csKwel, be refcre to two eminent et gineer t and the ensiuer of this Board, to rept thereon at their e,rl y envenisnos.' Major LYoss seconded the motion. He could scarcely do less, seeing that it was precisely to the same effect as the molion he himself proposed as long ago as February, 1856. The loss of all the time that had since elapsed was much to he regretted; hut it was now inevitable, and the only course the Board had to pursue was that now proposed by his bon. friend. It was iinpossible for the First Commissioner to accept a plan whicl I-hrose profeasional gentlemen to whom it had been referred fourcld wanting, Neither Parliatment nor the country would have been satisfied had the First Commissioner givea his sanction to the plan of a single engineer. HAving a very important work in hand which, when completed, would last for hundreds of years, he hoped the Board would, even at the expense of a little of their ffcuialedignitgy,achcede to the motion, in order that no more valabl tme `igt be lost. IMr. W RIM.IIT rose to lay a counter proposition before the Board. Agreeing as he did with many of the observations made by his friend Mr. Carpmael still he thought the ourse he had proposed was not the beat that could be adopted. He apprehended that the first duty of the Board was to ascertain how far the two schemes differed. He believed that on exanination it would be found that they differed in very few particulars in which an engineer could help them. The most impo-tant difference arose as to the point to which the sewage shoould be carried down the river. The Government engineers required the Board to take it down to a point which tPes Board had ail along admitted was desirable, and to which point, if thoy had had money, theyw ould have carried it. This wa3 not a question to b e ferred to two eminent engineers. Thc next point of difference was the extension of area. The Government eng,ieerg recoimmended a larger area, but the Beard had no 13ower under the Act of Parliament to adopt the recommeadation. It was true they might go to P'arliament for an etilargement of their powers; but the public would lo sk with great jealousy it any such step were taken by tha Board. Having disposed of these two points, thero were only three other points of difference to be considerel. tue of theso was the carryingof the drainage acros sfrom the Mliddlesexto the burrey side of the Thames. His own private opinion had always been favourable to such a scheme althougbl he had not before declared it. But it migh; be a fairly contested point with engineers whether it was wise and advisable to mske a drainage large enough to carry the sewage through the heart of the city of London. Another poit was the proposed increased dimensions of the sewers. l hitherto the sewers had been considered by mnany engineers too large; by others they were thought to be the right size; but now, for the first time, they were held by the Gove-nment engineers to be too small. The object of enlarging the sewers was to provide for an increase of rainfall; but that was not an engineering question. Tho only advantage to be gained by the proposed enlargement of the sewers to inc tde more storm waters was that it would prevent the overflow of the storm waters into the river on from 10 to 12 rainy days in the year more than by the plan of the Board. But this he repeated was entirely a business I matter, and not one to be referred to an engineer. There was one other point of difference. The Government engi;eers intercepted the metropolitan sewage by gravitationfrom a larger area, and ata considerable lower leveL That was certainly an engineering question, but fortunately tho plan by which this was proposed to be done was so impracticable that no que2tion would be raised upon it; for no man would tell him that it required an engineer to decide whether there should be open or covered sewers. He had thus noticed all the points of difference between the Board and the Government eDgineers, and he believed that if they went about the matter like men of business they would have no occasion to refer anything to professional engineers. He thought it would be nmuch better to have an interview with Sir B. HaU to ascertain whether the few points of difference might not be arranged and adjusted in an amicable spirit. The Board owed a duty to the public. Every district board was at the present moment actively at workpatting fresh soil into the river Thames. The tidal i power of the river was not larger, though the quantity of sewage was becoming larger n-very day. No doubt certain classes of disease were increasing. The cholera was travelling through Sweden, Denmark, and Hamburg, and nothing was so likely to engender diseases of that character as the particular miasma arising from sewace-water surging up the Thames, especially at this season o? the year when the air l was so moist. Every hour was of importnce, and he there- fore begged to move the following resolution, which, if carried, would require the appointment of a committee to carry the object of it into effect:- "That this Biard regrets that the First Cinmmileoner of Her Majoety'sWorks bas rejected thePlanBe withoutcommunlc tingt3 the Board the reawon fur its rajection. ! That tbta Bar.d with the assetiance of its engineer, has catafully considered the scheme propoaed by the referees appointed by the FL-t Oomramtsioner so fAr as the materials fmlntsh-d have ensbed them, and thas, whife entertaining great raspect for th3 emtnent engineers osun!ted by thte First Ooramnisloner, it his arrired at the conclnuson thAt the scheme torooed by them cinuot be adopted by the Board. "That this fliard while it regrets the further deiLy in carrying out the great sanitary work of the main drainage, is grstided to fiud by the report of the referees that they have adopted the principles of the plan of this Board al a basis for their seheme, notwithstanding the lawitude of investigation given to them in their instructions bh the First Conmulseoner, and th,t the differences op7n this important question are now reducel bt a few tangible points, viz.:- Reeemmaudatlocs which thia Beard hae no power to carry into effect.

"A 1 rge increse in the dimensions of sewers to provide mainly for an increased ares and rainfalL" Mr. TURNER seconded the amendment and thought it yoseessed a great advantage over the course proposed by Mr. I arprnaul. The oojections that existed against open sewers he d4emed to be utterly condemnatory of the whole plau of the Government referees. The points of difference between the two plans were not very serious, but still they were such ! as he tbought might be made the subject of conference with Sir B. a. The original resolution and the amendment having been red by the eecretary, Mr. Deputy HARRISON pointed out the pamsage in the amendment in which it was stated that the Board, with the assistance of its engineer, had carefully considered the scheme proposed by the referees, and Lad come to the conclusion that it could be adopted. What sort of examination bad the Board had with the assistance of the engineer ? To a question put to Mr. Bazalgette the other day as to whether he had examined the plaa or not, his answer was that he was not able to do so because he had not any information upon the subject. It was from a full conviction that it was the duty of the Board to examine the plan of the Government engineers with the greatest possible care that he most readily supported the original resolution. The Aot I of Parliament distinotly said that the Board must initiate a p plan. At present the Board had no plan to submit to the rirst COmmissioner, and he very much feared, unless they immediately set about prepsring one, the conclusion of the public woulid be, that they had not the oapacity to prepare a plan s'. all. Mr. Ho-ws had no apprehension that Sir B. Hall would think the Board had not the capacity of dealing with this great question; he was of opinion that the Board had already shown its capacity for the task. Had Sir B. Hall possessed the advantage which that Board enjoyed of having a legally appointed engineer, ho did not think there would have been any reference to three eminent engineers. Mr. CRsLLiN was opposed both to the resolution and the amendment, and contended that it was the duty of the Board to institute an inquiry as to the practicability of converting the sewage into a marketable manure. Mr. DxN;is supported the original motion. As to open sewers,they would never be tolerated. He believed that before the main drainage of the metropolis was fully carried out it would cost in round numbers not less than 10,000,0001. of money. Supposing the two open ditches were made they would at some future period have to be covered over, and that would make up the 10,000,O01. Mr. H. L. TAYLOR thought it would be unbecoming the dignity of the Board to adopt the proposition of Mr. right. They had been humiliated enongh by the right hon. gentleman at the head of the Board of Works. Sir B. Hall was at present on the horns of a dilemma, and he wished to keep him there, because he had been the grand instrument in deferring the main drainage of London to an indefinite period. There could be no doubt that although the Board had been constituted through the instrumentality of that gentleman for the pL.rpose of carrying out the main czainage scheme, yet that the coure he was pursuing had virtually for its object the taking it out of the hands of the Board. It was a course not authorized by Parliamient, not justified by a right and just discrimination, but was one Dictated by an overbearing will, and carried ont by overhearing coiduct, such as every right-minded man must f .ndemn. le was a second Nena Sahib. (Loud laughter.) The question before the Board was somewhat difficult to eeal with. The best course they could pursue was to retrace their steps, and endeavour to do their duty in that vay which Parliament had enjoined upon them, and which ao other body had the privilege to do,-namely, by initiating a plan, for at present they had no plan before them. Upon the whole, thinking it preferable to have the opinion of hree eminent engineers upon all the plans, he should vote n favour of the original motion. Mr. WILKI;IsoN supeorted the amendment. He did not approve the strong Ian ge which had been used in reference to the conduct of the First Commissioner, who, as It appeared to him, had simply done his duty. Mr. DOULION had failed to discover anything to induce him to assent to the course which Mr. Carpmael had suggested. If the reports were referred to three engineers', it was reasonable to expect that they would not make their report before eight or nine months had expired. The labours of Parliament would be then just about drawing to a close; and if they found this great question negleeted the probability was that Parliament would not separate without first separating that Beard. This was a time when they had an opportunity of merging senall matters of difference in effecting a great principle. He acepted the amendment of Mr. Wright because it was the first step for bringing about a doeision which it was most ddesirable to arrive at. He was opposed to the motion of Mr. Carpmael because it would occasion great delay. Colonel KMNINEx Y was anxious to support the amendment for one very distinct reason-namely, that lie believed they had received from their own engineer all the advice that could be obtained upon the subject. Professional opinon was essentially critical; if, therefore, they were to consult three other professional gentlemen, it would only be adding to their present difficulties. From much experience on Boards he -was of opinion that if any number of persons were made referees, the instruction to them should be to examine the subject matter together, but eaeh to make a separate report. He never knew a collective report which conmined the entire opinions of any one of the parties making It. There were givings aud takings by which the whole efficacy of tevery individual opiniou was destroyed. The Board had the ablest man to assist them, and tbey did not require any other assistance. He gave Sir B. Hall great credit for the course he had taken. If he had intended absolutely to reject your plan, what was his object in referring it to three eDgineers ? It was a project of enormous magaitude, and it required to be scrutinized. Every engineer ought to work in conformity with the laws of nature as far as it was possible to go; and he traced in Mr. Bazalgette's plan those principles, but he traced in the suggestions sent back by the ze!erees the greatest hostility to the laws of nature. Mr. WAuRE supported the amendment, and thought it would be perfectly competent for the Board to come to an arrangement with the First Commissioner without any previous reference of the plans to other engineers. He denied l that in so great a work as that with which the Board had to , deal no unneoessary or undue delay had taken place in their proceedings. Mr. D'IFff.GxR rose to correct what he conddered an error. It had been said by one or two gentlemen that the Board had no scheme before thenn. How could that with any accuracy be said when the plan which had I een sent by Sir B. Eall to the Board was tne very plan, with certain modifications, which was prepared by Mr. Bagalzette, their own engineer? He thought it was the euty of the Board to have au interview with Sir Benjamin Hall, to ascertain what modifications he would be willing to agree to in the plan Prepared by the Government engineers, and to consult with him generally as to the best means of carrying out this great work. That would not in any degree compromise the dignity of the Board, the primary duty of which it was to consult the best interests of the publio. After.a few observations by Mr. CARPMAEL in reply, the motion wvas put, when there were on a divison 8 for, and 20 a!gariust it. The amendmnent was then put as an original motion, when there were on a division 18 for, and 9 against it. Mr. Alderrman CutrrT said, the idea of opon sewers was ene tbat never could be tolerated, public feeling would revolt agalnst It, and public opinion would emphatioally pro. nounce against it, and be was satisfied that Parliament wouald never permit it to be doDne. le therefore begged to move,- "That tiz Board considers that the open Sewers propoOed by thb pDlan ot the refer s of tho Fi,st Comr,i*ioner are altogether inudesiatibl, and ia of 'piuion that it would not bh iustiied in arr, .g oat any scheme of wManb suab Ova!) saewar formal a part, but that the other poiuts of diffrenuod appear to be fair tubjects for disounion and asrangemnent." Mir. BRISTOW seconded the motion, which was agreed to unanimously. Air. BiisTrow thea moved ,;'The aprolatment of a ,m=wittoa for the eurpoie of drawing uo a wxitten eomxnuaicetton to be ,nade to the Farest conmmis3ioner, based upon the proew Sing re3l0hitons, pleparatory to a confereuce rwith nim on the subjisceL" The motion having been seconded was strongly opposed by 7ir. EAwizs, Mr. LFASLIF, and Mr. El L. TAYLOR; hut on the question being put tho motion was carried vvithout a division. The following gentlemen wore named as the committee: -_r. Bri5tow, Mr. Wright, MrL Alderman Cnbitt, Mr. Donlton, MIr. Turner, Mr. Oilb,r, MIr. 1ennis, Colonel Kiennedy, rand MAr. D'lff^anger. IThe Board, after sitting live hours, adjonrned.
SOUTH- WEST MIDDLESEX AGRICULTUBAL SOCIETY. The annual exhibition of cattle and poultry establisled by this society, in connexion with their ploaghing matches, took place 3esterday at Acton in the paddocks of Baron Lione de Rothschild, who is one of the chief patrons of the association. The arrangementsmade by the committee, under the immediate superintendence of their active secretary, Mr. Gotelee, were most satisfactory. The poultry were exhibited under extensive marquees, *nd the cattle were comfortably housed in stables and outhouses, which would have afforded them ample protection had the weather proved unpropitious. The precaution, although judicious at this period of the year, fortuzately proved unnecessary, and the ground was thronged during the day by visitors from the neighbouring districts of Middlesex, Surrey, and Buckinghamsbire. The exhibitior. of poultry, although the coops were not numerous, excited considerable interest, and among the stock-which were remarkable for their quality-were some animnals which, according to experienced breeders, could not be surpassed at cattle shows of the highest class. A bull, under three years old, bred by Baron de Rothschild, and which obtained the fliat prize, was greatly admired, as were asso many of the horses exhibited. The interest of the agricultural portion of the visitors was pretty equally divided between the display of live stock and the ploughing matches, in which the 7bighest skdll was displayed. One ploughing match excited intense interest-the competitors representing the respxetive counties of Buckinghamshire, Middlesex, and Surrey. The Middlesex men were the victors, and were in the employ of Mr. Ginger, of Stanwell, and Mr. Sherborn, of Bedfont. A silver cup, exquisitely embosmd, was presented to the society by Baron de Rothschild to be awarded to the person who obtained the greatest number of prizes for stock, and this handsome gift was carried off by Mr. Eley, of Hounsiow, to whom it was presented by Lord Villiers. In the evenirg the members of the society and their friends dined together at the Star and Garter, at Kewbridge, where an excellent dinner was served in a large marquee erect d in the garden of the hoteL Lord Villiers presided, and was supprted by MIr. Byng, XP., Mr. James Montgomery, the Rev. E. W. Relton, vicar of Baling, hlr. H. Day, the Rtev. E& L. de Burgh, Mr. Alderman Rose, end Messrs. N. and L. de Rothschild, sons of Baron Lion, l de Rothschild. The usual loyal toasts having been drunk, The noble CHArmA.N, in proposing "The Army and Navy," said, he believed that toast could never have been drunk with morefeeling than at the present moment,when so many of our troops were engaged in executing, not vengeancP, but justice, upoa barbarians who had shed innocent blood in a manner unexampled in previous ages (cheers), and he was convinced there was no sacrifice which the country would not be prepared to make in order to maintain that struggle. (Reacwed cheers.) He might observe with pride that a relative of his (Captain W. Peel) was, if he might say co, rendering tie two services twin by advancing with a detachment of seamen in support of the army (cheers), and he would venture to say that the honour of the niavy would never suffer in the hands of that gallant officer. (Cheers ) Captain S.XELL, in returning thanks, said, he had seryedin the Iidian armjy, ai d he was satisfied that the disoipline of the native troops had baen materially impaired in consequence of the paucity of Earopean officers, He knew from observation that the majority of infantry regiments in India had not haif their proper complement of European officers, and the consequence was that many native regiments were comn,anded by young men who had but recently arrived in India and who were unacquainted with the feelings and sn; erstitions of the natives. He was glad the English nation had shown their determination not o ignore -if he rnigl.t say so-Christianity by pandering to the native feeling with reference to caste (cheers) ; but it must be remembe ed that the religiousopinions of no nation, whether they were false or not, could be infringed and insulted with impunity. (Elear, hear.) Unfortanately, in too many cases young men, who had gone out to India totally ignc rant of the character of the native mind, had ettran ed 'he natives, when they might have concilated them, Ty t he disregard they had exhibited for their religious feelings. He might venture to say, with reference to the navy, that he confidently anticipated that that branch of the saerni e would render most valuable assistance to the army in India under the leadership of the relative of their noble clairman, Captain Peel. (Loud cheers.) The next toasts were, " the bishop and clergy of the dioces-," to which the Rev. E. RXLTON responded, and " the Lord-Lieutenant and magistrates of the county," which was acknowledged by Mr, MorTGoMfERY. The CHAIRMiAN then gave 'I the health of the members for the county," observing that one of those entlemen, whose namoe was well known in Middlesex, had favoured them with his presence, and declaring his belief that that hon. gentlemen would maintain the honour of his name by folowing the steps of his predecessors who had represented the county. (Cheers.) Mr. By,;G expressed his regret that his co'league, Mr. Hanbury, was not present to discharge the daty he was called upon to perform, observing that, as by a very salutary rule all political discussion was tabooed at the meetings of the society, it was difficult for him to find anthing to say. He must frankly tell them he knew very little about farnaing, and he did not like to talk about subjects with which he was unacquainted. Three or four days ago he mentioned to some friends the invitation he had received to attend that meeting, when they said, *' What ! you go to an agricultural meeting and attend an agricultural dinner Why, you know nothing abonit farming !" (A la-gh.i "That is true," I replied, "but it is no reason why Ishould not learn." (Cheers.) He had, therefore, attended their meeting that day, an. he could assure them he was deeply sensible of his responsibility as ono of their representatives, and that he was most anxious to protmote the welfare of the county-and especially the agricultural portion of it-in all respects. (Cheers.) The CHuAIRMIAN, in proposing " Prosperity to the South- West Middl,sex Agricultural Association," expressed his satisfaction at the success which had been aehieved by the society within the last few years, and at the advantages which it had been the means of effecting with regard to the improvemnent of t,tock, the simplification of agricultural operations, and the elevation of the character of the labourers. The toast wvs drunk with the usual honours, and " The Health of the Chairman" having been proposed by the Rev. Mr. DE BunGH, the noble lord briefly returned than,ks. Mr. MONTGcOMIERY gave " The healths of the Vice-Presidents of the Society," and in doing so took occasion to refer to.the deep interest felt by Baron De Rothschild in the soc ety. and to eulogize the charitable conduct of the baron and baronesss towards the poor of all sects in the parish of Baling and its vicinitvy Mr. N. ROTHSCHILD returned thanks on behalf of his father, who he could assure the meeting would have had great pleasure in joining thens, had it been Possible for him to do so, and in witnessing the progress of an association whose success he was most anxious to promote. Several toasts vwere subsequently drunk, including the health of the committee and the various officora of the society.

WINES FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In one of your leadiug articles of yesterday yon say that it is asserted tbat the Cape of Good Hope Is capable of producing excellent wine. 'We are in a condition not only to substantiate that assertion, but have, during the past few months that we have made use of yonr columns, convinced an unprecedented number of good judges that the wines of the Cape of Good Hope are equal in quality to most of the produce of the Contiuent, and decidedly superior to the second qnalities of Portugal and Spain. While the suacess of introducing these wines has exci eded expectations, our colonists at the Cape have publicly expressed their aLpreciatSon of their cause being advocated in your journal, which has assisted in increasing the valuo of their wines in this market nearly double, and enabled them to ship this ear four times a larger quantity than usual. We are. Sir. vour most obedient szrvAnbs W. & A. G. Uct. 13.
PoruArIToN OF CA-APA.-The population of Canada may be fairly reckoned at 2,500,000. In 1848 the population of the ulited provioces was but 1,500,000. The rate of increase in le.s than 10 years is most encouraging two-thirds added to the population of a contry with such variety of soil anl climate, s that time, is we believe without precedent. The increase of the United States during the 10 years ending 1850 was 35.j per cent. ; that of Upper Canada during the 10 years fromu 1841 to 1851, 101 9 per cent. ; and no N for the whole province sinoe 184i it is 65 to 70 per cent., or nearly double the rate of increase of the United States. The third of a century is generally reckoned as a generation. During that period the population of Canada has increased from 5S2,000 to 2,50,050, or more than twice donbled itself. At tbis rate the population of Canada doubles itself in rather less than 15 Years, and if the ratio of increase he continned Canada will have at the beginning of the next century, 20,000,000 inhabit;nts.- Canadian Nows.
