ArONEY-MARq?T-Glao= illoTILITGANOB. :Thursday Evsx4ng. Ihe Indian newns this morning, although of a phyful character from its contirmation of the inassacre of Sir Hugh Wheeler and his small band, together with the 200 women and children they Â¶vere protecting in the fort at Cawnpore, produced -no unfavoucable effect upon the funds, the first tranactions in Consols being at the closing priees of aresterday. For a short time there was a tendency to improvement, but ultimately the speculators were disposed to press sales, and a reaction oc. curred of a quarter per cent. Consols for money opened at 90( to J, whence, owing to purchases on the part of the public, they went to 9* to i. There was then a decline to 90i to which was the last official quotation. For the h of September they left off at 90i to J. Bank Stock closed at 214k to 215 ; Reduced, 91; New 'rhree per Cents., 91i; India Stock, 210 to 213; India Bonds, 20s. to 6as. discount; and Exchequerpills, 4s. discount to par. 'The rate for loans on Government securities in the Stock- Exchange remains at 4- per cent. In the ciscount-market the demand was active, and the wplicationa at the Bank have increased. In the foreign stock-market there has been more tivity, at generally formner prices. A smaU advance occurred in Turkish. Brazilian Five per Ce1ts. 'were negotiated at 102; ditto, 1829 and i839, 101; Mexican, 22-; Peruvian Four-and-a-alf per Cents., for the account, 82; Russian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., Small, 99i; Spanish, for Cie account, 4;0; ditto, New Deferred, 25X; ditto Passive, 5j; and the Certificates, 6k, 0, and 6 ; surkish Six per Cents., 94 and i ; ditto for the account, 94k and 95 ; the Four per Cents. GuaranOewd, 99g and J; Venezuela One-and-a-Half per (Cents, 12k; and Belgian Four-and-a-Ealf per Cents., 99. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. for money and 66f. 95c. f.r the account, showing a fractional improvement. A further total of 37,0001 Australian gold was told to the Bank to-day, making an aggregate of *about 360,0001. out of the 510,0001. brought by the Creat Britain. The European mail steamer has brought 50,9771. from Australia, but this will not be received till miext week. The Indian despatchee on the present occasion fail to give any quotation of the price of Governmnent paper, although it would furnish the best -aeans of judging; of the state of feeling of the general population. It appears that a China mail has been received in due course along with those from Bombay and Calcutta, and that the break in the service necesoitated by the loss of the Erin will oocur during the niext fortnight. Al the present mails may be ex*1ected in London on Saturday. The Indian and China exchanges to-day showr no anaterial variation, but such movement as is perceptible is rather in an adverse direction, A favourable decline of about J per cent. has occurred at Bombay, but at Calcutta there has been an advance to that extent. At Shanghai and Rongkong there has also been a fractional advance. As the telegraph, however, reports some extremely heavy transactioins in silk at Shanghai it is satisfactory that the rate has experienced so little alteration. The quantity of bales arrived was 150,000, and the settlements 13,000. Prices were very high. Tea also had been well maintained, but there had been few transactions. Lord Elgin was about to proceed to the Peiho to communicate his arrival toothe Enperor. About 80,0001. in half-imperiala is on its way -rom Russia. This, however, has been under a epecial arrangement, and not from any removal of te general restrictions against the exportation of gold. The rumour at St. Petersburg is that the tGovernment have permitted an eminent firm there to remit this amount to England to counteract the recent heavy fall in the exchange, but for ordinary applicants the difficulty of procuring gold is such that it commands a premium of about 2 per cent. The exchange, which had receded to 37d., has now -ecovered to 37id. The long-expected ukase for reducing the rate of interest on deposits at the banks in St. Petersburg to 3 per cent. had made its appearance, and is to come into operation on the 13th of October, 13th of November, and 13th of January, for the Commercial, Lombard, and Loan Banks respectively. The Australian mails are stil irregular, owing to the colonial agent continuing to despatch them out -of their appointed time, instead of allowing a clear -month to pass to make up for the break originally caused by the loss of the Oneida. The European announced to-dayas having left on the 20th of June ahould have been detained till the 11th of July, and thenceforward the monthly service might have been performed in due course. In consequence of inetructions which will have reached the agent from London it is now assumed that there wiMl be no defarture from the colony in August, that the next steamer will leave on the 11th of September, and -that from that time the departures will be on the 11th of each month, according to the terms of the -contract. In the Australian intelligence to-day it is mentioned that '5 Wetton's offer for the establishment -of a line of steamers between Sydney and Panama has been accepted by the Government of New ,South Wales." Mr. Wetton is understood to be ,the agent of the Royal Mail Steam Company. The sum required from the colonies was 60,0001. per -annum, of which New Zealand had already pledged hmerself to pay one-fourth. By this line Sydney wilL 4njoy the advantage of being the first Australian port of arrival and the last of departure. At a meeting of the Victoria Dock Company to-day, Mr. Charles Morrison in the chair, the report vas unanimously adopted. The chairman stated that by their new Agt the company are empowered to grant leases, raise additional capital to the extent -of 400 0001., let their undertaking for a-period not exceeding sixty years, and to sell the Steelyard estate. By granting building leases, their land wi-D be gradually and permanently improved without risk, or the necessity of using the powers to raise snoney. Two hundred feet of water frontage have already beentakenby theThames GravingDock Comnpany at a rent of 5001. By a condition of the lease to Ieasra. Peto, Betts, and Brassey, security to the amount of 150,0001. is to be furnihed by that firm, and 110,0001. in shares and title deeds has been deposited; for the remaining 40,0001. negotiations are still in progress. In case of a depre-clation in value of these securities Messrs. Peto and Co. may be called upon for an equivalent. The chairman further congratulated the proprietors upon the successful character of their business, and pointed out that at a time when the other dock -companies showed a falling off the tonnage entered In the Victoria Docks increased six per cent., and the number of ships eight per cent., upon the coraresponding period of last year. In conclusion he .appealed to the shareholders to make a provision for alleviating the educational destitution of the disrict in which their property is situated. A sum of 1,152:. has already been subscribed for this purpose by the Boara and officers of the company and a few -of the proprietors. The following deserves attention, as an mustration of the correctness of the remarks recently made with regard to the tone usally adopted by a por-tion of the Liverpool community in the case of peculative failures:- "ffir,-Tho remarks in your City Artcle of this day, zeflecting so severely on the moraut of our Liverpool businaes ommaunit, call for some notice; and I hope, in fair.neo you will not refuse admison to a few w-ords i a,iolder. " Unhappily, of late days eacePadce among the mercantile ajeople have been of too common occurrnce; so much so, *hat we mow seldom hear the high and unimpeachable integriy of the British merchant proclaimed ix the boastfal tona of other times 1' Unhappily, also, withln the clty of London, during the feu' peat monus, we bave beheld the appalling spectacle of aumaroUs member of yoar own oommercl body,-many dfitingpIed for ther soial virtue, tbelirpoltlcal spirit, and religious anctity, saddenly umask rnd draged from their high pogitions to be oAgt into the felon'e cel-nd all theme notorioms crmiran were congregated ithi 4a crcular mile of Printing-house-square.

"' A LIV3EPOOL BROKER, "Lverpol, Aug. 24." Li the morality of this witer to be acepted a4 the Liverpool codd T ,jnstead of beiug, thankful for each dpnunciation ambling delrquencies, come from what quarter . may, he complains of L,n.. doners uttering a word re'_nrding anything that may happen iu Liverpool, becausG Londbn itself cannot boast of purity. His doctrine is, not that every well-wisher to the legitimate trader should help to expose and condemn " the .escapoe4d of mercantile people" whenever or wherever they may happen, but that no one having any regard for decency should aay a word upoa the subject until it can be proved that he residesin some partof the unitedkingdom where such events never happen. A more plausible mode of insuring immunity for wrongdoers was never devised, and the Liverpool people may at all events be proud of the ingenuity of their spokesmnan. The remaining clauses of his letter, how ever, scarcely harmonize wi th the acuteness of its commencement, since, with a simplicity that seems to denote an origin from the opposite side of the Irish Channel, he retorts upon the Londoners, who charge the Liverpool people with sympathy for speculative insolvents, by pointing to the penal fate lately inflicted by the Londoners on Sir John Paul, Redpath, Robson, Saward, and others. His concluding sentence is also unwise, as it admits of a plain question being asked in reply. The remndrks of The Times on Liverpool affairs are, he says, generally ridiculous exaggerations. WiU he mention an instance, or is the assertion of " A Liverpool Broker" to be held to settle the question? During the last ten years the only Liverpool cases prominently referred to by The Tiimes have been those of Mr. Oliver, Mr. '.Henry, and Ar, Doherty, and the tampering with the barometer on the :xchange in order to produce a rise in corn. Does the " Liverpool Broker" refer to any of these? It is true that in the case of iMr. Oliver some of the leading merchants of Liverpool affixed a declaratioa on 'Change to the effect that The Times' announcement w.ith regard to that gentleman was a ridiculous exaggeration, but, asit subsequently turned out that the failure was one of the most ruinous on record, and that even the testimonial of plate gratefully offered to Mr. Oliver by his admiring townspeople had long been pawned to assist in carryin on his operations, it cannot be supposed that this is intended to be referred to. Neither can it be the case of Mr. MlI'Henry, although at that period one of the Liverpool papers intimated that The Times' announcenient of the disaster was merely another instance of the antagonism of London to LiverpooL With regard to Mr. Doherty nothing need be said, since theLiverpool papers of this day report the commencement of an inquiry into the proceedings of that gentleman before the town magistrates. There merely remains the charge regarding the barometer. Here, as in the case of Mr. Oliver, the statements of The Times were vehemently contradicted, but an inquiry subsequently took place and resulted in its being considered necessary to put a padlock on the instrument,which in that protected state became for some time an object of local curiosity. Consequently, it is not this to which the " Liverpool B3roker"' refers. As he writes in the interests of usticehe will, however, doubtless lose no time in endeavour ing to corroborate his assertion. Meanwhile he must be informed that, as The Times never makes any commercial statements with regard to Liverpool, except such as may proceed from its most influential residents, he will prove too much as far as bis own argument is concerned if he can show that these even are not to be relied upon. It will also be well for him to remember that there has never been any pretence that London is more exemnpt than Liverpool from commereial delinquencies. The only regret is that when such events occur there Is always in Liverpool a certain party ready to meet them by a Biat deniaL. It r head-quartr maey easily be conjectured. " If," wmtes one of the most honourable and intelligent men among the Liverpool merchants, in a communication received yesterday, " you could sweep the lIAverpool Stock Exchange from the face of the earth you would indeed be a public benefactor. All the evis which have thrown such diseredit upon the place have their origin there." This, of course, is a figure of speeeb, the regular stock transactionB of the place being conducted with as much good faith as those of the metropolis ; but it suggests a quarter where a small minority may be tound capable ot working a very considerable amount of mischief.

LOND OR, AtDAY, A UGUSr 28,1B57. By a strange inconsistency, of the two de"tohes that arrived on Wednesday night from Ttiate, the one addresaed to the Foreign-office did not oonltin whAt appear with ocu sad proraneur i" that ' I I i ) 'cI sent by our own agent-the surrender, and aubsequen Z ?of the uarr;i3 91stppre, - S, (e fie' :o VIM - 21s EvropoW lu15FUiVM uhiefly women- a-d fidreftig oa the Okpges t&'Ohe parado-ground, of Capore, and -there murdered- the - l*Ae ia %ne helpleussriaas, hMhad aecdppora o itu of -the same kind, and bi`made4the samoue ' of it. At ithe date of e firgt 4ftir it *w - thi at he had a very large force, the nucke being - body of armed mel, with atillery, which we English at home hear with-astonishment he had been permitted to keep about bim a long time, though known to be a bitter enemy of the British rule, and with what he considered a strong private grievance. It is hardly posible to canvass what is indeed wholly inscratable. The only w er is that such things are common in India, and India is not like England. Thank EHnA&vm, England is not like India, and we remember with gratitude the parting remark of JEIXmy VII. to a nobleman whose hospitality he had been enjoying, and who, in defiance of a recent Act, escorted him with a body of armed retaine-m out of his demeane: "My Attorney-General will speak to you of this ;" -as indeed he did with a vengeance. Besides hisown ordinary bodyguard, this man, who has alwaya had the worst reputation, soon gathered al sorts of irregulars, and it is to be presumed a good portion of the mutineers from Cawnpore itself. These were the 1st, 53d, and 56th Native Infantry, the 2d Light Cavalry, and two companies of Artillery. It is not very clear what force Sir HUGH WEEanB had with him, as the accounts do not agree, and are evidently conjectural. According to the Bonmbay Times, part of Hz- MIsTXSsY's 10th Regiment and a battery of European Artillery were on the spot at the time of the original outbreak, and a repetition of the tragedies at Bareilly and Shahjehanpore thereby prevented. There was, however, several days! fighting, and, though the mutineers were driven out of the place, many on our side are said to have fallen. Our own Bombay correspondent, writing on the 28th of June, says, "Cawnpore, we believe,hasbeen saved by the arrival "of the 84th and of the 64th, the latter from "Bombay ;" but, though their destination might be Cawnpore, they do not appear to have reached it in time to prevent the catastrophe. They have had a share in avenging it, as far as that has been done. The precise order of events at that place we shall probably know on Saturday, but the general outline given in the despatch is most lamentable. The garrison, being reduced to famine, capitulated to NnwA SAHiB, on the solemn assurance that their lives should be spared, and were immediately massacred. This is such a stereotyped form of words that one is almost ashamed towrite them. The same thing has occurred a thousandtimes before inlndian history, and, under given circumstances, will always be repeated. We cannot help wishing it may turn out that Sir HuGH WianLER had been kil'led before the capitulation, and that he, finished his long and bril- liant career still as a soldier, and not a3 the helpless victim of a hideous butchery. Hi history is remarkable. He was a soldier of the LAxI days. He entered the army in 1803, joined his regiment at this very station of Cawnpore, and marched thence under Lord Lax, now 54 years ago, to the conquest of Delhi. He had distinguished himself sine in -Alfghanistau and elsewhere, and his long term of service comprised almost half the period of our rule in India. We will own to a melancholy satisfaction in the thought that, by the breach of this capitulation, we are now at liberty to deal with Nxn& S rs according to all the laws of peace and of war. We should, indd, be sorry to be under any obligation or in any sort of covenant with the deliberate murderer of more than a hundred women and children. It is difficult indeed to imagine how Sir H. Wnim B or the surviving officer in commind, could either trust such a man or wish to enter into terms with him. On this point we hope to be better informed than we are. But, however that maybe, NENA SAnTB hasreleased us from all obligation; and if he, or one of his gang, escape the halter, it must only be because the bullet or the bayonet has been beforehand with it. We trust that England will spare no cost of men or of money to vindicate justice and humanity upon the person of this savage and his myrmidons. Extraordinary crimes require extraordinary penalties; and, if wemeanto sustainthe British rule or human nature itself, in any wholesome sense of that term, in Hindostan we must make a signal example of the men who have offered these affronts upon it. We occasionally hear whispers about cheap sentiments of mercy and pity for these men. Whatever we may desire for their souls, it is a plain matter of business what ws have to do with their bodies, and not only India, but the world, will be intolerable if we neglect our duty to them. Nothing else will tell on the Mahomedan or the Hindoo. For our religion, for our teaching aud preaching, they have an utter contempt. Fortunately they understand what it is to be hung, and have a particular objection to it. Indeed, we have heard lately some earnest remonstrances against the application of this proess to persons so keenly sensitive of its disgrace. That renders it peculiarly adapted for the purpose. What we have to teach the followers of lAHoaaMT and the worshippers of VLS%Nu is that, whatever their creed or their caste, we treat murderers as we do dogs, and in all moral respects rate them a great deal lower. We cannot help calling attention to the remarkable difference between the two telegraphic despatches that appeared one under the other in our yesterday's columns. The first was a gift from Government, and therefore it may be said we ought not to criticize it too sharply. Government, however, will only be too thankful for any suggestions that will enable its servants to do their work better. The second despatch, which only arrived at this office at 5 a.m. yesterday, when our paper was already at press, is an example of good work, and of adaptation to its purposes, telling its story shortly md distinctly. Instead of stating generally that Delhi still " held out," it particalarizes, with very few more words, that the enemy had made three more sorties, in all of which they .were totlly defeated, and suffered heavy losw. It then states expresly the sad fate of the gsrrison at Cawnpore, which the Government despatch - supposed to be known, and there. fore left uncertain. It contains the very en a coraging fact of the 31st Regiment at Saugor, under their native officers alone, driving th, revolted 42d out of the station. Another oision iS important, 'though the fact was perhaps supposd to b eknown,- not a word is said in either deapatch as to the fate of the Transit, and the incomprehsnsible voyage of the soldierx and crew back to Suez. To-norrow, however, will solve this enigma. -
Among the odditiea of our constitutional wystem not the lesst remarkable is the hereditary luck of a few wizttocratic faniliei. A great many Poers are welrthy and respectable, and the whole body have abundaUt reason to -be atisfied with their 'posticb, advantages, and prospecta; but a small cluster of names more wuliarly attract the $miles of Fortlme as represented by succesive niUtries.

GosvXNor, WILTON, g EiTOs. -the head of, he; house derives his -titlef-Marquis-from-Weetninster, and MijgU %dipAUted 'groV d-landlord over the fashionable regions of Belgravia. ILord IRoBasT GRosvxwog a for35 year enjoyed a peaceable tenure of his seat.for the metropolitan county, disturbed but by ! on1e passing disension with his beer-selling and beer-drinking constituents. In return for his services, and as a tribute to the greatness of the GRosvENozs, he now takes his Eeat beside his two brothers in the House of Lords. Their ancestors may look down on them and see, as was said of the mother of the WEr;LXSrYS, ' Omnes oBsicolas, omnes sQpep alta tenenteL." The BYNG family is for the present contented with two-peerages, but its interests are even dearer to those who make it their business to confine the I distribution of honours within their accustomed! channel. It in evidently consistent with the fitness of things that the name should once more be con-| nected with Middlesex. The county is supposed 1 stiU to owe a debt of gratitude to the old Whig gentleman who had risen in its service to the venerable post of Father of the House. On the extinction of the available GnosvENORs nothing can be more natural than the suggestion of reverting to the BYNGs; and it is satisfactory to find that the sittingc member for Tavistook is on this occasion disposed to assume a more conspicuous position. The patrons of the few rotten boroughs which were spared in 1832 have carefully deprived themselves of the only pretext on which their privileges could be defended against the encroachments of a new Refonn Bill. The nomination seats might have been used to provide for statesmen who were temporarily unpopular, or to bring forward unconnected young men who might become future PrrTs and CAwNiGS. Englishmen are always ready to tolerate an anomaly which in practice is found to work well; but close boroughs represented by insigniificant connexions of the patrons are equally odious to theorists and to working politicians. It i3 not worth while to expose the constitution to unfriendly criticism, that an idle young Guardsman may have a seat in the House of Commons, or even that the promising scion of a Liberal family may save himself the trouble of contesting a popular constituency. Few will grudge Lord PALMMSTON the peaceful occupation of Tiverton; but, if Mr. G. BEG possesses the qualities attributed to him by his friends, he has assuredly no business in the cognate borough of Tavistock. Extreme prudence is not a popular virtue in youth. A rising patriot might have found an opportunity during the general election of making himself something of an independent position by appealing to an important body of electors. Mr. BYNa preferred the favour of a Dulke to the applause of a multitude, and he may think himself lucky in the occurrence of the accident which enables him so soon to retrieve his mistake. It would perhaps be too much to expect that the vacancy at Tavistock should be filled by some member of political eminence or promise. The electors of Middlesex will probably be disPosed to giva the namesake of their old member a fair trial. By connexion and early training Mr. Bvr-G is pledged to al hberal policy, and his constituents will know that if he wishes to express their views he Wll secure the great advantage of a favourable hearing. The stil powerful section of his party to which he immediately belongs have founded on one or two creditable speeches in the House of Cominons anticipations which have at least not yet proved to be delusive. The early pre-eminence of Fox, and possibly the rival precocity of Prr, have always encouraged a traditional expotation of -. youthfull ehampion -who should revive the ancient glory of the Whigs. Mr. BENG has been thought more capable than any contemporary in a similar position of becoming in course of time a Parliamentary leader, and the rarity of his efforts in the House may fairly be explained by a not unbecoming diffidence. If he succeeds in obtaining the present object of his ambition, he will be both entitled and expected to give more unmintakeable proofs of his capacity. There are many members competent to deliver fluent and rational speeches who have little prospect of guiding parties or Cabinets. If the new candidate be.returned for Middlesex, he will do well to recollect that he owes to his party and to his constituents a debt of which no instalment is yet discharged. Even the easy defeat of Lord Cn3r.SxA at the General Election was achieved by an untried competitor. Mr. BvmNes public services have to be performed, and his reputation, though it may possibly be hereafter confirmed, is as yet wholly confined to clubs and to coteries. The opinion of a friendly circle is at best a preliminary introduction to public confidence. Many potential orators and statesmen have passed away in lifelong obscurity; but the applauded heir of a Whig family, especially if he represents an important constituency, can only allege one reason for failure. The belief that his position had been attained through his own merits would be of itself a sufficient proof that the hopes of his party were unfounded. The strongest minds are most exempt from the propensity to appropriate as merits the results of fortune. The influence of family connexion on the choice of members of Parliament is by no means without its advantages. It is impossible that young men should be recommended by their wvn qualities to numerous sections of the community. Those who have earned a local reputation by their energy and abilities enter the House of Commons in middle life, with their habits a]ready formed, and their interest probably concentrated on questions apart from general politics. Many a local magnate finds himself as little suited to the House as a meritorious soldier on his promotion to the mess of a fashionable regiment. It has been a subject of general remark that the large towns exercise by their representatives an altogether inadequate influence in Parliament. Mr. BRIGoT and Mr. COBDKn stand prominently apart from the class to which they belong, and both would have been better qualified for high office or for party leadership if they had entored the House of Con- I mons while their reputations had yet to be made. The counties and small boroughs are guided in their selec'ion of candidates by many accidental! and illogical reasons; but when they return un- tried politicians on account of family connexion I ihey sometimes light on the raw material of a future statesman. It is natural that the aristo-i (ratio composition of C{abinets should be regarded with jealousy, but it is geneally found that indi- vidual Ministers ha-e previously earned their i position by distinction in Parliament. The class to which they belong is certainly not superior .n ability to any other highly educated portion of the community, but they have dtarted at the point which their competitors spend half their lives in attaining. The additional advantage thus secured to the favourites of fortune Les been unavoidably increased by the operation of the Rleform BilL Almost all institutions involie some admixture of good, and even rotten boroughs occasionallytended to mitigate the aristo. cratic monopoly of office and of power. No Reformer in his senses would, however, propors either to revive the ancient abuses or to maintain the nomination boroughs which still exist. The great constituecieO h4ve thA renmedy in their owv, hands. Their Parliamentary influence will always be exactly proportionate to the statesmanlike qualifications which they require in their members.
We extracted at length in our imapressioi of Wednesday last a communication made in the form of a regular despatCh to the Nord of Brui sels from its " own correspondent" at MSdra. The opinions expressed by such a functionary and circulated in such a journal respecting the position and prospects of the British in India assume a greater interest just now than might perhaps intrinsically pertain to them, and we are bound to say that, upon the whole, the description and conclusions given in the report are lesa perverted and more impartial than might have been anticipated. India, it is true, is ?Ot "a theatre of the most "horrible crimes and atrocities from Cape Co"morin to the foot of the Himalayas," for over the larger portion of this territory the authority of the British Government has either remained unassailed or been successfully asserted; but, though the case is so far exaggerated, the proceedings of the insurgents are justly characterized, and not extravagantly considered. In announcing the result of his observations, the writer puts aside altogether the defects attributed to the organization of the Bengal Army, and ascribes the outbreak to causes which, with one exception-the licentiousness of the native press-he derives from the systematic policy of the Indian Government. He alleges, as a principal explanation of the rebellion, that we have treated native Princes with injustice by annexing their territories to our own, and discarding the claims of their widows and representatives, and that we have grasped with too unscrupulous an ardour at the hoards which these petty chieftai occasionally accumulate. This, in point of fact, forms the substance of his accusation ; for, though he charges the authorities with bad faith towards the Sepoys in two, and only two, instances, he evidently relies upon our acquisitive propensities as furnishing the gravamina required. We may be excused, under the circumstances for alluding, in the first place, to the charges which this indictment does nwt contain. We are not accused of mal-administration, of oppressing the people by taxation, of being indifferent to their wants, or disregarding their welfare. Not a syllable is said in disparagement of the general relations maintained between the Indian Government and its subjects, while it is freely admitted that the native press abused its privileges by traducing and reviling the authorities of the country. Although our rule is that of conquerors, we are not charged with any tyrannical use of our power, excepting on the points referred to, nor is it in any way intimated that the hundred millions of Hindoos subject to the sceptre of Britain have any reason to be discontented with the dominion under which they live. These omissions in the mouth of a censor convey, we think, no faint praise, and may serve to convince the world that the onslaught we are now resisting, though it may have been facilitated by errors of policy, has not been provoked by misrule. On the subject of our alleged encroachments, we venture to say that the territorial distribution of India still actually existing is sufficient to rebut the charge, at the same time that the known circutnstances of the revolt imperatively forbid us to attribute its outbreak in any degree to causes deduced from such assumptions. For a whole century we have now been the strongest Power in a country where might has for ages been esteemed 1 equivalent to right, and where the tenure of all dominion was so precarious that 50 years! posesdon was thought to constitute a notable inheritance. For a long time past we have been absolutely supreme-so supreme that our will was law, while our aolmorlowegod pooition an Sovereigns pammmount entitled us to the rights of supremacy and reversion over all the territories of India. Yet, with these chances in our favour, and with the stimulus incessantly arising from the spectacle of misgoverned provinces, and the convictions of mistaken policy, we have not only tolerated but have even protected against the retributive wrath of their own subjects scores of Princes whose titles to dominion were founded in many instauces either on recent usurpation or violent conquest. Until the escheat of Nagpore, a short time since, the whole centre of the Peninsula was absorbed by the Mahratta States and the dominions of the NrzAN. The spacious districts of Rajpootana are still studded with EHindoo Principalities, and many a Eajah of whose very name Englishmen are ignorant lives under the aegis of British supremacy in a pomp and affluence which might rank with those of European Sovereignties. If at last we terminated misrule in Oude by the deposition of a Prince whose ancestor we ourselves had crowned, we make bold to say that under no Government but ours would a State so situated and so characterized have been tolerated so long. An Oriental Envoy once, on observing the riches of gold and jewelry displayed in the shops of the metropolis, remarked to his attendant that our QUEEN could have Tery little power, implying that under a Government of his own conception such tempting treasures would have been promptly appropriated by the Monarch on the throne. To Asiatic eyes our rule in India must offer analogous examples of forbearance, and the very catalogue of Rajahs and millionaires for whose hoards we are said to be gaping ought to speak for the justice of that Government under which, for the first time in Indian history, such acquisitions have been permanently secure. In refutation of the statement that the ranklings of injustice in the breasts of deposed families have created the insurrection now raging, we need only point to the notorious fact that the great landholders and chieftains, as a body, have stood aloof from the rebellion. That Asiatics, whose very life is intrigue, and who revel with all the sensations of luxury in the turbid waters of a revolution, should abstain in every instance from participation in the troubles now pending was never to be imagined; but the instances of defection have been so few, and the examples of fidelity-on whatever motives grounded--so numerous, as to prove beyond the possibility of doubt that the revolt neither originated with this class of men nor meets with their support. Here andthere, where the succes of a mutinous soldiery have destroyed for a moment the authorit of the Government, a natire chieftain may avail Limself of the opportunity which others have created for him; but that these Princes, where they have risen at all, have followed the revolt, and not led it, is as plain a fact as evidence can constitute. Little, indeed, would a wealthy Rajah gain by the proclamation of a Mahomedan Emperor under the auspices of a ravenous army! When we turn to the remedial measures which the correspondent of the Nerd conceives to be required for the settlement of India under that restoration of our supremacy which he plainly regards as incontestable, we discern still more distinctly how little can really be alleged against us. We are not told to reform our Administration, to remodel our Government, or reconsider our syatem of taxation as affecting the natives at large. We are not even advised to observe greater moderation in dealing with the Princes of the country. We are simply told to maintain a xomeL what larger European foree, to develope railways and other means of internal communication, aud to organize, both provinaiy alnd municipally, a good body of poliee. . It is aiot izlpro)able that the measurea atuauly adopted may coinoide with the recommeudatons here given, but to reer to them as indicating the policy required for the futura tranquility ofIhdia, is ,uivalent to an admision that there A o grvet, persor* ofd , gWe hve klept too iMnj iof ' ' in India, bey6nd a doubt; we have not pused on railway euterpdse'wit 'iifficient4i* and the pot;c of Hindosta. mighi'be auniL t tk great advantlge o the, police of t oja;,9 ,3 if these are the only points on which^ ar4 .ntury's posesion of Asiatic empire',;e lled upon to amend our ways, we do -ut-tlibk Ahat either England or her Indian admini3]iav muchto beaiamed of. ;

SECOND EDITION. IM OC._ F . . . ... . IXPRBSS VROM PAlIS; The following is the letter of our Pais oorrespondont, dated yesterday (Thurzday), 6 p.m. :_ The tral of Cajtai Doineau for. the murder of. the Aga Ben Abdallah draws towards a closel and the interest of the proceedings is maintained to the lat. The 3?rench papers are full of the details, and letters from Oran telL of the excitement that there prevails. A great number of officers from the gar.-L sons of the interior of the country have arrived at Oran, ns well as many visitors from Algiers, which is &00 kilometres distant. On the 19th, the day on -which the pleadings began, an English corvette, says a correspondent in theDroit,cast anchor offthetown, and several Englishmen, including a con of Admit&l Dundas, landed, in order to witness at least one day's proceedings. Astrikingfeature ofthetrialis thcaelfcontradictions and downright peijurie3 of eeme of the vitnesess. If Doineau be acquitted he will doubtless owe it in part to the difficulty of knowing whom to believe. "In your first declarations," said the Advocate-General to a witness, "you lied, and you said it was from fear of the Aga Bel Hadj. Tell all the truth to-day." From fear there is unquestionably an immense amount of lying. Eighteen of the most importaut witnesses avowedly shared in the crime, but seek to extenuate their guilt by throwing the responsibility on Doineau. Strange contradictions arise in the testimony of persons who can hardly be supposed to have an interest ia concealing the truth. They can only be explained, and that but partially, by the confusion and alarm that prevailod after the murder. Thua, on the ensuiug moring, Madame Ximenes, the Spanish lady who travelled by the diligence that conveyed the ill-fated Aga, declared that one of the assailants had called out in French, bidding the European passengers to bave no fear. Mlore than one witussa deposes to her having said this, but on the trial she denies it, and swears " by the heads of her children"' that she heard none but Arab voices. Some of the French witnesses evidently allow themselves to be carried away by pamsion, and, probably, by a desire to shelter a brother officer, whose crime the habits of Africau Eervice scarcely allow them to look upon as disgraceful, or even as of great gravity. Bel Rheir is a Caid, an Arab officer in the French service, a man of great energy and resolution. He is one of the most dangerous witnesses against Doineau, for, unlIke the feeble and vacillating Aga Bel Hadj, he bas never varied in his testimony. When Major Chanzy gives his evidence, he speaks of this Arab with contumely, as having been. an audacious frontier robber. The Counb calls him to order. "I am no cutpurse I" cries Bel Kleir, wihen the' Major's words are interpretedto him, "but a warrior covered with wounds. I have the esteem of men, and have done my duty to France." Investigations are ordered. On a subsequent day documents and registers are produced, and Major Chauzy's accmations fall to the ground. This same officer is questioned with respect to the pistols -which Doineau said General Montauban desired him to convey to the Captain in his prison. There are discrepancies between the different newspaper reports of his reply. One of them minkes him depose that Montaubau had sald to him "The Captain Is greatly compromised, and, sinceyou are his friend, I should not hesitate, in your place, to send a pair of pistols to bim in ,his prison." Nothing, however, proves that General Montauban had any personal motive for wishing Doineau to commit suicide, biit that he desired to save the honour of the epaulet from the contact of the bangman.. As regerds the maoney made [by the camels,'nuspicion points at Doinean as the receiver of a part of it; and the suspicion is confirmed by his obstiuate refusal to account for the possesson of 38,OW., part of which he had given to a servant to conceal for him. The story of these 104 camels is sketched in rather different colours by General Beaufort and by the Arab traders and shepherds. The Morocco tribe of the Mhayas had brought wool into the French territory (contraband, says General Beaufort); returning home with their unloaded beasts they were met by some Spabis. They took to flight, and their beasts were seized. These were sold to Bel Hadj much below their value, rezold at a large profit, and Dolueau is suspected of having shared the gain. The seizure appears to have been scarcely just; Ben Abdallsh had promised to obtain restitution; he was unable to do thls,and thought Doineau to blame. Hence bad blood between them ; such, at least, is what we gather from Arab iestimony, but there is much conflicting evidence. What is rendered prettyevident bythis trialis thatchiefs of Arab bureaux,as Doineau was, have almost unlimited power in heir hands. and that the system hitherto adopted presses most severely on the nation. Doiueau, a mau of great energy and violent character, made the Arabs tremble before him. "He was our Sultan," said the witnesses, even the eadis and agas, " who could resist him ?" He was, as one of the adverse couusel said, a little satrap, ruling 30,030men,and disposing at his will of their fortunes and even of their liveP. As regarded the summary executions, mentioned in a former letter, General Beaufort took the responsibility of several, but it remained evident that others had taken place by Doineau's sole authority. "If bushes could speak," (si les roussailles pmuaient parler,), said one of the witnesses, "they would tall the fate of many an unforbunate captive. We cannot wonder to see Doinean's superiors and comrades making every effort to save him. If he had been guilty of extortions and bad held life cheap, others had done the same. Exaggerating the severity necessry to maintain order in his district, he had learned to think little of taking the life of an Arab, until at last he is found accused of playing the part of a highway murderer. His demeanour throughout the trial has betrayed his imperious and passionate nature. Great indulgence has been shown to him in this respect by the tribunal, and it was needed. The Arab witnesses, with scarcely an exception, gave evidence in their own tongue; the interpreter was at times careless or incompetent, and some of his omisions elicited bursts of anger from the Captain, who, having served in Africa almost from boyhood, is a perfect master of the Arabic. Judging from the words and deportment of the French military witnesses, from the generals downwards, it would, doubtles, have been greatly to the advantage of Doineau to be -trled by a court-martial The civil tribunal before which he is arraigned did not conceal its painful sstonishment at some of the practices proved to be usual among military authorities. The loose system of accounts in the Arab bure4ux evidently afforded great facilities for peculation. This system, however, it was stated in the course of the tial, had been recognized as bad, and had just undergone a clhange. The exactions of the Arab officials, the khalifs and agas, are said to be very large, and the people, of course, su#ier to enrich these native dignitaries. A letter from Oran tells of a khalifat worth 4,000L. a year. The halif of Mostaganem is said to have amassed a fortune of 8,000o. a-year. The consequence of this is that there are tÂ±ibeX in Algeria not safe to venture among, except with good escort. Ben Abdallah was the ags of the Boni-8nQus, They has twice tried to assazto him He had seen his attendants slot down by hl,i aide, and had himself received a bullet in his breAst. ]But hg died the owner of mFan,yhoAuses at Tlemcen, 4 tOf nuger uk%Ilo&s and heedis Althoughhis wife brings her -action for damages against-his murderers, aecordiig to the French mode (sIprte partwv:civile), it is for vengeance, s4ad not for gain. The damnges ghe claims a n6minsl_ I 10OF, On receiving nows of a death nhe oe her face, rent her gsiifbitta loaded herself with chains, and rashed into the street, invoking vefigeanee on his murderer Bel Hadj was the chief object of her accusation, for there had been a quarrelbetween the two agas ; a;d Abdallah, according to a witness, had deeply insulted the other; " Oh, son of a dog o" he had said to-him, " it is yourfather who ia a dog !" Whereupon Bel Hadj laid his hand upon his beard and swore he would have the old man's blood. It is rather a curious illustration of the insecurity of life in Algeria, that Abdallah!'s wife has been married four times, sad that all her husbanids had died violent deaths. It is positively stated herc -and, if not yet positive, it is certainly probable and desirable-that, In consequence of what has transpired on this trial, and of the abuses proved to exist in the Algerine administration, the Arab bureaux are to be suppressed, and that civil magistrates are to replace the little pashas in French uniforms whose malp:actices have just been exposed. D)espatches were received this morning at the French Foreign-office from M. Soulanges-Bodin, Consual at Naples. They announce that the Royal Court of Salerno waa about to make its report concening the late landing of insurgents, and it was expected that the captain and crew of the Cagliari would be acquitted of participation in the attempt, and that the difficulty with the Sardinian C-overnment would thus be arranged. Despatches from Madaid announce that General Lersundi, who is appointed Captain-General ot the Island of Cuba, wiU sail in the course of September for his new destination, and that he will take with him the final instructions of the Madrid Government with respect to the dispute with blexico. The papers say thatSenor deLafragua,instead of coming to Paris, has gone to Cadiz, and it is added that he was to embark there for his own country. His f dends at Paris seem in the dark as to his movements. We hear nothing more of the mediation of England and France in that quarrel; but there is not the slightest doubt that it was accepted, however reluctantly, by Spain, and that the conference was fixed to be held at Paris. There hsave been repor't aflcoat that Spain had again changed her mind; buat the same powerful arguments that induced her to accept the mediation atill exist. Whenever the cornference is held, it would seem natural that M. Lafragua should come to Paris, as a person completely in possesion of the facts of the case, and highly capable of representing Mexico in the matter, esl he has already represented her at Madrid throughout the tdious non-official negotiation that took place there this summer. Djemil Boy, the Turkish Ambassador, had an audience this morning of the E-mperor. M. de Rayneval's application to return to Rome could not be granted, and he will doubtlems go to St. Petersburg, M!L de Moustler remaining at Berlin. A French officer is to be sent to Tzarko-Selo, where some manceuvres of Russian troops are to take place this year. The Cent Gardes have been despatched to Chulons. The Count and Countess Walewski are going to Biarritz, where Prince Napoleon is also expected to go after his vlsitto the Piedinontese frontier and interview with King VictorEmnmanuel, said to be fixed for the 3lstinast. The Emperor has approved the works now in progress in the foreBt of Vincenres. The Pays says- "cIn a few days more Paris will present the phenomenon of mOt containing a single Parisan but solely foregners sÂ«d provincials. AUl the dwelling-houses in the Faubourg St. Gelmain are closed, and that quarter presents theeapyearance of a deserted city. When the gts are open the jnterior court-yard appears as dismal and a silent as the gerders of the Capulets." The Constitudionwel, in an article on the present organization of the butchers' trade, says:- " What has greatly contributed to envenom the att3cks cf wbich that trade is now the object is the high price of meat. Beef in 1820 cost from 55c. to 60c. the half kilogramme, and in 1841 it was not higher than 7Oc. Sinoe that period it has successively risen to a franc and more. This represents a featfol increase, which weighs hevily on the great mass of consumers. To what cause must this increase be attributed? The consumer, in general, attributes every augmentation of price to the rapa&dty of the tradesman. It is not often taken into consideration th,t the tradesman ismerely an intermediary, and that if he increases the price of the articles he sells, It Si very often because he has been compelled to pay higher terms tg the wholesale dealer. The price of miet has risen and the butchers incur the whole blame thereof. It would be imprudent, however, were the publio to imagine that the act of throwing open the butcher's trade, and the consequent suppression of the existing monopoly, would lead to any notable fall in the price of meat. Doubtless, the suppression of the monopoly Would put an end to various abuses, and it is to be hoped that a weli-conducted trade will produce a Certain diminution in price. But it must not be lost from sight that the dearness of meat is. above a]], to be attributed to the development taken by the population of cities and towns. The production has not kept pace wIth the consumption; thisisthe prindipal cause of the rise, and it is evident that an increased production can alone lead to a sensible reduction in existing price6." The official returns of the average price of wheat in the different markets of France show that tho highest price is 26f. 97c. the hectolitre at Marseilles, in the department of the Bouches du Rhone, and the lowest price is 16f. 65c. at Verdun, in the department of the Meure. There are at present more than 200 boats, forming a double line on the right bank of the Seine, from St. Denis to Epernay, waiting for water in the Seine, and in the canal of St. Denis.

It is pomible that Rome cbampion of the Prusian Cabinet may call in question the corectnes of the foregoipg statement, and it ,may, therefore, be well to state that the two sources from which my information was derived we the beet that can poasibly be had. After a long and diligent sarch in Profesor Koch's great Map of the Caucaus, I bave succeeded in finding the river Koissu or Ssulak, which empties itself into the Caspian, a few miles to the .outh of the Isthmus of Agrachan, and just below a place called Kelentshi. Temir-Chan-Schura, the fortress which the mountaineers took and were obliEed to evacuate, is on the right bank of the Koissu, and about 18 English miles from that river. The place Tscherkei, on which the Russians fell back after having suffered such a signal defeat, is probably in connexion with Fort Eugenieffsk, which lies close to the river Koissu, and on its right bank, but some 15 English miles further north than Temir-Chan-Schura. luformi. tion has been given me by a military friend that the battle lost by the Russians was fought towards the end of June, at a place called Burtunai, which Is situate on the left bank of the Koisau, some 10 miles from Fort Eugenleffik. According to Koch, Wagner, and Bcdenstedt, Temir-Chan-Schura is a regular fort, and a place of extreme importance to the Russians. As a matter of course, Schamyrs victory is denied by the Rursians, but the fact of his men having been within the walls of Femir-Chan-Schura must be considered satisfactory proof that the Russians were worstedc It is, however, evident that the latter are stil in possession of every part of the military road which runs down from Glroanaya to Achti, in Daghestan. Tewir-Cban-Schura is one of the numerous forts which the Ruians have constructed on the road in question. On the 20th inst. there was a regatta at Venice, but only seven gondolas started. The stately galleys of the notables of the city and the barks and bissone of the police and municipal employgs were permitted to move backwards and forwards in the Grand Canal, but whenever a simple gondolier attempted to enter the "tabooed" space he got such a tremendous eousing from the hose of the fire-engines that he was but too glad to return whence he cme. When the Archduke Ferdinnd Maximilian and the Arch. duchess appeared in a magnificent open gondola they were cheered by the public, but persons who were present assure me that there was no trame of that enthusiasm of which the papers speak. The military bands played " God Save the Emperor,' the " Brabangonne," and other national melodies, while the gondoliers were staining their nerves in order to obtain the place of honour. The first four gondoliers were received with enthusiastic cheers by the public; the last three with ironical laughter and those caustic remarks for which the Venetians enjoy a high reputation. The prizes were 250, 200, 150, and 100 silver lire, but the fourth on the list of victors was obliged, in addition to his hundred " eightpeuny bits," to accept a black pig clothed in a scarlet dress. The men appeared so much exhausted by their exertions that some of the English present cane to the conclusion that Venetian gondoliers have infinitely less " bottom" than Thames watermen. After the regatta there wasa "C orso"that is, the Archducal gondola, and the two galleys which accompanied it, went up and down the Grand Canal, followed by a host of barks and gondolas. As no festival is complete in Austria without music, a large gaUey, with military bands on board, led the way up and down the canal. The Vierna money-market is in an extremely sickly state, and more than one great house has bten obliged to sell railroad stock ana Credit Bank shares at ruinously low prices. The fact Is that very many people speculated last year beyond their means, and the consequences are only now begin. ning to mauifeat themselves. One of the larger firms in this city has just made the disagreeable dis. covery that it has-been robbed by one of its cashiers to the amount of 48,000fl. The malefactor, who was arrested on Saturday last, has confessed that the crime with which he is charged was committed above a year ago. His Majesty the Emperor is atill at Preuburg, but wivl leave to-morrow for Kaschan. The Minis. ter of the Interior has taken a short leave of absence, and is gone to Upper Austria. Count Colloredo, the Austran Ambassador at Rome, has returned to his post. The Tunisian Envoy was received by the Emperor before he left Vienna. Yesterday there was a regular panic on Change, but to-day confidence was partially restored. SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 23d have arrived. The Gazette publishes altoyal decree thus worded: "Without prejudice to any judicial proceedings against 3ech person3s as may have unduly thrown into circulation the per cent. stock arising from the amornt deUvered by the Spnih tresury to M. Recur, M a guarntee of the negotiation concluded with him on April 4, 1855, the amount of the dividend-warrnts of the said stock, which may have fallen due, shal be paid on presentation. either by the officers of the treasury at Madrid or by the Spanish offlice at Paris."

LORDS. KENyOZq, RELNB6ROUOH, AN.D TBN TERDBN.* In a third volume confined to the biographies of the above-named worthies Lord Campbell has cor- leted his Lives of the Chief Justices, in addition to iformer series of the Lord ChanceLors of England; and the production of such supplements to a laborious professional life to a ifame honour. ably achieved at the bar and on the judicial Iej oh, is a proof of very considerable powers and of an industry which has not been surpassed 'In our time. If it is not the actual " teste " of ZLord Campbell's pretensions and the seal of his eminence, it is at least an illumination of his patent of nobility, and entitles him to a distinguished place hereafter in some future catalogae vf Royal and noble authors. But, in proporlon as it is all of this it muast not be pre)aumed to exempt him from tie common penalties of ,authorship, or to afford him immunity from the Atrictures of a just criticism. He has ahown a teniency to appropriate witbout suffioient acknowledgunent too large a proportion of the work of his conttmporaries, as we be2ieve Miss Strickland, Mr. *VI'elsby, and others have found reason to complain. Moreover, his inaccuracy in the use of bis materials, maew or old, is so exemplary that in some cases, as in his lives of Hatton and Bacon, his statements Lave been proved untrustworthy to a degree which vas never dreamt of when the public first greeted them with surprise and curiosity. There is this, however, to be said, that in covering with Dmbitious stride a larger space than any one could scan thoroughly axnd in all its details? he has unavoidably laid himself open to correction fr-om parZscons better inaformed upon special points than himaeIf. Putting aside this very obvious ground of complaint, we may accept the present volume as superior in merit to thome which have preceded it on account of Lord Campbell's personal acquaintance with its subjecte. Lord Tenterden has been dead a quarter of a century, but the recollections of Lord Campbell revert so far as to include pariculars of the earliest life in this concluding volume. Lord Campbell was a student when Lord Kenyon was celebrated and flattered as a great magistrate, and ibe himself had a near prospect of becoming Chief Justice wben he commenced his memoir of this particular predecessor. Neither his proximity to the times of Lord Kenyon and his successors nor their community of station has, however, in the least degree fettered ris freedom. Ordinarly a writer speaks with deference and reserve of those he has .known in the flesh, and this treatment, though amiable or intelligible, often conveys to the reader cmu inadequate presentment of the person portrayed. But Lord Campbell has no such delicate reticence, and aims rather at a faithful view of his subject 'which errs, as we shall see hereafter, in a contrary direction. It is the peculiar attribute of this volume that he speaks so unreservedly, and to the be3t of his judgment gives us so frankly, and sometimes so sharshly, his opinion of his own contemporaries. Ldord Kenyon, who wvas hailed as the restorer of the rigd doctrine of the Year Books, is thus prosented to us with all his deficiencies, and, as an Irishman would say, this is a tolerably wide prospect. 3Kenyon was the son of a Welsh squire and was born 1n 1732, at Gredington, in Fintshire. We was taught to read at a dame's sebool, and sent thence to the Iree grammar school of Ruthin,where he stayed long enough to acqulire " a litUe Latin in addition to his Welsh and English ;" but he never knew even the Greek characters, and of no other language had ]ie a smatteriog, except some law phrases in Norman F'rench. He neve- advanced further in the abstract sciences than the "Rule of Three," and he is said piously to have believed to his dying day that the Bun goes round the earth once every 24 hours. With this slender outfit, represented here, in all probability, as slenderer than it really was, Idoyd Eengon vas launched in search of preferment; and, as he was declared to be the "cutest" of four brothers, Lie was dedicated to the law with the view of making him eventually a Welsh attorney. He was articled at Naantwich, and took to his clerkship laboriously but kindly, endeavouring even to emulate a brother clerk, who had an unprofessional turn for poetry, in some stanzas to " Wynnstay," the seat of the Welsh hero and demigod, Sir Watld'n Williams Wynn, regarded by all true Welshmen as the representative of their native princes .- * There Wathin stood firm to Britanniase cause, " Guard of her ancient manners and her laws. "Oh, great good man / borne on the wings of fame, *Far distaht ages shall revere thy name; "While Clwyd's streams shall lave the verdant meads, "And Snowdon's mountains raise their lofty heads; "While goats shall o'er thv hills, 0 Cambria, stray, "And day succeed to nigh0, and night to day; "So long thy praise, 0 Wiams, shall remain, " Unsullied, fzee from dark oblivon's chain." Thus sang the attorney's clerk, to the consternation of his friends, who feared that his poetical talents might divert him from his professional pursuits, and to the amusement of the clerks, his colleagues, who laughed at his muse, and so put a stop to his poetic dalliance for ever. At a later period he was disappointed also in his expectations of being taken into partnership by his master, the attorney; but, his elder brother dying suddenly and leaving hbim heir to the smaU fwnily estate, by his family's ambition rather than by his own he was in 1850 lransferred as a student to the Mfiddle T nple, and Estalied in the fourth story of Brick-co as apreliminary to higher grades of the legal profession. Here he was diligent and untiring in his legal studies, plodding at his law books, or Mttending his former master's town agent to learn the mode of conducting suits at,d the preparation of business for Westminster. Ele also attended the-Courts, taking zotes, which have since been published in two volumes of reports, and he siraAtaneoualy kept accounts of the expenses which a, slender income allowed him, and of which accounts Lord Campbell ctates that they "are still preserved, and contain :mysterious abbreviated items, which have given rise to much speculation and laughte;," but which, Lord Campbell believes, " may be explained without the slightest slur being cast upon his ever exemplary morals." In his student stage he becameacquainted, in the Middle Temple-hal, with Eorne Tooke and Dunning, and they used to dine together at a Chancery-lane eatinghouse ,"paying 7id. a-head for their dinner. Tooke, in gofng an account of these repasts many years after, iust d to say, " Dunning and myself were generous, for we gave the girl who waited on us a penny apiece, but Kenyon, who always knew the value of money, rewarded her with ;a halfpenny, and sometimes with apromise." After he was called to the bar he remained for many years thus obscure and poor, and rode the North Welsh Circuit on a Welsh pony to little purpose until, after Le had been ten years in such scurvy practice, he was desirous of taking orders if he could have obtained the present0tion to a small living to which Lais aspirations-were limited. At this stage Donning, vho was now making thousands a-year, befriended him by engaging him us his " fag" or "devil," and- many hundreds of opinions which Dunning had never read were copied ;iam Kenyon's MS. by Dunning's clerk, and signed by Dunning's hand. Yet the recompense was deferred, for for some time the only feturn which Dunning made was in franlkiDng Kenyon!'s letters to Iiis Welsh relations. On. one of these occasions lie wounded Kenyon's Welsh pride by directing a letter lto Gredington, Flintshire, North Wales, near Chester. " Take back your frank, sir," cried the fiery Cambrian, " I shall never ask you for another?" and lie was flying away in a towering pmsion until Dunning contrived to appease him.' As it oozed out in the profession that Dunnings Dpinions were written by Kenyon, the attorneys thought they might as well go at once to the formtasn head, where they might have the same supply of pure law at much les cost. Case with low fees accordingly came to him in vast numbers and he Jbecame a noted case-answerer. Otherwise Dunning could not help him mueb; having himadlf resumed his stuff gown and gone into hopeless opposition. Kenyon's rise out of his chamber seclusion is attributed, however, to his having made a few useful observations as ainicus' curim, In 'the presence of Lord Thurlow. That 'legal lIon was in the habit of usfigthe learned Harave to prepare notes for his judgments; but Hrgrave was slow and dilatory, and enraged the said lio oonsiderably. Thurlow, therefore, engaged Renyon, and was delighted to find thit he' had fui b srnoo 'iequickest, instead of the motlat gui , of-jpupaen. Though he treated his "'fie roughly5 invariably calling him "Taffy," he conoeived a per- ~Oa lking for hn, and rsolved treward him by. itaisainS him to the bench. When, therefore, the cldef-lusticeship of Cheater vas vacant, and a oesÂ±aJn fea'eant Davenport, wrho might be auppoed to have Shad claim for this appointmnt, made bis applies- *2VU Lives of t7te Chief .Tujkej Of England from UW wom4n Conqwat till Ote Dew)A of Lard ro,&,?dcn. Johzz, Lozd O-pbell, & VOL 3. Miay; Lmdonm l tion in the laconic 3tyle supposed to xuit Thprlow's humour, writing, " 1'he chief-justXceshp. of Ohestee is vacant-am I to have it?" the e 1ually concise but more emphatic Tblrlow replied, "No, by God; Kenyon shall have it," and Kenyon got it accordingly. It is a reflection which Lord Campbell.appeasr to endorse, that we get on in the world more by receiving favours than by conferring them, and such was Kenyon's experience with respect to his patron the Chancellor. The latter, incited by the 8narliug criticisms against his protgg, undertook to push his fortunes, negotiated his return to the Bouse of Commons, and thus put hima in the way to become Attorney-General. Kenyon may well be said in this particular to have had " extraordinary luck," for, though in lucrative practice, he had no forensic reputation. There are only two criminal trials in which he is stated ever to bave been engaged, and one of these was the trial of Lord George Gordon,whomhe defended to the imninent peril and alarm of his noble client, who was rescued in his extremity by the eloquence of Kenyon's associate Erskine. If the trial had concluded with Kenyon's speech it was the general impression that the jury without leaving the court would have found the prisoner guilty. Kenyon, again, was equally ineffective in theHouse of Commons,yet whenLord North's Government was put out and Lord Rockingham and the Whigs came in, Lord Thurlow, continmngto the astonishment of all mankind to hold the Great Seal, contrived to place his old "' devil" in the position of Attorney-General. It should be added that Dunning, a member of Lord Rlockingham's Cabinet, w-as naturally supposed to have favoured Kenyon's elevation. In his new position it is said that he was at first puzzled by questions of international law, but that he qualified himself gradually for this novel duty, while in municipal law he was prompt and decisive. He spoke, however, only on one subject till ejected by the Coalition Ministry, when he stil pertinaciously followed up the same subject from his antipathy5 says Lord Campbell, to the famiy of Fox, but, as he himself contended, from a sense of " the duty he had sworn to perform"-of compelling Paymasters to account for the interest of the balances in their hands. Still retainin,g the Ohief Justiceship of Chester, he tried the famous indictment against the Dean of St. Asaph for libel, in which he exhibited his characteristic Latin, and the Dean the political taste and temper of the age. Employing the classical quotation which he was inthe habitof introducing as particularly applicable whenhe thought it wes time to put an end to any discussion, " Modus in rebus," said he, " there must be an end of things." The Dean of St. Asaph melodramatically protested for an immediate decision. " Let me, if innocent, once more stand up as an honest, injured man; if guilty, let me be dragged to a dungeon." So violent was the fever of constitutionalism in those days that deans, under its influence, could explode in this fashion. The case, however, instead of the culprit, was dragged up by certiorari, and came on eventually before Mr. Justice Buller, when in the following year the memorable struggle took place between him and Erskine. In the spring of 1784, on the death of Sir Thomas Sewell, the Master of the Rolls, Kenyon claimed the vacant office, and it was conceded to him. Lord Campbell avers that Pitt had no high opinion of him or his pretensions, but thnat lie was endeared to the Premier by YerviCes connected with the Westminster election. It is known that, in order to qualify himself to viote for Mr. Cecil Wray against Fox, his house being without the limits of Westminster, while his stables were within it, he had had a bed fitted up in the hay-loft over his stables, and had slept in it several nights. Also, in respect of the " scrutiny" which followed, unlike Sir John Scott, afterwards Lord Eldon, he was a thick and thin supporter of this vexatious proceeding. Thus we can account for the dedication of the "1Rolliad" which came out soon after, " To Sir Lloyd Kenyon, Bart., Master of the Rolls," and for his portrait, with the description commencing thus:- "Behold th' engraver's mimic labours trace "The sober image of that sapient face," &c. The bed in the atable-loft was, of course, too ample a target to be missed, and the horse;, in whose interest it was alleged he had polled, were invoked to convey him comfortably for the future "0 ! may they, gently pacing o'er the stones, "With no rude shock annoy thy batter'd bones, *Crush thy jtudicial cauliflower, and down "Shower the mbed lard and powder o'er thy gown."' At the end of the Rolliad there is a supposed letter of KRenyon to the HIigh Bailiff, apologizing for not paying the damages in which FOx had cast him, on the plea of his (Eenyon's). poverty; and particularly alluding to a story generally circulated that he went to Court in a second-hand suit .of clothes, bought by him from Lord Stormont's valet de chambre, of which, says Lord Campbell himself, I I have heard Jekyll assert that Lord Kenyon never used a poket-handkerchief ihis life till he found one in the poket of this very waistcoat, which pocket-handkerchief he ought to have returned, as it was not included in the bargain." Thus Kenyon's efforts connected with the Westminster scrutiny brought him into trouble and discredit, so that he wrisely resolved to renounce politics and to stick to his judicial du,ties& The last time he addressed the House of Commons was in support of Sir Elijah Impey, whose case he rather damaged by intemperance, thereby playing into the hands of Burke and Francis. At the Rolls he appeared to nmuch greater advantage, though unable to read a single page of the Pandects, and wholly unacquainted with the Roman civil law. Lord Campbell quotes a few of the most favourable specimens of his judgments, which were ordinarily clear and' sound, though wanting method. He despatched business with celerity and precision, so much so that Lord Eldon afterwards said to his son, "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Rtecords do not prove that, if I decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beats us all." This compliment Lord Campbell considers Kenyon to have well deserved, though awarded in virtue of a comparL4on which is of no great advantage, as Lord Eldon, in disposing of cases, if one of the surest, was also notoriously one of the slowest judges who ever sat on the Bench. Such, however,, was the different opinion whicb, curiously enough, it now appears his dilatory Lordship entertained of his own performances. Soon afterwards Lloyd Kenyon was qualifiea as a sitter for Lord Campbell's gallery by bectening Chief Justice of the King's Beneh on the retirement of Lord Mansfield. Mansfield anxiously desired that Justice Buller should succeed him, and so remained shut up in his villa at Caenwood, disabled by age and infirmity, yet without resigning, In order to bring about the wished for arrangement. It was even necessary to hint to him, as to another emii~ent man who has since sat in the same seat, that his retention of the office was an abuse of the statute which made judges irrevocable, before he could be got to sign his resignation. When he did at length resign, Sir Ioyd Kenyon was. sworn in as his successor, and on the aame day was cre ted Baron Kenyon of Gredington. in the counts of Flint. With respect to his promotion, Lord Ca,mp- I bell states that *at the time it was fnuch disrelished. " The gibes of the Rolliad circulated -in society " he had offended several barrister by his hasty and uncourteous manner, and there was an illiberal apprehension that, because he-had pracid wbile at the bar in a court of equity, he must be unfit to preside mn a court of law. EBuller, on. the contrary, was not only "the prince of gp6cial pleaders," and really had dohoe thebusinegs of I the meig's Bench exceedingly.wellfor two years,b Ithe had been in the frequent habit of inviting all grwdes of the profession to the genial d,.whqre they flowing cups as well as flowing courtesy." Nevertheless Kenyon soon appeared to advantae in Westminster-hall, and, altho6ugh not free & r; considerable defects, turned out in spite 'of them to be a very eminent common law judge. - In the House of Lords he was not so aucceewfil. Ho never brought forward any Bill for the *oend- ment of the law, nor did'he even attend to *116 jidiciaI business of the House of Lords. On the other hand, he maintained the untenable' positiot that l6simpe achmenthadabatedbythedissol'tion of Parliament; he strongly opp,o the 1ill pre-. vent vexatious suits for small tithes, and he opposed Foi's Bill for naking juriex'the judges of the lr-as well as of the fact in case of libeL. I neithr "Of these inlrtanoes did he distinguish himself Â£s a legis lator,; and- Lord Campbell observes, that if a Ckefs Justice is to do so little for the public as WI peer there seems no reason why ke should be enndb.l. On the other band, his devotion to his dutie {a Weatminater.hall, his professional learning, his energy, and his probity obtained general approbation. His defects were of a very obvious clas. Of his small stock of Latin he was in the habit of makiug a most ludicrousdisplay. Besidez 4"modus;inrebus," he.would say that, in advancing 'to a right eonclruaion he was determined stasre super aiw. v7, and 'when he declared that there waa pilpable fraud in a case, he would add "'apparehtly latet avgui.s in. herbd." LIord Eenyon, in addition to. his indiscreet dealings with .ths classics$ had also to contend with a Cambrian and ungovernable temper. For a few weelks alter taking hui seat as Chief Justice he is said to have surprised hia friends with a show of coxtrtesy, but he soon gave up the unequal contest, and his brother judges, the bar, and the solicitors were by unsE the victinis of his choler. It is said by a barrister who praotised under him that "' he was impatient even of ant expression of doubt of the infallible rectitude of what he had delivered as his judgment ;" and "whenever his brother jadges venturedto overrule his decisions his manner evinced as much testinesu as if he. had received a personal affront." So also to the bar, with the exception of his favourites, of whom Erkldne was the chief, II he gave loose to an unchecked effusion of intemperate expression, and his language was not chastened by the strict rule of good. breeding." Like the rain which falls on the just and the unjust, plaintiffs and defendants, barristers and Eolicitors, juniors and seniors, were equally sprinkled with his asperities. As respects his judgments, it has often been asserted that " Lord Kenyon restored the shnmDlicity and rigour of the common law," but it would be more correct to say that he successully resisted Lord Mansfield's attempts to bring about a fusion of law and equity. Ha thus maintained against the latter authority that no action at law can be maintained for a legacy, &c. On the other hand, he sufficiently maintained the rigour of the law in sentences incommensurately heavy with the offences in question. When two debtors in the Fleet prison affixed on the gate the following advertisement,-" This house to be let. Peaceable possession will be given on or before the 1st of January, 1793, being the commencement of the first year of liberty in Great Britain,"-to the gratification of his anti-Jacobin fervour they were convicted of a seditious libel, and sentenced to stand in the pillory. John Frost, an attorney, for a few intemperate words relative to monarchy and republicanism uttered in a coffeehouse over his wine, was sentenced to be imprisoned for six months, to stand in the pillory at Charing-cross, to find sureties forhis good behaviour for five years, and "to be. struck off the roll of attornies of this court," whereby, says Lord Campbell, he was to be rendered infamous, and to be irretrievably ruined. So also, on the trials' of Perry, of the Moonting Chronide, of the Rev. Gilbert Wakefield, of Cuthill, and others, Lord Kenyon distinguished himself by the Draconian rigour with which he resisted opinions which he imagined to be revolutionary. On the trial of Williams for publishing Paine's Age of Reason he riade the lip, which is improved so considerably in Coleridge's Table Talk, of citing Julian with Justin Martyr, &c., as an apologist for Christianity, but it does not appear from the report of his judgment that he went, as Coleridge avers, to the length of denominating him "Julian the Apostle." At this point we come upon one of the passages which make the present volume so importaik as preserving for us the personal recollections of the biographer. "I now come," says Lord Campbell, "To a trial at which I was myself actually present-th3 prosecution of Hadifield for ahooting at George ItL. On the 28th of June, 1800, beiDg yet a boy, for the first time in my life I entered the ourt of King's Bench, and with these eyes I beheld Lord lKenyon. The scoene was by no means so august as I bad imagined to myself. I expected to see the judges sitting In the great hall, which, though very differently constructed for magnificence, might be compared to the Roman Foram. . The place where the trial was going on was a small room enolosed from the openl space at the south-east angle, and here were crowded together the judges, the jury, the counsel, tho attorneys, and the reporters, with i ttle accommodation for bystanders. My great curiosity was to see Erakine, and I was aMazingly struck by his noble features and animated aspect. Mitford, the Attorney-Genera seemed dull and heavy, but Grant, the Solicitor-General, immediately inspired tie notion of extraordinary sagaoliy. Law looked logical and sarcastio. Garrow verified his designation of 'the tame tiger.' There were five or six rows of counsel,- robed and wigged sittiav without the bar-but I had never heard the name of any of them mentioned before. I 'was surprised to find the four judges all dressed. eFatly alike,. This not bena aantsday, the Chief Jstico did not wear his collar of 38 to dis. tinguishhim from his brethren.* There vs an air oF superiority sbout him, as if aocustomed to give rile, but his physiognom was- coarse and conrtcted.

Mr. Justice Le Blanc looked prim and precise. From the opening of the case by the Attorney-Generwl I formed a very low estiI mate of the eloquence of ilie Erglishar* but when Ersldnfe began the defence he threwr me into a pi,renzy of admiration, and indeed I shLould have been fit for nothing had I been less exccited; for this was perhaps hia chqf dkeuv-e, an, therefore, she finest speech ever delivered at the Englisht Kenyon interposed, after several -witnesses had proved the mental haUueination of the prisoner, and directed an acquittal, authorizing, however, very properly the detention of the lunatic, though at that time the statutes legalizing such detention I were not passed. Of the many decisons by which he deservea So be favourably remembered some were of great importance. For example, in a trial ariaink out of the conduct of Jlorne Tooke and his associates he laid down the true constitutional doctrine, since affirmed by Act of Parliament, respecting the power of the two Houses to print and publish. On the other hand, he ruled, in the Earl of Abingdon's case, that a peer was not privileged himself to publish a speech delivered by him in the House of Peers with a view to libel an individual, and he very justly sentenced the said Earl to imprisonment. In the case of Madame Mara, the singer, he took occasion to restrain the excessive interpretation of the liability for consequential damages which was then so popular. He also discountenanced the rapacity of surveyors, and charged for heavy damages against the manufacturers of slander. Yet in actions for crim. con. his ardent love of morality, as the cases cited prove, tended frequently to blnd his judgment. In the furious war which he also carried on against gaming, threatening to pillory "the first ladies in the land," he incurred the strictures of the Earl of Carlisle, whose chivalry was aroused to the point of stigmatizing the " legal monks utterly ignorant of human nature and of the ways of men, I who were governed by their own paltry prejudices, and thxought they. must be virtuous in proportion as Ithey were coarse and ill-mannered." The imputa-I tion of being a "legal monk" excited L ord Kenyon's indignation, and he frequently complained of it, or referred to it by innuendo in his observations to juries, till it is said that Lord Carlisle at length threatened to bring. him before the House of Lords for a breach of privilege. No case of witcheraft ever came before Lord Kenyon, "so," says Lord Campbell, "we do not .certainly know iis opinions upon this d subject." But he was enthusiastically devoted to the doctrine that, although the statutes againstforesflusng and regratiaig had, "in an evil hour," been ropealed, .any such offence was still a misdemeanour at com- mon law, and deserved to be punished with exems-| plary severity. His decisions in such aseas are tooI elaborate to be quoted, but they are of a nature to move our astonishment on the one hand, and on the other to rejoice our common sense that such doe- I trines are now exploded. In " Hayeraft v. Creamy," a case of a different . kind, Lord Kenyon was overraled by his brother judges, and the mortification which he suffered was supposed to have occasioned his death. En the autumn of 1801, gazing into the open tomb of his first born, he it said to have' exclaimed, "It is large enough for botL." Atall evemit., the death of this son or " Haycraft v. Creasy," it is difflcult to say which, shortly finished him. He was no longer able to hold up is head, and not even Ia case ffl 'he Oxford' Circuit could excite him. A' soon as term was over he went into Wales; soon afteirwards t6 Bath; blat after a few weeks' illness he died, in 1802, and was buii6d in the grave for which he prepared himself, beaide the son whom he grea#ly lamented. From the facts already mentioned the leading features of his character are sufficiently obvious to dispense with a recapitulation.

ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH. TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE T ES. Sir,-According to a statement in your journal your reporter was nqt permittedc to be present at the recent meeting of the Atlantic Telegraph Company directors. Since then only official versions of what took place on those occaaions have been allowed to appear. Now, I am quite willing to admit that there may be good reasons for this secrecy, but, as it at least shows that the directors have something to conceal, they must not be surprised if both the public and the shareholders regard their ex parte statements undaer such c1rcumstances 'with considerable mistrus6t. 'nfortunately, I have had much knowledge of most of the circumstances connected with the mnanufacture and late attempt to lay the Atlantic cable, and this knowledge induces me to think, that the directors have used the advantages which they possess of hushing matters up rather unscrupulouly. I will not stop to allude to the serious errors which were committed in the manufacture of the cable itself, and which I felt with sorrow at the time foreboded the mismanagement that would eventually ruin all; but simply ask why have not the directors informed the shareholders and the public of al the circumstances connected with the late failure. If the repovts of the directors are to be rehed on, then the statements which are abroad among scientific men are unfounded, and should at once be shown to be so on the most direct testimony. For instance, is it true that during the Agamemmon's trip to Ireland her paying-out machinery was so stiff and unsuited to the work that it occasioned the loss of the whole or greater portion of the piece of cable with which they were testing it ? Did a similar accident, from the same cause, aoaiin occur at Queenstown, when it was attributed to the cable fouling an anchor ? Was the machinery on board the Niagara found, on trial, to be stiU stiffer, and therefore worse, tham the terrible array of wheels on board the Agamemnon, and did an experiment with it in the harbour occasion a further loss of cable; did it lose 11 miles more at Valentia, and did it eventually snap the shoie end calculated to bear a strain of 40 or 50 tons ? When the Niagara was 200 miles at sea did the messagesto the shorebecome so faint thatthey were constantly obliged to telegraph back to the ship for them to be repeated, and even after being so repeated was a considerable time lost before theyoould be made out ? Did many of the leading gentlemen connected with the undertaking state that they believed they wothld not be able to lay the present cable, but that with the experience they would derive in losing it they would be able to lay the next ? Finally, is it true that the most eminent of our electricians consider that the scientific portion of the undertaking has been conducted in a most slovenly and neglectful manner, and that our greatest engmee-. were utterly opposed to the mechanical appliances for paying the cable out? I enclose my card, and have the honour to remain your most obedient servant. Brighton, Atg. 27. B. TO THE EDITOR OF TME TIMES. Sir,-I am not a shareholder in the Atlantic Telegraph Company, but as some of my friends are I naturally have felt very deeply interested in the progress of the great undertaking. I was certainly alarmed by an article whieh appeared in your widelycirculated journal last July, and which, in describing t,he machinery for laying dowrn the telegraph; ;aid: " The apparatus to be used in paying out the cable Is looked upon by engineers as very iii adapted to Itz purpose. With a cable of such extreme lightness and no great stren6th, the slightest po}sble check or hitch ocourrin woul part. it likeo a The friction drama shoull therefore have been of the slightest kind consistent with preventing a rush. Yet, It is no exaggeration to say that the machinery intended to be used is the very reverse of all this, and its massive aspeot strikes dismay into every well-wisher of the soheme."-The TiNme, July 24. As I have said, Sir, this confident prediction rather alarmed me, though my misgivings were partly removed by the statement of the engineers of the company a few days afterwards, in which, referring to the experimental trip to Ireland, they replied to your strictures by saying " The streDgth of the girders which carry the bearings of the entire apparatus, and which to the eye of a person unskdlled in the practical working of this description of machinery may seem at first to be unduly ponderous, was fonnd to contribute greatly to the esy motion and satisfactory steadiness of this most important agent in the success of the undertaking."-The wimes, Aug. 1. Now, Sir, after the steed is effectually gone and the truth of your remarks about the machinery has been unfortunately verified, the directors of the Telegraph Company come forward and publish, as the result of a grand deliberation, that " With regard to the machinery, we are of opinion that the form of controlling power adopted and the mode of lubricating and adjusting the breaks adlmit of very great improvement."-iames, Aug. 26. There has evidently been a blunder here on some one's part. Will the directors, for their own sakes, and for the sake of the confidence which the public ought to feel in the succeas of their great enterprise, explain how it has occurred, and what precaution will be taken to prevent its repetition on the next ococaion ? Yours most obedientlv. A CONSTANT READER. London, Aug. 27. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Tho plan of paying out the Atlantic telegraph wira has often been discussed at our mess table, and we always thought that the greatest difficulty would be found in payiDg out the wire in heavy weather ; but, not knowing what machinery was on board, nothing further was said. Now that an accident has occurred I venture to offer a remedy. All men-of-wars large boats are fitted with an up and down trunk in the centre, communicating with the water tbrough the bottom of the boat. Why should not the sbip bh fitted in a similar way, as then in the roughest weather the strain on the wire would be always the same, the ship pitching only causing a fore and aft motion in the centre, and not an up and down one as it does at the stern I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

WORCESTER MDYSBJAL FESflYAL. (YR1OM OVRU OWN RXPOETER.) WQROESTER, AUGUST 27. AIhough hsastay inWosetateydid oteee 4 hour the Dake of Cambridge made the best use of his time and was visible as often and oni as many different spots as p ticable. Last night bi lRoyAl 'ighness attended th conP at Colleehill, and after'twards partook of refreshment in the Chap%er h6use library, at the inviiation of the Dean. This morning he assisted at early-service (8 o'clock) in the cathe. dral; subsequently inspected the great porcelain manufac. tori of th 'Messrs. Keir (late Ch m'brlainsX t4#rjssing great interest in all he saw and showing his sincerity by making several purchasesT-and, lastly, hoard a portion of Mendelssohn's -Hymn of Praisc in the. cathedraL His Royal Higbness Itfc Worcester by rail at a quarter to L His presence has everywhere created the greatest excitement, and, brief as was the duration of bis vEist, it exercised a beneficial influence on the prospes of the festival, which, owing to harvest time, the races at Hereford, and ethet simultan eous cause,' had not previous to the arrival of his Royal Highness exactly come up to the general expeotations, notwithstanding the glorious weather that prevailed. The second evening concert was much better attended than the fnrt, and this was probably less owing to the temptations offered by the programme than to the anticipated presence of the Commander-in-Chief, whdse intention was revealed to all Woroester by means ofplacards _-"E. B. H. the Duke of Cambridge wil arrive at Woroester at 2 o'clock, and will attend the concert this evening." The good taste of such an advertisement may be questioned; bat the result proved that if Madame Novello, Signor Gardon], Herr Formes, and Mr. Sims Reeves had their attraction, the Dake of Cambridge had his also. The performances commenced with a selection from Der Frec,hutz, of which the overture and opening chorus were the first pieces. These we bave known produce more effect because better executed; but Mr. Sims Reeves made ample amends by his very fine singing in " Thro' the forests ," while Herr Formea in the Bacchanalian song, which he. gave with prodigious spirit, winning (and' taking) an encore, kept up the good impression; and this was in no way diminished byMadameNovello,in the great scene of Agaths-Anglie, " Softly sighs the voice of evening." The other pieces were the trio from the second act (by Medsamee Hepworth, Weiss, and Mr. Montem Smith); the beantiful romance of Agatha, violoncello accompaniment, so great a favourite with Jenny IAnd, extremey well sung by Madame Weiss; the Bridesmaids' Chorus, and the Huntsmen's Chorus, neither of which lst could be complimented for precision and delicacy. The Duke of Cambridge entering the hail while MadameWeiss was singing, the performance of that lady wu arrested and the mational anthem substituted, the solos being delivered with marked energy by Madame Novello and Mr. Sims Reeves. All the audience rose to welcome his Royal Highness, aed remained standing during the anthem, at the end of which Madame Welss resumed the song she had temporarilyabandoned, beginning again from the beginning, amid great applause. Valentine's air from the 4th act of the Huguenots, sung by Miss Dolby in her best manner, suggested a comparison between the styles of Weber and Meyerbeer, from which both may be said to have come forth with honour. The two were fellow-students under the notorious Abbe Vogler, a name which is likely to pass down to posterity through the celebrity of pupils whose genius was a proof against the most absurdly pedantic system ever inculcated. Auber'e delicious barcarole, "Young Agnes," from Fra Diavolo came next, It was sung by Sig. Gardoni with the utmost grace and feeling, and repeated at the desire, we believe, of the Duke of Cambridge. The first part ended with an extremely neritorious performance of Mendelssohn's first pianoforte concerto, by Mr. W. G. Cusins, who would have deserved still greater praise had he taken the last movement (the opening more especially) at the proper speed. The second part is subjoined- Symphony-(No. 8) Beethoen. Reidttlyo and Air-" Oh ruddler than the - cherry," . - - HandeL Song-" The Arab Maid, " Jon B h ruett. DuLotto-" Amor i pcssentenome r- RorfnL Flon-" The Viuwge Blackanith," Weis. Oavatlna-" Al fotse s Inc," Verde. Quarteo-(Rigoletto). VerdL Benediction of the Ponierd3 .ejerbeer. The glowing love-song of Polyphemus was given wlgh immense spirit by Mr. Thomas, our young and rising English bass; Mr. John Barnetto "Arab Maid," a new ballad and a very pretty one, was sung with feeling by Miss Palmer, whose method of producing the voice, however, belongs to a false school, and (as the voice itself is good) should be carefully considered; Madame Novello and Mr. Sims Reeves took strange liberties with the onoe so popular duet from Rossini's Arrmida, almos the only unforgotten piece ia that unremembered opera, and which is melodious and beautiful enough to be sung in Its purity, as Malibran and Rubini used to aing it; Mr. Weiss gave his own " Village Blacksmith" in his own accustomed hearty maner; Miss Lonisa 'mning was encored in the last movement of the air from La Traviata, which she executed with a great deal of dash and brillianey in spite of the carelessmess and irregularity of the orchestral aceompaniment; the quartet from the lat act of PjoleUo iMadame Novello, Miss D1bly, Signor Gardoni, and Herr Formes) "w went"-almost to pieces; and the great choral secne from thefonrth act of the Huguenots by no means reached the Royal Italian Opera standard at. the late Covent-garden Theatre. The symphony of Beethoven-the one in F, which some have entitled the " ballet symphony," from the vein of exquisite tune that runs through it, although it presents many of the most daring strokes of its composer's very original genius-was not quite so well played as the symphony of Mendelssohn on Tuesday, and that, it may be remembered, was by no means irre. proachable, The violoncello accompaniment in the trio (as recently established by Professor Bennett at the Philhar. monia Concerts) was assigned to one instrument instead of several. This was " according to Beethoven," and, the task devolving upon Mr. Lucas, the passages were exeouted with the accustomed acocracy of that experienced musician. The symphony in other respects was marked by a want of finish and a want Qf " point" that rerdered its performance anything rather than satisfaotory, It was listened to, nevertheless, with undeviating attention, the majority, without possibly knowing why, being evidently relieved by this long ana continuous piece of the satiety inseparable from an uninterrupted succession of fragments. After the concert the more privileged among the audience repaired to the Chapter-house to avail themselves of the hospitality of the Dean. The musical parttof the early service to-day comprised "Venite," grand chant (Humphrey); psaims, double chant No. 101 (Dr. Crotch); service, Croft in A; and antbem, " Cry aloud and sbout" (Isaiah xiL 6) (Croft.) The choir was crowded to inconvenience; but it is to be feared the major part were tempted less by the devotional solemnity than by the knowledge that a certain illustrious personage would be present. That ilustrlous personage, however, set an example of devout and unremitting attention which well deserved being followed. The sum of 54 4s. 2d. was colleeted for the charity. The performances to-day In the cathedral consisted of Mendelssohn's .Hpmn of Pmr-xise, some pieces from Mr. Costa's Eli1 and various songs, duets, and chcruses from Handel's Israel in t gypi. The noble 'vork of Mendelssohn had never before been given at Worcester, and waa thereforp a great attrsotion, The execution on the whole -wav very good, and the effeet of the three orchestral movements far beyond what we could haie i6agined it would be in the nave of a cathedral. Evorydeil, eventothemicest combination, was clearly and distiuctly heArd, The choruses were not altogether sO &satisfact4ry, but tJie sublime grandeur'of that which foreshadows the redemption of mnankind, '"The night is departing, the day- is approaching," wasearnestly felt by all who.lis4ened Jto_t, its burst of massive harmony reverberating through the eisles, and its solemn meanng penetrating to- every heart, The corale, "IeL all mden praiseothe Lord," fist idl harmony, and then thundered forth byali thWe vois i ,1iidoi, to ani ngeniously-elaÂ«or&te orchestral accompaniment, produoed an eqal impresslon.

The 4reatment of the decorative aocesorltk which has restored them to their first condition of, eoellenco caunot be too strongly commended. The new carving ha all the genuine art-feeling as well as the precise character of the old, and in its execution it is of the very highest order.

Nor should the inte;esting and historically, valuable- eries of monuments be neglected. And, again, mauph may be done on the exterior of the fabrio; there are buttresses, and corbel-tables, and windows, and many square yards of masonry, and, by no means leastAkthe series, there are sundry strange pinnales and a oerainoble tower which plainly declare what their requirements ae. I need not even glance now at other matters, but rwhlle all these things are yet to come I may, and I am bound to, congratulate the Dean and Chapter of Worcester, and the country - at 'large, on whit has been effected for thbi national edifice.

Mr. JoNwa ob jected to a reference that he (Mr. Jones) hadbeenthesolicitor to the company HeT ad onlymated as solicitor to the compauy since the 1 th of Auguat. The CoaxsarsisoNzER (to Mr. Fleming).-YouL say that cash was not paid for about 1,200 shbares Mr. FLsFNare.-isatead of cash being paid shares were taken, so that in fact money was not paid. The Com issioNwEs.-The value of the gardens repre. aented 1,400 shoaes at 101. each, and the owner wasthe holder of those shares as fully paid up? Mr. PLEM]NGn.-Yets. The CosmrcssIoNBR.-I undepsetnd Mr. Coppook was the solicitor to the company. The gardens at the comnience. ment wouldl owe to the company 14h0001., and the amount was taken in sh vyes. Mfr. FL=xGssr.-Yes. The company gave Mr. Tyler 1,400 shares of 101. eaaah and of these Mr. Cappock took 1 100t the real vnae of the premises at the time not being 2OdOl. The Co:ilmissroNit.-You. depose that youa do not Ibelieve thbat the valuze of the propety was 2,0001. 1 M1r. FLaMN'sGr.-And if I had said not one farthing it would have been nearer the mark. (Eear, hear.) The ComnissioceeAnd you say that a splentia moife had &c., have been erested, which wct l be subie,t to a new heavy fine when the Dean and Chapter come round again. (A laugh.) Mr. FuLEe O.-Yes; and, under these circumstances, not only shareholders but creditors (hear) join in requesting that the compuay may not be subjected to a compulsory winding rp. Shareholders believe that the company could be SllC eesefrly carried on by a committee appointed by themselves. This is the opinionl of lfr. Nelsen Lee and other practical zen engaged in theatrical occupations and as caterers for the public amnsament. There are not at present direotois sseÂ¶cient to comply with the company's deed of partner- The CoMarasxohe-Then have some of the directors ceased to be dictors? Mr. FLnnNG.-Yes; the original number was six; three have resigned, and no number less than four can aot. Mr. Coppock.-That statement is simply untrue. There are lour directors. The Conrissiomm-Who are these? Mr. Coppock.-Mr. Holmes, Mr. Baine, Mr. Webster, and Myself. Mr. FLz3rno.-If there are four, al I can say is that some of them have disappeared. Mr. Coppoclr.-That is untrue. The Coereussro.Nwm-I will leave the court if gentlemen will not lea.n how to conduct themselves in a court of justice. Mr. FiL sNG.-Since the gardens have in effect gone into other hands they have filled every night, and a profit of between 2001. and 3001. has been already realized. I have now an offer from a party who will take the gardens for o-e month for 400L, and pay the money down. (A. laugh.) I say this because it is nocessary in these times to have the money down, (Renewed laughter.) The Comia:sseorxe-Have I any diecretionary power? If I do not grant the required order, can I make any other order ? mr. FLeacG cited the 72d clause of the Act under which the petition was presented. It N7ps there set forth that apcon the hearing of a petition presented by a con. tributory the Court msght dismiss the spid petition, with or ithout costs, or " make such other order as to the Court mnight seem iust.' The CoasMeaseoitxn.-What is the total number of share. holders?9 Mr. S3mITII.-193. Mr. FLnasIMG.-Anda have no doubt, if time be alUowed for inquiry aud investigation, that we shall have four-fifths of their num'ber with us. Mr. CHThLEY -aid that he representei several share. holders and creditors who were dotirous to have the company wound up out of court. He suggested that the 72d section was intended to give this Court a noower analogous to that pos"essed by the Court of Chancery-that of instituting inquiry whether a company should he wound up or not. The Court mighi refer the matter to its registrar or official assignee, and upon their report the Court might decide whether a winding-up order should issue. Mr FLEmiLNG.-I simply ask the Court to dismiss the petition and leave the shareholders to take the course they think proper. The CooemissioNmt.-If I take this course, who will have the control over theproperty? Mr. JONES.-The directors. Mr. FLEMJING urged that the deed under which the com. pany was formed provided that in certain cases the shareholders should have the power of dismissing the directors. The Co3nussioNnR.-You say this Court is not asked to interfere until the shareholders are sat-isfied that this would be the best coursc. ("Yes, yea," "-hear, hear," and applause.) The question is whether the most judicious course would not Xe for you to ask me to alow the matter to stand over. (Hear, hear.) I say this without knowing the language of the deed. Mr. FLxetzNG.-Mr. Jones will state vvhat that is. Mr. JoNBS.-I do not know it, I have never read the deed. The Coemuissxocxx (to Mr. Jones).-Are you the solicitor to tho company ? Mr. JoNEs.-I wish to state- The CoxmIssIoNER.-Are you the solicitor to the company ? Mr. JONFs.-Yes; and your Honour will, I am sure, allow me to state tho circumstances under which I have become so. Mr. Jones proceeded to state that on the 3d of the present month of August he was on bis way to Greenwich by one of the steamboats, when he accidentally met with Mr. Frederick ChappelL Mr. Chappell then told him that he (Mr. Chappell) was the solicitor to the conipany; that the company was all up; that it was being sued in every direction-among others by MI. Jullien, ard that it must go. He (Mr. Jones) having received this information went to his brother, a contributory, and, being himself a Fhareholder also, It wasagreed thathe (Mr. Jones) should go down toMr. Coppock. Theaffairs of the company were stated to be in a " terrible mews," and on the 6th of August Mr. Coppook saw himself (Uf.. A. Jones) on the subject. Mr. Coppock then said,-" I don't mean to let Chappell have the winding u; will you act ?" He (Mr. Jones) said ho would. Mr. Coppock then said that prompt step's must be taken without showing favour to any one. Among other resaing demands there were tbree on 12 days' writs on bills of exchange, to which no defence could be made. Prompt steps were thus necessary to give protection to the company. The Co0itnsioNzR said no one who knew Mr. Jones would charge him with collusion, or doing anything thati was not right. Mr. FLEsING.-WO make no imputation on Mr. Jones. The CoefmissIoN'EP.-The only question is wbat is the beat course to take. The inclination of my mind is that the matter had better stand over. If the majority of the shareholders consider that the concern may be made profitable, they bad better take such steps as they consider may enable them to put the managemeat on a satisfactory footing. Mr. FLEuSINa.-Your Honour has just stated the course that will be the most agreeable to the shareholders for whom I appear. The CoMM}ssIONzER.-To obtain la windirg-up order is practically rushing into bankruptcy-it is bankruptcy in name, if not in fact. Mr. Charles Jeffreys, of 21, Soho-square, wished to put cue question to Mr. Fleming. Mr. FLE?eING.-HOW many shares are you the holder of? Mr. Jeffreys.-One share. (Laughter.) I wish to know whether the two gentlemen for whocm hr. Fleming appears (hlr. Beale and x. 3ullien) were not direotors at the eime the dividend of 10 per cent, was deolared t MIr. Fumica.-t, Jullien never wasa director, and Mr. Beale sent his resignation some months ago. Mlr. Coppock, on the part of the directors, who were the holders of more than one-halt the shares of the company, wished to sA a few words. 1,612 shares were held by the directors andtheirfriends. (A.voice, "And their friends.") The directors, it appeared, were the holders of very nearly one-half the shares of the company. The Commissio-s-Whioh directors? Mr. Joxws.- -The names already given. Mr. Coppook.-I will give thenm again-Mr. Coppook, Mr. Bain, r. Holmes, and Nfr. Webster. After a short interruption, Mr. Coppock resumed He (Mr. Coppock) was the holder of 1,100 shares; his brother held 100; Mr. Baine, 50; Mr. Holmes, 25 - Mr. Beale 25; Mr. Wyld. hIP. for Bodmin, 25; and Mr. Henry Boddington Webster (who joined the company only last Christmas), 50 shares. Charges had been made against himself (Ur. Coppock) which had given him the greatest pain. He had never received so much as a shiling of the company's money. Not any one of the directors had received so much as a shilling, and none bad gone for any other purposes than those of the company. He repudiated every charge made against bim, and he chal- lenged the fullest enquiry. Charges had been made by persons who ought to blush for their conduct-by persons from whom he oould read letters suggesting co, -ked accounts and the management of places. AlosioaL had even been made to criminal proceedings-criminal proceedings for wbat? Tho circumstance would be a lesson to him. He had advanced morey beyond the amount of his shares. He had never sold or trafficked in the company's sbares; he had never parted with one share. The fact was that, from certain circumstances, the receipts of the gardens durinn the present season had been 12,0001. less than might havo been expected. He and the other directors had done their duty fairly andhonestly, and be bad nootherobject inview, He believed that the property wac a valuable property. He thought that a winding-up order would be the best course to take for making the best of the property; but he was quite willing to agree to any course that the Court might approve. ie would not, however, allow his charaoter to be assailed and his reputation damned, wheu the only error he had fallen into was an error in judgment. (Applause.) The Co3ldussroEms.-The best course is for the sbareholders to consider the matter. If the majority should then say, "Let us have a windg-up order " I can have no objoction. The creditors, I should thin, are quite safe. Mr, lJl G0,-Ys eitos to the amount of 10,U(01. have sanctioned the course which I appear to port. gp Mr. JONES.-No. Mr. Coppock.-Hoow many thares do the 63holders repre. lr z3r.}enAi t 7 r i.Jullien-1 am the holder of shares to the amounjt of' directors excep one. i Aiter some discussion, fr..

The CoMMnssIoNs asked whetier the solicitor for the company could state the terms containcd in the deed t Mr. CAT?PELL.-Idlew the deed, but I really do not re. collect its terms. Mlr. Coppcl: said one of its provisions was that there maust not be less than 4 directors who were the holders of mot less than 25 shares eaeh, This number could not be found among the entire body of shareholders if the present direotors were to withdraw. M1r. PLEMIRG said that if a winding-up order were granted the shareholders wished to know where their pro. petty would go to, and how they were to obtain the infor. mation that they desired. The ComsSsio17 -Ar. official liquidator would be appointed. undet any winding.up order, and he coild get at everything. lr. Coppoclc said he and the other directors asked for a winding-up order in this cout aS the heat mode of institu. ting due inquiry and protectinz their characters. hr. COOMEE said, the affldavit he had made contained facts which were most extraordinary. He wanted time, The CoMnssioNxR.-You sball have that. Mr. JONEs.-The directors are wiling that any gentleman shall be put in nomination to act as joint liquidator. The Comsveso~Nz.- -I have no power to appoint maore* then onequidator. The betcourse itoorder an adjourn. ment. Mr. JoNEs applied, under the 84th clause, for an order restrainig actions; also for an order appointing a receiver. gl he Cormassioxx m aceded. Mr. GEORGE applied for an order that Mr Seaole might be permitted to investigate the company's accounts, so far as they referred to the receipts of A beneft an M3rs. Seacoles behalf.

MEBThTING Ob MIDDLESEX MAGIST1A TE& Yesterday a meeting of the magistracy of Middlesex wau held at the.Sessions-house, Clerkenwell-green, to take into consideration business relating to the county; Mr. PownaU in the chair. CORONERS' 1S. Upon recommenunations contained in the report of the Committee for Accounts and General Purposes, coroners' fees in certain cases were disallowed, and others were post. poned for further consideration. Mr. KRmsirnan called the attention of the Court to some proceedingsin reference to these matters at the Yorkshire Wesslons, the result of which, he said, would be, if the were upheld, that this Con i would have to stop the coroners' fees in many more inseances than now. He there fore hoped that the coroners for the county would attend at the October Sessions, when the question could be entered upon and fully disoussed. The CHAIRMn; 3aN d it was an unpleasant duty cast upon the committee to investigate these accounts, and they reluctantly performed it. The coroner's office was an important one, and he thought the best course would bw to ask the com atte to report tothe Court as to tha des irability of the coroners being paid by adoquate salaries instead of fees, and if t'cey were of opnion that such a change was necessary, the Court would take steps towards furthering it at he next session of Parliament. The ASSCSrrTrJUpue said the coroner wras bound to act is many cases in which the m agistrates would refuse the fees, and certainly a change in theplaw, ohich wasaouh ver anomalous upon so important a matter, was required. The Chairman's suggestion was adopted. SLAUOHTER*HOUSE LIOZh'SES. The CssLURIiAN referred to the Mdetropolitan Market Act of this year, and said it was necessary tbat the magistrates should hO aware that the power of granting slaughter-homse licenses was transferred to the local petty sessions-a great advantage-and that the 2d of September was the last day for giving notices.

THEi TELEGRAPH TO INDIA BY TBE RED SEA ROUTE. Severalletters oontining matter of much interest on this ' in}ortit aSbjct hssvt eoently- been'addressed to the chiirnulof the Ea tIndlatuAy by ?!r>M,aishman, the choirman of the asaociatior- formed for the vonatrpctim of a ThesegrVii line ,by. 'way of the Red Sea to India These letters state thea,dsws of the assocation E conreidou with theSr great undertaking, and the advantag4 and difficultiee -of the B. Se* liMe of roate witht rmuch clearness and impartiality. Reference in made to sonme previous commudication to the Court of Dirctor, about two years ago from an association formed to construc t a telegraph from the Datdanelles to Alexandria, witla yviewr to its extension to India, ana the proposal was then favourably received by the India-house. Circun. stances at that period induoed the parties to leave their project in abeyance pending negotiations wixth |the Eyptian and Turkish Governments for firmnana to ay the cable down in the Red Sea. These firmans aving recently beea obtained, the promoters of the undertaking consider themselves In a position to resume it with all neoesary powers. Referring to a proposed llne of telegraphio communication to India through hesopotamia and down the Persian Gulf, the promoters of the R}ed Sea line repudiate any wish to interfere with any arraugements that have been made, though they express a strong opinion that any pro - poeal which ahould secure to India telegraphio communication within a certain period ought not to be delayed without the gravest reason, even though the result should eventually be a double line. Having exclusive posseseion of a firman from the Pasha of Egypt and the Sublime Porte for the Red Sea route, no necessity exists for the exertion of any political influence in negotiations, nor for any further delay. The assooiation therefore proposes to establish telegraphic communieation from Alexandria to Snez by land, and from Suez to A\den, and thence to Kurrachee by a submarine cable. The distance from Alexandri to Suez is 240 miles; from Suez to Aden and from Aden to Kurrachee the length of the cable required will be no lees than 4,163 miles, divided into aections, none of which are to exceed 500 miles in length. The expenses of the vhole undertaldng from Alexandria to Eurrachee, with a liberal allowance for contingencie, is estimsated as being at the most 700,000g. The asodation also calculates that the time for constructing and lying down the Cable, dating from the period the manufaoture commenoes to the actual opening of the communication, will not exceed eight months to Aden, and four additional months to Kurrachee. It has been assumed that the extensive coral reefs in the Red Sea present insuperable obstacles to a submarine telegraph, but rom a most careful survey of the coat on either shore it bas been ascertained thab the cable can be laid beyond the line of coral, except where It is necessary to approaoh one or two stations, and even at those places the reefs, it is be. lieved, can always be avoided by caref ml soundings. The assistance which the association consider indispen. sable to the organization of the undertaking is a guarantee of 6 per cent. on the capital required, to commence from the deoery of the fist message. Iu return for this concesston he association would give all Government despatches priority as to time of sending. The rate of subsidy accorded to the AtlAntlo Telegraph is 4 per cent. by the Government of the Jnlited States, and 4 per cent. by the Government of Great Britain-S per cent, in all. It is further offered by the association that Government messages from or to India by the Red Sea should be conveyed at the same rate as private ones, and the association agree that all reeaipts, from whatever sources, shall be appro. priated to satisfy the guarantee, which is to cease and determine as soon as the amount has been entirely liquidated. 'With regard to the communication between Alexandria and the continent of Europe, as there are several agencies in the Mediterranean now employed in plans for completing it, the company think there is little doubt that it will be periected by the time the line from Alexandria to Karrachee is in readiness, but if these expectations should not be realized they express their willingness to lay down a cable between Alexandria and the Dardanelles, a distance of 800 miles. Accompanying this statement to the chairman of the East India Company is a letter from llr. Bright, the engineer of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, in which, after giving a decided preference to the Red Sea line of telegraph with India, he goes on to say that the coral is by no mean;s an insurmountable obstacle, as can be seen by the worling of the first Mhediterranean sabmarine line, which crosses coral several times. On the other hand, Mr. Bright expresses his belief that the pro. posed line through Mesopotamia will be most difimult, if not impossible, to maintain, as he has found that " even in the ruder parts of Ireland it requires the most continual watchflness to keep the wires from iiury." Mr. L Gisborne also gives his testimony as to the facility with which the coral reefs in the Red Sea may be avoided, or that even where it is necessary or expedient to cross them in approaching the shore stations it may be done without injury or extra expense in tho construction of the line. The correspondence concludes with a letter from the deputy-chairman of the company, in whuich the writer calls the attention of the East India Company to the abrapt failure of the Atlantic Telegraph, and suggests that the 2,000 miles of cable stiU unused on board the Agamemnon and Niagara can be immediately applied in forming the submarine line from Alexandria to Aden, without further lose of time than that necessary for the vessels to accomplish their voyage. It adds that at thia perioa of the year and in the present state of the money-market it would be impossible Io raise the capital necessary for the purpose of eatablishing the undertaking at once, unless the East India Company woald engage to contribute from the date of receiving the first message between Aden and Alexandria, and in consideration for messages conveyed and priority of transmis. Elon, the annual sum of 20,000l to cease and determine when the company obtained a profit from its general receipts of 6 per cent. With this letter the correspondence closes, and the matter is still under the consideration of the Court of Directors, though it is generally believed that an answer favourable to the immediate adoption of the latter proposition will be returned.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The following suggestion regarding the laying down of the Atlantio telegraph cable is worthy of consideration, as coming from a high naval authority-viz., that it is preferable that the start should be made from the American side - 1. On account of the prevailing westerly winds in the North Atlantic, with the consequcrt prevailing sea. 2. The setting of a certain curr .nt from the west and north-west out of Hudson and Davis Straits and from the shores of Labrador. It is generally known that the voyage from England to Newfoundland is habitually much longer than the retnrn from those shores, and that this remarkable difference is attributable to the influences I have described. It is surely of importance, therefore, that these should be made to operate in favour of, rather than in opposition to, the delicate process now in hand, and there is more reason to assume that by leaving the shores of Newfound. land at good speed, and allowing for the southerly set of this current, less stray cable would be required, and with a better prospect of ultimate success to the undertaking, than by resuming operations from Valentia I remain, Sir. vour obedient sprea,4 A SffABEaOILDER, Westbbry, Aug. 26. -
THE G0OY7ERRNMBfr OFFICEg. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir -May I request the favour of a few lines of your valualhle space to correct an error into which your correspondent, Mr Gilbert Scott, appears to have fallen in his letter of yesterday, with referenoe to the opinions attributed to me on the above sabject ? In the remarks which I made in the House on the motion of the hon. member for Maidstone I nrged the inconsistency and bad taste of erecting a block of buildings in the style of the Renaissance, in a line with Sir Charles Barry's 1reasury-offices, to be succeeded in the same line southwards by another block in a later French style, approaching clesely to the Italian. I said that it would be perfectly easy to do justce to the able authors of thoso comp,ositions by allowing them to modify the external elevations of their de6igns, stl keeping to the very skilful arran gement of the plans, which arrangement of plans I had no doubt had mainly contributed to the success which they had obtained. of I did not suggest, as supposed by Mr. Scott, that no man taste would wish to place a Renaissance structure in proximity to the Houses of Parliament, nor did I intend it to be inferred that I preferred the medisval style of arcbiteoture for public offices. On both those snubjects I gave no opinion. I think what I said was perfectly understood in the E[ouse; and, though I have no intention of presuming to press any views of my own on the subject, I have no heaittion in repeating my desire that before any step be taken a good general scheme of buildings and improvements in that neighonurhood should be determined. ThLt with that view the published plans of Sir John Soane (the former architeot of the Board of Works), those of Mr. Pennethorne (the present architect) might be consulted and combined with the suggestions resulting from the recent competition. That the total cost of the site of buildings should be carefully ascertained and the entire sum voted, providing for the outlay by annual payments proportioned to the progress of the works. As I have aid before, I gave no opinion on the style of the external elevations of the new buildings; but, as it seems to be inferred by Mr. Scott that I intended to surport the adoption of the pointed sty le of architecture, I Mali the liberty of saying that I had no such intention, because I venture to think that for public offices ltalian architoture affords facilities for light, ventilation, economy, and character which the other styles do not poEsess. I am, Sir, your mnost obedient s,,rv nt W. TITI, i i; 14wdxquhlare% Aug. 2?.

THE DOVER PORTBRS. TO THE EDITOR: OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am ignorant of what letters have passed between the Royal and Imperial Mail Packet Company and the porters of Dover; but I know Dover and its port and its porters; I have passed through moS' of the English ports jing towards the continent, and have passed manv oÂ£ the deuanaes between the Thames and the DAnube. With this ernerience I caa aver that " Mr. Robert Griggs, master of the porters' at Dover, is very bold indeed when he says "1 no maa can pDint to a single case since the body was called into being some 59 years ago wherein any one porter has been found gplty of dishonesty, incivility, or of insisting upon more than his proper fare " I do not ask any person who has had the supreme felicity of passing through Dover, but I ask anybody who knows English hotels, English watering-places, or English railway stations, whether he thinks there can be suckx a "happy family" of 30 porters at Dover as Mr. Griggs avers there is. I have thrice passed through Dover, and through the hands of lMr. Griggs's brethren, but buch have been the insolence and rapacity of these men that were I condemued to stop at home or go through Dover I should be " at home" for the rest of my days. My experience leads me rerlously to declare, without favouror inteiest, but thatof truth andpublicconvenience that there is not so disagreeable a port in Ebgland to land at as Dover, for the insolence and extortion of the porters, ar,d the general want of eawse nd comfort in passing throagh' Southampton is very nearly as bad. I would rather wriggle for a dozen hours waiting for water to come in at Newhaven than take a short cut through the Dover Elysiam or through Southampton. If Mr. Robert Griggs had been " master of the porters" at Folkestone, I should have felt it due to himu to support him N, Sir, Dover is a little Liverpool; it is the worst port in England by which a poor foroesKnr could be introduced to the English . he would hate theu the rest of Lis days. Formerly at Dover a voyageur could carry his oarpet-bag from deck to the Castom-house without charge, while his larger luggage came after, providing the aforesaid bag had received on deck a chalked cross. So he can now, [dare say; but the poor fellows " who don't know " don't get a crose, and have to pay; and crosses badly chalked pay, and I have had to pay. On the vary last occasion that I passed through Dover such was the dispute about a cross or no or"58, and the gross insolence of Grigga's pets, that I expected "Her Majesty's peace" at the counter of the Custom-house would have been hroken. Near the large reception or "fleecing" room there is a smaller one, wvhere your luggage is weighed, and where you are barred off fromt tho weighing machine and vhere, judging fromn my personal experienoe, every poor traveller is " taken in and done for" in ipise of the " tariff" drawnup by " the magistracy of this borough," and which hangs on the wall opposite the weighiug.-machine. If Mr. Robert Griggs is he who always weigha at that machine, or the person who comues up when called to xupport the rascality of that "msobine" functionary, he ought to be abolished forthwitb, as onght many shocking and disgraceful evils at most of our passenger lwrts. After the fight for the " cross"'-of chaik-caine a contest about that weighing-machine in the ahlmost dark corner there, I had had my baggage weighed in B4varia. in Switzerland, and in France, and knew, to a pair of boots, its exact weight. Mr. Grigga'sfriend made 24 kilogrammes, or 54b., nto 61h He weighed again and again, grew angry, was insolent. I called gentlemen to witness. We made it rather under 551b. Then catne the charge, "4s. lOd., Sir, if you please." After a desperate argum.nnt I paid 3s. 9d., which was the just charge, and when near that glass outerdoor I was nearly pushed over by one of Air. Grigges 'harpies." If Mr. Griggs wants evidence of the illtreatment and vexrtions practised upon travellers passing through Dover I can fisd him some. I can find him gentlemen who can corroborate all, ard, it my memory serves me as to who were present, every tittle of whaSt I have stated, with farther evidence from their own experience, tending toshow thateven asthe birdadid eat the baked-meats in the uppermost basket upon the heal of Pharoah's master of the bakers, so even does the master of the porters, or the porters themselves, eat up the substance of every wandering Diogenee who passes through Dover in search of an honest man, Encloaing my address, I am, Sir, very obedient[v vours.

The coffin mas convoyed to the cemetery on a gun carriage drawn by Wi black horses, and a firing party of 120 men was contriibuted by the Rifle Brigade. The mournful procession attracted an immense number of spectators as it passed along ihe streets. The deceased was born at Forres, in Morayahire, on the Ist of January, 1789, and entered tho army as ,a pdvate soldier in the 79th Highlanders in May, 1805. He served in that regiment at the siege and capture of Copennlagen and of the Danish fleet, under the late Earl Catheart, and subsequently under Sir John Moore in Portugal, and n the advance into Spain and retreat on Corunnua. He rerved with the Walcheren expedition in 1I09, and was ypresent at the siege and capture of Flushing. He was after:wards present at the battles of Busaco, Fuentes d'Onoro (where he was taken prisoner of war, but subsequently -escaped), the siege of Badajos, the battle3 of the Nive and 2Nivelle, and the blockade of Bayonne. He was wounded at the battle of Toulouse in 1814, and in the following year was at the battlesof Quatre Bras and Waterloo. He rose in 1is regiment to the rank of Quartermaster, retiring in 1849, and his lengthened and distinguished services were in 1851 -ewarded by his appointment to the honorawy office of Fort Mdajor of Edinburgh Castle, the appointment having been conferred by the Duke of WeUington on the recommenda'tion of Lord Panmuze, who was for some years an officer in 'the same gallant regiment. Her Majesty's screw steam-frigate Curacoa, Captain Arthur Forbes, ordered to Woolwioh, where she arrived on hionday last from Portsmouth, with instructions to prepare 'for paying off the vessel, was yesterday morning despatched again from Woolwhich, whence she sailed at 5 a.m. for }?ortsmouth.

T2HE CAUSES OF THE MUtfJYflr BESGAL. TO THE EDITOR 'OF THE lIMES. Sir,-I venture to hope that a few remarks froma one who has lately returned from Bongai after a residence there of seerl yeers may be acceptatle in the presnt deplorable situation of affairs In that preidency. I have seen it stated in your celus that one ehief cause of this mutiny bas been the want of sympathy between the Sepoys and their ol;;rs, man it tas been iAd that the drrumstances ef the kte massaces prove thattset, because regiments have been found to sihoot down thei officers, froma the senior captain to the junior ensign, vXhout sparing any, Now, t3is I utteriy6deny, for the matineeras have in mny isnenceG murdered'thso who have bee- their best friends, and ifor whom they always professed the deepest attach'ment. There was no officer in the Bengal army more inti. -mate with his men, or who understood them better, than the Ilate deeply-lanexted Colonel] S. Fisher, commanding the 0.Sth Irregular'Cavalry. He had been inlndianearly all his life, wes thoroughly acquainted with the native customns an2 manners, an accomplished lingnist, and universally beloved by all who knew hica, bath Englishmen and natives, His native officers were in the hAbit of coming to bis house lconstantly, and they (and freqwemtly a party of the men as well) acompanied him in his sporting expeditions. Yet this regiment have mutinied and shown peculiar ferocity, their Colonel 'being murdered before their e.ee with'ut thfe least compunction on their parts. So in many other instances, when these ruffians have ruthlessly masswred those for -whom only the day before they professed the greatest affee'tion. All these osues prove that no amount of intimacy with or regard for the Sepoys would have saved the offleers ; and thab it is not to the causes thus stated thatthe 'outbreak can be referred. The real causes of the mutiny of the Bengal army are undoutbtedly these:- 1. The missionaries who have been allowed to run over the country, giving the higher caste natives an idea that we want to make them Christians by fair means or foul. A low caste native will be a Christian for 5s. with the greatest pleasure; a high caste man, of course, will not at any price. So much for the good these people do; for the evil they have done let the present state of things and the mur. ders of hundreds of real Christians bear witness to. There are also, I am s3rry to say, missionaries in red coats in India, as witness the exposure of Colonel Wheeler. Who ean wonder at his regiment having been one of the first to m-utiny ? 2. The weakness of the English force in the country both as regards the paucity of Her Majesty's regiments, and also in the case of the few officers present with the native corps. Over and over again it has been urged on the IHome Go. vernment that the system of taking away half the officers from a regiment for staff employ must result in evil conse. quences; over and over again they have been urged to form a "staff corps ;" but no, they stopped their ears like the deaf Adder, and havo now reaped the benefit. A man posted to a regiment as an officer is forthwith taken away to be a grain contractor, a cattle feeder, a master clothier, a head gardener, a stud groom, or a "beak." After 20 years at these trades he comes back to his regiment, perhaps, to take the command of it. Can it be wondered that such asystem has broken down l Again,the full comple. ment of officers isnot kept up even onthe rolla of a regiment, and this has been more especially the case of late years in the Bengal Cavalry. Why, it will hardly be credited that the average number of vacancies in the cornets of the 10 regiments for the last six years has been 20, or two per regi. ment. On the 1st of December, 1856, after the augmentation took place, there were no cornets at aRl in the cavalry, and 10 vacancies in the lieutenants besides, or 50 vacancies in the 10 reglments, to supply which demand some 10 or a dozen were sent ont, It has been, no doubt, very pleasant for the Government to have saved upwards [of 7,o001. .-year by keeping open these 20 vacandes; but when it Is remembered that these regiments have been drawn upon for Staff and other dutles exactly as if they had their fall complement it will be understood that there is one other " chalk up" for the mutiny of 1857. As regards the paucity of Her Majesty's regiments, nothing is required further to demonstrate that fact than the spectacle now presented of mere handfuls of men having to contend with thousands, and the fact of Delhi, the principal town of the North-Western provinoes, being without an English garrison. 3. The intrigues of the native princes and potentates, 4. The system introduced within the last 10 years of pampering, humbugging, toadying, and educating the "-high caste" natives to such an extent as to give them the idea that they are equal to Englishmen. For all useful purpoes the low caste men are infinitely superior-they are the best soldiers and the best servants, while the others are imo. lent, lazy, and insabordinate. It is vain to suppose that a native is to be treated the same as an Englishmna. It is only by keeping him completely subordinate that we can hope to keep the country. Once elevate him and make him think that he is an Englishman's equal, and good-bye to all power over him, The idea of itrowing open the eivil service to natives, and giving them magisteria powers over Englishmen, admitting them into the medical profession, &o. I Such a policy deserves the re5slt that has followed. These, Sir, are the main causes of this frigbtful mutiny, and are quite ufficient to account for It. I only trust that after it has been suppressed an entire change of policy 'ma7 take ple. As regards the fall of Delhl, I hardly regret the delay that has taken place, because the force before it, byourlastaccounts, is utterly inadequate for the work What is wnted is that every single rebel in Delhi may be killed, Nowr, if the city wrere to fall, and 20,000 of these miscreants to escape from it there would be littie satisfaction obtained, I am yours faithfully.

BA rZILWA Y AOCIDrDTS. TO TlE EDITOR OF TIIE TMES. Sir,-Observing the account of another acoident on a rail. way, which might have been prevented had an effeotive communication been at hand between the guard and engine. man, I cannot but presume there is none yet in use whioh is certain in its action at all times. I suggest a double whistle to be placed in the focus of a true parabola, fixed immediately above the guard's carriage, and the foeal set true to the engine carriage. Eis breath would be suffident to blow it through a tube, so that its sound wonld be heard by the enghieman and stoker whatever the noise or rattle of the train might be; or it might be connected to a pressure bag. The same principle might be applied, having the parabola set trae, to the station, to give sigals on approaching It, at a very considerably greater distance than can now be done. A wooden parabola accurately turned in a lathe I fnd the bes for the purpose. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. G. G. w cStmmiBter, Aug. 26.
TsB I{Ewv COmbADIDER AT DELHL-MAjorGeneral Thomas IReed, C.B., who was appointedto the comm andl of the troops before Delhi on the dceath of General Barnard, is an officer of experience, and has seen much service. He entered the a in 1813, and was present at the Battle of Waterloo.r Since he has commauded a division of the Bengal army he has partieipated in several important engagements. In 1846 Major-General Reed commanded r. bngade of the army of the Sutlej, and was wounded and had a horse killed under him at the battle of Ferozesahh. A maedal was conferred upon him for his bravery upon this occasion. RocxEsrn-BRIDoE.-The troops belonging to the Royal Sappers and Miners succeeded in blowing up and destroying another large portion of old Rochester-brldge on Wednesday afternoon, under the direction of Colonel H. Sandham, director of the Royal Engineers' establishment. On this o^casion the two large piers and arches, which defied the heavy charges of ganpowder used on the former occasion of the attempt made to remove them, were snucossfully destroyed, the quantity of gunpowder ued being nealy douboled. In order to insure the charges taking effect on the mass to be removed, 18 chambers had been excavated by the Royal Engineers, under the direction of Captain W. IL Noble, to whom the arrangements for destroying the old bridge had been confided, and in these were doposited the charges of gunpowder, wlhich varied in weight according to the force required to be exerted on the mass. On the the signals being given the whole of the charges were fired suinultaneously by means of Groves's voltaic basttery, worked by Captain IL Y. D. Scott, RE., theo effects of the explosions being so coraplete that no portions of the piers or arches acted upon by the gunpowder remain standing. otherportion of the bridge on the Strood aide was lso succeasful blown up yesterday morning.

Mr. byng. the chairman of the direction, presided. The report, an abstract of which appeared in A7ie limes of onday, was taken as readL The CrRM,s then addressed the meeting, observing thet the proprietors bad already been made acquainted with the result of the half-year's traffic through the report and accounts which had been circulated among them. In some branches of thetraffiJ they had experienced a decrese, and In others an increase ; the result of the whole being that they were able to pay a dividend, which, though slightly reduced when compered with the corresponding period of 1856, was yet higher than thAt which they were enabled to pay for the five previous corresponding half-years. He would first allude to the causes of decrease, which were unavoidable. In the corresponding half-year of 1856 they had alargeexceptioniIltraffic,causedby the return of soldiers from the war, and the large military traffio to and from the camps and military depots situated upon their railway. Then there were the naval review at Spithead and the peace ilUlmina. tions in London, both of which gave thenm for that half-year a considerable accesdion of traffic, They would also bear in mind that the Greenwich fairs at Easter and Whitsuntida were formerly a source of considerable traffic, and their abolition-however advantageous in a public point of view - -had proved a considerable loss to them. Thus they bad caried on the Greenwich branch some 75,000 fewer passen- era, andtaken 1,2001. less in money, in consequence of their suppression. There had also been a decrease in the amount received for the conveyance of horses (principaUy troop horses), and * decrease of about 2,5001. in mails, a considerable balance long due from the Post-office having come to the credit of revenue in the corresponding half-year of 1856. D thngte present summer, also, theywere doubtless tosome exnt -ffering in common with theirsonthernrailway neighbours fromthoattractions of theArt Treasures Exhibition at Mancheeter,whichhadserved todivert a good dealofthe tonrist and pleasure traffic of the season in a northeraly direction. Taking all these circumstances into accoutt, he thought that on the whole it must be matter of congratulation that they had been enabled so well to maintain their gross receipb, and even toshowan actoalinereaseuponthepassenger trafc of the railway for the half-year. Turning to the I head of expenses, they would observe that the line had been i worked and maintained at a somewhat less cost. They had, however, still found it neoessary to expend considerably bhyond the average of preceding years in repairing and re|newingthe permanent way. Indeed, the expenditure on the road for the five half-years ending July, 1855, did not average more than 28,0001., as compared with the 43,0001. which they had expended during the last half-year. All compes had found it necessary, whether they had perma. Inen wy resrve funds or not, to increase the expenditure on their road; for to maintain the way and works in an efficient state was the best economy; indeed, it was an expenI diturethatcouldnotjudictously be avoided. Their engineer ! simnrd them that the road was novi ail mperoi eondltion. One of the principal subjects v ich tgey were aware had recently occupied the attention of the directors had been the prosecution before Parliament of their proposed North Kent relief line, between Leowisham and Dartford, and at the same time opposiDng the rival scheme of the EAst Kent Company. At their last special meeting they were I mde fully acquinted with the steps which had been taken e for the purpose of securing the success of their BEll in the I House of Commons. The committee, after careful conside- ration of the respective merits of the schemes submitted to them, pssed the preamble of this company's Bill, and rejected that proposed by the East Kent Oompany. They I did so on clear and intelligible grounds. They considered that a companv of proprietors who had expended upwards of lI1,O,000U.sterling in providing railway accommodation for every place of importance in Kent was entitled to consideration; that having fairly carried out their intentions under the powers conferred on them by Parliament they were entitled to protection against new |partes who came into the field late in the day, and sought, Dy forming unnuecessary duplicate and competing lines of railway, to tak-e away the traffic which the company ori - nally sanctioned had in a great measure created; for t a hne proposedl by the East Kent Company merely sought to give a second and independent access to London to towns already accommodated by this railway. The committee of the House of Commons, acting on the recommendations contained in the report of what was called Mr. Cardwell's committee, rejected the Bill of the East Kent Company, as they had failed to show any clear grounds of public policy to warrant the concession o a new competing line of railway, calculated, if formed, to diminish that just remuneration to which the proprietors of this company were entitled for the large amount of capital expended by them in the construction of extensive and costly works for the acommodation of the public. Before, however, passing the preamble of this company's bill, the committee, conceiving that the provision of an access to the west end of London was an accommodation that this company should provide for the traffic of Kent and the continent, called upon them to give them an undertading that they would call their proprietors ingether with the view of providing such an access. This the directors agreed to do, as was explained at the special meeting held on the 9th of nuly 4stt after which the proprietors approved the Bil as passed by the House of Comrmons previous to itA introduction to the House of Lords. The committee of the Lords, however, did not think properto confxrm the deoision of the Commons, and, as the meeting was aware, they rejected the preamble of the BilL Their lordships would seem to have been inflnenced by the oonsideration that the pledge which the directors had givento the House of Commons' committee had no legal effect in binding the company to provide the desired acoess to the west-end, either by itself or through other parties; and ag, in any event, they must come to Parliament1 agun in the next sessionfor the purpose of fulfilling that pledge, their lordships would rather that they eame before them with a scheme complete as a whole than pass the Bil inan incomplete form. The statement of the chairman of the Commons' committee, that he had granted the preamble of their Bill "reluctantly," because of the alleged shortcoming of their plan as to the west-end access, had, no doubt, considerable influence in determining the decision of the Lords' committee In postponing the measure. Now, although they might consider ehemsel strictly speaking, as absolved from their pledge to the Commons by the rejection of their Bil by the l ords, it did appepr to him that they would be best consulting their own mte-ests were they to act as though the pledge were now in actual existence, and just asif they had obtained their North Kent relief line. They had stilt to devise the best mode of effectually protecting their property against the encroachments of rivals, at the seine time that they provided the public with the largest amount of accommodation that could reasonably be desired. The time had not yet arrived when the directors coud lad their plans with this object beforethem ; but an early opportuntty would be taken of calling the proprietors together, and acquainting them with the measures which tiey recommended, and in the prosecution of which they expected, as heretofore, to receive the cordial support of the proprietors. He then moved the adoption of the report and accounts. Mr. GoRDox THomPSON seconded the motion, IL-. M'CLAPCN said the explanation the chairman had given in reference to the diminution of the revenue could not fallto be satisfactory. According to an analyastwhioh he had made of the accounts the actual decresse in this halfyear, as compared with the oorresponding half-year of 1856, was 4,652 lOsa. Sd.

There was evidently a determination on the part of the East Kent Company to get an entrance into London. If so, he did not know what would become of the South-Eastern Company. The CHAnnLu?.-I hope they will not. I do not like to be positive, but I have not much fear of their succeeding. Mr.hl'CLAitEN.-At allevents, he hoped the directors would keep their house in order, and at once take the bull by the horns. Their object ought to be to make the SouthEastern Railway a permanently productive company. Mr. G. Satirn said if he was correctly informed there was a person occupying a high position at their board who had ale East Kent Company, whose interests were anta~gonistic to theose of the Sot atrnRiwy He understood that Mr. Coles Child was interested both as a landowner and a shareholder in the Fast Kent Line. He therefore thought the position of that gentleMan very equivocal, believing, as he did, that no man could serve tho :masters Mr. C. GrnP'rTs, XP., owed it to an absent director to declare his conviction that Mr. Coles Child hadi not been inflenced by any interest which ho might be rupposed to posses in opposition to tho interests of this company. On the coxntrary, he believed there was not a more useful member on the board than Mr. Coles ChiUd. Lord A. PAGXr, P.P, condemned the systei which he had seen pursued year after year, of parties bringing forward schemes merely for the sake of cutting off 10 miles here or five miles there, without any earthly advantage, either to themsves or to the public. AndI what was the end of it? Either an amalgamation or an agreement between the parties to charge the same rates, or else a continual fight against one other, to the great injury of both. He should do his utmost to put a stop to this system. He hoped the directors would not forget his own little scheme at Folkestone - and as the were now aware of what were the views of ParEniaent he Mrsed they would maturely consider their plan before they again went, before the committee. The report was then received and ad p ed, Mr. RicHe, in reference to the prooeedngs before Parlia,% m3ent, observed that a committee of the House of Commons was the most incongruous tribunal that the ingenuity of man couldt have devised. He reallv believed it wa's formed for the expresspupose of puttintmoney into the lawyers' pockcets. ("H esar, hear," and aughter.) However, their case was a goodl one, and he had no doubt bot withisn a, phort period they would bg able to I ring torth suaa hsem, a Mwoul 4 both j PsriI. 3meat and the people of Kent. Mr. G.

BRISTOL AND EXETER. The half-yearly meeting of this oompany was held at Brist-I yesterday, Mr. J. W. Baller, X.P, in the chair. An abstract of the report and acoounts has appearedin 27ic vmes. The CHAMB3AN, in moving the adoption of the report, said he considered the accounts which had been presented as the subjeot for as much congratulation as any statement 'which had been submitted on any former oecasion. (Hear.) Thedirectors were quite preparedtofindsome decreaseinthe receiptsduring the last half-year, nd so farfrom feelingany surpre At that decrease being 1,3194, which appeared to be the total decrease in passengers, he considered it highly satisfactory, because it was more than accounted for by the single item of loss on the conveyanoe of soldiers, which loss amounted to 2,6031., while the total decrease of traffic in Pssengersofalldescriptionswas,ashehadsaid,onlyl,319& This result, then, he considered most satisfactory, because there were many ircumsances which had a natural tendency to decrease the receipts on the line. Those circumstanoes were pointed out in the report, and first amon them was the Art Treasures Exhibition at Manchester, W hich had undoubtedly materially affected their line. Added to this there was the great competition at present existing among many of the railwavys in the northof Enland, inanyof which were running at the lowest fares, and affording the greatest facilities for travellUng. It was not therefore surprising that the public had availed themselves of the advantages thus offered, and that a great deal of pleasure traffic had been diverted to the north of England There was also another Point to which he would call attention-viz., the opening of the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth line. For Some time previously to the extension of this line from Frome to Weymouth there had been a very large portion of iraffic which passed over the Bristol and Exeter line to Durston and YeoviL Immediately on the opening of the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth line to Yeoval a conider. able portion of that traffic was naturally diverted, and a larger portion was still further diverted upon the completion of the line to Weymouth. These causeshad existed during thewhole ofthe last half-year, and the directors had naturaly expected that from this new souro of communication a very considerable amount of traffia would hAve been diverted from the railway. Under these circumstanoes therefore it waS most satisfactory to 5nd that such was the intrinsic value of the line, and such the growing traffic upon the main line and its branches, independently of all other complanies, that even under the disadvantages to which he had alluded, the total loss in passengers as compred with the corresponding half-year amounted only to the comparatively small sum of 1,3191. (Hear, hear.) He looked forward with great hope to the fature. The aEcounts generally, he trusted, would be oonddered satisfactory by the prorrietors. He thought there was one feature ia them peculiarly favourable, and that was the small amount expended during the half-year on the capital account. (EHear, hear.) The directors were most anxious to reduce that expenditure as far as possible, and he was happy to say that the line,was so far completed that it was not likely any great further expenditure would be required under this head. There might be a single engine to be completed, and some smal expense to be incurred on the carriage stock account, but upon the whole he believed the expenditure generally had been made, with the exception of some improvements which were found to be necessary for the additional accommodation of workmen and tervants at different parts of the line. This had consisted in the building of some convenient and commodious cottages and some smaU purchases of land at Exeter and in the nei bourhood of YeoviL Besides this outlay, there was verylitUe necessity for any further expenditure on the capital account ; and the directors considered this as a subject of immense importance to the proprietors of this company. It would bea subject of great congratulation when the Cornwall line was open for traflic, as they had incurred considerable liabilities in orderto oomplete that line, in conjunction withthe Great Western and SouthDevon Companies. They aIso helda very Large stake in the latter company, and he could not help hoping that the rich district of Cornwall would be found to yield a traffic which should produce a profit quite equal to meet any engagements into which they had entered. He was very sanguine from the character of the district through which the line passed that a very considerable traffic would be found upon it both in passgegers and goods; that the traffic would be large, and that not only would the line be A payingone in itself so far asthe h bilihea of this company were concerned, but that it would prove of material benefit to the South Devon and their own main line. The directors wouldendeavour, as far aspossible, so to control the expenditure on capital account, and all working expenses, as to have the largest amount of profit available to meet any temporary losses which they might hereafter susta (Hear, hear.) He was happy to say that they had no branch lines in progress (hear, hear), no engagements which he h%d to call upon them to confirm, and no intention of expending any money in any 'works or improvements upon the line for which the sanction of the shareholders would be required. He then adverted to the retirement of their late secretary, Mr. Badham, and having paid a warm tribute to the zeal and ability for so many years displayed by tht gentleman in the service of the company, he confidently asked the shareholders toconfirm the recommendation of the directors to grant ir. Badham a pension of 5004 a-year, and concluded by moving the adoption of the report. The motion having been seconded, The CHAIRMAN, in answer to a question by M1r. Perry, aid that the receipts for the seven weeks of the present half-year had been 2,7001 lesa than during the corresponding period of last year. Mr. PERRY wished to know how it was that the coat of the goods agency had increased 7341, while the receipts had increased only 132l Mr. CASTLn said it was a matter for great congratulation that there had been any increase at all in the redpts from the goods traffic, considering the comphtition now existing at Yeovil and in the north. By the completion of the Great Wester lines the Exeter Company had lost the whole of their London traffic, and in order to keep the northern traffic they had to reduce their tariff 30 per cent., this rate of reduction having been made by the Great Westem Company in order to bring the traffio over their lines, which were now completed in the north. It was therefore certainly gratifying that the local traffio of the Bristol and Exeter line had so far increased as to more than compensate for that which had been abstracted. The increase in the cost of agency was occasioned by the manager of the goods traffic being paid a percentage on the tonnage, and not on the receipts. The report was then adopted, ad The C,URMMA? mnoved a resolution deolaring a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, payable on the 1st of September. Mr. J. Baow%xB seconded the motion, and said he believed their line would by and by stand second to none in the kingdom, and he oould not but feel that the statements of their chairman concerning its future prosperity must have 'weight with the public and convince them it was a substantial concern. The motion was unanimously adopted. The CHAIRMAX then moved the third resolution, confering a pension of 5001. per annum upon Mr. Baaham, tho late secretary, and authorizing the directors to take the necessary steps for paying it half-yearly. Mr. AvrsY in seconding the motion said be had been an eye-witness of the zeal and energy with which Mr. Badham had always performed the duties of his office. le was much pleased with the feeling speech of the chairman, and he would remind the shareholders that it could not but be most gratifying to Mr. Badham and his family should the proposed resolution be adopted unanimously. Mr. Badham'e salary was not adequate to his saving rauch out of it for a fature contingenoy, and his ilness had also been so sudden as to afford him no warning. After some observations from Mr. Powell, Mr. Ashley, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Bates, Mr.AsEaY moved an amendment, that the allowance be 3001 a-year, which was seconded ly Mr. J. NASH. The amendmenu was then put, and negatived by 42 to 1L The resolution was then put to the meeting, Mr. Ashley still inststing upon dividine, and carried by a largemajority. envote of thanks to the chairman terminated the pro- SrITITNGBOtIRNE AND SHEERNESS. Yesterday the half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Qneenborough; the Right Hon. S. R. Lushington in the chair. Mr S. J. BREXEZ, the Secretary, read the report, which stated that the company had obtained possesson of more than half the land,-namely, from Queenboron h to a point nearthe junction with the East Kont Raway at Sittingbourne, and that there was every prospect that the line would be finished within the time originally fixed. The Bill for the junction with the Esst Kent Railway, for the extension of the line into the dockyard at Sheernes, and for the construction of a pier, had received the Royal asent. The directors anticipated considerable ravantages from it Inasmuch as the natural position of the pier must attract to It the entire trade of all the exports and imports of the country served by the East Kent Railway, and of some portion of that served by the South-Eastern Railway, while or the embarcation or disembarcation of troops it would afford uuequalled facilities The fact also of Its beine entirely free from city or harbour dues would add mateilally to the preference which its natural advantages wotud be sure to gai fo it with the shipping interest. Thediretors regrette that the call5 had not been met with sufficient promptituLde. Mr. Berkenshaw the engineer, reported that during the last half-year considerable progress had been made in the consructlonof the works and he had no reson to doubt the completion of the main line and branches by the spring of next year. Ths recipts to the 30th of June last had been 24,3691,, and the expenditure less than that sum by 9 388 C The report was adopted, and Mlfr. ]Â£shington and Mr. MIagnus, who retired by rotation, wrere re-elected. a vote of thanks to the chairman and diretors cloced the proceedings. t AMBERGATE, NOTrI2NGEI&M, ANTD BOSTON.

MANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD, AND LINCOLIS- The directors of this compamy have just isved a voluminous statement recting the breach of sgreement between them andthe London anuNorJh-WegkrnCump =y, They contend that theLondonand Nozth-WesernCompey have not performed the stipulations of and have broksib the a&reement of Jaly, 1854; that the London and North- Western haive pursued towards the Sheffield Company .-. general course of bad faith; that they have. M- tempted unauthorized negotiations for an injuriou& territorial division, &c., winthout the knowledge or concurrseno of the Sheffield Compan that th. lIndon and North-We6tern Compes. hlave on vanous occasions asumed a hostile attitdi towards and iefued arbitration when urged by the Sheffield Company; tlat the Manchester, Sheffield, and LJneolnahiie direct were therefore justified in treating the agreement of Jul 1854, as ternmnated by the London and Nor%ILWst ern Company. W~ho heffeld directors further statethat the London and North.Weatemn Comany have sime repudiated agreements and refused arbitration, and thAt t proceedings which the London and North-Wester4 Company's management Is nowl adopting re itheise nor dignified, nor likely to avance the interest of thown shareholders nor of railway property generally.. The Manchester, Sheffield, andLineolnahire Company oes.- tend that they have hono ably performed their par of theagreement. Inconclusion, the Sheffield directors appeal to their own shareholders and the public, and state that the bave acted throughout as honourable men ought to ct under circumstances of extreme difficulty, andtheir conslation is that, not onlyIt 4cours6e they have pursued rlght andjut, uttha i wil,n sltof lltempora.y obstruetions and embarrassment which an angry and poWerful opponent can bring about, redound to the advantae-b ntothoenlpy oif their proprietary, but also to the greater interess EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW. The report of the directors of this company states that enb comparing the receipts of the half-year ending July 31last, with those for the correspnding period of 1856, there 'appearsan increase of 3,836 in the reoeipts for passenerov, of 6,8021. for good and 322 for horses, I d mails, making together ainorease of 10,9601.G O itht tis s In w of traffio there has- been a consderable reduction In thLe working expenses-namnelv, from 60,5611. for the half-um.~ ending July, 1856, to 54.3901. for the half-yea ending , 1857-thus saVing 6,171L The net balano after pa interest, taxes, and rents, and providin 12,OOL to z the claims of the Stirling and Dunermline Company, amounts to 41,4881, from which the directors reoommendpayment of the Sper. centpreference dividend,amounting to 6,2094, and of a dividend on the ordinary stock theirate of three cent, per annum, or 33,=0I., leaings * balance of 1 ,9. A farther considerable sum has been paic. towards the company's subscription to the Glasgow, humbarton, and Helentburgh Railway, leaving 20,0 et to be paid. The new workshops at Cowlairs are al but completed. An addition has been made to the plant. to the amount of 1,2251. on aount of the stock neoeary to work the Helensburgh traffic. Since the last half-pearly meeting the Scottish Central Company has joined in the. agreement existing between the Caledonian and the Ediburgh and Glasgow Company, on the same basis of reociving. L fixed proportion of the joint revenue. The three oompanies have also concluded an arrauepment with the Forth and Clyde Canal Compan , by wldch it is hole& that injunrous competition will be prevented. The agreement with the Cal doniati and. Central Compatis worke. very satisfactorily, and undoubtedlystrengthens the pDdosito of all the parties to it very materiaBly, without anyInjurious interference with the rights of others or the course of traffic. The capital account shows that 3,634,7761. had been received, and 3,588,938/1 expended, leaving a balance of 45,838L The revenue account for the half-year ending the 31st of July showedthat 144,9191. had been received and 59,0131L expended in. -working and other expenses, 23,5471. paid for interest on debentures and loans, 4,1251 dividend on Stirlinahie. Midland Junction stook, 4,70l. rent payable to the din- burgh and Bathgate Railway Company, and 120001. re-- served on account of rent of Stirling and Dunfermline Railway, leaving a balance of 41,41M. ULVEESTONE AND LANCASTER. This line was opemred for traffio on Wednesday. It formr. the connecting link between the Furness and WhitehavenRailways and the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway; and. will! greatly facilitate the conveyance of iron ore to Stafford- shire and other places in the south. The new line is 19niles In length, and extends from the Carnforkh station of the Lancaster and Carlie Ralway to Ulverstone, running round the head of Morecombe-bay. Of the 19' miles eight bave been constructed beneath the level of the tides, creating a necessity for a formidable embankment andsea wall. The remaining 11 mUes run through mountain, limestone. The construction of the sea wall has been a work of great labour, requiring much ingenuity on the part of theenfmeer. h event was celebrated at a sumptuous banquet gv b Mr. Brogden at Furness Abbey to a large number oF "en.-. tlemen connected with railways. Various toasts were given and responded to, and the whole of the proceedings concluded in a most satisfactory manner. GREAT NORTHERN. With referenoe to a paragraph in the report of the comaittoe of investigation, which appeared in 27we Timia of Wednesday, Mr. John Chapman, one of the auditors of the company, states tbae it might be supposed that theauditors had withheld from the shareholders the knowledge of facts with which they ought to have been cquainted, but that such was not the case. He states that at the hlf yearly meetin g in February, 1856, it was announced to the shareholders that the dividends were overpaid, at the same time that the auditors reported that the bookcs and so' counts in every departrment were correct, referring of. course only to the office over wvhich they had control, and from which their reports have been invariably dated. Since the discovery of Redpath's frauds te auditors have given the same certificate, and their oerf6i-- oate has, after a miinute examination, been confirmed by- lr. Deloitte, the professional accountant. Mz Chapman ooncludes by stating that the Companies' Consolidation Actdefines the duties of auditors and in conformity with theb usage inall railway companies the registration departmentt of the railway never came vwithin the province of theauditors. CARMARTHEN AND CARDIGAN. The works on this line are progressng. The embankment between the South Wales RalOway station and Carmarthen-bridge, is more than half completed. The railwary will cross the T owy over a wooden bridge, wvhich is nowr i course of erection. Abourt five miles from Clarmarthen thereis a tunnel, which has been commenced by Mr. Jay, ti,e. c ontractor; and it appears that every effort will be made by the directors to carry out the undertaking.
