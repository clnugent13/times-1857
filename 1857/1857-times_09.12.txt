TRB BBNGAL ARMY. In the uninterrupted discussion of the discipline 1 and general state of the BeDgal Army to which its mutiny has given occasion frequent allusion has been made by Indian officers to the opinions of General Jacob, the distinguished officer whose services in Scinde first made him known to the public at home, and who is now left in chief command not | only of the admirable corps of cavalry which is called after him, but of the division which still remains in Persia to insure the evacuation of Herat. The opinions of General Jacob were embodied in a pamphlet published some years since, and now not easily obtained in England. We believe that we shall afford useful information for the intelligent discussion of the Indian question by republishing this pamphlet, which, with the suppression only of a few passages respecting the bygone controversy with Sir C. Napier, is as follows8- " Let us inquire what realy are the defects and want3 of the native army of Bengal, and the best methods of iemeding and supplying them. Let the officers of the Bengal army apply themselves fairly and honestly to the task of reform, where reform is reallr needed, and let them not flatter themselves, as too often is the case, that they have remedied a defect when they have only concealed it, or denied its existence; old sores must be laid open with an unsparing hand, and the caustic be freely applied, before they can be properly healed; let not the patient think the surgeon an enemy because he gives pain. *For myself, I shall endeavour to write exactly as if I were myself an officer of the Bengal army; my judgment may be erroneous and my opinions unsound, but my motives are undoubtedly good: they are the wish honestly to serve my hon. masters and my country, and to benefit, in my humble capacity, the service to wvhich I am proud to belong. I have served altogether 23 years, have never been abeent from my duty, and have long commanded a native corps of high repute. During the course of my service I have seen a good deal of the Bengal army, and have conversed much with its offlcers. *With the opportunities and experience abovementioned, my observations and opinions may be useles and unsound, but they cannot jusLy be deemed presumptuone or hasty. * The most serious faults existng in and peculiar to the Bengal Army appear to me to be as follow:- "L The absence of tho highest moral tone and of a simple and vigorous Anglo-Saxon honesty in dealing with Asiatics on the part of the English officers of the Army of Bengal. " 2. The want of power placed in the hands of regin,ental commanding officers; the want of confidence reposed in, and support afforded to them, by the Commanderin-Chief and by Government. " 3. The most pernicious system of drawiing pay by companies direct from the divisional paymaster, instead of by regiments, wbich again tends to bring regimental commanders in contempt, and to reduce their power and usefal. ness. " 4. The most defective system of conduicting officers' messes. "5. The entire absence of a proper confidence between the officers and the native soldiers. " 6. The most pernlcious practice of attending to the caste of native so diers, thereby frequently excluding from our ranks the best material for soldiers and enlisting the very worst. '-7. The very bad and fatally injurious system of pro. motion existing with respect to native officers and soldiers. " 8. The entire absence of a proper discipline throughout the native part of the Bengal army. "Ample proof of the frmentioned fault is found in pro5eedings towards mutineers,-in the late orders to the uiengal army regarding Courts of Request, &c.,-in disclosures which have been made regarding gambling affairs, banking transactions, &c., too notorious to require detail. ing, and too extensive and numerous to be attributable to causes affecting individuals only. These proofs are public and ptent to all men. "T The defect being admitted, where shall we look for the cause and the remedy ? One cause appears to me to consist inl the lowering of the English character by insensibly adopt. ing Asiatic habits, nmanners, and feelingg, the Anglo-Saxon becoming partly merged in the Hindoo. This is extensively the case in tbe army of Bengal. "From the moment a young officer sets foot in the Bengal Presidency he is perpetually reminded that every English idea and habit is the sure mark of at griffin (that is, of a tool). He must not go out in the sunshine; he must travel in a palki, instead of on horeseback' he must be punkaed and tattied, and God knows what elZse; he must have a khansamauun,akidmutgar, asirdar bearerandbearers, and a host of other servants, one for his pipe, another for bis umbrella, another for his bottle, another for his chair, &c., all to do the work of one man, and which work would be done by one man in the case of a Bombay griffin. By all these people the youth is called 'Ghurreeb purwar,' 'khoodabund,' &oi. * This state of affairs bewilders the new comer, till, resigning himself to his fate, he becomes accustomed to it, and gradually loses part of themanliness of the Anglo-Saxon character. With the external luxurious and lasy habits of findostan he imperceptibly adopts somewhat of Oriental morality. "Another cause is the difficulty existing in obtaining furlough to Europe, which, if removed would effect a wonderful improvement in the tone of indian society; this cause, although of grave Importance, is, of course, not peculiar to Bengs , but common to all India. ",The remedy is evident-let it be the fashion to be English. It is a fallacy to suppose that the climate compels to be otherwise. There are faults enough I suppose in the European society of the Western Presidency, but assurediy it is ten times more English than that of Bengal, yet the climate is no better than thet of the latter .. Let tne griffln have no siore hisab swo wody eervants at most; let him have no one in his servioe who winot do such workas his master bids him do if the iindoos object to such service, there are plenty of iussulmans ready, willing, ancd able to take their places, and with no more prejudices than a Christian. " Let the young man never enter a palki, but go about on the back of his pony; let him not fear the sun; it may tan his cheeks. but it will not hvrt him. " It is your effeminate gentlefolk, vho live in dark houses, artificially cooled with a dozen Eindoos at work, with fans and flappers to beat the fles offthem, who suffer by exposnre, not the hardy young Englishman, who, if not intemperato, soon becomes acclimated, and the more readily so the less he regards the sunshine, whioh is healthy enough in moderation; experto crede. "Let him, in short, while studying the character of the natives of India as deeply as possible, and making himself completely acquainted with their habits, thoughts, feelings, modes of expression, &c, endeavour himself by all means in his power to remain a tboroughly English gentleman. As he eucceeds in doing so he will assuredly succeed iu commanding the respect and regard of every native around him. All our power in India rests on this. We may lay it down as an absolute certainty that the millions of natives which a handful of Englishmengovern in thin vast continent will not consent to be governed by a handful of their equals. Our power consists in our being essentially diflerent trom them, and in their belief in our moral superi ority only. The only thing which can endanger the existence of this power is the destruction or weakening of that belief. " The state of the body will often affect the mind; habits and manners will aot on and be reacted on by morals and religion. " Let us, then, be English in all things, to the utmost of our povwer, internally and externally, in religion and In morals, in habits and in feelings, allovjng absolute freedom of opinion and fair play to all men, and all will be well. " The second evil is notorious, it has been frequently re marked on, its existence is everywhere acknowledged, and its effecots are lamentable. The commanding officer of a regiment in the Bengal army is almost powerless for good, he is allowed to do nothing, his men are almost taught to despiso bim, and in many instances of late years the Sepoys have been allowed and encouraged to forward written complaints aganst their commanders direct to army head-quarters. Wh.at can be worse than this? It is utterly destructive of all military discipline and soldierlike pride. " The third and fourth mentioned evils are closely connected with the second. In the Bengal army the practice prevails of each commander of a company drAwing pay for that company himself separately, direct from the divisional paymaster; so that the pecuniary transactions of the regiment are carried on in a great measure independently of the commanding officer, and often without his knowledge, as, for example, has appeared in somelAte disolosures regarding banking transactions, wherein the officers commanding companies appear to have made arrangements with divisional paymasters for the recovery by regular instalments of payments on account of various banking transaotions, without the commanding officers of the regiments knowing anything of the matter. All these also tend to reduce the useful power of regimental commandants and make them be despised. " With regard to messes the state of affairs is very bad. In some regimenta no mess exists,; the maintaining a mess is not only not made compulsory, hut ever. where a mess is maintained it is optional with offioers whether to belong to it ornot; such atAteof affairsi fraught with the worst consequences; it breaks a regimernt up mnto seprsanties, d poives rLoe to alu manner of iiitfeelig. IA aloo leus the extraordnay degr It takes away much of the gupm hich a commaner quietly and impereeptibly receives from nll well-disposed officers, who have a proper pride in their noble profession; and it enables others who may be illdisposed to ork mischief d perosived, till its effeoba become apparent in the bad state of the regiment.* oThemremedy for all thee evilshsinthe hands of the Commander.in-Chfef and of Government; let the commander of a regiment be systematically and effectuaZly supported in the exercise of his legitimate powers; lot those powers be as ample as possible in evry respeet; regarding regimental affairs, let all turn, centre, and rest on him; and with these full powers make him responsible that ali yoes welL If it do not, displace bim from his command. Let there be a regimental paymaster so whom the eomany officers send their muster rols, and whose duty it Is to draw the pay of the regiment, under the authority of the no.- menial commander. " Let the mess be a publio Institution, to belong to which is oempulsory on all officers. Let the commanding offi. cers be held responsible that it be conduohd with due and proper regard to economy, oomfort, and propriety, and give them full power to enforoe such a state of things There is nothing new in these rule,; they exist with the happiest Offets ia the other armies of India, and ould be equaxy advantageous to that of Bengal. "'The fifth evil ix notorious, and is plinly preved by men dees4g their officers in the field, by feque&at iaUtiaiee, k., whare aething has b.eal known by the effeer ef wrhat was goirg en luntil it reKilte in opsa reea e to Mitlerity. The caue ef this are vaiu,par depee Au 051Wht ha b hea men iead above, hieett y Ca Yi abesInable sytem of reogairigeat in our ras, ald on tbe absurd system of promotion, whereby the native offlcers are absolutely useless. t The remedies are, of course, as described with respoct to those causes, "The sixth evil is of a very grave and important nature. The effect of enlisting men of a certain caste, or creed to I he exclusion of others in the Indian army, Is to subject that armv to the control, not of the Government and the Articles of War, but to that of Brahmins and Goseins, MooDabs and Fukheers. By this system, a man is not to be chosea on account of his fitness to bo & soldier, his willingness and strengtb, docility and courage, but because he is a twice bm nworshipper of Vishnoo. Whatever his other qualifi. cations, if a man think that a stone with a patch of red paint on it is not to be worshipped as the Creator, still mote if bo have been a shoemaker, &c., he is not to be admitted into the ranks of the Bengal army, for fear of offending the l7.y and insolent Brahmins. The consequences are ruinous to discipline. By reason of this a native soldier in Bengal is far more afraid of an offence against caste than of an offenoe against the Articles of War, and by this neans a di gree of power retts with the private soldier which is entirely incompatible with all healthy rule. " Treachery, mnutiny, viliany of all kinds, may be carried on among the private soldiers, unknown to their officers, to any extent, where the men are of one caste of Hindoos, and where the rules of caste are more regarded than those ,f military discipline. To such an extent does this evil exist that I bave known a Bengal commanding officer express his regret at being compelled to disch e an exceUetmt Sapoy because the other men had discovered him to be of inferior caste, and had demanded his dismissaL To a Bombay officer such a state of firs appears incredible; it amonnts to open mutiny; hut it i the normal state of the Bengal army at present. It is curious that, though the Bengal Sepoys have contrived to have it believed that their religion is concerned in this business of caste, In our ranks nothing is further from the truth. In conjunction with the system of promotion which prevails this attention to caste keeps all real power in the hands of the private soldiers; and, as they think, saves them from much trouble and annoyance; but vihen they assert that this evil is a neoessary consequence of their religion the Bengal Sepoys state the contrary to truth. "This is positively proved by that which takes place in the army of Bombay, wherein hundreds and thousands of men from Hindostan, from the same villages, of the same caste, and even of the same families, brothers by the same fathers and mothers as the fine gentlemenr ef the Bengal army, are seen in the ranks, shoulder to shoulder, nay, even sleeping in the same tent with the I[Ahratta, the Dher, ancd the Purwarres, without scruple or thought of objection. The one prides himself on being a Hindoo, the other on. being a soldier. Which pride is the beat for our purpeos? This system of regarding caste is the original cause of many other evils in the Bengl army; and much of what has been said regarding the adoption of Asiatio mannors tells again heavily here,* The Bomlay Sepoy, wbatever faults he may have, is one great excellence, which is, that he looks on the Euroean soldier as his model in all things pertaining to soldiership, and endeavours to imitate bim. Like the European soldier, the Native Sepoy of Bombay will turn his hand to any labour which he may be ordered to execute, a If the lines require cleaning, &c., a working party of Sepoys is ordered out as a matter of course, with pickaxe and powrah, and the work is well done. The teehnical term 'Working party' is as familiar in the mouth of a Bombay Sepoy as' shoulder arms.' Nay, I have known more than once the men of a Bombay regiment to volunteer for such work as building their officers' houses, mess-room, &c., andlto do the wort well, too-making the bricks, mixing tho mu , &;., entirely by themselves. This would not be credited by the greater Dart of the Bengal army, and to such a state of helplessness 'has the recogmtlon of caste in the ianks brought the Bengal Sepoy that a regiment of native cavalry, as I have repeatedly witnessed, is unable to picket, unsaddle, or groom its horses until the arrival of Its syces an d grassoutters, sometimes, as I have seen, for several hours after the arrival of the regiment at its ground. In a Bornbay regiment, beforethat time had elapsed, the horses would bave been picketed, groomed, fed, and watered, stables would have been over, the tents pitched, and the men have had their breakfast. To such an incredible extent has this helplessness been carried and recognized by authority that a Bengal sentry cannot think of striking the gong at his own quarter-guard, and men called ' Gunta Pandays' re aotually maintained and paid for by Government, to do this duty for them. It is the khbasamaun, kitmutgar, hookab-burdar, &c., over again. The remedy is obvious * never allow any reference to caste when enlisng men. if others nov in the service object, let them be told that Government does not care one Vin whether its Sepoys be Hindoos, or Mussulmans, or Brahmins, or Purwarees, so long as they be good soldiers, and that if they do not like the rules of the service they may leave it. If they still object, or make any difficulty about the matter, discharge them on the spot. There are millions of better men ready to oocupy their places. Iet also the use of intrenching tools be part of the drill of the Sepoy, as much as is the musket exercise, and when he has learnt this let him be occasionally employed in working parties, &e,, to prevent his forgetting it again. This trifle would be fonud to possess muckx more importance than at first sight appears to attach to it, ' The seventh evil, the ad system of promotion, is the worst of all; Its effects are crushingly rainous. In the Bengal army the promotion of natives is made to depend on senlority only, so that if a man keep clear of actual crime, and lives long enough, he must becomo a commissioned officer, however unfit for the offloe. " Under this system, the private soldier feels himself entirely independent of his officers; he knows that they neither hasten nor retard his advance in the service. He has nothing to do but to live and get through his duties with listless stupidity, and vith the least possible trouble to himself. No exertion on his part can help him,-no talent, courage, fidelit, nor good conduct isof any avail. Confidence and pridelin each other between men and officers cannot exist. There is no real co-operation; for, the one being powerless to aid, the other becomes careless of offending, o is ine en,v onam, privae Soldler. J:rxe system is equaaly, if not more baneful as respts the native officers, commissioned and noncommissioned. The whole of the native commissioned officers are entirely useless, the amount of their pay is a dead loss to the State, every one of them is unfit for service by reason of imbecility produced by old age, or where in rare instanoes the man may not be altogethler in his second childhood he is entirely useless from having been educated ixn a bad school. All should have been pensioned long ago; but, alas, if the present system of promotion be continued, the getting rid of these poor old gentlemen, who cutsuchpanfully ridiculous figures in the Bengal lBeg ments, would be of no use whatever, for the non-commissioned officers who would have to be promoted in their places are but little better; even the very naiques (corporals) are almost teo old for servlce, How very different is the state of affairs under a proper syst em. of promotion Aby merit Sl.oue I " It gives the commanding officers of regiments and companies a good deal more trouble oertainly iun making promotions; but how are they repaid? If they really and honestlydo their best to choose the men for promotion without partiality, favour, or affeotion, but by merit and fitness alone, it is soon found that every man in the regiment (at least all who are fit to be in our ranks) exerts himself to aid his officers. A degree of vigour and activity amounting to a new life is infused into every part of the regiment. The men, seeing al the pries of the service witin their reach, exert themselves to obtain them. They can only obtain their end by becoming good soldiers, by learning their duty, and performing it to the satisfaction of their superiors. "The native officers, being ohosen with regard alone to their qualifications and their fitness to hold commissions, are aliko proud of the distinction they have acquired bytheir appointments, and able to perform their duties. They are not enfeebled by age, aud the consclousness that their respectability and success in life depend on their own conduct makes them exert themselves willingly and zealously in maintaining the discipline and reputation of the service in which they acquire honour. The ill effeots of the one system and the excellencies of the other appear to me so8 elf-evident and have been both proved on so large a scale that I should consider it'to be insulting to the understanding of my readers were I to enla-ge on It. " With such a system of promotion, thegood and the bad, the clever and the foolish, the brave and the timid, the energetic and the imbecile, are nearly on a par. The officers are powerless for good, and the men, keeping just clear of open violence, have their own way in all things. It is astonishing, and says much for the goodness of the raw material of the Bengal army, that under such arrangements the whole fabric has not entirely fallen to pieces. The thing is rotten throughout, and discIpline there is none; but it Is wonderful that even the outward semblance ef an army has been still maintained under such deplorable mismanagement, " The eighth evil, the want of dipline, is the necessary consequence of much that has already been described. In speaking of want of discipline I do not only mean that wbich is shown by serious mutinies and misconduct on extraordinary occasions, but also as evinced in the ordinary every-day routine of duty in the Bengal army: this is such as to be almost incredible to an officer of the Royal army, or of the other armies of India, The first tbimg done by a Bengal Sepoy w^hen he montbs guard is to strip himself of arms accoutrements, and clothing; the muskets are piled, and a sentry ms posted, who remalI generally (not always) properly acooutred, &c.; all the others, including nonscommissioned officers, disarm and strip; if there be anywater near they go and dabble in it afer the fasion of al Hindostnees, otherwise they cover theselve with sheets and g to sleep, quite naked, with the exceptlon of a lungeatee, When the sentry thirks that he has been on long enough he bawls out for some one to relieve hima; afer a whle up gBete A Sepoy from beneath his sheet. and after a few yawns and stretches puts on his clothes and sacoutrements, but does not tke his musket; that would be too much trouble And endanger upsetting the whole pile; he then goes to the sentry, takes his musket from him, and ooccpies his place ; away goes tho relieved ma and stipe like the others. No naique attends with the relef; he remains fast asleep under his sheet. Now, this state of things I have myself seen in hundreds of cass. It is so astonishing to a Bombay officer that he cannot help remarking on it; yet I have been assred by numerous Bengal that this is the! way ef YpountIngguard. It bould be borne in ramr, atlio, that m tae gal army four men re allowed to a sentry, instead of three as with the other amies, so that a Sepoy with them is on sentry only six hours altogether duri his tour of 24 hours, instead of ogiht, as usuaL " But it is by no ncans uncommon in the Bemprl army to relieve a gusrd onoe a-week, and even at longer intervals, when the state of affairs xbove mentioned must take place evn if it wree not o en other occasions. This was th ase when the Bombay and Begagl rp met at Peeha-wr, and oonsiderble grumbling and omplaining took pl when Sir H. Dundas inisted on the guards being relevod daily-. To the mind of an practisal soldier so further proof ix nmes ryon et mubject-want of disAipline, He must at once see thab where guards we relleved weekly, where the sn. tWes reliev eamh other as they plea", and where the wkole guard stripg naked there can be no discipline whatever. It is uzeless to ask whether a rn can read and write when you find that he does not know a letter of his alphabet. If t were necessry, however, I could adduce abundance of other facts to the sie purport. The remedy is a p parent from what hs been said before. Sach are some of the reforms peculiarly required by Bengal. Bat there are many others, equally requisite, with regard to the native Indian army generally; for instances, with respect to the regimental o derly room. "Tlhe commanding officer of every regiment should, every day of his life, hold his orderly room in some convenient public place, where the commanding officer, his staff, and all the European officers tot otherwise engaged should assemble. Here aU regimental business should be zransacted in public; every man in the regiment should have an opportunity every day of seeing his oommanding officer. *- Everything being done with perfect openness In the presence of all the English officers, many common sources of discontent and of grievAnce, resl or imaginary, would be removed. Every officer would be habitually well acquainted with everything relating to the regiment., and would be nDdergoing a course of edacation calculated better than any other to fit him for command in his turn. c" While the habitual daily presence of all the English cflicers around their commanding officer would afford him the best possible 3upport in doing right, and impose the most effective check on wrong, a very ordinary mortal night, under such an arrangement, be safely trusted with atsolate powers, while no officer's qtUalifictions could ever be for a moment doubtfuL Where everthing is open to tl e public, common sense has the fairest chance of prevailing. arsd ' regulation' need be but little intruded. "Officers need be troubled as little as possible with form, dress, ceremony, and matters of etiquette at their daily orderly room, and tho inconvenience of daily attendAnce would speedUly be overcome by an increasing feoling of intere,t in all regimental affairs, and all irksomer ess would be removed by the grant of leave of absence when required for any rational purpose. |" The arrangement here contemplated appears to me to be of the very highest importnce to the welfare of the native aymy of India; and I may observe that I have myself practiEed what I here teachl for 15 years together nwit the p, piest ef£ects. *' will now conclude with a few observations on the late order concerning passnag In the native languages, by which, with the best possible intentions, oar honourable masters have done such an amount of iwnustice to their servants that if the order be rally and strictly carried into effect the gretetst injury to the army and to our Indian empire must "In the firat place, the Honourable Cout of Directors proclaim thaLt the only nost in their service for which a knowledge of the native lnguages is not a necessary qulification is the command of their regular native soldiers : officers who do not pass are to remain with tbeir regiments. Secondly. An officer, by natural talent and study, may be a first-rate engineer, or peradventure an astronomer, but rature may have denied him the peculiar talent of acquiring language, and he has In consequence neither passed in Hin. dostanee, Mahratta, nor Persian. Government requires an engineer or an astronomer; by the order of the Han. Court they must appoint, not the man who is well acquainted | with astronomy and physica scienoe, but some one whose leisure has been occupied, and whose mind baa been Im! proved, by the study of the indecent and obscene stories and of the childish fables of which the Hindustanee literature ccnssts, eut who knows not a vernier from a mural quadrant, nor Jupiter from Venus. Nature has given us aU even the best of us, but very limited facultis; some excel in one respect, some in another, each may do excellently 'well if placed in that position for which his natau talents and abilities are sited; but to attempt to force all men to be linguists is no more reasonable than to compel them to be all of one size of body; what between stretching and compressing, the whole human race might be destroyed, but no uniformity of size would be produced. It Is quite a unreasonable to say that a man is unfit for staff employ because h has not the gift of tongues as it would be to gay so because he was no musician; a want of an organ of langouge is probably quite as common as the defect of the organ of tune. But does either deficiency imply that the man is fit to command the native infantry soldiers of the Indian army and fit for ] nothing else? Ha any Government on earth such an amount of talent at its dispowal that it can afford to press all into one mould without fatal injury to efficienc v "I have served my hon. masters long, and at least zealously. They have told me that I have done them good service, and they have given me high praise. I have a ever been absent from my duty, and have always performed it to the full satisfaction of my superiors. I am tolerably acquainted with the natives of India, in intimate association with whom I have paseed the best part of my lift. But, on the other hand, I have not passed in anv language and cannot read even the Bsgh-o-Bahar. Wherefore, I am virtually told by my hon. masters that as I have been so long in their servioe they will not now positively turn me out, as incapable, from the place I have held with so much undeserved pralso from them during the last 10 years; but my lientenantg, who have hitherto, I flatter myself, held me in some considerable respect and esteem, and whom I have endeavonred to confirm in what seem to me to be soldierlike idesa, are now told that to prevent my bad example affecting them, to prevent their becoming such an imbecile as their comcaander, in spite of his thinking them the best men in the army to be his lieutenants, and his never having had a fault to find with one of them, and In spite of all their zealous and gallant services, and their honourable wounds, they are now told, I say,they shaUall be turned out of their appoimtments ff they do not immediately pss an examinatlon in the Hindostanee language. That in to say that seven years' bonest and zealous exertion, and brilliant service in the field, including a most honourable share in hard fought and important battles and tseges, with frequent cormendation in public despatches, &cc, altogether impls', in the nutrobeac ¢oltc to tns t shtudy of filthy Hindostaniee stories. " let the Hon. Court at once rescind an order which will defeat the object contemplated ,in it, which has dl3sgusted or will disgust many of their best, most tried, and most valued servants; which will make contempt and ill-feeling take the place of honest pride and generous zeal ; and which cannot but deeply injure their army and India in generaL. "I have had abundant opportunity of judging of this matter, and I solemnly assure my hono-urble masters that it is notorious that their offioors who have passed in the language are not only not the most able of their servants, but that they have as a body (there are brilliant exceptions of couse) less knowledge of that language for practical purposes than the unpassed; that is if lnguage be intended to faciltate the communication of ideas between man and man, and not for concealing thoughts. This mayappear par doxical, but a little consideration soon shows that itmustbo so. While the young man has been studying ooks, the other hasbeen studyingrmen. I have onhundredsofOCasODsseen a youthful genius who had passed In the language, entirely at a loss to understand the expressions used by a common peasant, and qite incapable of malntaining a conversation with him, while one of the unpased who could not reada word in a Hindostanee book but had been accustomed to associate with the people, would talk with the man with perfect fluency. A knowledgeof the peopleofIndia, of their thought, habits, feelings, beliefs desires, want, &c, is learnt, not from Hindoshnee books, but from intercourse with the people themselves. And my honounrable masters may well believe me, when I tell them that such knowledge is of far more importance to their service and to India than the most Intimate acquaintance wi#h all the Eindostanee books ever written, " Another subject of vital importance to India, not only to the army, but to all the services, and to the whole people of the country, natives as wel as Europeans, is the furlough regulations. "The existing rules are not adapted to the present state of things, they belong to days long gone by, when a period of twelve months or more was necessary to receive from England an answer to a letter from Bombay. "IMoreover, the present rules regarding leave of abeence are exceasvely unfair In another respeot. Their tendency in every way is to favour the least valuable servants of Government-those who are continnally suffering from real or niainary sickness, and on that account oontinually absent from their duty. " It is an undoubted physiological fact, that hard workiag, energetio men, rho continually exercise themselves In nodily and mental occupation, suffer the least from ill heal . They have no time to be sick. Authorities are agreed on this point. For example, Copland (Ale"4 Led., pag D2) says :- "av, When the mental energies are depresead by grief, anxiety, disappointment, fear, &c, the powers oE life are less able to oppose the debilitating causes of disease which invade them from without, and of which nature all the exciting causes of fevers, particularly those which, al e specific or contagious and miasmal, generally partake in a most marked manner. On the other hand, when the mind is elevated by success, by hope, by confidence, and the other exciting passions, the depressing causes mak-e little or no impression upon the constitution, and individuals thus circumstanced almost always escape from diseases. which reaiditly invade the Searl, the dejected, and the disap. "Again, Copland, Mfed. Dd,, p. 920, paragraph 11$; 'Confidenc, continued mental occupaton, and moderate exctement, are especiall effic&ious in redsting the cAuses of most fevers. There is o mral courae sometimes ponaed by persons, the Wakest perhaps in respect t physical power, that enables them to rest infectious andepidemic influenoe more sucOefinly than the most robust, who are not thus mentally endewed.' "On the other hand, it is certain that a large portion of the sickness which causes so many offlcers to be xbsent from their duty ka Indai is produced by feebleness of character, by idlenes3 laziness, listlessnes, or languor. "Sow, I would not for a moment 'wish to lessen the Indulpenceie gnted by a beneficent Government to such of itS faitul servants as might have the miniortune to be suffering from ll health. I would leave the rules regarding leave of absence on sick certicat as they are, but asaredly i would so arder matters that long -ontinued, honest, unremitting, and valuable labonr should be deemed to consitute at leaxt as good a title to the hfvur of a furlough to 13ng. land as the want of health alose. "Moreover, if such furlough were obtanable at moderate interas, and with greter faclities than at presant the nuimber of sick certificates would assredly be imiensaly "It is probable that afte a while they would almost whe1 disappear. "2The evil done, both to Enland and to Inda, by tfh. present furlough regulations, is incaleulable. "A large proportion of the Indian effloi 'who eon now return to England is oompozd of thoo worn eot in the service--f the aed, the feeble, ihe Askly, tho disoontbated theidle, and the lay; while te eer the avemided, the able, the zeaouos, bnd the strenz, are complled ter the no i par to remahn at their w.erk Ial iwhbo~ ay intemioin, without a dy of reel rest, ustl hsr fal. ing vigeer qualify them ala. for te la&ulaaoe of a -fiat to Msedr native land.

They are ver7 rarely seen in England. " From this cans it proceed h hat ia the Imgnation of the people of Ecgland the idea of an Indian officer, military or civil, is always connected with those of rice and curry, and diseased livers. From this cause ohiefly results the deplorable ignorAnoe regarding Indian affairs which prevails even among educated gentlefolk in England. " How easily might all thece evils be rectified. o Let us have recourse to a principle as old as tho history of man-the institution of tho Sabbath. This at ones satis. es all our wants aud meets every difeculty in every single point, while no objection wvhatever can be brought against it sate by those vvno would wish, if possible, still to retain a dark veil between India and Eng1rnd for their own suppo6ed private advantage, bat to the grievous injury of bothk My proposal is to give every officer, ivil or militry, every seventh year to himself, if he wished to avail himself of the indulgence, to allow him, during that period, to go v herever it might please him to go, whether in India or any other part of the world, to allow him during that year to receive his full Indian allowances, to retain his staffappointment if he held one, but during his absence not to recoive the staff salary, which should go to the officer who might officiate until his return. If an officer should wish to remain in India, even in the very camp in which he was serving, and there to enjoy his sabbathical year, he should be allowed to do so. The year should be his own to employ as he pleased. I If an officer chose to allow his sabbath to pua by, and to wait tili he had served 12 years, he should be allowed two years, rest on furlough- after 18 years' uninterrupted work three years should be ;Aowed, and so on ' The consequences of this arrangement would be great and numerous, and aU of them good-good for the Governcent, good for the people, and good for the services. The amount of vigour infused into Indian society by this means would be almost incredible. Hops, looking forwaid to the enjoyment of the sabbath, would stimulate even the lazy and the idle to work bard during the s8 yea of lab,ar. " The continual return to England and reflux into Iudia of the tide of Europeans would be to the body moral and politic exactly what the circulation of the blood is to the animal body England would be our lungs, the old blood would be there adrated, and new life, helth, and strength thereby sent flowing vigorouly io every corner and extremity of our empire, Energy and lealtit woul everywhere take the place of languor and disease. |" The outcry for more Eurpns would be at an end, for those nowr in the service would be found willing and able cheerulUy to do well double the amount of work which is now thought to tax their powers too highl. " There would be a far more equal distribution of the emoluments of staff appointments by reason of tho number of officiating men. There would also be a far greater number of men weU acquainted writh and ready efficiently to perform the duties of such appointments, to the great advantage of the service, which now often suffers from the nexperience of new incumbents. " Socety in the two countriec would become one, and all mxanner of blessings would indirectly followr. '"Let any man of sound common sense and a tolerable knowledge of the subject think over the matter, and he mut be convinoed at once oE the truth df the conclusions set forth above. "The doctrine is founded on the laws of nature, and It3 truth will be the more apparent the more those laws are studid. "JOHN JACOB."

COMMISSIONS IN THE A-RJY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I cannot help suspecting that there must bo some error In the wording of the memorandum recently Issued by command of his Royal Highness the Co-rnnder-in. Chief, which offers any gentleman who can raise 100 men n commision in the army. In war time we know, from reoent experience, that it is by no means easy, under our present system, to fill the vac&nOes which occur in the ranks of our offioers. We know too that it has been proved to boe impossible, under our present system, to fill them with properly trained and instructof reruits. Major-General Lord West hs told the Purchase Commissloners (Q. 2,516), that the young officers supplied to him from the depOts at home when his regiment ws before Sebatopol, arrived there utterly incapable of discharging the commonegt daties of their profession. He declared that he wM compelled to intrust his men to the leading of lads who knew no more of soldiering than if they had beea so many civilians. And Major-General Sir Charleg Yorke, then militaxy secretary to Lord Hardinge, informed the Commisioner3 that towards the end of the Russian War, our cavalry regi. ments-the fayourite and most aristocratic arm in peace tiim-remained nenoeearilyiucomplvte, nobody being willing to accept commnisions in them on any terms. (Q. 98). His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chiof now offers comrns-ions to such influentil and wealthy persoons as shal be able to raise 100 reeruita. But the elae to which hl Royal Highneo holds out tbhs boon mre precisely the eaaaex who eon obtan oomamisdns with the greatest ea withot raisng a single man. Few s 0lMes or county rrembem -supposing them anxioUs to seud their sos to the ruoue kim India at the present crLss-would find much diffloulty la obtaining enigncies or cormetoise for them without pur. chae; and if they had topayfor them, it would be far eheaper to pay 450L than to Incur the trouble, egk, and expense of raising 100 men-in competitien with numerous recruiting parties and a high bounty. It is just posible that It may be intended to offe a cptWin's commisaion to a person raidng 100 men, aud that the authoritits at the Horse Guards have, as oecaionaljy happens, failed in expraulng lucidly their intenion. If so, what bocomes of the recommendations ee'eyed is. Me firgt report of the Counil of Military Edutatioz, of which the ink is saroely dry? Are the captains, lUteSate* and uslgns of the companies thua rabsd, if an ace evw o raised, to enter the ser*nve Cheier terms thia the preeibed to the rest of the aervie by Ganscl Cnme sad Colonels Addaion and Pertlok 9 A CITIIAIN.

LONDON, SATUBDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1857. _-- - -- b As it was never imagined that India was to be governed precisely as wve govern ourselves, so it was never supposed that the Press stood on the same ground there as at home. The liberty of the Press has in tllis country been exalted to the rank of a sacred principle, the Palladium of the Constitution, an inherited right, the safeguard of personal freedom, and the only check upon political tyranny and official abuse. These are indefinite and absolute expressions, btut thoy who employ them have an honest and wholesome conviction that a free Press is necessary to a free State, and that there is something intrinsically honourable and beneficial in a state of society in which everybody may publish, within reasonable limits, his belief and his opinions. The freedom of the Press is, however, a practical question. We maintain it on such practical and assignable grounds as that it throws continual light on the administration of public affairs, on the proceedin)gs of official personages, and the working of the whole system ; that it gives a vent to fvelings which might otherwise snoulder in a more malignant form; that, on the other hand, it provides a check for its own excesses in the constant opportunity of reply and contradiction, and the disgust which oalumny and falsehood will always excite in the aminds of a free and generous people. Such a defence is true as far as it applies to such a State and such a people. We believe that, in matter of fact, it is impossible for the Press of this country to do any amount of mischief at all to be oompared with the evils certain to ensue on a withdrawal of this check. The Prews cannot damage a good measure; it cannot overthrow a good Government; it cannot destroy a well. grounded reputation. The least symptom of a malicious design to attain these ends is certain to recoil on the authors. These things it cannot do, taough they are quite within the ordinary scope cj p3lic men, and are the frequent airns of pies aud politicians. The public at large are far more ready to accept the rhetorical exaggerations of some enthusiast or partisan on a platform, of some adventurer or rival in the Senate, than of the nameless writer who site down to a dispassionate discussion of persons and thinga. The " we" to 'Which some alarmists have attached so tremendous an influence, and which it bax been proposed to rob of its dark terrors and clothe with some vulgar impersonation, is, perhaps, the most cautious and scrupulous writer of the day. In the absence of a great name the pen is found to appeal to facbt and considerations witii,i everybody's knowledge and reach, and to go no further than the public is prepared to go with it. Onoe it tranagresses, once it aims to be an independent authority and an organ of mischief, it findx everybody's hand turaed against it, aud it ha to defend its ground against a thousand writers and talkers only too glad to find a common butt for their invective. For the truth of these remarks on the real impotence of a free Press in a free country for any evil purpose we need only refer to the fact that none use it so freely as they who in moments of petulance have thought fit to denounce it. It is a matter of frequent occurrence for men who but the other day were abusing the newspapers, and putting anonymous writing on a par with assassination, to make the freeest use of these or other coluins, and, as often as not, find by their own experience that it is no easy matter so to write as to incur neither contradiction nor rebuke. These are practical considerations, and they apply to England, but not to India. Though our government of that country is infinitely more conducive to happiniess, freedom, and elevation than any government that its former rulers or the people themselves ever devised, yet it cannot be called self-government or constitutional in the same ense as ours. In fact, India caunot govern itself; it never did ; and the first step in the attempt would be a war of extermination between Mahomedan and Hindoo, then between the different sects of the former creed. So we govern India, and impartial authorities have said there is no country in the world so well governed as India, and that England herself cannot exhibit such proofs of government at home as can be shown in her great dependency. We are tho lords of India, and hold the balance of power between innumerable races, religions, dynasties, laws, and pretensions of all sorts. Tn doing this we have to appeal to the gratitude, the fear, and respect of two hundred millions of people, who are, perhaps, the dimplest and most credulous on the face of the earth. It is the very soil of *u. The religion of the vast majority is not merely an ancient mythology, bolieved because it is there, but a living source of the most preposterous inventions. Indeed, there is hardly anything that the Hindoos may not be made to believe. They will accept with equal facility, on any or no authority, and without the least investigation, a tale of private scandal, a libel upon a Government, an astounding miracle, a new revelation, the deification of a plant, a* stream, or a stone, a prophecy, the decline of a dynasty or the decay of a godhead, a curse, a code of morality, or anything whatever, so long as the appeal is made directly to the faith, and reason be carefully put out of the question. All that is spontaneous in the social system of the Hindoos is of the most imaginative and irrational character. From the highest Rajah to the lowest mendicant they yield their faith, their conscience, their purse, and their lives to the leader who makes the most extravagant demands upon them. Accordingly for themselves, and among themselves, they altogether eschew freedom of discussion. As for the Mahomedans, they know no such thing as liberty, and can have as little to do with a free Press as with a House of Commons. In such a population, then, there are wanting those checks which 'we have admitted to be necessary, and which we have asserted in ouI' own instance. Our direct hold upon India is our military system, and the chief material of that system is a native soldiery. As it is the most powerful part of the people, so it is the most informed, the most gregarious, the least occupied, and the most liable to have a stock of grievances against us. If it is assured by designing persons in a tone of authority that we are planning to destroy caste by the secret use of forbidden materials ; that we are preparing to take the Sepoy to the ends of the earmn ; Or Mar, tins 1,, tin -rpl - ,. expulsion, it will most probably believe what it is told. It may never see the contradiction or may not credit it. At all events, it is not competent to detect the imposture, and consequently has not the requisite safeguard against the abuses of a free Press. Such are the considerations that have determined-indeed, we may say compelled, the Indian Govermment to restrict for the present the liberty of the Press. It does not by any means give up the principle, and it expressly reserves the grounds upon which a free Press was given to India, now twenty-two years ago. That Act was avowedly an experiment, or temporary concession, made with the full consciousness that it might be abused, and that circumstances might arise to compel its suspension. The present Act of Council, therefore, is, happily, not retrogressive, and merely implies that an occasion has come such as was contemplated by the authors of the Act of 1833. When it is found that the native journals published in Hindcstanee and Persian contain, besides the incendiary proclamation known to our readers, the most lavish abuse of the Government and its agents, promises of immediate emancipation, and directions to the native army how to further that object, it becomes a matter of common sense and obvious necessit.y to prevent the Press from being the organ of r ebellion. That is all that is intended. The only difficulty of the question is its bearing on the Anglo-Indian Press. To the home imagination there is a certain necessary connexion between the English language and liberty of speech. But everywhere and in every native regiment there are Sepoys who read English, schools where English is taught, and native officials quite ready and competent to translate sedition into any Indian language that may answer the purpose. In faet, there are two journals at Calcutta published and edited by natives in the English languaL;e, and these journals have contributed their share to the insurrection. Practically it matters little, or nothing, whether dangerous arguiments, treasonable counsels, and useful information are given in English or in any native tongue, or whether the publishers be English or Indian. In the present critical situation of the Indian Government it must take a plain, not to say a military view of the question, and silenco not only the mutineer in arms, but the writer who blows the blast of war. The Indian Government have carried out the present measure with great moderation. It would be mere pedantry, then, to ascribe to it a settled design on the Press, or on those principles of liberty which we aU cherish at homne. What course it may have to take for the future is a matter for further consideration.
We republish this morning a document which, under any creumstances, would be deerving of public attention, but which recent occurrences bave invested with singular Interest. It contains the views of Brigadier-General JAcoB,-better known, perhaps, as Colonel JoHN JACOB, of the Scinde HorBe,-upon the constitution and discipline of the Bengal Army, and a sketch of the reforms which, in his opinion, were required to impart a more desirable character to that force. It must be understood that the remarks in question were penned st;me time ago, and it will, of course, be seen that the evil has now exceeded the scope of ordinary trk atment ; but the opinions of such an authority still powses great value both in explanation of the past and instruction for the future. Two points will strike the reader as not a little remarkable-lirst, that Colonel JacoB, while probing to the bottom every defect in the Bengal Army, omits ail allusion to the withdrawal of officers frorn tht.ir regiments on Staff or political employment; and, secondly, that he actually ascribes to the officers as a body many of those Asiatic habits which in the present day they were presumed to have lost, and which one of our crrespondents so ably justified them for discarding. It would, indeed, be unfortunate if Europeans I in the Bengal service adapted themselves to the ways of Hindostan in those respects exclu- sively where the assimilation could be productive I of nothing but detriment, and we may hope that the defects alluded to were always partial, and did not prove permanent. As regards the abstraction of officers from their regiments-a subject on which there can be little doubt either as a ques- tion of fact or a question of expediency, it is pos-! sible that Colonel JACOB may have been less struck ! with proceedings which were common to his own service also. As a Bombay officer, he contrasts I with hiis own experience whatever is peculiar to Bengal, but overlooks, perhaps, arrangements which, though manifestly objectionable in themselves, were not more disadvantageous to one army than the other. The substance of the document, as might be expected, tends rather to the confirmatioll or opinions already prevailing than to the introduction of any new theory. Eight seriou defects are specified as damaging the efficiency of the Bengal, Army, five of which relate to the position of the officers, two to the character of the soldier, and one to the very comprehensive result of the whole. Besidesthe Orientalism of tone above noticed, Color ! JAeooz --epoaking, no doubt, with the peculipx S(. tiveness natural, on such a point, to a Comma:' of Irregulars-deplores and conldemns f' - CIrU ment of the authority which shoul' : 'dged with regimental commanders, the wal t ot cordiality and X frate-nity which should exist among the officers them±eives, and the " entire absence of a proper " confide,ce?' between these officers and the native troops. This last remark may appear somewhat strange after the striking examples we have recently seen of the trust which was almosb ! invariably placed by European officers in the loyalty of the Sepoys up to the very moment of mutiny; but, when Colonel JAcoB proceeds to explain himself, his observation is found to point only to the very facts which we are at this moment witnessing. There is confidence enough in the case, but it is not a " proper" confidence, not a confidence that is well grounded or justified upon trial. Officers in the field imagine that they are followed by their men, and suddenly find themselves unsupported-examples of which desertion occurred more than once in the Sikh campaigns. They know nothing of mutinies hatching under their very eyes, and believe in the fidelity of their troops until they find them in open rebellion against authority. This is precisely what has happened now, though on such a scale and with such characteristics as probably Colonel JAcoB in his most desponding mood never dreamt of anticipating. It is in the description, however, of the Bengal Sepoy that the document before us is most instructive, and after perusing it we can only wonder, as the author himself did, how " even the " outward semblance of an army" could ever have been maintained while such customs prevailed. Everything in the Bengal Army turned upon caste. High-caste men almost exclusively were enlisted, and they were permitted to set their caste and its requirements above every consideration of discipline or duty. The " lazy and insolent Brahmins" who filled the ranks of the army refused to dig, to build, or to perform any one of the thousand services as needful in a campaign as fighting itself. A regiment of cavalry on arriving at its halting-ground would decline to picket, unsaddle, or groom its own horses, and would wait for hours in conceited indolence till servants of subordinate caste came to do the work for them. Another story told of these fanatical coxcombs is so outrageous, that it reads like one of the best American exaggerations. At the quarter-guard of a battalion on duty is kept a gong, which is struck for signals according to regulations, but a Bengal sentry would not demean himself by touching the instrument at his very elbow, and the gongs were sounded by men kept and paid for the purpose ! But this part of the tale has hitherto been only half told. Colonel JACOB admits us to a view of the case which places the point in a light far more significant than before. Assuming that a Hindoo has imbibed all these conceits so thoroughly that they have become inherent elements of his very system, it of course follows that if we engage the services of high-caste natives we must do so with the necessary obligations, and take the men with their drawbacks as weU as with their recomnnendations. Colonel JACOB, however, expresly tels us, and upon authority which no one can impeach, that this assumption is utterly unfounded, and that the incredible pretensions of the Bengal Sepoy are based, not upon the inexorable precepts of his religion, but simply upon his own subtle and designing policy. These men can forget their caste when they please to do so, and are glad enough, indeed, to put it out of the way when they see that it brings disparagement rather than indulgence. In the Bombay Army such pretensions are never heard of, whereas there is no doubt about the identity of the two cases. In that army, says Colonel JACOB, " hundreds and thousands of men "fiom Hiindosian, fronm the saine villages, of the "same caste, and even of the same famlies, brothers " by the same fathers and mothers as the fine gentle"men of the Bengal Airmiy, are seen in the ranks, "shoulder to shoulder-nay, even sleeping in the "same tent, with the Mahratta, the Dhor, and the "Purwarree, without scruple or thought of objec- tion." Afterwards, too, wve are told that the Bombay soldiers will build houses, manufacture bricks, and, in short, "turn their hands to any " labour which they may be ordered to execuate," without any talk of defilement or degradation. Clearly, therefore, the evil has lain less in the system of caste itself than in the system by which castes were unnecessarily recognized. It is impossible, indeed, to give a more complete or comprehensive explanation of the whole case than is contained in the author's simple remark, that the Bombay Sepoy prides himself upon being a soldier, tho Bengal Sepoy upon being a .-indoo. Let the reader but consider what a world of error has been involved in the policy thus expremed. 'We have not been maintaining a military force in Bengal; we have been preserving a hotbed of Hindooism. We have taken the very prejudices most obnoxious to civilization and authority, and pampered them with extraordinary solicitude. We have enrolled Hindoos on terms of their own dictation, recognized them as Brahmins while we paid them as soldiers, given them an organization which they would never have acquired of themselves, and placed arms in their hands, so that they might feel their own strength and terrify their employers. The word " Sepoy" is a misnomer. Our Bengal Army consisted, not of soldiers, but of Brahmins-of men who guided their conduct, not by the rules of the service, but by pretensions of their creed. It was an institution for the elevation of Brahminism and the preaervatzon of caste. This is really no exaggerated picture. Colonel JAcoB himself remarks, that " a "native soldier in Bengal is far more afraid of an "offrence against caste than an offence against the "Articles of War," and he relates an anecdote of the Sepoys of a regiment demanding, and obtaining, the dismissal of a comrade who, though an excellent soldier, fell short of the Brahminical at*ndazd of purity. After this; we cma eertsinljy wonder no longer that in the Bengal Army there should have been " an entire absence of proper " discipline," nor will it be otherwise than favourable to the work of reorganization that the old framework of such a force has been annihilated altogether.
Dr. LIvINosTON empties out the African cornucopia with great effect before the commercial public of Manchester, formed in a circle around him, and looking on as a crowd of children looks on the clearing out of the interier of a Noah's Ark. The orecious contents come tumbling out in rich profusion upon each other, rolling on the floor, or accumulating in a luxuriant heap, as Dr. LIviNGsTox proclaims the admirable quality of the articles. There is great variety in Dr. LrviNGsToN's exhibition,-good eatables, good. clothing, metal for our tools and machinery, fibre for our paper, fruits of 25 different sorts, ivory, wax, wool, iron, malachite, coal, indigo, " buaze," wheat., and, lastly, sugar and cotton. The commercial public is extremely delighted at this addition to the wealth and resources of the bolid, hut some questions must be asked and anasv red satisfactorily before we can promise our- I selve, much benefit by the discovery. First of aU I comes the inporl ns question of labour. How are we to grow our cotton, or our sugar ; how are we -o dig ti. .' We cannot do this ourselves, it nu"'z c 1&AJ.a by native labour. Are the natives eriu'd to this labour, suited for it in body and in l raexcr? Dr. LIVINGSTON answers this ques- confidently in the affirmative. He describes ,"e natives as already fairly possessed of the idea of commerce and of regular labour and wages, so that we should not have to give them those ideas to begin with. In fact, they are not, according to his account, savages; they show already the rudiments of civilized life in these fundamental ideas. They already cultivate cotton to a certain extent for their own use, and the district of Angola produces "thirteen hundred cloths" annually. So small a quantity as this is not, of course, a sufficient test of the industry of the native and the ability of his labour to supply our demands; but Dr. LIVINGSTON believes "that if they had a " market they would cultivate largely, for "wherever they have an opportunity of selling any"thing they immediately begin to collect it." The trading propensities of the natives have made a decided impression on the traveller, who trusts to them as the basis of that productive porer in the native on which we depend for any successful working of African soil. He believes, " if they had a markets " the natives would cultivate articles of produce " with eagerness." We cannot, for our part, rely upon the trading animus of these tribes quite so confidently as Dr. LIVINGSTON appears to do as a proof of and pledge for their industry or productive power. Most savages, even the most wild, fantastic, and unmanageable ones, have some ideas of trade, and will barter the productions of their lorests or coasts for ornaments or weapons. It does not follow, because a native wiUlVt begin immediately "to collect" ivory or roots as soon as he hears of a market for them, that he will make a good labourer, and work regularly on the soil. Barter is wild trade, as revenge is w:'d justice, and the one is no more a pledge for regular commerce or systernatic labour than the other is a pledge for law. At the Fame time, the African natives appear to bave a more solid notion of trade than this savage one of barter, and so far as they have they will feel a stimulus to regular labour. They wiLL give regular work for regular gains. Dr. LIvInGSToN abo states as a fact that they do work for wages,-skilled labourers for fourpence, aud common labonrers for twopence a-day. This is important. and on the whole it is only fair to trust a sagacious traveller's impressions about a native population, its character and capacity, even when the actual fActs he mentions are not in them- i selves securities for the whole of what we want. We have got, then, if we trust our traveller, our labour, but now comes the question of conveyance. Row is the cotton to be transported when it is grown ? The answer to this question is, that the Western cotton district, Angola, is upon the coast, and that the Eistern cotton district would have the river Zambese for its channel to the sea. The natives are described as very anxious to get to the sea for purposes of traffic, which would be a security for their making the proper roads, if they were set to work. So far all sounds well, and Central Africa has moreover not only great variety of valuable produce, but it has what is most important if ever Englishmen are to live there as cotton-growers or sugar-growers-healthy districts. " The country "ascends eastwards from the WVest Coast to a height "of 5,000 feet above the level of the sea." All this Dr. LIVLNGSTON says is healthy country, though he does not say as much for the Eastern bide. He charms us too with his picture of the Ecenery of Central Africa, its forests of evergreens, laurels, and orange trees, its fruittrees yielding seeds containing the best and most pure oils. Here too grows the best wheat, " with " ears as long as his hand," and almost spontaneously, without plough or harrow, subsoiling or draining, liming or manuring;--" aU " that it requires is, that a woman with a little " hoe should nmake a hole in the ground, drop a "few seeds in, and push back the soil with her' " foot-in four months there is a crop of beautiful "wheat." Even irrigation isnotwanted inthe higher land. Honey abounds, and the honeybird invites the traveller to partake of the riches of the hives, and acts as a g-uide to them. Here, then, is a tempting region for an English settlement, when we make up ou-r minds to become African cottongrowers, and to rid ourselves of the burden on our conscience which slave-grown cotton inflicts, as well as secure ourselves from the peril of trusting to one single coinitry for all our supply of this article. Dr. LV,1VN(XGTON is enthusiastic on this subject. He looks to Central Afiica as the great ultimate rival to the American Slave States, as the ground on which the battle against slavery must be fought and won. He finds in this region, so exclusively devoted hitherto in the English imagination to drought and scorpions, barren sands, and scorching suns, a fine, well-watered, luxuriant coun-, try,with a temperateclimate, everyfruit for thetaste, and the staff of life abounding in it. He is fairly battling with the prejudice against Africa and bent on sending us there. We see no reason to doubt his main descripSion of the region and the soil The great difficulty lies with the people. It is true Dr. LIVINOSTON is confident here, and promises us excellent, good-tempered labourers; and there is Do reason why the African native should not have in him the rudiiments of this character, which by careful cultivati.ou may be developed and ma+ured. But we are afraid that this must be an affair of time. The slave system, it must fairly be a - mitted, has the advautage ia the matter of time; it cau drag a savage out of his native ftrest, and muake a labourer of bim there amnd then. There is no doubt that this has teen the temptation to slave labour-its triumph over time. It leaps with one bound, one ferocious tiger spring, to the result, and exults in an immediate energy and productive power, while justice and mercy are slowly hobbling to the industrial get!while philanthropic Dr. LIVINGSTON is training the African savage to regular babits of industry, oducating him, civilizing him, and fitting him for a place in the alorious ranks of self-disciplined and self-respecting ftree labour. This work in Africa, then, must be. we are afraid, an affaik of tigae, md in the meantime we must swallow our scruples and use Yankee cotton. But we do not mean in the slightest degree to discourage this African work on this ground. We only want people not to expect that an African native will be a good labourer in a moment, and give up the scheme in despair and disgust -vhen they find that he keeps them waiting.

FORIEnGI AD COLONIAL STAT10SS.-Thers appears to be eome misapprehension respecting the reduction authorized on the 23d May last in the postage of letters addressed to officers serving on board ships of war upon foreign and colonial stations. It frequently happens that upon letters chargeable with a foreign postage in addition to the British postage of 6d., the latter only is paid;* whereas, w,henever prepayment is either compulsory or Intended, both poatages should be paid. Thus, upon prepaid letters forwarded Sid Marseilles. addressed to officers serving on board ships of war in the Mediterranean, India, or China, and upon all letters r ifl Msrseilles, azdreseed to officers on board 'ki"s of war in Anstralia or l\ew Zealand, not only the British rate of 6d. per half ounce, but the French transit rate of 3d. per quarter ounc, must be prepaid. In like manner, upon a11 letters addressed to officers serving on board ships of war on the Pacific station, thc New Granadian transit rate of Gd. per half ounce must be paid in advance, in addition to the Briish rate of Gd. per half-ounce. ROnBBERIS FROM JE aE}LERS' SnoPs.-During the past week a number of robberies have been committed at various towns between London and Yorkshire by a yonng man and young woman respectably attired in mourning, of good addrees, and genteel appearance generally. Their operations, which are in all cases the ea,sie. wern first brought under the notice of the police at Derby, afterwards at Doncaster, and subsequently at Leeds, and it is supposed they have carried on their depredatioDs in several other towns. Their modus operandi is this:- They enter a jeweler's shop and request to be shown some article, genetally a gold watch, and after a leugthened examination they make a selection, and request tbat a naime may bo engraved on the case, leaving half a sovereign as a deposit and promising to call again. Of course they never return, the shopkeeper's suspicions are awakened, and he then finds himself minza a valuable watch, a gold guard, or a costly trinket. The quiet way in which these adroit thieves go about their work throw the shopkeepers off their guard, and they are thus em'ly plundered, .some of them to a greater extent than they are even afterwards aware of.

THE BRITISH PETRA GE S¶INCE HER I MAJBSTYrS ACCESSION. Whilo the public are interested in the elevation of Mr. Maoarslay and Lord lItobert Groevenor to the Peerago it may not be out of place to lay before our readers a brief rdsurnd of the titles thus far conferred since Her Majesty's accession. On the 21st day of June, 1837, Queen Victoria, on coming to tho Throne, found the House of Peers composed of about 450 members, exolusive of the spiritual lords and the Seotch and Irish representativce. Her Majesty's first act was to give an English title to the Scottish Duke of Roxburghe, then just of age, by creating him Earl Innes, and to elevate to the Earldom of Leicoster the laet father of the H:ouse of Commwons and the friend of her Royal father, Mr. T. W. Colke, of Ho3khain, who had oftenzor fused the inferior dignity of a Baron. At the coronation, in June, 1838, Mr. Pounon by, the ex.member for Dorsetshire, Mr. Hanbury.Tracv, for Tewkesbury, Sir John Wrottesley, for Staffordshire, and Mr. Paul Methuen, for Wiltehire, all of whom had lost their Eeats at the previous general election, were advanced to the English baronies of De Manley, Sudeley, Wrottes!ey, and Mothuen. At the same time Her Majesty conferred English baronies on the Irish Lords Lismore and Carew, and on the Scottish Earl of Kintore, ad. vancing Lords King and Dundas to the earldoms of Lovelaco and Zetland, and the Earl of Mfulgrave to the Marquisite of Normauby, and sunmmoning the present Duke of Leeds to the Upper House as *Lord Ohb wrae In the course of the same year the title of Lord Vaux of Hrrowden was revived in the person of Mr. G. Mostyn. In the course of the following year Lord Melbourne elevated to the Peerage a " hatch" of his own more immediate friends and supporters, including his own brother Frederick, long ambausador at Vienna who became Lord Beauvale; Colonel Talbot, many years tho Liberal member f-r the county of Dublin, asLord Furnival Sir John T. Stanley, as L-rd Stanley of Alderley; MIr Vifliers Stuart, as Lord Stuart de Decdes; Mr. Charles Brownlow,who had long sat for the countyof Arnmagh,as LorI Lurgan; and hIr. Beilby-Thompson, as Lord Wenlock,- f title which had for a short time been enjoyed by his brother, the late Sir Francis Lawley; while Mr A. French, the veteran M.P. for Roscommon, accepted the title of De Freyne. At the same time in Mr. Chandos Leigh the ancient barony of Leigh was revived, and Mr. Ridley Colborne, who had sat for many years for Wells and otber places, became Lord Colborne, the first and the last of that titlo. In the same year the late Lord Ponsonby, then ambassador at Consthtinople, was promoted to a viseountoy which has since expired with him; Mr. Abercromby, after a four years' tenure of the Speakership, was advanced to the title of Lord Dun. fermline; the ancient Camoys title was also revived in ths person of Mr. Thomas Stonor, who had sat for Oxford for a few weeks in the first reformed Parliament. About the same time Mr. Spring Rice, on resgning the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, became Lord Monteagle of Brandon; Lord Auckland, the Goveraor-General of India, was advanced to an earldom; while tbe titles of Lord Keane and Lord Seaton were conferred on two General officers who had seen more than the ordinary sbare of foreign military service. In 1840 Mr. Miles Sta pleton obtained in his favour the revival of the ancient Barony of Beaumont, and Sir Jacob Astley, the ex-member for Norfolk, that of Hastings. In 1841 another " batch" of elevations were gazetted just before the retirement of the Melbourne Ministry. English baronies were then conferred on the Scotch Earl of Stair and the Irish Earl of Kenmare, while Sir John Campbell became at a leap Lord Campbell and Lord Chancellor of IrelandSir Hussey Vivian and Sir Henry Parnell were made respectively Lords Vivian and Congleton, the late Duk-e of Norfolk and the present Earl of Goeford at the same time being called to the Upper House in their father's baronies, and Lords Barham and Segrave being advanced to the Earldoms of Gainsborough and FitzHardinge. Not long afterwards Mr. Poulett Thompson, then GovernorGeneral of Canada, was created Lord Sydenham, but the title, we believe, became extinct within the year. In August, 1841, Lord Melbourne resigned, having conferred no lees than 42 coronets in four years. It is bat justice to his successor, the late Sir R. Peel, to state that he discontinued the establisbed practice, conferring the honours of the Peerage with a lavish hand. On taking offloe he found thal; there were two gentlemen whose servioes he required in the IUpperHouse. They were the eldestsons of peers, andlhad long enjoyed seats inthe Commons. Thesenoblemen Her Majesty -was pleased at once to callito the Upper House in their fathers, baroniee, and they are now the Earls of Derby and Lonsdale. At the same time the late Lord Hill, the Commander-inChief at the Horse Guards, was advanced from a barony to a viscountoy. Sir Robert Peel remained in office till the close of the summer of 1946, juet five years; but during that time the only other English peerages conferred were the Barony of Metcalfe (since extinct) on the late Sir C. T. Metcalfe, the Earldom of Ellesmere on Lord Francis Egerton, and the Viscountoy of Uardinge on Sir Henry lIardinge, besides the advancement of Generat Gough to;a barony, and of Lord Ellenborough to an earldom, for their Lndian career On their return to office in September, 1846, the Whig party renewed their practice of increasing the Peerage. In the five years during which Lord John Russell held ofEice we find the Earl of Dalhousie advanced to a marquisate, Lords Strafford and Cottenham to earldoms, and Lord Gough to a viacountoy, while the baronies of Dartrey, Mlilford, Egin, Clandeboye, Eddisbtry, Londesborough, Oversone, Truro, Cranworth, and Broughtonwere conferrod respectively upon Lord Cremorne, Sir RE B. Philipps, the E;arlof Elgin, Lord Dufferin, Mr. E. J. Stanley, Lord Albert Conyngham, Mr. Jones.Loyd, Sir Thomas Wilde, Sir R. M. Rolfe, and Sir John Cam Hobbouse. Mr. Byng, too, was called to the Upper House as Lord Strafford. It was the boast of Lord Derby that during his brief Ministry of 1852 he had advised Her Majesty to raise to the Peerage three individuals, and three only-Sir Edward Sugden, Lord Fitzroy Somerset, and Sir Stratford Canning, since better known to our reader3 as Lords St. Leonard's, Raglan, and Stratford de Redcliffe. Lord Aberdeen did not avail himself of his Premiership from 1852 to 1S55 to confer a sin gle Peerage on his friends. Tbe first English coronet bestowsed by Lord Palmerston vwa the unhappy life Peerage which lit upon the head of Baron Parke, but subsequently exchanged for one with a less questionable title. Since then Sir Gilbert Heathcoto has been made Lord Aveland; SLr E. Lyons, Lord Lyons; kr. E. Strott, Lord Belper; and the late Speaker, Mr. Shaw Lefevre, Viscount Eversley. Lords Renmare and Talbot de Malahide have been honoured with English baronies, and Lord Shelburne has been called to the Upper House in his father's barony of Wycombe; and now, last of all, we chronicle this day the elevation of Lord Robert Grosvenor and Mr. Macaulay to the enronets of English barons.
RAPID PASSAGR OF SHIPS TO INDIA. TO TEE EDITOlt OF THE TIMIRS. Sir,-Had your correspondent Mr. Coppinger observed thdate of Colonel Ixe,y's letter there would have been no myt.tery in the omission of the Lady Jocelyn as among the arrivals at St. Vincent's, Cape Verd Islands. The L&`'y Jocelyn did not arrive till tbe evening of the 20th, and Colonel Kelly's letter is dated, I think, the 19th. In common, I dare say, with other fathers of soldier sons on board, I received my letters from my son, an offioer of the Rifle Brigade; and they 'were well calculated to cheer anxious hearts at home. Nothing can sarpass the careful provision of the authorities for tbeir hsalth, comfort, and even enjoyment. They had beeu sailing at the rate of 250 miles in the 24 hours, and having left Cork harbour on she afternoon of the 9th of August had reached St. Vincent's on the 20th-less than 11 das- tbough with the wind dead against them for the first part of their passage. Tbey siled from St. Vinoent's on the 22d, not intending to touch either at Rio or the Cape, and anticipating a very quick voyage to Point de Galle. Your obedient servant, L. c.

SECOND EDITION. THEE TIMES-OFFICE, Saturday Morri?g. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The followiug is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Friday), 6 p.m.:- Despatches were received to-day at the Foreiga office from the French Minister at Ierlin, and vere forwarded to Count Walewski at Biarritz. It is said, or conjc_tured, that they relate to the alleged proposed interview between the Emp3ror of the French and the Kiug of Prussia, the idea of which is repor te(l to have been first suggested by Count H{atzfeldt, the Prussian Minister at Paris. In the total absence of intelligence of the slightest interest From any part of Europe, a vast number of rumours are daily circulated with respect to the approaching interviews of crowned heads in Germany, and details are supplied, more minute than authentic, with respect to the subjects that are to be discussed at them. No accounts havincg been received of the commencement of the Moldavian elections on the 15th day (9th iust.), from.X the receipt by Prince Yogoride- of his instructions from the Porte, it is now said that they are postponed in order that the i,vos Enperors may have some last words on the subject. Another iamour says that the Emperor of lhe French is to use his good offices with the Emperor Alexander to brinug about an amicable r approclesne,at between Eniland and Ruissia. These and mauy other reports of the kind are in all pro. bability mere inventions, destitute of founda. tion. The only thing certain is the interview at Stutgardt. General Fleury, the Emperor's aide-dc-camp charged with the direction of t'ie Imperial travelling equipages, has arrived in Paris from Chalons to give orders respecting the jt,arney, for which everything is t3 be ready on the 2(Ull inst. A letter from Rome states that, in consequence of the reduction of tbe Austrian troops in the Romnan States, the reconstitution of the Papal army is beingrapidly proceeded -with. To this end, a committee of five has been appointed, presided over by Cardinal Antonelli. From Turin we learn that the Duke de Gramont was not to leave until the 25th inst. In consequence of the accident wbich occurred at the Camp of Cahlons, where two artillerymen were -woiuded in consequence of the negligence in closing the touch-hole oi a gun, the Emperor, who was much shocked by their misfortune, has appc'in ted a commission to devise a plan for preventing such accidents in future. A paper mentions that M. Gust-ve Oppelt, a Belgian officer, has invented what he calls an obturator, which he undertakes will r ;rfectly cloze the touch-hole of a gun while ic is beiig chargud. A large piece of ground in the Champs Ely,6es, near the Palace of Industry, has been granted to a society of artists, and a building has already been commenec I upon it, in which are to be exhibited a succession of panoramic views of a high class, illustrating great historical events, wars, festivals, and ceremonies of recent aud present times. The Con- "In grantinr this ground, the Government and the Municipal Aemnin tration have had, above all, in viewthe endow. ing of Palis with a new monument, worthy to figure among thoNe which have aiisen within the last few years, and at the sanne tilleO accessible to all. The galleries of the Louvre present the m%sterpiecesof the greatest painters; iu th, halls of Versailles we find maguificent pages in which ard rolated the events of the past; the muszum of the Charnps D!ys&ies w l1 retrace, with the Sid of the best artists of the c ;ntemporay school. the history of the present. The bu;ld. ing8, of a characturlNtic architecture, wiiU be vast enough to contain a numerous throng, and their internallarrangements will pormit all the pictures to be exhibited Aith a peufect 77i.ie len s6irn, thanks to the brilliani. effect nf the elentric light.", The li-st reiies of views are to be from the Crimrean campaign. M. Durand Brager, who was in the Crimea, and some of whose pictures have been much admired in this year'es Exhibition of living Artists, has undertaken the direction and arrangeinent. The entrance-hall of the new building will contain a collection of plans in relieco, on tbe scale of 1 to 100, of the works undertaken by the Artillery and Eng;neers for the attack and deftnce of Sebastopol; besides these will be showa models of rocket batteries, Laucaster guns, &c. In the fecoud hall will be the representation of a long battecy, the embrasures of which will be fillec by pictures representing the chief episodes of the war, from Alma to the capture of Sebastopol. Oni the groutd iloor wijI be large galleries, where mliiitary bandls wivll play, and which will sex ve as a promenade. Tu short, if the scheme is carried out on the scale and s- ith the perfection indicated by the programme, this n( w exhibition will be one of the 11ost attractive amuong the nmany that already embellish Paris. 1'rince Napoleon is now at Biarritz. He was afterwards to have paid, a visit to MI. Fould at Tarbes, but that Minister has come to Paris in consequence of the lamentable acc;dent to his son. It is sa:d that the Prince will go to Enigland to witness the launch of the Great Eastern, and that he thinks of going afterwvards to Suez, to study the question of the canal on the spot. M. M1'Ceirthy, a member of the Geographical Society of Pacris, has just started on a journiey to Timbuetoo. He speaks Arab and various African dialects with great fluency. He travels alone. The Paris papers continue to devote their principal attention to the Indian insurrection. The Sierlc (in a long article) first replies to some of the extravagant effusions of the Urir,rs, and then, asauming that misgovernment is the cause of the Sepoy revolt, but without advancing anly facts in suipport of its opinion, advises England to chauge her system, and holds up France to her as a model, in the following terms:- " England may now see, by the good example which we have set her in Algeria, what an erroneous and dan,gerous path she has been following. France has been tmuch repr.ached with being unskiloul in colonization. That may be the case, but she possesses a sk:Ul which we value much moro higbly; she enforces notions of justice and of right anong the p: aple submitted to her domination ; she dors not much o.cupy herseLf with knowin , whether the Mnssulmans wiU become converts t, Catholieism, but she respe*s tbem in their religious faith; she protects thea anad fx mniliarizes them with our ideas and our habits; she goverrs tbemn paternally, endeavours to inculoate the prinoiple of property and family ties; attaches them to tho soil; opens markets for their productions, and contributes as much as lies in her powrer to the development of their welfare. So long as France shall conti-aue in that path, so long as she shall act towards Mussulmnan Algeria as a father would act towards his cbildren, or as an elder brother towards his younger ones, her rile will not be Fhakeen. It Is oDly because Eagland has not acted in this manner, and not because she is Protetant, that she now finde her power In Iodia so seriously menaced. Though an Evangelical nation, she has forgotten to engraft Evangelical principles in her laws, her cegulations, and her relations with the Indians; she has treated those men, children of God, as a shepherd treats the flock which he shears. She is now punished for thig, aad, whatever may be our bmpathies for that great nation, we do not hesitate to say that she is juatly chastened.-I. The S&cle seems to lose sight of the fact that the rebellion, according to the best information as yet received, seems limited to the Sepoys and the refuas of the population. The former, it is well known, have no cause for complaint, und, among tbeir countrymen, their condition has long been looked i:apon as happy and enviable. Referring also to the 'iuflammatory tirades of the Ussivers, the Dgbats has the following observations:- 6"To speak seriously on a grave subject, we do not think ,. proper for the French pres to show itself hostile and sst iowards England during the crisis thich sho is now passix., through in India. Even should these disturbances Wr ease and be prolonged, as England is our ally, it wou2't be impossible for us to derive any advantage fron' her difficulties without breaking with her; and then the question wil arise as to the propriety of that step, which shotld be discussed with good faith before the public. Whateo,er our opponents may Ray, we are not irrevocably attached to , Y alliance, and in that, as in everything else, we are ready to C'0 tO the side of what we shall be clearly shown is the interest o.' France. But it is useless now to enlarge the question; e5 ery one knows that unless England be not interrupted in tsr task by a European war, she will certainly overcome, in a gtyen time, her revolted Indian army, nnd then what wlll there r-emain of all the noise which is now being made by certain jour.nals about this insurrectiont? Nothing but the duable remembrance of a fruitless malevolence and an impotent jealousy. Such sentiments do not accord with those of the French nation, of which they are unworthy; and we wilU say, in conclusion, to the journals that express them,-When one is at peace with one's neighbour the language of peaos should be used. When war is desired, the fact should be loyally announced, and the reasons given." A private letter from Teheran, of the 23d July, gives some interesting details relative to the Persian army, and to the state of the country since the capture of the town of Herat. At this moment the Shah of Persia has 100,000 infantry and 120,000 cavahy under arms. Of the cavalry there are not more than 11,000 regtulars, and they belong to the Royal Guard. This army is a heavy charge for the population on which it isquartered. The irregular cavalry particularly, which is commanded by its Khans, and over whom the Government has but little control, forms an undisciplined mass, which plunders the peasants of every article it requires for its support. Tte artillery is like the regular infantry, well organized and well disciplined. It consists at present of four regiments of 1,200 men each, who are well instructed in their profession. The mat el is good, although the calibre of the gLus is too varied. The waggon train is excellent. The Persian ai tillery possesses a regiment of Zumburchis, composed of six compailies. The Zumburchis are artillerysnen, mounted on camels. Each camel carries a light field-piece. The Zumburchis are commanded by a colonel, two majors, six captains, and 12 lieutenants. The most contradictory reports were current at the date of this letter on the subject of whit is passing at Herat. The Sirdar Murad-Mirza had been accused of refusing to surrender the citadel, but he had sent a iustification of himself to the Court, wshich was fully admitted. The Hon. Mr. Murray, the British Minister, had combatted the excuse of 'Murad-Mirza and demanded the execution of the treaty of peace. The Persian Government then proposed to send two commissioners toHeratto ascertain the real position of the place. Colonel Taylor, a military attache of the British Legation, was choEen by Mr. Murray, and the Shah chose one of his aides. de-ea mp. They immediately set out for Herat, and Colonel Taylor has been further empowered to see that the treaty is executed. If it be considered propsr to ev;cuate Herat lnder existiug circumstances, it will be done forthwith. The evacuatioa of Herat will permit the Shah to make a considerable reduction in his army, for the Sirdar Uiurad-Mirza has more than 0,C030 men under his commaud. These troops are excellent soldiers, end the Sirdar, who is said to be a g.eat favourite with his men, is accused of ambitious projects, and of intending to proclaim himself Prince Sovereign of Herat. The writer of the letter does not believe that Murad-Mirza has any such intention; he admits, however, that if such an event should take place it would seriously complicate the position of the English in that part of Asia, particularly under existing circumstances in India. The Shah is said to be animated with the best intentions. His late edicts, by which his Mussulman, Christian, and Jewish subjects are placed on an equality, will, it is feared, encounter much opposition from the fanaticism of the inhabitants. The British troops had evacuated Bushire, and Emira-Mirza, the new governor, had taken possession of that town on the 28th June. The amcounts from the interior of Persia are good. Fez]ali-Khan, who commands the troops of Fars, has recently chastized the Tnrcomans, 'who were perpetually pillaging the coast. The Shah had quitted Teheran, with his court, accompr-ied by the foreign Ambassadors, to encamp at the foot of Mount Elbourtz, where he is sheltered from the intensoe heat of the sun. iHe has likewise established a catnp there, in which 12,000 men ate constantly man>uvred. The Fenclh squadron of evolutions, under command of V-ice-Admiral Trehouart, and consisting of the steamehips of the line Bretagne, Urm, Tourvlle, A'lsterlitz, Algeciras, Arcole, Prince Jerome, the steam-frigate Isly, and steam-corvette Duchayla, cast anchor on the 31st of August off Tanis,proceeiing from Ajacc;o. The Prefect of Police has addressed a circular to the comumissaries of police of Paris, ordering a general visit t) be made at the shops of all the park butchers, as well as of fruitsellers, grocers, and others where salted pork, smoked hams, and sausages are sold. The object of this measure is to ascertain wvhat part of their stock may have been rendered un!it for food by the extreme heat which has tlis summer prevai!ed. Any articles which may be found in a bad state are to be taken possession of aud removod from the premiscs, and a proces verbal iuadle of the fact. The officers cbarged with the inspection are also to e`a mine what vessels are used by the pork butchers; to see that they do not use salt that has already served ; that the water of the wells or pumps on their premises is iJ a wholesome condition ; and that the whole of their establishment is kept in a proper state. The shops of butchers, pastrycooks, and traitcurs are also to undergo a simiiar inispection.

It is now about six weeks or two months since I Szat reported to you the declining state of the King of Sweden's health, which was of a nature to preI vent him from attending to public business, andlia consequence caused great ineonvenience to the State at the moment, as well as anxiety for the future. I The Thrious measures resorted to since thesm by his medical advisera - change of air, repose, e4-cq iave not attained the desired results, and the. Iatest aaws we have remei7c from Stockholr.it.4 that certain physicians, after careful and leng'thY consultation, have pronounced their opinion tj'.t the King of Sweden wiU not be in a fit state to resu.7o the conduot of State affairs for 12 months to come. In consequence of this very distinct and positive declaration of the King's incapacity for the further cares of 1Government, the Estates of the kingdom are about to be consulted, with a view to the carryiug out the proT;sions of the Constitution with reference to this contingency. The 92d Article of the Constitution, which is the article that is referred to as applying to the state of things that has now supervened in Sweden, opens with these words-" Wlhen the illness of the King is of that natare that he does not attend to public business for more than 12 months ;" aud, as theze wordscontemplateaprovedincapaoityof the monarch, by his having actually withdrawva from public business during 12 months past, we may infer thae the application of the paragraph in question to the present state is an evidence that there is no hope at all of his eventual recovely. KIng Oscar of Sweden has only just completed the 58th year of his age, aud the 13th of his reigna, during which latter period he has been recognized as one of the wisest, best-informed monarchs then reigning, and who dlisplayed the greatest skill and prudence in the conduct of home affairs and the development of the resources of his country. On the other hand, a want of energy has been imputed to him, and unfavourable contrasts have been drawn between him and bis grandfather, Bernadotte, on th;s point, but a due examination of the diffe. rence of the tiuies and ci-cumrtances in which they both lived, as well as the subjects that have been brought under theit dccision, would probably go far to alter this judgment. His eldest son, Prince Charles, Crown Prince and Duke of Scania, who has lately been nominated to the Viceroyalty of Norway, will, in all probability, be appointed Regent by the Estates for the small remainder of his father's lifet.ime, and at his death he will succeed to him. The character of this heir to the Swedish throne, now 31. years old, is not of a nature to iuspire his future subjects with great confidence or hope in the result of his reign, since it seems to be chara^terized by a total want of all bis father's wisdom and prudence, without as yet having had any opportunity of exhibiting any more brilliant qualities. With the people at large he is understood to be popular, from his easy, effable manners, and the exhibition of a variety of small traits of a liberal off-hand character, but the reflecting portion of the community look with far more satisfactionto the mind and disposition of his younger brother, Oscar, Duke of Ostrogothia, who in almost all respects resembles his father. As Priuce Charles, the Crovia Piluce, and probably by tlis time the Regent of Sweden aid Norway, lately lost his orly son, the infeaut Duke oc Sudermanuland, and his daughter are excluded by the terms of the constitution from the suecession to the throne, Prince Oscar is in fact already the heir presumpLive to the tbrone. This retirement of the wary and cautious King of Sweden from the conduct of affairs is of unusual importance at this moment with reference to the constantly increasing magnitude of the Scandinavian movements, of which the Crown Prince is knowrn to be an ardent supporter, as is also the case with his younger brother; for the aproaching crisis of the conflict between the Radical Government of Denmark and the GeIman duchy of Holstein, now engaged in a last struggle to save itself from incorporation with the Scandinavian kingdom, backed as it is by its Federal allies in Germany, will hardly fail to press upon Earope the conviction of the ncceswity of creating a strong Scandinaviau kingdom out of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and of separating frcm the latter that Geiinan Duchy of Holstein porate at the expense of every dictate of justice and public law. The existenes of Holstei n as an integral poition of the territory attached to the Danish Crown constitutes Denmark's greatest weakness; for its Germis' population, which owns no other fealty thaD to the person of the King as their Duke, has been thorougbly estranged by the events of the lsst 10 or 11 years, and the unremitting attempts of the Danish Government to bring it by all or any means into the .a meposition as Schleswig. The policy,however,which with 3uch powerful States as Russ-a and Austria has succeeded with Poland and Hungary has not, as yet, availed much with the compa'atively powerless Denmark, and will hardly do so as long as an appeal lies from Copenhagen to the German Confcderation and to Europe at large. The constant disunion of the constituent parts of the Danish monerchy makes Denmarlk always dependent on foreig&A aid and support; and this she finds iu Russia, whose eventual claims to the crown of Denmark are deslved from a small portion of Holstein territory, and who is, consequently, warmly interested in the retentiou of Holstein in Danish possession, and Denmark in Russian dependence. The evil consequences we felt in the late war; Denmark persisted in neutrality, though Sweden was willing, if Denmark would have joined, to take part with us; aad, had Deamark done so, Prussia must have done so, much as it was opposed to her best inaterests. When the I moment comes, which will come soon, for revising the London Protocol of 1852, it is to be hoped that our Cabinet will no longer be found playing into Russia's hands as it did then, and had done for years before. As may easily be supposed, these changes in the hand that wields the sceptre of the neighbouring Scandinavian kingdom are watched with the greatest interest in Denmark, where a large party is already formed in favour of the union of the Scandinavian Kingdoms, and a still larger one for getting rid of the German Duchy out of the kingdom of Denmark. The King of Denmark will, in the course of this month, visit both Jutland and Scbleswig, and be absent from his insular dominions for about two or three weeks. RUSSIA. We learn by telegraph that the Emperor of Russia arrived at Warsaw on the afternoon of tbe 6th-inst. Field-Marshal de Parrot prcoeeded from Lemberg to compliment his Majesty in the maine of, the Emperor of Austria. Baron de Budberg, the Russian Minister at Vienna; M. de Noroff, Minister of Publia Opinion; and M. Timowski1 Minister Secretary of State for the Kingdom of Poland, have also. arrived at Warsaw. The Emperor wiU lcelebrata the first anniversary of his accession at the Polish capitaL His Majesty was expectei to lea&,Warsaw on the 13th for Germany. SPAIN. The Madrid journ %Is of the 7th contain no political news. A repo rt to the Queen from the President of the Coun' *il, published in the GazeUe, shows that according to. the census just taken, the population of Spain a mounots to 15,518,616, as already an. nounced, or3 3S-5NtqN more than at thelast census. At Barcelon A' the Captaiu-General had interdicted the formati- n of mutual benefit societies, experience having sh, )wn that, by affording ready relief to workmen, they encouraged strikea.

THE SUPP.EBBS BY THE INDIAN fUTINIiES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have taken the liberty of sending you the enclosed oopy of proceedings regarding the objects of a fund which has been formed at this place for the prelief of Such of our countrymen as have lost their all in?the late fearful disturbances of the North-West Provincee of Ben gal and begyour iaid in brnging the matter belore the public in England. The first impressions of every Englishman on perusing the sad details of the insurrection will be astonishment and grief at the enormous ingratitude of those whose treachery has been aggravated by murders of the foulest and most cowardly description. But after these feelings shall have found vent the mind will turn from this general view of these events to the contemplation of individual suffering, and the question naturally arises, ' What is to be done to redress and relieve those 'who have been rendered vidows or orphans, childless or homeless, disabled or beggared, by this inlooked-for revolution ?" In the Punjab and Scinde the English communities have at once earnestly set themselves to work, and within the short space of three weeks 300 or 400 English gentlemen, scattered over an area of nearly 160,000 square miles, have collected a sum eqaivalent to 3,0004. More money will quickly pour in, for over the whole of India the active sympathy of every Englshmau will be exerted on behalf of the unfortuAate safferers. But the English society in India is too limited to be able to do as much as they could wish in order to effectually relieve the misery which has been brought home to their very doors, and, altbough the subscriptions are on a mo t liberal scale, still it is not probable that they will amount to more than 15,O0uf. The demands on this sum will te very great. A large number of people will have to be clothed aud fed for many months. Many will bave to be sent to England. The people of England will not forget how nobly the Iudian exiles responded to the call for the Patriotic Fund, and that from the 50,000 English in India no less than 137,0001. were collected. The scenes of misery and destitution relieved by the agency of the Patriotic Fund are aggravated when, as in a country like India, the sufferers are far away from their homes and remaining relatives. If the extremity of hoiar suffering, increasea by the recollection of the fearful scenes these poor sufferers have lately gone through, can move us, our heat ~s should bleed for these unfortunate people, as they never bled at any form of woe before. Nothing has been vanting to render their memories terrible to them, and their present state of utter destatution is the least of the miseides they have encountered. To your kind offices I will now leave the question, and beg thst you will so place it before the British public in your all-powerful eolumns that the Indian ms'erers may ever have cause to bless your exertions on their behalf. The Commissioner in Scinde, Mr. H. Bartle Frere, autho. rizes me to say that he wUl allow any oommunications and remittances made to the committee to be sent through him. Subscriptions will be received ascd remitted to India by Forbes, Forbes, and Co., King William-street, to the Bombay geny of their firm.

MILITARY AND NA L. GRNTELLI(BNOR. I - The Royal Artillery Company of Geeltemen Cadets at Woolwich, under the command of Captain G. D. Shakespear were paraded yesterday morning under armg in field-day order, in the gronnds of tho institution, and were supp}Led With blank ammunition for the inspection of the CounInm.ndAnt of tho garrison, Major-General SirW. F. Wiliamg KC.3. After receiving the General wvith the usual salate a minute Inspection of the eadets took pL, which was SuC ceeded by f3se company marching past in slow and quick time. They were subsequently put through the man=ual exercise by gentleman Cadet Rait, of the practical class, A suecesion of field evolutions ws then performed by tho ttalion, and several rounds of ammunition were fired irr a soldierly mTnnor, after which they formed upon their originrs ground, and again saluted the General by presenting arms, &c., the band striking up "God save the Queen." The battaliou was then formed intosquare, when General Williams expressed his approbation of the result of his inspection, and i ssured the men that their steady efficioncy and soldkirlke appearance under arms had exceeded his expectations. He urged them to persevere in the respectivo branches of their meritorioas studies, and, alluding to the calamities In the East, which evinced a probability that their professional duties might be required in a sphere of active service where rapid promotion would crown their success, he hoped they would not only by their gentleuannly deportment and moral conduct prove a comfort to their parents, but an bonour te their country. The General, who was accompanied throughout the inspection by Colonel Wilford, the governor of the institutiori, Complimented Captain Shakespear and tho officers of the company on their successful efforts in raising it to its high state of proficiency under their miltary training. He also referred in terms of high commendation to the soldierly tcie and manner in which Gentleman Cadet wait had performed his duties, and the correctness with which GentlenAn Cadet Walker acqutitted himself as Adjntant on thL field. The Commandant thence proceeded to visit the barrack-rooms, workshops, reading-room, and studies, and subsequently attended in the refeotory, where the Cadets were assembled for dinner, and expressed himself extremely pleased with the interior arrangements of the instltution, and Its admirable order and neatness, which, he remarked, he would not fail to bring underthe favourable consideration of Lord Panmure. Captain Penrose, of the Woolwich division of Royal Marines, proceeded yesterday on recruiting service to Market Harborough, Leicestershire, and Captain Daviel also of the Royal Marine Light Infantry, was ordered yesterday to York on a similar service. The dep6t of the 92d Highlanders were to leave Fort George on Thursday by steamer from Granton for Stirling. The remainder of the 72d depfit were to leave Fort George at the same time for Aberdeen, the fort being tbereby vacant of troops exceepting invalids of the Artillery in the meantime. The following promotions have taken place in the corps of Royal Marine Light Infantry:-Captain F. L. Alexmnder, of the Chltham division, has been appointedto the Artillery companies at Portsmouth, vice Captain A. R. Savage, deceased; First Lieutenant and Adjutant J. H. Parry, of the Chatham division, has been promoted to be Captain, vice Alexandei, and appointed to the same division. On Thursday morning the head-quarters division of the 5th Drag6on Guards, under the command of Lieutenant. Colonel M'Mahon, left Piershill-barracks, and commenced their march for Carlisle, proceeding by Galashiels, Hawick, &-c. From Carlisle the regiment will proceed to the port of embareation for India. On Thursday afternoon the head-quarters division of the 16th Lancers, under the command of lieutenant-Colonel Pattle, arrived at Piershillbarracks, having marched the landwar2 part of the journey from Belfast. Captain Wright's company of Royal Artillery arrived at Portsmouth from Alderney yesterday in the Sylph steam vessel, landed, and proceeded by railway to Woolwichb A detachment, one company, 47, leaves Portsmouth this morning for Marchwood, Sauthampton, to relieve a company of Royal Artillery ordered for duty in Portcmonth garrison. The camp at Colchester has just been strengthened by the arrival of the 56th depot from Pembroke, under the command of Captain Hugh Eceles, the other officers with the depOt being Lieutenants Watson and Hampton, and Ensigos Buchner and Laver. Three other depOts, under orders to march, are daily expected, and these will complete the complement of Indian regiments expected to occupy these barracks. The 7.3d and 77th depOts are ready to start at a moment's notice, their destination being Jersey; and the 2d battalion of the 2d Queen's Royals, which has just been formed, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bruce, vwill probably be removed when a sufficient nunmber of recruits has been enlisted. Within a few days between 60 and 70 strong ablebodied men have arrived to join the 2d V-1. 1 4-kA ,n;sA D.. o f - 0 21 ' M ww D l - tion is brought to the camp that the enlistment of recruits for the 2d battalion is progressing satisfactorily. It is wo thonght that some alteration will take place in the constitution of the camp. Tue strength of the garrison is now 2,200 rank and file. Messrs. James Bainosand Co., tho owners of the clipper ship Ligbtning which recently sailed from Gravesend with troops belonging to the Indian depots at the provisional battalion, Chatham, have forwarded to the authorities the haudsome donation of 1001. to be distributed among the soldiers' wives and children who have been left behind at Chatham. It is to be hoped that other shipowners may be induced to foUow the example of the owners of the Black BaU line, as considerable destitution prevails among the families of those soldiers who have embarked for India, the highest sum aUowed them by the War-offlce being 6d. per day, which is aLtogother inadequate for tho maintenance of a family of several children. Orders have been received at Chatham for the following changes to be made in the medical staff of officers at that garrison:-StaffAssistaut-Surgeon Leslietoproceed toBel. fast; Staff Assistant-Surgeon Elliott to proceed to Win. chester, to join the dep6t battalions at that station; Staff Assistant-Surgeon M'Grath has proceeded from Chatham to Dublin for the purpose of joining the 94th Regiment, under orders for India; Staff Assistaut.Surgeon Sherky has receivea orders to prooeed to Canterbury to do duty with the depot battalion at that station; Staff Assistant Surgeon Neire proceeds to Limerick for the purpose of being attached to the 2d battalion of the 3d Buffs, which is about being formed. A very handsome officer's svord has been presented by Colonel E. A. Parker, Commandant of the Chat. ham Division of Royal M-arine Light Infantry, to Quartermaster J. Lewis, late senior Sergeant-Major at Chatham, on the occasion of his being promoted to the rauk of Quartermaster of the Portsmouth division, as a mark of the high estimation in which that officer is held by the Commandant and the whole of the officers of the Royal Maxines at Chatham.

FATAL Co.LRY EXPLO0SIO.;-DUDLXY, Frid&y. -Another of those terrible accidents for which this part of the country bh3 unhappily of lWe gained in unenviable. notoriety took phoce at Netherton, aabort distanac from this town, yesterday. The colliery at which the explosion took place is oalled the G.roomn Colhery, and we regret to add that aready seven dead bodies hsvebeenremovedfromthe pit, and it is feared tbae there are one or-two more lives sacrificed. The catastrophe, we fear, is tc> be. trawed to the carelessnets and indifference to danger exhibited by the colliers themselves. The oircunmstanes, as far as they can be ascertained in the present confusion, are as follows:-The pit where th& explosion oconrred ia an old one, and had. not been worked for sonmetime pst until very reently, and the colliers were told tbat there was gas in that part of the colliery* piles bad also been laid down for the purpose of arr,in2 le off At tbh tims of the exelosion it is supposed there were about 20 mens in the iine. The exploeiona was a terriiio one, and was he&!d; for nles round the spot. It shouk the grouxd like an earthquake, and spread consternation whorever it vwns felt, the inbabitant, of this district being unfortunately too familiar with events of this kind. The fames ruased up the air shaft of the mine with terrific fury, blowsing the apparatus, &c., into the, air o a coubiders.blh distance, and the column of' fuie frorc the explosion asoended many yards above the mouth of the pit. The flames ignited the coal in the pit, and it wvas not until a copious supply of water had been cat into the nine that the iro was extinguished, In thiai respec; though bappily in a minor diegee, thcca4tastropbh resembles the terrible event, at Lundbill colliery. .A.n immense mass of stone and coal has been, dsodged, and sevtn or eight yards of the bo,iom of the rli*I bave been blo,.ik iu. Up to midday to-day (Friday) seven dead hodies had been recovered from the pit, and ten or eleven others of the miners have been rescued alive, though, soMe of themn have received severe injuries. The iimuedi&tM cause of the accident has not bean ascertained, but the district Government inspector is on tbe spot iLnd will make. the strictest investigation irnto the circumstances. The, bodies have bet1 removed tv an inn near the aoene ot t;4 scoident, and the inquest it is expected wi be openod to, morrow before the local coroner, for the purpose of identifying the bodirs, when it is expected an adlourmnexst will tale plaee to afford tirme for the productioa of evidnce.

THE LIBEBTY OF THE PB 1N INDIA. The following is a return to an order of the House of Commons, dated August 18, 1857, for COpiff of ally despatch from the (overnor-General of India, stating hin iasons for mrking the Act No. 15, 1857, f or the restriction of the liberty of the press, applicable to the European portion of the population as well aXs to the native .- " To the Eon. the Court of Directors of thie East India Comnpany. "H Eon. Slrs,-In our deepatoh, No, 54, dated the 18th nit., your hon. Court were Informed that on the 13th Idem the eiFslative Council, on the motion of the GovernorGeneral, made with our full and unanimous concurence, after aniOUs deliberation, passed without a dissentient voice an Sot, No. 15 of 1857, wohereby the liberty of the press od India is restricted for the period of one year from that date. The effec of thi6 la wl be to replae the Indian pres during this year very much ia the position in which it was permanently before Sir Charles MeteSalfe's Governmnent in 1835 passed Act; No. 11 of that year, wrhereby complete liberty ws given to it. "2. Act No. 11 of 1835 wv psed in oppositlonto the sbrODg opinions of many eminent Indian officers, at the head of whom may be placed Sir Thomas Munro, wshose well. kcnown minute, dated the 12th of April, 1822, contains what wre believe to be the most weighty rgmnent against the grant in India of the same abeolute freedom of the press, wshich is one of the prineipal means of good administraton In a free State, consising of homogeneous elements under a popular Governmnent. That Act wFas disapproved by th H3ome Government as being founded upon reasons which did not truly apply to a country in the peculiar podUton of British India, and the Indian Government of the day was Severely censued for having pased it by your hon. Court, in your defpatch dated the 1st of February1 1836. Your hon. Court, although abstaining from the extreme measure of immediate annulment, direteid that the Act should be reconsidered, in order t. -its repeaL. Lord Auckland's Governmnent, howrever, to wfhom those instructisons were addressed, represented what they conceived to be the evilS of a revocation of the liberty wrhich had been granted, and thereupon the law wasalslently allowoedby the home Govern. ment to remain in force. "3. We think that upon the present occasion the arguments of Sir Thomaa Munro and of the home Government of 1836 contain matter worthy of consideration, although we do not wfholly go along with them. But we desire your hon. Cour to undersad tha it Is not because of ny con. currence in the opinions of wthich Sir Thomas 31unro may be considered as the representative, or in those by w hich tha home Government of 1836 was actuated, that wfe thought lt our duty to ask thce Legislatve Council to pas the tempo. rary Act owv alluded to. In taldug this stepwle acted In complete accordance wFith the opinions of every member of Sir Charles Metoalfe', Government, wvhich pased, and of Lord Auclkland's Government, which supported, the Act for the freedom of the press which has nowr been temporarily suspended. If the suspensIon of that law be objecedt0do, we claim no more than to be judged by the principles laid dowan at the time by the membcers of the Indian Government who passed and supported it. " 4. In laying upon the council-table the draught of the law in question MKr. Macaulay, who prepared It, recorded a mianute containing the following passage :-' One argument only has been urged in defence of the present system. It is admitted thatt the press of Bengal has long been suffered to ueoy practical liberty, zad that nothing hut an extreme emergency oould justify the Government in curtaiLing that liberty; hut it is said such an emergency mayrarise, and the Government ought to reta in in ts hands the powfer of adopting, in that evant, the sharp, prompt, and decisive measures wrhich may be necsar for the preservation of the empire. But wrhen we cons.der with wfhat vast pow/ers, extending over all classes of people, Parliament has armed the Governor-General in Council, and, in extreme cases, the Governor-General alone, we shall probably'be inclined to allowr little weight to this argument. It seems to be acknowledged that licenses to print ought not to beretfused or with. drawrn, except under very peculiar circumstances. And if peculia.- cironmstances should arise there will be not the smallest diiiiculty in providing measuresadaEpted to the exigency. No Government in theoworold is better provided writh the means of mueeting extraordinary dangers by extraordinary precautions. Five persons, whfo may bce brought together in half an hour, wvhose delibeerations are secret, who are not shackled by any of those forms which elsevwhere delay Legislative measures, can in a single sitting make a law for stopping every press in India. Possessing, as we do, the unquestionable powver to interfere, whenever the safety of the State masy require it, wgith overwhelming rapidity and energy, wve surely ought not In quiet times to be constantly keeping the offBensive form and ceremonial of despotism before the eyes of those whom, nevertheless, wfe permit to enjioy the substance of freedom. It is acknowvledged thlat in reality liberty is, and uught W he, the 56°en1 T..1..a , the rare end temporaryf exception. Why, then, should not the form correspond with the realityt Why should ouz lawrs be so framed as to make it appear that the ordinary practice is in the highest degree oppressive, and that free. dom can be enjoyed only by occasional connivance lr "5, Sir Chanes MIetealfe, then Governor-General, by whom the measure had been proposed to the Council, recordedi a minute in which he expressedi his entire agreement w,ith Mir. acuLay's reasoning. In this minute he said, 'I do not apprehend danger to the State from a free press, but if the danger to the State should arise the Legislative Council has the porrer to apply a remedy.' "6. MIr. Pricsep recorded a mninute oi a Still more guarded character. He raid, 'The Governor-General has summed up so very clearly the arguments for repealing the existin lawsg for licensing and restraining the press that I have only to subscribe my entire concurrence in them. But I do not go quite so far as to say broadly and wfithout reserve that I do not apprehend danger to the State from the press of India being free. I see no imme. diate danger in the present state of things, nor is the future danger such as the existing laws would provide for better tha lawrs made specially for the purpose when the danger threatens. Therefore I cordially assent to the repeal of the laws; but I think the eye of the Government wrill require to be kept continually upon the press, and especially upon the native press, for it is capable of being made an engine for destroying the respect in which the Government is held, and so of undermining its powver.' Agin, hlr. Prinsep said, ' If there were doubts whether upon the repeal of these Lawrs the Government could obtain the registration of newrspapers when the occasion for interfering mighit arise, I should he the last to consent to any abandonment of what had been gained. But none of these formusare necessary nowv, for, as is forcibly put by hlr. Macaulay, the LeIsative Council has but to decide, and a lawf suitable to any emergency can be produced in a day'2 and finally he said that he assented writhout scruple to the repeal of the then existing press laws, 'leaving future measures, so far as concerns the security end protection of the Government against the press to be determined hereafter as circumstances may arise to call for Legislative or other interference.' "7. Er. Ross recorded his agreement in the raAsons stated by Mrr. Macaulay end the Governor-General, although he did not participate in certvain apprehensions felt by MSr. Plrinsep. "8. Colonel Monison went further than his colleages, in insisting upon the necessty of retaning the pow er of controlling the press upon an emeergency. He wfould have reta,med that pow er in the hands, not only of the ILegisla. ture, but also of the several local Governments;* he said ' I could wfish, howrever, that the propoeed draught should ptovide some mevans of applying a speedier remedy to the abuse of the press in any emergency wehen the Governor-General might be sabsent from his Council, or wvhen there might be an urgent necessity for the Governmnent of any of the preeL. a_ AAA sA ,,, .,, _, ..the eio esto act without the delay of a reference to the Govenor-Geneal of Inda in Council.' Alluding to the minute of Sir Thomas M unro above cited, Colonel Morison remarked that he wma deeply impressed with the wisdom and foresight of that eminent perron, that he thought his opinions-on this subject deserving of the graveat oonsidera. ion. Colonel Morison wrote,-' What he (Sir Thomas Munro) mos. apprehended was the effect which would probably be gradually producd (by a free press) on the rainds of the native army, and I oonfoss I am not free from the same apprehension.' " 9. On Colonel Morison's suggesion Sir Charles Met. calfe wrote as follows :-'The power of providing for the safety of the State is inherent In the Legisture and the Government of every country. It is not probablo that the safety of the State would be endangered so suddenly by any 0oeratlons of the press as not to afford time to the Ltals- tive Council to apply a remedy, but if such an extreme case of sudden and Imminent danger can be conceIved, whmt Government would hesitate to protect itself until the Legis. lature of lnda ooud provideforthe caSe ?' " 10. When the law, in eousequenoo of the strong dIsap proval of the Rome Government, cmeo to be reconsidered, Lord Aukl nd recorded a minute, in which the following passge occurs :-' The trog arm of authority might before the passing of this Act hays bee put forward to chek anyexcess, ndnow, ihould the of tho sotateever demand such a course, in a single hour a law may be pemed to stop or to control every press in India; nothing has been lost of usful power.' " 1L Sir Bary Fane, the Commander-ln jhiof of that day4 zv oid hia fuH1 cozazcureQ i tah opi*A gxprps4d by Lord Auakdand in the pgraph from which the *boveo quotation in made. " 12. In the courso of these disoussions the opinion of Lozd William Bentinek upon tho queetion of the Indian press was alluded to with approvaL That statkAau, wbose liberal sentiments re well known, in a minute upon this question, written when the lioensing law was in foroo, on an ooan when he exerised the power of control given by that law, wrote as follows:-" I retain my former I opon, that the liberty of the press is a most useful engine in promoting the good administration of the country, and In some repects supplies that lamentable imperfection of control, which from local position, extensive territory, and other causes, the Supreme Council cannot adequately exercise. But I havo always' said and thought that as well with the liberty of the press I as of the subject It Is indispensable for the safety of the empire that the Governor-General in Couneil should have the power of suspending the one and of transmitting the other, whenBver the safety of the State should call for the exercise of such authority.' " 13. We apprehend that your hon. Court will peroeive, from the minutes above ditod that the poesibility of a time of danger oocurring, whon soma measure giving the Governmeat a power of extraordinary oontrol ever the press might become neooessary for the safety of the State, was steadily kept in sight by the framers and supporters of Sir Charles Metalfe's law, and that those gentlemen, even when arguing to the best of their power in fAvour of the liberty of the, press in India, in the ordinary stte of things, were careful to recognize, not only the right, but the bounden duty of the Govermment to suspeud that liberty on the occurrence of certain emergencies " 14. We cannot doubt that your hon. Court will see in the present critical state of affairs an emergency of the nature contemplated by the Governments of Sir Charles Metcalfe and Lord Auckland; and ono, it maybe oonfidently asumed, very much graver than was thought in 1835 to be within the range of probability. " 15. uTpon this point agreelng entirely with Lord William Bentinck, and the mombers of those Governments among whom were satesmen of great eminence, remarkable for the liberality of their general viows, and others of long exporience and high reputation in Inilan affairs; believing that the unregulated freedom of the press at the present crisis ws tending strongly to the extension of revolt and the weakening of the British power; and being confirmed In this belief by the opinions of offioers of the highest character engaged at the moment in distant provinces in supporting tho British cause, we could not besitate to ask for such a law as had been in a mnner preconoerted, when the Indian press was freed, for extraordinary occasions such as thA which has now too certainly arise We re well aware of the angry and unrasoning opposition whlch a restrictive mneasure of this sort will always call forth; but the safety of the country is the one great object we have to look to at present, and to this all other considerations must give way. " 16. The oonditions which we prescribed to the press; while this temporary Act is in force, are, we believe, as mild as is possible consistently with the object in view. " 17 We thought it right to attempt to make no distinction between the English and the native press We agree with Sir Charles Metoalfe, who in the course of the discussion of the prass question in 1835 wrote:-' I think that in all our legislation we ought to be very careful not to make invidious distinctions between Europea and native sub. jectsz' We do not clearly see how any distinction of the sort could be really carried into effect, for there are now more than one newsper in the English language written, owned, and publlshed by natives, almost exclusively for circulation among native readers; and, although we have no fear that treasonable matter would be designedly published in any English newspaper, we have to guard in these tlmes against errors, indiscretion, and temper, as well as against intentional sedition. " 18. The quarter of a century which has passed since tho Press Law of 1835 was enacted has made a remarkable change in respect not only of the number of native newspapers published, but also in the effect, direct and indirect, upon the natives of matter published in the English papers, when the subject interests their pasdons; they make little or no distinction between sentiments affecting them published by independent Englishaen in English papers, and the sentiments of the English governors of their country. Whero their fears are excited or their feelings offended by such publications the hatred thereby excited turns upon the English Government; and even if It could be right at any time to disregard such results, it would be madness to do so at this moment. "19. The interest which matter published in English newspapers excites even in foreign native Courts is, perhaps, not so fully known in England as it i in India Our connexion with the Burmese Court is not of long standing, and the King of Ara would seem to be as far out of the wy of the press as any potentate with whom we have any relations at alL Yet not many months ago a gentleman in our interest at Ava complained thAt he had been oompromised by an ,Uala tbat had been nublihed In a Calcutta newspaper; and It then appeared that bis Burmese Majesty sna sue var cutta papers regularly examined, and matter of interest therein contilned regularly explained to him. "20. To show that the necessity of controlling the English as well a the native press is not merely imaginary, It will be onough to stato that the treasonablo proclamation of the King and mutineers of Delhi, cnn"ingly framed, so as to Mndame the MahomedAn population asmuchasposdble against the British Government, and ending with th assurance that the multiplication and circulation of that document would be an act equal in religious merit to drawing the sword against us, was published in a respectable English newspaper of this town without comment. For doing the very same thing, with oomments having the outward form of loyalty, the publishers of three native Mahomedan papers in Calcutta have been committed to the Supreme Court to take their trial for seditious libeL " 21. In connexion with this subjoet we have the honour to request the attention of your hon. Court to the communications from the Madras Government, embracing minutes by Lord Harris and other members of the Madras Government, touching, among other things, upon the expediency of restricting the existing license of the press in the Madras Presidency, both English and native. " 22. Having taken this opportunity of explaining gene. rally and at length the reasons for whioh we think the tem. porary Licensing Act necessary, the objects which we had in view when the Act was passed, and the spirit in which we propose to carry it into execution, during the present critt. cal state of affairs, we proceed to report two cases in which we have thought it our duty to act under the authority which this Act gives us. " 23. The first of these is the case of the Friend of India newspaper. This paper, after the conditions imposed upon the press had been promulgated and a license subject to those conditions had been granted to it, published an article which, in our opinion, infringed every one of those con. ditions. The position of affairs at the time was most anxious. The Bengal Native Army vas in mutiny; the North-Western Provinces were for the moment lost; the King of Delhi and our treacherous Sepoys wero proclaiming a new empire; small bodies of gallant Englishmen were holding out for Government in isolated stations against fearful odds; the revolt was still extending, and the hearts of all Englishmen in India were daily torn by accounts of the massacre of their brethren, and the massacre, and worse than massacre, of their women and children. Of this disastrous and extraordinary revolt the onlyone of the causesthat isquitecertaiais what appears to us almost an insane, but what is not the less a rooted and universal, persuasion in the minds of the Sepoys and the people of the North-Western Provinces that it is the fixed design of the British Government to interfere by force with the religious liberty of thlu puoplO. In this yitiuvu of &alrs It appeared to us that we should fail in our duty if we per. mitted a nowspaper to inflame men's minds against the British Government, to excite suspicion and unfriendly feelings in the minds of native chiefs in reations with us. and, above all, to Intensify the prevalent ad fatal delusion as to dggs on the part of the British Government to de. stroy caste and to convert the natives of India by foroe and fraud. We therefore warned the publsher of this paper that a repetition of such breach of the conditions would be followed by the revocation of his license. Instead of profiting by this warning, the next issue of the paper contained an article repeating, but in offensive and defiant terms, the sub. stance of the article originally objected to. We were on the point of recalling the license of this newpaper, when we received from the friends of the proprietor an assranoe, rn which we placed reliance, that arrangements had been oompleted under which in future the paper would be conducted in conformity with the prescribed conditions. As our object is to obtain the neesay security with the least possible injurY to private interests, we have on this absurance abstained from the withdrawal of the lioense. "24, We have revoked tho liense granted to the pro. prietor of a lithographic prees in Calcutta, and directed the asizure of all the printing materials, &c., belonging to it Our reason for taking this step is, 'hat in the GW4shun,r eVau Behar, a Persian newspaper published at the pres inr question, there appeared on the 21st ult. two articles of a grossly seditious character, obviously designed to e te disaffection towards the Government and to encourage redst. ance toits authority.

CABDINAL WISEAN OJ INDIA. In the Dublin Freeman's Journal of Wednesday last we find the follnwiig remarks published as " Extracts froma a Dihoourse preahed m St. Jahn's Cathedral, Salford, on Sunday morning by his Eminence Cardinal Wisema on behalf of t ,Manrcheater and Salford Catholic Orphan Asylum : "- "But, now, brethren, let usoomemore closely totthecir. cumstances in whioh we are placed. We are.looking anxiously forward to to-morrow, for we know hot what hewsw it may bring us concerning our immense Indian empire. We'd. not know-we trust, we hope, we pray to God hat we may have eceived the worst, and that we may not have to mour over greater lomes, but, on the contrary, torejoice that a victory, though It will be blood-itai4e4ln our annals, may ave put an end to dismal suspense. It may, indeed, be thus; but, under existing circumstances, the aspect of affairs I8 most serious. Now, trace what hu happened to ia stated souroe. If the accounts that have been given to us be true, this eems to have been the cause of. our present calamities-we have been for a hundred years stfiving to civilize an insiense population - to civilize it In every way except by Christianzing it. \n the contrary, {he very basis of all ou efforts to attach those millions andmilhons of poor l4Mdoos to us has been the promise that we will not maake th m Christians. I will not examine this principle; it is one which has been adopted, and upoon that we have acted. We have told them again and ain, 'No, we do not desle you to be Chrlins.' If not those express words, others as strong have been used. ' We do not wish you to be Christians; remain heathes as you are, provided you are faithful subjects of our Sovereign, and provided you serve us in our eat end of worldly advantage.' Be it so. We have made the atteipt to civilizeaocording to gur mya tern; bnu inone point only have wesucoooded inm gtheun adopt Ei!ropean methods ad skil, and that is in the art ol war. V e have succeeded in making themsoldiers-wo have taught tl,em all the secrets of w aree have tained and discipliedthemunder our best cfcers, and have made a powerful army. At the same tWe, as I have said, it has been un'der the condition of not mang the taslightes approeol tow winning their consoiences or their heart to God, Now, what happens? Just observe bow small a cause Lay lead to great result. If the apcounts which we have read be true-and, certinly, they have been repeated, if not oqnfirmod, down to yesterday-it seems that so far did we corry that dedre to make, thepn goo4dAn powerfo, soldiers that the very last arms that had been invented have been put into their hands - and connected with this was the necessity' of maldng ue oitbome unctnoui substance in preparing the chage for use.

And really upon this dishonesty for a tri-for this miserable gai-wrhich -some one or other hls made, we have had 93,O men thrown 'into rebellou - we have had offices murdered in cId blood by their own soldiers; -we have had men, women, nid children butchered in the most brutal manner; we have had a large resdqnoy thrown into a stato of rebelion; we lave the,inhobitants of our great cities trembling for their lives; and we know 4lot what to-maorrow may bring us of further dismnay. All this may be the result of one petty commercial attempt at unjust gain. See, then, howr smalla commercialme may produee an immense bational dissrte~, and may ~poaibly rob ua of an empire. Is it not, then, the interet of every ore to estblish the standard of commercial honour on such a footing ua that no man should dare to violate the sred law of his stewardship1 In this case you see what It has done. God as yet only Inows what will be the result. And yet, does it not read to you, my brethren, as if the Almighty spoke to the nation in soma way, and said,. ' Give an account of your stewardsthi in that vast empire? Does not everybody say so? Do not the oigans of public opinion ory out, 'The time is come for a thorough reform or our system of government in India?' It Is necessry that we should read and study past events, and see if we have been governing this nation justly andrighteously a became a Christian people. It has come home to the nat'onal consCience that tis is the case, and I have endeavoured to point out where your duty i, and what course of conduct yOU should adopt, to prevent such calamities; for if every ClASS were to do the same there is na doubt we should not have those abuses in distant colonies which lead so often to rebellion, and at length even to separation. And now, while I am speaking of India, our vast mercantile empire, allow me to oome nearer home in the question of national justice. I dare say some of you have seen yesterday an interesting extract from the life of a late illustrious general, Sir Charles Napier-a life published some time ago, in which he clearly foretold that our Indian army wrould rebel; that it would rise up against its officers, those few English ones that remained; and that the East India Company, whom he had wrned again and again in vain, would feel thb disastrous consee,uences of such an event. Such was his prophecy,and he concludedi by saying -' But I do not wilsh to lead the life of Cassandra, glivng nothing but evil auguries to people who ill not takenotice of them.' Now, as these words of that great man a he showed himself always in India, have come thorou6gly to pass, Iwill quote some other words of his spoken to myself, and you will see to what extent they agree with ihose. A few sears ago-the year before his death-I was in the Exhibition ia London, looldng at a picturerepresenting one of his battles, in which he was m the very oentre of dangerl the most conspicuous object amid the terrors of the Sgnt. Standing close to It was the hero of the 9t Sir Charles Nagler himself. It was impossible to e lM; c ut Ae Craes 'w DO lUIUrtKM TO me. I asked him a few questions about the picture and Its correctness, and he then took me by the arm and drew me aside; there were several persons around us, and he said " Cardinal Wiseman, you Catholics are shamefully treated in IndIa, Ihave told them again and again-I have told the Government thsre-that a time wvasconing very soon when, to save our empire, we should require to be united combined forces of allBritish subjects without distinction and that It -was their duty to prevent any disunion or anyrel?gious differences. I have spoken in vain; they will not lsten tome, and they are keepiLg up a system of disunion and separation instead of union. 'i have been again and again ashamed whez in India at being thanked by the Catholics as for a favour for what was but a piece of commonest justice.' These are nearly the very words which he spoke to myself, and I can vouch for the truth of evory expression. Here, again, he foretold the events which have come to pass, and declared to me that the time was approaching when it would be necessary to unite all, without distmotion, in a combined effort to save the Indian empire. Yet, what has been done by its rulers ? Every regulation by which.Catholics can be made to feel that they are a distinot class, that they are not to expect the same treatment as others, is stil continued or rather strengthened It is almost imposible for,a Catholic soldier to have his children educated in his owvn religion; and what is more, if he die he can hardly reckon on their being brought up in it, so one-sided are the rules for the education of orphana So that a poor Catbolic has to fght their battles, has to go into peril of his life with this feeling-either he has sent his child, gainst his conscience, to a school where he will be tanght error for the sake of that trifling remuneration which he could not otherwie gain, or elso that he has given his child no education, and is going to leave him an orphan in the hands of those who will only educate him contrary to his wishes and convictions. Is this fair? Is this public justice? Is this the stewarsdship proper to a 8reat national corporation, which has emphatically and publicly declared to its very heathen subjects that it knowrs no difference of religion lii those who faithfully serve ltl It may recognise a specilic chutrch,lt may have a hierarchy,whlchkeepsit wellenciawed; but, surely, in matters of education and in furnishing means for the exercise of relgion it is boatd that there ought to be no distinction. Yet even in the face of danger it is deemed sound policy to carryon such ptty persecttion. Catholicshave shown themselves as loyal andasaready to shed their blood as any other of the Queen's subjects; yet there everything seems done to make them disaffected, by trying to make them feel that they have not the same righ;s and consideration as others. God be praised there is no fear of disaffectien on their part however unjustly they may be treated, and if you shall hear of battles in India you will find that Catholic men and Catholic regiments will be as forward in every risk and peril as any others; you will find that these paltry acts of injustice cannot in any waT affect their loyalty, or in the slightest degree damp their patriotic ardour. But is it not foolish as well as unjust to act thus, and, in the very country in which the assertion of perfect religious li is proclaimed to the pagan, show him that it Is not &owed to fellow Christians? And now, my brethren, before travelling nearer home, let me suppoe a case to occur in those distant provinces ef ours, Let us suppose that the present isurrection is well subdued and that pece is restored. Bet there can be no doubt this rebellion 1hs its chiefs--those who have silently circulated throughout the whole of, at least, one presidency, and perhaps more, evil principle o e, and have organized multi- tudes, not merely for rising up to amert somirlghtu, but for the total overthrow of our empire, and for the cruel massacre of every one who is naturanly in opposition to their desgns- Let these, by G 's mercy, be prostrted, and tranquillity be restored by what they may call a foreign force, Yet the chief promoters and planners of the rebelion may escape unhurt Let us, then, suppose that these have taken refuge in the States of eome neighbouring but weak Power-of one of the princes who surround our torritory-and that they arenot only sheltered but welcomed with applause, sO that they hold public meetings, where they are called the true friends of India, and subscriptions are openly made there for future attempts upon our British provinces. Let us suppose that there a press Is open to them, at which they mrny print their inflammatory tracts and mcendiary speeches, to be scattered over all India; thAt thence, without hindrance, they may desptW arms and ammunition into the heart of the country; that there they may freely plot and - conspire agabist the peace of our distaat dominions, thence' may depart without dlsuie, andenter our territory organized again for another rizing, another masnare of straugers, and there, if bafiled, aginl take shelter, ready to re-isue, whenever the time is ripe, for a third or fo insurractionNow, I ask you, my brethren, are you, as people of this country, or isanyJ Governent prepared to permit tbhis? np. posing the sheltering nation to be a weak Power, whom we could at once subdue or overcome, do you think we ahould tolerate such policy ? Ihardly thin wre should be satisfied with the asuwer that It was only a politil and revolutionary movement oni the pat of mon who wanted Independence, and that they had a right to seekc it; that they had been, indeed, nsucoselsful, but that theirs should be considered only a political crime; that they were refees, and that the honour and the oonslittson of the protecting nation demanded a liberal treatment of them; adding a boast that they.were too strong in their national stability to fear simiLar dangers, WVould this be toleratedi, wilth probably another rising before us, in which the use of the to oan te poniard was freely recommendad, and the Dtbl gT 7gty aFggvit forbldeaz aSII in yag auNWdpated? Would not the whole nation rise indipnaLtly at the idea that a handful of aeeaed &s rd, rooeive klter trom a week Power, andwe permit them the full liberty of annoying and attacklng us wrhenever they plesed ? No, it never would be permitted. Even at the cogt of a wa-n we would tot allow eueh. refog. to asasin. And this deter. milnation would be Applauded, independent of all considerI atlons of revoling atrocities tomnmftted by the rebels It would be taken In connexion with the mere smed mutiny and attempt to overthrow our empire. Let us, then, fairly apply to others the principle that would be followed it our own c..e.
MR. HBNLEY ON THE INDIAN MUTINIES, On Thu sd last the annual ploughing matches of the Thame Agricutural Assoiation took place at Thame when aboat 40 teams competed for the prizes offered by the soclety. In the evening about 130 memaberg of the asociAtion sat doiin to dinner at the Spread Eagle Hotel, under the presidency of Mir. W. H. Wykeham of Tythorp ark. he cloth baving been drawn, and ti usual loby toast. The CHAIRT proposed " The Health of theMembersfor the Contmtyof Orord, Mr. Henley, Mr. Harcoort, and Colonel N orth," which was drunk in a rapturous mnner. Mr. HEnLEy, on rising, was loudly cheered, end, after apologizing for the absence of Mr. arcourt from indisposition, he proceeded to remark that questions of a social natu which in ordinry times and under ordnay circumstances they were desirous of pro. moting, were now,he would not say altogether passd away, but they were entely overshadowed by matters of more tirring lnterestwhih had recently ocured, for there was scrcely any class of society, however high or low their position ilife, who had not got some friends or acquaint. aences in Indua, or who had not, at all event, some interest fn the dredful struggle which was going on n distanoe of14 000 miles from this eCoUttJ. The proudest eapire waich this, countr could boast, which she opunted among herextenvedomidons, ws he emcpire of India. In that vast Nniniola there were some 200,000,000 of human b6ags differing frm ewch other in race. in religion, and in, habits andpl ar ts, all of whom were for'a long time living systeuatialTy nd oountentedly under British rule, and, although great fault might be found at the maner in which tie country had been governed, and complaints made tbat more hWd iWt beei dote forit, he believed that our rule had been d,4u6tive of ip grestanmount of security for life and pro. th4 thqre ha4 been much less wrong of any sort or the period of British rule in Iada than theih-6 tory of ann'preceding times could show In that oountry. ( mheers.) Tle'iations of Inidia were actomed to be go'erned by the sword, and he (Kr. Henle ) believed that it was quite finqossible tllt the'eoulld be altogether gorerned upon the same prlnelp,e And in theame way as ire governed onrelves lLi thu rountrT (hexr,hear , although the people of this country were apt to compln that the hban was too lea:y, But the evehts which had omccrred in India had tAket the wisest and bestmen by surpri Ther found the native a!=7 of fsbm 80,000 to 100,000 men, well paid, well eared for, iid WeU Vensloned, drifting away without Any' lkiowi reasot-forhe belived it was now acknowledged,oon all hands that.thepleaof She cartridge was only a pretence.

(Cheers.) He ventured to say that every one taroughout the length and breadth of the land felt it was only due to their fellow-subjects in India that if the 30,000 or 40,000 men who had been sent from this country were found insafficient to set matters straight, even larger numm bers should be sent, and, if necessary, 100,000 more should follow in their steps to redress the grievous wrong that had beenuninicteduponthem. (Loudcheers.) Amatterofthat, importance mnst throw all social questions into the shade. The queston whether 10. or 81. householders or other persons should have votes mnst iak into Insignificance when compared with the revolt in India, and he hoped that qnes tion would not be considered uztil they could see their way clearly through the difficulties which beset them. They had a mighty wrong which ramst be redressed. It was not a question whether Indi& was governed in the wisest and best way that human ingenuity could suggest. But no man, in his opinion, oould pretend to say that they had any wrong or grievance ata to oomplain of. It was possible that some of the native princes might feel aggrieved, but for the men who had taken our pay, who had sworn alle4ianoe year after yea to our t3overeign, to turn roand and slaughter in the most crnel manner our helpless women and children, it *as a thing which every man with English blood in his veins would say must be effectually. put down. (Cheers.) He (Mr. Henley) was not one of those who was impatient to put down the vagabonds who had joined m this revolt; vagabonds they were, for the first thing a vagabond did when he wanted to do anything wrong was to let loose all the thieves and cutthroats to help him (lau hter and cheers), and aid aud assistance of those who wero as great raacal sa themselves The first thing these mtineers did was to liberate 3,000 or 4,000 rscaLs from ourggaols. (Hear, hear.) As he had always remarked, he was not impatient in this matter, bat he hoped the mutineers would remain in Delhi until the month of October or November, when the rein. forcements hcdarrived, and they could be all punished together (laughter and cheers), instead of their being allowed to walk ont of one of the three sides (for he believed It was a three-sided city), while we walked in at the other. (Re. newed laughter,) He had no doubt if they remained there, that when the troops arrived they would soon be able to give a short account of them, It would be a great misfortune if the rebels were allowed to obtain a temporary success, and when our troops got into Delhi for the mutineers to walk out, because they would then be in a position to give us more trouble. He thought Is was a fortunate thing that the rebels all fixked to Delhi, instead of spreading themselves over India, because the experience of all of them taught them that if they wanted to kdll vermin the oest and most effectnal planwas to get them into a corner, (Laughter.) He was therefore not at all diappointod that Delhi had not been taken, and aegarded It as a guarantee of a more permanent gascess. ith regard to the resources of this country, he thought they were equal to ten times the pressure which the present state of India would make upon them. They had had greater difficulties than that to contend with In times past, for sach was the sp'rit of our countrymen, that it was not until difficulties arose, that they found out wbhat an Englhshman was made of. Durg times of prosperity no one would think that Englishmen were so capable of "buckling to," and overcoming all hindraneos; but it was the spirit of Englishmen at all times 'when they were put upon their tria to throw all difficulties and troubles aside, and when they saw the thing was to be done to hang together and do it. (Cheers) That was the spirit which had carried them through ten times greater difficulties than that which exited in India Just 100 years had elapsed sinceo our countrymen won India. England was at the present time three times stoner and more powerful thnshe wastbnshno s vm of c u the,and hemo therefore no doubt that we should win hack that which we had lost, and keep it with still greater security.

Fu-mD FoR. Til RELTEF oF TEE SuFFEEEE iN INDiA.-Yesterday the Lord Mayor received from theEarl of Dalhousie a check for 5001. towards the fund for the relisf of the sufferers by the Indian rebellion. THE SuYFFEREs By THz MuTo-y nT IxD"i-.A public meeting was yesterday held at Leominster, convened by the Mayor, Mir. William Gilkes, for the purpoee Of expressing sympathy with the safferar by the Indian mumtiny, andL raising funds for their relief. The meeting VWa attended by severa influential persons of the town, but was not very numerous. The MAyor briefly introduoed the subject, and the R1ev. T. Westmnorland, the vicar of the town, mnoved a resolution expressive of sympathy, and providing for the adoption of prompt meassures of relief. He described the savage atrocities committed upon helpleI women and children as more barbaroug than any which had ever been heard of and expressed a hope that every one would feel it his dut to give something of his wrorldly substance for thei relief. The Rev. J. C. Napleton secnded the resluttion, and raeferd to the pzotection which for a long period had been secured to the Indian population in consequence of British rule. He reminded the meeting thAt Sir Charles Napier had furiously inveighed agauinst many vices which had sprung up among the offlcer of the Native WnantrY, but he bad been unheeded, and he oqntended that th repraseetatiTes of the English nation in a heathenL laud ought also to b;e the representatives of t'he Christian religon. There was nothing mncompatible with an officer faithfnuly performing hix military duties, andi maintaining the ckaracter and bearing of a Christiani gentleman Such instancew had been met with, and had insured great respect and gratitude. It was therefore, be submitted, absurd to raise the cmy that the mutiny originated in the endeavours of a few officers to maintain the bearing of Christian gentlemen.

" As the Issue of money from the Exchequer in amounts sufficient to maintln a constant belanos In the hands of the Paymaster, on each separate grant or head of werloe, over and above the balanoes in the Exchequer at the credit ef such grants and servioes, would entirely defeat these objects, your oommittee recommend that issuea from the Exchequer shall be made in order to adjust the payments =nder every head of servioe, by plaing eaoh in credit in the books of the Paymster as frequently as possIble, consistently with retaining the smallest cash balance ; and that such n adjustment shall be completely made at least at the lose of every month; that the Paymaster should be reqniredto make up for the Commissioners of Audit Aoounts to the end of every month, showing the balances for or against every head of servioe; and that any provision of the Exchequer Regulation Act of 1834 which may appear to be at varlance with this mode of conducting the public payments should be repeled. "Your committee are eZ opinion that the PaymasterGeneral should oeas to be a political offloer, dischaging his duties by deputy; and that ho should become the acting and efficient head of the Pay-offioe, performing his duties in petson.

DHricrxscy-nrLi& "In the pzesent stae of the law (57th of George IIL, chap. 48), it is necesary that Exchequer-bills (Deficiency) should be issaed to the full extent of the deficiency which may appear on aking up the account of the inoome and charge of the Consolidated Fund to the close of the quarter, lb -b-"x 41XF , oaa-4 r-- - that fund for the subequent quarter Is sufficient to meet all charges without the aid of Deficienoy.bllls6 Under such cIrcumstances, the Exchequer-bills are Issued to the Bank, and re paid off on thesAme day; but although this practke obviates the charge for interest on these advances, tihe money is neTertheless borrowed from the Bank when the punbc service does not require the loan. "Your committee therefore recommend, thatl whenev' the deficiency of the Consolidated Fund for the quarter, or any part thereof, can be directly provided for out of the growing produce of the fund for the following quarter, the issue should be made directly out of the public balance without the aid of a loan, nominal or otherwise, from the Bank. " Your committee further recommend that when actual advances by the Bank become necessary, either for Consolidated Fund services or for Supply servioes, the amount should be placed to the Exchequer acoount without an issue of Exchequer-hills, but upon a requisition to the Bank by the Controller of the Exchequer, and that it be ismued from the Excbequer account by the Exchequer to the public service, as at present; also that the advances should be treated as book debts, and be subject to al the existing providons of the law as to redemptl.io. " In calculating the intrest tobo paid on Deficiency-bilLs, your committee observe that the amount of Exchequer credits undrawn, and the balanoe at the Bank to the Paymaster's account, a not taken into consideration, It would be of advantage If these sums were considered, as well as the Exchequer account; but your committee absain from making any positive recommendation on the subject, as the arrangements subsisting between the Bank of England and the Government must necessarily come into consideration in connexion with the Bank Act of 1844, now under the review of Parliament. "4. ExcREQ-ER-BILLs. (SuPPLY.) "A vote in Supply is taken every year to pay off all out. standing Exchequer-bills; and Ways and Means in Exchequer-bills are granted to provide for such payment. The effect of this arrangement is, that the bills of the cuent year reissued to pay off the blls of the past year, except in those cases in which holders demand payment in money. It has been shown to the oommittee that this annual renewal of Exchequer-bills is attended with trouble and inconvenience to holders, and with expense and rlsk to the publlc; and moreover, that the payment of Exchequer-bills in money out of the Ways and Heans granted for Army, Navy, and other Supply services, leads to complicated adjustments betweenthe money grants and the Exchequer-bill grants of Ways and Means which it appears desirable to avoid. As a seurity to holders, Exchequer-bils charged on aids or supplies may, after the expiration of 12 months from thoir respective dates, be tendered in payment of any of the public revenues, aids, taxes, or supplies-a regulation which has the effect of applying revenue in Its progress to the Exchequer to the payment of debt, Your committee are of opinion that the law as regards thees Exchequer-biLs may b greatly simplified, and they have, therefore, to propose - " 1 That the prdncipal of Exchequer-bills be redeemable out of tho Consolidated Fund in those eases in which the holders can demand payment of their bils in money, or pay them in for taxes under existing regulations; and that the interest be payable also out of the Consolidated Fund. " 2. That the Government be empowered, as at present, to ise new blls in lien of those which may be paid off in money, the proceeds of such bills, howover, to be placed to tho credit of the Consolidated Fund. " 3. That the anual renewal of Exehequer-bills be. discontinued, the billsanning on from year to year, with the consent of the holders, until called in for renewal; that the rate of interest be advertised annually; and that the bils be ismued with coupons for the annusl interest. "5. SYSrDX UroN WMciC4r Pumuc Accou=sSHou5LD "Your ommittee consider) at it is the necesay groundwork of any really important improvementItht the whole of the public aocounig should be kept on an effio(ent, and, as far as practicable, uniform syaten, The evidence given before them by competent witneses has sitisfe4 them that the oommercial sysem of bookk} ping by double entry, wherever it has beon applied in the public dopart saonts, as materiatly aided in introducing order and regu larity in their finanoial transocons, ha fadlatad the audit ef the accounts, ana ha promnted ereet appePriation. The Inspooter of the Audit-e.i. appointd to cheek the appropriation of the naval and militesy 4xpenditere has borne testimony to the oftleasy of the sYstea of aeeount in operation in the navi depaziment, to the succoe- ful =anner In which it has stood the tes of geat xa .

Your committee feel ared tUht whatever new securities may be devised for the faithful appropriation of the public money they wlli be incomplete unless they are awoompanied by a qystem of pmblic accounts founded on the principles they have suggested. " 6. ExT'csIoN OP THP APPROPRWLTION CHE4, A(ND PRS8zNTAATION or AuDTDD Accous To PARXLAmENT. "The ooncurrent audit, or appropriation check, first applied to the expenditure of the gpant for naval serviews in1832,and subsequently extended totheseveralarmy grant, was a new security introdnoed for insuring tbe trict appro. priation of the grants of Parliament. It was not intended to lilit the discretion of the responsible department, of the Execative Government in which it was established, but to secre a revision of their accounts by en independent authority, invested with s dfficient powr of invesiption to detect any miapplication of the votes or any deviation from tho appropriation sanctioned by Parliament. This check now applie to the naval and military expenditure and isreguated by the provisions of an Act (9 and o Vict. chap. 92) pasadinl846 ; alsoto theexpenditure of theoffioes of Woods and Foreste and Public Works; and the Commissioners of Audit transmit annually to the Treasuy, for prsentation to the House of Commons, accounts of naval and zalitary expenditure, comparedwith the granbs, accompauied by rports, in which they direct attention to every departure from the provLisons of the Appropriation Act Your oommittee recommend that this important check upon the application of the public money be extended to the acoounts of the inoome and expenditur kept at the Treasury, to the accounts of the revenue departments, and to the vTrioug acoounts oomprising the expenditure of the votes Sor Civil Services, including Civil Contingenies. For the latter servioe two ccowunts should be presented; one showing the finD payments chared against the vote for Civil Contingencie, and the other showing a blancood ccount of the transactions of the year, inoluding the outstauding adances at the doe of the year, ard the balanc3 unismued brought down to the foliowing yr. These a- toun to be preeented for the past year along with the est. MAte for Civil ContVngsencl for the current yer. Your committee are sleo of opinion thAt the wiole of these . counts, finally audited, should, be presented to Parliament before tho close of the year nsuceeding that to which they relate. " In order to strngther the check upon the Gorernment In regard to isues of money, for any service whatever in exceas of the.x u votedby-Parliament, your committee recommend that all payments of the Paymaster-General shall be checked from day to day, in the departments in which they are authorized or made, by an officer to be appointed by the Commissioners of Audit; it will be the duty of this offoer to follow from day to day the appropriation of every payment to its proper aoumt, and to report im. mediately to the Commissioners any exoess of the vote Sinctloned by Parliament, or other irregularity. "And yourommitteefurtherrecommendthatthtse uditod accounts be annually submitted to the revsion of a committee of the House of Commons, to be nominated by the SpOaker. It is desirable that n annual acount of all guarnteed loans, including the payments made and the arrears, if any, due to the Consolidated Fund, ahaU be presented to this oommittee, and that they do report thereon specially to the House. "Your committee suggest that the Audit Board should no longer transmit through the Treasury thoso accounts which they are bound to lay before Parliament, but should com. munioate them direct, and that the appropriation and inspection of army and navy accounts, the selection of officersl orte respetive duties, their removal ordismissal, should rest entirely with the Audit Board. " Your committee has recommended a large extension of the daties and powers of the Board of Audit. If these sug gestions be ?dopted it will be necssy that the c omposition and rolative position of this board, as a great departmentof ths State, should be reoonsidered by the Executive Government. The Board of Audit is responsible to Parlir, ment alone, and the station and emoluments of tho person at the head of it'should be equal to the importanoe of the duties to be periormed, nd not second in rank to any of the permanent officers presiding over other principal departments. `7. Psu-CIPLF UPON WHICH THM VOTES FOR CrL SZE. VICzS SHOULD BE TAKE. "The difficulty which hs hitherto prevented the extension of the principles of account and appropriation check applied to the nval and miltary accounts to the accounts -J *-"nditor,, for (!iMI Bardea L. risen fro=nih..lel,y whtch takes place in Parliament in voting the estimates for Civil Services These votes being passed generally lte in the sesion, it has been oonsidered impossible to adopt the principle applied to the naval and military gunts, of providing only for the payments to be made in the fiancial yar. Your committee are of opinion that this difficulty may be overcome by taldng one aggregate vote upon account for suoh Civil Services as have already been sanctioned by Parliament in the previous session; and, in order to faclitate this practice, it is recommended that All sades for the last quarter shall be payable on the 31st of March in each year. The amounts thus made applicable to each sepaate vote for Civil Services should be stated in Lachedule nd deducted from the amounts to be voted to complete the grants for the year. "A course similar to this has been adopted in the present year, except that the votos have not been limited to the pro. vision required for meeting the payments to be made in the year. " Under this arrangement the accounts could be closed soon after the termination of the year for all home services; and, as regards payments made abroad, immediately on recelpt Of the accounts of payments made up to the 31st of March all unexpended bahlnces should be surrendered; and grants unapplied, but requirod for the completion of the services to which they had been appropriated, sbould be revoted. "1.8. THE ANNUAL AcconNTs OF INCOME AND EXPErSDI- TIRE TO BE FOUNNDED ON ACTuAL RECHIrTS AND PAYMENTS. " It is provided by the Act 10th of George IV, chap. 27, that, for the purpose of ascertaining the annual amount of Eurplus revenue, the Treasury shall caue to be prepared, after the expiration of each quarter, an annual account thowing the actual revenue and expeiditure of the united kingdom in the four quarters for the whole year immediately preceding such quarter-days respectively, according to the actual receipt and issue of,moneys at the Exchequer; and the 24th section of the Exchequer Act (4th of WilliAm IV-, chap. 15) requires that the expenditure in such account, so far as it relates to Great BritLin, shll be made up from the crodits granted by the Exchequer. Your committee are satisfied, from the evidence tak-en before them, that an account of Exchequer credits cannot represent a truo account of expenditure; they therefore recommend that the basis of the aocount should be the actual payments of the several paymasters to whom those credits granted. "9. REOULATION OP THE TREASL-RY Cil EST puNJD. "Full Information as to the nature of this fand and the steps taken to bring it under proper regulations will be found in the Appendix No.3 to the Report of the Com. mittee in 1856, pp. 589 to G13. This fund was formerly known as 'Army Extraordinarieg,' and subsequently as the ' Commissariat Chest Fund.' The' object of the fun,d is to provide the meAns of carrying on the public service abroad. Under exiting regulations la Royal Warrant defines the objects for which it is to be employed, and prescribes that aceounts shall be prepared annually by tho Ce.n mlaloaers of Audit, showing the sum paid into and out of the fund in the finanial yr, and the assets and liabilities of the fund at the close of the ywr. These acoounts have been regularly Iid before the House of Commons snoe the lst of April, 1846. " Your oommitteo concur in the propriety of the regulations under which this fund is administered and the accounts are prepared; but they recommend that, instead of relying on the security of a Royal Warrant for the maintenance of those regultions, they shoula be confirmed by an Act of Parliament. The objects to which legislation should be direckd in regard to this fund are the folloving - " L To limit the amount of the bla te be reined at the credit of the fund, and to provide that if it shall at an time exoeed the limit fixed by law the surplus hli bh paia to the Consolidated Pund. 2.

MONBY-MA-KJT and CIT YIN TELL GENOB Friday Evening. The funds continue to exhibit great dulness, and there has not been a single fluctuationi throughout the day. Consols were quoted 90* to j for money, and 90# to I. for the 1.4th of October. India Stock left oif at 210 to 213; India Bonds, 23s. to 17s. discount and Exchequer-bills, 7s. to 2s. discount. Money was in fair supply on the Stock-Exchange at from 5 to 5i per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bani there was a very full demand. The foreign stock-market was also inanimate, the only important alteration being a slight improvement in Danish. Guatemala were negotiated at 55; Mexican, for the account, 212 ; Peruvian Four-anda-Half per Cents., 79; Spanish Deferred, for the account, 2o5.; ditto Certificates, 6; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 954; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 994 ; Venezuela Four-and-a-Quarter per Cents., 32*; Danish Five per Cents., 101k and 101; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 99g. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate for Hamburg was a trifle lower; for other places there was no material alteration from last post. The corn-market was firm this morning, and a further recovery of ls. was occasionally obtained. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a very active business at an advance of id. to id. per lb. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 80c. for money and 66f. 90c. for the account, showing no alteration. It is stated in the Vienna correspondence of The Times that arrangements are in progress for a new Turkish loan to be contracted by Messrs. Ricardo, of London, and Erlangar, of Frankfort. The negotiations have not yet been positively concluded. The return of the Bank of France this month presents no very striking features. The stock of bullion is now 9,920,000., showing an increase of 120,0001., which is less than had been anticipated, especially as the recent purchases have been large. The position of the establishment has been strengthened by a dinilnution of 664,0001. in the note issues. There has also been a decrease of 740,0001. in the discounts and of 628,000l. in the deposits of the public. In the balances of the Government an augmentation has occurred of 130,0001. Inthe advances on stocks there has been no alteration, and in those on railroad securities the movement has been limited to an increase of 36,0001. The report of the select committee appointed to inquire into the receipt, issue, and audit of public moneys in the Exchequer, the pay-office, and the audit department has been published this morning. One of its mnost important suggestions is that the system of annually calling in Exchequer-bills should be abandoned, and that they should be suffered to run on from year to year with the consent of the holders, the rate of interest being advertised annually and the bills being issued with coupons for the annual interest. It is also recommended that the practice of issuing deficiency bills to the Bank when advances are required should be discontinued, and that such advances should be upon a reqiuisition from the Controller of the Exchequer. The other points relate chiefly to matters of detail and the general simplification of the accounts of the several offices. The advantages which have attended the adoption of the commercial system of book-keeping by double entry in the nava and other public departments are referred to, and its general introduction is strongly recommended. The committee express an opinion that the Paymaster-Generai should cease to be a political officer discharging his duties by deputy, and an extension of the duties and powers of theBoard of Audit is likewise urged. The report of the North of Europe Steam Company has been issued preparatory to their meeting on Tuesday. It gives a further deplorable account of the results of past mismanagement, and holds out lIttle hope with regard to future prospects. Thenew board have commenced a vigorous course of retrenchment ; but it seems as if the chief reliance of the shareholders must be upon the sale of their vessels whenever this can be efifeted. The losses from the 1st of January to the 30th of June last were 38,5291., of which 25,5821. was actual excess of expendituro ovorDa-in. WIo o.4- i.. jt I the date of the formation of the company has been }87,1671. out of 593,7251., and this may be l greatly increased if the vessels should be sacrificed below their estimated value. The meeting on Tuesday, it is said, is likely to be stormy, not from any disnatisfaction with the actual proceedings of the present board, who appear to be doing all in their power to save the property of the company. but from a belief that there has been an undue disposition to screen the circumstances under which the ruin took place. It is to be hoped, however, that this is an erroneous impression, and that each shareholder will be recognized as having the full right of a partner to inquire into every past detaiL L-deed, it is the duty of the Board not merely to allow, but to encourage al such inquiries, and it must also be the wnsh of the former directors that every question connected with their unfortunate course should be thoroughly sifted, so that it may be made to appear beyond all future cavil that they at least stand exonerated from any charge of intentional misconduct. The advices by the African mail steamer Gambia state that the exploring expedition to the river Niger and its tributaries, in charge of Dr. Backie, R.]., left the Brass River for the Niger on the 10th of July, al well. The expedition is composed of 50 Kroomen, 25 natives of the countries bordering on the Niger and Chadda, and 14 Europeans, including Dr. Backie, Lieutenant Glover, Mr. May, and Dr. Davis, of the Royal Navy, a naturalist and a botanist from Kew Gardens, with Captain Grant and engineers in the employ of the contractor, Mr. Macgregor Laird. It is said to be the intention of Mr. Laird to form trading posts on the banks of the river at the most eligible situations for the collection of cotton, shea, butter, and other productions of the interior, provided the climate offers no insuperable obstacles. As by his contract with the Admiralty he is bound to convey deck passengers of the negro race who can read and wvrite English from Fernando Po to all parts below the Niger and Ghadda, it is hoped that a new element of civilization will be introduced into the interior by the return of liberated Africans to their native country in considerable numbers. In the colonial produce-markets during the week there has been no important change, and transactions have been limited, in consequence of the extreme anxiety for further news from the East. The lower qualities of sugar have been sold with difficulty even at Is. to 21. decline, good to fine showing little variation, in consequence rather of the smaUness of the quautity offered than of any desire on the part of the trade to extend their purchases. The crop of Bahia is unfavourably spoken of, and stocks here, as well as in most of the continental ports, keep below those of the former seasou. Coffee attracts more attention, but quotations have not undergone any material alteration. Cocoa is higher. A steady business has been effected in rice at rather better rates for the continent and upon speculation. The London stock stiU continues 'very large. At a further reduction of 6d. to is. in saltpetre more inquiry hm prevailed. To-day, however, the market became dull. Bengal was disposed of during the week at from 47s. 6d. to 55S. per cwt. The recent rise in indigo has been supported, with few parcels offering by the importers. -Tea continues very firm, and in some instances an advance has been realized, but the demand is not active. The public sales on Thursday went off with spirit. The Joseph Fletcher has arrived from Foo-chowfoo with 600,00Glb. of tea. The return from the Bank of England for the weed ending the 6th of September gives the following results when compared with the previous week:- P'ublic Deposits ... £7,087,314 ...

I quite Agree With you that to efect the proposed changs veryrm y obstcles will be last with At everY step, and that the simple ztatement of the question is whether the advantwges to be derived are of sumcient importance to ustitfy a change in a system w1hie has existed for oenturies, and has on the whole been productive of much good, mingled, as many beleve, with oonsiderable eviL The majority of your correspondetLs are desrous of some reform, but great is the diversity of thlir opinions respecting Its aature and extent. The truth is that they viae the sb. ject from very different sading points. Some hv.e been Fellows for a long, others for a short time; some Are members of lage, and others of small Colleges; some have chanced to see the bright and others the dak Aide of the sytem. In my former letter I mentioned the four chief reforms which appear to me to be needed-viz, the abolitlon of the conditions of celibacy, the limitation of tenure, the equalization of the Senior and Junior Fellowshi, and the loosening of the clerical vastrctions. I observe that your two correspondents who do not agree with me are both mem_ hers of Trinlty; hence the objection urged by A " Former Fellow' against my statement that advanta Would be gained by a mn who oould obtain bhi Fellowship ime. distely after taing his degree. At Trnit therc i a Fellowship examination oonducted by the College atuthorities, MA the 'FellowR arn electd 'AerC;ln i° to_tlr _wa1rS tberein and independently of their position in the Univerity Triposes As Boon u A Trinity man hu taken hbi degree he commences a course of reading for thls exation. Hi mInd Ix enlrged by hIs previous tudy, and his subjects are now of much wider range than are touched; upon in the University Triposes. I oca easily understand that he may look back upon thin pert of his sdent life ag that in Which he made the most considerable progres There is also a Fellowshp exAmination at John'; but it Is understood ks be little more than a matter of form. There is anoti pecullaity about these two Colege The Fellowships ae much more numerous than in the others, and therefore vacnes ocur with greater regularity; but, ex,ept at Tinlty, the University Triposes are the stand. ard of merit, and a man who s sufficently high In the clss lists knows that he will sooner or later be elected a Fellow without any further exertion on his pat A vacancy may not occur for two or three yars. In the meantime he sapportc himelf by taking pupils, instad of devoting himself at onoe t3 the study of his fature profesion. To such a man m thli my remark To elucidate my view of the question more clearly I will describe what is too often the life of a CoUep Follow. As an undergraduate he looks upon a Fellowghp as a prize, anod by dint oehard and persevering reading be acquires the requisito mount of classi or mathemLtia After his degree he waitg for a year or two before he obtains the re ward of hss labours. Meanwhile, being without private means, he employs his time in tuition, the only avail. able methodof obtaining a livelihood. At length he is elected; bat he still oontinues to take pupils, As the Fellowshp is too small to support him. Far from being contented with his present lot, he is continually hoping that scme kdnd Providence wil open some new and wider field for the exercise of his talents. The time comes when he must either resign his Fellowship or take Holy Orders, Having no Inclination for the Church, he hesitates; but his apparent interest and the example of others prove too strong; he takes the Irretievable step, and is then made a Senior Fellow. His hope is now to obtain some College pre. ferment and to be enabled to marry. The time at last arrives; he marries, and retire to a country paronage. He diwcovers too late that his old habits cling too closely to him to be easuy sbAken off. He is miserable At home and useleas In his parish. TMs is not an extreme case. With slight variations It is the history oe nu smll number of College Fellows How would the proposed reforms have affected a case like this ? The Fellow described above would have obtained his Fellowship immediately after taking his degree; he would have had sufficient to support him while applying himself to the study of some profession congDenia to his tastes, which would in time have Afforded him an adequate income EHe woula not have been tempted to violate his conscience by biUa f% i l tine of llie I allow that n Instane like tbis is not s often to be met Wi In the two large Collegs. In these the order of merit requlzed of Fellows is much higher than in the others, and hence they are mcen whose talents enable them to make some real advanes in the paths of literature and science; wheres many Of the Fellows of the smaller Colleee, although lian of perhaps more than ordinary capaity, are still tucapible of producing any results by the diret appli_ cation of theiz knowledge At all commensuable with the labour expended. Such men supply the "v egetating" class of Fellows I referred to in my last letter-men whomight be very valuable in the ordinary occupations of life A " Contented FeUow" has quite misunderstood my meaing If he supposes that I would At all undernlue the high talents and attainments of those who hiave devoted themselves to tuition. I am quite aware of the enormous ad vantages which the students of large Colleges derive from the high character of their lecturers; and still to retin the services of such men I proposed in my last letter that College officers should be permitted to retain their Fellow. ships After the expiration of the usual time of tenure. " Resident" cerinly went too far when he stated that "marriage is the one topic of oonversation among the Fellows, and the one object which engages their thoughts! But your " Contented" correspondent goes as far in the other direction. I had never heard before that any brother. hood of Fellows exists in Cambridge of such monastic principles As that he descrlbes. The following appear to be some of their tenets . Marrige is instituted for poor simple folk, and not for philosophic FeUows. 2 It is imposdble for a married man to write a book I am gad they re not quite devoid of all the warmer feelings of human nature, and they can be moved with oompassion when they hear of the melancholy marriage of poor A-. Poor fellow I HeO has got a pretty wife, and a good income. What a blow to the interests of science and literature I " Ex-Fellow" has, I think, given a conclusive answer to tho argumenti that a limitation of tenure would deprive Felowships of their attraction as prizes. I fear I have ventured too far on your 7aluable space my only excuse is that the subject is one of far more general interest than migat At first sight appear. To prove this we haveonlytorecolleo4that upwards of 300 parishes have College Felloi s as their rectors or vicars. Iam, Sir, your obedient servant, A W.KNUXi AND EXPECTANT FELLW. biepLd.Iu TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you allow me a little further space to explain There are few sabjects which require disoussion more, and there are few which have had so little, since the reports of the two oommissiong for Oxford and Cambridge were pablished. I believe it is a great mlstakto sappose that the Fellow. ships aro the main stimulus to work at the University, or tho chief inducement to young men to come there The naSin simulus to work is the certincate of morit which a place in the Honour Lists confers, inclding, as it does, the gratification of ambition, the influenoe of its prestige, and a valuable, and in many cases a neoessary testimonial for future success in life. If the Fellowships were abolished altogether, no cblss of undergraduates would be much affcted or dininished in number, exoept those who purpose entering the law, or some profession of a similar character, and have not much money to spare. There would probably be fewer professional men who have had a good general education, but the other clmsos of undergraduates woula be much as they are now; and this excepted clss of needy would-bo professionals is not a large one at Cambridge. Another class which may occur to some men's minds, composed of persons looking forward deliberately to a Fellowship as the means of spending a life of study, not caring to be married, not caring or disqualified for plaes of higher emoltment, Is so very small that it is not worth considering. Itnamut be remembered that a Fellowship as it now exists, a perfect sinecure, determinable at pleasure, of above 2001. n-year, is not the result of a deliberate purpose in the founder, bat a growth of time, and, like most other growths of time, has, I think, its full share of rottenneas. If a Fellowship has come to be merely a valuable pris- obtained by A few years' exertions, but not necessary to insure those exertions tadng plce, it ought surely to bo limited in duration, amd only renewable if its tenure is no longer sinecure. In other words, all Fellowships should be limited, exoept those whose owners are thereby directly engaged in furthering the main objects of a Qolleg, " the advancement of religionandlearning "andtdese are practicallythe tutors and lecturers. I do not think that College interests require amy other exoeptlons, unless they be the bursar and real devoted rtudeuts, if a smucdently Independent board oould be constituted to judge their clWm. And I think it might. I have sid before, in my letter of Saturday, that if the tlition is to be improved it must be by making the wrorr a profesdon Instd f a pastime I clanot nerstand the aguents Of tho-e who insist that a quLick uooeseon d leturers io desirable. I knou of no othe work In life 1 which prstioe and long atdy are not IndIspensable to rel exoellenoo and riht sucese6. If your correspondents tink the heady, unripe effors Of young men preferable in dt ines of lis, let them refate the wlidespred fallacy which affirms the oontrary; if they eonfine their rule to titlon, let them show how the differenoe &ris. I expect the regi explanation of their views is that they look at the UInier. ;ity, and contrast those who ae hoping soon to leave taition with thoae Who do not expoot to leve it for several yea. If so their experisoe is In favour of my viws. If these fact be correct, why should the ratriction of celibacy be kept up? The taltion srffra by it and Fenows who are not on the tuiton gain only where they have no right to g1ln-vix, by an unduly extended tenure. Tbe prtical Inconveniences of a change would be slight and abundantly oounterbaaced by good. I thinzk it would be derble that the Fenowship of a tutor or lecturer Shool4 be renewed, not merely oon tinued ; but it Is not ential to the soheme. There would be no practical inecrity of tenure as one of your correSpondents eoms to think-perhaps not enough to make even tLe form of renewal worth retainiug. But no tutor ought to contlnue more then three years, and then he might retain his Fellowship s a retiring penion. ayY I add that it is Incumbent on the Colleges to devote some Of their corpoAte revenues to the payment of College lectuers ? Thl was, I belierve almost always intended by the fonnders, and Is now amost entirely neglected. I think many willloern with surprise that no purt of our large revenues, to pek of, is extended in the payment of loctueres. In cmuliui n, even supposing Fellowships to be the grt stimulu they are suppowd ana suppodng the limitation of tenure to diminish their value more than the permialon to aIry could incra it would the diminution sensibly affect the sthnulus ? I think not. I am yours obediently, A FELLOW OF A COLLEGE. C-bridge, Sept. 10.
HONVORARY COLONZLS op MILITl7r.-. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I*At Tuesday's Gtazec proclaims to the world that "the Right Hon. Gilbert John Lord Aveland" Is appointed "honorary colonel" of the South Lincoln Militia. I do not pretand to divino wlho so great a mamnas " the Bight Hon. Gilbert John Lord Avelandl" may be. I cannot find his name In Burke as a peer, either by patent or by courtey. This mouh, however, we knowr,-namely, that, though he may be above the work of a soldier, the attractons of mailitary rank and a gorgeous uniform at Court are not beneath his notioe. Mlitiamen had hoped, Sir, tl*t the absurd and pernicious practioe of noni-a com anders had ceaed for ever. To obviate the difflculty of colonels of militia clashng with lieutenant-colonels of regars, we were told that in hture the commander of a militia regiment was to be Stled Llcutenant-Colonel-Commandant. I know nothing about the County of Lincoln or its militia, but tho Soith Linooln Militia the Army Utells us has a Lien. tenant-ColonelCommandsnt. If he be nsuited for the comra nd of a volunteer corps, or others have greater claims or pretensions, by all means let another be selected for Lieuten,nt.Cdonel.Commandant, and let him remain simply lieutenant-colonel to the commander. I do protest, In the name of common-ne And the militia force at large, against the system of a decoy duck coloneL At firs. sight the appointment of honoaryx colonel would appear a harm. less piece of eocentricity, for he receives no pay. But it is not so. It ig a job. The selection of the officers, which ought obviously to be at the disposal of the Iatu com. mander,virtually resgt with the nominal head of a regiment, whether he be oolonel or lieutenant-colonel commandant, and the dodge is cloearly to keep the patronage in the hands of the Lord Aveland, and to Icave the irksome duty of the orderly room and the barrack yard to lees favoured mortalsI No one can be more alive than the wTriter of this communication to the importance of our mlitia regiments, the offloers of which receive no permanent pay, falling to the Command of men who carry great weight IL their counties; but the appointment of honorary colonels, however high their podtion, has the ver7 worst effect, discouraging gentlemen who are independent of pay from volunteering their Eervice especially in the junior ranks, which cannot so easly be filled up. They cannot be expected to consder it an honour to serve In a regiment merely Stga~ihrjpmo of a rnsn_rith sYwepinUtle and broad voloe remain for ever strange to them. This m system throws the virtual command of a militia regimens, let the truth be spoken-notunfrequently into the hands of some roughmilitary ally of a gret mn, nuder whom country gentlemen and quieter, though perhap3 leso affMent, old soldiers may have never bargained to serve. One by one the best offioera dimppear, to be replaced by others in an in. feriorsocia position, and the regiment deteriorates. Gret lords, in our forefath6rs' time, were not above mustering train bandas and serving in camp and garison. It rested with the pretension and excluivenees of modern wealth and modern aristocracy to be above meeting their fellow justioes and country neighbours, on familiar terms, in a militia mess. room. Shameful instances of sinecure colonels of militia receiving pay at Aldershott Camp in 1856 could be quoted. Three praiseworthy exceptions deeerve special commenda, tion, and may with propriety be mentioned. Colonel the Duke of Richmond, Sue MiliSa; Colonel Lord Lovelace, 2d Surrey (both Lord-LIetkuants of their respective counties); and the late lamented Lord Hinton, 1st Somerset, lived with their offior and were carcely ever absent from their regimente, which they consequently understood and comnanded; and the result w manifest to aIL Lord Ave. land, it Is presumed, Is above such examples. I enclose my name and address, I am aware that I am a very small man, but I understand that about which I write, and, as I have endeavoured to explain myself concisly, you will, I trust, admit this attempt to call attention to a grOss abuse which is seriously injuring the Mlitia ervioe.

INSOLVYENT DEBTOYP'S COUT, Fridqay, Sep. 1L The sittings of the Crirt were resumed to-day before Mr. Comitissioner MuRPI y. I-I RF, JAMES DIGY WVRIGHT. Thisinsolven,t, a4scribed as of no trade or profession, wss opposed bX Mr. Reed for Mr. 'Yeatman, hosier ;:a Regent-street. Several creditors appeared in person, n5a5led Reeves, BontI-ron, Edmistou, and Porter. Mr. Sagood supported. In 15ol t}.e insolvent was discharged under the Act. ae now owecI about 2.0001., and had 103 creditors on his present sc)Ledulc. Ie had been seven months in prison, andI was in a oad state of health. Ae had been a ijeutenant iai the Axt.llery, and, with the exception of two Sears ended m 1b556, v hen he was in the service of the Great Vestern RIaBo-ay Company, he had been in no business or profussiZn. He hadaseistance from his friends, and was entitled to sonc reversionary interest. He obtained hositry goods of Mr. Yeatmna's shopman to the amouint of 181. so ne odd -s'flhingv in the name of Captain Dsgby WA!right. He took apartments at the house of a workinv moan named Reeves, one of the opposiAng creditors, where he had 'five seivants" and wed 4i44l. Mr. Bonthron, a baker, had a trade bill and cashed a mh'.ck of a person named White, who was now in Anstrali. Mr. Edmiston, waterproofer, of 69, :trand, complained thst he got aropeTa glass from him and a waterproof coat; and the other complainant was a washerwoman. On the part of the opposition it was urged that the insolvent had pursued a reckless career of extravagance, and had no reasonable expectation, if he ever had the intention, to pry hIs numerons creditors. Mr. SARGOOD made an appeal to the Court on account of the insolvent's stato of health and the isnDrisonment he had already suffered. I Mzr. Commissioner MuRrITY said he meant to give a long Judgzuut. It -"a X o030 of reckless extrvaugance. He found among the debts one for an ice-pail for his Nvine. He could not eonsider theinsolvent's state of health so as to preI vent hinm passing a long remand. The learned Commissioner gave a judgment of 12 calendar months, renmarkinig that had he not been in prison seven months he would have given him 1S mor.ths' impriEonment. IN BS TUE HON. SUSSX LEPNNOY . This insolvent (Lord Sussex Lennox) applied to be discharged. Mir. Oliver, a tailor in Piccadilly, appeared to oppose. Mr. Sargood supported. An objection wvas taken to the opposition as the debt was inctLrred for clothes, &-c, in 1843, and was consequently barred by the Statute of Limitations. Mr. Comrnissioner MuRpU1y held that 3Mr. Oliver could not oppose. Although a debt was barred, an insolvent was bound to insert the debt in his schedule. The debts in the schedule were 1.9361., and the appearance was partly a-trihuted to his connexion with railway companies. 1-fe had an allowance of 1751. a-year from his brother, the Duke of Richmond. The iusolvent was diselarged. IN B:E JEAN BAPTISTE 'TAURICE BRUN. This was an application for bail. The case was heard be. fore the Chief Commissionar, and the order for hearing was disnissed. MIr. B. Caarten, Mr. Dowse, and Mr. Sargood appeared for various creditors ; Mr. Reed supported. Mr. B. Ci.u.ArEx objected to the application, as ib would not have been granted by the Chief ommissioner.

POLICB. fANSION-nOvSE.- James bIoore, a ferociotus-looking fellow, was brought before the LORD MAYOR, charged with baving bitten off the top joint of the fioger of Ellen Sallvan, the wife of a shoemaker living at .55, Halfrmoon-streeb. The presccatrix, who c,rried her arm in a sling, and appeared to be suifering severe pain, upon bein- sworn said,The prisoner is a strauger to me. Last night, about halfpast 12 o'clook, as my husband was going downstairs to the yard I heard a disturbance between him and the prisoner, and my son went down with a lighted candle to turn the latter ouit of the house. lie thereupon struck my son and tore the front of his shirt off. I went to my son's assistance, upon which the prisoner caught hold of my hand, dragged it towards his mouth, and bit my forefinger off at the top joint. The LORD BIAYOR,-What became of the end of the Prosecutrix.-l Qo n- 0 . The L<uti) MAYOOR.-Did you not find it? Proseciitrix.-Ko, my Lord; we looked for it everywhere and it was not to be found, so I suppose lie swallowed it. I af:terwYards went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where my finger was examined b) the doctor, who did not dress it, on aaccur.t of its inflamed stpte. I aru in dreadful agony, and the pain extends all the way up my arm to the shoulder. I thihk- tlle prisoner had had a glass of something to drink, but nothing to hurt him. The Loi) MA)Yo)r.-1Tad you ever seen him previously to ths? Prosecutrix.-Never; he was a perfect stranger to me. Hs said be had oome to see his father-in-law, who lived on the first floor. 1'risoner.-lIoweame youto put yourfingerinto my mouth when I was down and was being kicked and struck by about a dozen of you ? 1'rosecutrix.-You were not down when you pulled my fi,ger into your niouth. John Salivan, the husband of the prosecutrix, said.- LaFt night, about half-past 12, as I was going downstairs, I fancied I saw the sbadow of a mnan in the corner of the staircase. I said, "Who is there?' and the prisoner replied with an oath, " What do you want to know for'" I said, ' Whoever yon are, you are very saucy." He wvas about to strike me, when my wife and youngest so,n caine to my assistance, and the latter, knowing that I had an abscess on may back and was unable to protect ssyself, threw off his coat and offered to fight the prisoner. About a dozen persons rushed downstairs at the -eane tiule, most of theal undressed, and a regular row ei!sued. I heard my wife scream violently, and beg of the i risoner to let go her finger. A light was brought and 1 san her finiger, which was bleeding profusely, and looked as if it had been gnawed off at the joint by a dog. I never saw thdl prisoner in my life before. Cr -s-vc.aamnind hy the l'xisoner.-I did not know till last nivl- thtat your father-in-law lived on our tirst floor. James SulUivan, jun., the young man alluded to in the foreg,ingevidence, corroborated the statemeents of his father and motber. The pri.oner, in rcply to tile charge, said,-Lst night I went to tee house iu question, for the purpose of seeing my father-in-law, and ju-t as I knooked at bis bedrcom door I the wit-e5s Jnhn Sllhivan eame downstairs, and asked n,c wvhut 1)usinocm I had there. I told bins that that was nothing to him, upon wbich he gave an Iaish howl, antd in an fostant at least a dozen men and woiimen, most of them in their zfightdresscs, rushed downstairs and kicked le aul .ver my body, and junped upon me. (The prisoner had a black eye, and was a good deal cut about the face). The prosec;itrix got her fingers into my mouth, and tried to gag me, and to tear the Ocesh from the roof, and in order to re1-ne lnlmef I1 was obliged to bite her. If my father and mother-in-law had not let nie in I am sure I should have I cen hiVcd. Suveral of the persons who attacked me tried to rip up soy cheeks by puttiug their fingers into may month. The L. io) MAYO.R committed the prisoner for trial upon the elarge of unlawfully wounding the prosecutrix.

Ellen Hogg, a wretched-looking 'omaV between 30 and 35, was charged before Mr. D'EvN- OU'eT on supiioin of causing the death of her male child | r'.d attempting to conceal its body. The prison,er, a tambour. worker and single woman, lodged ,t the house of a Mrs. Anne Patience, in Nicholas-street Few North-road, and had done so for 11 weeke on Mend ,y wvening, when she tomplained of not feeLing well, ancd aid ho should go to bed. A noise was heard in her roomz at 12 ,'lock, which excited surprise, and the prisoner accounted or it next maorning by saying she had c.ught a severe cold I *.nd was obliged to make grueL She was not seen cll Tuesday till nighttime, when she asked to, lava some brandy fetched, and, this ttzacting the, Mandlad)'s attention to her, she noticed that shethen oppeared much attenuated and ill, and, as she had keot her- nelt so secreted she determined to watch her. On Wednes. - Da night the prisoner came qnietly downstairs with somneIbsug bulky beneath her shawl, with which she went ont and Mrs. Patience followed her, and kept her ir sight all the way to Ball's-pond, whlere she at length stopped in a field close to some new buildings, and the witness heard something faU in the field. The prisoner then turned for home, but took a very long and circuitous road, and on both reaching the house nlearly together the witness at once told her she bad, followed her, accused her of omethiog wrong, and threatened her with tho police. The prisoner then, iu great distress of mind, acknowledged that she had been confined on the Monday night, said the child had been born dead, would not say who the father was, but said he coulld not be found, and confessed she had disposed of the child's body, Pnd offered to go and fetch it. The witnest told her husbard when he ea-ne home, and ho communicated with Sergeant Mavrety, of the N division, who at once went to the house, battfouxnd the prisoner had lIft it, aDd betherefore went on to Ball's-pond, but could not find the dead infant. On returning, he found the prisoner crying and in great grief, and on his accusing her of the offence she was now charged with and asking what bad become of the childe she acknowledged the truth of the charge and pointed to the side of the room, vhere the infant's body wa found, w.rapped np in a piece of calico. Sho declared to bin also that the child was born dead, that the birth occurred so suddenly she bad no expectation- of it, and she expressed great Sorrow that such a misfortune should have occurred. Mr. Coward, the divisional surgeon, deposed to exarnining tbe body, which was that of a full-grown and perfect male child; it was impossible to say whether it had bee, born alive or not, but there were no marks of violence upon it, .and the probability was that it had eithr died frmn excessive hnemnnorrhage or been suffocated beneath bedclothes. The pristoner, who was too debllitated to staan at the bar, faintly repeated what she had before stated to the of iicer, and she was remanded.

The prosecutor sd that on Saturday evening, the 22d ult., he went to Thames Tunnel-stairs and engaged a b.at to take him down the river to Rotherhithe. There were two men in the boat, and one rowed.

They went across the water at Bermondroy, and entered a publichuminse, where he treated the men, and after drinking a little ale his senses soddenly left him, and he had no recollection of what afterwars occurred. Ho also had no recollectiou of the prisoners, and wben he recovered his senses he missed the men and the whole of his property. Richard William Reeves, a waterman, said he saw the prisoners come ashomre with the prosecutor on the evening In (inestion, aind they entered the Lion and Castle publichonse, Cherrv-garden-stairs, where the prosecutor treated them all. The prisoners then took the prosecutor to a houIse La Salisbury-street, wben witness saw` John put his hand into the gentlemar's pocket and take out some money. He also took off the ring and put it on his own finger. Charles was standing looking on. Both of theu thens told witness to go and look to the boat, and he lift them. At th:at time tme pros--cuter was sitting in a chair insensible. About half-past 9 o'clock he sawv the prii.s'sers in the Lion and C:ale, and then they quarrelled, when John produced a gold watch and chain, After that they paid him and went awav.

VOLU2TTERS FOR IrNDIA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In Thc Tinzs of Tuesday your Vienna correspondent quotes a passage from the Oestcrrcichische 26tiugn, in which appears the following paragraph:- "It is a remarkable fact that not one band of volunteers has yet offered to proceed to the seat of war." Allow me to contradict this statement by giving one instance, and I am sure it is only one of many within the knowledge of others. On receipt of the first reaUy alarming news from the East, and before one word was said about calling out the Militia, the men of tho South Tipperary Artillery Militia met in large nutmbers, consulted together, and sent a deputation to the senior oflicer in the county to express their readiness to serve forthwith ia India. Tais gentleman, touched by the rude valour of those stalwart fellows, collected the wishes of the officers as well as mcn, and, with scarcely an exception, all agreed to join in tb - volanteer offer. It was made throngh the Colonel in chief to Lord Panmare. I think you will say that this was creditable o rmen living in a county once not very noted for its loyaltv and I can only say, had their sorvices been accepted, that a finer body of men(-S61 strong, and most of theni trained guaners from an 18 months' embodiment in forts and garrison-has never landed in Iadia, And here I must beg of your readers not to confu.e those nen with the Tipperary Lmght Infantry, who mutinied last year at Necagh. The Artillery corps was, I may say, without crime. I fear, however, this volnnteer offer must have somewh..t surprise.i our official red-tapista, and probably annoyed them, becaiuo now that Triah Militia corps are being again embodied, at.d w;hile two Downvnhire regiments are called out, this Tipperary corps bas got leave to stay at home, your mili-ary correspondent being in error in stating it is called out. I)oulVless the authorities are afraid they msight again give two handred tall fellows to the Royal Artill'r", as they did in the late war, al,d that the infusion of Tipperary blood would be too strong in that gallant arm of tho service. However that may be. I am sure you will not refuse to let the public of England and Ireland know that our poorsuffering friends in India had the -y'npathy of the bold w=ointa{reers of MuLnster, and thiat the first volunteering cry was "1 Tipperary to the rescue !" Your obedient servant, TIPPER1E?S1S.
IRON SlTIPS. TO THE EDITOR OF TEIE TIMF.S. Sir,-The same reason which Sir James Liphinstone gives forcontinuing the cotrespondenee-Damely, that the question of iron transport. is one of national importanee-emboldens me to beg you to insert my reply. I was induced, under the signature of "1 M.," to notice Sir James's former letter, because I could not for the life of mue understand why "he should hope that the accident which had happened to the Transit would open the eyes of the First Lord to the defects of iron ships," when i- was perfeetly clear that the same calamity might have happened to a wooden ship under similar circumnstances. But when, in his letter of the 6th, Sir James iElphinstone went still furtber and stated "that he hoped the lues of the Transit will opea the eyes of the Admiralty to the defects of iron transports, and that they will lose no time in disposing of those they bave or converting them to some other use," it appeared to be high time to step in with a hmible protest against such a summary process, by which, among others, such a magnificent ve sel as the Ilimalaya wou'd be disposed of to the great detriment of Her Majesty's service. It is incorrect to say that the Great Britain grounded on smooth sand, for the ship had a rock right through her bottom, which it was necessary to blow up from the inside before she could be moved. lt is also incorrect to Itate that it was an advantage to the Tyne to take the rocks in a slanting direction, for had she struck stem on her watertight compartments wonld in all probability have euabled her to be floated off much sooner than she actually was, with loss of rudder, sternpost, aad 35( feet of keeL I could quote many instances, if it were necessary, where woodan ships went to pieces as quickly as iron vessels ever could. But I do not wish to puff off iron ships at the expense of wooden ones; they both have their advantages, but the wholesale condemnation of iron ships in which Sir James Elphinstone has indulged would, if acted on at the Admi ra.ty, which he has so earnestly invoked, be very injurious, :am persuaded, to the true interests of the public service. I am, Sir. your obedient servant. CHARLES EDWVARD MANGLES. .Sept. IL '
