Naples, March 8, 185 7.BN INoTN.
TO the ELCiTORS Wof the BORIOUGH Of .FINfSBU~Ry Gentlemen,
IHave had -the honour of =!jivnj; a Requisition,
.uiged by 2,012 of your body, to become aL nd~idate tozpon yo to Parliament.
To thin Requislition I haive muchL pleasure in responding, and I seek yo.ur mnufrages because I believe the opinlos of the great majority of
teeletors are in unWiso wlth my own.
I am an advocate for prog"reat and co0plete reform Inl every de. pariment of the State, and having no drea of hinnovationi if well direted I would entirely abohiah laws and customs which have become InapplIcable, inoperative, or poetiveLy miechlesous from lapse of time. change of circumstances, and (in uome Osee) by their own inherent vices.
I believe that the House of Commnons, as at present constituted, does cot reprsnt the people of thi ounntry; eeymaue therefoe
which hs or Its object to make it more competel1 th =ommns
House would recetve mT ardent suppost.
Jn my opinion this object cannot be effected by any single messre We must have the vote by ballot, a shortening of the duration of Parlioments, a large extensIdon of the suffrage, and a re-distributioni of our electoral district.s, which would involve the removal of that anomaly in our present systm, viz., boroughs with constituencIes so small as to make l& an aLbsirdity that they should poses the powr of sending members to our Legis-ative Assembly while large distetsi are totally unrepresented.
By these means we shbould make cur ConstitutIon a reality and the Lolwolbesatisfed that a debate sand decision of the hiouse of vopmnu aslthe expJression of the wil and opinion of the country.
[ would in financild matters insist upon the strictest economy comncpatible with effilciency, and I would narrwly scrotinize evernewnimesa sure with the view of making the burden of taxation fal equally on all clasees, I nieed hardl1y, therefore, say that I should do my utmost to reduce the present enormous Income Tax, which, in addition to the injustice of tin mode of assessment, is levied on Incomes too small to bes It, and presses so severely upon the xaiddle classes, by chawging Incorns derived by the sweat of the brow or thelabonr of the brain (andi therefore precarouts) Ina the smani prportionL and to the samae extent as that derived from realized property.
J;am and alway have bee for free teade, and Idesire towec its priniciples mome uIt developed.
On the important questioo respectin China, which will shortly be submitted by Her Majesty' Govre mment to the oDuntry for decisior
my olpition is that the Government are in the right, and they woula therefore have my mnost strenuous support.
I amifor the entire ahoUition of comtpulsor church rates, and shiall. always be round advocating thude t rncpe of civil and rellioous liberty forall ClaSses, without UntinofW e,denomination, or country.
lam deIru of seeing a complete refourm or abolition of the Boclesatimica Cocrts knowing, asI do, the frightful source of injustice they are to the poor man, and of expense to the rich.

.14axe asked, while you uphold the Church of Engiand, to abolish chaurch-rates, The Committee of Lasmen, at the Present crisis, feet It their duty to bring the folloWing facts and reasons before yonu:-
L The loss ot anual revenue by the abolition of church-rates nm4y be entiesated at £15,80D. It Iisaild that this maay he made up by voluntary contrtbutons, Experience does not warrant this. The churches in Parishes dependeut on voluntary support are many of them miserably nouilected, Whence are new fends to corme, especially in oos.tryplaribes?
2. But why abolish church-rates I Theo answer of your opponents is: because so many paznshes object to levy therm. But, observe, there are about 12,080 perishes In England and WVales. Resurns recently makde to Parliament- from 9,428 parishes, shoaw that out of that numbr-r, 8,274 have not ref~ ad continue toocllect, the rate-onily 415 refuse It. Ot the reminig parIhes, 287?lhav eg aeinn or other source
of support; and 86-many o them town parishes-are maintained by various expodlentg, until the law Is maddelefective. In a few pwabies rates aft only partially collected, while some, who had formerly refused, have subsequently aranited the rate. 125 onsist of replies dietlcult to inderstand. If Among the remaining 2,880 (from which there are no returns) there be any which hare refused the rate, it seems scarcely probable that a return of the fact would have been neglected. If. therefore, In nsinety.five out of every huvdred peariheatbe rate is collected, are 8080 parishes to be desoilled because 405 Parishes In England and Wales refuse? lIsthis reaconable orjust?
S. It is asiked, why not, for the sake of peace, give up chureb-rates? Our replyI&. Bemause we must mak-e previson for the relligious worship of those who rennet provide it for thiemselves But we cannot have public worship vithout churches, nor the ordinances of relidon without siiffcient provison for thera, IC the ob;ect he, to overthrow the Esatblitbed Church. let that obiee- ho avowed. It the Church is to be upheld church-rates should continue.
dnbehal of the COmmittee of Laymen,
JOHN H. KNOTT, Hon. Secretary. 18, Mfancbe4ter.buldidtne,Westminster,March 13.1857.
S, dlety we begrespeetully to address you 00£a subject which, in our
jdgment, ought not to be forgotten at atime like the prescut, when by your vOtes, yon are about to detarmine the character of ournatiou;l px licy for some years to somne. We refer to the principles upon which the native Inhabitants; of our oDlootls em pire should be governed, and the policy wh!ch should in future be adopted to. wards those uncivilzed nations which reside in the immediate nelthbourhood of our oDlonies, We appeal to Mo on behalf of upwards of 180,88D0.80 of our fellow-maen, belonging to diverae races, and ecatteredl over every portion of the babitab e slobe, wroo whilethey are fortte mogt partdirectly mameable to Briihafuthority, and contribute largely to maintain the national wealthi and power, set posess no stare whatever in the piveramenit of their respective countries, and are no0t permitted to en,'or sa representation of any kind in the Imperial Parliament, We claim,therefore, not as afavour, but Las a right-not as an ant of generosity, hotteas the fulfilment of a bi,t demnand-that you, the electoral body of tbe United Mlogdom, shoukld by the votes you are About to secrd, uphold the rights, and promnote thebappiness and prosperity of the native population of India and of the British Colonies
We know how strongly supported our anpeal is by every prinoiple of naturalijustice We know how perfectly itsaccords with that holy religion whkch insteed of laying down doce set of laws for rthe guidance of clnflized men in their relations with each other, and nermutting them to regulate their intescourse with their less-favoured brethren by another, and a different stisodard of mtorality. enjoins as an fmperitfve duty the rendering unto all men of equal justioe, and makes no excep-
linwhatever to the universal application of this law. But our aPpa Ialofortified bY the weightY authority of experience, which h,s tagtu,by many terrible le-sons, the fatal cou .emeeoe, of on,
haig aled to art with honesty eudhumasilty towards our unciTilized felwsbects. We have oooftendisregardedtheirtnatural right ts psestheir own soil, or, at least, such Portions of it au they bare chosen for habitation; and impetuoum And overbearing offidials have too frequentlyemployed what Is des-ignated "~the law of frce Iin the rettlement Of trvialt disputes, which might have born amicably di . poeed of, had the principle of arbitration been resorted to by our represeetativerf or had they acted with becomling forbearance and nisenanDimity.

We believeTthatifthecolonieswere requirdt
to defray the expenses of their own military operat1ons, they would soon discover the waMy to establish friendly relations with the native., and the feelings of hostility and hatred entertained by the latter to. wards their conquerors would speedtily disappear
We cannot conclude this address witbout decting your attention to the duties ou owe too Ur vast Asiatli em ire, A seventh Dart of the hiuman race are there subject to Brithi%i rule, and It behoves you to institute a rigid inquiryintotbemannerinhwbchtbey are governed.

We hope you wil eazmestly raise your vaoces in o.ppoeltion to this dlis* bonourable aud covestous policy; for, unless that policy be revised the day Wil sorely come when tho foundations of our Indiam, empire wil be undermtned, and that masnideetnt superstructure will fal to the roud frmin anthet Ibeexmpl ofthe certain Operation

Report On The Russian Medical Department.
RPEORZ OZA rZ AMMASN MEDICAZ DEPABr.
XMW. NI
A oopy of a Report on the-orgAnization of the Prussian Meical Department and the sanikry state of their Crimean hospitals wa aid Wefore the late ]ouse of Commons On the motion of Mr. Stafford. The report, which is sufficiently intereBting, is drawn up by Dr. Moatt and Mr. Wyatt. They divide their subject-matter into four heads-I, the organization of the medical deputment generally; 2, the surgery of the war; 3, medical history and the sLitary condition of the hospitals and camps; and 4, the prevailing diBes In the Rusian army, as well as those of the native popuLtion or Tarts. These are agan subdivided.
The medical departmeut includes two elasses of students1, thoae educated at the expense of the State, and 2, those tducatedat their ownexpenseatthevaous Universitie,. The
i4ht of the first elss to serve in the army is compolsory {for a period); every medical offioer may retire on balf-pay after 25 yeas service, and on full pay after 30 yeas service. To each regiment, which consists of four battalions of 1,000 men each, is attached a medical sat
of one surgeon-major and three " surgeons of battalions," which latter term applies to every junior medical officer who first joins a regiment ; but, if attached toahospital instead of a regfinent, hiS primary appellationwould be Ordinatcur de I HEpifto His pay will be 250 silver ronbles, or S0. a-year, with serrice and forage. The noet step is that of sargeon of a regiment, or Ordinmteur Super. ric-, the pay of wbich is 346 roubles, or 1,360f. a-year. The third gr.ae is that of a doctor of a division, or 6f a regiment of Guards, or chief offioer of a small hospital, or aide to a chief officer of a larger hospital. In this cauethe rank is that of lieutenant-colonel or colonel with 505 roubles salr, and 176 table-noney. Then come the supdrior grades of doctor of a corps (o55 roubles salry); doctor-in. chief of a corps of the Guard; and, lastly, director of the medical department of the army, or pneral staff-doctor of an army, or member of council of the military medical department of the empire. The last rank is that of masjorgeneral or general, and the pay 725 ronbles and 300 tablemoney. One advaita9e of the Russa sytem is this-that if the state of the service precludes the promotion of a medical officer fromn wat of vacandes, his prospects as to pay and retirement still progressively advance by the provision for increase of pay after ev6ry five years' successive servioe, and also increase of relative army rank for anyspcial merit digplayed; and as there is no indacement for prolonged service, old and effete officers give place to young and efficient successors In every regiment is a dispenser, who holds the rank of a non-cqmmissioned officer, and in every general hospital is an apothecary. Then there are the dressers, or " felchers," who are young lads taught what the Fench term la paile chirurger,e, their duties being anaogous to those of the medical subordinates attached to European regiments in Iadia. The cooking for the hospitals appeared excellent, and wel conducted by regularly attached cooks. There were found five different scales of diet. The bread supplied was white and of fine quality, but the sick, from habit, often preferred the black. The soup containedUllb. of meat per man, and plenty of cabbage and other vegetables; it was thickened with meal, and found P very eCcellent and palatable pottage. Tea ws largely con. sumed by all clses. Fach sick soldier costs the Govprnment some 25 kopecks, or ls., per diem. An officer belonging to the Russian " Intendance" resides in all large towns where troops are stationed, and purchases all thingsrequisite forhospital and regimental requirements, spplying them to the colonel on requisition; animals and vehicles for the use of the sick and wounded are liberally given by thenation, and theambulance arrangementsappear to be very efficient. The female nurses are highly spoken of; they are aU ladies, called " Sisters of Mercy," and generally widows of ofFicers. From what the authors of the report saw of these valuable women, they are led to the con. clusion, irresistibly, that female nursing, as a general rule, can only be succeaully practised from either the predominance of strong feelings of devotionoraffection. ThefuU diet for hospitalconvaloscentswas 21bofblackbread,llbofmeat
lb. of barley for gruel, 1D litre (quart) of khrass, 3oz of brandy, and salt; the low diet (B 2) included Illb. of white bread, lb. of meat, ilb. of barley, a A litre of wahite wvine, and salt. The daily rations for " duty" men of the Russan army include llb. of black bread, llb. of meat, I t litre of kwass (a fermented beverage), a 2 litre of sour cabbage, a 1, litre of bhrley, 22 grains of salt, ai of a grain of horse radish, a 4 of a litre of vinegar, and a } of a grain of pepper. The brave defenders of Sebastopol appear to have enjoyed the advantages of the very best modern surgery. Among 80,000 wounded, 10,030 capital operations were performed (including 3,000 amputations). Jnion or healing by the first intention is never attempted by the Russian sargeons, on account oE the impossibility of obtaining so desirable a resulb in crowded hospitals; when it is attempted pywemia, abscess, and phlegmonous inflannation are thealmostinvariable results. One-fourth of the fatal cases after operation resulted from PYasmia; erysfpelas and phlegmonous inflammation were common, but there was no greatamount of hospital gangrene, and very little tetanus; both these alrections were generally fatal. The circular operation seems to have been preferred to the flap, in all Amputation cases, and some good stumps were seen. Wounds of the head and chest are stated to have been singularly fataL In cases of wounds in the cavity of the chest, bleeding is not resorted to, but digitalis administered instead. No real typhus, was detected in-any of the hospitals, notwithstanding their crowded condition. It may be sk-ed to what cause is to be attributed the very large amount of sickness and mortality among the Russians1
TSe autbors of the report think it partly due to intermit. tent and bilious remittent fevers, with a marked tenden
to alqrnamia, and a low t¶yphoid state, and diarrhcea, which occasionallydegenerated into dysentery. Remittent fevers are the endemic of the Crimea, and this is the disease from 'which the Tartars chiefly suffer. This was agravated by the Russian system of subterranean hutting. T?e Russian soldiers appeared unhealthy, either prematurely old and withered, or very young; their aspect was saUow and their persons and camps generaly the reverse of clean. Thoy have a predilection for strong waters, which fonr part of their rations. In phYsical conformation and height they were above the average, equal in height to the English, but inferior to them in capacity of chest and muscular conformation. The horses, even of the officers, were in wretchedL condition, and had no kind of clothing. Such i4 a summary of the most interesting details of the Report,
Witchcraft.
WIFCHCRAP.F
TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In your article yesterday on the -witchcraft trial at Stafford yox referred to the progress of science and'the boast of the enlightenment of the 19th century-to steam navigation and the electric telegraph-as inconsistent with. the credulity and superstition Involved in the witcheraft case, which strikingly indicated aso the want of education in the country; but allow me to observe that a curious and important question here arises in connexion with national education. The clergy generally insist that thero shall be no national education unless fonuded on the Bible. Now, it is notorious that the Bible recognizes the existence of witchcraft, of " wizards" possessed 'with " familiar spirits" (Lev., xx. 6-27); see also the " trial of jealousy" (Numb., v. 12-31) similar to our Saxon ordeals now do nounced as superstitious; and what power wizards were not only supposed to possess, but actuaUy did exhibit, is strikingly shown in the lVitch of Endor raising the spirit of Samuel before King SauL (1 Sam., xxviii. 11.)
Now, I desire to ask the clergy how they can disabuse the minds of their country parishioners of the credulity and superstition involved in the belief in witchcraft, when such men as Farmer Charlesworthy may appeal to the Bible as recognising their belief in this supernatural influence? This is a lain question which must be met by a plain answer. It will not do in this inquiring age to reply by shooting out " Infdelity and Atheism?'

ROMAN COINS.-The excavations necessary for
RO'MAN COINS.-The excavations necessary for the new road now in course of construction on the estate of Major Sibthorp at Canwick have revealed many relics of the past. The last discovery of interest would seem to denote that during the Anglo-Roman period the Canwickhill was a station-and possibly an important one-of the then powerful and warlike rulers of Britain. This appears the more probable because the site is a commanding one, and especiaUy applicable for military operations; and it is a well-known and oft-recorded fact that the Romans generally raised their works and fixed 'heir camps upon the brow of some hill overlooking large tracts of country. Of this abundant eridence presents itself in this city and neighbourhood, and scarcely in tny part of Britain are there more remnants of the enterprise, uimiht, and magnificence of the Romans to be found than in ncoln. The other day a number of small brass coins, evidently from a Roman mint, were dug out at Canwick at; a depth of 1S inches from the surface. The majority are inr a high state of preservation, especially some of The time of Constantine, commonly known as the first Christiian Emperor,4 whose son Constantinus died A.D. 340 - consequently they must havo bean struck previous to that date. The nnl abandornment of the island by the Romans occurred about A.D. 414, and doubtless the Roman coinage continued to circulate until that time, and, it may be, until superseded by the Saxon currency.

Wednesday Evening.
The business in the English funds to~day has been unimportant, and prices have remained without variation, although towards the close there was a slight tendency to increased firmness. Consols were quoted 934 to J for money and 93n to J for the 8th of ApriL Bank Stock left of?f at 220 to 222 with dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequer-bonds, 98- to i ; India Bonds, 4s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bils (March), par to 3s. premium.
The general demnand for money to-day was not excessive.
Foreign stocks were heavy, and in some cases a slight decline took place. The bargains in Mexican were at 23, 23k, 23, ,and 23i. Turkish Six per Cents. were purchased at57k. The general transactions comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 102i and. 103; New Granada Active, 22i; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 771,

The corn-market this morning was without recovery from the decline of yesterday.
The final quotations of the French Three per 'Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 50c. for money and 70f. 65c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth.
About &OOl. in bar gold was taken from the Rank to-day for exportation to the continent. lOO,0001., sovereigns, are said tohave been taken by the Government this week for transmission to the Cape.
* The suspension has been announced of Messrs. B. James Browin and Co., extensive timber merchants and sbipbuilders and owners at Sunderland. Their direct debts amount to 80,0001. upon acceptances and 30,0001. on open uccount, while their indirect commitments on bils discounted ara 1o0,0001. Their assets, it is hoped, may realisz
about 1.4s. 9d. in the pound. The house had been established about 12 years, and apprehensions are entertained that its stoppage may bring down several smaller firms.
A meeting was held this morning of the shareholders of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation, wlhich was announced on the 18th inst. as bemg about to go into liquidation. The directors of the bank; have hitherto desired to avoid publicity, and enough has transpired of the facts elicited by the proprietary to-day to explain their feeling in that respect. Wbile the paid-up capital was 250,0001., it appears that 237,0001. has been lent upon mortgage on estates belonging to Colonel Waugh, one of the directors, at Beddington, in Surrey, and Branktea-castle, Dorsetshire; while other advances, to a very serious extent, have been made to dirctors and to the manager. At the meeting to-day Mr. John Carnac Morris the chairman of the company, presided, and that gentleman admitted he was indebted 12,00Ol. to the establishment, against which they hold securities on houses, &c. Mr. Fendall, a director, was understood to have borrowed 5,3601. on the security of his own shares; Colonel Curtis, a director, 5,6001 onsteam sharesworth 3,0001.; andMr. Stephens, the manager, 27,0001., on various 6ecurities. Diuring the proceedings MIr. GuedaUla, a shareholder, inquired upon what pretext or temptation 237,0001. could have been sunk in mortgages when the legitimate business for which the concern was established offered safe, regular, and heavy profits. The reply that 10 per cent. was paid upon the mortgages caused a strong feeling of indignation, since the very fact of such a rate being offered should have been a warning of their questionable character. Captain Corfield, another shareholder, pointed out the deceptive character of the clause in the Charter providing for a meeting upon a fourth of the capital being lost, and maintained that those by whom it had been disregarded deserved heavy punishment. The direct liabilities of the bank were stated by Mr. Coleman, the accountant, to be 397,7341.; and it was intimated that, after allowing for large losses, the assets may yield 413,4501., which wiU leave about 16,0001. to meet the shareholders' paid up capital of 250,0001. Four Indian banks-the Oriental, the North-Western, the Mercantile of Bomnbay, and the Agra-were stated to be willing to advance the amount necessary to meet immediate liabilities in India-about 104,0001.-and also to give time upon such bills of the London and Eastern Bank as are at present in their possession, on condition that certain assets Fhall be han(led over to them, and that the shareholders shall give their notes of hand for the 50 per cent. of capital stiU remaining uncaled. This airangement seemed to be regarded as a fair and desirable one, and a committee, consisting of Sir William Gomm, Colonel Yates, and Mr. Beville, was ultimately formed to promote it.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day there was a renewed examination of BMr. E. Esdaile, the Governor of the Royal British Bank. The 17th of April has been appointed for the declaration of a further dividend, which it is expected wiU be 2s., or perhaps 2s. 6d., in the pound.
The small amount of dollars brought by the last West India steamer has been sold at 61d., being an advance of id. on the price realized for those by thepreceding packet.
The annexed mercantile letter from the River Plate shows that, notwithstanding the inefficiency of the Government, Montevideo is making steady progress, and that European settlers in the country are likely to prosper. A submarine telegraph is contoem plated to Buenos Ayres. From the latter republic there is nothing new. The import trade seems to have been overdone, and two heavy failures have taken place:
"Montevideo, Feb. 4.
"Pablic expectation is directed to the opening of the Chambers during the present month, and it is generally beiEved the debatesa vill be very strong, but on what subject no one appears to be agreed. General complaints are mada of smugglIng from the Brazilian frontier, and yet no mea*ures are adopted to put a stop to it. The merchants who administer the Customs have pointed out the evil and suggested the remedy, but the Government takes no notice of it. In fact, general apathy prevails in all matters with the Government that are not purely of a party or personal mature. A decree has been published opening four new ports for goods where there is but a scanty population, the * flects of which will soon be apparent by the decrease of revenue. The measure would be a good one if properly carried out, but what can be expected when Customs' officers bolding responsible situations are allowed salariesnotsuperior to those of ordinary clerks in commercial houses? Since the merchants have administered the Customs from April last the monthly zevenue has exceeded the previous nine months by more than the amount agreed to be paid on the British claims, notwithstanding the tariff of duties has been considerably lowered, and if they were assisted by the Government thero can be no doubt a much larger increase would take place. While nothingis done for the roads,which in rainy weather are in an almost impassable condition, the Government is seriously thinldng of establishing an electric telegraph between the town and two villages outside andBuenos Ayres! InNovemberlastHerlMajesty'srepresontative,Mr. Tlsornton, officiallyinformed theGovernment that buoys had been placed by one of Her Majests vessels on the English Bank, where so many vessels have been lost, yet the public were informed of this only about a month ago, and very likely the benevolence of Her Majestq's Government was considered an impertinence. In spite of this apathy and bad government, the prosperity of the country is advancing, and if peace continues for a few wears it will be as wealthy and the peonle as enterprising as before the invasion by Roeas, who did his utmost to ruin it. Exchange has fluctuated between 45d. and 43d., and left off at the latter, contrary to expectation. It was believed it would exceed 95d.
"Buenos Ayres is in a state of excitementaboutthe coming clection of Governor, and the result will probably determine the pending question whether she rejoins the Confederation or becomes a, perfectlY separate and independent State. She is now independent, but in the constitution there is proviion made for her becoming a part of the Argentine Confederation, and there is a party who wish to expunge that provision altogether. The railway between the city and San Josc de Flores will be opened on the 14th inst. A trial trip was made the other day which gave perfect ratisfaction. There have been two more heavy failures in Buenos Ayres,-one, Mr. Winter, a German broker, whose liabilities are vaIously estimated at from 116,0001. to 300,0001., and the otherEenorGaray abarraquero, who is said to have previouly ilegly assigned his property to another party. These failures ave created a general want of confidence. Paper dollars were falling, being at 340 the doubloon, and sales offered for August at 376. Exchange, 72s. to 69s. In fact, neither the political nor commercal horizon of Buenos Ayres is very clear
" There is no news of importance from the Argentine Confederation. The differential duties tariff wll come into operation this month. It is said a strong opposition will be made to it at the next assembling of Congress.
"Pasgayhas refused to ratify the treaty made with tho United States, ostensibly because there have been some verbal alterations made in it, but, it is believed, in reality because President Lopez wis4es first to see the isse of the late Consul Hopkins's demands for t*mages. Adsieral Johnstone has gone up to Assumpton inc Her Majesty's steamer Rifleman, but the object of hii,yoyage is not pub.

The adjourned balf-yearly meeting of this comDany was beld at the Euston station yesterday, Sir S. Mortfn Peto in the chair.
Mr. MAtsEL, the secretary, read the minutes of the last two meetings, which were confirmed. He then read the reort, which stated that the trafflo during the past half year had continuea steadily to increase, the receipts from the railway exhibiting an excess of 8,7971. over those of the corresponding period of the previous year, and the earnings of the steamboats showing an increase of 3,6951. Under the provisions of the agreement with the London and Northwestern company the general working expenses are comnmuted for a payment during the first year of 46 per cent. of the receipts, but this amount, it wilt be seen, has during the past half-year been considerably exceeded, chiefly by charges incidental to the change of system, and which will not again occur; there will, however, always be some expenses not included under the working agreement. With the view of mneeting the pressimg necessity for increased means of conveyance of the traffic between Esngland and Ireland, the directors have during the past half-year purchased two additional steam. vessels, towards which the fund set aside for insurance has been appropriated. By this arrangement the great advantage of additional vessels is secured at once to the company, while the object and intention of the fund is fully maintained. During the past half-year an additional fund has been formed, which is intended to meet the gradual depreciation which must be looked for in the value of the vessels generally.
The engineer reports that the permanent way, w orks, and stations of the main line and branches are in good condition. The sea, during the past half-year, has disturbed a portion of tho beach at Penmaen Mawr, so thae it has been necessary to make some additions tothepitchingof the foreshore, which will be completed in the course of a few weeks.
The accounts show a net balance to the credit of revenue of 31,7831. after payment of debenture interest and other first charges; from this sum the directors recommend the payment of the full half-year's dividend, at the rate of 5.1 per cent. per annum, on the first preference stock ; and one years dividend, at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, on account of the arrears on the issued portion of the second preference stock; leaving a balance of 1,6771. to be carried forward to the current half-year.
The capital account showed that 4,304,9301. had been received, and 4,339,1881. expended, leaving a balance of 24,2571. against the company. The revenue account for the half-year ending the 31st of Decoember last showed that 139,1301. bad been received on the railway, and 27,667% from the steamboats, making together 166,7971. ; and that the expenses in respect of the railway amounted to 70,7231., and on account of the steamboats to 25,2511., together 96,979t.; leaving a balance of 68,4071. in favour of the railwvay, and of 2,4171. in favour of the steamboats (after setting aside 5,4011. for insurance and depreciation funds);making a net profit of 70,8'241. To this was added 17 5021.
the balance from the p receding half-year, and 340L. allowed by the London and north-Western Company as their proportion of ioss shown on the steamboats, after charging interest on the value of the vessels, making 88,6661. Out of thiswas deducted 17,3261 dividend on first preference shares at 8s. 3d. per share, declared at last meeting, 3,5681. expenditure appertaining to previous half-years, 2461. balance of traffic, 3,000A. rent of Bangor and, Carnarvon Railway, and 5,5271. inerest onadvances; leaving 58,999
less amount of debenture interest, and of B. and C. bonds 27,2161., leaving 31,7831.
The CIiUR3Ai, in moving the adoption of the report, said they had been extremely anxious that the accounts presented on that occasion, being the first under the new system of working, should have all the arrears carefully settled, and all open accounts closed, so that hereafter they would simply have to look to the accounts from time to time under their arrangement with the North-Western Company. He thought, on referring back to the receipts, omitting those for 1853, it being the year of the Dublin Exhibition, that the inerease was such as they might reasonably have expected. The passenger traffic for the halfyear ending 31st of December, 1852, amounted to 53,583.; ending 31st of December, 1854, to 62,1791. ; 31st of December, 1855, to 64,2421.; and 31st of December, 1856, to 68,5391. For parcels the figures were 2,6731, 3,5191., 3,7431., and 4,0031. ; and for goods and live stock, 24,6491., 39,1411., 45,1201., and 49,54'. respectively. The steamboat trafc, as compared with previous years, also showed an increase. The general results showed the company was placedin a position of much greaterisecarity by having the steamboat traffie in their own bands than they would have been if entirely dependent upon others, During the past half-year the North-Western had found it impossible to continue the traffic with the small number of steamboats at their disposal, and the question of additional steamers was oneothat had pressed itsel upon the directors; and after considering the matter vith great anxiety they had determined to use the amount to the credit of the insurance fund for the purchase of the necessary steamers - and they had succeeded in purchasing two vessels, after taving had them examined most carefully, and given the best attention to see where the best vessels could be obtained, at a cost of 30,0001. These vesels had been in the service of the Government; and, although both of thep, were new vessels, they obtained them at a much less pncO than it was possible to contemplate. (Hear, hear.) The original cost of one of these vessls far exceeded what they had paid for them botb. (Hear, hear.) The mode adopted for payment of them was to apply the amount of the insurance fund to that purpose, and they had stipulated for the payment of the remainder at certain periods, so that they mnght calculate upon bein
able to meet those instalments from future accumulation of the fund without encroaching on the dividend. (gear, hear.) They bad also thought it right that the amount remainung to he liquidated should be insured, so that they sbould not have any risk in that respect. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the expenditure of the last half-year, there were some items which appeared to call for explanation. In the closing of their affairs there were, of ,course, eertain expenses with regard to clerks ander notice, and other things, whichtleywere eompelledtomeset. after negotiating with theNorth- Western,snd going intothe wholematter,they allowed them, on account em the siX months, 851., leaving 1,233ot tobe borne by this eotiny. That was; fairarrangea ment between themselves ana thNorth-Westrn. With respect to the secretary and general staff, it was not to be SUDpposed that the whole of these expenses had arisen simply from the secretarial department. In fact, only a portion of it amountntg to 7921. of the entire 1 4941 , might be considered as chargeable to the secretary's department, against which and the costs of direction they had an allowance from the North-Western Company. The rest might be taken as closng up beveral matters in connexion with that department, so as to make the whole of the affairs complete for the present half-year, They had also to pay various ineidental matters, such as the valuation of the stores, of the permannt ay, the surplus materials, tho rolling stock, and all those various things which were nocessary to be taken into consideration upon a transfer The charges for stamps and commission on debentures had been large, in consequence of a very large nortiou of the debenture debt having become due in July last, and the necessarv expense of the substitution of a new form of deed had fallen on the half-year, which would not again occur. They thought it prudent to take up temporary advances from their bankers pending the negotiations of new loans, in sabstitution of the very large amount paid off, *ad, although thi was done at a very hiclrcharge tempora. - , it resulted in an arrangement beneficial to the company. He then explained other items connected with the traffic account, which they had to close by the end of the half-year. He trusted that both classes of preference proprietors would see that there was a prospoot of their dividend being regularly paid, and that the old proprietors themselves would begin to feel that the best had been done for their property, and that they were placed in a position which, though not satisfactory to themselves, was, at any rate, better than they might have anticipated. (Cheerm) He then moved the adoption of the report and accounts,
Mr. BEmSosr seconded the motion.
AShareholder objected to the item of interest onadvances, 5,5271., and gave in his written notice of holding the directors responsible for those payments. As a preference shareholder, he considered he could do no more at the meeting than give a written notice, because he would be outvoted.
The CHAimtuNy explained that the advances referred to amounted to 224,0001. advanced on the security of unitsued preference shares. Unless the London and North-Western had advanced that sum to meet the liabilities of the company, the whole of the net revenue must have been appropriated to the payment of the company's debts, instead ofto paying interest on the preference shares. Upon what ground the hon. proprietor, as a holder of preference shares, opposed the payment of interest on those advances he (the chairman) could not understand. He could, however, assure him that the London and North-Western Company were their best friends,
The Shareholder said he objected to the preponderating interest of the London and North-Western Company in the undertaking, and he wished to know when they were to have the clear balance-sheet adverted to by the chairman ?
The CHAIRMAN remarked that, had it not been for the London and North-Western theywouldnot haverceived one shilling dividend that day; and until they could issue 'he remainder of their preference stock the advances must remain as they were. It did not matter whether they paid 5 por cent, on the advances or 5 per cent. on the second preference shares-it made no difference whatever to the company.
Kdisaussion then ensued respecting the present position of th company as compared with that shadowed forth in the report of the Commnittee of Consultation and Inquiry in 1855, in the course of which it was stated that, independent of thle 46 Per cent, for working expenses the first year, 44 per cent, the second year, and 1 per cent, above that of the ondon and North-Wern thereafter there were other matters of expense to be adjusted between the two companies, which were admitted by the committee to be fair and reasonable.
The CHAIRmAN explained that some of the excises in the past half-year had arisen in consequence of the settlement of accounts, necessary to enable them to change the system of working, and- to transfer the stores and other matters to the London and North-Western for working the line. The directors could not be held accountable for the opinons of the committee expressed in their report, although they had done what they could for the benefit of the company.
Mr. BELoE, the secretary of the coizmittee, said their report was issued in September, 1855, but the working agreement with the London and North-Western was not signed until the following March; certain differences had to be settled independent of the rate of percentage for working the ^hester and Hiolyhead traffic.
An original shareholder estimated, from the increased trafic and the nature of the agreement with-tbe London and lTorth-Western Comoany, that ll1,000L would have ee bl for irisena; bn of coe hedid Aot take

They insured their own boats, and had appliee that money to the purchase of the two new boats, which would be paid for entirely out of revenue. The capital account was virtually closed, and when they realized their assets the present amount of expenditure would be somewhat reduced.
The report ws3 adopted, a dividend for the half-ear endiDg 31st of December last on the first preference aares was declared at the rate of 53 per cent. ,per annum, payable t4e Pd of April; lso a 5 per cent. dividend on the second preference shares for 12 months, on account of arrears of interest due prior to October, 1S56.
The forfeiture of 20 original shares, of 31 first preference shares, and 72 second preference shares, was confinred.
The retiring directors, the Hon. W. 0. Stanley and Mr. W. Reynolds, and the retring auditor, Mi,. J. Lambert, were re-elected.
A formal resolution was passed approving the purchase by the directors of the Telegraph and Sea Nymph steamers for 30,0901 It waastated that the Telegraph wga larger than any.osher boat on the station, and was intenddd for themid-da service. The Sea Nyinph would convey

TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-You having inserted many letters concerning the above subject, we are in duty bound to intrude again upon your columns, and in reply urge that our balloons are as
armless as the generalitv of children's toys. We do not pretend to attempt to convinco the publio that if they are put into the fire, so that the gas ignites, theg wil not explode, for they were not made for such purpose, and never guaranteed fire-proof on sale; a knife, or any child's toy if you are intent upon it, can be made to do much mischief: which with care would be amusing and useful; xand our bhlloons mith far less xttention would be a harmlest e creation for juvenites. Since the publicity given in your paper numbers have docked to our factory to Fee the manner In which they are made, and the orders wo are daily receiving are a sufficient proof howr they are appreciated by the public- our sales being mere than 12,000 per diem.
We are. Sir, Tour obedient R+vXi

FREAOHING.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Your correspondent fromn "the Broad Phylacteory
complains that I have most umwsrran- ay given a local habitation, if not a name, to the archbf'op, whom he now describes with inimitable precision as "an abstract personification !" He thinks himself, however, quite varranted in concluding that " Cantab" mnst be identical with an unfortunate professor whose charActer he proceeds to draw with that delicacy of touch which marks hia sketches. Hia'-irth is equally excited by small things as by great-by a meret slip of the pen as by the failing faculties of our poor nature. The verbal errors in the pssages which I cited Kre certainly not in my rough note, but I have no doubt they must havea been in the copy, which I sent htly and without revisioa to the post. The momen$ two of them-as printed in 3ouc columns-caught my eye, I sent you the neoemary altera. tions, although the mistakes were so obvious that a chitd would detect, and a good-natured child would eorrec. them. If your correspondent really knew me, as he pro. fesses to do, even his charity would be large enough to CDn. cede that I am tolerably familiar with Frencb, and not altogether ignorant of Latin.
I ought, perhaps, to state that in the expression " excessi
aromris Dei," I alluded to the remark of Pope Innocent XI. in speaking of the errors of Fenelon, a prelate who borer
some resemblance to our Primate in his muldness and moderation, and in the treatment which he received from those whom the influence of asch virtues could not move. I am quite wiUling to admit that the remark of Pascal is not universally true. Wit is not always the vehicle of nialignity. There is a gentle pleasantry which glddens, no less than a cruel raillery which embitters life. The greatest wit in modern times, Sidney Smith, was a kind-hearted man, who lost neither his jest nor his friend. Still, I cannot persuade myself that any remark in Pascal is valueless, and I am confirmed in this instance by the testimony of one whowas a recluse, but an acute observing man-IA Brayare. He says, evidently quoting the very fragment which I am charged withIneedlessly disinterring " Diseur be bons irots4 mauvais caractare; je le dirais, s'il n'avait ete dit."
I have not said a syllable in disparagement of lr. Spur. geon. I know that a dark food of immorality and vice is pouring through every part of the vast metropolis, and, while thousands and tens of thousands are daily swept away, I have no wsh to criticize all the movements of thestrong hand which is Isbouring to snatch them from death. But it is one thing to respect tho motives, to admire theabilities, to deal gently with the prejudices of those from. whom we differ; it is quite another thing to purchase peae at the expense of truth, to sacrifice the principles and effac3 the distinctive notes and character of the Church to which we belong. Sir, Ido not dwell in "the Broad Phylactery-I I am content to live under an old-fashioned sign which bears these simple words, " In things essential, unity; in things doubtful, liberty; in al things, charity."
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

The Coolies In The West Indies.
THE COOLIES IX T2HE WEST INDI_&
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES.
Sir,-In reply to Mr. Gladstone's inquiry, which I have, just read in 1h7ie Timaof this morning, I can state, for the. removal of any doubts in his mind, or which may be prow duced by his letter in the minds of your reade*, that ther terms on which the Coolie works in the British West. Indies are so favourable as to be without example in the history of the world.
He has a free passage to the colony and back to India in ships which are engaged and regulated with the greatest strictness by the Land and Emigration Commissioners; with, food, clothing, and medical comforts on the voyage,; with v house rent free in the colony; with mnedical attendance and food during sickness, and he earns as much in one day as he could in a fortnight in India. i-usage is always sufficient ground for terminating a contract, and the Governorcan deprive an employer convicted of repeated acts of illtreatment of all his indentured labourers.
Very few Chinese have emigrated to the British colonies, our Government havlng feared that the attempt to procue women might endanger the friendly relations of the twocountries, the Chinese laws being so strict with regard to he emigration of women. A permanent emigration of mea only would not be satisfactory to the oolonies.
In 1852 about 800 Chinese men went to Demesr, and, subsequently three shipe were despatched to Trinidad by the agent of the Land and Emigration Cominissioners, with 1,013 men, of whom 988 arrived safelv. Those in Demerra were so industrious that on first landing they thought it a hardship zLot to be allowed to work on SundaysTrusting, for the sake of the people themselves, whose condition would be materilly improved thereby, that the present war may lead to an unrestricted emigration of men and women from China to our West India colonies,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

in time to cateh the Jnra from Southampton. As it seemsfrom the advertisements of the company tbat there is but one steamer (the Cambria) employed the scvce between Marseilles and Malta, and as she ought to be waiting at the latter plawe for the homeward mails due there on the 12th it would seem she could not be at Mrseiles to take on the outward masila due thenoe on the 18th.
If the agents of the company have not provided anothersteamer to take on the baga, rid France, our correspondence will necessarily be detained at MAseiUes from the 18th inst. to the 15th proximo, not a -very satisfactory result to tosewho aidthe xtr posagerates to secure the, advantage of fouPr dayts' lateer itelignc:t aes. oscr b

This charity confines its benevolent aid to no locality, denomination, profession, or calling, but admits the cbildren of prents who wexe oce in prosperity without other claims than orphana nd present distress. Since the opening of the in ion 441 chQdren have been admitted, 369 of whom hsve completedtheir term, and 72 now remain in the school-viz., 36 boys and 36 girls.

We ta1ke the following exposition of the present I.w and Fkat1ce at Elections from a new edition of ,&r. Warren'X work on the subjrot .-
During the last four years several changes, some fI
Womt importane, in the election law of the united king. I
ra, have been effected by the Leisllature. One relates to I Ireland, and provides for a complete annual revision and I registration of the Parliamentary voter8 for the city of Dub'in, by barrister-s of the Iish br, styled by the &statte 'reXi.iagbanisters, not exceeding three in number, of six y'earn' standing at the least; and attending at theam
lace, at the samie time, but holding separate courts, which aAre ecunrts of record.
* Three Acts relate to Scotland. The first restricts the polling to one day, in counties, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., subjeet to being closed earlier, on request of all the candidates, or in case of riot; and regulates the arran-ements of polling-places and the times for polling. A second requires the day for election, in counties and combined outnties, to be not less than six nor more than 12 days after the receipt of the writ; but in the case *f Orkney and Shetl,nd the law remains as fixed by statute 2d and 3d of William IV., chap. 65. A third establishes a new code of procedure for the burgh registration of Scotland.
^ Three other statutbs relate to England and Wales. The first limits the polling in counties to one day, from the hour of 8 a.m. to that - p.m. The poll clerks at the final olwe of the poll are to enclose and seal their several books and publicly deliver them, so enclosed and sealed, to the *shezifl; under-sheriff or sheriSf's deputy, presiding at the poll, and every such deputy must publicly deliver or transmit them to the sherif or under-sheriff, who must keep them unopened till the reassembling of the Court on the day next ut one after the close of the pol,-but if that day hbe Snday, then the following Monday,-when he shaU openly break the seals, and cast up the number of votes as they appear on the books, and not later than 2 p.m. openly declare the state of the poll and proclaim the members or member chosen. The second contains several importaut
>oi-ions, applicable to both counties and boroughs. writs addressed to the sheriffs of counties require them to snake election-for counties 'only, and not' (as heretofore)
further or otl'ise. Writs for the cniversities of Oxford and Cam),ridgetre to be addressed to their respective ViceChi ncellors, writs for boroughs to their respective returning. officers; and such Vice-Chancellors and returningofficersare to certify the election according to the direction of the writ, tS prescribed by the Act.
- The special county court for holding a county election must be held on any day not later from that of making proclamation than the 12th, nor sooner than the sixth day. Elections in boroughs must be had within six days after the receipt of the writ, at least three clear days' notice-which are to be exclusive of those of proclamxtion and of election -being given of the day of election. The polling at the two universities is not to continue for more than five days at the most; and the Vice-Chancellors may appoint additional polling-places, pro Vice-Chancellors, poling clerks, and other officers, as may be judged necessary. No poll at any election is to be taken at inns, taverns, hotels, public, houses, &c., or other place directly communicating there. v ith, unless with the written consent of all the candidates. And on petition of the justicesin quartersessionsassembled, 1ler Majedsy may substitute other for existing pollingplas..
"The third statute constitutes the sherHff the returning -ficer in boroughs vhen that office is vacant.
IAll these Acts, however, practically valuable as are their provisions, fade into insignificance when compared with anotber passed on the 10th of Angust, 1854, entitled, IThe tur7ipt Practices Prevention Act, 1854,' which is con.- miended to the gravest and most deliberate consideration of evesy candidate, together with his agents and advisers, before entering into a contested election. The provisions of this Act, often spoken of with a levity showing ignorance of its true character, will be found so subtle, comprehensive, and stringent as to fill with anxiety the most conscientious, and alarm even the astutest, and those disposed to be most uscrupulons.
The 'corrupt practices in the election of members to serve in Parliament,' at which this formnidable Act aims, it 4leclares to be threefold-bribery, treating, undue influenoes After carefully defining each, in terms embracing almost -e ery conceivable device to which corruption can resort, and annexing to infractions of its provisions imprisonment, fines, and penalties, the 36th sectioi deals thus with the csse of candidates:-
"IIf any candidate at an election for any county, city, -or borough, shall be declared by any election committee guilty, by himself or his agents, of bribery, treating, or undue influence at such election, such candidate shaI be incapable of being elected or of sitting in Parliamert for such coiunty, city, or borough during the Parliament then in existpene.'
"It will be noted that this mortifying and deroga-tory incapacity attaches to the simple 'declaration ..of an election committee,' which cannot be revised.
It is conclusive and irreversible. This circumstance is sugeestive of caution, equally to candicates and committees; to the former as to their sayings and -doings, and the appointment of individuals for whose sayings and doings they are thus declared responsible; the 3atter as concerns the due discharge of their twofold functons of judges and jurymen. A rash, superficial, or perfunctoly discharge of those duties inflicts a wrong grievous and irreparable.
The offences of bribery, tzeating, and undue influence are respectively defined in the second, tbird, fourth, and zixth sections of the Act, and are the result of a careful consideration of the expressions used in al former Acts repealed by the one in question, and of the cases, during a long series of years, dealt with by election committees, a, Tao be seen at large iri the second volume of the work. (eitain expressions in these sections-' for this purpose,' 4 in order to induce, vAwith the intent that,' 'knowiingly,
'corruptly,' and Idirectly or indirectly,' convey their own ,meaning, and indicate the province of an election corn. mnittee, called upoa to deal judicially with the sayings and doings, the motives and objects of a candidate or his agents. It should be observed that there is, at the close of the second section, which defines bribery, the foUowingproviro :-' That the aforesaid enactmept sball not extend, or be construed to extend, to any money paid or agreed to be paid for or on account of any legal exsenses bonQ de in-curred at, or concerning, any election.e
"An important case on this section was lately under the consideration of a Court of Error, whose decision is, it is believed, likely to be submitted to the House of Lords, with reference to the payment to a voter, of his travelling
penses. TheoCourt decided that it is an offence aainst the first branch of the first clause of the second section of the Act to promise tohpay a voter his travelling expenses conditionally on bis coming and voting for a partionlar candidate, but that it is legal to promise to pay a -voter bis travelling expenses without such a condition. And, further, that merely paying a voter his travelling expenses on account of his having voted is not prohibited by the second branch of the first clause of the second section, since it isenot necessarily a corrupt payment, but that it would be illegal and corrupt if the payment were made in consc-quence of any previoua unlawful promise to make it conditional on the voter's voting, or if it were connected with any corrupt bargain for the future.
"The question arose out of the Cambridge election In 1854. The legality of paying travelling expenses to bring -up outvoters was discussed in the committee-room, in the pTesence of Mr. Slade, Q.C., one of the candidates; on -whicb, a law book having been sent for, and the opinion of the late Chief Justice Tindal read from it, Mir. Slade gaid IIthink that the expenses are legal, and that nothing Ubeynnd legal expenses are to be paid.' On this the following printed circular was filed up with the words in italics :--
'Mr. L. Carter.
Cambridae Borough Election Committee-room,
Lion Hotel, Aug. 12, 18S4.
Sir,-Thie Mayor having appointed Wednesday next -for the nomination, and Thursday for the pollina, you are earnestly requested to return to Cambridge and record your -vote in favour of Lord Maidstone and F. W. Slade, Esq., -Q.C. "'Yours truly,
"'CHARLES BALr, Chairman. Your travellivg expensws ewi bepaid.i"'
This letter was sent to the voter, who was at Hunting. -don, beforoethe election; and he came to Cambridge and -voted. He afterwards produced the letter to the election auditor-a functionary of whom more will be said presently -with this memorandum on it-'Allowed 8s. for expenses from Buntingdon, W, Thirkettle,' who was the clerk to aone Pead, Mr. Slade's agent for election expenses. The -election auditor sent the letter back for the signature of :Pead, who wrote under theoother memorandum-'Iallow Mr. Carter's claim to have 8s. for travelling expenses-L1 Pead.' On this being produced to the election auditor he paid the voter 8a. out of money fu-nished to him by Pea&d tAo wtion having been brought to recover penalties alleged to bave been incurred by reason of these acts, under the statute, the defendant submitted that there was no evidence againsthim to belaidbefore the jury; but the judge told them, first, that if they were satisfied that the de. fendant, by bimself or his agent, had promised money to -Carter in order to induce himn to vote for the defendanti they should find their verdict for the Dlaintiff, though Abe sum promaised was no more than the fair and reasonable expenses of Carters travelling from Enuntinedon to Cambridge on the day of eleotion, and back again afte4 the election to HuntinRdon; and (under another count) tlat if the defendant did, by his agent, give money to Carter -on account of-that is to say, that the mnoving cause of hii
Vvingit was-Carter's having voted for the defendanti hey should also find a verdict for the plaintiff, though thq money had been for only the fair and reasonable expenses, 2and though the defendant had honestly believed thaet hoa
wascomuultttug no offence Befor -h Couz of1
-the defendant objected to this direction, because the judge
had not left it to the jury to say weother the money had been paid corruptly; and it was also insisted that he on ht to have told tbe jury that the payment of those travelling expenses was legal, not being prohibited by the statute, but, on the contrary, appearing contemplated by the abovet mentioned proviso concerning 'legal expenses.' Whether
it was urged, the money was paid corruptly was a questiol for the jury, and here thc defendant thought he was right n paying it. To this it was answered that a man may dq * thinz corrupty, though he may think it legal; that hit believing an act not to be an offence does not make it the less so. And further, the payment of travelling expenses to 4a voter is illegal; the loiter in this case necessarily leading -Carter A.p supp thst hbis expenses would be paid only it * 'be votedor the candidate who was to psy them, tbus intefr
bring wsh that freedom of choice which the voter ought -to poeses I up to the t moment. After taking time to con. aider, the Court came to the conclusion a ove ated; saying also, that 'It must have been known to the Legi's 3ature that the payment of travelling exPenses had been
old legal; and it seemed strange that, if intended to be sbolutely prohibited, they should not have been proht. bihted in expreEa terms. The Court said, also, that tby attached nO wught to the proviso at the end of the second section, hich was nugatory, as might be ween by reading it adirmatively instead of negative y, thus-'thf A,ct shall extend only to ioney paid for illegal expens adding that it was an instance of wbat in very common
inamely, a superfoux proviso, ex miajori cautdd. One or the judga differed from his brethren; but owned that "i gonatruction of the atuto would Vake it aet harshlj', ao
"The fac's of this csee*'hould' be reU tonudderodby escdidTates and their adviset, in ordort6lavoid eren air approach to the confines of that illegality wohich they dimclo3e When the Act *vzs passing through Pakrliament it woa
proosefd either exprea. l to psrit or prohibit the payI
nt ofb&md fide traveling l wse but Parliament declined to do either, thus leaving it a matter of anxiout
nsibility for decibion in everyparticular case. Itis tbe expected that a sworn electioll commisd wortld inflict on a candidate the serioas penalties attaching to

o Te eighth section declares that no person having a olwhtto vote shall be liable or compenlalte, 'unless he sball. *onsent so,to act,' to serve a a special constable t or during

"The 11th section, for the more effectual observance of tbe Act, requires every returning officer in counties andp beroughs to pubdlsh, in Ieu of the proclamation or notice of election formerly used, those given in Schedule B., each aof hich explicitly notiflesthe penalties imposed on bribery, treating, and undae influence.
"bIt os, hi -vever, into the bections from the 15th to the 24th, both iclusive, that a candidate must look for the nev
lachinery constructed for the urpose of 'preventing m cr
rapt practices ln the eection ot members to serve in Parlament,' and 'diuinishing the expenses of elections.' A potent funchonarg, under the name of ' Election A,ditor,' or 'auditor of Election Evpenses,' is to be appointede annually by the returning officer. He must, on his appoint
sent, sign a declaratio 'rsolemnly and vcerely promising and declaring that he will well, truly, and faithfully, to thebest of his ability, in all things perfort the duties cast on him by the Act,'.

The same provision exists with respect to pay ments necessary to be hnade ',in ready money,' and wrhich ecannot be conveniently postponed.' Of all these expenses the election auditor is to make out, al a low to be inspected 'aby any person,' a full account, ,and publish a signed ab
stract of such accounts in the local newspapers, including; the amounts claimed and the names of the claimants
" No person shall pay, or agree to pay, any election expenses, or any money to procure or promote an election, except to the candidate himself, or to or underthe authority of the elechion auditor, except in the above allowved casesa and, moreuver, another most important feature of the new system is the, requiring a candidate 'before, or at the nomination, or as soon after as conveniently may be,' to declare in 'writing to the election auditor the names of his 'agents for election expenses,' whom he must also appoint in writing: and that ne has not appointed, and will not appoint, any other such agent, without so declaring him to the election auditor; and no other than agents so appointed shall have authority to expend any money or incur any expenses of or relating to the election, in the name or on behalf of the candidate; and such agents nust make out, to the best of their ability, to the election auditor, true and particular accounts of all such payments; and as soon as 'may be after his appointment, every such agent must make and sign, 'sincerely and solemnly,' the stringent declaration contained in the 31st section. FinaUy, those who propose and second an absent candidate, without his authority, may pay his lawful expenses, and, having agreed to do so, become liable to pay all legal fees and expenses incident to the election, on the same terms and conditions prescribed concernng agdents for election expenses appointed in writing by the

It was there decidedbthat the appointment, pursuant to the 31st section, of a person, as agent ' for election expenres,' does not constitut him an agent under section 36, to receive clalns against the candidate,-though the majority of the Court thought that the same person might act in both capacities, if duly appointed for both purposes
" Attention must be paid to the interpretation clause (sec. 38), particularly to the signification annexed to the vords I voter, ' candidate,' and ' returning officer;' to the wholly or partially repealed statutes enumerated in schedule A., and the two new forms of proclamation to be used respectiveIy in county electioas and notice of elections in

Sir,-Fermit me to correct a risstateinent in the report of the cororer's inquest on the above fire which appears in Zke Timms of to-day.
What I stated was, " that althoulgh a flre*escape had been stationed for three years past opposite the Elephant and Castle, the conductor had never received a call to any fire from the P division of police," upon whose ground the late fatal fire occurred. Many fires have occurred to which the fire-escape conductor had not been called at all; in other cases he bas been called by civilians, or by constables near his own station, who have accidentally, and after the lapso of some time, heard of the outbreals.

A Tiger Hunt In Demerara.-We have re-
A TIGaR Hmu nr DRAnn &.-We have received from Mr. Bunbury, of Plantation Devonshire Castle, the following graphic account of a tiger hunt, which took place in front of Bounty-hall on Wednesday, the 3d 2nst., and in which one of tho sportsmen, who was a little too precipitate, very rearly lost his life, and still lies in a most dangerous state. Iu the afternoon of that day, while three or four men were hunting for guacos, the dogs suddenly came Tp to a tigress and her cub, which they instantly attacked. The first dog that came up to the tigress was kiDed by a blow of her paw, and, seizing the dog in her moutht she carried it up a coarida tree which stood by. The cub, which was a pretty large one, ascended another tree. On the huntamen coming up the tigress dropped the dog, sprang down from the tree, and made off The two renam2ing dogs kept under the tree in which the cub was. A gun having been sent for, theyoung tiger was shot; it measured five feet from nose to tail, and was about the height of a full-grown spaniel. On the cub being shot the dogs followed the tigress, whioh had ascended another tree. The man fired again and wounded her, breaking one of her fore paws she fell down, but rose up again, and made for the
sea. Thetide being low, sbe stopped on the soft mud, where she was fired at with large shot, but with no effect. A man namved William Tait, hearing repeated shots fired, went with his double-barreled gun to the spot, and as soon as he canme up to the tigre"s, which was lying on the mnud amonu the young courida trees, he discharged both barrels, cried out "I bave shot it," and, without waiting for the smnoke to clear away, to scertain the effect ot the discharge, he sprang forward with the intention of seizing his
rey; butthe tigress, turning round, seized him by the eg of his trousers, threw him down, and bit him over the eye. The man buried bis face in the mud, and the ferocious animal bit him severely on his neck and head, and tore his scalp nearly off. While this fearful struggle was going on the otber men came up, and shouted at the tigress, which sprang offthe man, and after going about two roods asai lay down. At length, bullets having been procured, tne ferocious animal was killed. It was about the height of a Newfoumdland dog, and measured 7 feet from nose to tail. The animals were skinned and cut up. The skins were sold to Mr. Gonlding, of Plantation Fear Not, for $10, and the flesh, which was very fat, was sold in the neighbourhood. The poor man Tait is now lying in a very dangerous aXte, his head being swollen to an enormous size, with the scap lying loosely on it.-Demerara Royal Gazete.

THE .CIT. OF-..N >N. .
A meeting. called on behalf of the four "Liberal nan Cummercial Candidates," Was held yesterday at the CroWrn Inn, Redeross-street, Cripplegate Withqut,. and by saubsequent adjournment at the parochial schoolroom opposite. About 200 persons attended, many of whom belonged to the adjacent wards, and three of the four candidates were pre. s:nt to address the meeting,-viz , Baron Rothschild, Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Raikes Currie.
iMr. JOlsn DILLON ocoupied the chair, and briefly introduced the candidates.
Baron RoTHscuLmD, on presenting hinself, was received with loud applause. He remarked that 10 years ago, whea he first offered himself to the citizens as the representative of the great principle of civil and relgious liberty, his re. turn was mainly due to the encouragement he obtained in that ward. He hoped to have a renewal -of the same lind support on that occasion, and that they would
till enable him to fight the battle in their rame until it was victorious. He had already intimated that if the caus of Jewish emancipition were not carried in the ensuing session he should immediately place his seat at the disposal of the citizens. (Hear, lear.) It was not his intention to repeat the some process ashad been going on from year to year for a long time patliut his belief was that a veVr Liberal ParliAmentwas abont to be elected, which would forceupon the Governmentthe introduction of Liberal measures, among which would be the one involving his right to sit and vote. (Hear, hear.) Any division among Reformers was always painful to him, and te was sorry to see the omission of Lord J. Russell's name from their ticket. Having received support from Lord T. Russell in the House of Commons, and from the Liberal party in the city, it was not for him to say that they ought to vote against that noble lord. (Cheers and hises.) All he desired was that, in estimating the claims of each candidate they would well consider how the Liberal party might best be kept together. If this point were neglected, and they had hereafter to fight against Tories, they might have cauEe to rue tha' their forces had ever been divided. What. ever might be the result of that election, he trusted that the great principle of which he was the humble representatve would not be allowed to suffer. (Cheers.)
The CuAmLwu, after what had fallen from the Baron, begged to ask him whether he meant to act in concert with the other three candidates ?
Baron ROTscL=D was afraid he had been much misunderstood. What he had stated, or at least what he meant to state, was, that it ws not for him to say that they were s.ot to vote for Lord J. RuSell-ea man who had supported him in the House of 6ommons. (Cheers.) He left It entirely to theirbatter judgment to determnine howthey should exercise their suffrages. He did not say that they were to vote for Lord J. Russell, but he did not tbink that was say. ing they were to vote against him. (Cheers, laughter, and some confusion.)
An ELECTOR asked whether, if returned, the Baron was prepared to fight the battle of the constitution as Mr. Alder. man Salomons had done?
Baron RoTHscmELD did not approve the course taken by Mr. Alderman Salomons, which he understood had given more offence to the Peers than anything else, and induced them to vote against the Bill in favour of his persuasion. He distinctly declined to pledge himself to anything on this subject; but he might say he was for taking a more active and determined course next session than he had hitherto done. (Hear, hear.)
The same ELECTOR said, that the city required four bond fide members, and the question was, would the Baron in future be a de facto as well as a de jure representative! rn a word, if elected, would he take his seat and vote. (Cries of "Be can't.")
Baron ROTHSCeHLD was not prepared to say what his steps should be.
Mr. AYRTON (one of the candidates for the Tower Hamlets) hoped the meeting would not be led away by a question seemingly put only to create confusion. (Hear, hear.) The point raiEed by Mr. Alderman Salomons, depending on certain Acts of Parliament, had been tried in a court of law, and was decided against him, and it was imapossible for Baron Rothschild to take his weat without. anew Act of Parliament in his favour. (Cheers.) At the same timo tie Baron would doubtless do whatever any competent lavyer advised him in order to vindicate his-own rights and those of his constituents.
Mr. CRAWTFORiD, who was greeted with general applause, then entered into a brief exposition of the prsncisnes on which he based his claims to the suffrages of the citizens. Be was put forward as a candidate for the city in 1852 by gentlemen who were then dissatisfied with the state of its representation; but it was subsequently deemed advisable that he should postpone his candidature to a future occasion. That occasion had now'arrived, and he issued an address a fortnight ago, with which he trusted they were famili r. (Hear, hear.) He was an advocate of civil and religious liberty in its fullest acceptation, and also an earnest and thoroughgoing Reformer. Instead of trying to satisfy the public mind by bit-by-bit reforms, adapted to the mere reqwrements of the moment, he was for going at once to the root of the matter and dealing wdth the question in an effectual and condusive manner. (Cheers.) That yrincile he would equally apply to the army, tho navy, and to the administration of the law. He was a conscientious adherent of the ballot, to vote in favour of which was almost the ouly sct permitted to him before his brief Parliamentary career was abruptly cut short. (A laugh.) Any measure for the total abolition of church-rates should have his support. [A Voice.-" What about the Chinese war?'1 He for one declined to give any opinion on the merits of that war. That was a question of the past, and what they had now to deal with was how it had been treated, and, above all, how it was to be brought to a satisfactory termination? (Cheers.) If he had been in Parliament when the subject was discussed he should have voted for the Government. Having been in China some time and observed the state of aflairs there, he did not scruple to say that, if we wished to maintain our national character and credit in that quarter, we must resort to extensive measures to place our relations with China on a broad and peaceful bais-a basis so broad that there would be no fear of a renewal of the untoward events which had brought about the presint crisis. (Hear, hear.1 HedidnotprofesshimselfaP lmerstonian. Hedid not viewlord Palmerston as such a Reformer or such a politician as the country ought to be satisfied to have at the head of affairs; but in the present position of parties it was absolutely impossible to find any other Statesman who could carry on the Goverment effectively or creditably to the country; and therefore, although that noble lord's princi,ples fell far short of his own, he should give bin a general and independent, but not a blind suport. (" What about Maynooth?") He certanluy should not vote against Mr. Spooner's motion to inquire into Maynooth; but he thought the compact under which the annual graut was made to that College ought not to be set aside merely because it happened to be objection. able to a particular class of ticians on both aides. Asan " advanoed Liberal' and a =dical Reformer herespectfully asked for their suffrages; aud he also solicited their support for the three other gentlemen in conjunction with whom he was canvassimg, and whose sentiments were almost identical with his own. (Cheers.)
Mr. RAxxS CsGuRR next addressed the meeting, and said that, when he first complied with the requisition begging him to offerhimself as a candidate for that city, he distinctly understood that both Mr. Masterman had resigned and that Lord J. Russell did not intend to stand. He could easily have been returned for Northampton again if he had chosen, and he repelled with indignation the allegation that he now came before the citizens because be could not obtain a seat elsewhere. Moreover siice he had issued his addresshe had been offered the representation of Leeds on his own terms; but as a pledged man he could not retire from the city of London, aud therefore he had declinedso flattering an invitation. He had been described as Lord J. Russell's greatest antagonist, and certainly fromn O position that was straightforward and manly was he disposed to shrink. When there were four seats and five candidates each of the five mlght in one sense be deemed the opponent of all the rest; but he would not shelter himself behind that plea, and if asked whether, under all the circumstances it was expedient that they sbould again return the noble lord as their member he boldly answered "No." He had never professed himself a Whig; he had been a Radical ever since he entered the H5oueo of Commons, and when he was taunted with tbrowing off his allegiance to the noble lord he declared that he nad never owned any such allegiance. (Hear, hear.) bt was said that Lord 2almerston was not a Reformer, but never was the leader of any aristocratical party found to be aReformer, except upon compulsion, (Cheers.) Every
valuable measure of reform had been wrung by pressure from reluctant Ministers and Cabinets; and therefore, while he admired Lord Palmerston's foreign polcy, and regarded that nobleman as one of our ablest men, and the Statesman who best understood the character ot the British people, he said, as to the cause of domestic reform, that thaa ,was a questionnow entirely in the handsof the constituencies. (Cheers.) Having referred to the notion whichbhe carried
tams onpresene oveznzent inJuzlylaso hsaico the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill as a proof that he was no slavish adherent of the Premier, the hon. gentleman observed that he accepted the touching apologoe in which Lord J. Rossell had described himself as an old servant, and which reminded him (Mr. Currie) of the case of a friend of bis who had an old-fashioned but faithful butler in his employ, to whom all his other servants would leave no peace from morning to night, for no other reason that he could divine baut because he h the key of the cellar. The same individual also kept it little wiry coachman who was never easy unless he was on the bos (A laugh.) All of a sudden this gentleman heard a tumult below stairs as if all Bedlam had broken loose, and on going to ee wbat was the zaatter he found bis honest butler fiercely set upon by all his fellow servants, except the little vicious coachman who stood on the table, not, indeed, himself joining in the unmanly assault, but cheering on the rest (Laughter.) His fri3nd having rescued the butler from their clutehes kicked them all out neck and crop, and thua showed himself master of his own house. (Renewed laughter.) After leaving his heazers to draw their own moral from this anecdote, the hon. gentlomin yent on to tay that the Position he now occupied*as not of his seeking.

Russel from the imputation of factioai .oppoeition to the Government, and appealing to the citizens not to attempt to send the firs' gtatesman in England, and perhaps In Europe, to Parliament fettered and tied down as to every vote he should give.
1r. SA7ET, XMogizy, as a Dienter, had many faults to find with Lord J. Russell, but he honoured him for his vote on the Canton question, and regarded him as the representative at that election of what he held to be of paramount importance-viz., the independence of Parliament. With all iS shortcomings Lord John Russell had more aterling principle in his little fingcr than Lord Palmerston had in his whole body. (Cheers and hisses.)
Mlr. R. .l MOORX vindicated Mr. Carrie from the attack of 31r. Bennoch, and, having recornted the services of the other three candidates to the popular cause, moved an amendment pledging the meeting to use its best exertions to ecure the return of Baron Rothschild, Sir J. Duke, Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Carrie.
Mr. XNLXD seconded tbe amendment, which was put to a s how of bands and lost. The original motion in favour of Lord J. Russell was then submitted to the vote, sad carried amid loud cheers by a large majority.
A vote of thanks to the chairman ciosed the proceedings.
Another meeting of electors was held last evening at the North and South Americancoffeehouse, Threadneedle-street. About 70 persons attended. Lord C. 3. F. Russell, Sereant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, was present. Mr.
brahbam took the chair at 7 o'clock.
Mr. FJcHARDsoI moved the folowing resolution
'* That In the opinion of this meftlug the resolution of the Liberal egistrateon Association, condning the choloe of reprementatire for the city of London excluaively to commercial men I dlctatorI4 nmpo. lEi, and nnjwt, becana It limits the choioe to candIdate. ota v&rUcular class, and anskes the freedom and Indepedence of electoe a mockers and deludoeu."
Mr. BoRLLY seconded the resolution.
Several gentlemen expressed their dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Liberal egistration Society, of which they said they had ced to boe members.
Mr. PsYER proposed an amendment condemning Lord J. Rnssel's conduct in respect to church-rates and grants of public money to religious bodies, but the mnotion was eventually withdrawn and the resolution agreed to with only half-a-dozen dissentients.
Mr. PtITCHARD, High Bailiff of Sonthwark, moved the next resolution, recognizing the valuable services of Lord J. Russell to the LiberAl cause as member of Parliament for the city of London, and declaring that the meeting pledged' itself to use every exertion to secure his election.
Mr. CMLTON, in seconding the motion, complained that, with the exception of Mtr. 8alomons and Mr. Davis, no gentlemen of the Jewish persuasion had enrolled themelves upon Lord 3. Russell's committee, and that many of that body -were canvaing against him. (Cries of" Shame !") Lord J. RusseU had refused to accept any subscription in aid of his election expenses. He found the money for the necessary expenses of the contest, but he had refused to avail himself of the services of paid canvassers.
Mr. BXNN-Osio then addressed the meeting, declar'ng that an irresistible current was setting in in favour of Lord J. RusseL
The resolation was carried with only three dissentients.
Lord C. T. F. RUSSELL having been called upon by the chairman, said, that he had not intended when he lelt home that morning to address a public meeting, but he felt extremely obliged for the permission to sar a few word4. He hau been ver; m uch astonished at the magnificence of the warehouses ne had visited in the counrse of the day. He .Was also astonished to find himself at that hour (9 o'clock) still without his dinner, which was ol!ing to the fact that in going through some of the smaU alleys of the city he unfortunately found that his pocket had been picked. (Much laughter.) Ono gentleman who bad addressed 'the mneetin" seemed very fond of the Liberal Registration Society of th7 city of London. He also admired such an association in the abstract, and he could not conceive a better proof of the benefit conferred b that body than the fact that there should be five candidates in the field, and not a sincle Consenvative dared to shoW his face in the city of London.
That he admitted was very much owing to the gubeal: Registration Society. Bnt he held that they had committed a most grievons error in their conduct to his brother. (Cheers.) He thought it very hard that, after calling upon a public man to leave a borough where his seat was safe, he should be, after 16 years' faithful service, treated as he had seen in the House of Commons hon. members use .an orange-they sucked it that they might peak more loudly, and then threw it away. (Applause.) He had been astonished to hear one gentleman assert that Lord J. RuseU was not more favourable to an extensioa of the franchl4e than Lord Palmerston. Now, this gentleman ought to remnember that when his brother brought on his last Reformraill Lord Palmerston, to use a common phrase, bolted out of the Cabinet. (Laughter.) Again, when Mr. locke King brought on his motion, Lord P'almerbton went into the lobby with about 30-he could not call them Liberals (a voice, " Thieves I" and laughter), but Treasury men
at his back, while his brother went into the lobby supported by the great majority of the Liberal party. (Applause.) Butthen it was said his brother was not in favour of the ballot, Now, he was in Parliament himself once, and he differea from his brother on this point, for he always voted for tbeballot, (pplase. But if the electors were right in rejecting Loro 3. R for his opposition to the ballot 'then if it should happen that his brother-who was the fruit of the family while he was nothing bht the husk and rind -and hims'ef were candidates against each other for the representation, it would be the duty of the electors to reject his brother and take him, which he thotught would certainly be absurd. With regard to this question of the baUot, he had authority to state that the vice-president of the Ballot Society in the city, the treasurer, and several of the committee, had determined to support Lord 3. Russell, notwithstanding his opposition to the baUot. (Hear.) But was his brother so determined an opponent of the ballot as some gentlemen seemed to sump pose s He had heard his brother say that in the abstract e -was favourable to open voting, but that he sni"ht be driven to the ballot. (Disapprobation, and a cry, " de never will -be.") What did his brother say, at the London Tavern the other day? He understood him to say that when Mr. Heme stated that only one man in seven enjoyed the franchise he thought it only right that the other six should know how the elector voted. But his brothernow went a step further. He wanted to carzy a large extension of the franchise, and when two men out of seven, instead of one out of seven, had the powver of voting, the argumet against the balUot would not be quite so strong in his brother's mind as it was. (Applause, and partal disapprobation.) Situated as he was in the House of Comumons, he heard almost every word of the debate On the China question. Ho never remembered a resolution which bad less of a
rarty character. One member of his family-Mr. hastings Russell, who sat for Bedford8hireas a youn man, someti es asked his advice, hut upon ttis occasion ha voted for the Government, and did not sk his advice until after he hadl voted. (A laugh.) He then said, "How would you have voted ?' He (lord a Russell) replied that he sbould have voted with Lord John. It s said that tWis was a hostile vtote against the Government, bat he wai convinced that his brother had no idea that tho China vots would turn out the Government. Nay, more, it was onlylast night that his brother, not spealtingnpontheChina question but, alluding to Lord Palmerston's adr to the electors of Tiverton, said, " He is a little hard upon us here, fir he says that no oae ventured to impugn the policy pursued by the Government at Naples. But I took exception to it on the first night of the session, and spoke to Lord Minto on the subject; but I didnot do more, because if I had brought forward a motion the Tories would have voted with us, snd we should have put the Government in a minority." This would show that his brother had no animus against Lord Palmerston. He had, indeed, declared himself a friend to Lord Palmerston, and wished to be a good friend. to Lord Palmerston's Government. But it would wvant a sort of patting on the back, and perhaps a little pushing on. (A. laugh and a voice, " Lord John wants a little pushing on.") With regard tobchurch-rates, he never had a conversation with Lord J. Russell upon the subiect. but he knew thAt he was favourable to a settlement of this vexed question. How it was to be settled he knew not, but there could bs nothin" more unsatisfactory than the present state of the law. D.oud cheers.) Baron Rothschild, in his address, expressed his confidence that there would be a large majority of members favourable to Jewish claims in the next Parliament. But he thought it must have crossed the mind of Baron Rothschild that it would be mn:st galling to him if, in the moment of victory, bis brother wre not thare to share in the triumph. (Hear, hear.) He thought that if Baron Rothschild took his seat, and his brother did not walk up the floor of the House with him as representative of the city, Baron Rothschild's triumph would be very icomplete, man it would he a slur and stain upon the Jewish electors of the city of London. ( Applause, and aVoice '-An eterna.ldhsgrace to them.") One gentleman who had addressed them to.nighthad spoken of his brother as being " used p,"or something of that kind. Nowb, e saw
a g e gntl taig notes -whom he zem Zee;d
seen i the rdere gallery of the House of Com-
mons, and he woualtd k him whether Lord J. Rusells speech on the Chin s debate was not-r ht or wrong-one of the most powerful speeches he had ever deliveed in Parliament (Hear, hear.) The fact was there was an attempt to get rid of his brother by a sids- wind, and there were people who talked about "pletting i m down easy." He could not help thinkeng, when be heard such remarks. of a painting by Landseer of a niob, hound which had, been drivenL over a cliff. But the mot-to of the picture was " There is life in the old dog yet.' (Great applause.) Ile trusted that they would do his brother the honour, and he would frankly say themselves the bonour, of re-electing him. He conjursidthem to allowhim to devotet'he five or six years which, awn he said, mnight yet remain to him to their service. And hea hoped -yet to see his brother waak up the floor of the Hou-se, and tak-e his seat by the side of Baron Rothcid if, th~ elsectors of the city of London returned hm at h -presnt election. (Great applause.)
The proceedings + erminated with the usual voet of thaniks to the hair.
FIN,SBURY.
M1r. Serjean5t Parry addressed a meeting of the electors lSas evening a't the S3chool-room in Greenhill's-renti, Smithfield. Mr. YJ4ovd, of Gray's-inn,ipresided.

He was in favour of short Parliaments aDd of the admission of Jews into rhe Legislature. He should heartily aupportSir W.ClIy's Bill for theabolitionofchurchrstes,and believed that that question might have been long ago settled if the Government had earnestly endeavoured to put an end to tho injustice of compelling men to pay for the support of a form of religions worship from which they dissented. He should also vote for the aboUtion of the religious tests eracu ed at the unirersities and graimnar schools, and for redueed national expenditure, but would at the same time vigorously support the Government in maintaining the national honour. He regarded the income-tax as a tax upcn labour, and should therefore vote for its abolition. But if the majority of the House of Commons should vote for its continuance even after 1860 he should do all in his power to make it fall with less weight upon precarious than upon realized incomes. (Hear hear.) He regretted that the friends of his rivals, vu., iir. Cox and MA Reed, had damaged the cause of these gentlemen by endeavouring to adumniste him. They had said, but most untruly, that he was a Socialist, and a member of a sing-song and debating society at the Belvedere Tavern. o w, he had never sung a song in his life-and for a good reason, because he could not. (Laughter.) Mr. Cox had endeavoured to depreciate him in the eyes of the constituency by saying that e (Mr. Serjeant Parry) was a lawyer, and suggesting that he would sell them for a place; but Mr. Cox ws himself alawyer, although he wasnot a member of the bar. However, the electors of Finsbury might depend upon it that he (Mr. Serjeant Parry) was the last man to whom anything like a County Court judgeship would be offered by the G;overnment. The electors would not believe him if he said that he should be altogether blind to his own interests, but he should ever place their interests in the foregronnd. (Cheers With regard to his otber rival, M.jor Reed, all he would say was that he was, in fact, no major at all, for be was only Senior Major of the Banhifl-fields Artillery (laughter), and had, in the character of a Conservative, deprived one of the oldest Reformers in this country of his seat for Abingdon. He (Mr. Serjeant Parry) beheved that he should certainly be the colleague of Mr. Duncombe, because the personaslties to which the friends of his rivals had recently resorted showed that their cause was in peril. Cheers.) He bad throughout bis life, as tbe peoplo of Finsbury weU knew, consistently advocated those Liberal principles on which he was about to oontest the representation with Major Reed and Mr. Cox. (Cheers.)
On the motion of Mr. LwoYi, seconded by Mr. BARi, a resolution pledging the meeting to use every exertion to secure the learnersejeant's retuzn was passed amid loud cheers
Major REBD, ex-ILP. for kbingdon and one of the candidates for the representation of Finsbury, lat evening addressed a crowded meeting of the electors at Spafields schoolroom, Mr. David Chinery in the chair. The gallant gentleman professed himself to be in favour of administrative and Parliamentary reform, eivil and religious liberty, the abolition of Jewish disabilities, extension of the franchise, abolition of the income-tax, and the ballot. He was oposed to any system of national education, believing that tbe people ought to be allowed to educabe thelmelves, and that they would not fail to do so in a manner much better than any Government system could educate them. (Cheers.) He denounced the factious coalition against Lord Palmerton on the Chinese question, and heartily approved of Sir J. Bowring's proceedings at Canton, declaring that he should be delighted to have the opportunity of shootine that scoundrel Commissioner Yeh. (Laughter and cheers. He complained that Mr. Serjeant Parry had endeavoured to improve his cause by asserting tha the ( Major Reed) was not, in fact, am,ilitary man, and that he had no scars to show. Now, the truth was that he had served in the 17th Lancers, and he had quite as many soars to show as any Old Bailey lawyer. (Laughter.) He founded his claim upon the electors not noon what he promised to do, but upon what he had already done in Parliament. (Cheers.)
Several questions having been answered hy Major Reed to the satisfaction of the meeting, it was resolved unasnimously on the motion of Mr. THos. O'BRrsN, seconded by Mr
TEaIPLZ, that every exertion should be made by the constituency to secure his return.
THE TOWEfR HA[LEETS.
There are more signs of a contest as the day of election draws near. The usual appeals by plaards are.being made to the electors to vote "for Butler, the resident candidate," " for Clay, the long-tried representative," and " for Ayrton, and no Maynooth."
Mr. BuTrLEB addressed a meeting last night at the Eagle, MIile-end-road, recspitulating the principles upon which he was returned to the late Parliament. He complained of imputations on his attendance in Parliament, and. declared he had been present at more divisions than. at least, 620 of the 656 members. He had been absent from no division of an important character. He had voted for tho ballot, for the removal of Jewish disabilities, and for the withdrawal of the INfaynooth grant. He had spoken on al local questions affecting his constituents. He had assisted in defeating an attempt to qualify Government clerks with 300L. a-year salary for the magistracy; and he had endeavoured, thongh ineffectually. to strike out the Lords' amendment in the Metropolis Local Management Bill. He had certainly been ill for three weeks, but he Wanposedhewasnot tobecharged with te lect if his health ered in their service. (Hear. her.) e did not pretend to be a stamp orator. He told them he was no great public speaker when elected, and he had not deceived them. But he really thought they ought to pass a vote of thanks to any memnber who had sufficient discretion to hetain from wastingthe time which mighezmoro usefully be applied to practicallegidation. (Cheers.) Re had fulfie all the pledges he had given. He hadcarefully watched their interests, and he had been accessible at all times to his constituents. He wished to know vhether their member was not likely to have moro influence in the House of Commons if he came from Clapton than if he came from Madras or Bombay? Hle did not hold Mr. Ayrton responsible for the unfair statements of his friends, but he believed other tactics would better serve that gentleman's interests among such a body as the constituency of the Tower Hmlets. (Cheers.)
Resolutions approving . Butler's conduct were passed unanimously.
Sir W. CLAY addressed a meeting at the Earl Grey, Mile-end-road, last evening. He said that up to a very late period he had no reason to believe there would be any contest, and lie had been anxious not to call the electors from their pursuits unleis it became necessary to do so. The motion upon the China question which led to the dissolution was one of the most perplexing he had ever known submitted to the House of Commons. He did not find fault with those who supported the resolution of iMr. Cobden from conscientions motives ; but, in his opinion, it was dangerous to declare that the Britisb authorities in Canton had engaged inhostilitiesfor whieh there was nojustification. ALnoutragehad beercommittedonboard aBritishvessel and an insult had been offered to the British flag. No apology for the past could be obtained, and the guarantee for the future was doubtful. Perhaps the demandas for redress in the case of the Arrow might have been yielded; but Sir J. Bowring thought it a proper opportunity to insist on our treaty rights. There, he thought, Sir 3. BOWring erred in Judgment, but he did not think the exceedingly malignant and disineenuons attacks upon Sir J. Bowring fair or justifiable. (Hfear, hear.) -In his opiuion the resolution waS inexpediecnt, because it fettered the action of the Government and involved the necessity of concessions to the Chinese. It ws one of those trap vvwhich were constantly being laid in the House, ad for v hich the Opposition were always watching. There had been a great deal of indignation at the idea of coaUlton, but he had teen too much of the shuffling of the cards and the changes of parties in Parliament to be so innocent as to think that the chance of wbat might be got in a scramble for office was totally disregarded. (Cheers.) WVhen Lord Aberdeen's Government was broken up by Lord .Tohn Ruseell, when neither Lord John nor Lord Derby could form an Administration, when England was down hearted at tho calamities of her troops, Lord Palmerston took office, renovated our army, restored confidence to the country, and concluded a peace which thnse who deserted him said never could bo obtained. Since the peace Lord Palmerston had achieved a greater triumph than the peace itself. Russia had succeeded in suborning our allies i she had drawn France from otr side; Prussia was too timid to interfere; Sardiias hesitated, and Lord Palmerston, alone by a union of sagacity and frmnes, justly estimating the indomitable tenacity of his countrymen, succeeded in securing the true benefits of the -eace and driving Russia from the Danube. (Cheers.) These services shonld never be forgotten; hut le repudiated the notion that he was an undeviatiDg supporter of the noble lord or of any Government. He had little reason to thank Loid Palmerston for any courtesy with respect to the Church-rate Bill, as the noble lord had always evaded findiDg an opportmiiiy for bringing it on, although be had assented to the Bill with certain amendments, to which he and the advocates of abolition saw no objection. But on the church-rate question they could expectnothingfromordDerb, and Lord John Russell had made a epeech wvhich almost wvent to the extent of saying the abolition of church-rates was the first ste towards tbe abolition ef the monarcy, in. tie event of his roelection, Sir William pledged himselE to advocate religions reform without reference to the party in power. Citing Mr.
=zton's professions in favour of thebalot, of limiting the duration of Parliament, offurtberParliamentaryreform, and extension of the francbhie, he said, his opinions were idsa.- tihal with Mr. Ayrton's, the oely differenoc being that. wbat what Mr. Ayrton saidi he would promise, Sir. W. Clay had done, (Cheers) With regard to. the. cbarge of neglecting his Parliamentary duties, Sir Wilianm i-d ahe hated the sham, so coamonly practised, of rshing
into the House at divisions in oerer to stand wall wzh.con, stituencies; but, at the same time, he strongly asserted ha had never been absent on an important occsion. In co
clusion, he assure d the electors that whenhe could nolonersperform the duties of their representative he eAould 3ot need an opponent to warn kim to retire.
MIr. L%.ALU said, Mr. Ayrton did not oppeo Sir 'W, I Clay, hut Mr. Butler.
Sir W. CLA.Y believed Mr. &Irton would not be paebu ar as to which seat he seized. (A laugh. Heo bore onerruas testimony to tho Parliamentary conduct ol his bto col. league, whilehe earefullyguArded himself from tbo ,npcs tion that tbere was any coalition botween the. Ir w

Ast compelled to bow. (Cheers.
Sir 0. ArIER, on presenting himself, was received with repeated rounds of applause. He set out by observing Uat there were tbree candidates in tbe held wooing the " lady'
of Southwark." In prosecuting their claims it was thaor duty to show courtesy to one another, and therefore not a discourteous word should he say of either of the two gentle. men who were nowv opposing him. Devoting himself firit to domestic matters, which, rather unfortunately in his opinion, occupied more of our attention than foreign affair*, he observed that the most important object whioh recozamended itself to tbo consideration of every one was that of reforming all -existing abuses It was in the very nature of human institutions -tat abuses should spring up, and it was the duty of the Government, aided by' the people, to correat those abuses. He would not pull down our institutions because thoy were venerable from age, bet there were many defeots in the constitution which should be reformed as soon *a possible. (Cheers.) The first institution which should be reformed probably was the House of Commons; and in all meetings of the constituencies they should stipulate above all things for a reform of that body. But if they wanted to reform the House of Commons they mnst reform themselves, and must send members to Parltsa ment without that enormous expense which usally attended an election. (Cheers.) The first step towards this reform was the ballot; but he regretted to say that the suspport of that measure had not been what it should have been. Last year when Mr. Berkeley brought on his annual motion, ewing to some want of arrangement the division took place at a much earlier hour than was anticipated, and he (Sir C. Napier) and other ardent supporters of the ballot were unfortunately shut out of the House. Another measure of reform, which he would term the in,imsnm of reform, was that which had been proposed by Mr. Locke King; but he regretted to say that Lord Palmerston had put himself at the head of the Tories and had voted aghinst that measure. He (Sir U. Napier) supported Lord Palmerston -when he was right, but opposed him whenx he was wrong; and although there was a large amount of enthusiasm for Lord Palmerston throughout the country just now, he warned the people of England not to let it carry them too far. Let them say htordPalmerston, "If you will not advance we will go against oun;" and ceetainly he, for one, would not support his Lordship in the ensmng Parliament unless he showed himself a real, trne and sincere Reformer. (Loud cheers.) Beyond these me. sures in the direction of reform, he would xupport a household franchise and a great reduction of taxation. It was a fact that for years the estimates had gone on increasing whether we were at war or at peace; and although Russell, Gladstone, and Disraeli had all been Ministers, he had never heard that they were remarkable for economy; but the moment a general election was spoken of up they all started liLe a covey of partridges, and each of them associated with his name the cry of "reduction of expenditure." (Cheers.) He knew well enough that it was possible to maintain our navy and army in perfect efficiency
t a greatly reduced expenditure upon thoprsent estimate, but the fact was that our public establishnments required to be closely investigated, and they could only be looked into with any good result by members of the profession who were engaged in them. (Cbeers.) Reverting to the Chinese question, e stated that he had examined it with tho utmost possible attention. The altant admiral put the point very clearly-he held beyond dispute that the Arrow was a Britis registered essel; that though her register had expired, she had notbroken the law of Canton;thathervoyage had not concluded tll sho had returned to Hon,kono, and that under any circumstances the Chinese shoulP have soughtredregsfrom theBritishconsul Any clvilized nation would have done so, and if the Chinese were not civilized we should make them so. (Cheers.) Having puUed down the British flag, the Chinese refused the simple apolozy which was demanded of them; and he contended that his friend Admiral Seymonr, who was as humnane a man and aw good an offioer as any ran afloat, was perfectly justified in the measures which he had tken to bring the Chinese to reason. Hebelieved thatbefore longAdmiral Soymour womld succeed in his object, and that he would insist also upon the fulfilmaent of aU our treaties with the Chinese, which would prove an enormous advantage to the commerce of this country, and no disadvantage to the Chines. (Cheers.) Hle complimented Lord Palmerston upon his "plucky" conduct throughout the recent cra4roglios in which the country had been engaged; aud added his belief that the noble Lord would interpose to bring about amaicable relations bet-ween Sardinia and Austria, so as to prevent the peace of Enro;e being disturbed. The gallant admiral concluded an effective address by exhorting his supporters to be early at the poll on Mlonday next-an exhortation which was reponded to with unwonted enthusiasm.
On the motion of Mr. RBmsrz, seconded by Dr. EVANS, snd supported by MIr. HExsRsx the usual vote of confidence was passed in the candidate, and the proceedings terminated.
At the close of the meeting Sir Charles posted off to the Temuperance-hall, Fair-street, Horselydown, where he again addressed a numerous and enthusiastic audience.
Crowded meetings were also held vesterday by Mr. Locke at the Friar, Friar-street, and the King's Arms, Old Kent~.read; and by Mr. Pellatt, at the Girl's School Room, Union-street.
LA.MBETE.
A meeting of electors and others tooX place last evening at the Carter-street Hall, Walworth. Dr. Hunt was in the cbair.
Mr. W1IL'INSON, after explaining-and justifying his vote in favour of Uinisters upon the China question, touched r non the subject of the income-tax, his course with respect to which appeared to have disatisfied some of his constituents He taw the wals covered with placards about "Williams and no income-tax, " ocpel and no incomne-tax," and it almost seemed as though his opponents wished to convey the impression that he it was who had imposed this tax upon the country. Now, in 1851 and '5'2 a committee of the Houso of Commons had been arpointed to inquire wrhether this tax could nit be made more equitable in its pressure. Mr. Humue, Mr. Cobden, and Mr. J. . IRicardo were among the members, and went into that committee with a stron; persasion that the tax might be&xodified and re-adjusted They came out, however, with a very diferent impression, and all acknowledged that the difculties in the way were grexter thau they bad at all anticipated, As to the application of the tax to incomes of 11W. a-year he hbnnd that
fr. Williams was one of those who voted for rh. Gladstone's proposal to that effect; that lie opposed Sir Bulwrer Lytton's amendment to the effe¢t that it was exceedingly impolitic and unjUst to lovy this tax, upon ircornes so low in amount, and that this gentleman afterwards voted against a motion made by Sir FitzroyKelly with a view to the mitigation of the tax. Latterly, however, Mr. Williams appeared to have changed his mind on, this subiect, and proposed a resolution for exempting incomes under 1501. a-year. but he proposed it- at a time when the budeet was settled, and the state of tho HbusEf ot Commons rendored it impessible his resoltition should be carried. (Hear, hear.) Another question, that relating to the obaervance of the Sabbath, had given rise to some discussion in this borough. He (ir. Wilkinson) was of opinion that. it was desirable bD enable the working classes of thiscoiutry to visit tbe National Gallery, the British hsensm, or-oven the Crystal Palace on tho afternoon of Sundays. Rightly orwrongly, he held that opinion, and as an honest man therefore he did not shrink from doing what he could to carry it into effect. Therewere, howeTer, . great numberof persons in this country conscientiously opposed' to the- opening of these places on Sunday, and, fihaing this to botboecasoe Sir Josha I almaley, Mr. Fox, and ho bad come to the concls'sion that it was not right- to prosecute this question further in Thrliament while public opinion remained in.

The late m-embers for this borough, Messrs. B. Ms. Willcox and T. M. Weguelin, addressed a public meeting of the electors on Tuesday evening, at the Victoriarooms. There was an immense assemblage, including all the leading mem-
8ere of the Liberal party, now happily re-united. Admiral Sir Henry Prescott occupied the chair, and the two candidates having explained their Parliamentary conduct, a resolution of confidence in them and pledging their reelection was carried with the unanimous acolamations of the whole assembly, Captains Engledue and Strmtt, appointed as a deputation from the mueeting of mercantile mnen held on Monday afternoon, and reported in Trec Times of yesterday, attended and submitted the resolutions then adopted to the notice of Messrs. WiUcox and Weguelin, who both promisied to give their best attention to the question; and the former gentleman stated that his first knowledge of the movement was gleaned from the advertisement of te oresolutions in that morning's papers, and he had immediately brought it under the notice of the board of directors of the Peninsular aud Oriental Company, and got their resolution of support. This statement was received with great applause. The following resolution was aftervards adouted unanimously by the meeting
" That wllie thbi meeting is pleased to exprees its approval of tho foreign policy of Lord Palmerrton, it cannot but tegiet the oontinued apparent indiaelpWton of hin Lordsbip to support measures of political reform and social irprovement, aud sincerely beliove thsta large extenuOie of the suffrage, tho adoDtion ot the balot, the entire aboUtion of church-rates, an Immediate susrension of the rapid progress of Centralization, and a nautlonai sy.tem of unsectarlan education are obJecs desering the favourable oonsidertion of his LorIiy Government, and would, if carried into eftect by his Lordshi, tend materially to enlarge the a of poutical uberty, prelent the acerbitles and exerciEe of religions animosity, give stabity to the tine-honoured institution of sdf goernment and thus promote the happness aud well-boing of ti clases of Her Majesty's subjects."
There is not the smaUest chance of an7' opposition being offered to Meessm, Wifllox and Weguelin s re-election.
WALLNGFORD.
A meeting of the electors for the borongh and district of Wallingfora was held in the Corni-excbange, on Tuesday evening last, to hear addresses from Mr. B. alims, the late member, and from Captain Sartoris, the new candidate.
Mr. MAiNs began his address by congratulating the meeting upon the absence of that bitter strife and rancorous feeihng whlch characterized former contests in the borough.
hon, and gallant opponent, Captain Sartoris, laid claim to the support of the constituency on the ground that he was a supporter of the policy of Lord Palmerston, and that be was in favour of an extension of the franchise. Now, if any of them supposed that he (14r. Mllins) bad any very great regard for or attachment to the franchise as settea by the Reform Bil, or if any of tlaem believed that he thought it was fnal, he assured them they greatly misinterpreted his feelings. He was Rrepared, for one, 'when it could be " safe and progressive, that an extension of the franchise should take plae. (Cheers.) He was by no means satisfied that the final an4 perfect wisdom of human nature was embodied in the Reform Bill of 1832. On the oontrary, he believed In many instances that the franchise might be extended with signal advantage to the country, provided that it could have its proper safeguards. After explaining at some leugth his views with regard to the extension of the franchise, which he believed were in accordance with the general rogress of education, Mr. Mains went on to say, providd that the eloctive franchise should embody the principle of education, and was given to those whose position in life, whose education, whose intelli
enoe, and whose habits qualified them to exercise it, so far from being wedded to the Reform Bill, he would give his cordial support to any measure that gradually extended the franchise of England. (Cheers.)
An Eleotor asked MIr. Malins whether, aa education at present existed, he was in favour of an extension of the frachise.
Mr. XtUNZ said he was. He believed that as education advanced, so we might safelyadvance in the extension ofthe franchise. ICheer&) The subject of church-rates was onewhich interested a large number of that constituency, and he had given hi best attention to it. The extent to which his hon. and gallant opponent had expressed his opinion-namely, for a total and immediate repeal-he (Mr. Mains) had not hitherto been enabled to go. He was willing to believe that he was himself wrong,butstilithe opinion he entertained awas shared by a large portion of the ceople of this country; and that was that, inasmuch as church-rates, like many other imposts on land, are anL impost subject to which land is bought, the purchaser has no right to complain that that impost is continued. ("Hear," and disapprobation.) M1r. Mialins then entered into a defence of his vote against Government on the Chinese question, and remnarked that, though he believed in the
irst instance the Chinese were wrong and did offer an insWult to the British flag, yet Sir John Bowring and AdmSira Seymour did enough to maintain the honour of England by the seizure of two or three war junks, and Sir John ought to have written home to England for instructions before he proceeded to bombard the defenceless city of canton.
Captain SARTORIS addressed the meeting, and said he came to seek their suffrages as a supporter of that Minister who had done more to maintain British honour and interest abroad than any Minister who had been at the head of affairs for many years. (Applause,) As to the Chinese question, he beheved that Sir John Bowring was right in
e course he took, and that the Government were bound to support their representatives abroad. (Cheers.) The gallant catain proceeded to declare himself to be an advocate for cil and relgious liberty, and in favour of an extension of the franchise. It was the sincere conviction of his own mind, he observed, that church-rates ought to be abolished ano e sh old give his upport to any measure having that oegct in viewv. (Cers.
Both candidates were warmly oheered at the close of the meeting. The nomination is fixed for Friday, and the polling will take place on Saturday.
STAMFORD.
On Tuesday night a meeting was convened at the George Hotel, in this town, for the purpose of receiving the borough members, Sir Frederick Thesiger and Lord Robert Cecil Mr. Phillips took the chair, and introduced the two hon. gentletmen.
Sir FREDERICx TEaSIGER was received with applause. He said, they had been favoured that day with an opportunity of seeing the manifesto of Lord Palmerston to the electors of Tiverton, announcing that the dissolution had taken place for the purpose of enablng the electors of the united kingdom to express their opinion upon the existing state of affairs. He believed that this representation was not strictly correct, inasmuch as the dissolution took place in consequence of a censure which had been passed upon the Government by a majority of the House of Comnions, from their having sanctioned some most unjustifiable proce. dings of their agents in a distant quarter of the globe. But he was content to accept the ground which wos stated by the noble lord for this dissolution. After referring to the coalition -which had thrown out the Administration of Lord Derby, the right hon. gentleman went on to say,-Therewere oneortwomeasoresto which he must advert as part of the matters which came under their consideration. lIn the ft tplace, the succession duty, which gave rise to considerable reeling, to grat opposition, and which he was perfectly satisfied must efore iong he found to be so intolerable a grievance that, if not altogether abolished, it must be considerably mitigated. But there was another measure to which he wished to advert, because it had a more important bearing upon the position in which we now stood,-that was, the income-tax. Sir Frederick sketched the history of this impost, and havinDg desoribed the construct;on of the Government, Sir Frederick said he would venture to glauce first at the domestic policy, and secondly at the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston. In the frst place, with regard to domestic peliy, if it deserved such a name-for he was utterly at a loss to know what was the policy of the noble lord, and how it was to be described--during the year 1855 war was raging, and it was not to be expected that any measures of a domestic character should be passed in Parliament. Afterwardsthers were bilsintroduced, inthe firstplace upon the law of partnership; the Bill was withdrawn. Anoth er Bill was introdnced; that Bill was afterwards abandoned. There was a Bill for the reform of the Ecclesiastical Courts with respect to wills and administrations; that was abandoned. There wa a Bill introduced upon the law of divorce; that was withdrawn; a law for abolshing local dues; that
was abandoned; for the reform of the corporation of Lo.
don; that shared the fate of the others; and, in short, without weing his hearers by going through these various measures an aetai3, it weas sufficient to s4y that among those recomnmended in the speech from the Throne there were no less than 20 Bills whichwere introduced by the Government during the session of 1856, and which were all of them withdrawn, Now, one naturally asked, why was this? Why should measures, which evidently had been anticipated, and which had been intended to be introduced, and which, therefore, must have been in some degree prepared, why was it that they all fell in this reMcarklable manner? Why,-it musthave been owing entirely to the course which tho noble lord bad invariably pursued xice he became the head of the Government. -He had never exposed himself to any defeat. If he saw any opposition he yielded to it immediately. He throw himself upon the support of that party which he found to have the majority. He had been ever strong upon the stronger side, but he had never upon any occsion, when ho could fairly avoid it, exposed hituelf to the danger of having his Governrent overturned by a vote of a majority of the House of Commons. An extraordinary ilustration of that occurred in the last session. A bill was introduced by Mr. Locke
inugof a most democratical charcster. It was a bUll for the PurpSte Of enabling all lOf. householder to have a vote for countiet. He (Sir Frederick) had no hesitation in saying that,' if such a bill were allowed to pass, it would utterly overturn the baance of the constitution, Lord Palnmerston could only commanid among his supporters 31 votes, 21.of whomawereoulEcial1 persons, He threw himself upon the support Of the ConservatiYe party, and they ,enabled him to Defet tho imeasre bylamajority of 192
2 int 178, all of whom were the usual supporters of the nobles 101-d, It was quite evident, therefore, that, with -regard to mnateria chones --matters of vital mno3nent to the eonsttution, had no sort of aeot-
asy to any course thiWnoble lord might adopt, Xow turn to hisa fOreignpolicy. He tbought it might be - finly-rbaracteriedAis. a. moat vicios intermedalliig 'withet-her States, and a course of strung auid veheesent jirtimidatiusi with respect to those natlons which were not in

Sir Frederick here quoted a portion of Lord Palmerston's address to the constituency of
liverton. Moro unmeaning declarationshe thoughthe never read. He(Sir Frederick) did notwish to be misunderstood in regard to the war with China. We had entered into it moso unhappily, most unfortunately; but, at the same time, havmg entered into it, it was absolutely necessary that we hould continue it with vigour. Then he feared the result must be that that admirable sebeme by which the odious income-tax wae to determine in the year 1860 would entirely fall to the ground. The China wara war at such a distance-musti necesarily be a very expensive one, and we should require all the means which our ordinary and extraordinary revenue afforded us to maintain that war with roper vigour. In conclusion, Sir Frederiok said ewouldnot for one moment attempt to explain what would be the course which he should pursue if he had the honour of being again elected to represent the borough of Stamford in Parliament He had now been for some years a member of Parliament; his constituents knew the course which he had rmed from the beginning to the end of his career. He bl=eved hehad nerer deviated from the principles upon which he set out, and those principles he ould rnaintain as long as he had the honour of a seat in the Eouse. (Loud cheers.)
Sir F. Thesiger's address occupied upwards of an hour.
Lord R. CEciL then briefly touched upon a few of the questions discussed by his hon. colleage, and was well received, the assembly evincing by their accamations their approval of the sentiments of both their representatives
The meeting separated at 10 o'clock.
BRADFORD.
fr. H. W. WicsRAXt, the Conservative candidate, addressed about 1,800 persons at St. George's Hall, on Tuesday night, in explanation ef the coursc vhich he has pursued during the time that he has been one of the representatives of Bradford, and of the principles by which he intends to be guided if again returned He paid a high tribute to Lord Palmerston for his successful termination of the Russian war and for his satisfactory adjustmentof the Amencan difficulty, and the settlement of the war with Persa. Referring to the war with China Mr. Wickham raid, he considered the conduct of SirJehnBowring perfectly right and justifiable, and expressed an opinion that he had acted in a manner becoming the interests and honour of this country, and that if he d done otherwise more blood would have been shed than had already been. He declined to pledge himself to details as to his future Parliamentary career, but concluded his speech by quoting the passages in Lord Palmerston's address to the electors of Tiverton in reference to his Lordship's foreign and do. mesti poHly, with every word of which he said he entirely agreed.
A resolution pledging the meeting to support Mr. Wickham at the forthcoming election was carrried nes. di*, and there appears every probability of Ir. Wickhas and General Thompson being returned unopposed.
General Perronet Thompsonhas addressed rd meetings of the electors and non-electors during the week.

HALIFAX.
The Right Ron. Sir Charles Wood, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Mr. Frank Crossley M P, attended at the Odd Fellows Hall, on Tuesday night, for the purpose of rendering an account of their past stewardship in Parliament Mr. Joehua Appleyard, ex-mayor, presided. There were about 2,000 persoas crammed into the edifice. This overcrowding occasioned from the commencement great confusion, and it soon became evident that anything like a patient hearing would be out of the question.
Sir C. WoOD, after an enthusiastic reception, essayed to address the meeting. The light hon. gentleman reminded the electors that nine times previously he had been sent as their representative to Parliament, and he expressed his trust that ne had not betrayed that confidence liich they had so often placed in him, and that no portion of his conduct was such as to forfeit at their hands a renewal of that belief which he felt to be one of the proudest that could be conferred upon an Englishman-the cenfidenco of a large, an enlightened, and an able constituency.
The crowding and confusion became so great that the right hon. gentleman was unable to proceed further, and the Chairan dissolved the meeting until the nomination. It wYas understood, however, that a meeting of the electors only would be convened in the meantime by ciriular. In the course of his published address Sir dharies ob-

ESSEX (SOUTH).
The representation of the southern division of the county of Essex is to be the asbject of a contest, and the late Conservative members, MrT. W Bramston and Sir W. Bowyer Snsijth, are opposed, almost at thelasthour,by Mr. R. Baker Wingfield, who seeks the suffrages of the electors on extreme Iaberal principles.
The frst meeting of the electors, convened by the committee of Mr. Wingfield, took place last night in the Assembly-room of the Yorlshire Gray Hotel, Stratford.
Mr. Edward Gunmey was called to the chair.
Mr. WrN GFThLD remarked that it was for the electonl body now to decide whether the present Government was deserving the coafidence of the country. By the rinciples of civil andrelgious libertyhewould be guided, if honoured with that confidence which he aspired to. With regard to the extension of the franchise, he had expressed his sentiments in the broadsheet of his addres BHe should have supported, had he been in Parliament, the principles and provirona of the meauure popularly known as Mr. Locke King's measure. (Cheers.) n the
ueation of the malt-tax he would urge the reduction of t%at duty, as a necessary conseoqence of free trade principles. With reference to e church-rate questionthough holding a sincere devotion to the church, he would not ask a manto contribute to the fabric who declined to acknowledge its pre-emmnence. On the subject of the income-tax, now thatpeacehad arrivedhe stated as aEgeneral principle, it ought to be settled ina manner comptible-with the true interests of all classes of the community. As an Englishman he did not like secrecy, and therefore he was oppoeed to vote by baUlot.
An elector inquired how Mr. Wingfield would vote on the question of Jevwsh disabilities?
Mr. WiyGFiXLD had no objection to the admission of Jews into Parliament.
In answer to several electors, by whom thebhon. candidate was rather severely catechized, Mr. Wingfield declared that had he been in Parliament he should have voted with Lord Palmerston against Mr. Cobden's motion on the Chinese question; that he would not disturb the Maynooth grant; that, with regard to the dowry of the Princess Royal, he was aware that if the monarchsy ws to be maintained its scions must be supported; and that, with regard to administrative reform, he would apply a chloride which should destroy even the very smel of jobbery. With regard to the property qualification of members of Parliament, he held that to be necessary; but he would ao his utmost, f returned, to lessen and diminish the expenses at present entailed upon candidates.
The croms-osannination of the hon. gentleman having con-
Mr. S. .ARRISON moved a resolution,-

Mr. AsHDowNi seconded the resolution, regretting Mr. Wingfield's opposition to the ballot.

GLADDING moved as an amendment, that the meetiDg having heard with regret the answers which had been Riven by Mr. Wingfield with referenoe to the questions of the ballot ani church-rates,was not prepared to support any gentleman who would not at once abolish church-rates, and give the nation the protection of vote by balot.
The amendment did not find a seconder, and after some discussion the original resolution was carried by a large and overwhelming majority.
ORPHAN WORKING SCHOOL.-The centenary fes-
OrP}HAI WOR}mG SC&ioL.-The centenar festival of this institution was held yesterday at ths London Tavern, the Duke of Argyll in the chair. This institution originaUy founded a school in Hoxton for the reception of 20 poor orphan and destitute boys. In time 20 girls were admnitted, and, the number of pupils atill increasing. a building was erected in the City-road in the year 1775. In the year 184', the number of pupils having aain considerably increased, a nowr site was found for the school on Iaverstock-hill, aud at preaent there are in the school 169 boys and 78 grirs. It was propoeed to celebrato the centenary of the ch,.rity T enlarging the present building to
accommodate 400 children. After the usual loyal and *apropriate toasts the national anthem was ung by the cmldren of the school in a manner which elicited the praise of all present. Tho musical arrangementN were under the direction of' Mr. Turner, ssisted by Masters Corri and Bennet, Mr. Holmes, Mr. Seymour, and Mr. Lawler.

*CITY Or TOnnnTk:
The cavass for the different candidate is steadily pr. ¢eeding, and the adherents both of Lord John Ruxell and his four competito are equally sanguine of uccess. The canvass fw the "Liberal and Commercial" candidatos appears to be more systematic and better organized than that for the noble lord, who dispenses with the assiatance of paid canvasers, and depends entirely on the efforts of a corps of volunteers Indeed, the noble lord's committee, unable or declining to solicit every elector's "vote and Interest " petsonally, have aent round printed circulars to each of them, enclosing a form expressive of an intention to vote for him, which they respectfully request may be S1Ued up wvith the signature of the receiver. The Registration Aswesation, therefore, relying on the greater Tigilance and method which seem to mark their operations, speak with muea confidence of the result, alleging that their men have secured two promises where Lord John has ob. tained one. The noble lord's partisans, on the other hand, are in no degree dispirited or dissatified with their pros. pects. According to their own account of their progress, everything augus well for the return of their candidate, and every day that passes only discloses a wider spread determination on the part of the citizens to resist 1 the dictation o, a clique." The ward of Cripplegate Without is regarded as an important strategical podtion by both parties, and more than one tough trial of strength has taken place between the combatants. The friends of Lord J. Russell appear to have the mastery at this point, and two vigorous assaults in the shape of publc meetings, the last of which was held yesterday afternoon, have failed to dislodge them.
WESTMINSTER.
All intention of opposng the re-election of the late members, Sir De Lacy Evans and Sir J. V. SheUey, seems to have been abandoned. Mr. Westerton's committee held a meeting yesterday, when reports were presented froast which it appeared that while upwards of 3,000 electors had signed the requistion requesting that gentleman to come forward, or had pledged themselves to support him, the pecuniary assistance promiqed to defray the expense of ;cortestdid not exceed 3001. Mr. Westerton stated that, although he had been prepared to fight an electors' battle, and felt highly flattered by the compliment paid him by those who had invited him to come forward as a candidate, he did not feel warranted, underthe circumstances, in incurring the expense which inevitably attended a contest for a metropolitan borough. There can be little doubt, therefore, that Sir De L. Evans and Sir J. V. Shelley will again be returned.
MARYLBBONE.
The calm which has reigned over Mfarylebone since the dissolution of Parliament was a deceptive one, and the borough has narrowly escaped a contest after al. It appears that Sir B. Hall's conduct in the Sunday band affair gave great offence to a portion of his constituents, who carried their displeasure so far as to contemplate his expulsio from the representation, and during the last two or three days a process ha been going on which, snce the words " coalltion" and " combination" are, for a time at least, struck out of the language, it is rather difficult to describe. The result, however, was, that a requisition was set on foot to Mr. Hoare and Mr. Bevan thebankers, to offer themselves as candidates, and yesterday morning, in anticipation of their consent, the parish of St Pancras, to which part of the boronX the movement has been principally confined, was liberally placarded with appeals tothe electors to vote for " Hoare and Bevan and one day of rest in the week." It may be presumed that the requisition did not obtain many signatures, for it never reached the stage of presentation, ana Messrs. Hoare and Bevan, on being appealed to yesterday afternoon, denied all comnexion with
e would-be requisitionists, and repudiated the intention of opposing the old¢candidates Whether the malcontents wll acquiesce in this break-dowfn of their scheme or seek new candidates remains to be seen, but they have not much time left for consideration.
OXFORD UNIVERSITY,
The Vice.ChanceRor has appointed Friday, the 27th inst., for the nomination of candidAtes as burgesses for the IUniversity. It is understood that no opposition will be made on the present occasion to the return of both the former members, but much dissatisfaction has been expressed by avery large body of members of Convocation at the existing state of the representation of the University,
moreparticularlyinregardtoMr.Gladtone. Arequisitlon on. beal of an inauential body of the electors was made to Dr. Twiss, the Regias Professor of Civil Law, on Satarday last, to allow himsf to beput in nom ination, but, on consaltation with his friends, r. TwiSS has declined to allow himself to be brought forward on so short a notice to the con. stituency. There are upwards of 3,400 members of Convocation, of whom only about 2CO are resident, and the latter are at this moment dispersing for the Easter vacastion, while the lawyers are on circuit, and the clergy are more than usuay confined to their parishes by the duties of the season of Lent.
ArINGDON.-Mr. Ralph A. Earle, of Newbold, leamiagton, has droped down upon this constituency at the last moment, anv it is understood, will fight the place, on independent Conservative principles, with Mr. J. T. Norris, the Liberal candidate. Smce Mr. Burr's retirement several other gentlemen have been in the borough with an eye to therepresentation, hut, although itis believed thatthe majorityof the electors are yet unpledgsd, some chilling inanuence has operated, and, after a visit to those magAnates
eho are supposed to be interested in opposing Mr. Norris, they have departed.
ArosHON-uNDr -LNx-Mr. C. Hindley, who has represented this borough for 22 years, is the only candidate in the field. In his address, dated the 23d inst., he says:-
" Jwute to al eamea is my motto; peac, ecooomy, and reform are mywatchwords."
BIDGWAAT .Candidatesfor the honour of representing this borough in Parliament are sufficiently numerous to afford the electors abundant choice. On Monday xr. Kinglalke (author of Bothen) and Mr. Otway, of Stafford,
isited the town w;ith a view of canuvassing the constitaents. Besides these gentlemen, there are four candidates canvassing-namely, Major Graham, Mr. J. Curling, of London, Mr. Follet, and Colonel Tynte, the present members. Colonel Tynte has only just issued his address. He re-
"Although abhcring war for the purpose of ambition or aggresion aswicked and unebristlanlike, I have on the fullest oonviction (after the moo attentive consideratio.) sauDppted Lord Palm erston in the Jae straggle in the Ho-use of otmmons, belieavg him to have nobly upheld the Rag and honour of Fngland in supporting those in whose cbarg were ths lives and propertr ot ramny ot our countrymen."
DXiRBysnng (NoRTHc.)-Mr. W. P. Thornhil (Liberal) has issued his address to the constituency. He refers them to his votes in proof of his constant saupport of the best interests of the country, and promiises, if they again return him, that he wMll doall that lies in his power to obtain for the county what it is " really and earnestly looking for,economy, peace and reform." He does not referin any way to the Chinese question, or to the dissolution of Parliament. No signs of opposition yet appear.
DrsBYsHiz (SOUTH).-Mr. Evans, one of the Liberal candidates, has been making aotive exertions dtring the last few days to get in advance of his competitors. Mr. Evans is a supporter of Lord Palmerston, and a resident candate, and his canvassing has hitherto been most successful
Don r.-The Hon. W. H. B. Portman, son of Lord Portman,is proceeding with a thorough and,so far, successfu canvass of the county, in oDposition to one of the sitting members Mr. Portman lately sat for the borough of Shaftesbury. In his address he says:-
" yr tntention was to offer mysef to my present hind constituents. whie co-opeatng Wmit jou In Your efforts to return a member for this county of similr opinions to mny own on the grAt ruestlon on which the country is now about to pronounce it judgment ; but, in I deference to the wisbes of those electors wbo caa upon me, I am ro.
ured to sgve them the opportunity of onoe more assertIng the Independeuxs of tbha county bY recordlng their votes at the present crisis I voted for Lord Palmerston's policy In the recent war with China. as I believed it to be in cordance with true English spirit, and the seafest ourse that could have been adopted in the diffieult proition of affalssI also gavo him my gupport, becatue, in my opinion, the country owes him a debt of gratitude for his conduct of the war with Rsts, and forbisefficient support of Proteetantism. Experience convines me of the need of rigd economy in the expendature of the country, so far as the maintenance of effeetive establishments sor miltary, nava, And civil services wil permit; but I am prepared to maintain the proportion of direct to indirect taxation.which wIl render the burden as little oppressive to the community as is consistent with upholding the credit of the country."
Dusr,A CITY.-Mr. Mowbray, one of the late members, addressed a numerous meeting of the constituency on Tuesday evening, Mr. Wf L. Wharton, of Dryburn, in the chair. Ir. Mowbray referred to the Canton question at length, defending his vote i favour of Mr. Cobden's resolution. He stated that if Lord Palmer^ton had rannounced his intenton to send a plenipotentiary to China he would have voted with the Government.
DuRHAm (SOUTH).-The contest for this county will be severe, but the return of Lord Harry Vane and Mr. Pease may be considered certain. All three candidates are bly engaged canvassing and addressing the electors at the dfferent polling places in the division. Mr. Farrer explins that ho could not make up bis-mind on the Chinese question, and so he abstained from voing. lMr. Pease deelinestogive his unconditional support to the ballot without further consideration, though he professes himself a most strenuous supporter of civil and religious liberty, and general in faorof thoroughgoing Ltberal principles. Eis
speecn, whion was temperate and to the point, was receiVed with much favour.
HYTHX.-Mr. W. G. Thompson, who came forward as a candidate under the auspices of the South-Eastemn Railway Company, of which he is a director, has retired after two days canvassing, the result not being satisfactory. The new candidate, Calonel Atchieson Hankey (brother to the banker of that name), has addressed the electors at considerable length. He profeses himself a warme adnmirer of Lord Palmerston, and pledges himself to support his Lordship's Government. He adds:-" I am totally unconnected with any elass intereEt whatever. I an a friend to liberal though not to lioentious measures." Canvassing is going on freely, and both parties speak in high terms at their success. It s, however, believed that Sir J. W. Ramsden, with the influence of Lord Radnor and the late member, will be the successful candidate.
LteCAlt (Nors).-Lord Cavendish, the Liberal cendidte, has addressed the electors at Bumiley and Calne Sir J. P. KiayShnttlewvorth and Mr. R. Sagar presiding. His Lordship declares himself a eardial supporter o1 Lord Palmerston's Government.
LINrcoL1 (CrrY.)-.-Mr. J. Hinde Palmer has addressed the electors mn the Liberal interest in opposition to the late members, lfessrs. Sibthorpe and Heneage. Colonel . C,
Sterling, of Knightsbridge, London, has withdrawn his claims, fearful lest his interference might injure the Liberal "Unse.
LftcoLw (CouN'TY.)-For the northern division of the county it is now decided that there will be no contett. Iu the southern division M1r. Packe is making a galant fight. Personally popular, he bas a great advantaep in public
ceetings; in acme districts lie ie saidbyhis friends to be carrying all befon him, but the array of influence against
im veryformidable. Theofriendt of SirJohn Trolope and Mr. Willson are vey saguie that they can caTy both those gentlemnen.
LISXgAID.-A moat extraordinary contest is going on in this borough, and one which more than any other single act proves the fact of a "coalition" against the Government. Mr. K?. W. Grey, who has long been connected with the Ministry, and is now Secretary to the Poor Law Board, is opposea by the HoD. Arthur Gordon, sonof Lord Aberdeen, upon principles which, if not entirely those of Mr. Ernest Jones, re certainly worthy of the designation " Chartist." Mr. Gordon is said to be in favour of the ballot, of universl suffrage, and, in fact, of the whole Chartist creed. Mr. Gordon sat in the last PArliamTnt for Beverley, and, it is needlefs to say, voted against the Government upon the China question.
MoNTGosztRY Bolnouor-The zhtaement put forward that Mr. Pugh would be opposed is without foundation.
NORFOLK (EAsr).-Mr. Bxrroughes the late Conservative member, has isued a retiring address, in which he observes-
" I cannot allow my poUtical co rnnexlou with yen to ceas without endenrouing to disabue your ainds an the subject of the vote I gave on the Chln, question. Lord Palmerston Is doubUes at this imoment oonsidered a high authorir, but It was unbecornings man In Lord Palmerston' !postion to make a general custion ol oeacy and oombinatioa a*rlast all thoee who voted inathe majority on that
don. Nor myself I eau solemrly declare that In giving my vote I had no dedre to dIsplae Lord Palmeeton's Government, leastof all that Mr. Cobden, Mr. finer Gibson, Mr. Glastone, IDrd J.Tlnsse11,orSirJ.Grahcm shoeuldsrplanthim; nd lecldmotat the timae ee, and I cannot row understand, how the sucoess o Mr. Cobden's motion could have a tendency to advance the advent to power of thoe gentlemnen wbhoe politues ae in unison with my own. To the beet ot my recollection the only gentleman who diring the debate express a strong desire to see a Conservative Government on theJ Treasury bench was the Member for West Nostolk (Mr. Bentinek), and he voted in the minority with Lord Palmer.toa. My object in roting as I di was to irduce Lord PNlmrtoa to do that which I thought he ought to have done In the firt instance, and which he has done since. The publSe domesats on Chnb are Tolu. minong. but I wjl givean extrtct from them. On the l1th of October Sir J. Bowrng wrote to the English Consul Parkes I- The Arrow a norigbt to hoist the Brish lag. ThelSoenuetodosoexpiredon,te 27th of Sevtember, from whbih period she has zot beem entitled to ProtesctIo.S On the 14th of November following be wrote to the Chinee Commisioner Yeh:-'The Arrow lawfully bore the British fIag under a register gran ted by me. Now, it, Is believe to have been the cawe. tbe bloodshod and misery to Enagh residents In China, Oa well as to the Chinese, have been occasioned under a fale pretence (and both letters eannot ba true), I put It to you
Englishmes, s men of common semse onaversant with the management of your own busines, whether such a modo of managing the affairs of this coutry In a large empire at a distance merited the unqualified approbation of the Govremmett at home."
Sir H. Stracey has also published a retiring address, in which he expresses his thanks for the confidence hitherto reposed in him by the electors, and his hope that he has performed his duty to them.
NovvNmGAmslmtx (NOSSTH).-The retirement of Lord Henry Bentinck, brother to the present Duke of Portland, and the appearance of Mr. J. E. Denison, Lord H. Bentinuk's brother-in-law. bave already been announced. His address, dated from Blythe, Nottinghamshire, on the 24th inst., is the first formal intimation which has been given of the noble Lord's intention to resign, and his motives for adopting that course. His Lordship says:-
"Having oea,ed to be a r2eident in the county, holding no Personal stake within it, and no longer in any manner whatever representing the family interest, itappeasedto me that I suotnowthe fittig inatrument to defend the Conservative interests in the divislon; that It would be moraly wrong to place a lare majority of my most zealous upDpocters in a fale position with their landlord ; and that, under the crCumsteances, It would be proper that my scotituentis should allow me to retire."
PREsRTON.-Every day brings increasing signs that the contest here will be one of the most severe that ever took place in this borough. Although it is termed a ldry" election, the public feeling is being graduafiy worked up. It had been rumoured that Sir Georgo Strlckland would rutire, and leave hlr. Grenferi and Mr. Cross to walk over; but Sir George refuted this rumour on Tuesday evening at a crowded meeting of the electors, whenl he addressed them at some length. At the conclusion of his address the following resolution was agreed to:-
"That, in the opinion of this meeting, Sir George Strickland h entitled to the continued onfidence and sapport of the Liberal electors of Preston; ard this meeting pledges itelf to promote his se-deletion."
There was a meeting of Mr. Cross's [friends on the same evening.
SALvOo n.-Sir E. Armitage addressed a meeting on Tuesday evening. He said Mr. Cobden had kindly recommended him, but he denied that he was the mere nominee of any party, and he would always gve his votes fearlessly and to the best of his judgment. IFe was in favour of household suffrage; he regarded the ballotas essential; he should have voted for Mr. L. King's motion; lhe was opposed to churchrates; he was in favour of the voluntary principle in education and of the present Factory Act, and he considered it unfair to abolish the Maynooth grant, unless all the religious endowments in Ireland were removed at the same time. He thoughtit was never intended that one constituency of 100,000 should be represented by one member, while another of the same number should send 10 or 12. MIr. W. N. Massey has ad. dressed several large and enthusiastic meetings of his supporters. At one of them he declared that he would not maintain his connexion with any i3nister who would attempt a retrogradeecourse. If the present Administration were dissol ved the onl available materials for another were thoes which had accidentally met M&r. Cobden. ir. Cobden said he would never take office, and his pleasuer was to find fault with every one who did. (Laughter.) An Administration which included Messrs. Gladstone and Disraeli, and that most reCkdess of all public men, Lord Derby (laughter), would not deserve confidence.
SCARBOROUGH.-There are three candidates in the field at p resent-the Earl of Ilugrave and Sir J. Johnstone (the old members, and Dr. Bayford, of London. A fourth candidate, Mr. Thomas Moore, is spoken of.
SHr.OPSaEiB (NORTH).-Mr. Ormsby Gore having retired from the representation, in consequence of continued indis-
tion, the Hon. R.C. HIi, eldest son of ViscountHill, h5s
mduced to come forward, in compliance with a retulsition very numerously and influentially signed. In-hi. address to the electors he says:-
"Iudividually I could not have expected such a mark of your confidence; perwouialy unknown to most of you, I must attribate it to the estimation In wbich you hold those Drinciples which have for generations been advocated by members of my famlay. These I hasI endeavour to mauitain; and should I be elected as your repre setative you will, I trnt, find me unremitting tn my attention to the buiess of the county, an enemy to all abuses both at home and snroad, a fin ,supporter of our Queen and Constitution, and a sincerel and unflinching advocate of the pure doctrines of the Protestant faith."
There wiiU be no opposition to his return.
STnocJD.-Sir Thomas Herbert retired from the contest on Saturday last, the reason alleged in his parting address being that he found a great many sectional differences among the Conservative party. On Tuesday Mr. Bengough gave way, notwithstanding that he had expressed his determination to go to the poll at a meeting held on Saturday. In his farcwell address he states that he received a letter froa Lord John RusseU deprecating an attempt to divide the Liberal interest, and he thelefore retires in deference to the oinion of his Lordship, whose leadership he would, he sals, ave been proud to acknowledge. The nomination is fixed for Friday next, when the present members will walk over the course, though there have been six candidates before the electors in the course of the canvass.
TAUNTow.-Mr. Campbell has declared his intention of going to a poll, and professes to have encouraging prospects of success.
WAxxFr.-3Mr. Charleswortb, the Conservative candidate, will be unopposed. Mr. Somerset Beaumont, we understand, addressed with great effect a private meeting of the Liberal electors, who passed a resolution approving his ;olitical sentiments, but recommending him not to embark in a contest, on account of the advanced state of the Conservative cmvass in the borough.
WALLI oyoFD-r. Morrel has issued an address to the electors, in which he declines to contest the borough. He says-
My long personal friendship with Tery many of you, adea to the intimacy and oonnelion of my ancetors with Ious,, would have iAslded me in accepting your proposal. but other consideratIoan determine me to deny myvelt the di3tinctin which now awatt your sufErage
"While then, you will excuse meifrom accefing to your reauegt, I tust itwillnot beireleTant to remark that, had it been consbtent with my engagements to embark in the sea of politim, the chart by which Ishould have sailed wealdhave been penciled by no paty, nor the course have veered with ay section c the Hous of Commons bltthstIshouldhavehonaty steered solely topropel my oountry's cause, our nation's welfare. and your loca intereste.
WOLVERHAsTOl.-blr. Kettle, who has been prose. cuting an active canvass in this town, has wisely retired, having met with very little encouragement from the electors. The Right Hon. C. P. Viliiers andgr. Thornely wMi therefore be returned without opposition.
YOBIL-The now candidate for this city, announced in our impression of yesterday as Mr. Malcolm, is Mr. Malcolm Lewin.
SCOTLAND.
APGYLT.osrnE-Sir A. L Campbell declines again to offer himself for this county. It is understood thattthe Duke of Argyll and the Marquis of Breadalbane are favourably inclined towards Mr. Finlay, of Castletoward, the new candidateo This, coupled with the large amountof votes
now in the hands of the Glasgow merchants, through tele't country houses on the Argyilshire coast, and the great majority of wbom are Liberals, would have rendered Sir Archibald's chances hopeless. By this election one vote will be lost by the Conservative and gained by the Liberal interest.
Buzssgrx. - The Right Hon. Stuart Wortley has transmitted the following address to the electors of the county of Bute : -
"Yoaaleal, Ibehlee,vawarethts aever attack of Sllnesbsup to this time made it SmpoSbla ror me to take any tep n eead to

The sheriff has fixed Monday, the 30th inst., for the nomination for this county, when 1r. Wotley will be cordially returned in his absence.

The enthusisasmwhich welcomed the reopening of Her Majesty's Theatre was not confined to the asuberiberA. The heartylntoreot and genuine as-preciation displaLyed hy the audiences who thronged tbehe ouse rai the first nitht to the closing rerwell demand the warrnct thankts of the Director, which he will endeavour

Theos advantages wil be turned to account by a compay combining the preetige of askuawledged genius with toe attraction of noew candidates far the highest rank of their profoaslon. Those who lent earwon favour at the hand, of strangers w35 reappear to clam the cordial reegnition which an English aussence 2never refuses to established farourites; and the diretion baa been fartoonr strengthened by an accession of new aspirants of the highest order. whiose merits are a1reedy acknowledged on the singee of Italy, and wrhoaoul wait the verdict of the subscribers enid frtequenters oftHer htajreti'sTheatre to oonbLm their tame.

London, Thursday, March 26, 1857.
LONDON, THUBSDAY, MARCH 26, 1857.
By a coincidence of occaaions the two great Anglo-Saxon communities of the world will in the space of a single month have laid the foundations of new Governments for their respective countries. In America these alternations of policy proceed according to fixed laws, and with the regularity of a machine. After four years of office the President and Adlministration of the United States are absolved from their duties on the 4th of March, and as the clock strikes 12 on that day the existing Governmnent gives place to another. In England the course of affairs is different. The Usher of the Black Rod can, indeed, convey to our legislative body in a few brief words the tidings that dispersion awaits theem, but the event, except that it must occur cnce in seven years, is not assigned to any fixed season or period. It is accident alone which on -this occasion has brought the constitutional solemnities of the two countries into signal and striking ,contrast, nor do we think that, upon temperate reflection, a comparison of the rival institutions -will leave us much to repine at on this side of the Atlantic.
The American Congress, according to pure Democratic theory, may certainly appear to be more absolutely a creation of the people than the British House of Commons, for the numbers of a constituency determine the numbers of its represontative3, votes are taken by ballot, and members are paid. We do not pretend, indeed, to doubt that Congress .does give an effective representation of American opinion, but Congress is not the only power in the State established by popular election. The Presidezl, himself, $he head of the Administration, is also Aapjnted in the polling-booths of the country, and we have recently witnessed the thoroughly electioueering character of which this mighty -contest partakes. The President of the United States doep beyond all question personify the choice of the people, but the suiffrages are given -without power of revocation, and they commit the great constituency of the Union for four years -together, on many most important points, to the guidance and policy of a single man. An Ainerican Administration cannot, except by a solemn and Iexpress renewal of public confidence, last longer than four years; but four years, as regards is controlling authority, it must last, whatevor
may be its mistakes, its incompetence, or its perversity; nor is any opportunity afforded to the public of reconsidering its resolution. There is no " appeal to the country," no consultation of "the " constituencies," no " want of confidence vote" Practicable. At the appointed period, indeed, the constitutional fabric will be submitted to the people for reconstruction, but until that hour arrives the electoral decision cannot be rescinded. President PIERCE might, if he had so pleased, have disturbed or destroyed the relations of the Union with any State in the universe, against all the opinions of his constituents, but until the 4th of this month his authority could not be impeached nor his policy effectually controlled. The attributes and power of this great appointment are derived, it is true, in the first instance, from the voice of the whole community, but when the community has spoken the word the vow is irrevocable, and for a certain term of years the President aud the people are indissolubly joined together.
With these institutions compare our own. The office of P .ne Minister depends virtually upon the votes of Parliament, nor could it be retained without the confidence of the House of Commons; but from this House of Commons there lies at any time an appeal to the constituencies, and Lord PALIERSTON is at this moment challenging the judgment of the country as completely as Mr. BucnANw did last autumn. If the verdict of the constituencies proves to be such as there is every reason to anticipate, his Lordship, as the First Minister of the CRowi, will represent the decision of the electors with as much faithfulness as the American President. Here, bowever, the resemblance ends, and the contrast-as we think to the advantage of England-will be found to begin. Not only do our institutions provide other powers to ballast and trim the vessel of the State when careering under the impulse of popular will, but this will itself is open at all times to correction or revocation. Not only can the House of Commons be reconstituted, but, even without reconstitution, and while composed of the same elements, it can withdraw at brief notice that confidence on which the Administration relies. It is under no necessity of waiting for a fixed period, or of enduring the miseries of an ill-starred union till the appointed hour of divorce and release. A vote of censure or want of confidence can be moved by any member in the House, and, if carried, will subvert the Government. Such a creature as a " despotic" Minister exists, as far as this countrY is concerned, only in the imagination of Mr. CosnmD. Applied to American institutions, the phrase might, indeed, be more justifiable, for there the country stands inextricably to its first vote; but in England the offices of Government are always held only during pleasure. The very Parliament which Lord PALXnaTON will have to meet, however his popularity might have influenced the elections, could abandon him as soon as it was formed ; and, if there were goodc reason for the proceeding, the opinion of the country would support it. The approbation justly yielded to the Prermier's past services gives him no kind of impunity or irresponsibility for the future. His security does not extend to his forthcoming policy, except in so far as that policy sball continue to receive public approval. The country will not be tied or bound to him in any way whatever. Hle cannot commit us to any unpopular or unpatriotic course. If, instead of despatching such reinforcements to China as will place our countrymen beyond risk of harm, and establish our relations with the Chinese on a safe and acceptable footing, he were to adopt the alternative he has himself described, and surrender the honour of England to those truculent barbarians, Parliament would promptly terminate his Administration without waiting for the 4th of blarob, 1861. The country is answering the appeal of the Government, not as exempting that Government from future accountability, or as voting it a definite lease of power, but simply as acknowledging service rendered, and accepting it as a pledge for more. We can only augur the future from the past. Lord PALMERSTONi and his colleagues have earned the approval of the country by what they have done, and it is not only in the hope, but, what is far more important, on the notorious condition, that their policy shall continue to be satisfactory, that the suffrages of the constituencies, as we confidently expect, will confirm them in power.
We cannot but consider that in the balance of these institutions the scale of British freedom preponderates, and we believe, indeed, notwithstanding the demonstrations to the contrary which might be offered on paper, that we are inthe enjoyment of a mnuch more genuine political liberty than our Transatlantic kinsmen. They stand now committed, as regards their foreign policy, to Mr. BUCHATAN-a man of high abilities, no doubt, and unquestionably the President of their own free choice; but, though they chose him, they must also keep him, whereas no electoral judgment, however strongly pronounced, will commit us to Lord PALIEsRSTON any further than as regards the approval of his past acts. If his foreign policy should become pusillanimous or perilous, weak or wanton, " tur" bulent" or " aggressive," in the eyes of the Legislature, he will lose at once the support on which he leans, and the impending verdict of the constituencies wiU not avail him one jot. If he should point, under such circumstances, to the suffrages this week recorded in favour of his policy, he would be promptly told that the favour in question, to be worth anything, must be continuous, and that, whatever willingness to support him might have been entertained by a Parliament at its first assembling, the confidence of that body could only be retained by the same merits which acquired it. Lord PALMERSTON and his colleagues have, in our opinion, deserved the approbation of the constituencies, and we believe they will obtain it, but they will not be taken for better or worse for four years to come.
"Who ever heard of such a thing as a man's
Or
" Who ever heard of such a thing as a man's " virtue ?" says Lady BooBY, in FLnmDIG'S novel. Really, when we read the loud-mouthed proclamations of their own spotless integrity which the BrvrusEs and Qmsisuss of Parliamentary life are in the habit of dealing forth to their admirers just now-in electioneering times-we cannot help thin-ing of her Ladyship. The most notorious JosErn: A?NDRiws of the time is perhaps Air. W. WILLIAMES, the ex-Member for Lambeth. The efforts which this gentleman has made to maintain his virtue amid manifold temptations are really incredible. Invitations to Royal balls, invitations to aristocratic assemblies, the blandishments of beauty, and the cajoleries of coxcombs, leave him as they find him-patriotic, calm, stern, but yet lovely in his strength "as is the light of a dark " eye in woman." A dead set has been made at the honourable gentleman, as we learn from the speech which he addresed to the electors of Lanibeth on Tuesday last. The QuEEN has been quite " put out" that Mr. W. WILIuAm would not countenance her little parties at the Palace. The mysterious coteries in the backParlour of Cheshain-place have been imperfect because he was not there. Many a Duchess would have asked no better than to have the company of Mr. W. WILLMas in a tea-green brougham. The man might soften, indeed, but the b.P. was resolwd. When he thought of the Fxtension of the &E=tOge ho spasid the flowery chains vwhich tiie hands of ar3p6cesatic beautgl had woven for hSiimady limb3.. 'lbhiaim the Ballot was morq th&ai thRa liuest eZeg The cry ohiVh=g1y COD,-
stituents for Electoral Districts stoppe, his ears against the soft meretricious swell of the venal music which timed the unpatriotic quiverings of the marble limbs of MIayfair. Well, after all, it is something to find a CncimrgTus or an Ak;mgew MARVELI in these days of jobbery, and Royal British Banks, and general bribery and corruption. We have him, however, in the person of Mr. W. Wuzs. The thirst of DiooENsEs's ghost is slaked at last. We learn, from his own lips at least, that he has resisted aU corruption, all temptation-of intimidation we speak not, for clearly BonxAs would have no chance against the ex-Member for Lambeth. Everything that can flatter the imagination, gratify the senses, or pander to the passions of a human being has been offered to this upright man, and offered in vain. It may be true that with advancing years his more vulgar and ordinary appetencies may haye been gratified ana palled; but, surely, in most of us ambition survives. Now, Mr. W. WILuais tells us that when the rulers of the British Empire found him impervious to temptation in every other form they touched this string, and with no undexterous hand. What we are about to relate actually occurred to Mr. W. WrLms in the course of his Parliamentary career. A whipper-in, a gentleman who had the dispensation of 20,000 places, buttonholed him upon one occasion, and addressed the worthy M.P. in the following terms:-" What " a misfortune it is you are always so cross with "us, we don't care about the Tory party de"fnouncing us, but it is most unpleasant to see " you, a Liberal, and a supporter of Government "in a great number of instances, finding fault "with us, and exposing us in all sorts of ways. "You don't want a place or money, but I should "like very much to make friends with you. What "would be agreeable to you? Would you like "honours-atitle ?" PositivelyourfriendWiLLAx Wi.uiAs of Lambeth-the Wumurs-adapted as he is by nature to grace any station, has refused a Peerage for his country's good I We are curious to know the exact title which was offered to him. Did Mr. W. Wnr.iars notice the exact condition of the whipper-in's cheek at the time this offer was made ? Might not that functionary's left eye have been noticed by any more acute observer to have assumed at the time an abnormal appearance I Finally, at what hour was the offer named ?-was it inter pocula, or otherwise?
It was Mr. ROEBuCK who first sounded the pitch-pipe which has set all our ultra-patriots a-droning upon this dismal tune. Now, we write as men who have some little pretension to be informed upon the matter, and as persons who heartily wish well to the popular cause; but we verily beEeve that a more extravagant absurdity was never uttered than is conveyed in this cry of corruption by aristocratic influence. If the clamour were founded upon fact the rogues should be dismissed with all convenient despatch to their estates, their railways, their chambers in Pump-court, and their counting-houses. We write especially for our friends in the provinces, for the more ardent politicians in the Mechanics' Institutes, and otber excellent and intelligent persons similarly situated. Before abounding in the sense of Messs. ROEBUCK; and WmzLi&ss, let them quietly take down the Parliamentary Companion. for the last Parliament, and divide off the various members under various heads. They will find first a very large section of the 650 and odd members who are connected by birth and position with the aristocratic class. These worthy persons naturally hang by their own people. Then come the county members-mest excelent, but some,what dreary individuals, who interchange county dinners with each other in London. To be sure, they might be somewhat affronted if they did not receive from the Palace the regulation number of invitations for Royal balls, &c., to which, as they presume, they are entitled by their position. They might assume somewhat of austerity in their aspect if the Ministers on their own side did not invoke their presence at the usual number of Ministerial soir&es. But, Royal balls or Ministerial dinners to the contrary notwithstanding, they would vote with their party to the world's end. Take the militarymembers, ex offcio heroes of society. Take the railway jobbers, who enter Parliament for heavy jobbery connected with their lines, and who are not likely men to mistake trifle for solid beef and pudding. Take the expectant lawyers, some few of whom are aiming at the higher places of the law, but of whom by far the greater portion would willingly give themselves up to theoretical patriotism upon far easier terms; and are they such a simple-minded race that the blandishments of society could be brought to bear upon them with any serious effect ? All due deductions made for the real virtue, for the position, and probable petty ambitions and selfish objects of the great majority of the members, we do not think we are guilty of exaggeration when we say that six hundred members, or thereabouts, are reaUy quite unaffected by the class of temptation about which our more earnest politicians have recently been making so considerable a pother.
Now, of the remaining half-hundred, or thereabouts, it is scarcely too much to say that, except in s0 far as they may count for votes upon a division, at least forty are quite insignificant persons. There were not above 20 persons of much note in the last Parliament-we mean men who by their eloquence and by their intelligence could influence a debate. Of these 20 persons how many were there who would not as a matter of course, and quito independently of any line they might have taken in politics, have received these fascinating invitations ? Shall we say fivethree-two ? Let the President of the sternest lRadical Assembly in the country seriously consider with himself whether, had he been Prime MIinister of these realms, he would have thought it worth his while to drag his own name and his wife's name through the mud in order to secure the adhesion of any one of this select band of patriots? WN'here, in our day, is the PmT ?- where is the terrible Commoner? Where is the MIRABEAU, the profligate, but glorious, young noble-the CATim-x of eloquer?ce, whose support -would have been worth purc:iasing at the price of self-degradation ? Our own belief in the matter is
that any hitherto unknown man who makes a considerable figure in the House of Commons will naturally find himself the object of social consideration, and will be invited to the houses of the more considerable people in London, perhaps to a somewhat greater degree than a distinguished literary or scientific man, because his hosts are themselves intent upon political discussion. That
the Queen of GREAT BRITAIN, or that Lord PAB-
=1BoX?r, or Lord Dls)x s is in such matters the slave of the division list, or that our needy patriots are assailed with aristocratic blandishments, or that Ir. W. WmIA,ls has been offered a title and has rejected it, we do not for a moment believe. He and men like him sit and dream of such things, as young ladies of forty see a Don J-uAr in every muffin-boy who passes along Obeliskcrescent about half-past 4 on an evening of November.
Like all the other great people, Lord MALMES-
LiLe all tTle other great people, Lord, MAI&mSnuRy publishes a baxife.to; and, now that Parliaxment is no more, a his Lordship has no borough to stand for, and has not. been asked to the Mansion-heo,, het is driven to the numu-at Lcourse of. xzlying, to Lord PALonsiox through
the pres6. IordMAL3MnsnuJY, however, we are sorry to say, has eontributed nothing to the dignity of the channel through which he has condeswended to instruct mankind. His speech upon Lord DERBY'S motion was a tissue of the grossest abuse of Sir *JoN BowRtuio, in which he did not confine himself to the affair of the lorcha, or to what folloved from it, but went back into various old matters that occurred to his Lordship's recoUeetion. So now, with great decency, he takes the judicial view of the question. Sir JoN was on his trial; the blue-book was the " in" dictment ;" Parliament was the jury; and the " verdict" it gave on the " evidence" was unfavourable to the " defendant." His Lordship having thus performed at once the offices of prosecutor, advocate, judge, jury, and everything but exeoutioner upon the defendant, and having superadded a liberty of judicial speech commonly supposed to have gone out with Judge JXFrFarys, and having ransacked the past and the future for materials against the accused, calls Lord PAL?ERSTON to account for giving the electors of Tiverton a short and eomprehensive narrative of the Chinese part in the affair. In fact, Lord PAn sTox N in that address did what was perfectly simple and fair, and could deceive nobody. He described the progress of the Chinese from one atrocity to another, and then added a comprehensive account of our proceedings. Every reader could understand that, the Chinese having begun the gane, we took it step by step, leaving the Chineso in possession of the ball at the date of the last news. Nobody would understand Lord PAL"sVzsTor to mean that the Cbinese had their innings first, from the Arrow down to the arsenic, and that when their last man, Awmr, had been bowled out we only then began our innings. Lord PALxERSTOI stated the whole case beeause the whole case was before Parliament, and they had before them the indisputable proofs of YEi'S utter barbarism,-no slight element in the affair. If the " original dispute of " the Arrow" was all Parliament had to do with, why import the whole history into the debate t Why expatiate, as Lord MALINESBUrY did, on Sir JOnir BoVWIXG'S vanity, monomaniat arrogance, and all the rest of it ?
Lord MALMESBURY backs his international law and also his views of international honour against Lord PAnxrnsToN's, with the result that might have been anticipated. He says that reprisals are never taken without a declaration of war; which is simply not the case, for they often are, and must be. He then says that Sir J. BOWn.EG had obtained or secured " important compensation." The phrase strikesusas rather newin diplomacy-indeed, anywhere. Though so mysteriously big and ingeniously grave, it means nothing. " Compensation" in matters of honour cannot be described in advertising slang. If you knocked a man down, and then stuffed a sovereign into his waistcoat pocket, it might be an important " compensation" if the man was a drunken costermonger who had trod on your toes, but it would not be "im" portant " if the man was your equal, or if you had done much more than knock him down. To take a nearer illustration,-if you seized a man's purse on the allegation that it contained stolen money, Lord MAnrsuiy would hardly call it " important compensation" if you undertook never to take his purse again, and, so saying, flimg it back in his face. This was pretty much what Yxa did, and what our people very properly declined to consider " an important compensation." The truth is, Yzn refused to retrace his steps; he would not confess an error. He would not go through, with respect to the Arrow, that very formality which he admitted to be due under the Treaty, and which he promised, after a. fashion, to observe for the future. In other words, he would not make the compensation that hit the case.
When Lord PAMmRSTOW charges certain persons with endeavouring to make the humiliation and degradation of the country the stepping-stone to office, we can only be astonished that anybody should have the folly to doubt it, or the audacity to deny it. Should the country confirm the decision of the House of Commons, would not these men step to power by a process of national humiliation acnd degradation ? In what sense ean it possibly be disputed? Lord MALTmSBURY, too, admits what everbody knows, that the very persons who have tried to stamp crime and infamy on the face of their country are fully prepared to proceed with the crime and swalow the infamy. The country having been committed, he says his humble vote will support a war which has become necessary to English interests and honour. Such is the conclusion of his Lordship's letter. After alleging that Lord PALMEESTON was bound to repucliate the proceedings of HER MAJSTY'S servants at Canton at any cost of British interests and honour, he now, ~without any material change in the circumstances, avows that he will further prosecute, for the sake of British interests, a war which he has declared to be impolitic, and for the sake of British honour a war which he has declared to be utterly causeless, and the result of British arrogance, vanity, violence, falsehood, and fraud.
The appendix to the "Ninth General Report
The appendix to the "Ninth General Report "of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for Eug"land, " which has juat been published, contains a memorandum on a very important subject-viz., the mode in which the " Common " Fund" should be applied to the wants of the Church. The Cathedral Act of 1840 created what is ealled the " Common Fund,"-i.e., a fund consisting of annual income derived from various estates, which had up to that time supported certain Canons, Prebendaries, and other dignitaries, but which, by the extinction of those places, became available for the augmentation of poor livings. This fund came in at its very outset for an income of 10,0001. a-year, which by the falling in of fresh estates has grown till, with the addition of the interest on 400,0001. gained by the sale of Church lands to the lessees under the provisions of a recent Act, it now produces more than 100,0001. a-year. This sum is, with the exception of 18,0001. interest upon the loan from QueenjAwNgs Bounty, contracted under Sir ROBERT PEE's Act, given away in the shape of perpetual annuities to poor livings, new district churches, &C.
But now comes the question which the memorandum we have mentioned raises. This fund has not yet attained nearly its maxiniun, but is annually growing-just now by the sale of Church lands referred to, but mainly by the falling in of new estates-a source of growth which -will last a long time to come. How, then, is this addition to the fund as it comes in to be given away? We naturally say, "Go on as you have done, and charge " your additional annual income with perpetual " annuagrantgs. What better way is there ?" But the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, having gone upon this principle up to the present moment, seem now struck with a sudden panic for the solvency of their fund, and propose another, and, as they think, a safer course.
There is another mode of applying annual income to the augmentation of poor livings, and that is by "distributing it in capital sums, the interest of "sueh sums alone forming the increase in the "ineome of the benefices augmented." This is the mode which has. been adopted by the Governors of Quteen ANxxes 3bunty, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioner propoa to adopt this plaLu in the flture admaijstratiom of the common fund-i. e., the " av ii by capitalJ ums," a they call
it, in diseiilon to the "augmentation by per"petual annuities."
NoIw, a common reader would not ee at first tight the enormous difference there is between these plans in respect of expedition-i. c., the time wvhich they respectively require, and the comparative speed with which they bring the fund to bear upon the wants and necessities of the Church ; but a very simple sum will show him. Let us suppo3e 10,0001. a-year to be applied to the augmentation of poor livings. If we give away this sum at once in the shape of perpetual annuities, we have instantly two hundred poor livings enjoying each an addition of 50. a-year; that is to say, the whole strength of the fund is made to tell immediately, and to impart from the very first the fullest relief which it is capable of giving. But adopt the other plan,i.e., treat this 10,0001. a-year as capital, of which the interest is to go for the purpose of augmentation, and you get the first year one " capital sum" of 10,0001., the interest of which, at 3 per cent., augments six poor livings 501. a-year each; 'the next year you get another capital sum, and augment another six poor livings; the next year another, and you augment another six; and so on, till at the end of more than 30 years you have at last two hundred poor livings receiving each their 501. annual augmentation. In more than 30 years you gradnally do by one plan what you -would by the other plan have been doing all the time.
This is an enormous present loss, and what is the compensation for it ? The compensation is, that at the end of this period the Church, having treated all these successive sums as capital, of which she only spent the interest, has at last by accumulation a new " stock," which does the work of augmentation without the aid of the original fund,-in short, that she is richer by so many hundred thousands. Well, this is a great gain for the Church 30 or 40 years hence; but the question is whether we are called upon so far to sacrifice the interests of the present Church for the sake of those of the future. This new stock will, in fact, have been gained simply by the Church not spending her present income. Here is so much income, which naturally comes in every year from the legitimate capital of the Church-tbat is to say, from landed estates, together with money in the funds, got by the sale of land, the joint source of the income of the "Common Fund." This being so much natural annual income from the capital of the Church, why in the world may not the Church annually spend it ? Is it unjust or is it unsafe simply to spend our proper income? It would, undoubtedly, be ruinous and dishonest to be spending the Church's capital, but it is perfectly fair to spend the interest of it, and the whole of the interest. The plan of forming theincomeof the Common Fund, as it comes in, into " capital sums," is simply to abstain from using that income, to lay it by, to hoard it. But honest guardianship is one thing, and hoarding is another. We should not be spending our capital, but, when we have capital which produces certain interest, voluntarily to turn that interest into capital again is, if not parsimony, at least greater forbearance that can be fairly expected from the present generation. But this is the plan which the Ecclesiastical Commissioners now recommend. We are, with all the crying wants of the present Church, to be saving for the future, and not to spend our present income.
The Ecclesiastical Commisioners, indeed, hardly appear, from tho argument of this memoraudum, to see the great sacrifice they are demanding from the presenpt Church. They just admit that their plan " is less speedy in operation ," it would be truer to say that it keeps a whole generation out of the enjoyment of its legitimate rights. They argue, too, as if there were no present capital, and they were going to make one for the first time; they appeal simply to the general argument for the utility of a fund, and tell us that if we accept their plan, " there will be a ftund which may annually "be completely exhausted, with theassurance that " the next succeeding year will, so long as time "shall last, yield a further amount." That is all very true, and " funds" and " stock" and " capital" are very good things. But they forget that we have already a "fund," a " stock," and " capitar' in the estates aud funded property which form the basis of the " Common Fund," and that what they, the Commissioners, are going to do is forming another fund, another stock, another capital, and forming it out of the interest of the existing capital. But that is another business altogether. The Church is in great, urgent, and real want now, and it cannot be right to pass over present want. Let us relieve it by al the fair means we have, and leave the Church of 30 or 40 years hence to look after itself.
Will the Commissioners say that the fluctuating nature of the income of the " Common Fund," and the various oblique claims upon it, make it unsafe to spend the whole of the annual income, and that " a very wide margin must be preserved to " cover" these liabilities ? The reply is, let them leave a margin, and as viide a one as they thinlk will be necessary. It may be quite true, as they say, that "a difference of opinion wiU always " exist as to the extent of the margin," but it does not at all follow therefore that by a decent exercise of judgment the limits of the margin may not be defined tolerably well. What are these gentlemen in office for, and two of them, if we mistake not, handsomely paid for it, if they do not give the country and the Church the use of their judgment on such a question ? But this is generally, sooner or later, the way with permanent Commissions, especially those concerned with the Church's affairs. Their object is to get things into a jog-trot pace, and create a sort of selfacting system, which does not require trouble or skilL This is the tendency of the new plan of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, by which the income of the " Common Fund" is to capitalize itself year by year for the advantage of posterity.

WhitebaU Gardens, March 25.
" London, MArch 25,
"My Lord;-I am one of those who thought it their duty to vote against-your Government upon the China question, and who have in consequenoe been exposed to your public invectives and misrepresentations on the aubject. Yom bave uttered and written these at a moment when we are unable to reply to them in Parliament, and I therefore adopt the less usual course of answering you through the press
"The invective is of comparatively little consequence
but it is important that the public, who are now occupied with the primary causes and proceedingsof the Chinese war, and who have never read the blue-book exoept in extract4, should know exactly what they were. That blue-book wag Sir John Bowring's justification of his atts.
" It became our indictment against him, and the House of Commons upon its evidence gave a verdict against the defendant.
" Now, tbat verdict was founded upon what appeared irt the blue-book as having occurred up to the time it was produced, and when the events were related according to their respective dates. Bat this undoubted evidence lives in direct contradiction to the statement which you raake to your constituents at Tiverton.
"To them you write-
I An insolent barbarian wielding authority at Canton had violated the British flag, broken the engagements of treaties, offered rewards for the heads of Bntish subjects in that part of China, and planned their destruetion by murder, assassinations, and poisons. The British officers, cvil and naval, on the station had taken those measures which appeared to them to be proper and necessary toy obtain redress.'
" Now, my Lord, the inference which must be dravw from these lines is that all those outrages preceded our seizures of the ships, sheling forts, and bombarding Canton itself, and Were the provocations to our aggression. This inference is not true, for, with the exception of the first onr
-namely, the supposed violation of the British flag on board the Arroow, all the others were subsequent to and in retaliation for our operations conducted without any declaration of war.
"You would make your constituents believe that the issue upon which the minority in the Lords and the majority in the Comumons decided was that all the outrages which you enumerate could not and did not justify our hostilities, whereas they only declared that the original dispute of the Arrow did not justify the violence of our measures-measures which had subsequeutly induced barbArous reprisals and engaged us in a sanguinary war. That was the real issue and verdict before Parliament; but you have, both in your address and in your speech at the Mansion-house, attenpted to mislead the public as to this fact by mixing up the successive events and confusing the impressions of your audience. If the bluebook were within their reach, they would find that Sir John Bowring did obtain or secure important comnpensation for the first offence, and might then have stayed his hand until he received orders from home, but that the bloodshed and orimes that have followed are the consequence of other demands which you yourself in your wiser hours had officially pronounced to be dangerous and unprofitable.
" You proceed to tell the voters of Tiverton that we are men 'who have endeavoured to make the humiliation andL degradation of our country the stepping stone to power.' What opinion, my Lord, have you of the memory and credulity of your countrymen if you think they have forgottez that Lord John Russell has but lately retired from your owu Cabinet, and that Lord Derby, having resigned office on the first hostile division of the House of Commons in 1852, haa supported yourself and your colleagues with all the strengtba of the Conservative party during every phase of the Russian war ?
" Such statements may, perhaps, be forgiven in ant addres as an electioneering claptrap; but was it decent to, use the table at the Mansion-house as a hustings? For I find that at the Lord's Mayor's dinner on the 20th inst. you are reported by 17Te Tims to have spoken thus -' If those who voted against us had risen to power, what ought they to have done as the logical and inevitable consequence ot their vote? They asserted that our proceedings were unjustifiable. . . . They must have paid the rewards which had been given for the heads of our merchants, and the cost of the araenic which had been used in poisoning our felow-subjects at Hongkong.'
And thig is the language of the Prime Minister of England at the banquet of the first magistrate of her capital, surrounded by foreigu ambassadors and all the talentk rank and wealth of his party. What they thought of this extra. ordinary insult to some 400 members of Parliament is easily guessed and known; but what would the most ignorant of our countrymen have said of your logic had you addressed themthus in an analogous case of possible occurrence? 'Two men quarrel, and proceedfrom words to blows; one is kiled. The survivor is tried, his counsel pleads jastifiable homicdo, the jury give a verdict of manslaughter. Pending the: trial the relations of the deceased take up the feud, andL poison those of the accused. The jury, logically, must par for the poison.'
"H 8ave I not, tben, a right to call your Lordship's speech in the city an electioneering claptrap? Bet was it the place and the audience for such a tone? The impatienco of obsourity or the irritation of misfortunie may sotmetimes excuse invective, but you had on that occasion no such plliation. You are the popular Minister of the day. Yox may justly refer your countrymen to very long and, I admit. veryusefel services to the State. They appearto be anxiousto. do you honour and give you their confidence, and yet you choose this moment of pride and prosperity wiantonly to accuse those who have, like myself, often supported you in maintaining the honour of England and defending her best institutions of sacrificing these to the basest personal motives.
"If the charge had not proceeded fromnso high a quarter I should have despised it. I declare it to bo utterly unfounded as regards myself, andI believe it to be equally s
as regards the gentlemen with whom I found myself in unusual accordance upon the China vote. By its very nature it was unconnected with any party creeds as to reUlgion, finance, or politics, and this is the simple and true explanation of the medleey division that ensued.
" The country having been committed, my humrble vote will support a war which has now become necessary to English interestsand honour, but which at first might have beem avoided witbout a sacrifice of either.
"I have the hoiLour to remain,
"Your Lordship's obediont servant,

The Golden-Lane Schools.
THE GOLDEN-LANE SCHOOLS.
A. festival was held yesterday at the Albion Tavernm. Aldersgate-street, to celebrate the opening of the schools inx Golden-lane, which took place on Thursday last, under the august patronage of his Boyal Highness IPrince Albert. The Fight Hon. Lord John Russell presided on the occasion, his Lordship being supported by many of the friends and patrons of the Ragged School Associatiosl. After partaking of a very excellent dinner, the noble Lord calledon the meeting to give their ntost strenuous assistance to promote the institution of these echools, which he considered were ,cstined to become an example to the whole country. When contemplating the condition of the people of this vast city there was one thing which particularly struck him. which was that, while they had almost ceased to wonder a*t the improvements in mechanical scienco nd in artistic in. ventions that had taken place, and bad also assumed, as an, ordinary thing, the diffusion of politicalknovwledgo throughout the land, there existed, contemporaneously with, al} these scientific advancements, a mno0L and religious atte of feeling on the part of the population which showed. a most lamentable deficiency in even the elementary principles o %. religious and saoral system of instrm:tzon.

r4k'At, MA1^CH 24, 6 .ar.
I mentioned some time since that differences had arisenbetweenthe representatives of the two branohes of the Bourbons about the non-recognition of the tricoloured flag by the Count de Chambord. In the month of August last a letter was addressed by the Duke de Nemoura to one of the leading members of the Fugionist party in Paris, in whieh he lnnounced 'that, as an understanding could not be come to, the Princes of Orleans considered themselves as released from every obligation they might have contracted. The Fusionist leader kept the contents of the letter to himself till the month of November last, when he communicated them to a well-known Leitimist, and requested him to bring them to the kOovwle( e of the Count de Chambord. Two sentences only were extracted and sent to the head of the house of Bourbon. The Count was hurt at a communication being made to him in such a form; he replied that he regarded it as nwnm avenue, and that he ehould still consider that matters remained unchanged. In the meantime occurred the death of M. de Salvandy, which gave occasion for the letter of the Count de Chambord to M. Pageot, in which, it may be remembered, the assurance was repeated of the political reconciliation remaining established between the elder and youngerbranches of the Bourbon family. The Orleanists were thrown into great confusionat the protest of the Duke de Nemours, and they insisted that a categorical explanation should be demanded. The Duke de Nemoura consequently addressed a letter to the Countde Chambord, to which the Count replied. The Duke's letter I am not scquainted with, but a friend has sent me from London a copy of the reply of the Count de Chambord. It is as follows -
" My Cousin,-I have read your lotter with deep regret and sorrow. Iwas pleased to think that we,had under. stood in the same manner the reconciliation effected between us now four years ago. That re-establishment of our political and family relations, while it was gratifying to my heart seemed to my judgment a pledge of salvation for France, and one of the firmest guarantees of her future. In order to justify my hope, in order to render our union at the same time efficacious and worthy, there wero wanting only two things, which yet were very esy-to remain, on your part as on mine, equally convinced of the necesdty of our union, and to maintain a confidence equally solid in our mutual sentimentb. I have not doubted your
devotion to the principle of monarchy; and no one can' caU in question my attachment to France, my respect for her glory, my good wishes for her greatness and her liberty; and my sympathetic gratitude is given to those who have at every period done for her what is good, useful, and great. I have never ceased to think, I have always said, I have always believed, and I stiL believe, in the impropriety of regulating, before the moment comes when Providence shal impose on us that duty, questions which the interests and the wishes of our country shal resolve. It is not while we are far from France, and without France, that people can dispose of her. I do not tho less preserve my profound conviction that it is by the union of our house, and by the common efforts of all the defenders of monarchical institutions, that France will be one day saved; and her saddest trials have not weakened my faith.
" HENLI"
The Fusionists are exceedingly irritated at such corre-spondencebei,ween the families, and the quarrel about a white or a particoloured piece of silk or bunting is something ludicrous, and shows the hollowness of the pretended reconciliation between them. The Princes seem to forget that the bear has first to be caught before one can sell his skin.
A letter from Vienna, of the 22d inst., states that a telegraphic despatch has been received there, announcing that General Count Marziani, who commands the Austrian troops in the Principalities, had made his official visit of leave to the authorities, who proposed to return his visit the following day. General Marziani proposed to quit Bucharest on the 23d, with his entire stafi, to proceed to Giurgevo, and embark there for Austria.

The recall of the Austrian Charg6 d'Affaires from Turin haa been managed in a most undignified way, and the " inspired" leaders in the Ost-Deutsche Post are calculated to excite in the minds of the public a uspicion that the Imperial Cabinet feels it would ha.ve been better policy had it altogether ignored the unseemly language of the Sardinian press. Instead of simply and briefly informing the public that the Austrian Government has ordered Count Paar to quit his poat at Turin and to return to Vienna, the non-official organ tells a long rigmarole story about the care which has been taken " to deprive the measure of any character that could be prejudi-
csaj No thC cause of peace." That Austria has'just taken one of those half-measures for which she is renowned is evident from the following. The Post says :-
"We re informed that Count Faar has neither been instrcted to demand his passports nor to notify to the Sardinian Cabinet that tho diplomatic relations between the two Governments have been broken off The Austrian Charg6 d 'Ares will take leave of Count Cavour in the
way that is sual when a diplomatist is about to undortake a journey. If he is not able positively to say when he shall return it is in onaequence of circumstances over which Count Cavour, and not he, has control. The road to a more friendly policy w ll always be left open by Austria.
Theviolent attacks rade on the Emperor of Austria by the Turin press are greatly to be deplored, but the hostility of Count Cavour and his colleapues to Austria cbnot eocitb thee satonishment of those persons wb ho lle6tthe"tone in which the organs of the Aus* fire,** *6re accuBtomed'to speak of the

As to the Austrian fortress of Piacenza, in the territory of the Duke of Parma, very considerable sums of money have recently been expended in strengthening its workL
On the 16th Count Gyulai, the new Commander of the Second or Austro-Italian Army, went to Venice,where he was receivedby the militaryauthorities with great ceremony. The Field-Marshal paraded that part of the garrison which was not on duty on the Place of St. Mark, and by so doing showed the inhabitants of the city that the garrisoa was a powerful one, and introduced himself to the troops as their commander-in-chief. It is remarked at Venice that the silver zwanziger is beginning to be a rare ooin. A great deal of foreign gold is m circulation, and more particularly French, Piedmontese, and Roman coins. When their Majesties went to Venice several millions of zwanzigers were coined in the " Zeeea" (the Mint at Venice is so called), but not one of them is now to be seen. It seems that they were bought up by the moneychangers, and exported to Sardinia and France, from which countries gold was sent back in exchange.
All the smaller forts and fleldworks which were constructed in Galicia during the war will be demolirhed, as a new system of " fortified positions" is about to be introduced. In the years 1855 and 1856, when the Austrian army was almost face to face with the Russian, the want of fortified positions was so terribly felt that the troops were necessitated to throw up temporary fortifications, at a great sacrifice of health and life. The day before yesterday a person, who is probably well informed on the subject, stated that the Eastern war cost Astria 340,000,000., and 38,000 men, who died of various diseases in Galhc,a.
In October, 1856, experimentEs were made on a grand scale with gun-cotton. It was found to answer much better than gunpowder for mining (military) purposes, "us the explosive power was greater, and there was not the least smoke in the galleries." The artillery has already two "guncotton" batteries, but experiments3 are still made, aS it has been remarked that cannon charged with gun-cotton are more liable to bt than those in which powder is used.
*The compensation which. thls Government will give to the Austrian Danubian Steam Waigation Company for the loss of its monopoly was yesterday settled to the satisfction of both parties.

The present Penal Code of this country was promulgated in 1830, and was for the time a very enlightened measure; but now, under the influence of liberal ideas, the progress of science, and the reign of freedom, it has been found incompatible in many instances with the existing stats of society and constitutional institultions, particularly in the application of the punishment of death and in the punishment of crimes against relgion. In it there are 43 cases in which sentence of death may be pronounced, among which are 14 or 15 for political offences. Fortunately, there has always been a great moderation in the Government of this country, so that during the last 20 years the punishment of death has never been inflicted for a political crime; and even after the rebellion of Genoa, in 1849, there was no instance of a sentence of death; but for ordinary crimes the case bas been otherwise, and especially within the last five or six years there has been a superabundance of capital punishments, which has produced a great effect on both the country and its representatives. It is true that of late years two classes have been added to the Courts of Appeal, in order to expedite the disposal of cases in arrear, of which there were very many, and that has added much to the frequent condemnations. It is true also, as the Minister of Grace and Justice proved by oflicial documents, that, under the influence of liberty, the number of crimes has not increased, as some members of the Right asserted, but has, on the contrary, diminished. But, at the same time, it is a fact that the Penal Code is over prodigal of the punishment of death in a y- ing it notoly to homicides committed, but to a great many instances of attempted homicide. A long discussion took plate last year on this subject,and the Chamber then invited the Government to present a Bill for the reform of these two Draconian dispositions of the code. The Government has now complied with that order of the day of the House, by presenting a law for confining the application of capitsl punishment to crimes that are the immediate cause of death, or to attempts on the life of the King or a member of the Royal family. Tn all other cases-that is to gay, in four-fifths of those which the code now punishes with death-the law proposed reduces the punishment to imprisonment, with hard labour, for life.
Alter three days of debating, in which, while the danger of abolishing capital punishment altogether at present was fully recognized, wishes were expressed from aU sides for the arrival of the time when this abolition might be possible, the House approved the first article of the law containing the principle above mentioned.
The bill also provides modifications in the punishment of crimes relating to matters of religion. Blasphemy, for instance, according to the code, may be punishea by sentence to hard labour, though the enormity of such a punishment has been generally considered so revolting that it has hardly ever been applied. There have been istances, however, -of condemnations for reading the Bible in common, for blasphemies pronounced in public, &c. The Government, it is true, in these cases, as in those of duels, availed itself of the prerogative of mercy, and thereby mitigated the severity of the law, or its too rigorous application by a magistracy which does not always accommodate itself to the liberal principles of the Constitution. But these dispositions of the code demand correction, and it is only to be regretted that the correction proposed has not been in the sense of the fullest liberty of conscience. The first article of the Constitution recognizes the Catholic religion as the religion of the State, and this has in some degree embarrassed all that relates to perfect freedom of worship in the provincial towns of this country. However, as they have allowed the erection of Vaudois churches at Turin and Genoa, they endeavour also to reform the Penal Code in a liberal spirit; and they have, for example, reduced the m,xamum of punishment for blasphemy in public to three months of prison, and the minimum to six days, and these punish. rments are to be inflicted, says the Minister in his report on the BiU, not for the protection of religion but on account of the scandal arising from public blasphemy against the religion of the great majority of the citizens. This will be an appreciable amelioration of the code which sanctioned the condemnation of a man for blasphemy because he quoted a
passage from the New Testament in confutation of the doctrine of the immaculate conception.
This discussion, which has been carried on with great calmness and moderation, and in a very liberal spirit, will last two or three sittings more.
His Majesty of the Two Sicilies has recently introduced a new luxury into his prison discipline in addition to the many already existing. It is called a cap of sileneb (cziSla di sienzzio), and both for the particular purpose for which it is ostensibly applied, and as an instrument of torture generaUy,
1t may, perhaps, be considered superior mn refinement to the celebrated " iron mask" or any of the
engines of antiquity. The invention is due to the geniu of Signor Baiona, Inspectortof Police at Palermo, and it appears to have been so highly approved by the Kmig of Naples that he immediately decorated the talented and philanthropic gentleman with the order of Francis I.
This cap, or cuffla, consists of a circular band of steel, passing round the head just above the eyes, with a semicircular band of the same material connecting it over the top of the head from ear to ear; attached to this superstructure is a chin atrap of steel wire, growing broader towards the bottom, so as to confine the lower jaw completely, and make it
utterly impossible to riculate when the bands on the head are properly tcrewed up; and to complete the adjusment there is av -strap of leqthe rwith a buckle attached to the chin atrsp, Wthich 2ases

When the doctor and pne-st arrived Signor Baion.x consented to allow the cap to be removed from tfle unfortunate prisoner, who was at length restored to life, after a copious bleeding and other remedies; but he ordered a punishment of 16 blows of a stick to the gaoler, in order to check his over zealous charity in future.
A correspondence from Rome of the 17th inst., in the (orriUre Mercantile of Genoa, says:- -
" Fzom variou3 sources we learn a sad piece of news. The political prisoners in one section of Paliano attempted t. escape. Hwaing got upon the roof of the barrack they were surprised, and the new Commandant, Trasmondi, and the Lieutenant, Arranesi, ordered them to be fired at, while they defended themselves with the tiles of the roof, but four, at least, were killed, and five wounded. They say Miri, Rufini, Pasquelone, Cecchini, and Hassan are dead, and Sauli wounded. Nothing is known positively, because coirespondence with Piaano is interrupted.
" Give these facta every publicity. Explain that tbeie wretched men could not escspe because the wrere shut in by two surrounding walls. Show holwthe mild government of the priests treats humanity."
Private accounts from Rome confirmn the correctness of this statement in all essenitial particulars, and, indeed, the Roman official journal of the same date admits that there had been serious disturbances at Paliano, wherein four prisoners had been killed, and five severely woundedbythe troops, and states that the persons so killed or wounded were criminals who had been guilty of robberies and wounds committed from party spirit.
THE STATE OF NA-PLES.
(FROM OUR OW, ooOxRRoieNrar.)
-NAPLES, MI;Ao 19.
For several days the report has been circulatinQ' on the Exchange and in the city that the difficuties between the allied Powers and the Government of the Two Sicilies were, if not arranged, at least on. the point of being so. All that I know for certain is this, that a comunuication was made, directly or indirectly, by this Government, to the effect that it was ready to consent to apourparler on a given basis. This communication would arrive, it was expected, in Paris last Saturday night. The basis I have hea&rd mentioned is an enlargement of the Argentine treaty,-that is to say, a wider system of transportation is to be adopted, which is to be baptized "an amnesty," and so Hiis Majesty is to come forth clear from his present embarrassment. It is asserted by those who are supposed to be well informed, that the King begins to feel the extreme isolation of his position, and would willingly enter again into the comity of nations, but if it is by such a way as is now sugfgested it will reflect great dishonour on those who have withdrawn from his friendshipand leave all the elements of discontent andstrife as active as ever, because not a single social or political evil will have been removed. Of course, such an arrangement would be cheerfully accepted by a Government with its back to the wall, securinge to it, as it would, those objects so much desired by it; in the first place, the gratification of its vengeance against all, whether condemned or not,who might be hoatileto its system; and, secondly, the inviolability of that system. But would this be an adjust-
ment honourable to those who have done' all .that could well be done short of actual intervention to excite the hopes of the Italians? Or would it tend to calm that storm of passions which rages throughout the country? On the contrary, I believe it would be the signal for an explosion, and that it must come at last to the settlement of the Neapolitan question on the bases of justice and legality, and in such a Way as to promise rational progress to the people and tranquillity to Europe. England has the reputation here of being anxious to back out of what she has inconsiderately begun, and there are many who attribute to her the idea of the Argentine treaty. For the sake of our national honour and consistency let us hope that it is not so.
In spite o' my contradiction of a former statement that a new concordat was on the tapis, the report in some circles, still prevails.
There, has been of late a ratther too anxious attempt to bring before the pub]ic plans for the' material progress of the country. I look upon them with much suspicion, because of the time when they are brought forward, because of the very vague manner in which they are alluded to, and from a general want of confidence ineverything which ema. nates from this Government. I am sure that this want of confidence is not confined to the laberals, but is felt by all classes, and there is reason to fear that these demonstrations are intended to deceive foreign Governments, and to call off attention from the real necessities of the country. Until person and property be secure, no plans, however well they may loolk on paper, can flourish; and the laws will continue to be violated at pleasure until popular checks are put on arbitrary power.
believe I sin right in stating that the railway from Naples to Nocera has been sold by MX Bayard to a company in which the housw of Rothschild and a Paris house have a considerable interest. This will serve as the head to the Salerno and Taranto Railway, of which M. d'Agiout had the concession.
The Malacca came in yesterday morning, last from Messina, from wbich port she took four days to come up, with dead calms. In her cruise of 16 days she visited Palermo, Messina, and Syracuse. The Audacieuse, a fine new French frigate of 60 guns, came in last evening.

THE PAPAL STATES.-A letter from Rome of the
THE PAPAL S vExS.-A letter from Rome of the 20th says-In a Consistory held yesterday Cardinals Geissel and Heuclik, Archbishops of Cologno and Agram, received their hats. In the evening they held the usual receptions, which were both numerous and briliant. In the same Consistory 15 bishops were preconised, and among them were, for France, the mewv Arcbbishops of Paris, Tours, and Aix, and the new Bishops of Limoges, Belley, St. Denis, and La 1tanion. Cardin Altiers, Secretary of MSemorials, and formerly Nuncio at Vienna, has just been appointed successor to the late Cardinal Sforza, as Camarlinpo of the church. The Pope himself announc,d the nommation to the Cardinal immediately after the funeral of Cardinal Sforza. The Camarlingo is chief of what is called the Apostolical Chamber, nd formerly exercised the whole temporal power of the church, which is now divided among the different ministers At present his functions are merely nominal, but on the death of a Pope he alone exercises the Papal authority until theeonclaveis sumnmoned to elect a new Pope Alter the assemblin of the Conclave he, until the election is concluded, exercises the same authority in conjunction with three cardinals nominated by the Sacred College.
AN EXECUTION AT AlAsmz=Es.-lIatraccia, the Italian who, as reported in the Me&senger, was some abort time back condemned to death bythe Courtof Assizes of Aix for a series of extraordinary murders at Marseilles, was exeeuted in the latter city on Saturday morning. At 4 o'clock he was awakened by the chaplain and director of the prison and told that the petitiou for a commutation of punisheet which he had sent to the EmReror was rejected, and that he was about to be executed. He received the announcement with the greatest calmneosg and getting up, meated himself on the side of the bed, and took some coffee and smokedseveral cigars. At 6 o'clock he attended mass, and during the service he appeared very devout. The mass was followed by a sermon, which seemed to make a great impres3ion on-him. The service was attended by all the prisoners When it was concluded, Matraccia was taken back to his cell, and supplied with breakfast. Shortly before 7o'clock the clerk of the Court of Asaizes read to bim the text of his condemnation, the chaplain translating it into Italian. He liitened to the readng and translation with great resignation, and when they were concluded embraced the clerk and all the persons present, most of -whom were so affected that they abed tears Shortly after the executioners of Aix and xises, accompanied by an assistant, arrived, and proceeded to pinion the condemned. He was then freed from the irons on his legs, and he asked if he could not be allowed to walk to the scaffold, but was told that he must be conveyed in a cellular van. He then begged, as a special favour, that he might be accompanied by one of his friends, a countryman, who had been with himuall the morning, and thbathis parrot, which was in a cagein his ceD, might be taken with him to the scaffold. Bot these yequesta were granted, and he was placed in a van, the chaplain being in attendance on himi. Arsived at the scaffold, which was erected in the Place St. Michel, and which was surrounded by an immense crowd, conssting of at least 20,000 persons, the vehicle stopped, and the cage containing, the parrot was, to the surprise of the spectators, frst_placed on the scaffold; the criminal, his friend, and the chaplain then alighted from the van, Matraccia cast, a glance at the guillotine, and embraced several persons who were present. Then, supported by his friend and the chaplain, he ascended the steps of the scaffold, and in doing so it was observed that he sightly trembled. When he reached the platform he kisae with great fervour the crucifix which the ehapla,'n presented; then he embraced the chaplain and his frnenid, and then, turning to the parrot, he said i Italian, " Your master is about to die, and he embraces you for tho list time., Afterwards he advanced towardsthefrontof t-e scaffold, and cried to the people, " I demand pardon of tie inhabitmatg of Marseilles for the sandal I have ecldoned., Prly for me, forin a fewr minutes I'ill pray for -you.,' HIe was tben- seedbJ the executioners, andin few enoo

Macdougall's Theory Of War.*
M - L;H O WA
--EACDOUGAMLDS-THORY OR VAR-A_ -
As na nmaufu ros,eoi ale aduction the merits ot this *orkare sogeneiA2ly-admitted-in fact, they JAre so obvioi6s in rjpuct of the clearness and coneisdnsbs with which they-exponnd- and illustrate the -principles of the military art, that it woulld be super-
-luoui on our part to affect to set forth the further .groundsof a scientific natuie on which it has obtained the approval of professional judges. In the briefest compass the student is here provided with a complete treatise of strategy and tactics,-that is to say, according to the arbitrary distinction commonly recognized, with a view of the principles which regulate the movement of an army on the theatre of war, whether the enemy is, or is not, actually present or visible. How to preserve and how to forward an army to the place of battle, and how to make the most of its resources in the field; on the choice of a base and of a lin'e of operations, on the attack and defence of positions, on. manceuvring with the three arms, and on the moral as wel as material instruments at a commnander's disposal,-on all these topics this little volume eontains the fullest information in the form best fitted to impress the reader. General propositions, and even details on such a subject, are of little use without a copious reference to diagrams and examples, and here the diagrams are not only simplo and intelligible, but the examples are fuanished in sufiieieit number from the best known campaigns of the most celebrated commanders. Thus this work is available to the general student at the same time that it is expressly dedicated to the younger officers of the British Army, "in the hope that they may be induced to study the principles of their profession." Though we do not, as we said, affect to criticize its substance, one or two consideratioiis coupled with tnis latter object induce us more particularly to call attention to it at this moment, as it is most important and opportune that such points should be enforced with the sanetion derived from tO distinguished an austhority.
Every great riilitary IMower, as the LieutenantColonel observes, with the exception of England,
has organized thle educastion of its officers into an' institution of State; E:ven the United States, -which have no standing army worthy mention, have pro vided, by their establishment of West Pomt, a scientific professional education for all their officers, andfor such numbers of their citizens as (though not ostensibly in the a=rm) would qualify them to be excellent officers in ease of need.- t{i England alone. .the professional' education of- officers previous to-
joining the army has been purely voluntary up to the date of a recent regulation, by which they are required to pass an examination. But little or no: guarantee of professionai qualifications is thus afforded, for no part of this examination is profes-
ional, except in fortifieation, the amount of pro. ficiency required in which the Lieutenant-Colonel asserts may easily be acquired by any youth of average intellect in a week. Such is the sum of: the professioual iraiuiing and probation thought re- g quisite for youths before they are permiitted to enter and take rank in the British army.
The new systei of depOt battalions and of large camps will unquestionably afford them greater oppthei of receiving such training after joining tbeir respective regituents. But it is to be feared that these will be opportunities only, and will not amount to obligations capable of overcoming theo ris iner&e and the natural lindisposition to confinemnent and study. So far as examinations for promotion have becil tried as a stimulus to professional education they are " an adinitted failure," and the Lieutenant-Colonel evidently thinks we have accomplished very itte if we turn the schoolboy just emancipated from school into an officer and expen t him to qualify himself voluntarily for his profession afterwards. His plan wonld be rather to dispense with the general education which is now required, or to leave this to be voluntary, as it used to be, and to substitute the professional training as the indispensable element. WEe would therefore oblige aU officers before appointment to paw sx or eight months at a central military school, where they should receive practical instruction in field fortification, surveying, outpost duty, reconnoitring, &c, all based, however, on a good elementary teaching of the theory of the art of war, commonly called strategy and tactics." Let the State be less solicitous about the general qualifications of the officer, for these may ordinaifly be vCalculated upon, and will indeed be included to a very great degree in the speeial education of the soldier; but lot it all events, insure his military training by taking that special training into its own hands. Then the officer will come under charge of the State with such an amount and such a description of knowledge as will enable him to profit to the utmost by the practical instructions which must folow his entry upon military service. He wil be inore likely then to desire to be something more than a peg on which to hang a red coat, and he will probably devote his attention to learning his duties, and because of the interest with which they are invested by his fuler knowledge of their bearings he wiU therefore be more disposed to perform them conscientiously.
On the subject of these duties any young officer will unquestionably do well to study the present volume, for on some even of the most elementary functions of his profession he may learn to look with new interest in consequence of its instructions. We subjoin a specimen of this latter class as more fitted for selection herethan discussions of the merits of campaigns and plans of battles .-
1lst DrilL-This must not be acquired mechanically, but intelligently. The Ireason why' of everything should be puzzled out. Many young gentlemen go through it as an irksome task, the fulfilment of which will set tnem free from the Ihorrid nuisance' of those three daily parades. When dismissed drill it must not be suppofed that everything is, but that everything is to be, learnt. The younr officer should study the mancauvres in the drill-book, &an practise himself in his own room, with wooden divisions, m all the movements of the company and battalion, until he misters both thoroughly. lie must not be satisfied, however, with being able to move bodies of men in the various formations laid down by regulation; but he must study the advantages of each formation and know under what circumstances one is better than another, and why.
"2d. All the details of the management and interior economy of his company ahould be thoroughly learnt by the young soldier, comprising arms, clothing, food, pay. n ent, punishments, rewards, J;c, after which a knowledge of the management of a regiment wil be easily acquired.
"3d. Orderly duty should be done conscientiously and with interest. A gentleman should consider it to be as disgraceful to sign his name at the bettom of a report of which the items are not strictly true as to teU a deliberate falsehood. Every day on which an officer has performed his duty negligently he has morally obtained money (viz., his pay for that day) under false pretences.
" 4th. To command men worthily it is not sufficient to hold the Queen's commission in one's writing-desk. An officer should acquire such influence over his men that they will be eager to do his bidding and to follow him anywhere. The possession of that influence is the peculiar mark of a good officer: and it cannot be acqired without the know. edge of the names of the soldiers and the study of their individual characters. Some officers never even learn the names of the men of their own companies, much less study their dispositions. A knowledge of character, however, is indispensable in tbe proper management of men. If two men were framed like t o locomotives, of precisely the same number of pistons and cranks, urged by the same amount of steam, the same management might do for both, but since that is not the case the same treatment will have a very different effect on different characters In dealing with men, therefore, knowledge of human nature as wel as discretion and temper are required. Some officers, from theirpeculiar temperament, work themselves up into a passion when ordering a punishment An officer should never allow a soldier to thinklthat he is punishingan offence against himself personally. ildness of manner is quite compatible with inflecxibility of action, aud produces a far greater effect than violence in combination with it."
But aSrset ioi ureso iei h
field again we repeat our general recommendation of the present volume.

The Soldiers In The China War.
THE SOLDIERS IN THE CHINA WAR.
TO THS EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
"With the soldier we have a gret dea to defend; without him
we should seon hare vey Ti ttle weth defending.'
Sir,-I would earnestly request your insertion of this communication in your journal, or, what would be far more effective, that you take up the subject yourself, ana in a leading or prominent article set the matter in your owzn powerful and attractive way before the public.
Of the four regiments now about to embark for China three have not long since returned from the Crimea. Such alternations of climate, such varied service afford an apt illustration of the claims of the soldier upon the citizen. There are now at our ports, awaiting a econd and more painful separation from their husbuads and fathers, some hundreds of women and children, who, unless sometbing be done for them at once,, must become inmates of our work. houses-a prospect not calculated to nerve the arm or lighten tho heart of many a fine fellow who may havo to brace the one in the great odds he is golng to encounter, and to cheer up the other under the far greater dangers of climate to which he lll be exposed.
If ever there was a whir which gave the soldier strong claims upon the citizen, it is the one upon which we are now about to enter, and of the fature proportions of which we can at present form no estimate. This war, it not undertaken for, at any rate rises out of pure commercial considerations. Mammon should provide for the legitimate claims of those who fight for him.
o You ill not preah to deaf ears. The sens of the good effected by the operations of the society for relieving the wives and families of soldiers during the Iate war is not yet obliterated from the puble heart. The organization for working it may readily be resumed. It requires but your advococy to reconstruct an association which shall, in a more efficacious way, bat upon a smaler le, carry to the homes of the absent soldier the relief which during the last war was in too many instances of necessity adminiatered to their wives by district associations, for which I think a parochial distribution might be advantageously substituted through the means of Post-office remittances.
This, with a proper system of allotment of a certain portion of his pay by the soldier {upon the principle adopted in the navy), would meet the requirements of the case; bat I would venturo to suggest, for your better consideration, whether it would not be wise for the Poor Law authorities to help to keep these poor people out of the workhouses by some small woekly allowance, in aid of the soldiers' own allotments of pay, and of the proceeds of private benevo. lence, and of their own industry.
While acknowledging the claims of the xoldier under existing circumstances, there are many who do not so readily admit those of their wives and children. Upon this subject I would desire he add that during the lie
war I acted as chairman of a local committee for the relief of upwards of 100 soldiers' wives. I have been many years in tho army, and until thrown into daily intercourse with these women I had formed a very wrong estimate of the generaUy undervalued soldiers' wives. Under the foregoing circumstances I can honestly say I had every reason to be highly satisfied with the conduct of the women relieved by our local society. I was fortunate enough to obtain employment for many of them; without one single exception, I received most gratifying testimonials from their employers. Many of them brought me their husbands' letters to read, and I can conscientiously affirm that these portrayed in the strongest manner that the soldier has kept pace with the advances of other orders of society. Their letters were such as tomako me feel shame at having so inadequately seized, during a long service, the true salient points in the soldier's mind in its best phase.
I do not sign my name to this communication. I givo it in the accompanying note, not wishing that it should appear. I am willing, however, to meet any friends to the cause who may apply to me, in the hope that, from my acquaintance with such matters, I maxy be able to render tome assistance in giving effect to the object herein advocated. Your obedient servant,
Manchester And The Soulages Collection.-
BMA.CHE5TEE AND TEE SOiULAAS COLLECON.- A publi act, nad one at the present moment, in every way graceful and enlightened, has just been performed in Manchester. What the Chancellor of tho Exchequer declined to do with an unwise fear of his constituenh, and an nnwiser fear of the House of Commons, has been done quicly and well in Mlanchester by seven men of different shades of politics, constitutigthe executiveCommittee of the Art Treasures Exhibition The Chancellor of the Exchequer had, it is said, included in the miscellaneous estimates of the session a vote for the purchase of the far-famed Soulages Collection. This he his since erased, and the Soulages collection of art was returned only last week on the hands of the committee of purchasers. At this contingency the seven men constituting the Art Treasures Exhibition Committee stept in and bought the collection outright on their own responsibility, and out of their own seven purses, What has been seen in part and imperfectly wiU now be seen in the Art Treasures Exhibition at Manchester complete, and to the best adv!ntage. Nor has the collection thus obtained been bought with the remotest view of any individual benefit. At the termination of the exhibition, the seven citizens of Manchester will offer the collection to the city of Manchester at the price they paid for it, the original price at which it was offered to Her Majesty's Government. Failing acceptance it willagain be offered(we hope in better times) to Her Majestys Government for the time being - and in case of a second refusal, it will be sold by auction, and the loss, whatever it may be, sil be sustained by the seven disinterested Manchester gentlemen, while the profit, whatever the profit may be (and it will certainl be great) will be hande over to the original committee of purchasers for some national purpose connected with the arts of England. The purchase-money is stated to be 13,5001.
SOM-nD Rus.-The following official notice, announcing the termination on and after the 1st of April next, vnder certain provisional regulations, of the Sound Dues, has been received from the Board of Trade :-" Board of Trade, Whitehall, Mrch 24-The Lords of the Comnitbee of Privy Council for Trade and Foreign Plantations herehb give notice that, by virtue of a treaty concluded on the 14th inst. between Great Britain, Austria, BelgFlm, France.

Until, however, certain engagements of the tre3ty towards Denmark shall have been fulfilled by the contracting parties it has been agreedthat the Danish Government shaU have the right to maintain a provisonal state of thinga in the Sound, by taking from vessels passing through secu ity for the payment of the dues intended to be abolished, such aecurityto becancelledand discharged as soon as the countr by whose vessels it has been given shall havefulfiled the said engagements. The owners and masters of British vessels re therefore apprised that, although actual pa)mentof the Sound Dues wil not be required, yet, until further notice, it will be necessary for them to give security for the amount of such dues. 'his may be done by the master ending his papers either on shore or to the guardship, accompanied by a signed declaration, undertaking, in case of the non-fulfilment of the engagements aforesaid, to pay the amount of dues with which, according to his papers, he may be chargeable for the vessel and cargo. The particular attention of masters and owners is requesed to this notice, in order that they may not incur inconvenience or loss by neglecting the roquiredformalities. Notice is also hereby given that from and after the 1st of April the Danish transit duties on aU the roads and canals which connect the North Sea and the EIbe with the Baltic will be reduced to the uniform rate of 16 E!illings, Danish currency, per 501b. DaDish; the exernmtions which now exist on some of those roads or canals in favour of certain enumerated articles of home or foreign production being extended to all ofthem."

Mr. Burford's Panorama.
AR. BURFORD'SPAVORAMfA.
-- - - ---ot
GBided aS usual by the events of the day, Mr. Burford lis nust added to'i stock of panoramas a muagnificent picture of 3Ioscow, With tho entrance of the presetu Emperor intothe
outheo nofbscoronation. hespecttor ~s ~isp8oed to sttand on the esplanade o,f the Krenilin itself, aisd will probably begin his EUrVey with the Imperial Palace and the three Cathedrals of the Annunciation, St. Mich+el, and the Twwelve Apostles, which are all crowded together as if parts of one building. As he moves to the right the lofty
cSt. Jon's Tower," the tallest structure in the city, will mee Itiseye,andhe will observe at its foot the greatbeU, WAth its door-like fracture. Passing over several buildings, important enough in themselves, but less ch,racteristie than the others, he will next stop to observe the " Sacred Gate," throu4h which the coronation procession is entering. Still further to the r;ght is the Cathedral of the Virgin, sparklng with its parti-coloured domes, and perfectly unique from its itter wast of unity. AU these buildings are within the precincts of the Kremlin, but a conLtinuation of his journey will soon bring the spectator to the edge of the Mtuskowa river, across which the other portion of the city is discernible. The foreground of that part of the picture in which the principal buildings are represented is occupied by the procession, in lvhich all the leading person3ges connected wvith the ceremony are introduced.
This picture may be con-idered one of Mr. Burford's mostifelicitous productions. The various and fantasticarchi. tecture of the old Russian capital is aminently suited to the werposes of his art, and he has executed all his details with 1US usual care and finish. By the point of viesw he has selected heo not only carries out his old principle of contrasting 1he massive buildings on one side of his picture with an oxtensiveprospect on the other, but takes the be-st position for surveying the objects of historical interest.

TEE BRAZILIAN MAILS.
TO THE EDITOR OF TRE TIMES.
Sir,-There is a large business transacted between this country and the Brazils, and but one regular monthly mail,
on the 8th of each month. Of late another line has bee4. established, from Liverpool once a-month to Pernambuco and Bahia, but not to Rio Janeiro, and thus far it has been irregular, and not to be relied on.
A new line has now been established with fast boats from Eamburg to Rio, calling at Southampton, and the Postoffice refuses to receive letters for this lhe, and prohibits the company's agents at Southampton from collecting letters for it, thus closing this desirable means of comrmunication to those persons in this country to whom, rare as the opportunities of writing are, it would prove of considerable advantage.
We do not wish to appear as agitators in this matter, bat. think it right to enclose you a copy of a letter we addressed to the Post-office, and of the reply we received, leaving, it to you to call attention to the subject if yot deem it expedient.
We are respectfully. Sir, your obedient servant-.
-HiERMAN SILLEL. SON. Awn IC)
2, Crosby-square, March 24.
" London, 2, Crosby-square, Mareh 19:
Sir,-We perceive from a paragraph in the newspapers that Messrs Croskey and-Co., at Southampton, agents for the steamers which run between Harnburg and Soathampton and the Brazils, have been prohibited by the Post-office authorities from receiving letters to be forwarded by these steamers: nor will the Post-office, as we have been informed on inquiry there, receive such.
- We cannot bht think that there must be some misunderstanding here, and therefore address you to inquire how the matter stands. The Leatonia leaves Southampton at the beginning of next week, the 24th or 26tb, and, as we have important advices to send to the BrazWil, we are of course anxious to write by her. Please state *vhat mode se are to adopt in order that our letters may be sent offand we incur no risk of acting contrary to law.
"le are, Sir, yoar ,sost obedient servants,
" REAIN~ SILLEM, SON, AND CO. Rowland Hill, Esq., Post-office,

" General Post-office, March 23.
Gentlemen,-In reply to your letter of the 19th inst., I beg to acquaint you that, under the arrangeenjets now in force, no mails are despatched from this country by foreign prnvate steamers.

JonN PATIMO.W, an;uSirJoHN DoDsoN.i
Theseo casm were argued at the commencemient of the present month, and reported iii 1%e Times of the 3d and 5th nst. As the principles involved in them were in some reqct~s very similar,
heir LOBDss Dnow delivered the following combinedl judgment :-Tbis is an appeal from a decree of the High. Court of Admiralty, dated August 8, 1856. condemning the cargo of the ship Gerasimo as lawful prize. At the time of ner capu tis bws bound for 'Tieste with a cargo
of Indian corn, which sbe bad taken on board at Galatz. l She was sailing under Wallachian colours, and pn the1 19th of July, 18, during the prosecution of her vae
was she was coming out of the Sulina mouth of the Danube by Her Majesty's ship Vesuvius, under the command of Captain PowelL. It was the duty of the captors, as soon as possible, to send their prize to somne convenient port in Ier Majesty's dominions for adjudication, to procure the examaination in preparatory of the principal offcers of the vessel, and to depositin the Admiralty Court, uon oath, all papers found on board the vessel, in order
Mat speedy justice might he done, and that the pro- 1 perty, if illegally seized, might be restored with as little delay as possible to the owners, None of these steps
wero taken. On the 21st of June, 1855, a claim was , brought into the Admiralty Court by ML Cremidi, in which he claimed the cargo on behalf of Epaminondas Pana and Co., who are merchants at Galatz, and on their behalf demnanded restitution with costs and damages, and at the same time he sued out a monition requiring the captors to proceed to adjudication. The captors proceeded accordmngly, and on the 14th of November, 1855,. the case was heard upon the claim. There was an absence of the usual evidence in such casesthere wvas no examination of theowitnesses in preparatory, no affidavit verifying the ship's papers made reccnte facto, but an affidavit sworn by Captain Powell on the 30th of August,
1'855, more than 12 months after the seizure, verifying der-.
tain papers as being all the papers wbich were found on - hoard the vessel, and none of which related to the cargo. Tbe captors, howveovr, produced an affidavit by agentle-
man named Young, who stated that he was the agent. in England of the captors, and that he had received a. letter from Captain Powrell, dated in the month of MKay, 1855, in. forming him that the cargoes of this and other sbips sent to Constantinople had been aold at that place, with the consent of the owners thereof, and the proceeds deposited in the hands of an agent. There was also a certificate by Mfr icholson, wvho bad been sent out (under what circumstahnces, it does not appear) as a comm issioner appointed by the Court of Admiralty to take evidence on the subject at Constantinople, and Mrt. Nicholson thereby certified that he bad been info:med that the master and the whole of the crew, of the Gerasimo had long since quitted her, and could not. anywhere be found. The onlyevidence of property on the part of the claimant was the affidavit of Cremidi, who stated his belief that E. Pana and Co., subjects of the Ionian Islands, were the owners, andthat no enemyhadanyinterest in it. Neither the affidavit nor the claim stated anything as to theplace of residence of E. Pana and Co. Thelearned judge therefore made an order, dated November 14, 1855, by which he admitted the claim of Cremidi for the cargo, but directed further proof to be given by the claimaant as to the property thereof, and also allowed both parties to bring in further proof as to the non-examination. of witnesses in preparatory, and as to whether there was any agreement as to the sale of the cargo, such: further proof to be given without prejudice to the question of costs and damages. The cause was heard on further proof in July and August, 1856, when the learned judge was of opinion that the claimant was to be considered as an enemy of the British Crown at the time of the seizure, and that he- had, therefore, no persona stesrsdi in the court. lpon the present appeal, the first question is whether the apellant m regard to this claim is to be considered as an alien enemy. UJpon the general principles of law applicable. to this subject there can ho no dispu, The national character of a trader is to be decided for the purposes of the. trade by the national cbaracter of the place in which it is carried on. Nothing can be more just than this principle;.but the whole foundation of it is, that the country in which the merchant trades is enemy's country, Now,
the question iS What are the circumstances necessary. to convert friendly or neutral territory into enemy's terri. tory s For this p. -rpose is it sufficient that the territory in question should be occupied by a hostile force, and subjected duilug its occupation to the control of the hostile Power, so far as such Power may think fit to exercise control; or is it necessary that, either by cession or conquest, or some other means, it should, either permanently or temporamily, be incorporated with and form part of the dominions of the invader at the time when the question of national character arises? ItappearstotheirLordahips that tbe first proposition cannot be maintained It is impossible for any judge,' however able and learned, to have always present to his mind all the nice distinctions by which general rules are restricted- and their Lordsbipe are inclined to think that, if the autisorities which were citeel and so ably commented upon at this bar had been laid before Dr. Lushington, he' would, perhape, have qualified in some degree the doctrine attributed to him in the report to which we have referred. With respect to the meaning of the teram " dominions of the enemy," And what is necessary to constitute dominion, Lord Stowell has in several cases expressed his opinion " the Famia" (5 Rob. 114). That the national character of a place is nob changed by the mere circumstance that it is in the possession and under the control of a hostile force is a principle held to be of such importance that it was acted upon by the Lords of Appeal in 1808, in the St. Dosino cases of " the Dart " and 'H Hp"y Couple," when the rmpe operated with extreme hardshilp. In the case of "The
asUMa " l( Edw.. 3), Lord Stowell gives an account of those decisions. When places in a friendly country have been seized by and are in possession of the enemy, the same doctrine has been held. The same principle has been acted upon in the courts of common law, " Donaldson v. Thompson" (1 Campb., N.P.R., 429). The propositions, however, there contended for were repudiated by Lord Ellen. borough, and afterwards, on a motion to set aside the verdict by the Court of King's Bench, Lord EUlenborough observed, "Will any one contend that a Government whichisobliged to yield in anyquarter to superiorforce. becomes a co-beligerent with the Power to which it yields ? It may as well be contended that 'neutral' and ' belligerent' mean the same thing." Thesanmedoctrinewasafterwardslaid down by the Court of King's Pench,in the case of "Hagedorn v. Bell" (1 Maule and Sel., 450). The distinction between hostile occupation and possession clothed with a legal-right by cession or confirmed by length of time. is recognized by Lord Stowel in the case of '-the Boletta "1 (I Edw., 171). These authorities, with the other'casbs cited at the bar, seem to establish the proposition that the miere possession of a territory by an enemy's force does not of itself necessarily convert the territory so occupied into hostile territory, or its inhabitants into enemies. Their Lordships then referred to the nature of the possession of Moldavia held by the Russians at the time when the shipraent in question was made, and went on to say,-It seems itmpossible to hold that, by means of an occupation so taken, so continued, and so terminated, MIoldavia ever became part of the dominions of Russia and its inhabitants subjects of Russia, and therefore eneiies of those with whom Russia was at war. The utmost to which the occupation could be held to amount was a temporary suspension of the sueraMiu of the Porte, ind a temporary assumption of that su=eraincM by Russia. At what period, then, could foreigners dweling there be said to have that notice of a change in the dominibn and in the laws under which theywere to live to which Lord Stowell refers in the case of the " Fama "P At what peribd were they under the obligation of changing their domicile in it, under the penalty, if they oraitted to do so, of being treated as enemies of Great Britain? Moldavia and Wallachia were not treated by the Porte as enemics, and it would be singalar if these countries, though not held to be enemies by Turkey, should be held to be enemies of the allies of Turkey. - That the Wallachian flag was recognized botli by the Russian and Turkish authorities sufficiently appears from the documents before the Court; and their Lordships have ascertained, by communication with the Foreign-office, that no act was ever done by the British Government to change the national character of the provinces in relation to Great Britain; and without some such act the occupation by the Russians under the circumstances stated could not produce such an effect. Being of oDinion, therefore, that the claimant has a persona standi in the court, we have now to consider the effect of the evidence upon further proof with reference to the three points-the property, the sale, and the omission to examine witnesses, and upon nohe of these points are thoy able to find any serious doubt. At Constantinople, where the facts were probably known, aid, at all events, were capable of easy proof, no doubt was ever suggested as to the fact of Pana and Co. being owners 'of the cargo through the whole of the long proceedings which led to the sale. They were dealt with, both by the captors and the shipowner, as the proprietors; they were called upon in that character to pay the freight; they were called upon in that character to consent to the sale; they were called upon in that character to be responnsible for the amount in case of condemnation; and can it be argued thatthey are only to betreatedas owners in case of condemnation, and not in caseof restitution? Atthe hearingof theclaim none of thes facts appeated. At the hearing on further proof, the view taken of the case by the learned judge made it unneceesaty to investgate them. The affidavit of la Fontaine was calculated to mislead anybody who had not carefully examiued the documents to which it refers; the inaccuracies in it were not pointed out at this bar, and were probably, therefore, not rought to the notice of Dr. Lushington. As to the sale, the evidence clearly shows that it took place under circumstances which cannot in the least prejudice the right of the owners to relief. Then as to the excuse for the non. examination of the witnesses. There is literally none wh4tever. What is the value of a statement byhM. Ia Fontaine of Iwhat the exigencies of the public service would or would not permit? What know^ledgffe has he upon the subject.
even it what-appearS in thia case was calculated tO inOluce the Courtto place entire-onfidence on his accuracy? But, if the exigencies of the public service did nnt pbrmit the sending theso vessels either to England or to Malta, are the claimants to suffer? It was strongly insisted by the apol.
lants that the penalty on the captors for ornitting to comrny with the rules of the Admiralty Court, if unaccounted for or not sufficiently explained,was a forfeituro of all their rights and restitution to the claimants. with costs and damases ; and many auehorities were cited which were sueposet t warrant that proposition. It j& not, -in their iordshiW view, neceisary to adopt in this case so severe a rule, ad' they think it will lie mnore satigfacto;y to. pxamine tite grounds on which itis attempted to jnstify the aeizare aid on which condemnation is required. 'The ground hOw Suggested is, that tho Gerasimo was guilty of a breach of blockade in coming out of the Danube when the months of thit river were in a state of notified blockade. It is Fingular tbat, if this were the ground of capture, no notice what ever of the blockade should have been contained in the atldavit originaUy prepared for Captain Powel to swear when the seizurewas made and the factswererecent, that noticeof it should beintroduced for the first time in the affidavitmade by him on the 30th of Augnabt, 1816;, and sthat even in that late affidavit it is not stated that breach of blockade wasthe cause of seizure, There is . sno dosbt t, b9wevpo .that. breach of bked oe, ;F,e,Wjei it cap the c;uisof Weizure or not, may.
be nerd a groud of oorndemnation-if the cErcumsanoeeef bhe-sse bring it within the law.r Whit, then, were the eircumabances? lIn the umer of 1854 the Ruan forces in the Turkish territories wore straitened for provisious. The.allitd fleets desired to prevent the importation of provisions up the Danube, and with that view the two admirab -n command of the English and French feets issued a proclamation, dated June 2, 18R4, in which they declared to all whom it might concern that they had established an effective blockade of the Danube, in order, to
top all transport of provisions to the Russian nrmies; they declared that this blockade included all those mouths of the Danube which communicate with the Black Sea, and they apprized all vessels of every nation that they will not be able to enter the river til further orders-" 'qils ne pourront entrer dans co flenve jusqu's nonvel cidre." On the 26th of June the Russisas forbade all export of cereals after the 2d of July. Any exportation of cereals, therefore, was in furtherance of the objects of the allies, and to the prejudice of the Russians. Could. a moldavian mercbant imagine, if he had heard of this blockade. that he was to be liable to capture by the allies for exporting provisions, when the whole prse of the blocle
was declared to be to prevent their import? But by the rnes of law a ship whicb has entered a blockaded port before the blocksde is entitled to come out again; and if the has a cargo taken on board before notice of the blockade she is entitled to bring it out. The blockade of a port is p7rminfacie notice of the existence of the blockade to all who are within it, because the inhabiteats who see the blockade ships off their coast cannot be well ignorant of the blockade. But this was no blockade of the port of Glalatz, but anblockade of the mouths of the Danube, Galatz lying on its banks np the river at a distance of 150 miles from its mouth. In this case the ship had entered the river before the blockade; the cargo was taken on board on the 30th of June, and the ship must have sailed on or before the 2d of July-, otherwise abh would have been detained by the Russians. If she had no. notice of the blockade she was, on that general ground, entitled to bring out her cargo; if she had notico she never could suppose that, according to the notification, she could be liable to capture; hut if the case had been open to any6suspicion, though, in fact, there is none, no weight could bo given to such suspicion, when the claimant has been deprived, *br the wrongful act of the captors, of the opportunity~ of affording the explanations which the rules of law wrere intended to cecure to him. What dlaim the captor mayr haveupon H aer3Mjesty's Govermnoment it' not therduty to Judge, nor have they any means of forming an opinion. But as regards the clamnts his conduct appears to be w ithout any excussi and their Lordships have no hesitation in advisng restitution of the cargo, with costs and damages against the captor.
As regards the claimant, this case differs in. nO materiaV particular from t'sat whEich has just been decided, and the same decree mus be pronounced. As between the captor and the Crown there may be a very material distinction, as the death of Captain Parker in the service of his country, within a very fewr days after the capture1 relieves him from personal blamne, In respect of the gross mregularities which have since taken place.
vHE{ SHIP ACHILLES
This case differs from the two which have just been diuposed of in this circumstance, that the claimant's right of
property is not sufliciently established. The claim is made. on behalf of Paolo FOCCR, as the role owner;X the ship's papers do not establish the title, but, on the contrir, throw some doubt upon it, and the agreement mlade viith the captain on behalf of the owvners does not show w ho the* owners are. Considering, however, the hardships impsed en the claimants by the course pursued by the captors, their Lordships will admit the claimants to further proof as to the propert. The other facts are aulliciently clear, and theydl not orderfurther proof as to them.

STOURTON V. TOmTON.
(Beform e iLORDS JUSTICES of APTMA.)
* An unjustifiable complainthas been made by the soliditors forLord Stourton thst in irrelevant conversation which followed the judgment of the Court in the above-mentioned important cas, relating to mtters which the leading counsel for that noble psonage admitted were not In evidence, was not reported in 'h Times. This is somewhat hard upon the re,corter, considering that the judgment of* t.he Court was given at considerble, and certainly at a snfcident length. In ordler, however, that no further dissatisfaction my riso,0 much as follows may be stated ,nuereasonble request contained in the letter of the solicitors above referred to.
Mr. BAGSHAWz stated, on behalf of Lord, Lady and the Hon. Mr. Stourton, that numerous remonstrances had be"n made as to the infant being permitted by the family to be brought up as he had been, but admitted that this fact was not in evidence under his (Utr. Bagshawe's) advice. The learned counsel also said that the prospectus of the Jesuits' Seminary had been "expressy withdrawn before the Master of the Rolls," admitting also that this fact too was not in evidence. This prospectus, it is pMin, had been "put in," or
it could not have been "withdrawn." The same learned!, counsel furthermore stated that "Lord Stourton would be perfectly willing that the Court should select any Echool that might be right." The remainder of the copy of the coiversation which ccompanies the letter of comulaint is made up of compliments by counsel towards Lord Stourton, and complimentary expressions of a pprobation from Lord Jns. tice Knight Bruce towards Mr. Bagshwe, coupled however with an expreEs declaration that the Court had taken a correct view of the evidence before it..
It is now tolerably obvious that the remarks were rad
with a view to their publication in the newspapers, and - hence the complaint of their omission But it may be asked what benefit persons expect to gsin from puhlishing the fact that they did not put in evidence what ought to have been proved, withdrew what never ought to have been produced, nd consented to the Court selecting chool, which the Court would select wholly regardless of such consen7t?

(Before ac x&snof afiRLoLS.)
In this case an issue had been directed to try the validity of the will of the late Mr. Macaulay, of Christoburob, Hants, and on the trial of this issue at the Winchester summer amizes the jury had found a verdict against the will, on the ground that the testator was of unsound mind when he made it. The present application was for the direction of a new issue, on the plea that the verdict of the Winchester jusymen was against evidence. The testator,' it was alleged, was a man of great and somewhat dirty eccentricities, putting on a clean shirt only two or three times a year, and otherwise expressing an indesczibable aversion to conduct himself with decency. In early life he ran away from his home and his friends, and for some time before his death eonfined himself exclusively within his bedroom, without any apparent reason for such seclnsion. Manyyears ago the testator had made a will infavour of one of his sisters, inxwhich he made the condition of ber enjoying his property to be that " after his death sbe should have his head severed from his body, have both head and body pnt-not in a coffin-bot in a sack, and have the sack and its mutilated con-. tents thrown into the sea, six railes from shore." This will the testatOr subsequently revoked by making another, by which he left sll his property to hbis hou.ekeeper anadber children. Thetestator's family disputedthe validity of the second will on the grounds above stated, as. well as upon certain other evidence of his peculiar habits, such as roaring of a night like a cow, preferring, though a man of easy competency, to go to prison for 100 daysrather tban pay a debt of 1., and many other actswhich it was contended would, taken together, clearly prove him to have been a person of unsound mind. It was aso indstedun
that the testator was prone to insanity, from the at of that disease being in the family, and his brother and present heir-at-law, Mr. Urry Macaulay, having for many years been in a lunatic asylum. On the part of those entitled under the second will, it was contended that all the aflega. tions above set forth were greatly exaggerated; that the tes. tator was perfectly capable of managing his own affirs when he made his will; and thae the testator al his life had been particularly remarkable for his acuteness in money matter
and in the detection of the selfsh objects of those who now sought to frustrate his final determination with respect to' his property. After hearing the arguments and affdivits on both sides,
His HoNoUR said he would reserve his judgment, al. though his present impression was that the testator, though eccentric, knew very well what he was about, and was quite capable of making a valid wilL As the expense of a new Iasue, however, would be very great, he suggested that the parties should effect some compromise during tho vacation,
so as to render his passing judgment either one iay or the. other unnecessary.
Mr. H. Palmer, Wr. Selwyn, Mr. Faber, and Mr. Bevir appeared in the case.

MIr. C. Rourxu, appesred upon a petition in this cause, the chief question of interest arising upon it being whether the infant children of William Adams could give up their' interest in oertain copyrights under these circumstances - Mr. William Adams was the author of several well-known relgiou s works. Ie made a will, and left also three informal testamentary instraments or memoranda, by the first of which he desired that any editions of Te Warnings of the Holy We&c should go to the fund for building a school and church at Bonchurch; by the second that the profits
arising from his works called The Sludow of the Cross andThe Distant Hills should go to found colonial bishoptics, and that the Fall of C,aa and 2he Old Man's Home should go to the fund for additionl curates in En land; and by the third the profits of a work called The gs AMessger for the education of the sons of the clergy. One third of the property in these copyrights became eventually the property of the widow of John Adams, brother of
William Adams, and the other two-thirds of his (John's); infant children. The widow was willing that her one-third should be devoted to the purpcses expressed in the testamentary memoranda, and it was wished that the children's share should be applied in the same manner.
The VICE-CHABCxLoR said that he much regretted that he could not accede to the latter part of what was asked. It would be, in fact, giving away the children's shares. The copyrightsmnust be sold; one-third paid to the widow, and the other two-thirds must be carried to the account of the children.

It was contended, on the plaintiff's bebalf, tbht the purchae was not completed on the 4th of Angust, 1855, by delivery of the check for 600L to Mr. Tattersall; but that when it was completed by acul payment of that amount the purchaser, Mr. Obbard, hid notice of the plaintiff's charge, and therefore bought subjoct to it. The defendant, on the other hand, contended thit the purchae ws completed on the 4th of August, 1855, and he also alleged that the plaintiff had agreed to take other leasehold property as a security in sabstitution of No. 25, Carlton-hl east. The case was opened last Friday, and was conduded to day.
Mr. Mains and Mr. Chapman Barlow were for the plain. tiff; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Pole for Mr. Obbard, the purchaser; Mr. Osborne for Mr. Turner; and Mr. W. J. Bovill for Mr. Lodge.
The VICAg-CHAqAczcLoB sid that the evidenoe showed Mr. Obbard to have been an incautious and careless purchaser, and that the attempt to show that the purcbase was completed on the 4th of August, 185, entirely failed. The other part of the defence, to the effect that the plaintiff had agreed to take a security on othar property in substitution of the house in Calton-hill East also failed, and on the whole case he thought the pDl intiffentitlcd to a, decree, and that the defendant fr. Obbard should pay so much of the costs of the suit as were ooca: donel by his resi g the plaintiff's right to redeem.

A question important to trustees and purchasers of
perty under a sale from them was raised by this case, he testator had given real egtes to three trustees, John Woodhead1 Tyas, and Wcbster, in trust to selL is will Was dated in 832 and contained a power, in case the said trustees, or any of them, should die or be desirous of being discharged, or should refuse or decline to act, or becombe incapable of acting, for the surviving and continuing trustees or trustee, or sbe executors or administrators of ie last or continuing trustee, by deed or any instrument to be executed as therein mentioned, to nLominate, substitute, or appoint any person or persons to be a trustee or trustees in
the stead or place of the trustee or trustees so dying or desiring to be discharged, or refusing or declining, or becoming incapable to act. One trustee, John Woodhead, died in the testator's lifetime. The testator himself died in 1844 The other two trustees, Tyas and Webster, declined to ot. By a deed dated in Febrnary, 1845, both of them appointed the plaintiff, Nicholson, and one William Woodhead, as trus; tees in their room, and conveyed the premises to them. Tyas died shortly afterwards. W. Woodhead died in 1852. A sale took place by order of Nicholson, when an objection was takte to the title, on the ground that there was no valid execution of the power.
The special case was argued a few days ago by Mr. Rolt and Mr. IL Giffard, who supported the validity of the appointment made by the deed of 1845. Mr. Hislop Clarke, for the defendant, contended that the appointment Wuas bad The Vice-Chancellor held thatthe appointment was invalid. It was then suggs ted by the counsel that the difficulty could be cured by webster, the surviving trustee under the will, appoint-mg a new trustee in the room of Tys, and that webster and such new trustee, or such new trustee and a trustee to be appointed by himself and Webster in the room of the latter retiring, could make a title. His Honour adopted this suggestion.
the case being agin mertioned,
His HoNouR said he was of opinion that Webster should appoint trustees in the room of Tyas and John Woodbead, the trustee who died in the testatores lifetime, and that such new trustee and Webster, or such new trastees and another to be appointed by them and Webster, in the room of Webster retiring, could make a good title.
His HONOUR intimated that he should not sit r Friday next.

These were two special ijry cases that occupied the Court the Whole of Tuesday.
The first was an action to recover damagee for assault and false imprisonment. The econd defendant, Mr. Meynell, paid into court the sum of 23L a satisfaction of the plain. tffS clainm The other defendant pleaded "' Not Guilty."
Mr. X Chambers, Q.C, and Mr. Lush were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. E. Jame% Q.C., and Mr. Hawkins for the defendants.
It appeared that the defendant Captain Faunce is the proprietor of a large quantity of property at the back of Kennington-common, which was formerly a farm and fields, but which bas of late yea been entirely covered with) houses, and the action arose out of a claim set up by him to a arivato right of way, which heasserted byiputting
pa ar. This, it appeared, was oonsidered a great. inconvenience by the inhabitants, and the plaintiff, who occupied a house in the neighbourhood, upon two occasions knocked the lock off and forced open the gate, and on the second oocmion he was taken into custody and de-I tained for some timeat the plioe-station, and the defendant. Mx. KeyneU subsequently signed the polioe-theet, in which thetplamntiff was charged with hainig committed damage, to e in question under the Mslicious Trespass Act. He afterwards appeared before a magistrte, hut Mr. Meynell did not come forward to press the charge, and it
consequentlydismissed, the present action being brought to recover damages for tne inconvenice the plantiff had sustained by being locked up in the police-station. The defence aet up was, that the plintif had been taken into custody by the polioe not only without the snction of Mr. Yeyneh, but against his stated that he wasonly induoed to ign the sheet to xsve the constable from getting into trouble. As regarded Captain Falince, it was admitted that he had no share whatever in the matter except as the owner of the property.
Mr. Justioe CaswimT, at the clos of the eae for t4e paintili; sad there was nothing to go to the jury against CaPtain Faunce
lb. JArEs addresed the jury on behalf of the other defendant, and submittd that the 4mm that bad been paid into court was ample compensation for the plaintiff under all the circumstanceg of the casem
The learned JUDGzhiaving ummed up, the jury, after a short deliberation, aid they were of opinion that 251. was a sufficient amount of 1amages, and a general verdict for both the defendants was consequently taken.
The second action was then tried, the object of it being on the part of the plaintiff to esablish the right of way that be had contended forin the former case.
The same learned Oounsel were engaged as in the former CASe.
good deal of evidence ws gone into to show that the road in question was private property, but, in the result, the learned Judge expressed his opinion that the plaintiff had failed to make out his case, and he wras consequently.
ELLT.S V. THE 5OUTI--WXSTERX RAILWA%.Y CO3EPAWY.
Mr. XL Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Hawkins wero counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. E. Jamnes, Q.C., and Mr. Lush. appeared for the oompany.
The plaintiff in this action is a farmer occupying land adjacent to the Guidford and Godalming PAilway, and the action was brought to recover the value of two colts that had strayed upon the line and-wrec ran over and killed by the train, in consequence, as was alleged, of the company not keeping a proper fence in accordance with the provWions of the Act of Parliament. An endeavour was made on the part of the plAintiff to show that at the place where the accident happened there was a public right of way for horses and pedestrians, but the case failed altogether so far as proving that it had been used by horses, and although it seemed to be madeout pretty clearly thAt theme was a footpath at the place in question, yet it appeared that the company had put up a gate and provided a lock and key for theuse of the owner of the land, and that if this gate bad been kept locked the accident could 2not have happened;. but it seemed that the. key had been lost, and that the gate had oonsoeuently not been properly secured.
Mr. Justice CXWSSWIn, without calling upon Mr. James to address the jury, said it appered to him that the plaintiff had not made out any negligence on the part of the railway company, and that, on the contrary, they really neme to have done all that oould be required of them for the prevention of accident, and that the matter would not have occerred if the gate had been kept locked as it ought to bave been.
The jury at once returned a verdict for the defendantL.
BsTrrAIN V. THE LONDON AND NORT-WESTERTN RAIL,
WAT.
This wa an action by a late clerk in the service of the defendants to recover damages for having been wrongfully disusised from his situation without suacient notice.
Mr. Joyce ewas counsel for the plintiff; Mr. E. James, Q.C., and Mr. Imsh appeared for the compny.
The plsintiff, it appeared, was first employed by the defendants in 1847, and he remainedin their serviceuntil18M5 when he received a month's notice of dismissal from his situation. He had been engaged originally at a yearly salary of 30G., which went on inoreasng umtil it amounted to .751, and he ws paid monthly. It was contended under these circumstanoes that a month's notice was insfficient, and that the plaintiff was entitled to damagog for saph wrongful dismissaL.
Mr. JAsx3, on behalf of the coapany, conteided that a month's notioe to a clerk under such eir cunitanes WAs a reasonable and proper notice, and that it was in accordanoe with the custom adopted by merchants and bankers, and also by other railwa7 companies. He observed that it would be a very senons thing if a railway company, finding that they had an incompetent person in their service, could not have the power of discharging him by gisiog him a month's notioe, and that they shoeld be compeUed to keep him for a longer period, nd by so doing possi6ly endanger the safety of the public.
Some witnesses were then called who gaTe evidence that it was the custom in banking establishmentg, although the clerks were engaged at a yearly salary and were in somue instanoe paid quarterly, to discharge them by givind a a months' notice, and some gentlemen oonnected with the Great Western and Great Northern Rallways were also examined, who stated that the same praotice was observed with the clerks in the employ of those companies. It p. peared, however, that in the case of these railways a printed toolk of reglaons w gvento every one who was egappd, and that thi book oontained tho rule that a month's notlce onl' of dimistal would be vTn.
The learned JuDas simply left it to the jury to Ms whether a month's notice ws a reasonable period, ane, after deliberating a short time, they sid they were of opinion that the plaintiff. should have had three months' notioe iustead of one, and they at the sme time said their verdict was founded upon the absence of a hook of regulaions such as appeared to be in use on other railway, and they recommended the company to use such a book in future, in order that their clerks mnlght be awrare of the eo,ndiffons under whice they entered their seorvice.
A verdict was then entered for the plaintiff-Damages

Mr. Serjeant Wells and Mr. Tozer wore counsel for the plantiff; Mr. Serjeant Byleg, Mr. O'Malloy, and Mr. Couch appeared for the defendant.
The parties in this cause are highlyrespectable merchants and inhabitants of this town, the defendant occupying a granary under COrpts Christi College, in a lane near the river Cam, called lAundress-lane, and situate betw6een Silver-street and Mill-lane, and the defendant owning and occuping all the rest of the property on both aides of the ame an, except a publichoua called the Anchor. The pleadings put in issue were the existence of a publie and private right of way through Laundress-lane for carnages sud horses, it being admttted that a public riht of way for foot pengers existed. On the part of the dofeudant, on wornm the affirmativerested, evidence was given of frequent and almost eonstant-use of the lane as a thoroughfare for horses and carts for the last 60 years, and though it was admitted that oocasionally a chaiu had been suslended across one of the entrances by the plaintiff and his predecessors, it was shown that the chain had always been unlocked and removed by the plaintis men whenever the defendant wished to pass Blght evidence of a documentary character was also given to show a right to the soil of the lane in Corpus Christi College, and the grant of a private way to their tenants; but no great stress was laid upon this point. With regard to the admitted right of footwvy, it was contended that at aU events the defendant ws entitled to a verdict, s the chaia was uspended from two posts, one of vhich was close to the buildings, while the other stood apart from those on the opposite aide so as to leave a space of 81 inches only. Through this space the learned counsel for the defendant insisted that no human being of a respectable size coduld possibly get, and he drew a lively picture of the effect which an attenpt to get through would orduce on the dons of the university, and also on their ladies, bedecked with crinoline and flounced as all ladies who love their lords now deem it necessary to be attired. On the part of the plaintiff, however, it was clearly shown that the chain had been suspen ed occasionally during each year, as far back as many ancient folks could recollect, In exercise of the rights claimed by the plaintiff and his predecemsors- and a document was put in which went to prove that even a public footway did not exist over the locus in 1797, for in that ycar Mfr. Hyde, who occupied the premises now held by the defendant, entered into a regular agreement with the then owner and the occupier of the vlauintift's premises, whereby, in consideration of 6d., the latter granted leave to the former to carry the body of his deceased wife through Iaundress-lane. Besides this, fre-
ent applicatious from the Paving Comramissioners to Mr. Eoster to *low the public traffic to pass through Laundresslane while Silrer-street or Mill-lane were undergoing repairs weptin; and it was proved that on the occasion' when the defendant was stopped by the chain, and vas obliged to knock it down in order to gain access to his.
rinar frdm Mill-lane, which was the trespass complined of mby the plaintiff in his declaration, the usual application' had not been made by the cormuisaioners, and the plaintiff bhad supmnded the chain In the exerciee and asertion of his birthright. With respect to the private rightiof way, it was contended that thare was not the slightest rtence for that ; and as to the aUeged obstruction of tho ootway, there was none whatover, as every one who wished to ss could easily step over the chain which was only lSiiiches or 2 feet from the ground, without any neceseity t&undergo the tortures so vividly depicted by the defendant's conissel in the atterupt to force a way

In consequence of the necewsary absenoe of the "1leaders" inbte Civi Court, this caue was conducted by the respective juniors, and lasted. till a late hour.
This wag an actioni inL which the plaintiff sought to recover damage from the defendant for an excessive distress, and also the value of tilgUe and crops and also of house fixtures reliquished by tho plaintiff to the defendant when the former gpve up to the latter a farm, of which he had been tenant under the defendant. At Mfichaclmas, 1853, the plaintiff took the Stuntney-hill-farm, near Ely, of the defendant for ayea at arentof 3151, and certain heades o
leasewereagroed toatdsigned bT them, which contained niostlipulation about the quantity of hay to be mown by the tenaut. The farm consitd of 1451 acres, of which 95 were, arb] and .50 gra%s and the, plaintiff, on going in, paid, the defendant the value of 46 acres of hay at the same valued price which Tlhe defendant had justhbeforetaken the hay of the same 46 wace fromi the outgoing tensast. At I4dy-day, 1855, the defendant gave thelplaintiff notice to quit,but just before harvesttime the parties met. and it wasagreed that the Ilaintiff should,. at the expiration of the currnt year, continue tenant of the farm for another yea at a rent of M50. According to the defendant, it was then also igreed. that a-new lease should be drawn up, that the clauses should be inx thLe discretion. of the defendant, and that the leedsL of it should be signed before or on the 29thi of September following, enL -which the defendant's tenancy would.- expire. The heads of a lease were accord'inly prepaired,; and ,pn the 28th of September the plaitif a ttended at, th ofice of the defendant's solicitor.

The plaintiff, however, insisted that the proposal for. a lease atid the interview at which the draught was read, ever to him and he was permitted to take it away were suhsequent to the 29th of September, and therefore after he had begunsa nw tenanc fora year at = rent- and that, as to mowing hay, his rigts were the same asw wLiea beD rA became tenant of thefarm, AtLady.day) IW5,.the-plaintiff received another notice to quit, onx which-he ileterasined to act ; and about the timue of the expiration of the year ofthe tenmany the parties, their " ve vAluersand lawyers, and an urn p r ominated by th valersentsetete amount to bepsaid by the defendant to the pl4intiff on the occwason of the latter going out.

This wa an action for a malicioos prosecution.
Mr. O'Brien appeared for the defendant, and Mr. Bittleston for the defondiat.
It appeared that in the early part of 1S55 the plaintiff, who had been amaster batcher, but was then very much redtoed in circumstances, and, indecd, in great distress, was taken iato the eervice -of the defendant, a butcher, near Stratford, and contisued there for 15 months. He was then dismissed for having said that a large amount of wages was dao to him. After his ismiseal he took out a summons in the County Court, in which he claimed 61. 5s. from the defendant, and that case was heard on the 27th of November, l556, when the plUintiff obtained a judgment for 31 se. As 9e left the court the bailiff said to him, "Well, vou're bet -" so which the defendant replied, "Yes; but I'll be -if I don't tbrow him into prison. Ho has robbed me, and I can prove it." Accordingly, that very afternoon he obtained a warrat againsttheplaintiffforembezzlement, Iad him locked up that night, and taken before a magistrate next day, by whom he was committed to take his trial at the assizes upon a charge of embezzling s. and obtaining 2s. 6d. by false pretences. He continued in prison -to the middle of December, when the winter assize was beld MtWarwick, and then the grand jury threw out the two bills which were preferred. For that prosecution the present action was commenced, and the above facts were proved in evidence. But on behalf of the defendant it was elicited that he had received information the night before the hear. Ing in the County Court that the plaintiff had received Is. and 2s 6d. from a person named Read, which, as the defendant swore, he had not paid over.
The jury found for the plaintiff-Damages 251
COOPER V. HAYWOOD. This was an action of slander.
Mr. MeLor, Q.C., and Mr. Bittleston apDeared for the 7laintiff; Mr. Serjeant Hayes and Mr. Brewer for the detendant.
The plaintiff is a jeweller at Birmingham. and the de. fendant a licensed victualler in the same town. In May, 1855, the latter purchased the lease. stock, and goodwill of the Spread Eagle of the then tenant,who was indebtedto the
laintiff in 2, .; and it was then arranged that Hudson's debt should be transferred to the defendant, who paid E001. down, and gave a mortgage of the premises and stock for the remainder. Subsequently an execution was -put in, and then the plaintiff paid out the sheriff, and paid off the arrears of rent and taxes, and took au absolute bil of sale of the lease, furniture, and stock. He entered into possession of the Spread Eagle, and had continued in nossession ever since, finding it impossible to realize his ebt by a sale. Shortly after he haa taken possession the defendant was arrested for debt, and petitioned the Insolvent Court. Upon his hearing the plaintiff was examined as a -witness, and gave evidence of the nature of the above transactions, and of the valuation of the stock which had been :mad3 by Messrs. Fallows and Smith, respectable auctioneers. HHe stated also that he considered that he had paid at least 501. more than the gooes were worth; and it appeared to be so by the valuation. The defendant was remanded for three months; and after his liberation he met in Birmingham a person named Archer, to whom he spoke about the plaintiff, saying that "he had taken false o%ths at War. wick ;' that " he had forged Fallows and Smith's valuation document ;" and that "he had robbed the defendant of 1,2001." This was the slander complained of, and the defence was a singular one. The pleas put upon the record were "Not Guilty," and a justification as to the charge of perjury. According to the evidence of the defendant he never uttered to Mr. Archer the words alleged, but he admitted that he had used similar language respecting the plaintiffto ether people on other occasions; and the defendant's brother stated that he had himeelf met Mr. Archer, and used very nearly the expressions which Mr. Archer attributed to the defendant.
T'he jury, however, found for the plaintiff-Damages, 301. CRos,%-o Cou=R.-(Beforc Air. Justice Wiouvsr&R).
Elizabeth M'Banning was charged with having assaulted and wounded Sarah, the wife of Joseph Callow, with intent to kill and murder her. The indictment also charged that she did the same with several other intents.
Mr. Flowers and Mr. Manson were instructed for the pro. aecution, and the prisoner was defended by Mr. Spooner.
The following is a summary of the facts of the case:About half-past 10 on the morning of the 9th of Febraary Mr. Joseph Callow, who is a riband manufacturer living at Barras-green, in Stoke, left his house for Coventry, where bis business is carried on. Mrs. Callow and the prisoner, an Irishwoman who had been only three months in Mr. Callow's service, were left alone in the house. On Mr. Callow's departure the prisoner went to Thomas Gaffey, an out-door servant of the CaUows, and asked him for the key of the front gate, telling him that her mistress's cousin and another gentleman were cOming to visit Mrs Callow, and that be was not to come near the house until after 12 o'clock. Having got the key the prisoner looked the front gate and the front and back doors. She then went upstairs to hermistress, who was dressing, fetched her warm water, conversed with her, and offered to fasten her dress. Upon Mrs. Callow turning her back to the prisoner for that purpose she received a severe blow upon her head, followed up by repeated blows inf'icted by the prisoner with an iron weight of seven pounds. Mrs. CaUow fell, and the prisoner let fall the weight and knelt on Mrs. Callow, -who struggled with her and contrived to thrust the iron weight under tbe bed beyond the reach of her antagonist. 'The prisoner then seized a poker and struck Mrs. Callow a -violent blow across the face, breakiDng two of her front teeth. After receiving many blows with this instrument and also with the tongs, Mrs. CaUow succeeded in thrusting these also under the bed, and she and her assailant continued to struggle, m Cgllow uttering frequent cries of " Murder !" and the servant endeavourin to thrust a dress boot into her mouth and to lay hold of h.Callow's tongue, in attempting which she was very severely bitten. The manservant Gaffey, who had before the attack been motioned away from the house by the prisoner, afterwards came near, and hearing Mrs. Calow's cry and a rumbling noise in the house endeavou to enter, and called out frequently, asking what was the matter. The
showed herself at the window, and told him that her mistress was in a fit, and that she could not leave her to let him in. He endeavoured to force an entrance with a gorsebook; he then informed some of the neighbours of the circumstances, and they also tried to gain admission, but in vain. Gaffey then resolved to ride to Coventry, which is distant about one mile and a-half from Stoke, and to inform Mr. Callow that eomething was wrong. This he did after some delay ia catching the pony, which was in a field, Upon receiving the information Mr. Callow ran home as rapidly as he could, and arrived at a critical moment. Meanwhile the struggle between the mistress and the servant continued, each holding the other by the hair, the prisoner sometimes beating Mrs. Callow on the face, sometimes bhting her, and sometimes endeavouring to force her eyes out with her fingers. She used the most abusive language throughout, and her expressions served to show the iutention of the assault. At one time she told Mrs. Callowthat she had as many lives as a cat, but she vwoeld have them out of her. Mrs. Callow told her tbat her husband would have her hung for this. Theprisoner answered, " Your husband will not complain again to me about my insulting you, for I shaU bo in Ireland on-Wednesday, and you shall never see your husband or mother again.I Mrs. Callow entreated the prisoner to sr her life. promising that if she would she s would let er bave 1001. aind suffer her to escape. She answered-"You shall never leave this room alive," and, seizing her by the hair of her head, said, " Look at the sun, for it is the last time that you wiU ever see it." Mrs. CaUow, much exlausted by the struggle, wbich lasted nearly two hours and a-half, clung to -the rail at the foot of the bed; the prisoner seized her by -the waist, and dragged both her and the bedstead towards 'the owindow, near which was a washstand, and taking -the ewer broke it over Mrs. Callow's head with a blow; then, grasping her hair, she struck her head violently against the wrall and beat her face with her fists. At this 'time Mr. Callow arrived, and, having found the front door fast and bis demand for admission neglected, he went to the back, where, being equally unsuccessful, he threatened to break in at the window. The prisoner then opened the door. She was covered with blood from head to foot. Her hair was-all dishevelled, and her hands bitten and bleeding. She said to ir. Callow, " There are two men now upstairs murdering my mistress." Mr. Callow rushed upsairs and found his wife upon the bed in an exhausted state, her Iaco frightfuUy disfigured, her dress torn and stained with her blood, With which the fioor also was covered in many places. He soon learnt from her that the prisoner washor assailant, and sent immediately for a oonstable, -who took her -into custody. The surgeon stated that Mr. -Callow had received five scap wounds of a dangerous character; that 'her -mouth was lacerated, and that she had -several wounds on other parts of I er body ; that her face was swollen and discoloured so that he could scarcely bave recognized her, and that she suffered from concussion of the brain. The only apparent motive for this violence was revenge, on account of a reprimand given to the prisoner by ler master for insolence to Mrs. Callow.
On benaft of the prisoner it wes urged that the assailt must have been unpremeditated ; thatit probably originated In a sudden quarrel, the rssulte of which Mrs. Callow Iiad exaggerated, and that it ws clear the prisoner had no-intention to murder, es sbe had not provided herself with any deadly weapon for that purpose; that, indeed, it 'was rather a fight hetween the servtant and the mistress, -the orig>in of wzhich wvas a mystery, than a maurderous assault bY the former, who affered almost as much as Mrs.
The jury almost, immediately returned a verdict of Guilv of the whole charge.
Sentence of death wes recosfied against the prisoner, who Wi be'transported for life.

CBRJLUAL COURT.-tBefore AMr. Jstice CROWIDEB.)
Thomas Gough, John Googh, -d James Gough were charged with enterinjg certain enclosed land at Kemberton, armed, in the night time, for the purpose of destroying game, on the 9th of October, 1856.
Hr. Corbett appeared for the prosecution ; Mr. J. Neale defended the prisoners.
It appeared that at about 12 o'clock on the night in question one o the gamekeepers of Mr. John flwkins saw four men setting nets in a field in the paish of eRemberton. He said the three prisoners were of the party, and that theb had with them a dog which the ganmekeeper cnewr helongee to Thos. Gough, the father of the other two prisoners. The prisoner Jamues G(gh caine towarde the ate where the gamekee,oer was watching, and on his mahng his sppearance he gave a signel to his companions by nocking two large stones together, and then ran away, kevg Dt throwa botkz thie stops at te Pmkeeper,
'ie gamedkeeper had a large- dog with bliwli6icY rn after the pnsoner, caught him~, and pinned him to the ground. The gamekeeper then went up to the other prisoners with a lorAed aix-bgTreled revolver in his hand, and fired it three times at the prisonerE' dog, ut without killing it. The two prisoners then iade their escape, and the garaekeeper went to the assistance of his dog, and they together captured James Gough and took him into custody. The next morning the elder prisoner went to the prosecutor's house to inquire for his son James, and was the same day given in custody. All the prisoners were known to the gamekeeper, and were clearly identified by him.
Mr. NxAjr, in his defence to the jury, said he thought it was very improbable that a father and brother would leave their companion to the tender mercies of the gamekeeper and his dog under such circumstances, and contended that the gamekeeper's evidence as to the identity of the two prisoners could not be depended on.
The jury found the prisoners all Guilty, but they recommended James Gough to mercy on account of his youth.
lIr. Justice CROWDER, after some strong observations on the offence of which the prisoners had been convicted, sentenced the elder prisoner, Thomas Gough, to nine months' imprisonment, John Gough to six months', and James to three months' imprisonment with hard labour.
Thomas Walmsley, aged 42, labourer, was charged with er.tering certain enclosed lanl at Wem, armed with a gun, for the purpose of destroying game, and assaulting and beating one Alfred Adams, a gamekeeper, on the 7th of December, 1856.
Mr. Powell appeared for the prosecution; Mr. J. Neale defended the prisoner.
It appeared that on the night in question Adaras and another keeper were watching some enclosed land at Wom, when they heard a bare cry, and going in the direction of the cry the 'amekeepers found themselves caught in a net. They accordingly waited there, and in a short time saw the prisoner stooping down at a hedge. Adams then went up to him, and the prisoner immediately struck him a violent blow on the head with the barfel of a double-barreUed gun. The keeper was stunned with the blow for a few seconds, but Wilson, the other keeper, coning to his assistance, he, with a large truncheon, attacked the prisoner and overcame him. A pheasant and a hare were found in the prisoner's pocket, and near him a bag containing a hare, 13 rabbits, and some nets. When taken to the police-station the prisoner, in mitigation, said he did not intend to strike Adams on the head, but on the mouth. The counsel for the prisoner advised him to retract his plea and to plead guilty but he positively refused to do so, on the ground that he had not struck the gamekeeper till he was assaulted, and he then used the gunbarrel in self-defence. Adams was cross-examined upon this point, but he persisted in his first statement. It appeared the gun was loaded, but it did not go off in the struggle, though, according to the prisoner's statement when taken into custody, it had caps on it, which got knocked off.
The jury found the prisoner Guilty.
Mr. Justice CROiDwR sentenced the prisoner to 18 months' imprisonment withhard labour.
John ToUy, aged 30, letter-carrier, pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of stealing a post-letter, containing a half-sovereign, at Cleobury Mortimer, on the 6th of March, 1856.
Mr. Justice CROWDEaR sentenoed the prisoner to four years' penal servitude.
John Pritchard, aged 50, labourer, Wiliam Wesley, aged 29, tailor, John Reeves, aged 52, and John Ramsden, aged 35, labourer, were charged with entering certain enclosed land at Child's Ercall, at night, armed, for the purpose of taking game, on the 10th of January, 1857.
Mr. scotland appeared for the prosecution * Mr. J. Neale was counsel for the prisoners.
By the advice of their counsel the prisoners all pleaded itGuilty."l
They were then charged upon an indictment with shooting at one of the gamekeepers, with intent to prevent their lawful apprehension and to do grievous bodily harm. To this they pleaded " Not Guilty."
Mr. SCOTLAD said, there was some doubt in this case whether the shots, which had hit the gamekeeperin thelegs, were not intended for the dog which the gamekeeper had with him. Under those circumstances, he would offer no evidence on this charge.
Mr. Justice OCOwnDEB said that, if there was any doubt upon that point, it would be the duty of the jury to find the prisoners not guilty.
This was done accordingly.
Ris Lo)Rms'p sentenced the prisoners to be each impnsoned with hard labour for two years.
John Davis, aged 23, labourer, John Price, aged 43, and John Russell, 32, labourer, were charged with entering certain enclosed land at Atcham, armed, in the nighttime, for the purpose of taking game, on the 12th of January, 1857.
Mr. Boughey appeared for the prosecution; Mr. J. Neale defended the prisoners
It appeared that on the night in question five keepers in the service of Mr. Burton, of Lopenor, were out watchin
and at 3 o'clock in the morning they heard the report of a gun in the direction of Emstrey-rough. They went towards the spot, and saw three men, the prisoners, coming from a cover, across Mr. Linnell's field. The prisoner Price stepped forward, and held a formidable bludgeon over one of the keepers' heads* and the prisoner Davis, who had a gun, cocked it and pomnted it at one of the gamekeepers, and then punched him with the muzzle in his side. He also used the butt end of the gun against one of the other gamekeepers. It was afterwards discovered that the gun was loaded, but it had no cap on it. The prisoners were all taken on the spot, and as many as 13 snares were found, some upon the prisoners.
The jury found allthe prisoners Guity.
Mr. Justice CRoWDnR sentenced the prisoners to be Inprisoned for 18 months, with hardlabour.
The trial of these 11 prisoners for night poaching seemed to excite great interest among the country gentlemen and magistrates, who crowded the court in great numbers.
The buness of the assizes was brought to a close at 4 o'clock.
Court Of Bankruptcy, March 25.
COUBT OF BANKRUPTCY, MaIch 25.
IN RE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK
(Before Jfr. Comrnitsioner HOLROYD.)
This was a meeting for the further examination of Mr. Edward Esdaile, the late Governor of the Bank.
Mr. Linklater appeared for the assignees; Mr. Venning for Mr. Esdaile; Mr. Ellis watched the case on behalf of the representatives of the late Mr. Charles Walton.
Mr. LINKLTErt, before proceeding with Mr. Esdaile's examination, applied to the Commissioner for the appointL ment of a further dividend sitting in this matter. He stated that there was now in hand sufficient to pay a further dividend of 2s. 6d., or at least 2s., in the pound. The assignees were very desirous that an early sitting should be appointed. Mr. Lbiklaterthenremarkedthatthegeneral compromisewith the shareholders would, ia all probability, be delayed in consequence of Parliament having risen so unexpectedly, but that the assignees were proceeding with the composition, and it was all-important that the creditors who had not already done so should signify their acquiescence as soon as possible.
The 1rth of April next was accordingly appointed for the dividend sitting.
Mr. ITKLATER said, it was due to Mr. Paddison to state that he had nothing to do with the securities taken from mr. Walton, and those taken from Mr. Huimphrey Brown were taken with the perfect knowledge, on the part of the directors, of the irregularity of such securities.
The COssurISIONEn..-It is not a common practice with bankers to take such securities.
Mr. Vz_NNiN.-Among merchants I am told it is exceedingly common to do this thing upon honour.
Mr. L5N-LATE.-" More honoured in the breach than in the observance."
Mr. LnzKLATER stated he had been asked by Mr. Goddard, a profewsional man, a surgeon, to mention publicly that he is not the Mr. Goddard who becarae bankrupt by haig taken shares in the Royal British Bank.
Mr. Paddison stated, as to Mr. Humphrey Brown's securities, that he did advise the directors most explicitly abott the consequence of the non-registration of the ships, pointing out that the consequence would be that, for want of registration, it would certainly be in the power of Mr. Humphrey Brown, if he thought proper and choseto do so, either to seU or to mortgage the ships and to destroy the bank securities.
Mr. Paddison further said, respecting the statement he had made as to the discussion about clause 71, at the instance of ME Elumphrey Brown, in Mfarch or April, 1855, that all the directors present at that mee ing appeared tobe opposed to Mr. Humphrey Brown's suggestion.
Mr. Esdaile here said :-With reference to my evidence given at the last examination on the subject of htr. Walton's account, I find that in consequence of Mr. Linklater having brought to my mind circumstances which showed that X knew the state of that account before I took the chair in February, 1855, I was led to infer that I must have had access to the green ledger before that date, contrary to my first impression; but, from facts of which Mr. Paddison has reminded me I beleve I was right originaUy, and that I must have come at a knowledge of that account from some other source, and not from that book (probably from Mr. Cameron's statement of it). As to the case of Mr. Frederick Clark, and the advice given by the Attorney-General I wish to state that I am not aware that there was anything in that case which the bank w-onld have been mad to expose, except the fact that it had a serious lock-up of capital in a coUiery in Wales, and this, I suppo se, was the meaning of the Attorney-Generaf in his advice to us. With respect to the general conduct of myself and ray brother directors, which Mr. LiBklater has so *sverely.arraigned, it is only fair to state that, except those ditectors who were debtors to the bank, and who were but four in number out of 22, we had no personal interests in carrying on the bank. For myself,I swear I zvas actuated by a sincere desire to do the beet for the shaaeholders. We were not taking money from the bank, hut were labouring incesEantly to retrieve its affairs. After I beeame eovernor=
* Iyseir zoere ailsmosc daily and almost all day long; and, if the attempt to carry on the ba:k shou:d now appear absurd, it i6 surely due to us that the pubWic aheald consider that tho present state of aflasrs was not presant to our Ininds. lhe disasters which have occurre came ron us by degrees, and the large deficiency nowshownby Mr. t.olemau is to a considerable extent due to the less whis always attends realization in bankruptcy. To the last we wei e led to suppose that there were many chances of extrication, be. fore us; that the Welsh works would have been leased e s royalty or taken up by a public companTv, so as to cover'trat outlay. The loss by Mr. Brown wo dx& not suxpose coaid be a heavy one, his securities having oen valued a 60,000l
We were, mnoreover, in treaty wilbk another banking establishment, which was not unwillbg to treat with us on the footing of giving us a JMge capital sum for the goodwiU of the business we had acquired at so small cost, subject, of course, to investigation. We alio looked for. ward to strengthening the bank by aiditional capital and by more ifuential directors ; nor did Fe conAider it improbable
that,under our altered circumstances and improved position, i Joite esa4ef capital And e-terpr* might be induced to ally
ith-etil1vei wileth le'baik, who 'ith Slnowledge 6! iIC bhrdens, would likeise apprte, and beinJfuenoe. by, Its cvacityof profitable development. If our hopes in snyof tieso respects had been realized the failure of the bank would have been averted. I am not anxious to show that wewere rihtin the course we took. We may have beea too often injudicious in our conduct under the dimculties of our position; but I am most anxious that it should appear t*at our motives were correct, and that we had no other aim than to do our beat in the circumstances in which we were placed. It i in this way that the matters upon which
fr. iAnklater has so strongly adverted are to be explained. When we presented the half-yearly account, when we declared dividends, when we called in orinvited shareholders to join us, with further caital, ordidany of the other acts which have been censured, we were governed by the same motive. So long as the directors tbought that the circumstances were not such as to warrant them in closing the bank, so long it vas absolutely necessary-as every man of basinesswill know-to pay interest on the capital, and to uphold, as we endeavoured todo, the credit of the bank with the public. I have been much pressed as to my opinion of the insolvency of the bank at different periods. I think it mnst be apparent to everybody that up to August, 1854, when I took up 10 of the new shares, I could not have had any fear as to its stability and ultimate success, and, afterwards, surely my continued con nexion wth it is the best evidence of the reliance I placed on the future. I joined the bank in its earliest stage with upright intentions; I have remained by it through its troubled career; and I have sunk with it, thank God, with clean hands (hisses and other marks of disapprobation), nd a conscience which e.xonerates me from one act of intentional wrong.
3Mr. IKALUE.-Mr. Esdaile is welcome to the benefit of his explanation.
Mr. Esdaile was then examined by Mr. LL%T'ILATER s ollows --The promissory note for 18,457t, dated the 28th of January, 1854, payable three months after date, produced, signed by Messrs. M'Leard, Chandler, John Banng, J. C. Thompson, and Hunmphrey Brown, is signed by me. I and three of those persons were directors of the bank. Mr. Chandler was the auditor. Mr. Thompson was the engineer of the Wandle Waterworks Company. That note was given for money borrowed by me and my co-directors, for the Wandle Waterworks Company, of the Royal British Bank. That note was repaid with interest. I think there is no balance due upon it. I can have no conception that there is upwards of 2,0001. due upon it. The Wandle Waterworks Company had started the thing, I think, in 1852. It must have been that I and my co-directors borrowed in 1852 of the Royal British Bank 15,6!551. for the Wandle Waterworks Company, I was, in 1852, a director of the Wandle Waterwrorlcs Company. The money borrowed of the Royal British Bank was for that company. It was upon amnple security, and wras repaid with interest. If I am to answer the question as to wnhether or not the Wandle Waterw orks Company went to Parlament in 1852 or 1853 for an Act, I admit they did. The Bill was opposed.
3Mr. VENSIOIG suomitted that there was no reason why the affairs of the Wandle Waterworks Company should be paraded before the public.
The CornassiloNER.-Your anxiety givesthe appearance that there is something in it.
Mr. LL-SlATE&-Mr. Venning is your brother-in-law, I believe, Mr. Esdaile?
Mr. VmmcG.-He is.
Mr. LU AmATE -That may account in some measure for the interruption.
Examination continued.-I do not know how long that note for 15,6001. remained unpaid. When it was taken up it was paid with interest. I am not quite sure wbether a portion of that did not remain upon the account, and was incorporated in the 18,0001. in the previous bil. I presume that note was unpaid on the 3d of January, 1854. It was afterwards paid with interest, and the bank ran no risk in that advance. I cannot answer the question as to whether the only security the bank had for the advance of 15,6651. was my signature to the petition to the Court of Chancery for a return of the money in case the Bil was thrown out. The bank received the like security for the note for 18,0001. I have not been connected with any companies that I know of that made use of the funds of the Royal British Bank. I was not a member of the Waterproof Brick and Tile Company. My name was put to the paper produced without my authority. I was acquainted with the Royal Australian Gold Company. I was connected with another company which was based upon that. The Royal British Bank were theirbankers, if it says so there. That company became defunct. The Wan(le Waterworks Company also became defunct. I have heara of the Irish Peat Company, but I have had nothing to do with it. I have not heard until this time of the Home and Colonial Improvement Company. Mr. Gwynne was a director of the Royal British Bank. I do not know that he was a director of any other company. I believe that Mr. Cameron did at one time make a complaint that there were so many of these companies with which the Royal British Bank was connected. lie never complained very much that the parlour of the bank was used by the directors of these companies. I eve had an accoutnt myself with the bank. Mtypartner, Mr
MIargrsve, however, had a cash credit account withs the. Royal British Bank to the amount of 5,000G The balance owing by Mr. a rgrave to the amount of 4,0001 has been paid since the bankruptcy.
MIr. Liexnsirxi.-I do not wish to mention the name nowv, but did you in January, 1854, obtain for a brother-in. law ofysonras acash credit for 1,000C.
Mr. B.sdaile.-Yes, I did.
Mr. VE-Gncura.-I may state, that brother-in-law is not myself. I have no donbt we shall have the family here; hult it is not me on this occasion.
MIr. Esdaile here detailed the circumstances connected with that advance.
Mr. LlicLATm-In what amount did you find that Mr. Walton was indebted to the bank on the 1st of February, 1855.-It was 46,6971. upon discount account. Takinz the discount and current accouts at that date there would be due from Walton to the bank upwards of 52,0001. The only security the bank held for that debt was the deposit of 52,t was the moere deposit of the mortgage on the Hmelen Linda yi the Hero, Magdalena, Ocean Wave, Hornet, James dihb, and William Stevenson, and the commercial names attached to the bil, constitutingtbe discount accoun
I think it must have been that in the month of January, 1S55, we learnt that there was considerable apprehension with reference to the security held by the bank from Mr. Walton in the shape of that commercial paper. The letter produced from Charles Walton to Hugh Innes Cameron, the* genernl manager of the Royal British Bank, is signed by A, r. Walton.
Mr. ELLS objected to the reading of the letter; but The Co3aussioXER overruled his objection.
Mr. L;KLATEm read the letter, which was as follows - " Privet." Tuble-hi JaD. 55, 1554,
(Should be 1SSS)
Dear Sir,-I was much surrlised to hear from my son that you re fused todiScount anybUlzlfor us. Ibegtoteil yonplainlythat it IS a&W4ntely necessary that you should continue to discount such bils as we Yseeive from pereons who owe us the money, not only to pFrvent us stopping payment, but for the safety of the bank itself, which must fall if the governor and two ot the directors fail, with whom wil Ba sno, six or seven other persons onmnected with the bank. You are not acting the part of a prudent manof business in thus stopping us in our energetic caurse of gradually liquidating and withdrawing the bils from the bank, which cannot PAdbly be done without us having guDident time to realize our assets. Perhaps you are not aware that we have already paid this mouth bete eon £30tlOand £40,lOObDlasbeld by thebank, andbetween thisandMondzyshaLU payabout£2OODmore, thu, gradually but continuaUy lessening the amount of paper in the bank's hands (I do not reckon wbat has been done for Air.

"Hush Innes Cameron, Eeq. Geuerl Manager of
the Royal Britiah sank."
Examination continued.-At tho time that letter was written the large amount owing from the manager, Mr. Cameron, to the hank, must have been discovered. It ap. pears there as a fact that during the absence of the general manager I discounted for Mr. Charles Walton his?draughs upn Mr. Cochrane for the 7001. on the 17th of March,
I-5. It i Charles Walton's discount account., That muss be subject to explanation. I find two names in the book produced ono beginning with the initial G, the other with the initial 8, two persons who were said to be so much in-
volved with Mr. IWalton at the time. After that time other discounts were made on bills accepted by the samo parties to the amoant of thousands. But that was upon Mr. Walton'sdeclaration as to the ship securities upon which hehadgranted advsncestothoseparties. The hankpartedwith their own moneys on imerely getting the bills.together, with the security of Mr. Walton's name. The balance upon the average on Mr. Walton's discount account with the bank in 1855 was between 20,0001. and 30,0001., but it was larger40,0001., then 17,0,0, then 16.000, and finally it was ex. tinguished. I have heard Mr. Cochrane's name mentioned 5n Ar. Walton's letter, and I see that in an early letter in 1'ecember Mr. Walton alludesfo Hr. Ccchranes difficultieS
Mr. Cochrane must have. volved him very much. The Boy, I British Bank in that very month of December granted a cred.;t to Mr. Cochrane of 6,0001 upon the security of certain bonds at Liverpool. -Mr. Cochrane was at
that tin a a director of the hank. Thera were four bouts givenl, amounting together to that sum. Mir. Cochra. Re thereupon had liberty to drarw npon the funds of tile bank t 9 the amount of S,O001.,-a privil'ee of which I have no 4ouL t he soon availed bimself. (LawngTter.) The hIll,tgte.s ,osie r,.3 the bonds of 1,COOI, were Eii21 Xa i
ess, of Liverpool. I do not kno wwhen they failed. Thedeed of oompodition-is dated very soon after the transaction. Mr. Oxley is one of the sureties for another 1,0001. He filed about the same timne. When thee two sumeties bad gone for 2,0004. we asked hint to show us a statement of his account. He had no security to give us at that time. His account increased after I became governor, on the 1st of February, 1855, from 5.0001. to 10,060I.; upon the strength of certain credits which he said were either in his hands or coming into his hands. (lAughter.) I will say what they were, if youwill allowv ne.
Mr. LINmxT1ArT-If yon will do me the favour to reserve your explanation until I have pat one or two questions with regard to the account I shall be obliged. I observe that on the 5th of February the amount of 5,500, is transferred from the drawing account to the discount ccount.
Mr. Esdaile.-I do not know.
Just see whether you do not find from February 5, 1855, although Mr. Cochrane was in that hopeless state that yow have told us, the account goes on, and in June, 1855, while you are governor, the amount owing by lfr. Cochrane upon that discount accountwas 1l,231L -Yes. (Sensation.)
For that the bank held no security ?
Mr. Esdaile.-No tangible security. (Laughter.) But I have an explanation to make upon that. (Renewed laughter.)
Certainly; and it so continued, and the amount now owing by lr. Cochrane to the bank is somewhere about 10,000!.?
Mr. Esdaile.-Ia it so much as that? 10,427! 2s. 8d. ?
lb. Esdaile.-Whatever the books say, of course, I admit. Mr. LrimrxTErx-Now any explanation you like.
Mr. Esdsile.-At the time the 5,000! bonds were given he put a list before us of certain liabilities of his which were abolt to mature, and which those bonds would cover. At that time of course the bank was impressed with the stability of those names. (A laugh.) The bank had no reason to doubt the stability of Messrs. Kirk aud Furness, or Mr. Oxlqy; but subsequent to that, when Cochrane's embarrassments became rnore apparent, and the pressure upon him became more severe, wo called upon him to make a general statement of his affairs in oar hands, and he showed us that there were bills, acceptances of his own, to the extent of 5,900!. maturing; that he was under obliga. tion to meet demands, part of which would be compromised to the extent of 1,500!. or more, and at that timie there existed an over-draught upon the account-mv memorandum states of 1,8001.,-making together* 9,2004, against which he placed these credits. You asked me why we let him go on. He said there were the proceeds of cargoes of wood in his brokers' hands to the amount of 5,9951.; that there was due from the Halifax house with which he had commercial transracons 4,0001.; that he held shares in the bank, and other securities, together equal to 2,0001., that he had cash at this time at the London and Joint-Stock, and at oar bank, 800!., in all, 16,3901., having actually given us a return of five large debts owing to him from estates wvhich had then become bankrupt, including Oxley's failure, andKirk and Famrness, togetheramoanting to about 7,0001., the dividends upon which he reckoned to be quite equal to 2,2001 or thereabouts, and appearing in the schedule of credits to the extent of 18,5271. Besides that 18,000! those 5,0001. of the Liverpool bonds were running, so that it did appear, unless there was some great fallacy in the figares, that the bank was covered with a very large marginby 5,2771. The doubtful figures which he reported to us in these credits were the 5,290! given in as the balance of proceeds of the cargoes of wood. He said brokers had charged for interest upon advances and other charges, such as dockage expenses, which would very much impair that figure, but he said in his opinion there must be between 2,000!. and 3,000!. coming to him. That would still have left a large margin to cover these advances, and under those circumstances, not wishing to expose the bank to the unpleasantness of the failure, and the unneces. sary failure, as we believed, of one of our number, the bank considered and allowed him to act upon the account to a certain extent, always feeling that they had a margin of many thousands in their favour. If you ask me whether these securities were then of a tangible character, such as we could put our hands upon, I should say they were not, because the dividends on the bankrapf s estates were coming in to the extent of 2,0001. Hisdividendofthelialifax house had not been reaized. His bank stock remained, and though now you may say we had no right to look upon it as a ecurity, we did look upon it as a security. Tbat is my general answer to the question. How could I, in my poition, see the account accruing from the date I took the chi?My answer is that we believed the bank was amply secured by the credits he showed in the statement of his affairs.
Mr. LRNMATMR.-Why delude yourself with such lan. guage as " having security 2" Does it amount to more than this-that Mr. Cochrane represented himself to be a solvent mnan ?
3ir. Esdaile.-Yes, very far above insolvent. They held among other securities a number of shares in the bank. (Laughter.) The bank at that time began to experience inconvenience. This was in Sep,ember, 1855. Their funds were becoming very short. They relaxed their discounts, hut he was not aware whether the discounts to the directors were restricted.
A letter was here produced from Mr. I D. Macleod, an officer of the bank, as addressed to Mr. Cameron. It commenced "Dear Mr.planager," and acknowledged the receipt of a haunch of venison, which had arrived safely. It also set forth tbat he could, make up 25,0001., but that that was their last shot (a laugh), and that there was no prospect of meeting their payments on the 13th. The manager was much wanted again at the helm.
It appeared from the forther examination of Mr. lsdailo that, notwithstanding the board had considerable apprehen. sions in October, 1855, of being able to go on, they issued a circular to the shareholders stating their intention of opening a branch in Holborn and adding 2,000 to the existing number of sbares. By issuing the shares they were endea. vouring to do all they could to uphold the bank. (Laughter.) The last report to the shareholders was issued without a signature. Did not know who drew the report. le must have had a hand in it. Mr. Cameron's absence from the general meeting on the 1st of August last was, no doubt, at the instance or the board of directors. (Sensation.) He had written offering to come. The bank paid him his salary up to the 1st of September, 1856, and then let him go before the general meeting of the 1st of August. He never treated the green ledger as a mysterious book; all he said was that he was not cognizant of it. He durst say he heard it stated that Cameron kept that book from the directors, and that he alone had the key, but be might have heard that statement made by Ogren, and not contradicted it. The book could not have been kept concealed by Cameron, because it was open to observation, Would not like to swear that ho did not know before he came to the chair that Cameron had a discount account at the bank. Mr. Cameron might have disconnted his own bis.
Mr. LumaAmT-Did you alow him to keep the accounts as he pleased?
Mb. Esdaile.-He was the supreme executive of the bank.
Mr. LINRLATER.-Supreme ! I thought you were the governor ?
Mr. Esdaile.-I am talking as executive. (Laughter.)
Mr. LjXLATL'.-You do not mean to say he was there foruse, and you for ornament? (Laughter.)
Mr. Esdaile.-It was very much the case. (Renewed laugh. ter.) On the 31 stof SIay,1856, x= ialcourt washdd, whenit was determined " that Hugh Innes Cameron be not continued as general manager beyond the Ist of September, 1856."' It would have been an awkward circumstance to nention in the report that he had been "dismissed," and it will be found there that Cameron had "resigned." In May, 1856, the Rev. J. H. Gossett, a shareholder, required the bank to find a purchaser for his shares, he being uneasy in consequence of a communication from an unknown correspondent. The bank replied that he should put them ia the hands of his brokers. Mr. Gossett did so, but, being unable to find a purchaser, threatened to call a meeting of shareholders and depositors. The directors thereupon gave directions that the shares should be purchased. That would be with the bank moneys. There was no entry in the books of this transaction. Oh, no. (A laugh.) Thebrokerwasmy brother-in-law, and I recom. mended him not to put in his name as the transferee of the shares. During the whole period of the bank's career a sum of 4,000!. odd only was carried to the bad debt fund, whereas the bad debts exceeded 1l0,000!., debts which were ascer. tained to be bad appeared, nutwithstanding, -hrongh subsequent half-yearly accounts as as5ets.
A report had been issued in which it vas statedthat " the contributions of innumerable smal! rills gradually swellin into a mighty head 3dg~ht be difilii,d so as to irrigate and fructify thc surrocuiding r,oc. and be a blessing to the givers and receivers." ~ nis simile applied to the blessings to b dervedfrom~ii Royl Bt,,~l Bnk.(LAaughter.) That report concluded- .(ogtL
"That the benefits of the inrtitution to t&e community would as much exceed those of even savings-bak Mas did the gaing of the good and faithful uservant those of him who kept his pound kaid up in a napl:in."
(Loud laughter.)
On further examination Mx. Esdailo said,-It was true, most true, that the best principles were of little avail unless they were practically, intelligently, and faithfully acted on; these were the professions of 1849. It was intendod that the bank should commience with a capital of 5'00,000
but as the public would not respond they reduceA
ne caPI to IO lW,ODUC. Tney made every effort to get out the shares. The Parliamentary expenses were 9,000., including 1,1001. paid to the directors. He (Mr. Esdaile) had seen the bank through all its hopes and all its difficultise-the difficulties first and the hopes after. A Mr. Meunzies was the secretary of the bank at the commencements. He did not know then that he was at that time in Whitecross-street. (JAughter). Did not know of Mr. M1'Gregor's arrangemenr with the proprietor of the HEll of Commerce to give him 500!. if he got the
bank to purchase the building. He remembered Men-
zles going to the north withAlderman Kennedy tolook after shareholders; they got plenty of promises; the Newcastle people got their money bacli. A letter was reed from Menzies to Mullens, the then solicitor of the bank, dated Burden's Hotel, Whitecross.street, June 21, 1849, requesting Mullens to obtain his release, that he might be enabled to attend the next board meeting, and put all things right,
Mr. IaNyKLATLER hero read a statement of the directors sent out to the world:-
"T nat the Royal Britigh Bank being incorporated by Royal charter, it possessed a privlege of doing local buginess equsl toany bank except
the sank of England. The Lords of ner MajeWs Privy Counci of Trade had alreadY approved of the deed of constittuton by Increasing the Capita as the nsture of the bueinos mn1ght requfre."
(Sensation).
Mr. Menzies was described as "John Menzies, Esq., Secretary "intbereport. (Laughter.) Mr. John M'Gregor is indebted to the bank about 7,0004 (Mark of disapprobation.)

The Case Of Fratricide At Maidstone.-The
T|' CASE oF FRATiClmDE AT XAiIoro.-Tha inquest on the body of Thomas Edwards, tho young man. who was murdered on Wedneday night, the 18th inst., in. Wheeler-street, Maidstone, by his brother, George Ed. wards, was resumed yesterday (Wednesday) afternoon, be. foreer. EKiping, borough coroner. The only additiona! evidenec adduced was the followig:-Mrs. Mary Ann Edwards, the mother of the deceased, stated that on Wednesdiy, the day of the murder, she had missed the axe with. which the crime was committed from its customary place in the cellar, and asked her son George, the accused, wihere it; was. His reply was that perhaps his father had put it up
stairs, and George then went up and brought it down in his. hand. She afterwards ascertained tbat her husband had not had it upstairs for more than a week past She took it; down with her into the cellar, used it, and left it there. She had never missed it before, and was in the habit of choppinR woodwithitevery day. The abovetestimony was corroborate, by David Edwards, the father, who had never known Georgee to take the axe up stairs before. ]?olice.constable Leney deposed that, on beeng caled into Edwards's house on ther
ightof the murder, he sarched the oedroom, nd beneatb the bed, on the sidctne a thendow, here the younger brother (George) usually elept, he found the axe, wrappe in a dirty shirt and pair of stock-ings, and covered with wvet; blood *nd human halr. The coroner having summed n the wbhole of the testimony, the jury returned a vrdi of "Wilfle Murder" against George Edwards, who * 1 present in Maidstone Gaol, under the wvarrant issued bl3he magistrates for his apprehension. The father of the XBUng men was formerly a small farmer at Coxheath, in the neighbourhood of Masidstoue, but within the last twvo or threw years has fallen into distressed circumstances, so that ha, and his children have been compelled to seek their maintenance in the position of labourers,-a condition which George, the acused in this case, seems to have been exceedingly reluctant to assume. The final examination of the prisoner before the magistrates wldl not take place tiR Tuesday next, having been djourned over the borough election. The prisoner, since he has been in continement, appears to manifest the greatest indifference to the conse-
ct, and prsists in saying that he was at oxle les off, hnthe murder took place, with a young woman, wfhvm he~ reiusce to insgc.
