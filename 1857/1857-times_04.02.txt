THE PERSIAN WAR.
We take the following description of the brilliant affair under General Outram near Bushire from the Bombay Telegraph of March 5, which reached us by -the Overland Mail at a late hour this morning. Further intelligence will be published in our Second Edition:-
" The Victoria, which arrived from the Gulf on Monday afternoon, brought intelligence of a rather, Emart engagement having been fought between the British and Persian troops at a place called Kooshab on the 8th ult. Sir James Outram, learning bat a large body of Persians, under the command of Soojsh-ool-Moolk in person, was hovering around Bushire, resolved at once to brine matters to an isaue. The troops, consiMing of the 3d Cavalry, the Poonah Horse, the 64th Foot, the 2d European Light Infantry, the 78th Highlanders, the Sappem and Miners, the 20th Native Infantry, the 4th Rifles, the 26th Native Infantry, the Beloochees, 3dTroop Horse Artillery, 3d and 5th Light Field Batteries-numbering in all 419 sabres, 2,212 European Infantry, 2,022 Native Infantry, and 18 guns, marched from Bushire cn the evening of the 3d of February. They were without tents or extra clothing of any sort; (ach man carried his greatcoat, blanket, and two days' cooked provisions. After a march of 46 miles in 41 hours, during which they were exposed to the worst of weather, cold nights and deluging storms of rain, they reached the enemy's intrenched position on the morningof the 5th, but found it abandoned. The enemy on hearing of our approach had evacuated their intrenchments so precipitately that their tents and camp equipage and ordnance magazine were abandoned; the former were being rapidly carried off by the village plunderers operating for some hours before we arrived. Every exertion was made to intercept the retreat of some bodies of the enemy's cavalry still in sight, and some little akirnishing with a few horsemen took place, but eventualy they all made off. After occupying for two days the position the enemy had evacuated, and hearing that they had suceeded in getting the guns which they carried away into the difcult pass of Mhak, thetroopa commenced their return march on the night of the 7th, carrying awaythe large stores of flour, rice, and grain which the Persian Government had collected for their army, and destroying their magazine, found to contain about 36,0001b. of powder, with smallarm ammunition, and a vast quantity of shot and shell, thereby crippling the future operations of their army; some of the guns are supposed to have been cast into wells, and, as their wheels fell into our hands, cannot again be used. At midnight an attack was made upon the rearguard by the enemy's horse, and parties threatened the line of march on everyside; the troops were halted, and so formed as to protect the baggage and resist the horsemen in whatever direction they might attempt o charge. Before this was quite completed four of ihe enemy's guns of heavy metal were opened upon the force, but the darknees of the night prevented any steps being taken to capture them. At break of day the Persian force, amounting to between 5,000 and 6,000 men, with five guns, was discovered on our left rear, north-east of our line of march. The cavalry and artillery imnmediately moved rapidly to the attack, supported by two lines of infantry, a third protecting the baggage. The fire of artilery was most exceUent and did great execution, the cavalry also twice charged with great gallantry and success-indeed, upon these two arms fell the whole brunt of the action, as the enemy moved away too rapidly for the infantry to overtake them. By 10 o'clock the defeat of the Persians was complete. Two guns were captured, the gun ammaunition, laden upon mules, fell into our hands, and at least 700 men lay dead upon the field. The wounded, the number of whom must have been considerable, had been carried away, the remainder fled in a disorganized state, generally throwing away their arms, which strewed the field in vast numbers, and nothing but the paucity of our cavalry prevented their total destruction and the capture of the remaining guns. The troops bivouacked for the day close to the battlefield, and at night accomplished a march of 20 miles over a country rendered almost impassable by the heavy rain which fell incessantly. After a rest of six hours the greater portion of the infantry continued their march to Bushire, which they reached before midni'ght on the 9th of February, thus performing another harassing march of 44 miles under incessant ram, besides fighting and defeating the enemy during its progress, within a short period of 50 hours. The cavalry and artillery, with an infantry escort, reached camp on the morning of the 10th ult. The result is most satisfactory, and will, General Outram thinks, have a very beneficial effect on our future operations in Persia. We subjoin the despatches -

"Camp near Bushire, Feb. 10.
"Sir,-I have the honour to report for your Excellency's information that the Persian Expeditionary Force obtained a signal victory over the Persian army commanded by Shooja-ool-Moolk in person on the 8th inst.
" 2. The enemy's loss in killed and wounded must have been very great. It is impossible to compute the amount, but from the number of bodies which strewed the ground of contest, extending several miles, I should say that full 700 must have falen. Two brass 9-pounder guns, with their carrages and horses, eight mules, laden with ammunition, and several hundred stand of arms were taken; and the Persian Commander-in-Chief, with the remainder of his army, only escaped annihilation owing to the numerical weakness of our cavalry.
" 3. The loss on our side is, I am happy to say, comparatively small, attributable, I am inclined to believe, to the rapid advance of our artillery and cavalry, and the welldirected fire of the former, which almost paralyzed the Persians from the commencement. I have, however, t, regret the loss of Lieutenant Frankland, 2d European Regiment, who was acting as Brigade-Major of Cavalry, and was killed in the first cavalry charge; Captain Forbes, also, who commanded and most gallantly led the 3d Cavalry, and.LieutenantGreentree, 64th Foot, were severely
wounded.
" 4. Returns of the killed and wounded, and also of the ordnance stores taken, are annexed.
" 5. I myself had very little to do with the action, being stfuned by my horse falling with me at the commencement of the contest, and recovering only in time to resume my
placo at the head of the army shortly before the close of this action.
" 6. To Major-General Stalker and Colonel Lugard, Chief of the Staff, is the credit due for successfully guiding our troops to victory on this occasion.
" 7. The circumstances preceding this satisfactory termination of a brief but arduous campaign I now proceed to eetail for your Excellency's information.
" 8. On the 27th ult. I landed at Bushire and assumed the command of the anny. The vast preparations of the Persian Government for the recovery of Bushire then came to my knowledge. Shooja-ool-Moolk, who commands the Persian troops, had assembled a force, said to amount to 8,500, and subsequently found to be 6,900,* at the town of Burazjoon, 46 miles distant from Bushire, and intrenched his position. This army was well supplied with food and anmmunition, of which considerable magazines had been collected. It was intended that this force should form the nucleus of a very large army to be assembled for the-recapture of Bushire.
9. The First Brigade, Second Division, which arrived on the 31st ultimo and 1st instant, was landed by tho 2d, and
-LUnards, 900; two Karragoozloo Regiments, 1,500; Shiraz Regiment, 200, four regiments of Sabriz, 800; Arab W- menst 900; Kasbkai, 800-5,100; Sufengcheeg, 1.000. CavAlr(s,of Shiraz 300; Eilklhanee, 600-800. Toted6, 903;

on theevening of the 3d the troops, amonting to 4,653 men, and 18 guns, * m e from this camp, without tntb or extra clothing of any sort, ech man arrying his greet coat, blankse, and two days oookaed provisons, the Comuig.
Eariat being provided with threo days' in addition; the' protection of the camp and town of Bushire being duly pro. vided for by a detachment of troops under the eommand of LieutenantuColonel Shepherd, reinforeed by a part
of seamen from all the ship in the harbour, wichthe i Eenior naval officer ws so good a3 to plae at my dispoa
"10. After a march of 46 wiles in 41 hours, during which the troops were expoaed tothe worst of weather, cold
nightg, and deluging storms of rain, they reacbed the enem' 1 entrenched position on the afternoon of the 5th, and found it abandoned; the en emy, onhearing of our approach, had eo uated his entrenchments the previous night so precipitately that histenthand camp oquipageandordnance magazines:rere left behind. The former were being rapidly carried off by village plunderers operating for somenhous beforewe arrived. I endeavoured to intercept the retreat of some of the ' Eilkhanee's ' Horse, who had held the camp during the night, and were still in sight, and a little skirmishing took place, but eventually they madeloff.
" 1. The enemy having sueeeded in withdrawing their gUDs to the strong Pasases, where I did not deem it prudent to follow them, and being satisfied with the moral effect of our occupying their position for two days, I decided upon moving the troops back to Bnshire. The return mrch was accordingly commenod on the night of the7th, fintdestroy ing their magazines, found to contain about 40,ODDlb. of powder with small-arm ammunition and a vast quantity of shot and shell, and carrying away large stores of four, rice, and grain, which the Persian Government had been collect. ing for a long timiepast for their army, thereby effectually crippling their future operations Some of their guns are supposed to have been cast into wells, and, as their wheels and axles fell into our hands, it will be impossible they can be used again for the prent.
"12. At midnight an attack was made upon the rear guard by the enemy's horse, and parties-threatened the line of march on every side. The troops were halted, and so formed as to protect the baggage, and resist the horsemen in whastever direction they might attempt to charge. Four of the enemy's guns of heavy metal opened their fire upon the column, while the darkne6s of the night prevented any steps being taken to captue them.
" 13. I should here sta*o that, on abandoning their posi
tion, Soojah.ool-Moslk, with his force, had taken the ditect road to Shiraz by the 'Ihak' Pass, and the Eilkhanee with his horse had retired by the one lead. ing to the ' Huft Moolls' and from information subsequently received, I len tbat they bad planned a combined attack upon our camp the night we marched ! Indeed, the explosion of their magazines gave them the first intinalion of our departure, when they hastened After us in the expectation of being able to attack us on the line of march, and possibly create confusion and panic in the dark.
" 14. At daybreak the Persian force, amounting to be. tween 6,000 and 7,000 men, with some guns was discovered on our rear left (north.east of our line of march) in order of battle.
" 15. Our artillery and cavalry at once moved rapidly to the attack, supported by two lines of Infantry, a third protecting the Baggage. The firing of the artillery was most excellent, and did great execution; tbe Cavalry Brigade twice charged with great gallantry and success; a sandard of the Kashkai Regular Infantry Regi. ment was capturcd by the Poonsh Horse, and the 3d Light Cavnlry charged a square, and killed nearly tho whole regiment; indeed, upon the avalry and artilery feU the whole brunt of the acon, as the enemy moved away too rapidly for the infantry to overtake them. By 10 o'clock the defeat of the Persians was complete. Two guns were captured, the gun ammunition, laden upon mules, feU into our hands, and at least 700 men lay dead upon the field. The number of wounded could not be asertained, but it must have been very large. The remainder fled in a disorganized sate, generaUy throwing away their arms, which strewed the field in vast numbers, and nothing but the paucity of our cavalry prevented their total destruction and the capture of the remaining guns.
"16. The troops bivouacked for the day close to the battlefield, and at night accomplished a march of 20 miles (by another route) over a country rendered almost impassable by the heavy rain which fell incessantly. After a rest of six hours, the greater portion of the infantry continued their march to Bushire, 'which they reached before midnight, thus performing another most arduous march of 44 miles under incesSant rain, besides fighting and defeating the enemy during its progress within the short period of 50 hours. The cavalry and artilery reached camp this morning.
"17. The result is most satisfactory, and will, I trust, have a very beneficial effect upon our future operations.
"1 . The greatest praise is due to the troops of all arms for their steadiness and gallantry in the field, their extra. ordinary exertions on the march, and their cheerful endurance of fatigue and privation under circumstances rendered doubly severe by the inclemency of the weather to which they were exposed without shelter of any kind; and I can. not too strongly express the obligation I feel to all under my oommand for the almost incredible exertions they have undergone and the gallantry they have displayed on this occasion.
" 19. To Major-General Stalker and to Colonel Lugard my espeoial thanks are due.
" 20. To the heads of the several departments, as well as to every officer belonging to those departments, and to my personal staff (including Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Dunkellin, who volunteeredThis services as aide-de-camp), I am much indebted. From aU I received every possible assistance, and, although I do not now specify by name the department and personal staff and other officers alluded to, I shall hereafter take an opportunity of bringing them individuaUy to your Exoellency's notice. Indeed, when all have behaved so nobly, it is difficult to specify individnals.
" 21. The rapid retreat of the enemy afforded but little opportunity for deeds of special gaUantry. I have already alluded to the successful charges made by the 3d Cavalry and Poonah Horse, under Captain Forbes and Lientenant. Colonel Tapp, and to the very efficient service performed by the Artillery under iAeutenant-Colonel Trevelyan. The Brigadiers commanding the infantry brigades-Wilson, Stisted, and Honner,-with the several commading officers of the regiments, and indeed every officer and soldier of the force, earned my warmest approbation.
" 22. To the medical officers of the force I am under great obligation for their untiring exertions throughout these arduous operations.
" 23. 1 cannot conclude without alluding in strong terms to the valuable assistance I have received from Major Taylor, whose services were placed at my disposal by the Hon, C. A. Murray, C.B.

Musical Union.
.MUSIOAL UWION.
The last of the soir6cs-to whieh, coming so close to the regular season, it would have been irrelevant to attach the old title of "winter musical evenings"-termiated the early series of concerts in a ery briliant manner. The first appearance of Herr Ernst is aways a strong attractionand on the present occasion it became more than usually so, since the great German violinist Was never in better vein. His playing i the two quartets -MDozarts No. 10 (D), an endelssohn's No. 4 (E minor)-was nothing short of perfection. >No twO works could maore essentially differ. Mastermieces both, they have absolutely ncthing in common. The versatile master of style was tberefore the more evidently manifest in the admirable pro-
ietno less than poetical feeling and faultless mechaism, y w ch Herr Ernat's execution of both of them was distInguished. Mozartes quartet is not merely interesting on account of its own abstract merits. Theevidentsource whence Beethovenderivedtheideaof hisanimatedfinaleto thequarteSt in F, Op. 1S-one of his best-conducted and iost spirited alegros-may be traced to the last movement of Mozart
whose ingenious manner of developing the principal theme was equally productive of suggestions for his gifted successor. Both quartets enraptured the audience, whop,but that Herr Ernst is happily one of those artists averse to the system of encores, would willingly have listened to the irresistible scherzo-a scherzo extraordinary even for Mendelssohn, in this kind of movement without a rival-which was performed in a way we bave never heard surpassed. Herr Ernst's associates were Herr Goffrie (second violin), Ndr. Blagrove (viola), and Signor Piatti (violoncello). It would not be easy to match such a party of musicians " di camcra," in any town of Europe,
A new trio in A (Op. 27), the composition of M. Silas, for pianoforte, violin, and violonoello, was very finely executed by Herr Pauer, Herr Ernst, and Signor Piatti. and excited the utmost interest, It is the work of a thoughtful and inteligent musician, and, although diffhse in certain tarts, bears evidence of a musically independent mind, which works out a problem of its own in its own fashion. The first allegro and the Prcsto (finalc) appeared to us, as well as we were able to judge from - minglc hearing, the most vigorous and best conducted movements; but the whole trio afforded evident gratification, and the successful result fully justified the directors of the Musical Union-generally (and perhaps of necessity) so cbary in the bringiug forward new oompositions of importance-in for once m a way allowing the cnef d'o uvres of the acknowledged great masters to give way to the essay of a musician comparatively unknown. Too warm uraise cannot possibly be accorded to Herr Paner for the idmir. able style in which he played the pianoforte part-a task byno means easy - of his coadjutors, from whom something near perfection is invariably expected, we need say nothing, unless that they performed the violin and violoncello parts as became them.
Some glees. very finely sung by the Vocal union (Messrs. T. Foster, Wilbye Cooper, Montem Smith and W. Winn), agreeably relieved the instrumental music.
SHIPWRECKS.-The Yorkshire papers record
ISHiPWRECKS.-The Yorkshire papers record Feveral shipwrecks, attended with loss of life, during the recent gale. The Peamore, Graves, of Eseter aDd from Rotterdam, went ashore at Seaton Carew on the 20th, and became a complete wreck ; the Morgiana, of Hartlepool, coal laden, and the Cressinus, of Srborough, were wrecked on the Middleton Sands. The crews were saved. Oa the 21st the schooner Venue, Captain Kinsford, from Sandvich to Sunderland, hoisted a signal of distress off Bridlington-bay, bat the wind was very strong and the sea so boisterous that it was utterly impossible to get a boat outt of the harbour or launched from the land. Several persons waited on shore to render assistance, and after dusk lighted a fire to indicate the spot where the vessel might have been ran ashore - but between 9and 10 o'clock several l eces of the vessel and things she bad contained were wasVed in to land, but no human being from the wreck was visible. On the eveninr of the same day a vessel broke from her anchorage near nridlington-bay, and all hands met with a watery grave.

The vessel held on till 9 o'clock at night, when her lights disappeared. I believe she foundered at her anchor, and immediately broke up, for the wreck came ashore soon afterwards, which, when exanidned was found to be completely decayed. Had the vessel slipped from her anchors or driven asbore, from her light draught of water no doubt all hands would have been saved; unbappily they perished. She was too far out to reach her with the rocket apparatus. A small jollyboac has been washed ashore without damage.

Wednesday Evening.
The English funds openea this morning at the final quotations of yesterday, but became dull almost immediately, ani remained without recovery to the ternminat:on of business. The first transactions in Consols for money were at 93E to , and they left off at 93i to # for money, b3g for the account on the 8th inst., and 94A to I for the new account on the 7th of May. The adverse tendency of the market was owing entirely to the knowledge ihat half a million of gold in bars and sovereigns has been taken from the Bank during the past week. The announcement of arrivals, however, from Mexico and Australia was calculated to counteract in a considerable degree this unfavourable feeling. There have been no further withdrawals from the Bank to-day, and the demand for money, considerng the near approach of the 4th of the month, hvs b. en moderate. Bank Stock left off at 220 to 222 with dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; India B1onds, 3s. discount to Is. premium ; Exchequerbonds, 98 to i ; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
Foreign securities were not generally well supported, but a slight recovery took place towards the close. Mexican formed an exception, and, owing to purchases, a rise of about one-half per cent. c ccurred, which was fairly maintained. The operations for money were at 23i, and for the account at 231, g, 1, i, B, and . In Turkish Six per Cents. the bargains were at 597g and : for money, and 97k, '8S and 41 for the account. The Four per Cents. (;uarI.nteed, for the account, were purchased at 101J. Thel general business comprised-Brazilisn Four-and-a-RHalf per Cents., New, 981 ; ChilHan Six per Cents., 1021 ex div. ; Peruvian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 77 ; the Three per Cents., for the a<cont.t, 54 ex div.; Russian Foiur-and-a-Half per Cents., SC ; Spanish Three per Cents., 41k ; Passive, 51 ; Venezuela Deferred, 14i ; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97 ex div.
The corn-market was extremely heavy this morning at the decline of Monday.
The closing prices of the French Three per Cents. Oli the Paris Bourso this evening were 70f. 5c. for money and C9f. 95c. for the present account, showing a decline of a-half per cent., caused probably by a pressure for money in tho progress of the liquidation.
The WhIiite Star has arrived from Melbourne, but her amount of gold remains to be ascertained, The advices from Australia received to-day mention that the Orwell had left, and that the Royal Charter (steamer) was to sail on the 12th of January. Each of these vessels have remittances, and some estimate the total of the three at 200,000 ounces, or 800,0001.
The specie brought by La Plata to-day from the West Indies and Mexico is 335,0001., comprising 157,5001. gold and 177,5001. silver. It is stated that the Alexican packet of the next month will bring 600,0001. in silver, the conducta, which left the city of Mexico on the 23d of February with an unusually heavy amount, not having arrived at Vera Cruz in time for the present steamer.
It is now estimated that the shipments of specie by tho Peninsular and Oriental steamer Colombo, with the India and China mails of the 4th, will amount to at least '00,0001., principally silver. An impression seems to be gaining ground that from this date the shipments are likely to become less heavy. At all events, the arrival by La Plata today will partially meet the demand for the next fortnightly steamer, after which the sum to be expected from Mexico will he calculated to lessen the activity of purchasers on the Continent.
The Royal Mail steamer Orinoco, which sails for the West Iiidies to-morrow, takes out 86,5481., of which 60,7881. is gold, and 25,7601. silver.
The preparations for the Atlantic telegraph are expected to be completed by the time originally named. About 650 miles of the cable out of the 2,200 are now finished, and the aggregate rate of constr-uction at the works of Messrs. Kuper and Co., at C.rcenwich, and Messrs. Newall and Co., at Iiirkenhead, is more than 200 miles per week. The wMhole line is to be shipped by the end of June, and the communication is hoped to be established by the ixiiddle of July.
The advices from Mexico received this afternoon reach to the 4th of March, and show that great surprise and disappointment will be experienced in that capital when it is found that the proposed treaty with the United States has been rejected at Washington. The general opinion, both in political and commercial circles, was that it was certain to be ratified. It was known, however, to have been regarded with much displeasure by the representatives of the European Powers at Mexico ; and, as one of its chief points was to establish free trade in certain articles with America on the northern or land frontier, excluding tho coast lines, which would have rendered necessary the concession of similar privileges to other nations, it seems to have contemplated the granting of a monopoly which could not fail to have led to strong reclamations-a point which probably did not escape the observation of the United States' Cabinet. " The carrying trade," it is reniarked in the present advices, " wiU in consequence of this treaty doubtless pass almost exclusively into the hands of the Americans." It appears that the scheme was initiated by General Gadsden, the American Minister, two years ago, and that it had been kept secret until within a few days of its being signed. In reliance upon its being carried oiit, and that General Comonfort, the President, would thus be placed in the immediate receipt of large funds there was a disposition to believe that he wonld be able for the present to maintain his Governmuent against all attacks, especially as the whole of the late attempts at insurrection have now been completely quelled, with the exception of that headed by General Blancarte in Guadalajara, which was likely to be put down forthwith. When, however, it is found that the Treasury mnust relapse into sometbiiig worse than its ordinary state of embarrassment, since it is reported that General Comonfort has already obtained advances from Mexican capitalists on the faith of the treaty, a very different state of feeling will perhaps arise. In that case it wiU not be surprising if the exigency should be met by some hasty sale of territory on the California frontier, wlich wiU hasten the extinction of the cotuntrv as an independent State. The session of Congress had terminated, and General Comonfort would retain supreme authority until the next election for President in September next. In anticipation of the American loan, the exchange on London had fluctuated between 46id. and 47d.
Accordiiig to on account lately published in one of the MIexican papers, some new goldfields have been discovered upon the borders of the State of Chihualiua, which are said to be far richer than tlose of California. The report states that they are situate near a lake named Jaco, to the south.east of the city of Chihuahua, and just upon the territory kniown as the favourite haunt of the wild Indians.
The followiing is from the Committee of Mexican bondlioldersl_
" The committee have received advices from Mr. Whitehead, dated Mexico, the 3d nit. He advises having sent t4,598-1S to Vera Croz for this packet, but there is no account nf their having been shipped from Vera Cruz, and the packet brings no other remittances for the dividend fund. Politics were getting into a more settled state, but the Congress, by absolving Senor Degollado from responsibility in the ' Barron' qnestion bad again stirred up the embers of that dispute. It was supposed that Senor Fuentes, late Minister of Foreign Affairs, would be ap. pointed to succeed Senor Lerdo in the Department of Finance."
The suspension has been announced of the house of Mr. N. Zygomalas, engaged in the Mediterranean corn trade. The amount of liabilities has not transpired, but it is believed to be small. The principal connexions of the house are at Marseilles.
At a meeting of the General Screw Steam Company, held to-day, MTr. Raikes Currie in the chair, the report was adopted. The principal discussion was connected with the steps necessary to effect a final liquidation, and it was agreed to authorize the directors to dispo e of the remaining assets and make a last division among the sbareholders. An approximate statement was presented, which showed a deficiency in the capital of 147,4591., but it was explained that full reliance must not be placed in it, as some of the items may hereafter vary. Mr. C. W. C. Hutton, one of the honorary auditors, entered into figures exhibiting the result of operations during the five years from June, 1852, to February, 1857. Including the whole of the net revenue, and deducting the dividends declared in June and December, 1855 (altogether 49,0421.), the total sum absorbed in that period has been upwards of 490,0001. The loss on the sale of the eight large ships has been 325,6421.; the loss on nine small ships, 66,3121.; the loss on Indian voyages, 21,3771., and the expenditure on management luring five years nearly 70,0001. This unfortunate
vpsion was attributed to one of two causesaluilwot failure of the srew principle as an
' steam navigation, or to mismanage-
ment. The announcement created a great impression, and several shreholders expressed surprise at the amount of the general expenditure. In answer to a question it was meniioned that only 15,0001. of the 25,0001. deposit forfeited by the Socid'U Genhale des Clippers Fraviais appears in the account, 10,0001. having been paid to settle a commission claim for a larger amount raised by the agents who negotiated the original contract. After some further conversation, the following resolution was adopted:-
"That considering the great delay and exponse which must attend the gradual winding up of the company under the provisions or the 98th clause of the deed of settlement it is resolved,-That the directors be authorized hereby to make a sale of all the assets, subject to liabilities, at sacl a lump sun as they shall think fair and sufficient- and tbat thereupon a final division be paid to the shareholders in full of all claims on their parts."
Annexed is an abstract of the report, together with the approximate statement:.-
" In November the board were called upon to consider a conditional proposition for the purchase of the fleet by Mesrs. Crawford and Round, at a price which the directors were willing to accept. But in order that the company might not be deprived of any chance of making a sale for cash they made it a condition of their contract with Messrs. Crawford and Bound that they should be at liberty to accept any cash offer of a price superior or equal to that offered by them if made beforethecompletionof thetransfertothosegentlemen. No such offer was made during the interval of more than a month which elapsed after the date of the provisional agreement with Messrs. Crnwford and Round, although the ships were fully advertised for sale. Messrs. Crawford and Round were eventually unable to carry out their first proposal, but made another offer to the board, which was ultimately acceded to. In a matter of so much difficulty the board earnestly desired to pursue that course which would be sanctioned and approved by the proprietary at large, and, fortunately, Mdessrs. Crawford and Round's scheme did practically test the opinions of the shareholders; holders representing 33,6S1 shares, out of a total of 47,272, affirmed the sale by their assent, becoming, in fact, purchasers of their own property, while 13,591 shares accepted the proceeds of the sale in cash. As soon as the dissolution of the companv was determined on the directors gave notice to all the ofcers of the establishinent that their connexion with the company would cease, which notice expireson the 20th of next month; they have also taken steps to cancel the lease of the premises on the shortest legal notice, and the directors will return to the funds of the company 2,400l~, instead of 1,2001., as heretofore, out of the sum allotted to them. The Bosphorns, the only ship remaining of the comp any, is in excellent condition, and has been offered for sale privately, but, if not previously disposed of, she will be put up to public auction on the 9th of A priL.

A meeting of the shareholders of the 9ational Brazilian Mining Association was held to-day, Mr. R. Sheppard in the chair, when a resolution was passed approving the] measures adopted by the comnmittee for securing the property through an appeal to Chancery. The whole of the details respecting the contest between the comnmittee and Mr. Edward Oxenford were entered into, and the committee state they have every reason to believe the estates and mines may be turned to advantageous account. The presence of Mr. Bitchens in Brazil has enabled him to make arrangements for obtaining possession, and to secure 12,0001., part of the money falling due for the hire of the company's servants. The latest advices, although not direct from Mr. Hitchens, indicate that he is working the Cocaes Mine on a small scale, and sending the gold to Messrs. Kerr, Colins, and Co. Lord Clarendon has afforded the committeej support, and despatched instructions to the Minister at Rio do Janeiro to forward the views of the representative of the company. With regard to the proceedings in Chancery for dealing with the assets and liabilities it was mentioned that the latter will be thoroughly examined before they are allowed and that the notice for caling in the scrip .ough the same channel is with the view of reorganizing the association, and placing it under limited liability. Several plans have been suggested for effecting this object without inconvenience to the scripholders, but as yet they are immature. It is, however, intended, if possible, to raise through a new company an additional capital, and the first step will be to release the mortgage deeds held by Messrs. Kerr, Collins, and Co,, who have professed their readiness to take shares for a portion of the 4,0001. due to them.
The Star of Tasmania, from Launceston, which has made the passage in 77 days, brings the intelligence of the arrival of the Oneida steamer at Melbourne on the 23d of December, and Sydney on the 29th.
The statement of Sir William Magnay to the Court of Aldermen last week, with regard to the administration of justice in Belgium in cases of debt, has led to representations being made on behalf of several English sufferers in that country. A correspondent points out that accordin to the existing law any foreign resident chargeg with a debt, however trifling, may have his domicile burst open and be dragged to prison without notice, writ, or trial, where, if unable to pay, he may languish all his life, there being no Insolvent Court for him to apply to. The treatment which accompanies their detention is also alleged to be cruel sometimes andl insulting as compared with the practice in this country.
At the Court of Bankruptey to-day Mr. Apsley Pellatt underwent a lengthened examination in relation to the affairs of the Royal British Bank.
The annexed account of the Manehester market during the past month is from Messrs. Robert Barbour and Brother:-
" There has been little change in the position of this market since the commencement of the year. The engrossing subject continues to be the high value of the raw material and the impossibility, in many cases, of obtaining corresponding prices for yarn and manufactured goods. iEarly in the present month there was a good demand for yarns and fabncs suitable for the India markets, but this was soon supplied, and on the wihole the market has since been dull and irregular. Stocks of goods, more particularly during the last ten days, have increased, and the tendency of prices has been slightly in favour of buyers; it is hoped, however, now that the excitement of the election is over, more business will be done. Buyers give present rates with reluctaned and hesitation, as foreign markets have not yet responded to the high prices rulinghere. The home atrde dealers also confine their operations to immediate wants, as it is not considered prudent to lay in stocks in the present position of the market."
The returns of circulation of the Irish and Scotch banks for the four weeks ending the 14th of February, when, added together, give the following as the average weekly circulation of.these banks during the past month, viz.:
Average circulation of the Irish banks ...... Â£7,253,905 Average circulation of the Scotch banks ... 3,957,810
Average circulation during past month ... Â£11,211,715 On comparing the above with the fixeed issues of the several banks, as given in the Banking A'man,ac the following appears to be the state of tae circuilation:-
The Irish banks are above their fixed issue ... Â£899,411 The Scotch banks are above their fixed issue ... 870,601
Total above the fixed issue ... ... ... 1,770,012 The amounts of gold and silver held at the head offices of the several banks during the past month have been as follows
Gold and silver held by the Irish banks ... Â£2,711,446 Gold and silver held by the Scotch banks ... 1,723,403
Total of gold and silver held ... ... Â£4,433,849 The above statements complete the returns of the circulamion. in England, Scotland, and Ireland for the month ending the 14th of February, which were partly inserted in The Times of the 1st of April.
These returns, combined with the average circulation of the Bank of England for the same period, will give the following results of the circulation of notes in the United Kingdom when compared with the previous month,,
showing a decrease of 258,1661. in the circulae, tion of notes in England, and a decrease of 340,2361. in the circulation of the United Kingdom when compared with the month ending the 17th of January. And, as compared with the month ending thel6thof February, 1856, the above returns show a decrease of 52,517. in the circulation of notes in England, and an increase of 349,0751. in the circulation of the United Kingdom.
The average stock of bullion held by the Bank of England in both departments during the month
ending the 14th of February was 10,123,7911., being a decrease of 52 2371. as compared with the previous month, and a,,decrease of 425,7571. when compared with the saie perigd last year.
The stock of specie held by the Scotch and Irish banks during the month endinlg the 14th of February was 4,433,8491., b)eing de-crease of 163,7001. as compared with thle previous return, and al increase of 383,2721. when compared with the corresponding period last year.

The Lundhill Colliery Explosion.
THB LUIVDHZLL COLLIEBY EXPLOSxOy.
Upwards of a week has now elapsed since the commence. nient of operations for emptying the pit, during which time proceedings have gone on with the greatest activity, and no Interruptions have taken place. Rmumours were afloat on Tuesday that some portions of the unfortunate men killed by the explosion had been drawn out with the water. On visiting 'th pit this was found to be incorrect, although several pieces of wood and other d4trLs had been brought up. The pit presents a busy scene, a good number of workmen being employed in vanous occupations connected with the clearing ofthe shaft and reception o' the bodies, some of which it is expected will sbortly be found at the 'bottom of the shaft, if they do not even rise to the surface of the water. The gentlemen who have undertaken the emptying of the pit and recovery of the bodies, believing that when the water gets unroofed it is more than probable that the body of gas which has been forced back by the water may escape and came another explosion, have issued peremptory orders against the use of ights and smoking, as weU as not to allow persons to approaca the works. Some idea of the time it will take to clear the pit may be inferred from what has already been done. On Tuesday, the 24th, when drawing commenced, the water was 60 feet high* on Tuesda
last (eight days) the wate had decreased 1 feet. Since then, however, new buckets have been fitted up, and it is expected that a much larger quantity wil be daily drawn. A month at least wil elapse before the great nmber of bodies will be reached, as there must necessarily be considerable delay after the water has been unroofed in disentangling the chair at the. bottom from the quantity of wood, coal, and rubbish in which it is fixed, the entire power of the engine having been unable to move it. This will have to bo done ere the great number of the bodies can be got out. Many of them, it is to be feared, will havr been altogether consumed, particularly those in tbe vicinity of the curola (and being dinner hour at the time of the explosion there was a larger number there) by the fire which raged most fearfully in that part of the pit. Considerable excitement stil exists among the colliens, and the slightest accident at any of the collieries creates an alarm. A case of this sort occurred at the Edmund's Main Colliery (a short distance from Lundhill) on Friday last. From some unexplained cause about 31b. of gunpowder, which one of the men had with him, exploded. Upon hear. ing it the men rushed to the shaft bottom signallin to be drawn up, and the whole of the men in a state of alarm came out of the pit.
The subscriptions for the relief of the sufferers up) to the present time amount to nearly 8,0001., and the committee have in contemplation the carrying out of the suggestion of Mr. Joseph Locke, M.P.-the forming of a permanent fund for the relief of the widows of miners killed by accidents in coal-pits, and the forming of an institution for the education and bringing up oZ the children. The suggestion has met with considerable encouragement, and there is no doubt that the coUliery proprietors of the district will liberally contribute towards the establishment of an institution the want of which has long been acknowledged, and which wil be the means of doing an incalculable amount of good to a class hitherto lttle thought of or cared for.

TheC AO seida ehadtoongratulteoheshareholders upon another very impaortant point having been gained in he litigations with the Edinburgh and Glagow Eallwynamely, tho question on what nmount of capital the interest or rent was to be paid, which question had been decided in favour of their claims. The Edinburgh and Glasgow, however, had just given them noticeo that they meant to appeal all the interlocutors of the Court of Seesion in favour of this company, going as far back as 1853, notwithstanding their recent and distAict intimations to their own shareholders that they wishod these liti.gations now to end. He regretted that, from the continued litigation with which they had been harrassed, the directors had not been able to bring before the shareholders their views upon the mode of disposing of the arrears found due to this company and of raising new capital, and he much feared that this new intimation of the intention of the lesees to carry them again to the House of Lords would still further prolong the time. They hbd, however, been pMing off their

Mr. WARDLAW RAIISAY seconded the motion.
After some discussion the report was adopted, and an interim dividend of 6s. per share was declared accordingly.

The Apprehended Murrain.
THE APPREHEHDZD MURRAINr.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME.s
Sir,-I beg to submit to you the following remarks on.n cerning the murrain whhich is not prevailing" on the cop tinent and which it is feared may extend'to Englad.
In a QcQsvPtion upon thi subjeGt Which took Iahoefi the Souse of Commons shortly before the dissolution -o
Parliament it was assnmed by the spekers that there wu great cause of dread lest the murrain should be introduce into England by the importation of diseased cattle from continentil ports, and the general tendency of the conersae' tionh Was such as to direct attention exclusively to the pro. bability of the disease being excited in this kingdom byim. Portation, and, consequently, to the adoption of a sAric quartnte as a preventive measure.
The disease now prevailing epidemicaUy imong cattle orI the continent, so far as I can ascertain, is chacgteriz
chiefly by a pulmonary affection, in which the principal pathological change is induration of the lungs, a chanks In which' the density of the lungs becomes greater,sand In which the lung-tissue becomnes nore friable, bre.kigreadily
beneath tbe fingers The disease is exceedingly fatal, aSI it is-reported to be highly contagious.
In this district of Yorkshire a peculiar form of disease,' _ principally affecting the lungs, has prevailed more or Ie3 - among cattle for several years. This diseasc is generallyboe lieved to bo an idiopathic lung disease, but it is more pro. bably a trce febrile disorder, of vwhich the affection of - the ltngs forms an integral portion, giving a specific charaftea to the disease, and having the same relation to the febrila symptoms that the intestinal affection has to the general disorder of tho system in the common typhoid fever of the country.
This lung disease is very deadly; it is reputed to be highly cont.gious, and during the lat four or five years it hsa Shown a disposition to assme sn epidemic form. It lag broken out from time to timb in' the crowded cattlesheds of our larger farmsteads, sweeping off a considerable portion of the cattle in 10 days or a fortnight, and in some instance3 it has been necessary to sell off the whole of the stock, and to leave the sheds vacaut for a period, in order to inre their purificatiok and disinfection, T'he most conspicous3 pathological appearances found in cattle dead from this'dis. ease are a darldy congested and friable condition of the lung,, and diatension of the large-veins at the root of the heart, with a huge fibrinous clot. The disease is known commonly as " Tho New Delight."'
Without assuming that this disease is identical with the pulmonary murrain which prevails on the continent, there can be no doubt that-a pulmonary iffection is now present among the cattle of this district, and I have reason to believe of other districts of Great Britain, which is rapidly taking 6n an epidemic character, which is very deadly, and which is popularly believed to be highly contagious.
With these premonitions of murain among us, the direc. tion of public attention too exclusively to a fear of the introduction of murrain from abroad, and consequently to aa undue dependence upon seaboard quarantine, is a serious error. The history of the pulmonary affection which already prevails, and has prevailed for some time, among the cattle of this district is sufficient to show that immediate and telling measures of internal hygiene are required, and that to these the attention of farmers and of the public generally should be most particularly directed.
The existence of the fatal lung disease for so long a periol in this distlict, the occurrence of the disease in a sporalio form, and the gradual manner in which its epidemic charac ter is being developed, are ufficient to show that other and more important agencies than contagion are concerned in its diffusion; and it may be surmised that a mnore aecurate examination of tho facts connected with the dispersion of the disease will considerably modify the wild notions of con, tagion which have been broached, and which unfortunately tend to distract the mind, diverting it from those local measures of precaution which are so important.
Urged by the importance of the subject, and of the nece. sity that there seems to me for some check to be interposel to the erroneous notions engendered by the form which the conversation on the murrain assumed in the House of Commons, and pending the researches now being made under t e authority of the Board of Health, I venture to draw your attention to this matter and to crave the exertion of your great influence in directing the attention of our fa-ners and all whom it may concern to the necessity for immodiate measures of internal hygione; to the necessity for diminishing the crowded condition of cattle-sheds, and of iasuring and fficient ventilation of them; to the adoption of means for attaining and maintaining thorough cleanliness of everything in and about cattle-sheds; to the keeping of the cattl3 as much as practicable in the open fields now that the warmer seasons of the year are approaching; and to the Separation of all suspected animals, care being taken, how. ever, not to keep them confined to fuul yards, or to foul and ill-ventilated sheds.
The mode in which the disease xeizes upon a crowded cattle-shed, and abides there, forming a deadly locality of infection, after the fashion of plague and cholera, is a matter of most pressing importance to the farmer, as an indication ofthe precautionary measures to be adopted. From the infection of the cattlesheds, induced by a crowded state, the disease once having broken out, more danger is to be feared than from communication of the disease by contact. Hence the importance of thinning out the cattle, and of free ventilation.
in this district, and in moat others that I am acquainted with, tho type of 1a cattle-shed is a long low building, with a slightly sloping roof, the only apertures for ventilation being the door, one, or at most two, small windows, and, per. haps, the crevices of the roof. It is essentialthat this vault. like condition of cattle'-sheds should be immediately done away with, either by the formation of large and properly protected openings above each stall; or at short Intervals iaong the roof, or, beter still, by rauning a broad alit along the whole extent of the roof. This might readily be done in most heds,. and a little ingenuity would soon devise means for erecting a roof above the aperture, so s to prevent the intrusion of rain without impediDg ventilation,
In the autumn and winter of 1855, while serving on the staff of his Highness Omar Paha, I had an opportunity of witnessing the devastations of the murrain which at that time prevailed in Asia Minor. That murrain was characterized by an intestinal affection. It was a choleraic murrain, and it was regarded by the natives as being intensely contagious, but the evidence in support of this belief was of the most worthless character. The murrain Sas excessively fatal, and it seems to me that the only method by which it could possibly have been mitigated was by the early institution of measures such as I have detailed above.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
dNU. N. RADCLIFFE,
Surgeon.

The Division Test.
THE DIVISOrN TEST.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-As you have brought my name before the public in a disparaging tone with reference to my estimate of the value of the division list as a test of the efficiency of a member of Parliament, I trust you will allow me a few words in explanation. And first, my statement was only made comparatively with regard to my late coUeague, who was boasting, as he is a little apt to do, of his great parformnances, in answer to which I was adopting somethincg of Hamlet's call upon Laertea-
Nay, and thou'lt miouth, "I'll rant aw well as thoe."
I agree with you that the number of divisions attended is a poor test of a member's usefulness. The way in which he votes is, of course, of much more importanoe than the number of votesgwhich:hermay give. Moreover, the number of divisions is nota fair test of the number of hours which a member may devote to his attendance in the H.,se, be. cause very few divisions comparatively occur upon private bi and the bulk are taken between 8 in the evening and
ia s that y member may very well come at one dbourand vdpart at the other without missing many, and this accounts pretty nearly for the difference in divisions attended between iy late colleague and myself. Perhdap you wpil allow me to say that I voted upon these divisions because I was there, and not that I was there because I omight vote upon the divisions, Then, again, as to the 700 or nOO votes which I have given in the last five yeour, YoKe are pleased to say that I conld have had very litte information upon most of the subjects to which they referrdo. Hlerein Isubmit you may be inerror. Scarcely any vote is
taken without some previous debate, and. A man who attends debates as I have done is anrely at a loss how to vote uPOn anysubjeetwhichs h ashearddisionu dt Eveni f this should be the case, there is generally some friend who has attended more particularly to the subject than himself, uPOn whose judgmenrt he can rely. I do ast deny that there may be some subjects upon which it may be difficult to decide~, and upon which a member may very properly walk out before the division, as many do; but I think the habit of forcing yourself to decide one way or the other uapon e-very question brought before you is a good one, and tends to exercise the judging faculties I cani assure you that I had no idea of putting my merits in juxtaposition with those of Sir Wil. flam Clay. H is long services entitle him to bthe indulgence of a less assiduots Attendance than could be fairly allowed
to a Young member like myself, who was obliged to nakeup by diligence and assiduity for his want of ability and oter deficiencies. If I had done the State as mnuch service as Sir William Clay I should, perhaps, have been lows scrupulous in imy attendanee at the House of Commons.

The Elections.
THE ELECTIONS.
WILTS (SOUTH).
(FROM OuR ONWN RRPORTER.)
The nomiMation ot caneicates lor the southern division oE Wiltshire took place yesterday at Salisbury. Three gentle. Daon were proposed to the electors-Mr. S. Herbert, Mr. Wyndham, and Lord Henry Thynne. In the last Parliamient the division was represented by Mr. Herbert ;nd lMr. Wyndliam; and Lord Henry, who is a brother of the lIarquis of Bath, now presents himself for the first time to ihe constituency. He is a Conservative, an upholder of rixisting institutions in Church and State, and, if elected, will act with the party of Lord Derby. In his address he gtates that he comes forward in fulfilment of a pledge which lie gave some time ago, and it is generally understood, though 2neither he nor his *riends have said so, that he aims Ast the seat lately occupied by Mr. Herbert. The con. Jest between hinm and that gentleman is expected to ba a v-ry keen one. Both have been untiring in their exertions alriog the last fortnight to recommend themselves to the electors, by addressii;g public meetings and conducting a persconal canvass in :11 parts of the division, and at present their friends appear to be equally sanguine of success. There are o,239 voters on the roll, and it is believed that rearly the whole of them will exercise their franchise on Â£aturday next, the day fixed for the polling, The last tilzme the divisiou was contested upwards of 1,500 votes were given for Mr. Herbert, but since then, as his opponents assert, he has lost the confidence of many of his former supporters. Apart from his share in the abolition of the corn laws-which, howvev,-, has not been forgotten or forgiven Ly the farmers,-his real or supposed connexion with the mismanagement wvhich marked the early stages of the Crimean war, and his recent vote against the Government on theChinese question, have, it is said, caused considerable dies athifaction among the constituency. On the other hand, his friends declare that, although at one period there might have been somne foundation for such a statement, yet the explanations he has recently given to the electors have completely removed every ground of complaint against him. The representations of the respective comnmittees relative to the result of the canvass in the different districts are equally contradictory. It seems to be rertain, however, that the main strongth of the Thynne party lies in the direction of Warminster, where the Marquis of Bath holds extensive property, although the friends of Mr. Herbert allege that even in the neighbourhood of Longleat itself many persons have pledged themselves to vote for him. Around Salisbury, and over the whole district covered by the Wilton estates, Mr. Herbert will, of course, have a large majority. During the next two days the canvass will be prosecuted with increased vigour on both sides. The excitement is already very great in all parts of the division, and nowhere more so than in Salisbury. Squibs in prose and verse are issued in vast quantities, and all the cead walls about the place-how numerous and extensive ihese are is known only to those who have visited Salisbury-are eloquent with the war-cries of the rival candidstes, Lord Henry appears to have acquired a monopoly of the poetic ta.lent in the city. Itis not, certainly, of tl,e most brilliant kind. One gentleman, who is exceedingly fond of italics and capital letters, tells the electors that
" Withouit a fault, and lots of ttn,
" The best of the ' jeIs Lord Henry Thynne."
Another, who publishes uierbcrt's Zrment, is savagely sarcastic, but slightly incoherent. The prose is upon the whole Lbetter than the poetry, hut not superior to the generality of such productions. On the walsinjunctions to poll early, and the somewhat hackneyed and vulgar cries of "No Popery
" Down with the tritor i" "Hang Herbert !" are mingled with such questionsas "Who sent out the greeucoffee7" "WVho starved the soldiers?" "Who betrayed the farmers?" The friends of Mr. Herbert do not distingnish themselvesinthis species of warfare; but in oneortwo places "Thynne-a?,,juis in hei-, " neatly and classically, Vf nut very intelligibly to tho.se for whose delight the saressni is intended, expresses their opinion of the rival candidate.
TIhe nomiination took place on hustings erected at the Counicil-cbainber, facing the market-place,-onc of the most spacious in Englanid. The weather was favourable, and by 11 o'clock, the houir fixed for the commenceinent of the proeeedings, several thousand persons had assembled to hear the speeches. A considerable number of them appeared to be agricultural labourers; but, though rather noisy at timis, their conduict during the day was goodhumoured and orderly. A row of carriages, occupled chiefly by ladics, was drawn round the sdrts of the crowd, and all the windows looking upon the market-place were filled vithl spectators. Mr. Wyndham arrived first at the beastigs; le was accompanied by the members of his conmittee, siau was well received by the people. Mr. S. Herbert followed, surrounded by a considerable number of his principal supporters, and was loudly cheered. Lord Ilenry Thynne, who wats also well supported by his friends, was greeted with cheering, mingled with some expressions of disapprobation. Tho usual preliminaries having beRn gone tl,rough, and M1r. Morrison, the High Sheriff, having craved a fair hearing 'or the speakers.
Mr. 'ONVELI, Hurcote, nominated Mr. Sidney Herbert; and Mr. JACOBS, of the Close, Salisbury, seconded the nominati, II.
Mr. AlATCIIANI, Chairman of Quarter-Sessions, proposed Air. W'yndhain, whoni he eulogised as a good neighbour, a conmiderato landlord, and a just and impartial magistrate.
Mr. HINXM AN, l)iirnford, seconded the nomination.
br. Psnrrs, Leighton, proposed Lord Henry Thynne, and in doing so made a bitter attack upon Mtr. Herbert, who, lie said, bestrode the county like a colossus, and aimed at reducing it to the state of a rotten borough. But the electors were tired of the domination of the house of Pen,hroke, and gladly welcomed a young and gallant candidate in the person of Lord Henry thynne, whio was an advoc.. o for those judicious, moderate, and progressive courses fron, which alone tlie permanent prosperity of the country couhl proceed. Belonging to a family of the highest rank, in nppearance he was one of nature's noblemen (laughter), and it was only reasonable to suppose that so fair an outside must be tho reflection of much that was good within. (Cheers and lauglhter.) Lord Henry, mo,cover, was one of the best sportsmen in the cout. ty (renewed laughter), and the hunting-field was not a bad school for acquiring a knowledge of the arts of peace as well as those of war, for those who had graduated there had oftcin distinguished themselves not only in the camp, but also in the senate. (Cheers.)
The Rev. AsrTITUst FANB, vicar of Warminster, wvho has taks n a rather active part against Mr. Herbert came forward to second the nomination of Lord Henry Thynne; but Ilis appearance was thesi gual for a violent outbreak, which prevented his being heard for several miniutes. Whenever
eattempted to speak his voice was drowned by hisses, cheers, and cries of various kinds, and it was not until Mr. llerhert used his good offices with the crowd on his behalf tbat he could obtain a hearing. The rev. gentleman complained that Mr. Herbert bad represented him in a published letter as rejoicing that the poor man had to pay a high price for his loaf. No man felt greater sympathy for the poor than he did, and be would be glad if the means of livin were maore witliin their reach than at present. He stated that Mr. Herbert bad been turned out with the Aberdeen (Government for having mismanaged the war, and chlarged the riglt lion. genitleman with having deserted Lord Palnierston at a timue vwhen our soldiers were dying by hundreds from hunger, starvation, and disease in the CrimeX. Mr. Herbert, he said, made the bitterest speech against the Govenr,ment which was delivered in the House of Commons on the Chinese question. If they were for Lord Palmerston they could not vote for Mr. Herbert; while, if they were not for Lord Palmerston, they could not vote for Mr. W3nd.arm. Both their late representatives could not be right in the votes wbich they gave on the Chinese question.
Mr. S. HERBERT, on coming forward to address the electors, was received with great and general cheering. He Eaid,-Gentlemnen and brother electors, I am heartily obliged to you for giving a fair hearing to the seconder of Lord henry Thynne. I trust that he and his friends will do me the same favour and listen to the few observations which I have to make. (Cheers.) I have had an opportunity of addressing the electors of this county so frequently during the last week that I shall be able to coumpress what I have to say-a statement w hich you wiU be glad to hear-within very narrow limits. Tho rev. gentleman who seconded the nomination of Lord Ilenry Thynne is rather fond of indulg. Iug in historical recollections, and aU the complaint I have Lo mike of him is that his English history is not always in strict accordance with the facts. (Cheers and laughter.) I hope Mr. Fane uwill understand that I do not object in any way to his having written and published a letter giving frankly his opinion of me. He had a4 perfect right to do that, and, so far from entertaining any ill fesiling on the subject, I can assuLre him that his letter has been so useful to me in my canvass (cheers and laughter) that if he wil do nme the favour to send me a thousand copies I will pay the whole cost of
prusting thom, and shaU be glad to circulate them at my own expense. (Conttnued cheering, and laughter.) I need hardly tell you, gentlemen, that I do not intend to go into the Chinese question, for, upon my word, I have talked Eo much about it recently that I am heartily tired of it, and so
no doubt, are you. (Cries of " No, no 1" and cheers.) Wr. Pane said in his speech, that one of your late representatives voted for the Government, and the other against it, and he added, " both cannot be right." There is some truth in that (a laugh); but I want to know which of them he thinks was
right and which wrong, because we have not heard an inkling of his owD opinion upon the subject, and I am not certain that a candidate who, if elected, vill oppose Lord
Palhmerston is likel t aee with him upon the Chinese question. (Cheers, and a"Voice, " Come to the Rooshlan question.") Yes, I will come to the " Rooshian" question,
as you call it. (Laughter, in the midst of which the same voice was heard exclaiming, "Away with Herbert! Send him to Rooshia !") My kind friend here says, "Send him to Rooslha." I never was in "Rooshia" in my life; but there is ono place in which I have been-the House of Commons, and that Is where my friends will send me. (Cheers.) Ifr. Fane told you in that poetical description which he gave of the termination of the war, that I was turned out with the Aberdeen Government. Here I am sorry to say I cannot agree with him, because, so ESr from bemu turned out, I was promoted on that oo.
eason to * higher office. (Cheers.) IHe said likewie ihalIeWt Xhi Government of Lord Palmerton wrhen the

the other day, in the discussion which we had with respect to Sir John M lNeiU and Colonel Talloch-two most able and bonourable publio servants, who have been most unjustly treated (cheers-that when those gentlemen were sent to the Crimea sickess vas already at an end, our troops were improved, and all needful supplies were on the spot m suffi.
cient quantities. (Cheers.) Yet that is what Mr. Fan3 1 calls deserting Lord Palmerston at the worst period of the crisis. ("Who sent out the green coffee?") I hear somebody talking about green coffee. May I be permitted to remark that there are other things green besides coffee? (Laughter, and a Voice, " Yes, Lord Harry is
jolly green.") No, I cannot say Lord Henry is green. I I bave a great respect for my opponent. I have carried on this election with the utmost anxiety that it should be conducted in a spirit of good humour and fair play. I respece a young man who, prompted by an honourable ambition, aspires to a position of honour and usefulness, and not one word will proceed from me which shall be detrimental to his character. Gentlemen, I do not intend to say a word with regard to that fabrication about Odessa-that is dead and gole. Nor shall I speak to you about the charge of factious combination on the Chinese question, for all the balderdash on that subject has been blown to the winds. That which is most interesting to you is not what is Past, but what is future. (Cheers,) You know what I have done. My public life is before you ; it has been a rather stormy one. I have held situations of high trust, and a man so placed must expect a great deal of misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Of that I do not complain. I know that I have had some very sharp, active, and restless enemies; but I kuow also that I have many able friends, who have backed me with a zeal and determination which I shall never forget, and I almost rejoico that I have had enemies, because they have rallied round me such stanch friends. (Cheers, and cries of "Bravo!") Gentlemen, the question we have now to consider is how is the government of England to be conducted in future? Some people say that it must be conducted on the principle of stagnation-that we are always to stand still. ("No, no !") Observe how little that iS possible. You have heard Mr. Fane declare that he is for the big instead of the small loaf. Is that not a movement in advance? (Cheers.) I am not surprised at it, ior as we grow older we ought to grow wiser, and, with England enriching herself on every hand, becoming greater in honour, greater in strength, and greater in influence throughout the world, it is impossible for her people to remain stagnant and never to move onward. The thing is an absurdity. (Cheers.) But you ank me, what are those questions with respect to which we are to advance? War is happily over. Hostilities, it is true, are going on in a remote quarter of the globe, but they hardly deserve to be dignified with the name of war, and I am afraid we shall hear of them only when the Chancellor of the Exchequer presents his biUl for the ax. penses. (A. laugh.) We have returned to a state of peace, and that is the time for setting our House in order, and for the adoption of well-considered reforms. (Cheers.) Many reforms are required by the country. We stand in great need of law reform. I hope that not many of you have ever had the misfortune to go to law. If you have, I am certain that you are not now electors, whatever you may formerly have been, because, in litigation, you must have lost your qualification. (Cheers and laughter,) I also want to see our ecolesiastical courts put into better condition. (Hear, hear.) These are questions on which I entertain strong opinions, and I am sure you will not require me to remain silent upon them if you return me to Parliament. (Cheers.) They are questions, moreover, which any Government must deal with, and which I believe the present Administration, which has been redipped, as it were, in a general election, will come back with fresh vigour to encounter. Take another question-that of church-rates. There was a BiU before the last Parliament, which I do not think would have settled the question if it had remained there for 100 years. I refer to the measure introduced by Sir William Clay; that was a one-sided Bil. I think that if church-rates are extinct in large towns-which they are-the members of the
church have as good a right as any other class to spend their 1 own money in their own way, for their own purDoses, tbrough men elected by themselves. That seems to be just, but no such principle was contained in the Bill proposed by Sir William Clay. According to that measure there was no rate to be leviod, but the voluntary contributions of the parishioners, where there were any, were to be managed and expended by an independent body. I now come to a question which is one of great popular intercst-that of the franchise. A motion proposed by Mr. Lceke King in the lato session has made a great deal of noise, thougb, in my opinion, it was not a wellconsidered motion, and I shal tel you why. It dealt only with part of a whole, and if you take a part and not the whole, the dose will nto agree with you. Many of you have seen the prescriptions of a physician. They usualy conitain a long list of cabalistic phrases intended to represent the names of a variety of ingredients which when mixed neutralize each other. One of those ingredients may be a poison which, if swaUowed with the rest, will very likely accomplish some useful purpose ; but if you take it separately and alone you will probably be dead men in 24 hours. (A laugh.) So in the case of Mr. Locke ginc's motion ; it was only a part of a great question. I want to see other ingredients mixed with it. If you make the county and borough franchise the same you will disturb the balance between town and country. Such an arrangement would be unsatisfactory, because you might have 300 men in a borough wielding equal political power with 30,000 in a county, You must therefore, have different franchises. I wish to see an industrial franchise and a prudential franchise. I think a man who has 501. in the savings-bank ought to have a vote. (Cheers.) The man who paye 40s. of direct taxes ought also to be invested with the franchise, and all graduates of the Universities should have the same right conferred upon them. (Cheers.) I am against extreme measures-universal suffrage for example, which I believe no man of sense in the country now demands; bat with a large mass of our population inoreasing in intelUigence and prosperity-thanks to those wise measures of 1846 which our friends on the other side of the hustings so much regret (cheers)-I think we ought to enlarge the basis of representation. (Hear, hear.) But it should be done carefully and deliberatelv. With a great crowd to manage, I would much sooner have them inside the citadel to defend i' than outside to attack it; but I must pick my men. I must choose the more intelligent, the more industrious, the more prudent, and exclude the ignoraDt, the lazy, and the improvident. (Cheers.) I am afraid I am detaining you too long. (Cries of "N No I " and "Go on a ") Well, gentlemen, it has been said that the present Administration is more iemarkable for its foreign than its domestic policy. But we have all had a lesson at this general election. The Government and Parliament have, if I may repeat the expression, been redipped in a general election, and we shall come out, I hope, in good spirits, dotermined to press forward domestic reforms. With respect, however, to our foreign polcv, I think it ought to represent the national character. I do not thinkwe ought to inter,neddle in the affairs of other States. (Cheers.) No man has a stronger sympathy than I have with those abroad who are struggling for their liberties, but they must conquer them with their own right arms, and look for no support from us. We got or required no assstance at Runlymede when the Great Charter was extracted from King John. The French won their liberties when all Europe was banded against them; and I have no hesitation in saying that the people who have not the courage and self-sacrificing principle to ain their freedom will either nevergetit, or,iftheygetit, willneverkeepit. (Cheers.) We should not interfere, therefore, in the internal affairs of other countries, and we should show the same respect for their ribhts which we expecot them to evince for ours. (Cheers.) At the same time England must everywhere Inaintain her just rights and resent insult whenever it is offered. (Cheers.) Upon that we are all agreed, but I object to the system of meddling too much, threatening too much, and promising too much, and then not being able to perforn. (Cheers.) Gentlemen I shall make only one or two observations more, and tiey shall refer to what I believe will be the great subject of next sessionviz., the subject of retrenchment. During the war England distinguished herself by the cheerfulness with which she gave large sums for carrying on operations. I do not suppose that any nation ever bore such a weight of taxation before with such patient cheerfulness. There was one evil, however, which resulted from that expenditure -we borrowed money as well as raised it by taxation, and people who borrow money are always apt to fall into habits of extravagance-in fact, " easily got, easily gone" has passed into a proverbial expression. Daring the war, -when you would think every farthing would have been expended for military and naval purposes exclusively, we increased the civil estimates by a large sum, we built fine houses, and i were guilty of other imprudencies which I need not menItion. he time has arrived when we ounht to look into
these matters closely, and when we should have retrenchment, because without retrenchment there can be no relief from taxation. Next year there will be a decrease of about 5,500,0001. in the revenue of the country, and we must either cut down our expenditure or impose new taxes to that amount. Which will you have? (Cries of "No more taxes !" and " Reduce the expenditure !") I believe that a ! great deal can be done by careful and judicious re-
: trenchment; but I am not going to impair the efficiency of our army and navy. A large navy we must have-it is our igreat bulwark agaist foreign aggression; but it Is not !necessary that England should ve with foreign countries in the size of her army. We never have had, and I hope we never shall have, a large army in time of ueacc; but
our army, though small, should be as efficienbt snd`prfect in all branches as possible. For that purpose we should take caroe that every staff officer is thoroughly instructed in his duties; that appointments go by merit, not by favour; that the position of the private soldier is improved. Then our army, filled with strong and valiant Englishmen, and
led by the best and most gallant officers in the world, would
be invincible. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, I have only a few words to say in conclusion. (Cries of " Go on I" and cheers.) I have been told that among those electors of Wiltshire who intend to support me there are many who are "' smothering their consciences," and who are " devoid of intelligence.' (A la h.) We, gentlemen, I leave the matter in your hands. Yon know what wil be said of you if you vote for me, and you know from what quarter it comes. That I hope will be the antidote. (A laugh.) Gentlemen, I appeal with confidence from those who undervalue your intelligence and traduce your motives to the electors themselves, who have stood by me for 24 years, and who, I trst wM replace me in that position of honour which has always been the ambition of my life, and which I have done my utmost to make myself worthy to occupy. (Great cheering.)
Mr. WYDHAas next presented himself to the electors
and was received with cheers. He said that after the honourable manner in which they returned him at the last
election he felt that he should not be doing his duty if hi did not again offer himself to the electors as a candidate for their suffrages, He did so upon the same independent principles which ho professed in 1852, and to which he hadadheed during his Parliamentary ceer. He wa attached to

when he thought. they were in the right; when the country was under a cloud during the war he gave his best assistance to the Executive; and, finally, he supported Lord Palmerston in the vigorous prosecution of the war. (Cheers.) One of the charges brought against him was that he had followel too closely the lead of Mfr. Herbert. Now, no man could esteem rmore highly than himself the moral and intellectual worth of that right hon. gentleman, and he was always glad when their opinions happened to coincide; bht the division lists would show that they frequently differed, and frequently gave their votes in different lobbies. (Cheers.) He
iffered from his right hon. colleague on the Chinese question, because he considered that the papers laid before Parliament were not sufficient to justify the resolution of Mr. Cobden, and because he thought it was not right to pasa a vote of censure upon men placed in a difficult and reaponsible situation in a remote quarter of the globe without giving them an opportunity to defend themselves, and without being in possession of all the particulars of the case. (Cheers.) ;b:ould they again return him to Parliament, of which he had not the slightest doubt from the warm and frieadly manner in which he had been received during his canvass, he would continue to pay the same undivided and unremitting attention to his Parliamentary duties whieh he had hitherto given, and would he glad to support every measure, from whatever party, calculated to promote the peace and prosperity of the country. (Cheers.)
lord HsuRYv Tsrv9NN was greeted with a volley of cheers and hisses, in which the latter greatly preponderated. He said,-Electors of South Wilts, the gentlemen who have proposed and seconded the nomination of your late members seem to think that I have no right to stand in opposition to them, that I am not entitled to hold any opinions of my own, and that you, having elected Mr. Herbert and Mr. Wyndham before, are bound to do so again. (Cheers and hisses.) They wish to know why I come forward upon the present occasion. I shall tell them. I come forward at the request, conveyed to me some two years ago, of a large and influential body of the electors who are dissatisfied with the shifting policy and wavering principles of at least one of your representatives. (Cheers and hisses.) I declined to comply with their request in the first instance, because I wished them to apply to some older and more experienced man than myself; but, sooner than allow the county to go a-begging for a Conservative candidate, I consented to stand, and afford the electors an opportunity of recording their votes in my favour. (Cheers and hisses.) Gentlemen, I have been accused of disturbing the peace of the county, but I think the friends of Mr. Wyndham, at any rate, should be the last to make such a charge against me, because it was not till the last moment that that gentleman came forwa-d to oppose Mr. Long, the Conservative candidate, at the last election. (Cheers.) I have baen asked what difference there is between my prnciplees ad those of your late representatives. I should find it extremely difficult to say, for I am not aware what their prmciples are at the present moment. (Hisbes, laughter, and some cheers.) Objection is also taken to my youth; but surely those gentlemen who make that objection must be jokig, for they are the very men who 24 years ago elected
r. Hlerbert, when he had only just attained his majority; in fact, I believe he began his canvass before he had completed his 21st year. (A voice.-"Yes, but he had a head on his shoulders.") If Mr. Herbert s fit to represent you at 21 years of age, surely Iam able to do so at 2a. (Cheers, hises, and a cry of, "You are not so clever a chap as he was.") Gentlemen, I state in my address that Iam a firm supporter of the established church. It was with astonishment, therefore, that I heard in the course of my canvass in various parts of the county that Ihad been represented by the friends of Mr. Herbert in some quarters as a Puseyite, m some as a Romanist, in some as an infidel, and in others as a Methodist. (Laughter.) I can only say that I am a loyal member of the church of England as it is, and not as a good many wish to make it. (Cheers and hisses.) We have heard a good deal about retrenchment; but I think the first reduction should consist in the abolition of the Maynooth graut. ("Oh ! oh !" and cheers.) That granthas utterlyfailedin its object, and the RomanCatholics of Ireland having broken faith with us we are no longer bound to continue it. (" No Popery I" groans, and cheers.) With respeot to the question of church-rates, I cannot go so far as Mr. Herbert, who, in one of his speeches to the electors, talked of immediate and total repeal. I would scorn to endeavour to catch stray votes by pledging myself to what I never intended to perform. (Cheers, hisses, and great uproar.) I am fully aware of the great consideration which is due to so large and influential a bed of men as those who dissent from our churoh, and I feelgit is of the greatest importance that some measure should be framed which, on the one hand, should remove al heartburnings and dissensions, and, on the other, preserve intact the fabric of the church. (Cheers and a voice " What has your mother done at Frome ?") I think that in a matter of so much importance it is the duty of the Government to prepare and bring forward a measure which should remove the grievance, and I can only say that if you elect me, and if such a measure be proposed, it shal have my best sup. port.- (Cheers.) With respect to our foreign policy, I conceive it to be of the utmost importance that we should rot meddle with the affairs of other States or mix ourselves up with their quarrels. By following a different course we shall not acquire honour, but, on the contrary, shall derogate from the high position and consideration wbich Eng. land so deservedly enjoys among the nations of the world. (" Speak to us about Protection.") Protection I I thought the very name had long since expired. Every sensible man must see that the principles of free trade are firmly established in this country. (Cheers.) But I wish to have those principlas carried out stiUl further. I wish to see such articles of general consumption as tea and sugar made as cheap as possible. (Cheers.) In conclusion, gentlemen, I assure you that if elected one of vour representatives in the House of Commons nothing shail be wanting on my part to the proper discharge of my duties; every measure essential to the wellbeing of the country shall have my hearty support, and if I should happen to change my principles I shall re turn to you the trust you will have so generously placed in my hands, (Cheers and hisses.)
A show of hands was then taken for each of the candidates. Fully three-fourths of the persons present held up their hands for Mr. S. Herbert; nearly an equal number declared themselves in favour of Mr. Wyndham ; while a comparatively small number only appeared for Lord H. Thynne.
Mr. PniPPs, for Lord Henry Thynne, demanded a poll, which was ordered to take place on Saturday, between the hours of 8 and 5, at Salisbury, Warminster, Hindon, and Everley.
On the motion of Mr. HJLBBERT, seconded by Mfr. WYNDrAI, a vote of thanks wa. accorded to the High Sheriff; and three cheers having been given for the Queen the proceedings terminated.
SUTRREY (WEST).
The nomination of the candidates for the representation of this division of the county of Surrey in Parliament took place yesterday at the Town-hall, tnuildford.
The High Sheriff of the county presided.
Mr. J. W. EVxaYN, the late member, stood forward to propose Mr. Henry Dr-ummond.
Mr. G. BFsT seconded the nomination.
MIr. L STZZRX. proposed Mr. Henry Currie, and Colonel WoOD seconded the nomination.
Mxr. Briscoe was proposed by Colonel C TAToTwoNE, and seconded by Mr. RP A AUsTETN.
Mr. Dur.urmo.ND then stood forward to address the electors. He was received in a very cordial manner, the cheers being mingled with cries of " Adjourn," the Town-haU at this time being iniconveniently crowded. He consequently moved to a position nearer the centre of the hall, where his speech was but imperfectly heard by the reporters. He said they had been truly told that they wero met to perform an important duty-that of returning two members to Parliament; but as, on the present occasion, there were three candidates proposed, and they could only have two members, it was clear that they must make an April fool of one of them. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Now, on the present occasion he should say very little about himself. He was not going to praise himself, stil less was he going to decry others. If he was thought worthy of their srport by what he hadl done ho should be glad, but it certainly would not be by what he said of himself. It had been said that this dissolution had been brought about by a coalL tion. (Hear.) Coalition was a very ugly word. Some people said there was to be a coalition between the candidates at this election. Al he could say was that he had not coalesced with any one. (" Hear," and a laugh.) He wouldtoelthemthe reason why. When he was ayoung man he was very fond of hunting, but he invariably chose his own country. He never went through gaps that were made by other people. (A laugh.) In Parliament it was hopelessto
expect to please everybody. Therewere in Parliament a number of petty factions, but parties, as it appeared to him, there were none. The charge of coalition that was therafore made against the last Parliament was partly true and partly false. He believed that Mr. Cobden was actuated by sincere and honest motives in bringing forward the China question. Those who wanted to turn out the Govermnent did certaiLly coalesce witb a party known in the House of Commons as Peelites-a party that could make very good speeches, but in whom he (Mr. Drummond) placed no confidence, and bythismeans,no doubt, the motion was carried. He had felt it right to vote for the Government, and at the timo he did so he really thought that the vote would have been displeasing to his constituents. tA laugh.) Al he could say was that he
could not help itif it had been. He felt that he was doing what was rght. (gear, hear.) They must also understand that he did not go to Parliament upon the cry of " Palmerston for ever," for he thought that it was quite possible that in a few months he might bo cried down just as much as he was now cried up. (" Hear, hear," and a cry of "No, no." Mr. Drummond pro. ceeded to say that he considered Lord Paimerston a very clever, able man, and that during his public career he iad camieda great many important measures that other Ministers had declared themslves inompetent to contend with. As to his foreign policy, it wasa ve7 long story, and he should certainly nob go into It; but they would remember that some years ago another foul consoiracv was entered into to drive him from offlco upon his policy in Greece. 'Upon that occasion, however, he made out to the satisfaction of every one thbt he was in the rlght, and that what he had done was neoessy for the protection or British commerce, and to sustain the honoir of the, 6ountry and he (Mr. Drummnond) believed that it was the only policy that was calculated to keep foreign despots in-we. (Chees.L Wht did they go to war forupon the lut occasion? Why, beause othe'rtched PeeUt didAr t- dare to tell the Empceror of RP UALIat Uthy wroUld hot albwr him to aWtck}nd IiVeupoia Turkey. If'lie had sen

("Hear, bear," and a laugh.) They left the country withoat any Prime Minister, without any Foreign Secretary; in fact, without anyoneto carry on the Queen's Government; and in this state of thin5s Lord Palmerston accepted office, and had carried on the war with vigour and energy, and had at last obtained a better peace than any of his enemies eve r dreamt of obtaining. Hear, hear.) For these reasons he was willing to support Lord Palmerston; but it must bo suite undeistood that he would not undertake to support him in every measure that he might propose. With regard to retrenchment, he thought there was a good deal of force in the observations of Mr. Gladstone upon the subject; and so far as he (Mr. Drummond) was concerned he should cerlainly eupport reasonable reduction of expenditure; but be would never consent to any proposition that was calanlated to impair in the slightest degree the efficiency of the army or navy. He did not think so much of the alliance over the water as some people did, and he thought it was one that might be dissolved every hour, and therefore he -would never consent to any proposition in the shape of reduction of expenditure that might have the effect of impairing the efficiency of those services upon which alone we ought to depend for our protection in the event of any emergency arising. (Hear, hear.) He should oppose the expenditure of large sums of money for suc buildings as the palace at Westminster and the barracks at Aldershott. Princes thought very little of 100,0001. a-year, and they saw no reason why Governments should not give them all they asked for. It -was the duty, however, of tho House of Commons to support tIeGovernmentagainstthis sort of claims. In aU these matters he had taken his own line, and he should do so again; if they thought he had done them a service let them return him, and, if not, leb them reject him; but if they did return him he could asure them that he should continue to persevere in the same course he had hitherto taken. (Cheers.)
Mr. CuRRIZ next addressed the electors. He said he should not answer the personal observations that had been made respecting him by some of the gentlemen who had addressed the electors, and, indeed, he thought that the observations they had made had done him some service. It had been said that he did not possess the proper qualifications to represent the county, but this, it appeared to him was a &uestion for the electors to decide, and he was quite content to leave it in their hands (hear, hear) ; and as to what Mr. Austen thought about him he did not care at all about that, so long as the electors returned him. (A laugh.) The question had been asked what was meant by a Liberal Conservative, which he professed to be. What he meant by being a Liberal Conservative was that he would support the Crown, the Protestant religion, and all the other old established institutions of the country. (A cry of " What about the franchise' ") Well, as to the franchise, he was of opinion that, as the education and inteDigence of tho people increased, their political riets ought aso to be
tended, and he was prepared togoÂ° forward inthat direction. (Cheers.) With regard to MIr. Locke King's motion for a lOl. franchise in counties, he thought the principle was right, but he also thought the amount ought to be raised to 201. When he was in Parliament and tho qnestion was bronght forward he did not vote, although he thought there was something good in the proposition. (A. laugh.) It might be said, perhaps, that this was no answer at all, but, what he meant to say was that he thought 201. was the pror amount, and this was tho amount fixed by Lord John Russell. He was, however, rather disposed to vote for the 101. qualification, but it must be understood that he did not pledge himself to do so. He felt called upon to state his opinion that Lord Palmerston expressed the views of a ilberal Conservative better than any other man at the present moment, and so long as he continued to carry out those views and bring forward measures caloulated for the benefit of the country he should have his support. (Cheersl He also was of opinion that the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston rendered him deserving of the eonfidence of the country, and that every Englishman ought to be proud of him. (Hear.) When they reeollected what the commereo of England was, and that our flag was flying on every sea, it was impossible not to feel that it eould only be proteoted by such plucky conduct as had been adopte by ord Palmerston. ("Hear, hear," and cheers.) They were happily now at peace, and the Government would be able to direct its attention to the great social questions that affected the country; and he believed that the subject of finance would be one of the first that would be brought forward. He should feel it to be his duty to support economy and retrenchment to the greatest possible extent consistent with keeping up the proper force for the Protection of the country. With regard to the question of church-rates, he said it appeared to bim that it was the duty of the Government to introduce some measure upon the subject, and that no private member was qualifiod to do so. (A cry of "What do you say about religions liberty and the admission of Jews to Parliament?") The answer that he had to give to this question was that he had voted five times against the admission of Jews to Parliament, and he should do so again if elected. ("Oh, oh," and expression of disapprobation.) Mr. Currie then expressed his opinion that there should be a reform in the law, and he said that what had recently talken place in connexion with the unfortunate British Bank was a proof how necessary it wDS that something should be done in this respect. He coneluded by refen-ing to some of the other pointsmentioned in his address to the electors, and said that if they did him the honour to elect him as their representative he would use his utmost exertions to advance the interests of his constituents and of the country at largo. (Cheers.)
Mr. BRIsco then addressed the electors. Ie was received in a very enthusiastie manner. He said he regretted most sincerely that any personalities had been introduced on the present occasion, and he could onl say, for his own past, that at every meeting he had attenued, and on every occasion when he had met the electors, he had studiously refrained from making any observations that might be considered of a personal character; and he believed that both of his honourable opponents had done the same. (Hear, bear.) He did not come before them on the present occasion as a man whose political prindples were unknown. He had been three times returned by that oounty and once by another county, and had sat in four Parliaments; that anyone who took an interest inpublie affairs must be aware of the course he had adopted. If he was returned as their ropresentative on the present occasion he should support Lord Palmerston, but at the same time he would not be the blind follower of any man. (Hear, hear.) This was not the first time that he had come forward to avow Liberal prindiples. He had supported the Governments of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne, but he had always done so independently, and his supprt would never he given to any Government upon other terms. (Cheers.) Every one of the candidates on the p resent occasion expressed himself asupporter of Lord Palmerston; and he believed there was harly a man in the country who did not consider that he was indebted to him for the manner in which be had conducted the late war, or who thought that anyone else was so well able to support the honour of the country. (Cheers.) With regard to the reduction of taxation and the expenditure of the country, it had always been his opinion that industry was taxed too much and property too little. FSo.me one in the crowd here called out " What is your opinion of the malt-taxi"] He could not in the present state of the financesof the country vote forthe repeaof the malttax, and thus entail so serious a loss of revenue upon the Government as v,000,000. a-year, He could not consent to be returned to Parliament as their representative with his hands tied, and unless he aeted independentlyas MÂ§r. Drummond did, it would be impossible to perform his duty in a satisfactory manner. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the extension of the franchise, he had no hesitation in saying, from his own personal observation and inquiries made in the large towns of the county, that a vast number of respectable intelligent persons were altagether unrepresented because they did not hi1l pen to pay oOI. a-year rent; and he should certainly therefore support Mr. Locke ling's proposition for a 101. county franchise. (Hear, hear.) le had been asked in the c3urse of his canvass whether he would support a 51. franchise; and to this he replied, certainly not. He believed that Lord Palmerston would not refuse the 101. franchise; and if he did he (Mr. Briscoe) certainly should not vote with him. (Cheers.) He believed however, that now he had an opportunity LordPalmerston would show himself equally competent to carry out his do. mestic policy in accordance with the wishes of the people, as he had that which related to foreign affairs. (Hear, hear.) [Some one here said, "What do you think of the ballot?"] At present he should not vote for the ballot, but he would not vote against it. Mr. Briscoe then stated, in answer to a question put by one of the electors, that he should voto for the aission of the Jews to PariHament, and he said that he felt himself justified by the precepts of tho Bible in taking that course, and that in doing so he was performing a Christian duty. (Cheers.)
A show of hands was then taken, which was declared to be in favour of Mr. Briscoe and Mr. Drummond.
A poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. Currie, which was fixed to take place on Saturday; and after a vote of thanks had been passed to the High Sheriff the proceedings terminated.

He said he rejocecd once more to have the opportunity of returning to them his earnest and hearty thsnkt for the honour they had now for the third time conferred upon him. (Applause.) There were somo pc'nts upon which he ought to addres; them, affecating as they did the policy and honour of the British empire. One of those was the conrse taken by the First Minister of the Crownn in sppealing to tho country. They all knew that seven months ago we were at peace with China; that we were carrying on an amicable intercourse with that country-with that barbarous and unenlightened people. But war had sinoe saupervened, and we had destroyed shios, houses, dwelling places, forts, villages-in fact, wo had burnt and destroyed what he had mentioned, and which were now lying smoking in ruins. FA Voice.-" Why did not they burn Odessal"] Why, indeed, did they not burn Odessa? He woula answer that question. Because the Government of this country wero then waging war against a great and powerful nation. (Cheers.) Butnow they were raging war with feeble unresisting men. It was the great imisfortune in the policy of our country, it was the great blot on the national name and fame of this country, that, while we submitted to indignity from a great and powerful nation, if oar fleets and army under the control of the present Ministers came into conflict with a weak and powerless and unresistine people, then, and then only, did we show our power. We were at peace with China, but the Governor of Hongkong, desirous to gratify his personal vanity, wanted to enter the city of Canton, and he sought for a pretext to gratify his vanity. Sir John Bowring, the representativo of British truth, the representative of British honour, the representative of British power, had condescended to the falsehood of representing that the Arrowr was a British vesseL Then was it that they had bombarded the city of Canton, putting to death tens of thousands-helpless men, women, and children-not only by tens of thousands but by twenties of thousands. (Great cheering.) And that was the act of the British Government. In the vote he (Sir F. Kelly) gave in the Honse of Commons he aenounced this act as the act of barbarilans and as an act disgraceful to the name of the British nation. (Renewed applause.) They had been acengod of being parties to the degradation of their country. But he would ask them whether that party to which he belonged was likely to have become parties to a faotious vote to put an end to an Administration which they had frrmly and unflinchingly supported in all acts which were necessary to maintain the Crown and honour of the country? But there wrere some questions of greater moment to them than any question of right or wrong on the part of Sir J. Bowring in this matter. Among the questions that had arisen were those that afected the finances of this country. He must say that he entirely differed from the present Mnisters of the Crown as to the whole scheme and compass and compositon of their financial statement. ("Bravo l") He wo2l not hesitate in saying that the Ministry now in power had broken faith wvth the nation in respeoct to tho income-tax. (Loud cheers.) After describing that tho income-tax was first imposed during the 25 years of war with .France, and tracing its progress from that time, he proceeded to allude to the motion he had made in the House of Commons for the purpose of gettng rid of the extra two. pence in the pound, upon which he was unsuccessful, and observed that as he should again have the honour of re. presenting their interests in the Honse of Commons, he would, session after session, renew his motion in order to compel the Ministers to fall back on the compact of 1853. (Applause.) The tax on tea and sugar was the next question introduced by the hon. gentleman, and on which he spoke at some length. He said that upon that question he differed altogether from his hon. colleagne (Lord Henniker). He and those who acted with him (Sir F. Kelly) were al prepared topay those increased taxes so long as the war continied. Bat he had found that if any persons opposed those taxes they were the Radical members of the House of Commons. (Laughter.) Mr. Gladstone had made a motion to restore the taxes to a graduated scale, and he much lamented that his noble friend (Lord Henniker) had felt it to be his duty to oppDos that motion. (Hear, hear.) With hardly a single exception, the great body of the Conservative members unmted m support of that motion. He cared not whether he was addressing Conservatives, Whigg, or Radieals; he was addressing Englishmen (applause), and he would ask them whether that tax on sugar and tea did not fall eanullY heavy on the rich and the poor ? (Rear, Mear
Was then, le would ask them, the war tax to be continued in a time of peaee? ("No l") How ould, then, never cease in urging upon the Government and the House of Commons the absolate and imperative duty of putting an end to that portion of our system of taxation. (Cheers.) He thought that they would find the Ministry under Lord Palmerston a Ministry of extravagance, while they would find in an Opposition Ministry a Ministry of retrenchment. (Cheers.) He would now come to the question of what was termed reform in Parliament. He was one who had always thought there should be no *' finality" in what was eaUoed the reform in Parliament. (Cheers.) There were now some millions of adult persons in this country who did not possess the elective franehise (cheears), and among them were hundreds of thousands of persons of independent incomes-persons possessed of competenee, of intellect, and education, which would do honour to any seciety. (Hear, hear.) He would at onee confer the franchise on rsons of property, of intelleet, and education. (Cheers He would support any statesman in the House of Commons who would introduce a measure th t would give the franchise to such persons as he had spoken of. Ho would, sooner or later, bring forward such a measure in the House of Commons under which every man in the three kingdoms should be put in possession of the elective franchise wlho possessed either properTyenough, or intellect or education enougk, to exercisethat elective franchise with independence and intelligence. (Applause.) Then would het e time to extend the franchise downwards. But let them not suppose that he would oppose the extension of the franchise stll further among the householders in this county. He said he would not first begin with the householders, as he considered that a mogt falacious test. He much questioned whether his hon. friend Lord Henniker would possess tho franchise had' he not large property in the county, because his Lordship, when in London, might live in lodgings, or in a furnished house, or in chambers. They might have a Newton, or a Shakespeare unpossessed of the elective franchise because he might not happen to live in a 101. house within any borough. (Cheers.) He would therefore confer the franchise first upon those persons he had mentioned; then he would at once secure the franchise to those persons who unquestionably were fit to exercisoit. (A Voice.-"How abont the ballot?") He beheved that the Parliament now about to .ssemble would find it impossible to exclude the consideration of that question. And as regarded the principles which he had just now ventured to enunciate to them, And upon which he should act if it should be his good fortune to appear as a candidate for their suffrages on any ftunre oaeasion, they would not have to complain of him that he had not endeavoured to see them carried out. He should look with confidence to their approbation and future support on that .son every other political quesffioa which they might trust him to deal with in theoHouseof Commons. (A Voice:-" The ballot.") Afterreferring to the part he had taken in lawreform in the late session of Parliament, niaking more especially allusion to the consolidation of the statutes, reform of the ecclesiastical courts, and to the registration and the transfer of titles to lands, by which an immense saving had been and would be effecoted to the people of this county, and which would be a remedy against the long and expensive biUls of the lawyers (1aughter),9 he proceeded to say that he thought it was hardly necessary for him to observe, as this was the eighth or ninth time he had appe%red before them, that he was deeply attached to the religion of the established church. With regard to Maynooth, he was now satisfied (notwithstanding he had voted in favour of the grant) that e should be guilty of no breach of faithif he attempted once and for ever to put an end to it. In conclusion Sir F. Kelly said he would once more thank them for the confidence theyhad againreposed inhim. Hewouldtry todo his duty by them in all things to the best of his ability; and, whether he should again hereafter appear before them and solicit their suffrages, or whether he should occupy some diflerent situation from that which their kindness had allotted him, he trusted that he should ever adhere to those sacred principles of eternal truth and justice-and therefore of unerring policy-which they had vindicatod
e ngain selecting him as their representative. (Much c eermgA.),,,
Lord xN B proposed, and Sir F. KxLLY seconded, a vote of thanks to the High Sheriff for the courtesy and kindness evinced by him on the present occasion.
The proceedings closed by three cheers being given for Lord I)erby and the High Sheriff.'
WARWI SHIRE (SOUTH).
The nomination for the southern division of this county took place at the Shire-hall, Warwick, yesterday mornino.
The Hon; C. B. PERCY nominated Mr.EvPlhn hihlip
ohirley; Mr. w. Urxnes, Chairman of Quarter Sessions, seconded the nomination; Sir FB_CIS SHnuc-
BURGH nominated Mr. Edward Bolton King, who he said was no Radical, but a Whig Conservative; Mr. 3lLsx PnBILPs seconded the nomination.
There being no other candidate the HIGE SsEEiF- declared Mr. Shirley and Mr. King duly elected.
Mr. SmRLXY expressed his gratitude to them for having a second time returned him to Parliament. Three years ago he promised them that though on one side he was a Conservative he would be no party man. He had endeavoured to take a liberal -iew of politics in general, and had given an independent support to the present Government. He regetted, howeter, that he could not doso io a n,bacanse hedid not believe anything that was morally wrong could bepolitically right, and he believed a more conscientious vote lad never been given in the House than thatL upon the Chinese question. Mr. Shirley then adverted to the subject of eduoation, saying that ke should not support any yastem separated from relf-
g Asto theMaynooth grant, hevoted with Mr.Spooner, M use, though he did not think it wrong to give money to Roman Catholics for the purpese of education, he looked upon that at Maynooth as inefficient, and it would be botter that printe should be educated in foreign countries, In eoncluaion, he said he would rather be tested by his principles than by his adhieson to any Minister or satesman.
Mr. KING retUrnea thanks. He ad stated in his address that, if elected, he should feel himeslf perfectly independent of aUl parties and unpledgedl to any pArticular line ef co

DORSBT.
The nomination for this county took place on Taesdav Much interest seemed to be felt in the proceedings, audua large crowd of electors was present.
MIr. R. K. Seymer was nominated by Mr. FARQusARsom, and seconded by Sir E. BARER,
Mdr. FRASPToN nominated Mr. John Foyer, and Mr. TYLXR seconded the nomination.
M5r. RADCLYPEz proposed, and Mr. CLAVXL MONSEL seconded, the nomination of Mr. Gerald Sturt.
Mr. STRANGAVAYS proposed, aud Mxr. Gui,'DRY seconded, the nonmination of the Hon. Mr. Portman.
Mr. KER SEYMER addressed the electors amid frequent interruptions. After referring nt great length to the weakness of the claims which Mr.. Portman possessed upon the suffxages of the electors, and vindicating his vote against the Government on the Chinese question, Mr. Seymer addressed himself at length to the subject of church-rates, which he upheld. In reference to education, he 'would ask the hon. Liberal candidate if he was ready to support a sch ol-rate; because as it had been eatisfactorily shown in the case of a school established on religion7s grounds only in MLasachusetts, which school had sunk into a purely secular one, that such would be the issue of any educatioi.al plan supported by a rate, while acknowledging the value of education to the people, he was not prepared to support a school-rate. He highly respected the voluntary priniple of Disaenterg, and was prepared to stand by the existing laws in reference to the ob. servance of the Lord's Day. He had, accordingly, sup. yorted Lord R. Grosvenor's motion against the desecration of the Sabbath. Be wished to see places of recreation closed during Sunday, but could not objeet, on the gronud of health, to pent-up inechani's availing themselves of fresh air trips on that day. As to the support of Protestantism as enunciated m the address of hs hon. opponent, to which he had so frequently referred, he fancied Ireland was the place where Protestantism needed the su port of champions, but Lord Palmerston there sought for Roman Catholics to fill every vacancy. (A Voice-" It's a Catholic country.") He therefore was unprepared to support the Premier in this, though he (Mr. Seymer) would uphold the proper maintenance of the establishment. He was a sincere friend to the repeal of the malt-tax, and would, if re-edected, try to reform the exctravagant habits the House of Commons wvas falling into upon fiscal questions. He conceived the greatest good that could be done to the agricultural interest wrould be to leave
Mr. JOHN FrovY was welcomed with some applause. He said this was the fourth time he had the honour of appearing before them (AVoice-"Going, going, gone l" to ask a renewal of that trust which for the last 11 years hey had been pleased to repose in him. He had not claimed the position of their representative, but requisitionists, whose influence he did not feel at liberty to oppose, had first asked his acceptance of the office. Mr. Floyer expounded his political views at some length, but mainly they were as detailed by tbe preceding candidate. He met with a good deal of interraption in the course of his address, and frequent ejaculations such as, when explaining his view vof -the Sabbath question, " Would'nt you like to go foxhunting " and, when declaring that every vote given for him would be without intimidation, "H ark at the lamb !'I
MIr. H. G. STuRT addressed the meeting next, and in a very good-humoured vein, happily rebutting whatever observations came from the crowd. His political tenets were akhn to those of Messrs. Seymer and Floyer. He was frequently applauded.
The Hon. W. H. B. PonitAiH next addressed the meeting, which received him with continued applause. After expressing his entire concurrence in Lord Palmerston's policy on the Chinese question, he said, the party which voted against tho Government indignantly disclaimed the idea of a coalition. But in the extract from a letter written by a person of whom they had all heard, a certain Major Beresford, better know as "W. B.," whose attachment to LordDerby's party they were well aware of, were to be found theso expressions:-" Iu the first place, I don't like the company which youhave lately been keeping or endeavouring to keep. (LAughter and applause.) I will not enter into a controversy as to whether it is a coalition or an agreement, or an approximation; I don't like your company. It must bring discredit, and will bring bad principles with it. In the next place, I foresee and fear very distrous results to our military position at Canton, and to our national prcstige, if a resolution of the House of Commons should go out repudiating the conduct of our forces there. Further, I must look at the consequences of such a vote in its results here at home. A change of Government is unavoidable, nay, ou acknowledge that such is the object in view." (ear, hear.) Well, gentlemen, I think that establish the fact of a coalition. With reference to his political opinions, Mr. Portman professed himself a Liberal. He was not ashamed to express himself strongly in favour of the Maynooth grant. His views on church-rates were that tho preseat system pressed heavily on a large portion of the community whose religious opinions were not in accordance with the establishment they were compelled to support, and he should therefore support any just scheme which provided for the maintenance of the fabric of the church. After referring at length to the attempt of the Conservative members to monopolize tlhe representation of the county-an attempt which he was sure would be defeated on the present occasion-he concluded by promising that if returned he would faithfally and honestly discharge to the utmost of his ability his duty as their representative.
On a show of hands being taken,
The SssEsu declared it to be in favour of Mfr. Portman, Mr. Sturt, and Mr. Flover.
A poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. Seymer, which was xed for to-morrow (Friday).
A vote of thanks to the High Sheriff terminated the proceedings.
SOMERSET (WEST).
The election of two knights to serve in Parliament for the western division of Somerset took place yesterday at Taun. ton, Sir A. H. Elton, M.P., High Sheriff, presiding. In
spite of frequent rumours to the contrary, the prediction of 2ie Tinmes a few days since that there would be no opposition offered to the retura of Mesr Moody and LangtonL was fully verified.
The two candidates having been proposed and seconded,
and no third candidate having been nomin%ted, the Sherifr declared Mr. C. A. 3oody and Mr. W. H. P. Gore Langton duly elected.
Mr. MOODY addressed his constituents in vindication of his recent vote on the Chinese question. He said, one of two courses was open to Lord Palmerston, either to give au
his office as Prime Minister, and throw unn our beloved Queen, in the delicate andinteresting state in which she is, the harassing responsibility of forming out of discordant material a new Administration, or of dissolving Parlia, ment; and as a man of firmness to his Sovereign, and justified as he was by all the eircumstances, he chose the latter alternative. (Cheers.)
MIr. GORE LASGTON also addressed the meeting, but was very impatiently heard.
The proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to the Sheriff, and three cheers for the Queen.
WESTMIOBLANTID.
The Westmoreland election took place on Tuesday at the Shire-hall in Appleby
Mr. HAsELr, of saleinain, moved, and Mr. Hn,4 of Castle-bank, Appleby, seconded the re-election of Colonel Lowther.
Mir. G. E. WiwoN, of Dallam-tower, and Admiral WILSON, of Troutbeck, moved and seconded respectively the re-election of Lord Bective.
Mr. ATKIUSON of Winderwath, moved the election of Mr. Thwaites, (hairmsn of the Metropolitan Board of Works, a gentleman born in the county, and one who had raised himself from a humble station to a position the most influential; -Mr. G. Wmr so.ir, of Appleby, seconded the nomination.
The show of hands was pretty nearly equal for aU the candidates, but the HIGH SHERIFF ruled that it was in favour of the two old representatives and declared them duly elected. After a moment's pause, hlr. ATnSOa
demanded a poll, but was told by Colonel LowT'rsR he was too late. A scene of considerable uproar ensued, and Mr. AT'rISsoN declared he had only followed the proceedings at Carlisle.
Colone LOWTr then addressed the electors and defended his Chinese vote. He alse bore testimony to the vigour of Lord Palmerston in the conduct of the Russian war, and declared if the noble lord had stated his intention to send out a commissioner like Lord Elgin to arrange mat.. ters with the Emperor of China he woud not have votelf with Mr. Cobden. He also referred to the ticket-of-leave system.
Lord BzcTrIv also condemned in strong terms the precl. pitancy of Sir John Bowing, and dwelt on the duty of retrenchment. As for reform, they could not hope for reform from a Tory head of a Eiberdw Cabine, as the Premier had been designAted by Mfr. Disraei.
A vote ot thankcsto the High Sheriff; moved and seconded by the newly elected members, closed the proceedings.
YORKSHIRE (NORTH RIDING OF).
The nomination of 4ndidates for the North Riding of Yorkshire took place in the Castle-yrd, York, on Tesday last.
Sir C, WoXsvgi nominated Mr. E. S. Cayley; and Mr. OuTHWAI seconded the nomination.
Mr. J. B. S. Monnrrr proposed the Hon. Colonel Dauncombe, which was seconded by Mr. H. B,. 1rsx
The third candidate, the Hon. J. 0. Dundas, wa nominaed by Mr. WyvmL, Sir W. x. E. 3MPi;m aonding the nomination.
Mr. Cvra then addressed the electors. Reverting t@ the opposition which hadbengot Up aginst his return, he observed that Mr. Dundasad come forward inresponse to a requisitioN, and had he (Mr. Caley) been in his Poitibn he shosud probably have acted, u had done.

returning a representative (hear, hear), but he told them to their faces they could not do it. (Cheers.) The inde. pendents were a great majority in the riding, but the Whigs were but a small faction. He had been accused of votin with Conservative Governments; but he had supported al
the Liberal Governments also, 'when their measures were those which he deemed advizable, and it was only then that he supported Mlr. Disraeli or Lord Derby. He sup. mtrtduMr. Disraeli's budget, and a better budget was never
nroued. (IIOh, oh I") He, however, opposed Mr. Disraeli on the question of the Vienna Conferences, because his langnuage was so ambiguous and uncertain. He had supporteo Lora Palmnerston, and it was his influence that secured the Turkish loans, the refusal of which would have perilled our alliance with Frauce. He had also supported the Government on the Chinese question. Hte asked them if they sent him to Parliament to represent half-a-dozen famnilies I (" No, no !") He had always represented them, and he had always been on their side. He had obtained none of the good things of office like bis opponent, who was Lord-Lieutenant of the Orkneys. In conclusion, he urged them to place him at the head of the poll.
The Hon. Colonel Du.NcomsE then addressed the electors. Some dissatisfaction had been expressed at his vote against the Government on the Chinese question, but he voted in accordance with his conscienco, and in a manner which be believed the country would ultimately justify. He would support Lord Palierston if he proposed good measures, but nt otherwise. He was opposed tovote by ballotand to the totew abolition of the church-rates
The Hon. J. C. DUNDAS next addressed the electors, and repudiated the suggestion that he had been put forward by the large Wihig families of the North Riding. He had come forward in obedience to a requisition signed by ICO most respectable men in the riding. He should support Lord yannerston, and considered he acted properly in supporting our officers in distant climes. He was opposed to churoh. rates, and would support the ballot and an extension of the franchise.
The show of hands was in favour of Colonel Dancombe and MSr. Dundas, and a poll was demanded for Mr. Cayley, Vhich will take place on Saturday, and the declaration wil be made on Monday next.
GLAMORGAN (COUNTY).
The nomination took place at Bridgend on Tuesday.
The late member, Mr. R. C. MX Talbot, was nominated by Dr. NICHOL CARNE, of Cardiff, and seconded by MIr. L. L. DILLWYN, MP. for Swansea.
Mr. WALTERC CoFFIN, the late representative for Cardiff, proposed Mr. Hussey Vivian, who was seconded by Mr. G.
The Conservative candidate, Mr. Nasb Vaughan Edwards Vaughan, was thea proposed by Mr. CRANvSHAY BAILEY MLP. Mr. HOWEL GEORGE, the late member for Falmouth: eeconded the nomination.
The several candidates then addressed the electors. The Liberal candidates both expressed themselves in favour of the ballot, a larIo extension of the suaage, the abolition of church-rates, an alU measures of reform tending to the great cause of civil and religiousliberty. On the Chinese question Ar. Vivian expressed his satisfaction entirelvy wth the course pursued by Government. Mr. Talbot did not go so far, although as a matter of policy he refrained from voting for Mr. Cobden's motion.
Mr. VAUGHAN said, he was no Tory. His hon. opponents found fault with him because he would not permit the epithet *' Old Tor7 " to be pinned on his back. He was a iAberal Conservative. He was opposed to the ballot. He considered the Church as much entitled to her rates as the landed proprietor to his estates. (Hisses, and cries of " Sit down!") The system of secret voting would demoralize the people. England was a free nation. (A Voice.-" It will Dewphen you give us the ballot.") And coercion would be exercised as much then as it was said it was exercised now. (" No, no !" and matksof general disapprobation.)
The show of hands by an immense mlajority was deciared to be in favour of the Liberal candidates. A poU was dexmanded for Mr. Vaughan, and fixed for Friday. Tho greatest excitement prevailed.
CARMARTHENSHIRE.
There has been no contest for this county. The late members, Mr. D. S. Davies and Mr. D. Jones, were reelected on Tuesday.
Mr. Davies was proposed by Sir J. MANSELL, and seconded by MIr. R. G. TiaomAs.
Mr. Jones was proposed by Mr. PON'ELL, and seconded by Mr. W. PEEL.
Mr. S. DAVIES, in a speech of some length, referred to his past conduct and future intentions in Parliament. On the Chinese question he affirmed that originally his intention was to support Lord Palmerston, but he was convinced by the arguments used on the other side, and he never gave a more conscientious vote in his life. But had Lord Palmerston intimated to the House that he would do what he had since done-namely, send out a plonipotentiary, he (Lord Palmerston) would not only have obtained his vote, but have secured a large majority.
Mr. D. JONES, having apologized for his frequent absence from his Parliansentary duties in consequence of serious iUness, proceeded at once to the considerahon of the Chinese question, upon whioh alone he and his hon. colleague had arrived at aifferent conclusions. Had the House come to a division on the Friday night his (Mr. Jones's) name would have been found in the list of the majority, but. by an extraordinary coincidence, he had on the following Sunday rebeived a letter from his friend, Sir - Nicholson, lying off Shanghai, which at once satisfied him that Sir John Bowring had pursued the right course. It would be a great pleasure to him to aid in establishing a system of education under which the children of Churchmen and Dissenters could be simultaneously educated.
The usual formalities having been gone through the meet. lug dispersed.
LANCASHIRE (SOUTH).
The election for South Lancashire tookplaceyesterday at Newton-le- Willows.
Mr. THOM1As BAZLEY proposod Mr. William Brown for re-election, and Mr. WIL-IAM RATHBONE seconded the miotion.
Mr. TiioNIAs BROCKLEBAN I moved, and Mr. Alderman NEILD seconded, the nomination of Mr. John Cheetham, one of their late members.
Mr. JosEPzm STONME, of Ormskirk, nominated Mr. John Bright, but the object of the speaker was apparently only to get an opportunity of attacking Mr. Brown.
The third nomination not being seconded, the HwiGi SHERiFF declared Mr. Brown and Mr. Cheetham elected.
Mr. BROwN was received with loud cheering. He begged to make the strongest expression of his gratitude to this constituency for returning him a fourth time as their representative. (Applause.) when he first entered Parliament he was dravwn unexpectedly from private life by tihose who knew hi in tobeadevoteddiscinle of free trade principles, and it was no little gratification to him to see his anticipations of their results so completely verified as they were now acknovwledged to be in the general prosperity of the country. (Hear, hear.) After pointing out the benefits derived from free trade, he said the Russian war had been an unfortunate episode in our history, but not without advantages, for the Emperor of Russia had discovered that commerce was power. He was now introdaciog railways, and though he mightlbecomonmorepowerful bycivilizing his people, he would probably become more peaceful, for he would have the evidence of his own subjects against him that peace was better than war. (Hear, bear.)He regretted that Government 'ad not earler done justice to the Crimean commissioners. (Applause.) He was gladto find that the Persian war was at an end, and that r larendon and Mr. Dallas had been able to make such a settlement of our dispute with America as promised, despite some small differences yet existing which were not of much moment, many years of prospenty and happiness in our intercourse with our greatest castomer. (Applauso.) He was rather an advocate for the income-tax so far as it could be carried out with justice to other intexests. He was an economist so far as economy could be reasonably carried, and desirous to keep downl the expenditure; but members of Parliament had very little control over the voting of the estimates, and must place a great deal of confidence in the Government. As to the Liverpool town dues, he waa a freeman, and bound to support them until they were by law found ilegal, and he left the question to be decided by those who took an active part on the question. (Hear, hear.) He had voted for Mr. Locke King's motion and for the ballot, and was in favour of the grant to Maynooth. He desired to see the ecclesiastical courts aboished. He had supported the budget, because he believed it was impossible to got rid of the war expenses all at once. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. (CiHETHAIM w as loudly cheered. He was glad to see so obvious a fulfilment of his anticipations from the operaticu of free trade, in its benefit to the landed interest as well as the commercial, and to find the question set at rest. All his attention to. the subject of taxation had more deeply convinced him that the principle of direct taxation up to a certain point was a sound position on which to stand. (Hear, hear.) Muob, therefore, as he saw in the public mind at the present time of dissatisfaction, even with the very existence of the income-tax, he must say candidly that he would advocate, if the question came under discussion in Parliament, direct taxation in preference to iedirect taxation, for the avowed purnose of relieving the labour of the country and extending our comimerce. (Applause.) Helhad deeply deplored the necessity of war, but he believed that so long as society existed in its present state, and the world remained as it was, there was
no otber chance of preserving order b ut the necessary use of that force which would alone sustain it. He quite approved the measures which Lord Palmerstfon took for the reduction of the income-tax, but it appeared to him that the amount of 19,000,000!. or 20,000,000t. to maintain our naval and istary armam ents might safely be reduced. (Hear, hear.) He had, therefore, voted against the budget, but not in favour of the motion of Mr. Disraell. As to the China question, having carefully read all the documeents relating to it, be came to the conclusion that the proceedings at Canton were not justified. He wvihed to disabuse his Liverpool friends of the idea that his course on the town-dues question was influenced by his residence near Manchester. lie had viewed that question as the representative of South Lancashire and its commerce generally. (Loud applause.)
A vote of thanks to the Sheriff was carried by wcelama. tion, and the proceedings terminated.

Heexpressed himself an advocate for a return to transportation, and for a sweep)ing reform of the ecclesiastical court- and such an amehoration of the law of marriage as wouid protct the property of wives from brutal husbands and put an end to achons of crim. con.

The two hon. gentlemen were most favourably received, and the whole affair passed off in a very quiet manner.

The election of a knight of the shire for t'his county took placeat Edinburgh on'It'esday. There was no opposition to the re-election of the Earl of Dalkeith.
Mr. TRorTTR, of Morton-hall, moved that the Earl of Dalkeith was a fit and proper person to represent the county; and Mr. SADLER, farmer, seconded the nomination.
The SHERiFF, having taken a show of hands, declared the noble lord duly elected.
The Earl of D.uTTn} then addressed the eleotors, He said that his vote against Government on the Chinese question was not given from any factious motives, but because he be]ieved the ciroumstances of the case were such as to warrant and require it, He waved altogether the disputed question of the lorcha, but he held that Sir John Bowrin' had acted precipitately and exceeded his authority in eWtering upon the war without consttlting the authorities at home. He also complained that extreme measures had been resorted to vithout adequate means. While, however, condemning the conduct of our representatives in China, he should give his firm support to the Government in crying on the wiar to a successful termination, trusting that the result woutld be to establish our commercial relations with that coumtry on a more hasting basis than at presert.
The proceedings excited little interest.
ABERDEEN.
The nomination of candidates took place at Aberdeen on Tuesday. There was an immense concourse of people present, and the respective candidates were accompanied to the hustings by a large number of their friends.
Mr. ALEXANDER NICOL proposed Colonel Sykes as a straightforward, honest, and independent candidate. (Cheers and hisses.)
Baillie HENDERSON seconded the nomination.
Mr. NEIL Smrrn proposed Mr. John Fairley Leith. Mr. Leith was a born townsman, and as such hada claim on their suffrages. (Cheers and hisses.)
Mr. WiLmAm YmLvrs seconded the nomination.
Colonel SYKES, on presenting himself, was received with mingled cheers and hisses. He was thesame man now that he was when he appeared before them 10 years ago. Before coming to Aberdeen at all he had taken part in public matters. He assisted in getting the window duties abolished. He told the Chancellor of the Exchequer long ag
in language which he was not acoustomed to hear, that it was a sin and a crime to tax the light of Heaven. (Cheers.) He assaisted to get the duty off bricks. (Hear.) He had assied to promote the education of the poor, in money and person and he had endeavoured to get adut classes e8tablished in meehanics' institutions throughout the country, and he was Chairman of the Sooiety of Arts. (Cheers.) But to go to another question. It was of great importance that there should be an Indian element in the House of Commons. He (Colonel Sykes) had served with the Indian army in three campaigns in thefield, andhadbeen selected bytheEast Indian Government to make important inquiries (A Voice, -"Well paid for it.") No, very badly paid indeed. (Cheers.) For 40 years he had been connected with India, andformany years with its legislative department; and surely that gave him a higher claim on their confidence in that department of legislation than his hon. friend who opposed him. (Cheers.) To turn to another topic. His priciple was that, as the public revenue was made up of taxes from all classes of the community, it was unfair to tax any one portion of the people for the support of the religion of another portion. That was his gener principle
but there was no general rule without ali exception, and sometimes the exception proved the rule. So it was in this case. It was found expedient for the public good that a grant of some 30,0001. should be made to Maynooth, and he was there to maintain that it had served that end. But when he was asked if he would vote against it should it be the wish of the majority of his constituents that he should do so, he was prepared to do it (hisses and cheers), on the principle that he was not called on to set up hi own judgment in any matters of a religious character when tbe majority were against him. As to foreign affairs he would say little. There was only one element of discord-that of China. He hoped they were in a fair way to get quit of that, and then he hoped that God would grant them a lasting peace.
Mr. LrI was received with much cheering, and also addressed the electors. He was for progressive reform and retrenchment-administrative reform, educational reform, and social reform. He looked upon education as the basis of alL
The SnEBiFs then took a show of hands, and declared that it was in favour, by a small majority, of Mtr. Leith.
A poll was demanded for Colonel S)kes.

PEEBLES (COUNTY).
The nomination and election of a member of Parliament for the county of PeeWles took place on Tuesday in the county town.
Mr. D. Dicxsoy proposed Sir Graham Montgomery, the late member, for re-election; and Mr. R. TOD seconded the nomination.
No other candidatehaving been proposed Sir Graham was declared duly elected.
Sir G. Mo,ruGomERY then addressed the electors; and, alluding to the disasters consequent on the Crimnean expedition, remarked that it was but justice to Lord Palmerston to say that the vigour of his administration had rescued us from the mismanagement of the. first period of the contest. As regarded the unfortunate hostilities with China, having been detained from his place in Parliament at the time of the division, he had not voted upon the question; but it appeared to him that the sending out of Lord Elgin to China to supersede Sir John Bowning was a complete justification of the vote which the majority of the House of Commons gave upon that occasion. At the same time he highly approved the course taken by the Government in sending out a plenipotentiary of the large experience and known ability of Lord Elgin, and in making provision by the despatch of troops for the protection of British interests and the lives of British subjects at Canton. Had such a course been followed sooner no division adverse to the Government would have taken place. Probably there would have been a division, but the Government would have carried it by a large majority. He hoped the result of the special mission might be a cessation of hostilities for the present, and the establishment of closer commercial relations with the Chinese for the future.
K=RKCUDBRIGHT (STEWARTRY).
The nomination took place on Taesday in the ancient town of Kirkcudbright.
The nomination of Mr. James Mackie, of Ernespie, was made by Dr. CowN, of DildawYn, and seconded by Provost MARTIN, of Castle Douglas.
fr. George Maxwell, of Glenlee, was proposed by Mr. NEH.SON, or Queenshil1, and secondedhby MIr. MoFi;, of Bore-
Mr. MIAcnIz addressed the electors, stating that his prin. ciples were Liberal, but not so extreme as those of his oDponent. Were he returned of which he expressed grest confidence his voice would be entirely for the stewartry, whereas his opponent would be chiefly for Liverpool. He was for peace, but not at any price; and wished the honour of the country maintained. He approved Lord Pal;uersten's foreign policy, and hoped the Chinese war would be soon settled, that we might enter upon a career of progressive improvement. He Was in favour of opening up the parochial schools, and opposed to the Maynooth endowment.
Mr. MAiWELL also declared himself a Liberal, but not an extreme man. He would reform with energy, not with violence. He supportedperfect religious liberty. He had been and was a steady and earnest advocate of free trade. He also was in favour of peace, but not at aU hazards. He would advocate reduced taxation and administrative reform. He congratulated the country on the admirable selection Lord 1Ealmerston had made in appointing Lord Elzin to the Chinese mission. Hewished to see the parochial schools supported and the salaries of the teachers increased.
A show of hands having been taken it was declaredto be in favour of Mr. Mackie. Mr. MaxweU demanded a poll.
The contest promises to be a very keen one, and there is great excitement throughout the stewartry.
FIFE (COU.NTY).
The nomination for the county of Fife took place on Tuesday at 1 o'clock.
The SHERIFr having mado the usual preliminary inti. mations,
3Mr. CHnirsaY, of Durie, nominated Mr. Fergus, the former member; and Mr. BxTrnuux, of Blebo, seconded the nomination.
Mr. WrDDERB1uJNE, of Birk-bill, then nominated Lord Loughborough; and Mr. LANDAL seconded the nomination.
The SfizsiF, having then called for a show of hands for each candidate declared it to bein favour of Mr. Fergos, and Lord Lougnborough's proposer declining to demand a poll Mr. Fergnx was declared duly elected.
Mr. FERGUS then briefly addressed the electors, and thanked them for having returned him for the third time as their representative. IIe appealed to his lengthened and consistent career ss a Liberal, and repudiated the designa. tion " Liberal-Conservative," donned by the noble lord as a Conservative hook, baited with Liberal opinions, to gull the public.
Lord LoUGlIBOROUGH vinadicated himself from the per. sonalitiee of Mr. Fergus, and stated that his sole reason for mot going to the poll was that he did not consider that the amount of support which he had received, large though it was, justified bun in so doing. He expressed his readiness,
whenever the constituency thought fit to call for him, t
come forward again in support of Liberal-Conservative opinions. (Cheer)

believed iucerely there had been no coalition to overturn the Government on that qaestion. In giving his vote on Mr. Cobden's motion, he did not mean it to be a vote of want of confidence in Her MajestyWs Government. If it had been put in that form he would have voted against it, because he did not blame the Government, but those who had, wlihout authority from the Government at home, unwarrantably plunged the country into war. He Admired Iord Palmerston for the manly and generous way in which he had stood up in defence of an absent servantbut it was possible to push so good a principle too far; and if it were carried to the length to which it had been carried by Lord Palmerston on this occasion, we had so large a numnber of representatives in every part of the world that we might at any moment be involved in a serious wat by the ndiscretion of any of our representativos in foreign parts Lord Palmerston, by the course he had since taken, had shown that he did not consider that the affairs of China wZere inasatisfactory state; and if he had proposed to Parliament, at the outset, to do what he was doing now, viz., seuding out a plenipotentiaryof Lord Elgin's experience and sagacity, no adlverse vote would have been possible.

this cry on tho present occasion was a mistake, and that 'when the British public had found time for calm reflection they would affirm the verdict which the majority of the ElouEe of Commons bad pronounced. He certainly did not go the length of holding up the Chinese as a virtuous and benevolent people, as had been done by some members of Parliament. He believed them to be semi-barbarians, savage and insolent; but, even supposing they were such, it was neither the policy nor the duty of a country lio Great Britain to behava to savages in any other way than according to the rules of justice and fair play. But now that we were, so to speak, at war with China, he had no wish nor intention to cripple the bands of Government in this matter. SirM. S. Stewartconcluded by declaring himself a friend to army reform, retrenchment, and administrative reform.
Mr. J. W'GREGoR, of Paisley, then questioned the hon. representative on vote by ballot, houeehold suffr~age, the JlOZ. suffiage in counties, and other matters.
Sir MICHA:L declared that he was not preparedto vote for either of these three measures.
The proceedings then terminated.
BANFFSHIRP.
The nomination of candidates took place in Banff on Monday. There was a large attendance at the hustirgs.
Major GORDON, of Park, proposed the late member, now the Earl of Fife, to again represent the county. c
hMr. W. GARDNER seconded the nomination.
There being no other candidate the SHERIFF declared the Earl of Fife to be duly elected.
The Earl of Fxxx was received with much cheering. After referring to his past services as their representative for nearly 20 years, he said the only real question now before the country was the maintenance of the national honour and confidence in Lord Palnmerston, (Cheers.) Ili Government, which he thought, both as to its foreign and domestic poicy, deserved the support of the country, had found itself, by a most extrmordinary combination of parties, in a minority, and had, he thought, wiesly determined not to throw up the reins of power, but to appeal to the country for its verdict. (Cheers. Apart from the merits of the questionwhich had led to the present crisis, Lord Palmerston was a linister who had fairly earned the gratitude and support of his country, and ought not to be displaced to make room for the men who, after having deserted his Government at a time when the diffisulties of the war were at their height, and after having done their utmost to impede his efforts to bring that war to an honourable conclusion, were now graping at the reins of Rower. (Cheers.) The nation wa not disposed, at the bidding of tctio us o'diee-seekers Ifke Mr. Gladstone and Sir James Graham, to allow his hands to be crippled and his power destroyed, at the very time when, thanks to his land determination, they were beginning to reap the benefits of the peace which these qualities had procured for them. (Great cheering.) --
SELKIRK (COUNT).
The nomination of a member for Selkirkshire took place in front of the Town-hal, Selkirk, on Tuesday. The former member was unoppoEed.
The usual preliminaries having been gone through,
Major ScoTT, of Gala, nominated Mr. A. E. Lockhart as a fit and proper person to represent the county; and Mr. MITCHELL, of Newhouse, seconded the nomination.
The SHERIT then declared AIr. A. B. Lockhart to he duly returned.
Mur. LOCKHABT addressed the electors, and than;ked them very sincerely for the honour they had done him, and declared himself to be still a follower of the line of policy inaugurated by the late Sir Robert PeeL In reference to the vote he had given on the Chinese question, he had only to say that he voted against Lord Palmerston from a purely conscientious motive, and not from any factious op tion. In reference to the 40s. freehold, he said that sofas he could und?erstand it, he did not think that it would have the effect in Scotland which its advocates believe. (He-r, hear.)
A vote of thanks to the Sheriff closed the proceedings.
AYT. (COUJNTY).
Tho nomination of candidates to represent the county of Ayr in Parliament took place on Tuesday at Ayr in front of the county buildings. There was a large assemblage present, and Sir James Fergusson, the late member, and Lord James Stuart were accompanied to the platform by a number of their respective supporters.
Sheriff CansnlsoN having read the writ,
Mr. GRAHA&x Rumssu moved, and hMr. MErmmxn:um seconded, that Sir James Fergusson was a fit and proper person to represent the county in Parliament.
Sir JmES MONT,ITH seconded by Captain BLARn, nominated Lord James Stuart.
Sir J. FERGUssoN, on presenting himself, was received with cheers and groan After referring to his former election, which took place when he was in the Crimea, he said, their choice on that occasion was an evidence that they approved the devotion of an offioer to the service of his country abroad, and that they had every confidence that he would return as soon as honour and a sense of duty to his country permitted him to take the place to which he had been elected. (Cheers.) The question which had been the occasion of the disolution of Parliament had undergone a total change since the division took place. If the Government bad done that which they had since done-sent out a Minister in whom the country had confidence-there would not have been any adverse vote. In so far as it was necessary to maintain British interests in China he would give Lord Palmerston his independent support. He would yield to no man in a desire to maintain the honour of the British flag, but he could not but look upon that cry from his opponents in any other light than a partymovement. There was not the slightest foundation, in fact, about the British flag being tarnisbed. (Hiear hear.) He proceeded to aualyze the political career of Lord Palmerston during the last 30 years, associated as his Lordship had been with every form of government during that period, and contended that if there was anything wanting to deprive Lord Palmerston of the confidence of the country it was the manncr in which he had justified that Chinese quarrel. (Groans and cheers.)
Lord J. STUART then addressed the electors, and stated that he held the same views which he advocated when he represented the Ayr Burghs in Parliament.
The SHERIFF having called for a show of handS the great majority was held up in favour of Lord James Stuart, and the sheriff declared accordingly.
A poll was demanded onbehalf of Sir J. Pergusson, and was fixed to take place on Thursday (this day)
A vote o f thanks was given to the Sheriff by acclamation, and the multitude dispersed.
CLACEMANNAN AND KINROSS.
The election of a member to represent these combined counties took place on Tuesday at Dollar.
Mr. W. P. ADAM, of Blairadam, proposed that Viscoant Melgund was a fit and proper person to represent the county. He said that his Lordship came before them as a supporter of Lord Palmerston's Government; but it would be his duty, and that of every Liberal member, to keep Lord Palmerston up to the mark in liberal measures.
Captain Cimiss}E, of HIllend, seconded the nomination. No other candidato being proposed, Sheriff T.uT declared Lord Melgund duly elected.
Lord MELGUND then addressed the electors, and e pressed his desire to promote a conciliatory policy towards Ireland as well as in oar colonial government. Ee then referred to the late war, remarking that we must not forget that Russia was met in the field, not only by the constitutional Powers of England and Sardinia, but by the despotic Power of France, and to some extent by the military Power of Austria, both of which were endeavouring. so far as they could, to suppress the cause of liberty. There were still independent States in Europe, and with those, he thought, our best alliances might be formed. There was Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, and Sardinia; and if any attempt was made to filch the liberties of these countries from them it was the business of England to hold by the free States rasher than with those of a despotic tendency. After expressing his wish to have a national measure of education for Scotland on the basis of the Lord AdvocaWs Bills, he expressed his gratificationat the return of Lord JohnRuc ell as hopeful for the cause of reform.

THE PENDING ELECTIONS.
MmDTa?AEy
Ameetingof the electors of Middlesexwas held yesterday, at 2 o'clock, at the Angel Inn, Edmonton, to hear an addres
from Viscount Chesea, the Conservative candidate. About 100 electors were in attendance. Mr. W. Cobbett, of the Firs, Edmonton, was called to the chair, and was supported by Mr. A. P. F. C. Somerset, BLr. R. C. B Bowles, Mr. B. N. Fowler, Mr. T. Knight, Mr. R. B. Smith, Dr. Firminger, Mr. G. Ellis, Mr. J. J. Austin, &c.
Viscount CHElSEA said that it gave him great pleasure to meet so many influential electors of that part of the county. It was a custom-more honoured as he thought in the breach than in the observance-for a candidate to allude to the ob. jections which he thougnt the electors might find to his opponents before he brought under their notice what he had to say for himself; that, however, had not been his practice,forhe thoughtthatwhateveramountofmudhemight bespatter uponhis opponents wonldnot makehim awhitmore clean, and he wished to say nothing that might be thought to bear hardly upon them. (Applause.) Lord R. Grosvenor had been their representative for many years; his conduct had been before them, and it was not necegary to dwell upon his claims; but Mr. Hanbury was now before them for the first time as a candidate for their suifrages, and he certainly offered to such electors as were very advanced Liberals opinions quite congenial with their own. Mr. Hanbury said in his address that he was surprised to see one so young as himself selected to contest the representation of the metropolitan county. He confessed that he aso was surprised that a gentleman who was prepared to endorse the most out and out radical doctrines, and who was ready, in fact, to swallow every nostrum of the Radical pharmacopmeia, should be brought forward as the noble lord's colleague for Middleeex. (Hear, hear.) One of the questions which had in the city of London excited a good deal of attention was the admission of the Jews to Parliament. On more than one occasion he had, when in Parliament, voted against the admission of the Jews to the Legislature, and he should continue to give his opposition to such a measure. (Applause.) No one subject created in his mind such a painftl conflict of feeling as in being compelled by his strong and unalterable convictions to vote against claims which, if he consulted his private feeling;, he should feel inclined to favour. It was impossible to become acquainted with the Jews without feeling respect for their energy, ability, and philanthropy and also for the patience, perEeverance, and courage wmth which for centuries they had endured persecution and clung to their own interpretation of their faith. Upon no question, therefore, was he more strongly tempted to make his solemn convictions yield to his personal feelings than upon this. Thero were, however, many reasons why he felt constrained to oppoee the claimsof the Jews. Itwasnotsufficient to say that under present circumstanoes only three or four Jews would belikely tobe admitted members of the Honse of Cemxions, and that it was impozsible that they could exercise any appreciable influence on our legislation. He felt bound to consider also that circumstances might possibly arise which might be accompanied by a vast increase in the power, wealth, and influence of the Jewish persuasion; and the question was whether, if they obtained such a number of seats as would make their influence felt upon the Legislature, that influence would not be exercised against the Christian faith. Now, of all the religious sects in this country, none were more honest and determined in upholding their own principles than the Jews, and he had never met one whodeclared that, if he had the opportunity of inflicting a serious injury upon the Christian faith, or of preventing its spread, he would fail to do so. (Hear.) In expressing these views he knew he was exposing himself to the most determined opposition of the Jewish persuasion; and it was, therefore, rather hard if his opponent were to present himself to successive bodies of the electors and to gve the go-by to a question which eAtailed upon him (vi soount Chelsea) much opposition and some misrepresentation. (Hear.) He had, therefore, the right to ask that the test which he had not evaded should also be fairly and fully pul to his political opponent. (Applause.) He had been charged with being a rank Tory of the old school. It was 'AOW many years since the word Tory could be said fairly to describe the opinions of any one. He came into Parliament in 1841, when Sir R. Peel was Prime MEnister, and he had never lent his hand to any measure to curtail the political privileges of any men or set of men in the kingdom, but had, on the contrary, voted for measures some of which had given important relief in regard to taxation, while others had effected important improvements in our institutions. With respect to his vote upon the China debate, he could sincerely say that he had goneinto the lobby against the Government, not from any desire either to compel the Government to resign, or to induce them to appeal to the country. He would give the same vote over again, for it was a question upon which he felt bound to give an honest and conscientious vote without regard to politics. If the electors of Middlesex thonht that he was pre,ared to enter into an improper combination or coaUtion agaist the honour of the country he should feel it his duty to enter into a defence of his conduct, but as that did not a p,pear to be the case, he should content himself with saying that if the Government had announced that they were grepared to do what it appeared they had already determined upon doing-viz., to send out Lord Elgin, baked by a large military force,-he, for one, would most certainly have voted in their favour upon Mr. Cobden's resolution. (Applause.) Another question closely connected with the hostilties in China, and our foreign policy generally, was thatof taxation. Assoon as the new Parlr'ent met it would be necessary to take this subject in hand, and to enforce upon the Government zhe necessity of equalizing the expenditure and of economizing and retrenching when they could do so without injury to our great establishments. (Hear, hear.) It would also be desirable to establish such relations with foreign countries as to justify us in looking forward to a long continuauce of peace. (Hear, hear.) The country would be caled upon in 1860 to give up 6,000,0001. of revenue on the expiration of the income-tax, and it would be necessary to provide some substitute for that tax, unless the expenditure could be diminished to that extent. He was very much afraid that, unless some alteration took place in Lord Palmerston's foreign policy, we should be ere that time involved agein in such difficulties with foreign countries that it would be impossible to extricate ourselves unless at the expense of great sacrifices. (Hear, henr) There had already been an immense falling off in the import of tea in consequence of the dispute with China, and this must at once entail a severe loss of revenue and enhance the price of tea, thereby abridging the comforts of the humbler classes of the country.
(Applause.) lith regard to reform of the representation, eenedthat it couldbe justly said of the Conservative party, of which he was A member, that they were adverse to all reform and all extension of the frauchise. He demurred to the justice of Lord J. Russell's definition at the Guildhall, on Monday,of the difference between a Conservative and a LiberaL He would rather say that the Conservatives would not consent to change unless they had fair grounds for believing that change would be an improvement, while the Liberals were content to accept any change, and to take their chance whether that change would prove to be an improvement or not. (Applause.' He should be prepared to consider any reform of the representation under the guidance of the Conservative principle which he had just expressed. If they did him the honour to elect him, he sbould be ready to give up his whole time to their service. It took their late representative five years to find out that the duties of a Government official were not compatible with the representation of the great and important constituency of Middlesex. He was aware of the fact, but there was this difference between Mr. Osborne and himself, that while Mr. Osborne had come to the conclusion that it was his duty to give up the constituency rather than his offlce, he (Viscount Chelsea) should come to a conclasion directly the opposite, for if his party came into power and should offer him-w hich was very improbable-a situation in the Government, he should surrender, not the constituency, but the office. if he found tha two things incompatible. The noble Viscount resumed his seat am%idthe applause of the meeting.
Mir. THomPSoN 3aid there were many el6ctors who would be glad to hear Lord Chelsea's opinion upon church-rates.
V'iscount CQuSRms said he was not satisied with the present state of the law. He had voted against the immediate abolition of church-rates without some provision for keeping the fabric of the church in repair. (Applause.) He thought that, without a rate, some provision might be made for keeping the church in repair in poor rural districts, the congregation paying for anyt comforts and conveniences which they might require. Applause.)
M{r. THO3IrSON, who was stated to be a Liberal, said he should give Lord Chelsea one veot.
31r. B. N. Fowu then moved a reeolutiou pledging the meeting to support Lord Chelses, which was seconded by 3Mtr. R. B. SmiTH, and carried with onlyone or two dissentients.
The proceedings terminated with the usual compliment to the chair.
DERBYSHIRE (SOUTHI).
A curious correspondence has taken place between Mr. Colvile, one of the candidates for Sonth Derbyshire, ani
the Earl of Harrington, with referenF to a letter whi.s the noble Earl was understood to have addressed to one of the electors.
Mr. Colvile enclosed a copy of the letter to Lord Hirrington, with a request that he would state whether or not he had addressed it to a MIr. Briggs, of Melbourne. The letter was as follows:-
" Dear Sir,-My x4n, Lord Peteraham, caled upon your sen yester. day to solict his Tote and interest on behalf of my relatire, Lord Stn. hope, and Mr. C1owes, but be found your aw bad no vote.

Mr. COLVmLE again returned to the charge in a note addressed to his Lordship, in which he stated that there could bo no doubt of the existence of the letter to which he had called his attention, and asked him to state distinctly whether or not such a letter, or one to the same purport, was writt-n to 3Mr. Briggs, either by hi, Lordship or by any member of his family, or with his Lordship's knowledge and sanction. This brought an answer from the noble Earl, in which he says;-
" I did not write the letter of which you sentune, a yon sa, the copy, and I never saw or sanctioned it. I decline further oorepondence on the xnbject, I hzre no farLher explanation to gise."
- So in the original.
BERKSHIRE.
The contest for this county promises to be a severe one, and as only two days intervene between the day of the poll and the announcement of an opposition to the return of the three gentlemen who originally came forward, great exertions are being mado on behalf of the respoctive candidates. It appears that in certain parts of the county the electors have taken umbrage at what they consider an unauthorized transfer of a Conservative seat to a Liberal candidate ; they think that on the withdrawal of Lord Barrington Mr. Bouverie was brought forward in consequence of a compromise, and they are determind to sapport the three C-onservative candidates. On the other hand,. there is another party which is resolved, if posdble, to return a Liberal member. Row the contest will be decided it is very difficult to predict, as up to Monday, as there was no opposition, there was no canvassing, and the fact of there having been no poll since 1846 renders conjectur stlll more uncertain. It is rnmoured also that the register 1S not a very safe gide, in consequence of the manner in wfhich it has been kept, and, if this be so, the issue is still more doubtful. It is admitted on all hands that the return of Mr. Palmer is secure, and the contsst therefore lies betwfeen Mr. Vansithtrt, Mr. Bonverie, aa.d Captain Vernon.
FLINTSHIE
The only county contest in North Wales will be that for Flintshire, wvhich is expected to be a severe struggle betvween the Eon. T. E. Mostyn and Sir Stephen Glynne. The latter gentleman is wfarmly supported by MAr. Gladstone (brother-in-lawr to the hon. baronet), who has relntive.ng quite a tour of the county in favour of his rea rv . 3r Gladstone has been to Rthyl, Mold, Flint, and Holywell, at all of which places he delivered addresses to the electors in favour of: Sir Stephen. Both parties have been busily engaged csnvassing up to the last, and a sharp contest will take place oig the day of polling (Saturday).

Yesterday a numerous meeting of the friends of Mr Monsell and Mr. Devereux was held in this city. Mr Monsell was present and addressed the electors, expreSEing himself confident of the success of himself and Mr. Devereus.
A very numerous meeting of the friends of Mr. Adair, tho tenant-right and Opposition candidate, was held in the afternoon, when a resolution was adopted withdrawing Ir. Adair. There will therefore be no contest.
KMKiZicy (COuNTY).-Serjesnt Shee's prospects are said to be brightening. A local Conservative paper states that on Sunday last the learned gentleman addressed a meeting of his friends and supporters in Thomastown. He has since had interviews with the Roman Catholic bishop and several of the priests, and from the nature of the reception he has met with it becomes evident that his position in the candidature is by no means so hopeless as had been generally supposed. The southern portion of the county is stated to bo very favourable towards him, and there the voters are likely to split for him and Captsin Ellis as largely as for Captain Greene. In the northern part of the county, however, priestly influence is strongly against him, and there the voters who favour Greene v,ill split, some for Ellis, others for Mostyn. From another account, however, it appears that at a great meeting of the electors held on Saturday the Hon. Mr. Mostyn and Captain Greene, the late member, were declared to be the favourites.
LnuiERic (CouiiTY')-Mr. GeorgeJohn Adair, the indernde.nt r Opposition candidate, having applied to Mr. Smith UlBrisn forthat gentleman's vote and support, received a reply from which the following is an extract:-
" I must frankly tel you that i I were an elector it would give me the greatest pain to Tota against eilther ot the late members. With both of thtm I am.connectod by famii ties ; with both of them I bLve eWoyeed tho pleasure of an intimate friendship Since their boyhood; and both of them evinced much symrpabytowards me and my family during my exile. I am bound also to say. that tbough their views of the nation policy differ from mine, I bilerse tbem to be honourable and conscientious men. Could they feel it consbtent with their Tiews to act in Paliatment as members of the Irisb Opposition, there are no two men in the nation for whose retura Ishould feel disposed to mske 3ore Etrenuoos exertionL Haying said thus much in explanation otmyposilion with reference So the late memberp, ISeel It to be due to you t) add that you present yourself tS this oounty under circumstances which command, to a croat txtent, mypoUticsuixnmpathies. You appear a , an independent nationalist, prepared Sot as a member of the Irish Oppositooc, in support of the national interest of Ireland, ra!her than as an adhere,t of any of the great Englisah poltical part, and I have every reason to beUeTe that your opinions have not been influenced by the deilre of obtaining a seat in Parliament. You were a member ot the Irish Oouncil, a body which oonsistod of Irish gentlemen of different opinions who applied themselves with great ssiduity during the years 13i7-1848 to the coeslderation of measum by which the fatia conequences of the faiure of the potsto crop might have been averted. You also came forward tS bear honourable testimony in favour of my friend Mr. Charles G. Dunly at a time when his life or his liberty was in peril. You will not beconsidered by anyclassof society in this cOUntry as an adventurer for it is generaUy known that you are a- independent in perownl circumstances, as I tesnt, you are sinoer In the advocaoy of popular dights. My friends exaggerate my influence in this oountyb but, as it is possible that some of the tenantry on our estates desire to consult my w*ihesg, yn re authori7ed to say tolbhem on my part, what I have already said to eseeral in private communications, that I leve them to the oonsoientious exercise oo their own unbiarsed convictin. The onlyrequestthatI havetosoake1athat tbeywill giTe theirvotesin favour of the candidates whom they prefer, without puttlog the can Lidates to the expense of one shiiUng."
A large body of the priests, headed by the renowned Archdeacon Yitzgerald, have pronounced in favour of Mr. Adair, and agaiqst their old friends5 Messrs. MonseU and De Vere.
;IAYo (Ca7Jbry).-Mr. Alexander lan7beri.7 one of the m-oost popular of the Liberal gentry in the county, has given ug 1Udisgust his7 intention of contesting the representation. The unnatural s'oalition betwveen Captain Palmer and fr. George HIenry oore has fairly, or rather unfairly, driven Mxr. Lambert from the field. One of the local papers announcesthiton Monday Mr. Moorearrived in Castlebhr, where the horses were removed from his carriage, and he was drawn by the people. After parading the town he addressed those aseemiUled from the drawing-room windows of Dr.
t'Greal, enlightenimg shis auditory on the progress of " Independent Opposition" and the demolition of the " Sadeirit pledgebreakers as a gang of yolitical vilains and thieves." Hfo then launched forth into a furious tirade of invective against Colonel Onseloy Higgins. Mr. Moore concluded his speech by giving his reasons for proposing Captain Palmer as his colleague in Parliament, and solemnly declared his resolve never to enter Parliament as the colleague of Colonel Higgins, for if he were returned he (Mr. Moore) would resign his seat, and seek the sufErages of some other constituency.
510GO (BOROUGH).-A Ministerial ioss has been in a measure sustained by tho unexpected retirement from the contest of Mr. John Ball, who sat in the last Parliament for the county of Sligo, and who, having no chance of re-election in that quarter, sought a seat, first in tho city of Waterford, and secondly in the immaculate borough of Sligo. It is plainly intimated in Mr. Ball's retiring address that he foregoes his expectations of being member for Shigo, because he will net consent to secure the position by a rerort to corrupt practices
'- Circmmetanoe haVe," he ys, " oDme to my knowledge which satisfy me that I could not without a racrice ot my own puinciples succeed in shaing the Dosition which I had thought an object of legitimate ambition. It is with tho deepest regret that I withdr,sw from the preeent contest, and posibly, at the same Uime, from publc Iffe, but I feel that no choice is ocen to me."

At the nominationIobtained in unprecedented majority, and a poll being demanded for Mr. Brocklehur,bt which was appointed for the following day, I had a conference with my committee, when it was rinanimimously agreed that rm1ier all the circumstanoes, well known to them, it would be-better for me to retire from tha contest.
I assented, and my agent immediately oommunicated my determined not to go to the poll to the town-clerek and othtrs directly interested, and 1 returned to Louth the same evening.

LOWDON, THUURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1857.
How mnuch depends upon a name ! Call a man .c a political adventurer" and you have done for him. A pious horror rises at the very word in the breasts of r espectable funded or landed proprietors. They begin to think of revolution, disorganization, and agrarian laws; or, if they think themselves safe from such outrages, it is only to exchange -alarm for disgust. What a low fellow must a poli-
tical advoenturer be,-a man w ho has no political pedigree, no titledeeds, no rolls, and who " does not " write himself ' Armijrerv' in auy bill, warrant, " quittance, or obligation !" The namiie carries with it (ipsy associations to them, an odour of booths, of fairs, of what is called " low life," and of 3al those scenes in which dark-looking men with long hair are seen penetrating through- the mystery of this sublunary system, and taking steps for getting their poor share of the general scramble. How can wle trust a political adventurer ? l How -can we a('liit a political adventurer into power? The very idea is scouted, ancl nobody has a word to cay for hini. But now give this dlog another nauie. Say that he is a man of imagination and fire, that from the moment he was born lie has been full of the idea of political emiueuice, and thait just as one man's darling idol is to write a great poem, and another's to be a scholar or a divine, so liis dream iB to be a sttesnumn. Call his career not one of " adventure," but of " romaiice." Well, your man of ftnded or landed property is not very fond of romance either, but still there is a change for the better. Roomance is, at any rate, a drawing-room word, there is no odour of booths about it, it is a pretty word, it is rather a fragrant word. The early youth of this discilJe of romance is devoted to the composition of vehement and furious novels, which breathe the most perfect adoration of his chosen idol. Political station and eminence, the company of leading men, the lofty official 'World-all these sublime head-quIarters are worshipped with an extravagant poetry, as if they hardly belonged to this world, but carried us to the genuine society of Olymppls. The idea of residing at the mysterious source of huiman events and arraugements-of being actually close to the miainspring of the vast machinleof being behind the great curtain, and being the equal of great men, creates ecstaoy and raptnre. The hero of one of these novels almost expires with delight, and the wvhole fabric of his mind is in imnminent danger of dissolution on finding himself made an UTnder-Secretary of State. Whlen he gets out of bed the next morning the first thing he does is to look at himself in the glass, and say, " I am an Under-Secretary -" of State." All this was great nonsense, and was laughed at uncommonly; still it was the nonsense of romance rather than of sordid " adven" ture," which is generally more sober and cautious. And, therefore, when this ardent and ecstatic novelist turns in course of time a veritable statesman -when he shows the world the very reverse of what -was the conimon thing said about him,-that it was the politician that had been the novelist, and not the novelist that had turned politician; wh6n at one bound, and without going through any of the prelminary drudgery and imposed silence, good behaviour, and schloolboy discipline of inferior office, he leaps to the very highest office next to that of Premier,-when he finds himself at the head of the landed interest and leading one side of the House of Commons, the landed initerest may regard him as a " political "a adventurer," and apologize for having such a champion; but it may also be said that he is fulfilling a dream of romance, and realizing in fact the visionary idol of his imaginative youth. We say no more than what is true when we say that very few 'nen who have let out to the world what their idol wvas, and especially who chose a very difficulti and apparently uanattainable one, havo found themselves more completely realizing their vi6ionary poepect and .enjoying-the fulfilmenkof their dmam than Mr. D08n;x and that in
middlo 1X9 a:'d with a future before him ; a the romance is not the less for the circumstance Suix he has risen to be the leader of the very party that most abhot IC the political adventurer."
Mr. DisRAE.LI's speech to his Buckinghamshire constituents is hatt devoted to the past and half to the future. He reviews the acts of the DEBmy Administration, and exhibits a perfect cornucopia of beneficial measures-the Militia Act, Law Reform, the acknowledgment of Louts _oAPoLEoN " when the IYArOLEOw dynasty was most un" popular in this country"-as if the DERBY Administration had any option on the subject, and especially when the Republic had been acknowledged as a matter of course. But these evidences of political wisdom must have been designed for those Buckinghamshire electors who are not the best informed on political subjects. Then comes the "fleet of screw men-of-war," the "Ordnance with 200 fieldpieces," the offices of Masters in Chancery, "described as those sinks " of iniquity," abolished, excellent relations with Persia, and no war, though there was a capture of Herat to provoke it then as well as now. Then comes the admirable "Casual Revenues!' BiU-a mysterious name for certain, we dare say, very good regulations with respect to the Australian gold-diggings. The DERBY Government wanted, too, to reform the Ecclesiastical Courts, and wanted to regulate the Income-tax, and wanted to reduce the duty on tea. Foreigners would at first suppose that we were a nation, not of Amazons, but of old women, from the remarkable prominence which all popular, or would-be popular, statesmen give to tea. Twopence or threepence a-pound taken off tea is considered a claim to power. This is Mr. DisRBLu's past, and, though there are one or two good dishes, still his bill of fare is rather " made up." His future partakes somewllat of that romance which characterizes his general career. It is-what do you think-?a Tory Reform Bill ! Mr. DISRAELI tells us "he " is not a bit-by-bit reformer." He does not like dealing with a great question piecemeal. What he wants is a second Reform BiU upon popular Tory principles. The first Reform Bill was partial and onesided. " I think it very probable that if
a large Reform Bill were brought forward by the " Tories much of that evil might be remedied." But wlhen we examine -what this "large ToryReform " Bill" is to be, it turns out to be only a measure for abolishing the "Whig boroughs" which the first Reform Bill left. We have no doubt that this is a piece of reform which 3Vfr. DisrnALi's party would accomplish vith zeal, but it does not come up to our ideas of a " large Bill," based on wide principles. Popular Toryism, however, is a favourite dream of Mr. DrsRiALf's, and he stil punues a bright political vision which combines old principles with new ones, the " historical " Tory" with the modern Democrat. He protests against a " Venetian Aristocracy," just as he did in Conbtgsby, and looks forward to a new era, in which the people will do exactly as they like, but will always manage to agree with the Tory party in the House of Commons. He does not tell us many particulars of this new Reform Bill, but it is not to adopt electoral districts, because " Buckinghamshire "ought not to be blotted out of the political "map." " Remember," he says, with solemn emphasis, " there is no longer to be a county of " Buckingham. Are you prepared to convert
your county into a Department of the Upper "Thames ?" The new Reform Bill, then, will preserve the " glory of Buckingham-
shire, and the traditions which attach to "the turfen road of HA&tPDEN, the temple to "the eloquence of CIrATHAN at Stowe, and the "oak at Beaconsfield, under which BuRnrs medi" tated his reflections on the French Revolution." It will not contain the Ballot. But further particulars are not as yet disclosed, and we must wait till the great secret is out. We do not see at present any great chance of the rise of Mr. DisRAELI's party to power upon such a ground as this, but Mr. DISRAEIJ has, doubtless, prophetic instincts which we do not share. He has his destiny to fulfil ; he appears to have at times marvellous impulses. A sudden thought strikes him, he sees his way, the vista of the future is supernaturally disclosed, and at the end of it is 'Mr. DISRAELI-a Parliamentary Reformer, the Radical Chief of a Tory Cabinet.
It is no wonder if the County Elections should
It is no wonder if the County Elections should seem a little flat, after the first and concentrated excitement of the boroughs. The " shine," as people say, has been taken out of the thiDg; the game, too, is now safe, and it is uphiU work for speakers to go over ground every inch of which has been stamped and trodden by rival orators only three days before. Moreover, the topics of the day are sadly out of joint. The Canton question has been rnled in favour of our authorities,-first by the judgment of the country, and, secondly, by the judgment of the Chinese themselves,so that the most promising arguments on this point have become good for nothing. Lord PALIIEro.N's Government appears to meet with such general approval that the worst the Opposition candidates can say of its leader is, that he is too much like themselves ; and thel scarcely remails, therefore, any telling point to be made on the Conservative side. So, except where the renown of the individual is all-sufficient, as in Buckinghamshire, or whero the speaker has the courage and the hiumour to strike out some new and entertaining vein for himself, like Captain VERNON at Abingdon, the echoes fall rather feebly on the public ear after the roar of a strife which has left half the old champions of Parliament on the field. I
In Hertfordshire the performance we might have anticipated from Sir E. B, LYrrToz was marred by the occirrence of local disagreements, whioh conaumed half his speech, though it is possible he was not sorry. to escape from the difficulties besetting every speaker in his position. " After all," lie observed, "if we look to the " addresses of the various candidates throughout " the kdngdom, it would seem as if it were likely "there would be no Opposition at all in the next
Parliament, and as if we were all to be one "happy family, united in unqualified confidence "and harmony under that patriarchal Minister
"wno announces nothing, and therefore commits "nobody." But it is surely hard to blame a Prime Minister for prudence, especially as Sir EDWARD announced ]lis adhesion to the self-same virlue a minute afterwards, and wisely declined to declare his own intentions as to supporting Government or other-ise. A more striking admission, however, was implied in the complaints made about the dissolution itself. On this subject Sir EDwARD adopted a tone of expostulation, and said that Parliament
had been dissolved on " false pretences ---thrat ithad been " hastily dissolved" and " unfaii. dealt
"w with." Lord PAtEMiSTON, according to his. argument, ought to have proclaimed the intention of Government to send out to Canton a Plenipotentiary like Lord ELaiN, and then there would have been no majority against him, and consequently no dissolution. The House, too, vvhich was thus despatched to the countty) had supported the Ministry steadfastly throughout the Russian war, and deserted more considerate treatment. Now, we do not at all doubt the inpleasantone of the poition in which Si EDwAr anu kis friends have found the but we d u~Ioetherito thejuatice Me ihi renfou*aw,.,, me uges that if J,ord&
umiip.on. uv~rsut of th8 vot ag3a
Government, it conveys, therefore, the vindication of that vote; but what would have been said if ul, step at all had been taken in deferenee to A' was held up to Government as the solemn ja[me2 t of the House of Commons ? And how does fS ,,Sw mission affect or prejudge the simple point at is,,-e-the policy of our authorities in China,-wri3;& was attacked by the Opposition and defended by th.e Government ? It leaves that policy exactly whkee 1i found it, without compromising Sir J. Bowiaso at all. As affairs had assumed an aspect of mix Wore than usual menace in those quarters, our wioe Atrength out there, civil as well as military, it to be reinforced. For the appeal to arms, shou2d it unfortunately be continued, we send steamer% and gunboats, mountain batteries and fresh battalions. For the appeal to reason-as reason may have to be represented toYnnf's superiors as well as YER himself -we despatch a new Plenipotentiary, whose sphere of act'ion is expansive, and who may proceed with his remonstrances, if necessary, to the capital of the Celestial Empire. As to the argument from deserts, such questions are ticklish oues; but, if the House stood by Lord PAL11ERSTON in the war, we tlhink Lord PALmERSToN did certainly stand by the House. Indeed, Mr. ENIGEmEY fairly owned, inINorthamptonshire, that his Lordship's "conduct "w hen he took office was deserving of the highest " credit."
Taking a comprehensive survey of the county addresses, of the sentiments which they contain, and of the ideas which they evidently imply, we think it more manifest than ever that Conservatism, if it really means anything like opposition to progress, is fast losing ground among these constituencies as well as in the boroughs. It is rare to find a speaker whose declaration of opinion is not susceptible of a construction which might satisfy any reasonable Liberal. Captain VFmiNoN, though coming forwvrd expressly to preserve the Conservatism of Berkshire from alloy, wants to see Free Trade carried further still for the benefit of the agriculturists, and announces his determined approval of Administrative Reform. Sir EDWARD LYTToN, too, claimed credit for his efforts in the same Liberal direction; nor have we forgotten his candid advocacy on that and other occasions. But Administrative Reform is a doctrine of most decided LiberaJism-so decided, indeed, that some Liberals are rather perplexed with it, not as impugning its objects, but as doubting the efficacy of the machinery for carrying it into effect. As to any of the old cries, we find scarcely a trace of them; -never, indeed, where the speaker is urder the necessity of recommending himself and his opinions to a body of electors in a position competent to pronounce upon them.
It is amusing to find that one of the chief fallacies in use'during the last month has been hit off ancd exposed by a young candidate for his first seat. In South Northamptonshire Lord ALTBoRP, in addressing the electors, observed that "there was "no great question now before the constituencies; "the only point was whether Lord PArEiamsToN " or Lord DZBBY was to govern the country. " The leader of the Opposition. said that Lord " PA1EuxRSToN had nothing to go to the country "upon but his name; but surely it was something "to have a name on which to go to the country. "The other side had no such name." There is the whole argument turned inside out. If there was any longer a party avowing those principles which once constituted Toryism, and afterwards went, in a diluted shape, to tne manufacture of Conservatism or Protectionism, the Liberals could have gone to the country, as in times past, wlith a profession of political faith; but when Conservatism is toned down to a tint scarcely distinguishable from that of Liberalism such a course becomes unnecessary, and, as measures have been assimilated, the stand is taken upon men. Here, however, comes the distinction. Mr. STAFFORD, in his candid and good-humoured speech at Kettering, said that if he were wishing for an expression of his opinions he could not have found one better than that delivered by Lord, PAL-5MESTON on his own behalf at Tiverton. Very good. Now, when a man of as much note among the Liberals as Mr. STAFFORD is among the Conservatives will say as much for Lord DERBY as Mr. STAFFORD has said for Lord PA4IrnsTON, the claims of the two parties will be matched; but, until then, that which has all that the other has, and the balance of a name to boot, is most likely to carry the day.
The innocent country lad who pays his first visit
The innocent country lad who pays his first visit to London is traditionally supposed to be impressed with awe at the sigbt of the vast buildings of the city, and to be lost in wonder at the mysterious wealth which must be hoarded up behind the barred doors and solid walls that surround him. Most of us have a similar tendency to worship the unknown, but from material objects we transfer our admiration to men or institutions. WVe do not believe, with the ploughboy, in actual moneybags and diamonds heaped together from floor to ceiling, but we have not lost our trust in " concerns" which must give untold wealth to all connected with them, and bold, sagacious, but, of course, honourable speculators, who transmute all they touch into gold. There is a style of man eminently the product of this age, who can do anything with the British public. Let any body of tradesmen or clergymen, or even fairly acute men of business, fall in with a gentleman said to be rich and respectable, neat in his person, with a reputation for philanthropy and attention to religious duties, and there is no bound to their confidence. They will not only trust him with all he ask-s for, but they will seek him, force their money upon him, and think themselves happy that their fortumes are in the care of one at once so sagacious and honourable. We do not believe that any number of exposures will eradicate this tendency, which is a part of English middle-class nature; but still the case of the Royal British Bank, particularly as it was detailed in the examinat;on of Mr. APsLEY PELLATT yesterday, may servo as a useful lesson for confiding investors who Lave some idol of their own in the shape of a. pious City man wbo is to make their fortunes. Mr. PThmATr's examination gives an exeellent notion of " how i' s " done" in these days, what a Bauk nuy be, what Directors may be, and whai the :' 11Lic is - all times sure to be.
- The celebrated "Xo N, mi rio :a .' ac; .. jreprescents the character of Mr. ," -LAT's explanations. He is in a most singular n _ aer oblivious of every unfortuniate feature in the career of the Royal l!riti3h' Bank. He was one of the founders of that ' beneficent" institution, and yet,from the daywhen it .was opened with prayer and a fourth of the proper capital to the day when he retired from tb.a drection, he -was not aware of a single circtuietance of which it would be convenient to be igiorauit. But we cannot attempittpgitq,aCi0tion of the: late Director`s explanations except by a aimmary of the proceedings. On the 12th of February, 1849, Mr. PsnAXr became connected with the newly-formed Bank. It was to be formed under the Act of the 7th and 8th VICroBJA, and yet Mr. P.TAT:r, in his:- innocence, thought thaf it would be establisheai ihe principle of limited liability. The legal kowloedge and the sincerity of tbe founders niy-be appreciited when we are i4?d IbM tliey actual] pnblined a prospectus to
lg'ff ect, MIr. k Rot only did nit know at
the 0ommencelIGAt that under the Act in question each shareholder would be liable to his last she iu and that consequently the prospectus of himset. and friends was fraudulent, but he " could not " say when it first came to his knowledge that "the Bank was not founded on limited " liability." We shall see in the sequel how treacherous the witness's memory ha3 been as to the time when he first learnt the important fact. But we are now at the beginning of 1849. Let us consider the style of carrying on busines3. Mr. MuILS, " in consideration of his being ap"pointed Solicitor to the Bank, had *mdertaken "to pay all preliminary expenses," and a minute was made to that effect. Mr. PEuA-,.T ioes not know that he signed this minute-he siaed it without reading it. This piece of work having been transacted, the projectors came to the important question of capital. It Rives to us poor mortals a most magnificent idcea of tfie grandeur of these gentlemen's conceptions when we find that Mr. PErrLAT has really forgotten whether the capital waa to be 100,0001. or 500,0001. It mattered little to such splendid financial geniu5res as the founders of the Royal British Bank. MIr. MONTAGuLZ TIGG, when he founded the AngloBengalee Disinterested Life Assurance Company, told his confidential colleague that the paid-up capital, according to the next prospectus, would be a figure of 2, with as many ciphers after it as the printer could get into the same line. Similar vague grandeur of ideas meems to have possessed the Directors of the Royal British Bank. " It was proposed to commence the Bank with "a capital of 100,0001. On referring to the "document produced he found the amount "was 500,0001. That documeneD was, no doubt, "correct, and his recolleetion wrong." So much for the question of capital. Then came the question of hability. This the Directors disposed of summarily. "A An advertisemert was issued, "stating that shareholders would incur no lia"bility beyond the amount of their paid-up stock, "and depositors no risk whatever." "The "advertisement was inserted in pursuance of a "minute bearing his signature." The law of the land with respect to Joint-stock Banks seems never to have been considered worthy of notice by the founders of the Royal British.
The attention and supervision given to the affairs of the shareholders by Mir. PEzLTiTT and his brcthren may be understood by a reference to the episode of BIr. M&sfzrs, who, it appears, was secretary without anybody's knowing it. This gentleman's name appears in more than one advertisement with that of Mr. PELLATT; he was sent to Newcastle to establish a branch, and a letter is addressed to him by the Solicitor authorizing him to appoint a manager in the north; yet Mr. PELLATr "must state "that he did not know that Mr. MxxzrEs "had ever been Secretary to the Bank. He could "never make out correctly what he was." So niuch for the accuracy of directorial knowledge. However, Mr. MExmZs' connexion with the coneern soon terminated in a most cruel manner. This able financier, whose projected branch in the North was to bring in " a "c lear profit of 50,0001. a-year" from Sunderland alone, fell, it would seem, a victinm to some remorseless creditor, who would not wait for the realization of his schemes. We find him writing from Newcastle for 101., in default of which small sum he is "fast ;" and though on the 12th of May he is authorized by a minute " to "comply with the request of the Newcastle share"holders," yet we are told that " in June XZ=mm "was in Whitecross-street Prison." We have here a glimpse of the personiel of the institution which was to create a revolution in the banking system of the country.
We have seen that the difference between 100,0001. and five times that amountwas too trifling to make any impression on Mr. PEXI-ATes memory; and we cannot wonder at this when we find his name affixed to an advertisement " settincg forth "that the coramencing capital was 100,0001., "with power of gradual increase to 2,000,0001." Mr. PELLATr now attempts to repudiate this advertisement, which contains his own name as Director, and that of MIr. MmIwZirs as Secretary. "It was very wrong; if he had seen the advertise"ment he should have objected to it." But the remorseless Mr. LIN-LATEzu produces prospectus after prospectus with the same names, and it must be left to tne world to judge how far a man's name could be put to a series of printed and Dublished
cLccuments of such importance without his being aware of it. We then come to the petition for a Charter. The petition states that the deed has bceen executed by the holders of more than onehalf the shares, of which not less than 101. on each share has been paid up. MIr. PELarT "took no pains to ascertain whether the "statements contained in this application for "a Charter were true." On the 3d of A-ugust, 1849, the Secretary reported that the Royal approval h4d been obtained, and that a Charter would shortly be granted; and on the very same day we find by a Minute bearing the signature of Mr. PLL!ATrr that an advertisement was ordered to be inserted inx Tle Timws that the Charter had received the Royal approval. Yet on the 27th of July a statement had been made showing that the deposits had not been duly paid up. "If he had wrongly "adopted that Minute it was from care"lessness," confesses Mr. PELLATT. We cannot wonder that the confession was greeted with " exclamations." In fact, it is plain that the Oharter was obtained by false pretences. Mr. IRLATZIC produced the certificate of the Governor and Directors, signed by MIr. PrLATrr, to the effect that " one-half of the amnount of each "sbare had been paid up in respect of " each of such shares." At that thne CAMERON'S promissory note had been taken for shares, and the Bank; held promissory notes instead of capital to the extent of 7,0001. and upwards. Indeed, there was only an actual cash balance of 26,0001., and with this sum the Bank began business. This was the capital which was to be cgradually increased to 2,000,0001. 1"
But the most singular point is Mr. PELLArT's forgetfulness about the liability of the shareholders.
: one time he tells us that when the Charter was given he knew that the liability was unlimited; that some time after he joined the Bank he gained this knowledge ; but afterwards he lets fall that he believed, until the Bank failed, that the liability was limited. On being asked to explain this contradiction, he says that "he had a notion " that the liability was limited to double the " amount of sharex, in consequence of a Bill "which Mr. CARDVwn, or, more likely, MIr. "Lowe, introduced." He is very uncertain about the rnatter, though he had advertised an assurance to the shareholders eight years ago that they were liable only to one-fourth of the amount of their shares. But why should we pursue the subject 7 Our readers will have had sufficient to enable them to judge of the character of this institution and of its founders. It remains only that we call attention to the letter of Mr. CA&oxnO, a composition certainly unique in style and morality. The whole proceedings may afford, a, useful lesson to the confiEng holders of such shares as those distrtQed by 3Ir.

there are many clever men in France-men
"le of studying any question with the most capa a,- t rosPts; but, clever and capable aS they are, iy must absolutely have somethtng to go upa small need or cutting which they may coax' UP *W s ztately tree. There are, indeed, few points' eiter hn philosophy or history upon which Frenc, wters ave not ,vritten, and written well; butt even they must have a few facts ready to their hb.1d5. O NOW, it seems that in France at the prerent "noment the strongest curiosity exists upon the subjeei+ of elections, but from calais to MIarseilles, from lYantes to Strasburg, there are no facts upon the subject forthcoming. If the reading public of Fraixce are desirous of information upon popalar forms and the excesses of the hustings, the_r laudable curiosity cannot be gratified with &mestic incidents of any kind. It is clearly no b5usiness of ours to challenge the acts of a Government which has been so true and loyal to "1 throughout a period of common peril and o a eommon stuggle as that of the French EMF"More has undoubtedly been; still, when French writers come among us for the sake of criticizing our institutions, we may sr-rely be permitted in our turn to glance at their own. We freely admit that any intelligent foreigner who may have been brought up under the decent forms of despotism must be a little astonished at the scenes which occur on an English nomination-day and' at an English polling-booth. The liberty of the Briton' upon such occasions has a wild sweet-briery smack which to a Frenchman must savour strangely of excess and anarchy. - Strange to say, however, the system lasts-banners, brickbats, and blutality to the contrary notwithstanding. Mad as the genial nproar may appear in the eyes of a foreigner, precisely similar scenes occurred before thb States-General met at Versailles; but still E:ngland goes on without revolution, without fusillades, without a master, but with a greater amount of personal and political liberty than is to be found in any other country of Europe. We do not, then, wonder so much that a French writerM. ALEXANDRE Du.us, the younger-should have come among us in electioneering times to study on the spot a subject on which he will certainly find little informa'ion in his native land.
Thus rmuch premised, we turn to M. DurAs' account of our metropolitan elections, as published in the columns of the Parisian Presse. In one sense, perhaps, we may be indifferent critics, for familiarity has blunted our senses to much which in the eyes of a stranger may appear preeminently ridiculous. If the scenes which M. DurwAs describes seem as absurd to his readers as his account of them does to us, they must derive considerable gratification from his narrative. Here is his account of the three candidates on the hustings at Southwark :-" MIr. PEATT is a man "from 45 to 50, meagre, small, nervous head, "beard and eyes, everything dark. The Admiral SNAPIM is an old man, of from 65 to 70, fat, "short, of robust build, with gray hair and black "eyes, and hairs all over the face; Scotch head "and Scotch dialect. Mr. Locx is a man of 48, "the face covered with pock-holes, vigorous, "broad chest, made for the struggles of the bar, "and ready for the much more exhausting strug"gles of the tribune." All this is true enough, but it is written and printed in that jerking, emphatic style, peculiar to French romance-writers who are paid by the line, and who never for a moment lose sight of the system of payment. WI. DAss goes on to describe the reception which was given to each of the canudidates ;* how King Mob roared out to Mr. APbLEy PELLATT, " you'll " be smashed nextWednesday, old fellow !" and how he was groaned at for about the space of a quarter of an hour. The worthy Admiral followed, and his speech was listened to " with expressions of "hilarity which proved that merry England was "still ' la jo7yeuse Anglete*rre2" The highest touches of eloquence are, however, reserved for AMr. Locm's detiU. " Instead of a thunder
"coming from below, it was now a thunder coming I "from above. Like ADito3c}cnx when she ! "encouraged HEcron down from the walls "of Troy, Mrs. Locic encouraged her hus"band down from a balcony." In this style the letter runs on, and really, except that it is written in short paragraphs, after the true Parisian model, we cannot see much in it which mnight not easily have been gathered from the columns of any metropolitan journal. Still we cannot but rejoice that any intelligent Frenchman-and such M. ALEXWNDBE DuA undoubtedly isshould come among us and study the political a'id social life of England. Let him only mark results as well as processes. If there be anything in the hurly-burly of a Southwark election to shock his sensibilities, let him consider what the consequences would have been of a similar gathering at Paris-let us say in the Paubourg St. Antoine.

Serious Accidents In The Bristol River.-On
SERiovs AcciDEnTs 1N Tr E BRISTOL Rrv,n-On Tuesday the Mary Ann Peters, a vessel of 550 tons re. gister, formerly engaged in the American emigration trade, but recently purchased by Messrs. Breiford and Dyer, African merchants, as a store vessel on the coast of Africa, grounded in the Bristol river, just outside the lock gates. The Mary Ann Peters left the basin, it is stated, about three minutes beforo the time of high water. She passed through the small lock, and then turned sharply round towards the Rounham side of the ferry. There is a bank of gravel, or
hard," as it is termed, lying there, and over this the vessel dragged, till at last she hung fast on the centre of the bank formed by the ferry lip on t Raunbam aide. The tide by thbi time had begun to ebb, and notwithstanding the topmasts, &e., were almost immediately cut away, with the view of lightening her, the unfortunate ship continued to settle down more and more into the berth iu which she lay. ighterswerethenprocured, anda considerable portion of her cargotaken out inthe hopeoffloating her at the evening tide; but, although the most strenuous efforts were made for the purpose, tbey were useles, the vessel not shifting her position. Yesttrday morning another trial was made, but there being two feet les water thau an the previous day, this also was dnsuceessful, and it is feared that several days 'ill elapse before iho will be 'doated. The vessel is 'ery much stried, to that if the s*bsequent efforts to float her should prove suoce6sful she will not, in the opinion of nautioal men, be worth the expense of reairing.

City Of London General Pension Society.-
CITY OF LO-XDoN GENEBAL PENSION SoCniTy.- Tho 38th anniversary of this society was celebrated on Tues. day evening at the London Tavern, Bishopsgate.street, when a banquet, presided over by Mr. Sheriff Mechi, was provided in a style of unusual excellence by the well-knownx proprietors of that establishment. Mr. Mechi was sur
rted by hs Grace the Duke of Wellington, Co1onel de, ath, ir James Duke, M.P., Under-Sheriff Crosleyr, Messrs. T. Capron, J. Dillon, W. H. Roberts, G. W. Roper, and a long Mt of the friends and supporters of theinstitution. After the usual loyal toasts bad been g!ven and duly responded to, the chairman proposed "Prosperity to the City of London General Pension Society, and mav ity flourish for ever!" He stated that the institution ivas. established in 181S by a few charitable individuals, under the auspices and patronage of his late Royal Eighness the Dukeof Kent, with aviewto lessenthe privations and topreserve from penury and want the decayed mechanic anc
worn-out artisan, when old age and misfortune had overtaken him. The plan was to grant monthly pensions tn decayed artisans, mechanics, manufacturers, andtradesmen, and to their bereaved and destitute widows. Since its estabrishment the society had been the means of granting, permanent relief in old age to no less than 906 poor pensioners, and the amount thus distributed up to the present time had been 60,1841. 2s. But, owing to various c'ausessuch as the formation of separate societies, the general pressuie upon all classes durnng the past two years arsing from the increased cost of supplies, and taxation of almost every description-there had been a considerabledecrease iui the anrual contributions to the society, and this had obliged& the directors to reduce the amount of allowance to the mem to 22s. per month, and to the women to 15s. per month, being a reduction of 5s. per month to the men and 3s. per month to the women. He hoped, however, that fresh energy woald be infused into the society, so that the maximumt allowance might soon again be paid to those deserving obiectsof theirbounty. Thechatrmantook occasionto saythat he had received a letter from his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, who expressed a deep interest in the prosperity of the society, and, as a testimony of his goodwill had enclosed a check for lOt. lOs. signed by his own hand.
The worthy sheriff here handed the check to the ladies what were seated immediately opposite the chair, that they might havo the gratification of seeing the autograph of the Royal Duke. On the health of the Duke of Wellington beingproposed, his Grace inreturning thanks, after expressingthegreat gratification he bad experiencedinattendingtheannivers
of so commendable a society, said that one motive which bad attracted him to the meeting was to have the pleasure of being introduced to Mr. Mechi, of whose farming experiments he had heard so much. (Laughter.) The noble utke then proposed the health of the chairman, -who, ir
acInowledging the compliment, observed that he trnstedthat the illustrious name of Wellington being associated with the proceedings of that society would have a most beneficial tffect in calling attention to the, strorg claims which it had en the benevolence of the public..
With regard to his farmingexperiments, he would simplyremark that prejudice, as a coneervitive principle, was not to be condemned. ARl the gteat modern inventions by which science had been made subeervient to tbe poroe and interests of man were at their frst introduciion pooh= pcohed. So vith regard to his farming system. Be *ould. not expect that his pnoci le would be adoptedforacetury to come (laughter), but they would moat a*uredly at last prevaiL (Cheers.) Mr. G. Mence, the secretary, thew. read a list of contributions, which in the aggregate amounted to npwards of 5O01. The proeeedingsof th evening were agreeably diversified by everal well-sung songs and glees by the Mi,ea Brougham and messrs. GengZ. Holmnes, Shoubridge, and Smithson, while Mr. Harker seataled his repute as one of the first of toestters.

(FROM OUIL OWN CORRESPONDK.)
[A portion of the foUowing appeared in our second edi. tVon of yesterday:-1
PARIS, MARCH 31, 6 P.M.
A superior officer of Engineers of the Piedmontese army has arrived in Paris. He is said to be charged by his Government with requesting the favour of beiDg permitted to copy the old plans of the fortifications of Alessandria, which were executed during the first Empiro. It is the old French system which is to be followed at present. I alluded yesterday to the rumour of the probability of an arrangement between theVienna and Turin Cabinets through the good offices of France and England. Whether any temporary reconciliation will be patched up or not I cannot say, but it is certain that so long as Austria and Piedmont stand in the position they do relatively to each other no sincere or durable friendship is possible between them.
The crime of Sardinia is not that her press has now and then a strong article on Austrian politics, which is not allowed to penetrate into the Italian provinces of Austria * the sin she has committed, still commits, and will, I trust, continue lon- to commit, and for which she can never hope for pardon from Vienna, is her free government, and the prosperity, beyond aU comparison with the rest of the ItalianPeninsula, which coexists with those libelrties. The Italian people cannot but contrast their own situation witlh that of the subjects of Victor Emmanuel; and, however good the concessions recently granted to the Lombards, these will be ever turning a wistful eye to the country which enjoys complete freedom. Under such circumstances no reaUy good fee]ing can ever exist between them, and the restoration of diplomatic relations, which has been sken of, will not diminish the dislike with which these Governments regard each other.
The heirs of Prince Eugene Beauharnois are about to institute legal proceedings against the publishers of MLarshal Marmont's (Duke de Ragusa's) memoirs. Indeed, hardly a day passes that does not bring remonstrances from the kinsfolk of the leading personages who figure in them. These complaints are often strong, and in some cases go the length of accusing the writer of wilful falsehood in his statements. It was attempted to be shown in the last volume that Prince Eugene had not been free from the taint of ingratitude and perfidy towards his benefactor in the days of his adversity of which so many others were guilty. Marmont's name was among the most noted, and in his memoirs he appears anxious to reduce aU to the same condition, and thus to diminish his own particular disg,race.
Since I last wrote more arrests have been made in one or two quarters of Paris; the charge is the same-a plot against the person of the Emperor. So, at least, it is said. I hear also that sufficient evidence has been procured to satisfy the authorities that some of the refugees in England are the accomplices, if not the instigators, of this new conspiracy, and that this evidence wiU afford ground for a demand to the English Government respecting the refuvees.
M. Eniile Augier, the dramatic author, was this day elected a member of the French Academy by a majority of one vote. His competitor was h. Victor de Laprade, also a poet, though not generally known. The contest was a warm one between the two, and a ballot took place twice.
An English gentleman, who during a short stay at Blois was made the object of much ill-treatment on the part of the authorities of that place, owing to a most unfounded suspicion on the part of a baniker, has laid his case before the English Ambassador. Lord Cowley has taken the matter up, and there is little doubt that reparation wvill be re(iuired for the indignity to which he has been subjected by the Commissary of Police and the Juge d'Instruction of Blois. The matter is now before the Minister of Justice, and it is not at all improbable that legal proceedings will be taken against the p)artics by the gentleman in question.
The Plenipotentiaries met for the fifth time today on that wearisome business, the Neuchttel question. Dr. Kern received yesterday despatches containing new instructions in reply to the Prussian propositions, and they have been laid before the Confereiice. What the precise nature of these instructions is we do not know, but I doubt whether the question will be brought to a close so soon as was expected.
Intelligence from Constantinople tothe 23d has been received at Marseilles by the Hydaspe. The Grand Vizier had given notice to the different Legations that he would expel all Mussulman subjects, with conti.cation of their property, who should refuse the usual militarystibsidies under pretext of being under foreign protection. The Russians were concentrating considerable forces at Anapa and Ekaterinodar. The news of the successes of the Circassians is confirmed. Mehemed Bey is adopting energetic measures to resist an attack of the Russians. From Persia the accoints speak of the continuance of the civil disorders. The operations in Affghanistan were suspended in consequence of the severity of the weather.

(FROM OUR Olvy CORRESPONDgNT.)
VIENNA, MAiRCH 29.
The official part of the Wiener Zeitung of this morning contains the following-
" His Imperial Royal Apostolic 'Majesty has thought fit (sich bestimraf p,efulen) to recaU his Embassy from the Court of Sardinia.
" As a consequence of an understanding with the Pris. :ian Court on the subject, tho Prussian Embassy at Turin will, should it be necessary, uphold the interests of the subjects of His Austrian Afajesty in the kingdom of Sardinia."
Subjoined is a translation of the despatch which, on the 16th of March, was forwarded to Count Paar at Turinn:-
" Sir,-Directly after the return of the Emperor to his capital I took orders of His Majesty on the subject of Count Cavour's despatch of the 20th of February, which was to serve as a reply to the reclamations you were charged to make to that Minister. I am at present able to communicate to you the impression which that document produced on the mind of the Emperor, and to give you directions for the regulation of your conduct.
" The explanations offered by Count Cavour are far from having entirely satisfied us. That IBinister publioly and plainly confesses that the Piedmontese press has been guilty of excesses which are greatly to be regretted. He openly condemns them. We willingly take note (prenowns acte) of an avowal so candidly made, and duly appreciate the ieeling whichr led to the declaration. Although we acknowledge the uniformity of our views on this point, we are unable to subscribe to the inferences which M. de Cavour draws from his declaration. In fact, the President of the Counoil seems to think he is dispensed from all effort to repress those abuses of the press, the existence of which he acknowledges, as soon as he has pointed out to foreign Governments that judicial measures are a sovereign remedy against them. He seems to be inclined to release himself from ahllresponsibility, and to leave it entirely to the foreign Governments to take the initiative in the repression of those excesses.
" Thi is not our view of things. The system proposed might suffice for the ordinary, I may say forthe accidental, abuses from which the most respectable press Is never quite free; bat we do not think this passiveness of the local Gco vernment is justifiable when the excesses (6carts) of the press assume (as in the present case) the form of a regular system of calling in question the validitt of trties, and -when the violence and turpitde of the excesses are cred tg pwuc pitch that revolt in.

inclined to respect treaties itself, but to make them respocted by its subjects.
"If we have properly understood the sense of Count Cavot&s reply, that Minister seems to think we only complained of the polemics of the public papers, but our complaints bore reference alo to the eneouragement, as well open as tacit, which the press received from the attitude of the Government.
" Couut Cavour gives us the assurance that he will not permit anything on the monument which is to be ereoted at Turin to the Sardinian army that oiuld give umbrage to our snsceptibilityor tothat of onrarmy. Woregret that we were obliged to incite him to an aseuxance which, under aU circumstaneos, would have been of much greater import. ance if it had been given spontaneously. Al the same time that we express our appreciation of the intention which led to such a declaration, we take the liberty of remarking, that M. de Cavour, when speaking of the simple proofs of sympathy which he has received from our Italian province; and from other parts of the Peninsula, takes no notice whatever of the series of pretended deputations (preendums d4upuions) which he bl received in person. This appears to us to be a most important faot, for, if it is not of a nature to constitute a regular eneouragement to revolt, it at least tends to relax those ties which unite legitimata Sovereigns and their subjects.
" It is true that AT. de Cavour affirms, in the name of th3 Sardinian Government, that it is his firm intention com. pletely to fulfil towards his neighbours the obligations and duties which the law of nations and treaties impose on him, but he will permit us to ask if the tolerance which he displays towards a press which incessantly attacks those terri
torial limitations that are consecrated by treaty is in keeping with his assurances-if the personal reception which he has given to numerous addresses, aU inspired by the hollow vision of Italian unity, and all tending to detach subject from their duties towards their Governments-is in accord with the letter and spirit of that treaty of peace, in which the King of Sardinia renounced all claim and pretension to the eountry situate beyond the hnmits of Sardinia, as those limits were fixed by the final act of the Congress of Vienna? Does Count Cavour think that he well interpreted the international duties of Piedmont towards Austria, and towards his other neighbounrs, when he received deputations and accepted addresses presented by foreign subjects, persons who are not bound by any particnlar tie to Sardinia ? Does not his conscience reproach him with having, by these acts, encouraged evil passions, and furnished allment for the ceaseless attaoks of a malevolent press?
" On this point we have a right to expect explanations from Mi. de Cavour, as they alone can give us a just idea of the value which is to be attached to his protestations of respect for existing treaties.
" If we were disinclined to indulge in recriminations in respect to the past, and were willing to consider the assurance given by AiL de Cavotr an indication of a more propitious future, that Minister has deprived us of the possibility of doing so, for simultaneously with the delivery of his depatch the Correspondance Itienne, lithograpbed at Turin, on the same day stated that the Presiaent of the Conncil had received a deputation of citizens from Modena and Reggio, who spoke of the ties which bound them to Piedmont, ties which were forcibly severed for the moment, but which faith kept in full vigour. We appeal to the good faith of M. de Cavour, and ask him whether the reception given to this address-and .it mnst not be forgotten that thisis not an isolated fact-is in keep. ing with the respect which is due to treaties? We ask him whether his conduct was in keeping with the assurauces which he at the same time gave us? Or does he think it would be proper (loisible) for us to seek redress for this attack on treaties by bringing an action against the editor of a paper whose offence was that he had made mention of an action performed by the Minister of the King, or at least of one which he has never disavowed?
" Count Cavour indulges at length in recriminations relative to wrongs committed by the Austrian press, which, if they were weU founded, would make no change in the nature of the controversy. But the reclamation which we have addressed to him furnishes him with no motive for reniedying the evil we have pointed out. He has not uttered one word which can induce us to hope that such an abnormal state of things wiU cease. On the contrary, we are induced to beheve he does not think of changin- a ihne of conduct the results of which appear to him to te so satisfactory.
" Until this state of things has undergone a change it is not compatible with the dignity of the Emperor to leave his diplomatic agent at Turin, where he is daily exposed to be an eye-witness of demonstrations which must more or less directly tend to shake the force of treaties and to lead to new complications. It is for this reason, Count, that I invite you to quit Turin, and to come here to communicate to us orally the final explanations which the President of the Council may think proper to give. When announeing your departure to Count Cavour, you can express our regrets to see ourselves under a necessity which we must deplore, and from which we had always hoped to be able to escape. You will tell him that we heartiy wish to see the moment arrive when a ifore suitable state of things wiU permit a representative of Austria to return to Turin You wil also add that we, on our side, see no obstacle to the Marquis de Cantnno (who will not be exposed to the same inconvenience) continuing to reside at Vienna. Itgives uspleasuretoacknowledgethehonourable conduct of 1L de Cantono,andhe maybe convincedtbathewillmeetwiththerespect due to his nublic character. As it is our desire that this step shoula not be in any way prejudicial to the reciprocal interests of the two countries, we shall at once take such measures on tbe frontier that your absence may not be detrimental to the peaceable subjects of the two States, and that private relations may not suffer by the momentary cessation of our diplomatic action at Turin. We are confident that after your departure the subjects of the Emperor residing in Piedmont will continue to enjoy the fuU protection of the laws of the country. Should, however, any diplomatic in. tervention be required between them and the Royal authoritie, the Court of Berlin has, at our request, authorized its representative at Turin to take charge of it.

A letter from Naples of the 23d of March states that the Government had issued orders to hold in readiniess the frigates Parthenope and Regina, of 64 guns each. The Brigadier Bracco, DirectorGeneral of the Naval Departmient, had freighted several of the largest and best merchant ships in the port. It was said at Naples that the raerchant ships were to sail after Easter laden with political prisoners, for the Argentine 31epublic, and to be escorted by the two frigates. It is added that for some time past the Neapolitan Govermnent has made overtures for an arrangement of existing difficulties with the Western Powers through the Prussian Governrment. The King would engage to send away all the political prisoners without exception on condition that the Western Powers would previously declare themselves satisfied, and engage to prevent the return to Italy of all politica prisoners who shaU consent to expatriate themselves to .the banks of the Parana. Those reports, circulated through the public, and repeated by the police agents, who incessantly declare that friendly relations are about to be re-established between the Government of the Two Sicilies and those of Great Britain and France, have produced a painful ueneation. It would appear from the preparations made by the Government that a great number of politi prisoners are about to be transported to South America; nevertheless, it is a positive fact that the number of prisoners who have agreed to submit to transportation is very small. The question is asked, does the Government mean to use force and compel the State prisoners to proceed to Amerlca against their will, or does it propose to send State prioners and felons mixed together ? Many persons believe that the Government will compel all those, whether military or civil, to expatriate themselves who have been armsted for the simple reaon that they were friends, relatives, or acquaintances of Milano, the soldier who in Decemiber hlt sttempted to aisa nate the Kin

THE STATE OF NAPLES.
(PROE OURa OWiN CORRESPOfDiN=T.)
NAPLES, MARcu 25.
Every season has its special character, and speaking of Naples I should say the present season is one of projects. They follow one another so rapidly that one literallyloses one's breath in sympathy with their speed, and a person not well acquainted with the country wouldbe disposed to augur well of its future. Concessions of railways to Brindisi, to TAranto, and through the Abruzzi-concessious of mines in Calabria-bonded warehouses-modifications of the tariff-provincial councils and provincial commissions-improved prison discipline for those whom a paternal Government takes under its care, and comfortable settlements on the Plata for many who have long rejoiced in its benevolence-these, together with many others, are the measures adopted for the amelioration and development of this happy land. It is always an ungrateful task to dispute or oppose what has even the appearance of good, or to chaUenge the intentions of those who originate it; but the present time demands that the truth should be spoken. Naples is not like England, or any other country, where hones'y of purpose or energy of action may be calculated upon; on the contrary, as far as regards honesty, it is much to be feared that the apparent activity to which I have alluded has a special object in view, which is to delude foreign Govermments into the idea that the Government of the Two Sicilies is really bent on the development of the material resources of the country, and thus to call off their attention from what the country seriously wants,and what alone can secure its progress in the arts of civilization. "1 They are trying to blind and deceive your Government," said a very clever man to me lately, "and they will do it too-there is nothing in which they so excel as in the art of deception." If conciliation is to be effected byan act of transportation, such as the Argentine Treaty, or even by an amnesty, its deception wil have been most successful, for if every prison were emptled of its contents, and nothing more were done, tfie country would be precisely in the same condition as when the legations were withdrawn,-its evils untouched. I repeat it again and again, the laws are admirable, but they are inoperative, and the only measures that will restore peace and prosperity to the country will be guarantees for the due execution of them. As for promises, only those who are willing to be deceived, or who are ignorant of the Government of this country, will place even a moment's faith in them. The ears of the Neapolitaus are ringing with abortive promises and projects.
A strong persuasion still prevails among many that the difficulties between the Governments are on the point of being settled. I must confess that I see no evidence of it; and such is the animuss of the King, that only such terms would be offered as England could not accept with honoiur or consistency. She may, it is true, patch up a bad business, and, as she has done before, abandon the Italians; but it will be at the expense of character and of the future tranquility of this country.
I have strong and recent reasons for believing that the fate of the Mlontesarchio prisoners is now worse than it was, and that they are treated with greater severity. Some of the German papers assert that alL that has been said on the subject is false, and that they never have worn chains. It is again affirmed now, without fear of contradiction, that they wear their chains up to the present time. Still the treatment of these unfortunate men is only an incident in the history of the land, and I am very far from pointing it out as the grievance the removal of which would change the aspect of the country.
The police are more unbridled and arbitrary in their action than they have been at almost any pre. vious period of their history, but it would be tedious to enumerate instances of it.
As regards the administration of affairs, you may imagine how they are conducted from a circular of the Minister of Finance to the employ's, in which he complains of their inaction, of the pilferings practised, and in which he stigmatizes them as " ladri." Indeed, every branch of the administration has fallen into disorder from that system of favouritism which is necessary for the support of an unjust and unpopular Government.
BWy a Royal rescript, signed on the 5th of March this year, a new concession has been granted to the Baron de Riseis for the construction of a railway through the Abruzzi, the road to Coprano being excluded. The former concession expired in December last, in consequence of the non-pay ment of the second instalment of the caution money. Together with the new concession is granted an extension of time of six months. The road to Coprano, which forms a portion of the line to Rome, is, I understand, m course of construction by the Government. The Frascati line will meet it.
A Tunisian vessel of war came into port last Monday with an envoy on board on a mission to this Government. He dined with His Majesty at Caserta yesterday.
The French frigate Audaciense is on the point of leaving for Sicily, in fact has now gone out of port. The MIalacca will probably start on another cruise next Saturday.
A telegraphic despatch was received here last Sunday ordering the immediate sale of the effects of the late Sir William Temple. By many this has been interpreted as an indication that matters were not so near a settlement as some imaagined. Baron Brenier's goods are also being sold.

The Riots At Kidderminsters.
THE RIOTS AT KIDDEBEMINSTER.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-If no one better qualified than myself should have addressed you on the same subject, will you aUow me to refer to a portion of your article of to-day, which may, I think, create an impression that the authorities of Kidder. minster did not act with sufficient forethought in selecting Blakebrook for the position of the husings?
The town lies in a deep hoUow, and aU the old roads leading into it run down steep descents. The present road from Worcester, entering by the valley of the river Stour, is the only level road leading into the town. Most of the other roads pass through deep cuttings moade in the rock.
The natural result of such a position is that all the central part of the town is closely built, and aU the old streets are very narrow and confined. To reach a space sufficiently cpen, and sufficiently easy of access to make it saitable for electioneering purposes, it is absolutely necessary to go to some distance from the centre of the towvn.
The " long narrow street"-Mill-street-to which your article refers, is the main road through the town to Shrop. shire and the north-west. At the Park Butts the road divides, the main street forming the Bridgenorth.road, while the other, "the lane which led from the hustings to the town," is the road to Bewdley. The former of these us d to be the route of the Liverpool coaches, the latter of the mail.
The places hitherto selected for the hustings have been, Lt the elections of 1832 and 183S, an open field at the top of the hiU on the road to Bridgenorth, which is now built over; subsequently, Caldwell meadow, on the Worcesterroad, the spot to which Mr. Guest referred; once, if I am not mistaken, a field on the east of the town, which is not easy of access; and, latterly, Blakebrook.
I tnink that it would not have been wise to place the hustings in Caldwell Meadow. Extensive and valaable bbildings have lately been erected in its immediate vicinity cnditisnolongeras suitablea spot for thehustings as it was in 1837 or 1841.
On the other hand, Blakebrook is an open space, rendered c xtremely easy of access by tho intersection of two roads at iigat angles, which afford abundant facilities for the disp-r. sion of a large crowd. Close at hand, and immediately to the right of thohustings, is the Union Workhouse, enclosed within high walls. To this place of shelter it would have bsen, I think, comparatively easy for Mr. Lowe and his friends to make good theirretreat, had theybeen ablo in a- way to anticipate the frightful sceae which was to ensue.
The "heaps of stones pilod by tba side of the lane" were most probably those used for mending the roadL I have frequently soen such heaps on the open space near the slte
f the huastings. A deliberate collction of stonce before. hand for purposes of attask could not have been overlooked by the authorities and the police.
I trust that my intimato connexion: with the townD where my family have been manufacturers for more than 10 yeas, and rcy deep regret at the position which it mi,t nowoccupyintheeyesof iho 0on,try,-maybe iny-exccse for troubling you with thi long letNe.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street.
I COUBT OF BARKRUPTGY, Basinghald-streeet.
I IN RE THE ROYAL BRITISH EANET
Wednesday, A4pil 1.
MBcfore Mr. COMmitsiaonr T1TnT. I-Vn I
This was a meeting for the examination of Mr. Apsley Pellatt, formerly a director of the bank and late XlP. for tho borough of Southwark.
Ylr. Linklater appeared for tbo assignees, and Mr. Vos for Mr. PeDatt.
Mr. PeDatt, examined by Mr. LLLaTEt, deposed that he became a director of the bank on the 12th of February, 1819. Mr. M'Gregor, a personal friend, spoke to him on the subject of the formation of the bank. It was to be formed'under the 7th and 8th of Victoria. The first pro. spectas isnued stated that the bank would be formed on the principle of limited liability, and he thought he should not himself have joined it but for that. Under the charter he was aware it became unlimited. He knew a Mr. Learmouth, who was at the first meeting for the establishment of the bank-, but not afterwards. Did not know any of the other parties. Did not find John Menzies, Esq., there as secretary; never saw him to his knowledge. Saw him once or twice afterwards, but not acting as secretary. Could not say when it first came to his knowledge that the bank was not founded on limited liability. First attended a meeting of the board on the 19th of February, 1849. Mr. Mullins, in consideration of his being appointed solicitor to the bank, had undertaken to pay all the preliminary expenses of the formation of the bank, and a minute had been made to that effect. Did not know that he (Mr. PeDatt) hacl signed this minute. He signed it without reading it. He supposed it was reid. It was pro. posed to commence the bank with a capital of 100,000L On referring to the document produced he found the amonnt was 500,0001. That document was, no doubt, correct, and his recollection wrong. An advertisement would appear to have been issued setting forth that shareholders would inenr no liability beyond one-fourth the amount of their paid-np stock, and depositors no risk whatever. Be that as it might, his impression was that the bank was one of linited liability. The advertisements in the Bankers'
lagazine and Bankers' Circular had, he presumed, been issned by authority of the board. The advertisement was inserted in pursuance of a minute bearing his signature. He always considered the capital to be 100,0001. Did notknow that Mr. Menzeiewas secretary, notwithstanding his name appeared as such in the same advertisement as his own. He always thought Mr. unllins, or perhaps Mr. Paddison was the secretary. [Mtr, Paddi. son.-" No."] Mr. Pellatt adhered to this statement, notwithstanding his attention was caUed to several instances in which his name was thus mentioned. It had been agreed that a Mr.Coulson should be appointed manager of a branch to be opened at Newcastle, on condition of his introducing a certain number of purchasers of shares.
A letter was here read from Menzies to Mnuins, requesting him to sanction by letter the appointment of Mr. Coulson as manager, and suggesting that they should " steer clear of the Union" (a bank at Newcastle), "which had nothing to give, but, beiLg in a mess, would like to be helped out of the mire." (Laughter.) That letter was submitted to the board at a meeting at which he was present. Mullins vrote the reply produced, addressed to " John Menzies, Esq.," sanctioning the appointment of Mr.Coulson, assuming his qualifications to be as represented, and that he disposed of 200 shares.
Mr. LmLxrtmTR here proceeded to make various quotations from letters in which opinions were expressed that the bank must have great success at Snnderland, where the announcement of its intended: appearance had created quite at sensation. (A laugh.) The Union Bank, it was clear, must succumb (increased laughter), and the Royal British would take its place.
Nothwithstanding this correspondence, he (Mr. Pellatt) must stiU say that he did not know Mr. Menzies had ever been secretary to the bank. He could never exctly make out what he was. (A laugh.) He was not secretary, but had a particular mission. (A laugh.) Never heard that on the same day he (Mr. Apsley Pellatt) was appointed director John htenzies, Esq., was appointed secretary. He would again say that he thought Mr. Menzies went to Sunderland, not as secretary, but on a special mission.
Mr. LTh'KLATEiR, in further examination of Mfr. PeUlatt, here read another letter from Menzies, dated Sunderland, conveying the information that he was fast, and wanted 101.-he could not move without it. (A laugh.) He must have this, and the prospects at Sunderland were so bright tnat there would be a clear profit of 50,0001. a-year from that place. (Great laughter.) After that letter had been read, he (Mr. Pellatt) would still persist in saying that he did not know that Mr. Menzies had acted as secretary. He was no party to this correspondence between Menzies and Mullins.
Another letter was read from Menzies, recommending tlitm to keep clear of certain shoals, and stating that he was working hard, but could not get on so well as he wished for want of the charter. Mr. Mullins could have no idea what this charter would do for them. Parties were only holding back from taking shares on this account. He did not like this lukewarmness. The charter must be had.
The fol owing resolation of the bank was here put in evidence:-
' The secrtary read a letter from Mr. Dickinson, of Newcate, sugge3tina that he sboUld retire to the north, with the view of assisting Mr. Coulson aLd Mr. Dickinson in Dlacinz the shares on which lxr. Mu1hns advanced 11 ga nesa. Resolved, that in reference to this and other conmmunications rectived from NeWeastle, it apr necessary thbt the iecretary should retire thither and aivo Mr. Cmeron a meeting thTre. Mr. Menziesisthereforeauthorizedto complywiththerequest of the fewcastle shareholders and to take an early opportunity to go thither, and remain untU recalled."
Notwithstanding this minute, Mr. PeDatt, further examined, said he must still deny that he knew Mr. Menzies acted as secretary-he had a doubt of it.
Mr. IiaN.KLA .-Wobody else has.
The CoMISSIoNER.-This minute was made on the 11th of May, and in June Menzies was in Whitecross-street prison. (Great laughter.)
A letter, of which the following is a copy, was here put in:-
" ensHea Inn, N~ewcastle, May 9, 1819.
"My dear Sir.-You wi sIee that oau member, Mr. Headiam, aimed a direet blow at the prospectus of the British Bank in tho House the otter evenincg, especlaly referring to Its circulation In certain quarters, doe &tless m.'aing Newcastle, when It was calculated to mislead. Now. althougb I for o,e am prepared to defend tbe sebeme of the Brtish
tank in al1 its details, yet I cannot help feeling that some of our frends here, from their great zel in forwarding the projecc% and in their esgemess to overcome a difliculty, have admitted, It not pro. pouneed. a principle which the prospectus of course does not warrant in the Fenso contended for by the peoDle of NeweUatle-namely I limited Itability to) the shareholders, Irrespective of the masuase. meut of the bank.' This is to be regtted, and of its bad effocts I h ve saready had some proof in Mr Dunn ha-ing repectfiull decliire dtal;irg hares in consequenceof thatmisLmnderstalnutig.
*Tbe principles of tbe rojected bank are so tound and admitof such clear elucidation, tha I have a strang desire to sond a short letter tothe jo)urnal this week on theabove point: and In connexion with ailr. Hesdiam's remarks, on the other hand I see some little danger ini mooting the qucation until the promised aharebolders are secured down, here I see, bowever, that when the bank shaU be establibed so far as this distrust is cnceemed, that matter must be put upon a soulnd footing for ihe sake of depositors. Mlr. Hawthorn froINurdte position. did not come into town to-day. Mr. Betton wi accompany m.out to his house in the momiJng.
'Mr. West has taken five shares, and his brother-in-law will take other Lye.
, In haste, I am yours sincerely, O CU O John Menzies, Esq."
Another letter was put in in which Mlr. Menzies acknowledged the receipt of 501, from lMr. Owens, a new director. This was handsome (a laugh) ; and, again, he hoped some.
thing might be done that he could again make his appearance at the bank, he being then in prison.
Mr. Pellatt said the first information he had of this incident was on perusing Mr. Esdaile's evidence as given at Ibe last sitting. The reason the bank was not established at Neweastle was that shareholders could not be obtained, The minute produced enabled him to say that a considerable number of shares were taken at Newcastle.
hir. Ln;KLATER again referred Mr. Pellatt to an advertisemrent setting forth that its commencing capital was 1Wi,G0OO., with power of irndual increa3se to 2,000,0001. The na's es of Edward Esdasle, Esq. John Gwynne, Esq. Aciilles James Hertz, Esq., ; Willam Daniel Owen, Esq.
Apsalsy PcUatt, Esq.; Thomas Ritchie, Esq.; Archibald 8pens, Esq.; and Charles Walton, Esq., were put forth as directors ; also, another advertisement containing this paasaoe:-
*The cArital belng subscribed, no farther shares can be Issued, and all alotinent lettersw vaicb have not been resporded to are canoelled. lItLa exrr'ctd that the bank WHIl he completely organized and in oPeration by the end of September."
The name of Apsley PeMatt was mentioned in the last-mentioned advertisement as a director, and that of John Menzies, Esq., as secretary. It was very wrong if this was so. These proepectuses might be lying about, but it never struck him as knowing that Menzieg was secretary, (Laughte If he had seen the advertisement he should have obje to it.
Mr. IANICLATER.-I can show you prospectus after prospectus.
Mr. Pellatt, further examined, said he was present at a meeting on the 22d of June, 1849, when a minute was entered to the effect that the Crown should be petitioned for a charter. The following words occurred in the said bpetition:-
"That the said deed has been executed by the hoMdern of more than ono-half of the shares in the said business on whicl not les than Â£10 on such share has been alrady pad up, and thatthbLsaddeed so executod is annexed to the pretent Petit lo
HIis (Mr. Pellatt's) name wasthe last on the list of directors signing this petition. He took no pains to ascertain whether the statements contained in this application for a charter were true. (Sensation.) He signed the petition withont reading it. (" Oh, oh 1") lHd no means of ascertaining whether the statements were correct or not. Had every reason to suppose they were correct. The date of the cbarter was the 17th of September. Was present on the 27th of July when a statemenat was made showing that the deposits had not been duly paid up. Was present on the 3d of August, when the secretary reported that the Royal approval had been obtained for a charter, and that it wouid shortjy Nb) granted.. The following was contained in a minute oF the 3d,of August~ l'849:-

On further examinatioF Mr Pllatt said, if he had
[wronly aopte tha mirr. i W*Sfrom carelessness,
(Exclamations.) He knew the tertlntfMs Of thie crtera and that certain payments sbould be all duly paid up before the bank could commence butinews.
Mr. LliXLATEPB hero referred to the certificate of th goverDor and directors of the company that the comp;an
c dwith the provisions of the 7theand 8t
Victoria, which'contaioed this passage :-" ThaSt one.ha'i of the amount of each share hadi been paid up in resect of each of such shares." That was irgnudhy Mr. Ieliatt and others.
Examination continued.-At the time he did not recol. lect that Cameron's promissory note had been taken for shares. He knew that the actual money was not in poses6. sion of the bank, but thought the amount was correct lesg t1e preliminary expenses. He did not know that the bank bela promissory notes instead of cash to the extent of 7,0C01. and upwards. Mr. M'Gregor told him that there had been a sufficient compliance with the requirements with the Act, and the minute had been made that the rE lirements of the Act had been dulycomplied witb.
Mr. LUiLAUER here read a minute shocwingthat the preliminary expenses were 9,0001., and that there was only in the Bank of England an ictual cash balance of 26,0001.
Examination continued.-It would appear from this that Mr. M'Gregor must have been wrong in stating that the .Act had been duly complied with and he (Mr. Pellatt) had thus affixed his signature under a wrong impression. (Hisses, and other marks of disapprobation.) He signed the document without reading it.
Mr. LnINLATXR hero produced a book containing this passage in an advertisement:-
* Tbhat the tiUes selected i the British Bank, to be incorporated by chartEr; the capitl tobe in ares of 1OO e;ch, half of which is to he paid up before the business is commenced, and tho roeponsibility limited.,
-He (Mr. Pellatt) had understood until the bank failed that the iability was lmited
Mr. LINRLATER.-You have already said that it was somo time after you joined the bank that you ascertained it was not limited. You now say yoa did not ascertain this until after the bank had stoppod.-Had a notion that the liabilty was limited to double the amount of the shares subscribed for.
Mr. LINKLATn.-Whero in the name of Heaven did yoa get that notion from?
MIr. PeDatt.-I think it was in a Bil which Mr. Card. well, or moro likely Mr. Lowe, introduced.
Mr. LrNEA xTEn.-Bnt not passed, and therefore became lawf I (Larghter.)
Mr. PeUattI.- think there is a Bill of that character stiUl which is the law of the land.
Mr. L1NKLITEIL-You have been rather an active member of the Legislature with reference to education, have you not ?
Mr. PeLatt. -Perhaps i.
Mr. L LTAT M- fact, it s one of those services for wbich you hoped to obtain another seat ?
Mr. Pellatt.-I do not think it has anything to do with the subject, and therefore we will not indulge in those expectations.
Mr. L rATKR.-StiU I must confess you so surprise mc that I cannot help it. Then your notion was that there was a liability to double the amount of your shares?
Mr. Pellatt.-Just so.

Mntllatt.-I was not awaro of that.
Mr. LmaaATXB.-I suppose you took care to tel the public that if aman took a share for 1001. he would be iable for 2001., and no more ?
Mr. PelDatt.-I did not. I told the public nothing.
On further examination Mr. PeDatt said his attention had not been led to a statement in one of the reports that shareholders were liable only to the extent of one-fourth their shares. Hereliedonthecharter. (Alaugh.)
Mr. L0xLATEn next referred Mr. Pellatt to a minute that "the services of John Menzies, sq., as secretary be discontinued from that day," andaked Mr. Pellatt whetherhe was not one of the directors who had agreed to pay Mr. Menzies 4001. as secretary. Mr. Pellatt admitted that he wa (Sensation.) He must stil however deny that he had ever recognized Menzies as secretary.
Examination continued.-Mr. Cameron might have been in the north.

Edward Mulns, Esq.-
Examination continled.-He never knew of Cameron having thus got the money necessary to commence business. The letter certainly shoved something like borrowing a sum of moneo necessary to cormnce business with.
The oMi'ssIoxim said he did not see how Cameron's letter could bo connected with Mr. Pellatt, unless it could be shown that it was laid before the board.
Mr. LINATER.-It is necessary that I should put the question in ord.r to completo evidence whichwillultimately have to go elsewhere. (0lappings of hands.) Do you, Mr. Pellatt, recollect how soon after the opening the certficate had been given of the 16th of November?
Mr. Pellatt.-What do you caull the opening? Do you mean the commencement of the business.
Mr. LwKCATX .-Yes.
Mr. Pellatt.-I don't know that I was there. I might have been.
Mr. LIMkATER.-Do you not recollect the dinner in the evenmg ?
lfr. PeDatt.-Yes.
Mr. Ii;NKLAmR.-And the prayers in the morning. (Laughter.)
Mrr. Pellatt.-I had nothing to do with that. (Hisses.) That was Mr. Cameron's own affair. (Laughter.)
Mr. ILNKILATa-You proposed a toast at the dinner?I dara say I dlid.
Was this the toast: The friends and well-wishers of the Royal British Bank, particularly those connected with the London and provincial periodical press." (Laughter.)
Mlr. Pellatt.-It wvas.
Mr. LrKLATR,-And in your speech you went on to

Mr. INhKLATM- Were you fortunate enough to get one of the medals of the bank ?
Mr. Pelbatt.-Yes.
lMr. LINKLA&ER.-And you preserve it as a memento ? Mr. Pellatt.-I do. (A laugh.)

Mr. Pellatt.-Very possibly, but I do nQt recollect.
Mr. LINKLATER.-Then you saw the bank's rcing g Mr. Pellatt.-I thought so.
Mr. LW'XLATZR.-When you left the bank at the end of 1850, did you believeoit not to have lost one-fourth of its capital ?
Mr. Pellatt.-Did believe it had not lost one fourth of its capitaL Ile could not say that he gave great attention to tbat particular amount, but he left it, as he considered, safe and solvent. He resisted an advance on theWelsh Ironw orks He thought that an unbuisinesslike banking transaction. He went down personally to inspect the manes, and that led to his resignation as a director. There ws due from directors and officers of the bank, at the bank, before he resigned betwveen 25,0001. and 30,0001. His resignation as a director w as conveyed in the foflowing letter:-

[The list produced of what the directors and offioers owed the bank had been handed to him, conzfdentially, beforehe retited.

Mr. Pelatt.-I do hot know that he tught to have signed his name there.
Mr. Voss.-I have no doubt that Mr. Pellatt has been misled.
Mr. Pellatt.-Mx. Paddison can tell you how far he was or was not secretary. It muS not dopend on my evidenoe.
Mr. IaiKsman tle.-Sir, I had intended to proceed today with the examination of orne or two of the officers- of the company for the purpoee of their giving evidence as to those parts of the case with reference to which Mr. Apnvsy Pellatts memory is not quite so tenacious as one could have denired ; hut one cannot surbrika at it, seeing the length ofltime which has elasedsinen oleftthedirection.naraely, in the year 1853, but it is now toolatein the day, and Imust therefore reserve, ifyour Honour w permitme, for another occasion the formal evidence which wil be necesry for the purpose of showing that at the time the petition for the charter was prented there was not the netesmary nuaber of signatures on which the 101. hpa been paid, and also with reference to the capital account on the 16th of Novemher, when the certificate was given thatthe whole of the 50,m00on
had bemn subscribed. I will reserve that for anothere oa sion. I have now concluded with Mr. Pellatt.
Mr. Peah att.-I should like to submit to the Cofmmnis sioner how far there is anything affecting my character, my interity, or my hone It is possible that I may have erred,asv mnysgentlEmen tdo attending public boards and having a great *ay breards and other buchness to attend to,in otgoig itothese details and fact which many
mighteousay it wasmyduty to have done, and I regret I did
not. I went afrd that bank, as I considered, to aid the class ofmiddletraesmen and others who would have tryinegMr.elatadvantag, Iand been taken from loan societies, and ad ho avanageof discounts at a moderate rate. I had no perial to serve. I held balances in the bank, and I helped theahank rather than the bank helping ne. (Applause.) Therefore, hav in no motive whatever
aissle upon the pubic cdid not conceive that l so of the on the contrary, that I was conferring
benefit. I hop teublic antelearrned Commissioner,
ind friends generally,l will consider that I wm free as a man be donour and honesty from any charge of deceiving or injurig the public, except that, perhaps, of not paying suho trnt attention to my duties -withreference to the maitters that wore going on as I ought to have done s I must throw myself upon the feelings of the public and the Court. I had a great desire to act honestly, however erroneously it might happen that I did act. (AppIause.)
Mr. Yosr -I amn afraid that Mr. Pehiatt has nade the mistake, which is often made, of confiding in men unworthy of trust.
otr. c requiesT.-We are not here for the purpose of trying Mr. Pellatt. I do not think it will be foun to be immaterial to examine a gentleman in this court whose signature appears to that which one cannot help calling an untrath on more than one occaion, because it certaiy does appear that Mr. Pelatt was a party to the advertisements ; his signature appears to documents which are certainly mtorrec t, he is a party to advertisements which misled the public, not only with reference to the lmited iability of the company, by which advertisements many have been drawn in and ruined, but certainly be has been a party to the iscung of the advertiosements of the final al. lotment of shares at a time whien-there is the record standing agains him-he knew well that thei vhole shares had not been allotted. I am only Answering niow, as it seems to be my duty on behalf of the assigness to Answer, the observations which Mr. Poellatt has made. I have no desire whatever that the least odimu should attach to bu Pellatt or any other person beyond tbat which the necessity of the case requires. But it wiu be for the public to judge, as Mr. Peslltt ha ainvited this discession, awthter a gentleman who has sought the honours of the Legila. ture, and on whom therefore the public placed more than ordinar reliance, having regularly joinedl this bankhaving mivited perons to join by representations with referento to the responsibity which is not borne out by fact, contraou to law, contrary to the charter-having signed his namie to the petition and certificate with reference to the state of the fuids of the bank, also not borne out by fact; -I cannot help thinking that these facts alone, when Mr. Pellatt comes t consider the qpuestion (he has now probably seen them, as be sa, for the prsnt time), wil show that he has been gulty of something which disentitles him to the full expression of A pprobation that he -would desire ; but one cannot help feeling this, moreover-that whoe Mr. Pael latt found that so large a sum had been invested in the Welch mines, which he admits to have been an) thing but abanlding transaction, and which has been the cause finally of the downfall of the bank, coupled with the fact that the directors and offtiers of thre I nk were to his own
r.owledge indebted, instead of putting his signature to the petition to the Crown, on the 29th of October, to issue other shares amounting to 500,0001. t sems to me that it would have been his duty, at all events, to have remained passuve, and not to have been active in keeping up theadelusion er which the public were as to the prosperity of this bank.

Mr. ocaddison.-The statement I have to mafe upon that point is entirely of a nkegative kind. Mr. Pellatt observes twice in tho cotrse of his answers to your questions that the secretary referred to in the particular minutes might have been mMr. Paddison, and on one occasion I think the date of the minute was the 27th of July, 1849, in which there is an expssion that the secretary, inx the absence of Mr. mu rhins, did so and so. Mr. Pellatt specifically observed tuere that it maight have been mlr. Paddison.t now. the statement I have to iake with regard to allthese suggestions is this, that I never was present at any single mAeeting of the promoters of this bank- previous to the time of their obtaining their charter, nor for some timelafterwards, that is previous to the 17th of September, 1849, nor for some time after the 17th of September, 1849, I never was at any single meeting of those promoter.. And on the occasion referred to in t at minute of the 27th of July, 1849, it is quite clear to me that the secretary referredl to in the absence of Mr. Mullins could certainly not havea benmsl.My own impression was from what I heard at tW ie htM. enzies was the secretary, and thaLt he alone was the secretary. I am further informed (this is not my wn iret vidnce b a ler wo is now in my ser. vic, ad wo Ibeleveis ncort,andcan give his ow~n evi. dene i reuird,tha th orginl inues hic Mr. Link. late ha prducd o th meeing prvio~s o Otober or ~ov,sne,~389, urig he holpoiodof heformation

The clerk lreferto is Mr. George Shand, who is now m my semce, and at that time a clerk in the firm of which I was a partner, Mullins and Paddison, and employed by Mr. Mullins to transcribe the minutes from draughts given to him.
George Shand was then sworn, and stated that he knew Mr. Ienries, and that he copied the minutes in the book; that Mr. Menzies acted as secretary down to the 29th of September, 1849. bis name is published in all the prospec. tuses of the bank from the beginning as being its secretary. The prospectuses were lying about in the bank parlour, and he bad seen them there.
Mr. P611att.-My impression was this, that I ksa never seen Mr. MenyAes acting as secretary at the bank, and further than that I did not recollect ever having sen hin em. cept when he called upon me in referenceto - upou the bank.

LAW REPORT.
ADMIIRALTY COURT, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1.
THE 'URMNIE.-COLLISION.
(1cforc Dr. LUsHINGTOX.)
This was a suit promoted by the brig Olinda, of the burdeu of 257 tons, against the brig Uranie, of the burden of 191 tons, to recover the loss arising from a collision between them at 1015 a.m., on the I2th of November last. The Olinda was proceeding from Toulun to London, laden ,with provisioxns, &c.; the Uranie was bound from Newcastle to Martinique, coal laden. Both vessels, fromn the tempestuous state of the weather, were brought to anchor in the Downs, and they mutually charged eachm other with driving and thereby causing the damage complained of.
Dr. ADDAMS and Dr. Twiss were heard for the Olinda; the QUEEN'S ADVOCATE and the ADInnALTY ADVOCATE for the Uranie.
The learned JUDME, having conferred with the EIder Brethreu,by whom he was assisted, said they were of opinion that the Uranie did not take the precautions necessary, and was therefore to blame for the collision.
Decree accordingly.
THE LINDA FLOR.-COLTLSIOIN.
The Hanoverian bark 3laarburg and the Portuguese schooner Linda Flor came into collision with each other at 3 45 a.m. on the 3d of October last, in the middle of the Brown Bank, abreast of and distant 55 miles from Yarmouth. The bark, of the burden of 345 tons, was bound from Hamburg to Bordeaux, and thence to Cadiz. The schooner, of tho burden of 130 tons, was proceeding from amburg to 0 porto. The bark alleged that it was a fine clear morning and a ship's light could be seen distant a mile, and a ship without a light about half that distance. She descried the schooner four or five points on her port how and kept olose to the wind. The schooner, when 23)
--is off, was observed to be bearing away; but when at 1_ distance of 100 yards she suddenly luffed up to the wind and thereby rendered a collision imminent, in consequence of which the bark put her helm hard aport to lessen the effects of it, but the schooner ran into her, doing her groat damage. The schooner pleaded that the weather was so thick with fog and rain that the crew, when stAnding at the stern, could not see her bowsprjt. The bark was suddenly discovered distant barely the length of the schooner, and before any stop could be taken for avo,iding a collision the bark ran into her. Cross actions were entered by the
br. Adams and Dr. Twiss appeared for the bark * Dr. Bayford for the schooner.
The ELDER BRETIREN imputed the blame solely to the schooner.
The C our.T pronounced accordingly,
Insolvent Debtors' Court, April 1.
I*NSOLVENT DBBTORS COURT, April 1.
IN RE AUGUSTUS POCOCK.
(Before Mr. Commusioncr MURPHY.)
This insolvent was heard in November last, when the case was adjourned for amendments to be madie in the schedule. He, now appeared for adjudication.
Mr. Sargood opposed, and Mr. Reed supported.
The complaint of Mr. Timewell, the opposing creditor, a tailor in Duke-street, Sit. Jamues's, was that he had been induced to lend the insolvent 1301. by meanis of fraud. The transaction complained of took place in 1845, when the insolvent oneo day called upon Mr. Tirmewell, and said he was in a difficulty, as he was reqiuired to lodge that day the purchase-money for a commission for his son, anid be wae 1301.
deficient. Mr. Timew'ell, not having the amount by him, borrowed it of a friend and hianded it to the insolvent, who, instead of paying it to the Horse CGuards, gave it to General Whbito, who retained it on account of a debt due to him. The in'solvent then left town, andi Mx. Timewell was unable to find himn until 1852, when he was discovered at Ports. mnouth and rerved with a writ. The inisolvent pleadedt to the action and thereby caused the plaintiff about 291. law costs in recovering a juxdginent. The insolvent was not taken unitil May last. It was f urthe-r complained that the insolvent had received at one timo 8001., which wouldl have enabled him to discharge Mx. Timsewell's debt had he been so inclined.
Mr. Commissioner Mmmruvy, fis giving jud3ment, said the cae was one of most patent swindlinig, an , although the insolvent hadl been in custody since October, yet the greater portion of the imiprisonmnent had been roluntary, in order, no doubt, to anticipate the remand, on the pleasantestb side of theprion,TheCout culdnotallw scha case to pas withut pnisment anda jdgmnnt wuldtherefore he renuncd wichwoud polog te iprisonment for some Rmrter ime Th inolvnt oul hodischarged at the expirtio of10 aledarmonhs romthe vs mtng order in
MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Wednesday, April 1.
MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Wedn esday, A pil 1.
The April quarter sessions for the county of liddlesex commenced this morning at Clerkenwell, before Mr. PASELEY, Q.C., Assistant-Judge, and a bench of magistrates. There were 43 prisonera for trial, 34 charged with felony and 9 with misdomeanour.
The ASsISTANT-JUDGE charged the grand jury.
William Atkins, 19, was indicted for stealing a "eapot and other artioles, the property of Susannah Richer.
The evidence clearly made out a case of housebreaking. The prisoner committed the offence with the aid of two other persons, who eszaped.
The jury found him Guilty, and two former convictions were proved against him. He had been sentenced to 6 months' and 12 months' hard laboar.
The AssisrsNT-JUDGE sentenced him to four years' penal servitudo.
John Browning, 41, was indicting for stealing four silver forks and other articles, value 71., the property of Thomas Wilinson, in his dwelling-house.
The prisoner pleaded "' Guilty," and mado an earnest appeal to the Court to be dealt loniently with, on the ground that he had not premeditated the offence, but yielded to a temptation which unfortunately and unexpeetedly had been placed in his way.
The AssISTANT-JUDGE said this was as bad a case as he had ever met with. From what was before him it appeared that the prisoner had been convicted of uttering a forged order, for which offence ho was sentenced to 10 years' transportation, and upon his release from that punishment, by some means he found out the prosecutor, a gentleman who generously and benevolently rendered assistance to persons situated as he then was who wanted to return to honest pursuits and lead a good life rather than resort again to a career of crime. The prosecutor kindly promised to exe-rt himself in his behalf, believing him to be a reformed man, and desired him to call again, teUing him he would in the meantime endeavour to procure him emaploymient under his rent-colleetor. Wthen he did call again lie took advantage of the absence of the servant to fiU his coat-pocket with plato, and his detection was owing to the servant noticing a fork sticking out of his dress. It therefore seemed that the prisoner was so constituted by nature and custom that he could not abstain from crime, and under aU the circumstances the Court thought it a case which must be punished with considerable severity, though it was not necessary to pass the extreme sentence the law allowed for such an offence-15 years' transportation. The sentence was that he be kept in penal servitude for six years.
John Turner, 16, was indicted for unlawfully attempting to steal a quantity of biscuits, the property of the London and North-Western Railway Company, his employers.
Mr. Metcalfe was counsel for the prosecution, M1r. Ribton for the prisoner.
It a,pn* .red that the prisoner was ernployed at Haydonsquare, aud was detected in the act of attempting to break open a chest of biscuits, but under circutnstanices which made it cldea that he expected it contained somoething more valuable. When asked what he wa doing, lie said he was only looking for "Jack Robinson." g`
Thejury fonnd the prisoner Guilty. He was sentenced to 21 days' iniprisonmeent.
Isaac Morris, 34, a German Jew, was indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the dwelling-house of Mutell Castleburg, with intent to steal goods and chat' els therein
The prosecutor stated that he was a watchmaker at 45. New Castle-street, "Vhitechapel, and he was acquaintei with the prisoner, but only casually as a customer. They were both of one persuasion. On the evening of the lOtn of March his shop was closed between G and 7 o'clock, with the exception of one shutter, which was left down to let in light, and soon after he noticed persons looking through after which the shopdoor was tried. For the purpose of seeing if, as he suspected, a robbery was contemplated he concealed himself in a corner, and no sooner had he done so than the door was violently forced open with a crowbar, and after the lapse of a few moments the prisoner entered aid went direct to a drawer where he (procgantor) kopt M y<brs. There were about 701. worth in the drawer at thauntinuo. As the prisoner was trying to force the drawer he pounced upon lum like a cat upoa a mouse, and said, " So you come for to rob me ?" The prisoner said he had not, and begged hard to be allowed to go. The prisoner said, " Let me go; I am a Jew," but he would not isten to any such plea, and calling for aid, one of his lodgers came down, and the prisoner was given into custody. No pro.
The lodger alluded to deposed that on hearing the prosecator call out, " Help ! Help ! Iv'e caught a thief," he ran down and saw him holding the prisoner.
The prisoner, in his defence, said ho had been at the prosecutors house on several occasions to play at caTds with a friend, and it was for that purpose he went there on the night in question. Seeing tbe door open he walked iu, when the prosecutor seized himt and said ho was there for thieving, bust he was not.

CIVIL COUPvT.-(Before Mr. JuIstice WILLES and a
common Jury.)
DALTON V. BATCHELOR AND ANOTHER.
Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Keating, Q C., and Mr. Phipson for the defendants.
The plaintiff in this action was by trade a painter, em. ployed chiefly in painting ships in the dooks at Newporb, and he sued the defendants, Messrs. Batchelor, timber merchants in the same place, to recover damages for a very serious injury occasioned by the negligence of the defendants' servants. It appeared that on the 7th of May, 1856, the plaintiff was passing along a public highwav near the docks at Newport, and was obstructed by a load of timber which the defendants' servants were hauling from the docks into the defendants' timber-yard. When the plaintiff came up the timber was stationary, but the defendants' foreman giving the order to move on, the timber-carriage started again, and the timber giving a sudden lurch, knocked the paintiff down, and crushed his ankle in a frightful manmer. Tbe defendants' servants seemed more attentive to the timber than to the plaintiff, who was allowed to lie on the ground about 20 minutes before he was carried away and attended to. He was confined to his bed foe two months, and for four months afterwards was unable to walk without crutches. The present action was then brought, but in the course of the evidence it appeared that the timber was not hauled by the defendants'servants, but by hauliers employed
bva man named James, who was present atthtiean
urecting the oPerations.a the time, and Mr. Justice WILLEd said the haulier James was the party responsible for the manner in whieh the timber was
Mr. WHArELEY said the defendants' foreman gave the orders, and the horses went on; and he contended the defendants were liable for the act of their servant.
hlr. Justice WILLEs suggested that the facts should be put in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court.
After some further discussion it was arrGnged that the plaintiff should be nonsuited, leave being reserved to the
laintif to move the Court to enter a verdict in his favour tor such sum as the learned judge should fix.
His LORDSBIP then examined the surgeon, and, havlng ascertained that the injury was not permanent, fxed the damages at 1001.
THIB DUKE OF BEAUFORT V. WILLIAMS.
Mr. Reating, Q.C. and Mr. Somerset appeared for the plaintiff; MIr. YIuddleston and Mr. Pbipson for the def endant.
This was an action of ejectment brought by the Duke -of Beaufort to recover a piece of ground of about eight acres. The question was whether the land in question was included in a lease granted by the plaintiff'i ancestor at the end of the last century.
After a protracted trial the jury found a verdict for the defendant.
CRIMINAL COunRT.-(Before MIr. Justicc CROVDMc)
William Dark, aged 26, labourer, and Mary Dark, a.ged 24, were charged with assaulting Henry Harris, and stealing from his person four 51.-notes, three sovereigns, two halfsovereigns, some silver, and other articles, at Abergavenny, on the 19th of November, 1856.
Mr. Cleave appeared for the prosecution; the prisoners were undefended.
It appeared that on the day in question the prosecutor, Mho was a farmer, had been attending the Abergavenny fair, and between 6 and 7 o'elock in the evening he got unpon his horse to proceed home, being a little the worsofordrink. When he had gone about half-a-milo on the road two women came up to him, one on each side of the horse, and took hold of the reins, and also of his coat, asking him to go down a lane with them. He strauck them with his stick, and one of them called out " Jem." The prosecutor was immediately knocked off his horse by the male prisoner, who knelt upon him and rifled his pockets. They then all three ran off together. The urosecutor awosr nnaif.1v;1v +^. 44a A-^^ JI: ^.

The male prisoner, who is a very powerful-looking man, cross-examined the prosecutor with great acuteness, but for a lOng tiuo was unable to shake his testimony. He, however, persisted in his cross-examination, and eventually eclite that when tho prisoners were first taken before the magistrate they were discharged, because there was no evidence against them. The prosecuttor was present, but was not examined, though, as he now stated, he never had any doubt about their identity. This, however, was denied by the poisceman, who said the prosecutor was not examined

Philip Lloyd surrendered in discharge of his bail to take bis tris on a charge of committng a rape on the person of Mary Ann Wiliams, at St. Mellon's, on the l2th of Decem'ber, 1856.
Mr. Davis appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Skinner defended the prisoner.
The particulars of the charge are too horribly disg-ting for minuto description. It will be sufflcient to state that the prosecutrix is a young woman aged 14, who had been living wvith the prisoner for three years as 6ervant. The prisoner is a married man, living with his wife, who was described as a " pretty young woman." According to tho prosecutrix's statement, the prisoner, by exhibiting a carvingknife, and threatening to split herhead open, forced her on four several occasions to yield to his wishes in the presence of his wife, and on one occasion he compelled his wife to sit on the bedside and hold a candle. On one occasion, according to the girl's statement, the wife was a consenting party. In a day or two after the prisoner turned his wife and the prosecutrix out of doors, and the prosecutrix went to her sister's and made the chaTge. A, surgeon was theo

William Doble was indicted for stealing a post letter at Taunton on the 27th of November.
Mr. Poulden was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Edwards defended the prisoner.
The case for the prosecution was this. The prisoner was a subsorter in the Taunton post-office. In Novem. her numerous complaints were made of letters being missed, and Mr. Coffin, tho postmoster, determined to detect the thief; accordingly he made up a letter having in it a marked sixpence, and put three seals upon it. He dropped the letter into the letter-box, and it was the duty of the prisoner to empty the basket into which the letters droppe , and then to hand the letters to a clerk named Stephens. Mr. Coffin had not put a stamp upon the letter, and therefore it was to be charged, and it was the duty of the prisoner to hand it to Stephens. He did this, and Stephens looked at it and observed that it was crumpled at one corner, and he saw that one of the seals had been broken, and on trying the letter he found there was not any coin in it. Stephens took an opportunity of coramunicating with Mr. Coffin, who caUed the prisoner into his private room, and producing the envelope asked the prisoner if he bad seen that before ? The prisoner at first replied that he had not, but at last admitted that he had. Mr. Coffin said there was coin in it, and he asked the prisoner if he harl a sixpence in his pocket. The prisoner produced a aixpence, anLd Mr. Coffin said, " If that is the sixpence it is marked O' and, u oking at the sixpence he found that it was mmrked. The prisoner was then taken into custody.
The defence was, that the sixpence had fallen out of the leter, d the prisoner hasd picked it up, and in the hurry
Ofbuiness had puxt it in his pocket, intending to account for it at the close of the day. The prisoner was educated at the Exeter grammar school, and received a most exoellemit character.

NORWICH, TUM9DAY. MARC i31.
m -ne cornmassons for the county of Norfolk and the city of Norwich were duly opened this morning at the early hour of half-past 9 o'clock,. by hr. Justice Erle, his lordship and most of thehbar having arrived overnight, yesterday being a blank day at Bury. After attending Divine service in the Cathedral, the criminal buminess of the city was commenced at 12 o'clock. The calendar contains the names of 14 prisoners, charged with four burglaries, three cases of felomous wounding, one of forgery, and three of larceny.
(Before Mr. Justice EAnIE and a C* Juwr-.)
Charles Thwaites, aged 30, -was indicted for stabbing Richard Stubbs, on the 13th of September, with intent to do some grievous bodily harm.n
Mr. Evans conducted the prosecution; Mr. Power appeared for the defence.
The prosecutor is a labourer who, having received his "largesse' money on Saturday, September 13, came into Norwich to spend it. Chance led him to a low publiehouse in the city of Norwich, where were assembled soame men
and women, After a while the prosecutor and the prisoner got into a quarrel, and the former, seizing the latter by the throat, swung him to the ground. A scuflle ensued, in which the prisoner drew a knife, and inflicted a wound, three inches long and two deepj on his thigh. The prosecutor exclaimed, " He has almost cut off my leg," and retired upstairs. The landlord and the guests then proceeded to execute Lynch law on the prisoner, who was beaten and knocked dovn by the landlord with a heavy poker, while.the guests pommneUed him with their fists, and took away the knife from him. The prisoner then sent for a policeman, and in the result the prosecutor was taken to the hospital, and the prisoner to the gaol, where he has lain ever since.
The jury having convicted the prisoner of the felony, he was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, his long incarceration being taken into consideration.
Edmund Story, aged 13, was indicted for feloniously stabbing Arthur Hannant on the 22d of February last.
Mr. Simms Reeve was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. CaTlos Cooper appeared for the prisoner.
The prosecutor and the prisoner were both at thelTorwich Theatre on the 22d of Febraary, anid after the entertainment the prisoner asked the prosecutor to pay him a debt of 5d., to which the prbosecutor replied that he had not got any money. The prisoner said that that was a lie, whereupon the surrounding boys proposed that they should fight it out, and pushed the prosecutor up to the prisoner, who thus received a blow on his face. No fight, however, ensued, and the prosecutor walked a\way homewards. He had not proceeded very far when he saw a playbill on a waU, anuhe stopped to read the announcement for the next evening. While go engaged the prisoner ran at him, and gtruck his f me with an open knife, the blade of which penetrated through the cheek into the mouth of the prosecutor. He afterwards rpeated his blow, and stabbed the prosecutor on the breast.
The jury found the prisoner Guilty of unlawful wounding.
Wiliam Davison, aged 13, was also indicted for the offence of felonious stabbing.
Mr. S. Reeve prosecuted.
The prisoner w/as undefended, but on his own behalf stated that the prosecutor was always bullying him, and that on the occasion in question he was attacked when he was eating some bread and cheese, and that he struck the prosecutor without recoliecting he had his open knife in hisl
The jury found this boy also Guilty of unlawful woundint only.
'entence deferred.

Mr. Polvim applied in this case for a bench warrant. Mr. Justice ERLE granted the application.
It is understood that the circumstance out of which arose this charge was connqgted w~ith thie celebrated " Holt R>abbit Case," which has been going the round of the Incal press for some time pas$. It. is e.xpected that the noble ~efendant will remove the case into the Queen's Bench by certiorari, end that the indictmuent Will be tried at the
oulr aasizes.
Riehard Appleton Clarke, aged 54, was indicted for orging and uttering a promissory note.
Mr. rower was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Couch appeared for the defence.
The prisonerhas been for many years the secretary of the Norwich Operative Loan Society, and the charge against him was that, being an intended borrower of 151. from that society, he hadforged the names of three persons as sareties for the repayment thereof. The case was very clearly proved by the alleged suretiese who denied that they had signed the iustrument on the faith of which the directors had advanced the loan to the prisoner. The note so giveD, in accordance with the rulesof the society, stipulated for the repayment of the loan by weekly instal-menta at the rate of ls. per week, but the date at which those in,talments were to commence was not. filled in, while the note itself was without date.
Mr. CouvH objected that this instrument was not a valid promissory note, as no date was given at which the liabWity of the parties giving it was to attach.
MIr. Justice ERLx was of opinion that as against the prisoner it was sufficient, but he would conside.: whether he would reserve the point.
The prisoner was convicted without much hesitation, and sentenced to four years' penal servitude.

POTTr A-D OTHERS, ASSIGNEES, &C., V. LAWE.
Mr. Knowles, Q.C., Mr. Tomlinson, and Mr. Fernley were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Hill, Q.C., and ir. Temple, Q.C., for the defendants.
This was an action of trover by the assignees of Mr. Wright, a bankrupt, to recover the value of certain goods and machinery of the banklupt. The defendant by his pleas denied the right and title of the plaintifflito the goods.
The bankrupt had carried on the business of a cotton. spinner since 1843. Onthefllth of July last the defendant, a banker at Preston, came to the mill, and seized the whole of the machinery and goods there, Zad carried them away and sold them. The mill was formerly in the possession of a Mr. Welsh, who in 1847 rAortgaged the machinery to Messrs. Lowe and Law, cotton-brokers, in Manchester, to secure 15,0001. They. becoming indebted to the National Provincial Bank of England, transferred this security to that bank. In September, 1853, the bankrupt Wright pur. .hased from Welsh the miU and machinery subject to the mortgage. In May, 1855, the National Provincial Bank were creditors of Lowe and Law for above 9,0001., and were paid off by the defendant, who took a transfer of the mort-
g"e bankrupt, his late foreman, snd the defendant were examined at considerable length, to prove the above facts, and as to whether the debt owing to the defendant had not been hquidated by paymaents into his bank by the bankrapt
who kept an account there. Ultimately the case resolvea itself into the question whether the deed of mortgage operated to convey only the machinery on the premises at its date, or extended to the goods and stock there and the after-acquired machinery.
A, verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to a special case for the decision of the Court above.
In the Crown Court Mr. Baron MAxRT has been occupied aU day trying a charge of murder against two men at LAncaster. The case was still going on when our parcel was despatched, and we therefore reserve our report.
(Before Mr. BLIss, Q.C.)
William Kilner was indicted for having, at Barton-upon. Irwell, committed a robbery,. with violence, on the person of Mrs. Massey, the wife of a gentleman living at Barton, on the night of the 18th inst.
Mr. Torr appeared for the prosecution; Mr. C. H. Hop. wood defended the prisoner.
It appeared from the evidence tbat the prosecutrix was returning on the night in question to her own house, situate about a mile fron the station of the railway by which sbe had come from Manchester. The house was approached by a carriage drive, which led up to two gates which shut in the grounds of the house. As she proceeded up the drive she heard footsteps behind, but did not turn to see who it was. When she arrived at her own gate she was seized from behind by the neck. She struggledhard, clinging to the gate, but was ultimately dragged some yards from it, and a basket, containing various small articles, was taken from her. Mrs. Massey was unable to identify the prisoner as the man who so attacked her. Her cries after the man had left her brought her servant, Martha Williams, to the spot, who found her mistress in a state of great exhaustion, black in the face, and with blood coming from the nose. She was then holding a s'rap or belt which she had clung to and broken from the person who attacked her. A cap was also found near the spot.
Both these articles were conclusively shown to belong to the prisoner, and other witnesses proved the fact of his being near the spot a short time before.
The prisoner was found Guilty, and sentenced to six years' penal servitude.

The prisoner was remanded.
Frederick&Sisel, who had beenz remanded upon the charge of stealing a gold watch of the valae of 20 guineas from Mr. Henry Coo er, a warehouseman in Gresham-street, fas again brought Up.
It wil be recollected that the prosecutor stated at the last examin*tion that onx Saturday last, during the excitezent and bustle consequent on. .the city election, he was standing in ling-street, looking up at the window of one of the committee-rooms, when the prisoner suddenly snatched his watch,. tore it from the. guard, and passed it to somebody close by, who succeeded in getting off with it The case was clearly established against the prisoner by several witnesses, one of whom saw the guard from which the watch had been torn in his-hand at the moment be was seized by the prosecutor.
The depositions taken at the last examirnationwere read over and signed, and the prisoner, who loudly protested his innocence of the offence w ith which he was charged, was fully committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court.
WEsvnnSTsv-A few days ago Eliza Higgins, a young woman stated to be on the town; was charged at this court with cruelly deserting herinfant, only a month old.
It appeared by the evidence that at about 11 o'clock on the previous night William Tiddersly, coachman to Count Batthyany, was passing through Hill-street, Knightsbridge, wnen e heard a feeble cry from an area, and, having paused to listen, felt convinced that it proceeded from an infant. He immediately went in quest of a policeman, and finding Wllam Dayborn, 177 B, in-Charles-street, took him back to the spot whence the cry proceeded, when the constable, on climbing over the railingo of a floorcloth factory and descendiing to the area, between four and five feet in depth, found an infant Iying on the ground, with no' other covering than a bedgown. The infant had a black eye and- bruise on the side of the head, and on being taken to St. Luke's Workhouse, Chelsea, was recognized as belonging to the prisoner, who had been confined with it in that establishment, and had left that -morning. From inquiries made respecting the prisoner, Dayborn succeeded in the course of the same night in apgrehending her at 34, Queen-street, Chelsea. She told ergeat Wright, an officer of the B division, when taken into custody and informed of its -being for deserting her child in Hill-street, Knightsbridge, that it was quite correct. On the accused being- brought to this court the child was also produced, but was in so precarious a condition that Mfr. Paynter directed it to be immediately conveyed back to the workhouse and there taken every care of, the prisoner being remanded until yesterday to await the result, when, upon the case being called on, the police stated that the infant was dead, and handed in a certificate from the medical officer of the parish, statinz that it was impossible to arrive correctly at the cause oR death without a post molr&m exanination.
Mr. Plinyi,= remanded the prisoner, who appeared to be fully sensible of her serious position, for a week.
aC sENWx,.-W iliam Brown, an elderly,respectably. dressed man,.was charged by Mr. Lyon Lyons, master shoemaker, of No. 32, Chiswell-street, Finsbury, with robbery.
The prisoner was employed by the prosecutoras " cutter

He was stopped and searched, and the property found in his possession. He was given into the custody of 112 G, and takentoth station-house, when he gave his address No. 6, Union-street

SOUIWAR.-George Moore, a seaman belonging to the Fisgard man-of-war, was chaTged wi'ph being drnmk and creating a disturbance at the North Kent booking-office, London-bridge.
George Graves, Fs const4bIe ini the employ of the railway company, said that about five minutes to 5 on the previous afternoon he was called into the booking-office, when he saw the prisoner and a number of his companions making a disturbance. The prisoner was druqk and making use of disgusting language towards thq booking clerlk, and so misconducted himself that he caused considerable inconvenience and delay to. the express. train, which ought to have started. Witness was compelled to take him Into cutody.
Lawrence Bennett the booking clerk, said he was issuing tickets for the 6 o'clock express train, when the prisoner came up to hi.n and demanded to go by it at third-class fare. Witness told hiin he could not go by that train, when he made use of very disgusting ond tbreAtening language,and was so violent that he was compelled to send for Graves to remove hIntr. fact, the prisoner's conduct was so bad that it prevented witness from' perfQrpsing his duties, and the consequence was the delay of the express train.
Thomas Sutton, a servant in .the co.mpany's employ, said that the prisoner struck him as he was assisting Graves,
In answer to the charge, the prisoner said he was entitled to travel by the express train, and was rather aggravated at being refused.
Mr. COMB}: told him it was proved that he was drumk, and the railway officials were nght in refusing to allow him to travel in that state by the railway. It was also proved that he had committed an assault on one of the servants; therefore he must pay a fne of 10s., or in default of payment suffer 14 days' Imprisonment,
LAaNroETn.-A decision was given by Mr. ELLiorr of the utmost importance to cab proprietors and their drivers.
Some days ago a person named Wright, a cabdriver, was summoned by Mr. West, his master, to show cause for neglecting to pay over the sam-of l0s, the earnings of a cab for one day, agreeably-to a written agreement which he had entered into with his employer. On that occasion Mr. Wontner, who appeared on the part of the defendant, admitted the fact that the money was due, but hoped, as his client was about to become a martyr for his fellow cabdrivers, that his worship would order his commitmen to Horsomonger-lane Gaol, and not to the House of Correction, Wandsworth. The learned gentleman proceeded to say that it had been the practice for some considerable time at this court in cases like the present, when orders were made against the drivers, and a commitment made qut that they were to pay the amount settled upon or be imprisoned for a certain given period, to send the persons so convictedito Wandsworth House of Correction. This course.he considered most unjust and oppressive, for while in reality the matter in dispute and a2judicated on was in all respects a matter of debt, and the pnsoner should therefore be treated asa debtor, he was, on the contrary, served asthough he had been a common felon. He was inthefirstinstauceputintoa bath, inthe next hishair was cut off, and, in the third,- he was compelled to wear a mask - in short, he was treated- in every respect as though he had been a notorious felon. In the county of Middlesex cabdrivers committed for similar offences were treated in a very different manner. They. were, in fact, treated as debtors, as debtors they really were, and entitled to their discharge the moment the wages-duo were tendered and paid; and he (Mr. Wontner) considered it a most monstrous bardship tbatpersons should have their hair cut off and be obliged to wear masks in one county and not in another. In conclusion Mr. Woutner requested that his worship, having the power, as the Act of Parliament under which the proceedingshad been taken mentioned, the "Common Gaol or House of Correction," would send his client to Horsemonger-lane Gaol, which was the common gaol for the county, where he would be treated as a debtor, and not to the House of Correction, Wandsworth, where he would be served as a felon.
M1r. ELLIOTr admitted the justice of the request, and assured Mr. Wontner that the fault did not rest Vith the magistrates, as they had no discretion in the matter, and his (Mr. Wontnerb) complaint would have been more properly made to the justices of the county. Formerls the class of persons to whom the defendant belonged used to be sent to Kingston. Gaol, but on the opening of the Wandsworth House of Correction both Kingston and Guildford gaols had been done away with, so that at present there were only two prisons in the county, that of Wandsworth and Horsemonger-lane. By the Gaol Act of the 4th of George IV. the county justices alone had the power of making all rules and regulations for the classification and management of these gaols, and by their order so- made there were only foiur casses admitted to Horsemonger-lane Gaol-namely, persons who stood committed for trial, persons under remand, persons committed in default of bail, and deserters. By a similar order the regulations at Wandsworth were confined to one uniform practice, and therefore the magistrate at this court, while compelled. to send a non-paying cabman there in default ofr payment of his wages, could not interfere in any way with the discipline. He (Mr. Elliott) thought with Mr. Wontner that the Legislature never could have contemplated that persons committed under the Hackney Carriage Act for arrears of wages should be subjected to have their hair cut and wear a mask, and therefore he should take time to consider the point, and see the other magistrates on the subject.
Yesterday the par es again appeared, when Mr. ELLIOTT observed that on looing over the written agreement between the parties it a)ipeared to be a mere contract for the hire of a carriage from day to day, and nothing about its earnings, so that it aul=unted merely to a matter of debt, with which hethe m rate) had 'nothing to do. Addressing Mr. wontnerj ie said the question raised was one of considerable irnportce to a numerous class of pal-sons, and one which he iconsidered most advisable to be brought before the matlstrrtes for the county of Surrey at the next Quarter Sessidzs f or their consideration.

The Examination Statute, which was promulgated in Congregation towards; the niaddle of the present term, having undergone an extensive revision at the hands of the Council, is now once more printed and circulated for the Consideration of the Unmversity, preparatory to its re-promulgation in the course of the ensuing term. The chief alterations are the following :-1. The entire new scheme for the " Moderation " Ex naination is given up, and it is proposed that the examination shall continue exactly as at present. 2. The scheme for a further subdivision of the Final Schools is dropped; they are to remain four, as at present-the sabjects of poetry and scholarship being restored to the Classical School, from vwhich they were removed by the Statnte of 185L A compensation clause is also introduced into this school allowing the award of a First Class to candidates who have greatly distinguished themselves in any two out of the three subjects of science, history, and scholirship. 3. The clause allowing two Examiners out of three to rant a Testasusr is withdrawn. 4.

Morocco.
MOROCCO.
TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-As a reddent for noinconsiderable periodin Tangier, the consular residential town of this empire, I have read with much pleasure your remarks on the treaty brought about by our able and energetic Consul-General, Mr. Hay, which I do not hesitate to say couald not have been acoompUshed by any other man, so exceedingly difficult are the Moors to deal with or manage in such affairs. He isof extra. ordinary powers of-mind, of great inteligence and firmness, and a thorough ind fluent AYbic aeholar. I consider he has indeed accomplished a great undertaldng.
As you traly BAy, Morocco has been hitherto bat little known to the traveller and capitalist; yet, from its proximity to this country, it will probably, and I hope speedily, receive its share of attention.
There are many articles that might be exported thence (bartered or bought), known only to those who have resided in that country; there are also others, known only to those who, like myself, have lived among the MIoors, not only in the towns, but also in the villages in the interior.
The soil is exceedingly rich and productive, the crops of wheat, barley, Indian corn, dra, and other seeds being most luxuriant. The fig, olive, locust,amulberry,vine, orange, lemon citron, banana, melon, and many other fruits, both Euro' pean and Oriental, flourish there. Vegetables of various sorts are most abundant and prolific, such as the potato, onion, tomata, vegetable mallow, musehroom, watercress, and many others. Very good beef is to be had at something like 3d. per lb., but the mutton is very inferior. Fowls are most plentiful and cheap, as also are eggs. The milk and butter are both very good, and in the wet season, which lasts several months, the milk is excessively rich,- so much so that I have, when up the country, after scalding it in the morning to keep it through the day, found in the evening a thick crust of the most delicious cream, quite equal to that made in Devonshire. It would occupy too much space to enumerate all the products, but I will name a few that occar to me on the moment:-The indigo plant, dyes, cotton plant (of which I have specimens equal to South Sea), cork, valonia, galls, tobacco, snuff, hides, skins, wool, hemp and flax, goats' hair, saffron, millstones (very hard), oils (olive and others), lime (that when dry will not rub off), honey, wax, &c. One of the most valuable productions of Morocco is its minerals, hitherto comparatively undeveloped, though known to be of great richness and of easy working. The folloving, from my ownr personal inspection, abound:Copper, lead, antimony, manganese, iron, plumbago, and Last not least, coal, which might be worked at great profit, and supply the dep6ts ef Gibraltar and Malta.
These few remarlS MLay not b uninteresting to the public as relating to a coantry and people rarely heard of here. As we ought always to give credit where it is due, I must say that in all the dealings I bave had with the Moors I never was insulted during my stay with them, as I scrupulously avoided interfering in any way with their religion or customs. Ihave more than once traveDed a day's journey (accompanied only by my wife) on horseback with perfect safety, and should uot hesitate So do so again. I was alwavs well received and treated in the interior, ad occasionally supplied them with physic or plater for ounds. I am certain that Europeans would live in perfect safety in any part. If yon think these few observations worthy of insortion they are at your service

Destruction Of Darby's Firework Factory.-
DEsTrUCrIoN OF DABuY's FmREwoum FAcToRy.- Yesterday morning, at an early hour, a fire. attended with a Eerious loss of property, happened in the premises belonging to Mr. E. Darby, firework-maker, of No. 98, Regent-street, Bambeth-walk. The premises in which the misfortune commenced were fonr floors high, including tho basement, the lower rooms being weU stocked with fireworks, while the upper parts of the house were occupied as sleeping rooms. On Tuesday night two of Mr. Darby's sors went to bed one of th top rooms, and a female servant named Broad retired to rest in a room on the same floor. Shortly after I yesterday morninga policeman of the L Division, while standing opposite the premises, had his attention directed to the kitehen or basement floor by hearing tm unusual noise proceeding from that part of the house. The constable immediately crossed the road to seo what had occurred. He had scarcely tinme enough to get to the railings of the building than he became aware of the dreadful nature of the accident, for several gross of smaU fireworks, F-tch as squibs, catherine-wheels, Roman candles, and rockets, had exploded. At the same time sheets of flame of various colours shot forth from the windows. The officer immediately sprang his rattle and called out "F ire I" bat some few minutes elapsed before he could make the occupants sensible of their danger, and not until the flames had taken complete possession of the staircase, thereby cutting cff aU means of retreat. The three persons having gained
cre of the front windows begged of the people in the street o ran off and fetch the Royal Society's fire-escape, but while ibis was being done a ladder was brought, raised in front of the house, and their lives were happily saved; the escape arriving within a few minutesafterthey had been resc u. The X ecessary intelligence having bcen sent to the various en
houses with aU possible expedition, the Largo engine o- ing to Messrs. Hodges's distillery, that of the parish, and
thers of the London Brigde, West of England Insurance Company, &c. attended. The firemen thea found the flames issuing from every window in front of the building, and at frequent intervals loud explosions ensued, Fortunately the fireplugs of the Lambeth and Southwark Water Companies yielded aplentitul supply of water, and the fremen eventually had the satisfaction of seeing the fire diminish. This, however, could not be accomplished until the whole of the manufactured stock in trade, the prepared compos'ion, &c. were destroyed. Fortunately the gunpowder nvas kept in a magazine away from the houee. The loss is very considerable, and Mr. Darby was not in. nure& for cither stock in trade, furniture, or the 'ut d- ing. tihe ,ame premis:s have scfered in a similar ranner onroneor tw-o previous oecasioes.

The Royal MalCompany's steamer Atrato had err ye out at St. Thomas and left for Jamasica on the 18th inst. at 8 a.m. T~ho Trent wsat Carthagena, with her intermediate shaft broken. (lThis,accounts for the non-arrival of the Trent, with the Spauish Main mails, at St. Thomas, prior to the last homeward steamer, the Parana, leaving for Southampton.) The Clyde was at St. Thomas, for the Spanish MIain. The Eagle left Jamaica, on the 10th of hacfor Honduras. The Conway was at Barbadoea; the Dee on the Spanish Main route; the Wye and Derwent at St. Thomas; and the Solent on the Gulf route.
At Greytown were Her Mfajesty's ships Cossack, Archer, Victor, Intrepid, and Pioneer.
At Barbadoes, HIer Mbajesty's ship Brilliant; and the Tartar was en route for Jamaica.
At Jamaica, Her Majesty's ships Imaum, Termagant, and Mariner.
At Greytown, the United States' corvette Saratoga, and the Cyane at Colon.
The news from Jamaica exctends to the 13th inst., the day on which the steamer left. MIatters were at the time ex;ceedingly dull in a commercial point of view, but the sugar crops for the ensuing year presented a very cheerful aspect, and gave every indication of yielding good retmrns to those engaged in the cultivation of that product. His Excellency Mr. Darling, the new Governor, was anxiously expected. " Parties are apparently lying upon their oars (writes our correspondent) and know not what course to pursue under the present regime, there being, virtually, no responsible chief in the island, as the Lieutenant-Governor leaves everything to hisE xecutiveCommittee, who are absolutely deficient in the requirements necessary to contitute a well-organized Government. From bad legislation the inhabitants groan under the most oppressive taxation, which can be ascribed to no other cause than incompetency on the part of the Legislature. The present state of things, however, from what can be seen, will speedily work its own cure under the vigilance of our expected Governor, who ought to be well iniformed upon all subjects conducive to the Interest of this country." The Legislature was not in ssion, and it was generally believed woulld not meet before the usual time in October next. The island wras very healthy, and tranquillity prevailed everywvhere.
De Cordov;a's Mfercantile In telligencer- of the 12th quotes coffee at 39s. Sales of alewvives are noted at 26s. In flour no wholesale operations had been effected since last issue. Very little mess pork at market, and prices as last reported. No fresh American corn at market; island growth realized 4s. per bushel. Sugar, 23s. to 20s., according to quality. Exchanges on London-90 days, i-per cent. prem.; 60 days, 1 per cent. prem.; 30 days, 1* per cent. prem.; private bills at par. On New York merchants' bills were 1 per cent, prom.
At Demerara the cholera was abating; in the city it had nearly disappeared, but still existed with a degree of viuence in some of the country villages. This was nothing more than might naturally be oxpected, the villages being all undrained. Mr. M'Allaater had been elected a financial representative for E.ssequibo, in the room of Mfr. Alty, resigned; and Mr. O5'Donoghue, financial representative for New Amsterdam, in the room of Dr. Henery, who had taken his seat in the Court of Policy. A pr,ivate of the 2d West India Regiment, named Samuel L.ewis, was executed on the 7th of March for the murder of a comrade named James Roberts. A n application was about to be made to the Combined Court to grant a sum of 16,0001. to increase the railway plant, and put the line in efficient working order. Trade had been very dull among the merchants durin,g the fortnight, owing chiefly to the epidemic. Freights were scarce-to London, sug,ar 2s., and ruan 3d.; to i&verpool, sugar 2s. 6d., and rum 3jd.
Coffee at Barbadoes was in abundant supply, and selling at $12 per 1001b. Cocoa, $12 60c. per lOOlb. Flour, $9 per barrel. Irish butter was scarce at 240. per lb.; American, 21c. The quantity of sugar shipped to date was 2,213 hogsheads, 135 tierces, 304 barrels; molasses, 279 puncheons,
At Grenadla the labours of the Legislative session had terminated in two days, durnug whichbrief period the annual Money Bill, initiated this year by the Executive Council, was passed in a Rouse composed of a majority of Executive Councillors, as the originators and supporters of the measure, and forwarded to head-quarters. Thne Bill imposes a land-tax, payable by proprietors, at the rate of ls. per acre on properties not exceeding 60 acres;Gd. per acre between 50 and 100; and ld. on those measuring over 100 acres; and also a 10s. license for the year for selling charcoal and sugarcane. These imposts had caused considerable dissatisfaction, and they were viewed as of a tendency to bear very unequally upon taxpayers. It was expected that Governor Hincks would veto this Money Bill, and the RCetrenchment Bill was anticipated to sbare the samne fate. At Royal Order in Co uncil, dated the 2d of February, had been received, giving Her Majesty's sanction to the Act of the Island Legislature for constituting anExecutivo Council of Government. Lieutenant-Governor Kortright, who was rising in public favour, was occupied in familiarizing himself with the general affairs and local circumstances of the colony. Agricultural prospects were bright and pronissmg. The weather had been rather wet for sulgar-making. One cargo of the new crop had been got off in the brig Effort for London, and another was to leave on the 14th in the brig Nova. A fair crop of sugar, as to quantity, was expected, and specimens from some of the windward plan-
tations were said to be of beautiful grainy quality.
Captain Raasloff had addressed a public meeting in the Government Council-room at Trinidad, on the Oth of Marcb, in explanation of the proposed submarine telegraph scheme between the Vest India colonies, South America, and Europe. It was resolved, "That the meeting approved the proposed telegraph, and would like the Government to take the matter under its favourable consideration, and to accept the terms offered."
The weather at St. Lucia had been unfavourable for manufacturing purposes, and retarded the ripening of the canes.
At Antigua the weather had changed from wet to dry. The crop would hardly be begun until the close of Mlarch.
Sugar-maldng was proceeding briskly at Malr
tinique, and the price of the article had risen in the island up to 30S. and 32s. 6d. sterling per cwt.
In Guadaloupe sugar was selling at the rate of about 28s. to 32s. per cwt. for common qualities; rum, proof 24, at 68f. hectolitre (about 2d. per gallon); coffee, 2f. per kilometre; there was no cocoa, cotton, or logwood
The French frigate La Cl6opatre and brig La Perouse left St. Thomas on the 5th of March.
His Excellency Governor Schlegel, his lady and aide-do-camp, left St. Thomas on the morning of the 9th of March, in the packet schooner Rosaline, ft gt# Vrix, rcviing the honoura due to his rauk
