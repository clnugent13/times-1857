Henry Rogers, aged 37, master mariner; Wiliam Miles, aged 27, seaman; and Charles Edward Soymor, aged 25, seaman, were placed in the dock, ch:rged with having, on the 6th of June, 1857, on board a certain ship caled the Martha Jsne, then on the high seas, feloniousdy, wilfull and of their malice dorethought Idlled and mturdered one Andrew Rose, A seman on board the veseeL Tne cout was greatly crowded during the hearing ol the case. Mr. Attorney-General Bliss, Q.C, lr. Edward James, QC., nd Mr. Seymour appeared on beialf of the proseeu. tion. r. Monk, QC., defended theprisoner Rogers Mr. APinall defended the other two prisoners. fr. Attorney.General BLSS, in stating the ca5e for the pro6ecution, said,-The three prisoners at the bar sand indicted for that they feloniously, wilfully, and of their malice aforethought kIlled and murdered one Andrew Rose between the 11th of May and the 5th of June in this Year. The prisoner Henry Rogers Wu the mater of the ship on board which the offence was committed. The pXisoner William Miles was Chief mate, and the prisoner Charles Edward Seymour was second mate of that ship. T4e deceased wes an able seaman on board that ship; and the means of death were a series of violences and outrages committed by the prisoners at the bar upon the per. son of Andrew Rose from the 11th of May until two or three days before his death, and finally by On, extraordinry ct of violence and outrage, within three days after which he died. The Martha Jano is a British ship, owned at Sunderland, and had sailed from Hartlepool last year to Calcutta, where there was a change of masters; and from Calcutta she came on the homeWard Toyage to Demerara, and after leaving Demerara, she put into Barbadoes to repair, and there there wasg nother change of masters, and there it was that Henry Rogers became the master of- the ship. It w. also there- that a considerable change of the crew took place, and there it was that Andrew Rose, the deceased, entered on board thehip. He entered on the 29th of April as an able seaman, and h; signed the ship's articles, which stipulated among other things for a crtain allowance of provisions. When he care on board the ship he WAsfirstputtodosomedutybythesond mIte,who foundfaultwithim and whobeathim,and hobeat Rpee so severely that Rone was advised by some of the crew, to leave the ship,and he accordingly ran away. He Was awsy from the ship for several days, but on the 9th or 10th ef May he was brought back by the police, and he ws put in irons. The vetsel siled on the llth of May. At th,at time he appears to have been released from irons, but the day after the vessel siled he was gain beaten by Seyn4our. The chief mate also best him on that day with a rope's end and a whip, and the captain also beat him on that day. From that day until the last act whicb terminated in death, I believe he was beaten by some one or other of the prisoners almost every day severely with a whip, both when he was in irons and when he was o0t of irons. Besides this there were other acts which I sball dethll to you The deceased when he came on board ship was apparently an able seaman and in good health; but he had his hair closo cropped, and there is some reason from that and from his conduct to surmise that his intellect had been in some measure dranged. He was fond of singing, and soon after the ship had sailed one morning, when he was in irons, he as singing, and he sang ' Oh, let us be joyfuL" It was on Sunday moring. The captain bade him be silent, and he was silent; but the captain said, " I will make you sorrowful," and he got an iron bolt of considerable size, he thrust it into the mouth of the deceased, and the other two prisoners, the chief and eecond mate, tied it round with some rope or yarn behind his head, and he was kept with that gag in his mouth for about an hour and a half. The captaiu had a dog on board, and he taught the dog to bits the deceased. He first set him on the deceased with a command to bite that man, and afterwards when the captain came forward with his whip to whip &e decasd the dog would fly t hinx and bite him. Hebit the deceased's legs apd feet, and upon some occasions the blood spouted out. Upon one occaon he bit out a piece of flesh and as the deceased put out bis hands to protect himself the dog bit them. Upon another occasion the deceased was sent aloft for some purpose-I believe to furl a sail-and when he came down be was sent up again He 1was then naked, and as he was sent up with a bucket of water the chief mate on that occasion followed him up, and with his whip he whipped him all over his body so everely that the blood ran from several places 'Upon another occasion when the deceased was in irons he asked to go to the bows to do a necessary act for himself. I must here mention to you that the deceased seems to have lahboured under such an infirmity as disabled him to contain his excretions, which came from him voluntarily ci' unconsciously,oriu such a manner as hecouldnot, or, it m$glht be, would not, prevent; and upon one occasion, when hewas In irons, he asked leave to go forwrd for that purpose He was refused by one of the mas upon wh h himself on the deck. The mate ther beat hi he rled tain beat him, but the captain al8o toe o menttowhold the deceased down on hisbac, and he called for a spoon, but he did not use it, but he tookan, iron pin and foicod the excrement of the deceased into his monthforcing opeu his mouth with the iron pin-and thrust it up his nose, saying, " Is it nice r" and " You shall have more of it," until those who were called in to assist shrank awFay, unable longer to witness the revolting scene. day or two after that the same thng again occurred Upon aother ccasion the captain Called the carpenter to kuclc t4e head out of a water-caak, apd s the carpenter was nob quick enough the captain and makte did it themselves It was a water cask of smaUi ae; the smallest water cask, I believe, on board the ship. They then brought the deceased Bose to the cask; they put him into it; they bade him crouch down. Theyfastenedthe head on the ask and turned it, and they then rolled it backwards and forwarde, the deceased beng inside, without any means of getting ir except through the bunghole, which was on the bilge. They then lashed the waterosak to the side of the ahip, and. these he remained from 12 at noon till 12 at night. While he w& there he begged for water, and expressedl great cries of distress. One of the men went to him, and. gkve him a little pea-soup, by pouring it into his mouth. lhe captain was verY angry, and derganded who bad dbne it, and turmed the man away. Another of the men gave hima little water; and he complained of having suffered much from excessiveheatand suffocation. The last occasion on which he so suffered, for it seems to havebeen the act which terminated the cruelties he received from the prisonets, andprobably you will fmd it terminatea also the sufferings of the deceased, was this :-The deceased was told by the captain, " Bse, I wish you would eitherdtown or hang Yourself." Rose answered," I wish you would do it for me," upon which the captain and the two mates took him to the mainmast. They got a rope and they made what was called a " timber-hitch." They put itoverhis neck and hoisted him up, so that his teet were from one to three f;et from the deck. He remained supended by the feet for about two minutes, his face became black, his eyes protruded from the sockets, froth came from his moutb, and they let him down. The moment his feet touched the, deck he feU flat as if he were dead, and the captain was heard to say by one of the crew, that if they had kept him there half a minute longer he would have been dead. This seems to have been the last act of their outrages, and. the last act he had to suffer. Rapidly after ehis his. health sank. The crer got him down to the forecastle, but he ws so crazy that they were obliged to tie his hands. He remained in the forecastle a day or two, and on the inorning of the 5th of Juno they got him from the forecastle on the deck to wash him. The deceased could scarcely crawl. He lay down on the deck with his head towards the hatchway, and his feet to the scuppers. The vessel ws pitching, the water came over his legs, and lie died. They do not know the exact moment of his death, but an hour or two after they brought him up they found him dead. The state he was in at that time was this --He had wounds All over his body from the beat. ipgs and cruelties he had luffered. His woundshad fetered, and be was in such a state that the crew was loth to touch him. They dragged him ift with rope, and in about ai hour afterwards by order of the captain he was thrown overboard. The ship made land next moruing, and arrived at Lierpool on the 9th of June. Information was given Of this afraIz, nd the captain and mates were arrested. The cPtsit when he was arrested, said that he long expected it, for that fellow Groves hadBaid he would do sometbing of the kind. Groves was a seaman, and the captain afterwards imputed to him violnce to the dece=p6d, and sid tbat he had done no ban but to whip him for being dirty. The priBoner Seymour said that the lse said about it was the elter, and Miles said nothing.

PARUAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HIOUSE OF LORDS, THUBSDy, AUQGUST 20. -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~i_e LoRD CEKNELLoR took his seat on the wooliack at I S o'clock. TE8 OPIUh TR&DE. The LORD CHANCELLOR stated, in reply to a question pnu by the Earl of Shafte,bury, that, parsuant to the engagement into which he entered with the noble earl, a tase in reference to the opiumtrade had been submitted ta the law offloers of the Crown. Considerable delay hPd i how,ver, taken place in scertaining what the facts reAd-y 'were, and. with that view the teas via laid, befoee the ('.urt of Directors of the East India Company previous to boing submitted to counsel. The case as amended by the Coirt of Directors was then laid before the law officersof the Crown. They suggested that further facts should be stated, rind those having been supplied, they gave their opirnon in the couse of the present month, which would be laid on the table. 'The resalt was that, in reference to the two questiens which had been put to them, the law officers were unanimously of t pinion that there was no illegality in the cultivation or ale of opium by the East India Compuny; and with regard to its export to China, which had gone on from a period dating long before the present cenutiy, though they were of opinion that there wvas no violation of the treaty with China in that respect, it might be weU to maze some alterations, otherwise the Company might not appear to be acting in accordance with the spirit ef the treaty, which might lead to remonstranees. Lord WYNTORD presented petitions from, as wye understood, ithe town-oouncil of Paisley, and from Dnmfries, against the Bill for Tegulating the treatment of lunatics in Sootland. THE DIVORCE BILL. Lord REDESDALE gave notioe bhat when this BiU came up from the Rouse of Ceunmons he would move that the amendaLents made in the other Horse be taken into consideration that day six months. From what he knew of the character of these amendments, the Bil would come up to their lordships an entiry new reeasure, and he regarded it as one of far too ranch importance to be considered at that period of the EeSdon, hien their lordships would be deprived of the assistanoo of those right rev. prelates whose advice upon such a subject would be most valuable. Lord CAM PBELL hoped al the labour which had been bostowed upon the Bil in, that and the other ERouse of Parliament would not be lost, bat that their lordships wonld think it their daty to consider the amendments made in the Bill by the House of Comuons. Lord WYNFORD observed that the engagements of the bihops in their respective dioceses would prevent therm from attending when the Bill came up to their lordships. Lord MO.TEAGLE expressed a hope that the measure would not be applied to Ireland. There were now very few divorces in that country, but if the Bill before Parliament applied to Ireland it would have a tendency to excite irri. tating religious differences. The Dunbar Harbour Loan Bill and the Metropolitan Police Statioos, &c., BWI went through committee. The Eccleslstl3al Commlssion Bill was read a third time and passed. I The following Bills passed through committee :-The Militia Pay Bill, the Revising Barristers (Dnblin) Bill, the Probates and Letters of Administration (Ireland) BilL the MUtiny (East India) Bill, the Joint Stock Companies Act (1856) Amendment Bill, the Parochial Schoolmasters' (Scotland) No. 2 Bill, and the Pimli¢o Improvements BilL The Customs and Excise Bill and the Customs Bill were each read a second time. The Commons' amendments to the Lords' amendments on the Bankruptcy and Insolvency (Ireland) Bill were considered and agreed to. GALWAY TOWN ELECTION. On the motion of Earl GRAB vILLE the House agreed with the Commons in an address to Her Majesty in reference to the proceedings at the late elcotion for Galway town, The House adjourned at 35 minutes past 5 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMEMONS, TIIURSD.&; AuausT 20. The SAER took the chair at 12 o'clock. DrVORCE AND MATRIIO]NIAL CAUSES BILL. The House proceeded to consider this BiU as amended in committee. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL moved the omissioa of clause 18 (added to the Bill in committee), and the substitution of the following :-" Application for restitution of c)nJugal rights or judicial separatiou on any one of the grounds aforesaid may be made by either husband or wife, by petition to the court or to any judge of assize at the asezes held for the county in which the husband and wife re,ide or last resided together, or to the conrt of quarter se_sions of tho peace held for the county or borough ia which the husband aad wife are or were last resident, andwhich judge of assize and courts of quarter sessions respectively are hereby authorized and requiredto hear and determaine such petition according to the rules and reguLations which shall be made under the authority of this Act, and the court or judge to which such petition is addrossed, on a iis hat there is no legal ground why the same should n ot be granted, may decree such judicial aeparation acordingly, and where the application is by the wife, may make any order for allmony which shall be deemed just; provided always that any judge of assize to whom such petition shaU be presented may refer the sanme to any of Her Majesty's counsel or serjeantat-law named in the comrniesion of assize or Nisi Prius, and such counsel or serjeant shall, for the purpose of deciding upon the matters of such petition, have all the powers that any such judge would have had by virtte of this Act or otherwise." The motion was agreed to. Tho ATTORNEY-GENERAL moved the insertion of the followng clause after clause 1S:-" For the purpose of hearing and deCiding a.ll applications under the a uthority of this Act, the judge of asaize or person nominated by him as aforesaid, and also the courts of quarter sessions for any cou;nty, district, or borough, shall respectively be entitled to vai themselves of the services of all officers snd use and exercise all powers and authorities which the court of assize and courts of quarter sessions respectively may employ, use, and exercise for the determination of causes and other matters now usually heard and decided by them respectively, and the said judge of assize or other person, and courts of quarter sessions respectively, shall also, for the purpose, have and be entitled to exercise all the powers and authorities hereby given to the court for the hearing and decidiDg appllcatiuns made to it; and also the powers here. by give; to the court to make provision touching the outtody, maintenance, and education of children, and every order made by any judge of assize or other person, or any court of quarter seEsions, under the authority of this Act, may, on the application of the person obtaining the same, be entered as an order of the court, and when so entered shaUl have the same force and effect, and be enforced in the same manner as if such order had been originaUy made by the court. The court shall from time to time fit and regulate the fees which shall be payable upon aU proceedings under any ap. plication to a judge of assize or court of quarter sesSions or magistrate nnder this Act, and such fees shall be received in money, for their own benefit, by the persons to vwhom or for whose use the same shall be directed to be paid." The motioa was agreed to. On the motion of the ATToRxEy-GENERAL, the words * of blarriage and Divorce" were struck out of clauses 3 and 4, for the purpose of inserting, as the title of the ourt, " for Divorce and latrimonial Causes." The ATTORNEY-GENERAL proposed to amendx lause S by adding the senior puisne judge of each court to the members of the new Court of Divorce. The amendtnent was agreed to, as were other verbal amendmnents proposed by the hon. and learned gentleman. Clauses 15 and 19 of the original Bill were struck out. Upon the clause of the ATrOTRY-GENERAL, in sabstitution of clause 19, for the protection of the deserted wife's property, Mr. HENLEY asked whether the words giving the right of action to the wife avainst a creditor, or person claimiag ,auder the husband, expressed with sufficient clearness the kind of action which was to be brought, and in what court it was to be brought. Also, whether there was safficient protection against the husband seizing the property himself, without the intervention of any agent. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said his desire was to give the wife a ready and expeditious remedy against every perton against whom it was possible to brng an action. it was scarcely possible for her to bring an action against her husband. If the husband obtained and violently possessed himself of the property of the wife, after the issue of the order the magistrate would have power as against the husband, or, at all events, he might be proceeded against in a court of equity. But if the husbaDd, through the medium of another par, which wau moregenerally tho case, endeavoured indirectly to obtain possession of the property, the wife was empowered by the clause to bring an action against the individual so acting, in case the claim was under 501., in the County Court, and in case it we e.bove that sumX in one of the superior courts. The magitrate's order in 5d common eass would be a suffladent protection against the husband, al if there were any. thing more importhe in poiat of property involved, the wie milght be protected at once againist her bwbhand by a court ef eqaitg, on the ground of ber being made afemc sole by theAct,ad theGhusbaNdAweLdbe compelled topayd lthe eostseof the proceediuyg6. MIr. afeCAUhLAY desired forther ex isnatieers as to the adequacy of protection against person,al seizere of the wife"s Property y the husband in the inut nce of a eer woan W The ATTORlNEY.GENERAL sAd the huseand would be exacstly finthe sa9mae potsiotionas& atranger ho> ca fterd husband after the issuing of the order in terfered wth he under the criminal law. Mr. HENLEY sald the special remedy given against the1 creditor seemed to raise a doubt as to the protectioni thee wife would enjoy against the husband. Tho ATTORNEY-GENERAL said the Bill as it now1 stood gave a summary jurisdiction against the creditor. The words he relied on against the husband were those of the present clause, in which it wras stated that the earning, end the property of the wife would belong to her in every areospectt as i shte were afeme sole. Of course,If the partia end tothhe judicial sepaation, and the propet adb3 hlr. ADAMS sugges0d that words hoelad be introduced'. I subjecting the husba-,d to a penalty of fiine or imprisonment hI case he sbould f isobey the order of the courL Sir E. PER&,Y supported the a-mendment. Mr. MALlNS thought that the husband disobeying the order of t).e court should be treated a3 guilty of oenteumpt of court, ar.d should be sent to prison at once. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said he would propose ffse inser'.ion of the following words, which he thought would =*tr4 the wishes of the Housoe -" If the husband in Violation of any snoh order, shall possess himself of ansy such property of the wife, he shal be liable to be committed to prison for a time not exoceeding two 'cendar montis, unless e shall restore the same or pay the full value to the wife, and all the expenses incurred byiet." Atter some further discussion, Mr. AYRTON suggested that the amendment should be withdrawn, and that the protection of the rights of the woman should be left to the operation of the general lavr of the land as it stood, v'wich he contented wouid be foand to be amply sufficient for that purpose. Mr. MALINS concurred in the expediency of adopting the suggestion, which was ultimately adopted, and the amendmnent withdrawn. Upon the consideration of the 23d clause, Sir D. NORREYS zsked the Attorney-General whether a woman who had already obtained a divorce i mnen.sc es thoro would be able to obtain protection for her property by appling to this court. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL rep'ied, that such a person would have all the rights which were conferred by this Bill. In clause 25, Ir. STAPLETON moved the insertion of words providing that a woman should be entitled to a divorce vinS o on the ground of adultery commitled by her husband wvithin two years after she had obtained a decree for the restitution of conjugal rights, if coupled with such continued or renewved denial of sach rights as would enable her to takee further proceedings or maintain a fresh suit for their restitution. He had moved a similar amaendment on a previous occasion, when objections were raised to it, which he hoped he had removed by the form of words that he had now adopted. The amendment was intended to give a divorce a saisculo to a woman who had been deeerted twice by her husbad, or who, having been deserted once, was refused a real restitution of conjugal rights by her husband's residence abroad, or other voluntary cause on his part. To couple desertion with cruelty as a necessary cause for a divorce would leave many ¢ruel cases stiU unredressed. A Lady who was compeled by her husband's desertion to fLnd a refuge in the nouse of her father or other relative, and there experienced greater happiness than she had enjoyed in her husband's home, could not establish legal cruelty, aud therefore, as the clause at present stood, she would have no right to a divorce. Ele believed that by clogging the clauso with desertion for a period of two years the House of Lords had put it in the power of the husband to render it completely inoperative, as, if he ohose to return to his wife once in every two years, she would be debarred from claiming the jast privilege of divorce. He also doubted whether the clause protecting the propertv of married women would be found to Act effectually, for, although there was power to indict a husband who seized the property of his wife, yet if he chose to return home and live with her there was nothing to prevent him dissipating that property. A man who had once deserted his wife might well be supposed capable of making false protestations and vows of future good behaviour in order to delude the wife into a renewal of their cohabitation for his own purposes. The amendment he proposed would, he believed, be to render suits for restitution of conjugal rights more frequent than they were at present, a result that wonld be for the benefit of public morality, and wxould obviate many of the evils which were apprehended to flow from the Biliby muany hon. gentlemen in that House. The ATTORNEY-GENERALt objected to the proviso, which would go beyond the scope and intention of the Bill as settled by the discussions that had taken place. The proviso was then negatived. Sir W. HEATECOTE Droposed to add to section 25 the following words :-" And bigamy shall be t-aken to mean marriage of any person being married to any other person during the life of the former husband or wife, whether the second muarriage shal have taken place within the dominions of Her M{ajesty or elsewhero" The words were ordered to be added to the clause. On the motion of Mr. BUTr, words were added to clause 30, to the effect that upon any petition for a dissolution of marriage the court should have the same power to miake an order for alimony to the wif during the hearing of the petition as in the case of judicial separation. Mr. BUTT proposed to add to clause 40 the following words:-" Nothing in this Act, except when specialy provided, shall be taken to extend to Scotlad and Ireland," The speeial exemptions would be service of processes, summoning witnesses, and enfortement of decrees. Sir D. NORREYS said he should oppose on principle any attempt to exempt Ireland froma the BilL Sir E. PERRY also objected to the amendment, which was subsequently negatived without a division. Mr. CLIFFORD then took occasion to observe, in reference to the 55th clause, that nearly 600 years ago it had been enacted by the Councils of Clarendon, that the clergy must act in accordance with the law of tho land, and that the clause as it stood tended to obviate that prlnciple, and to introduce the thin end of the wedge in the direction of the accomplishment of a severance between Church and Statefacosed which, ia hsio Usu$ opiAon ont not to be taken at the fue JBill was ordered for the third reading at 1.2 o'clock o-morrow amid cheers. SALE OF OBSCENE BOORS, &c., PREVENTION BILL. The report of this Bil Wua also received, and it wax oTdered to stand for the third reading to-morrow at 12 o'clock, a clause having been introduced into it to the effect that its operation should not extend to Scotland, upon the ground that it would be utterly unworkable in that country. The sitting was then suspended shortly after half-past 3 o'clock. The House resumed at 6 o'ctock. PETITIONS. I Petitions were preseted by Mr. SPOONER, from the congregation of 'West-street EPiscopal Chapel, against the adinitssion of Jews to Parlisiment - by Mr. flOi' fromn the inhabitants of Flixhorough and Hifgh wick, Devon, against the Divorce Bill; by Lord Pxv-rsFY, from Dr. Pickford, of Brighton, in favoutr of Mr. Headlam's Medical Professionl Bill, with certain amendments; also fron th9e medical officers of the Ucefleiad'Union, praying for the redressof grievances; from the clergy of the ruLral chapter of Peas. manrh, in Sus,ex, against the abolition of church-rates; and by Mr. JoRN Locics, from the committees a poinated by the vestries of the parishes of St Botolph, Bsopsgate; St. Saviour's, Sonthiwark ; St. Luke's,' and Camberwell, to watch the progress of the Dalwich College Bill, praying the House to preserve to the four parishes thie right of havin twro Governors each for the mangement of Dulwich Coil lege, leavng it for the Court of Chancery or other powers or persons to appoint 11 or any othernumber of governors that may be deemed expedient, POOR LAW (RELAND). Mr. BRADY asked whether mecdical Poor Law officers were boutnd to attend on persons whose tickets of attendanc-e had been suspended in consequence of their ineligibility to Poorj Law relief from positionl and circmstanct,but who af±'crwards got -renaewed tickets for attendaince wthout alteration or dimainution of their pecuniary circumsahnces, Also, whether in theevernt of a Poor Law medic officer fallingd oil i the discharge of his duties, or otherwise, the guardians had power to stop from his Salary the amountt paid by them. for his substitute. - Mr. Hl. HER BERT believed there was nothing to prevent persons from obtaining miedical relief undler the circurnstance in question. The matter might generally be left to the discretion and good feeling of the Dispensay Committees, but some instances of abuise undouhtedly, existed whichL he should be glad to remedy f possible.

Mr. ROBERTSON asked what steps were being taken to comnplete the railway communmieation bewen Ms4ras and Bangaloro. M1r. 'V. SMITH believed that no steps had been taken for coiastrucain this line.

I trust the plans Of Her Majesty's hlinisters will justify these expectatiolns. I amn not entirely -satiefied, however, as to the sources from which their sup. *,p rt is to be gatheredl. The other night iniquiry was m.de ma o watnngt e ereoedfro te Cpe Wo have a -etr cosidrabe frce t te Cpe,andthepolicy of the eCcerarent,whih i to eepa lrge iliaryforce at that yeja, isonecalcinte toexerise nflenei enmergenci,a v~ utlr t th prsen. Bt Ihav neer ear from Her :~iaest's Mnisers heter w rellyare toexpect any Naikstance or any Contribto from the garrson of the 'Cpl e to this army which we are collecting in India, The 3)cs. and gallant general tbe other night press,ed on the )IH use the expedienoy of sending some regiments from the -~Csi e, sand the SecretaLry of the Colonlies, who followed him, I think, said the Governmaent had pointed out the itupor. iarce of thais policy to Sir George Grey, the Gorernor Of A he Cape, and bad left the rmatter to his discretion. I iepeat, I should lie very inuch to know whether Atte G3overnment can tell us whether the Governor of ~-4Le Cap is taking any steps in this emaergency, ,i d wat proportiont of the forcus unuder his control ',he is. preparedt to contribute to our indian army. "-eeianimipression abroad that the Governor of the CA e is not inlined to see his forces diminished, and as the in:l -rtance of the question can hardly be exagge-rated I .Ate ud he glad if Her Majesty'a Ministers could satisfy the llt.Eoa and the country upon the point. We may be told ileie is some danger of a Caffre war. Of course, if we are .-e fficially informed that there is such danger we mu-st give creat weight to the assettion, buat fromn all the information -ikbich reaches me-and which is unofficial-I should Fay Al at thaere is no danger of a Caffre war. Probably at this nz.cment thsere isleas expectationof suhwrta hr a eb n for many years past, and I amn therefore desirous of iltnowing whyso many regiments are retained at the Cape .-at a crisis like the presnt. I ask this question becait,e I remiember that the Governor ofthe Cape ofGood Hope-a ,,_eLtleman of great enery, who has shown on manytocca- :sit rs that be- possesses qualities which entitle himi to -a, nmarnd--was for some timne governor of the settlement of New Zealand, and that during the period of his governornship he maintained the Largest military force that could he os embled in that colony. At one time, I believe, there -wei e at least six regiments in New Zealand, and the pros. .trerily of the colony and the great incerease of revenue wrere perpetumaly pressed upon our attention ; but this tprcsperity turned out to he mainly, if niot entirely, attni. -buse~ble to the expenditure of the large militr force. I -mitw find the samne Governor at the Cape of Good Hope, wvith a still greater militaiy force. I nwta the expen-dii ure of a regiment at the Cape is calculated, on the lowest * e-timate, at 1l0,0VOf. a-year ; and I can understand that a .-geritleman who has the reputation of great energy, And who has a large military force under his comamand, would 'Is, I- if it were left to his disaretion-very miuch indis- LI iEtd to decrease that force. I should therefore be gla ,to learn whether JEer Maiesty's Governieneit-froum gene. myl information, and upon their responsibility-bave giveni eancie definite directionis for the desptch of troops to nDiia firam the Cape than a mere appeal to the discretion cf sh)e Governor. In touchbng on this subject I canniot help rieferring to a point upon vwhich I shouldl have been glad to aear tbe= of hon. geaOtlEmen of theo military profesdeiD to the term of military service of regiments In our colonies. Somne of the regiments sent to our colonies -are kept there a mouch longer time than is just or politic, or for the int-erests of the country. I rememnber that at the t,'snoinnsgdof the ession, an hon. friend of mine asked the 'moh lord opposite whether it was the Intention of the -GovErnment to recall the 45th Regiment from the Cape of -Ge-cd Hope, hut the noble lord replied that he hiad niothinug - to dlo with the disposiitiOn of Her Majesty's troops, and that thbe question was one for the Horse Guards to determine. 'Ib,s is An occasion on which that subject may be referred to, and I must say that the position of the 45th-a regiment of * Sc y high chiaracter- ought not to be unnoticed in sc a dis"ocussion astheprescnt. Theusualtermofserviceforsulafantry regiment in such a colony as the Cape is, I uanderstand, 1(1 vt ars, but the 45th has been at the Capeo for 15 years, and 1 1 elieve there is no prospect of its relief. The consequences -of such service, protracted beyond the intentions of the "Gcvernment and of the country, are most serious and in. juirious ; and if a .egment in these circumastances falls an den a Governor who likes to beatthebhead of an army and lo exercise very great influence and authtority the prospect ef relief is so slight that unless its position is brought -nmnder the notice of such an asembly as this it is likely to ieua&iu without any redress. The 46th BRgisr.ept, which -'went out to the Cape in the expectatien of remaining there 3t0 ears, has already been ona the station 15 years. Thermen ~have nO quarters; they are scatte-red in detachments <{ver South Africa, leading lives of continual hardt-hip; yet lbhey are Englishmen, eflicered by Ergliab gentlemen, and *these is no prospect held out to tbein of an-v redress. .At the commencement of this year, in May, I believe, there 4' ns a sort of uniofficial announcement that they were about fo ibe relieved, and I ami told that the scene which took place between the otfleers and men-s5uch of them, at least, as -could to collected, for so scatterred were the detachments I1 hat it would have required two months to assemble the *tSt ize regiment-affecttd allthose by wheinit vas witnsaedl. I should be very glad to hear that they were going to India to bx siege Delhi or to relieve Cawapore. After unadergoing 7ears of toilsome duty they had no opportunity of gaining pyrcmotion in the Crimea, or of attaininig that distinction wLich all Englishmen covet. I believe the position of this vallant regimenlt is truly heartrending, And I trust the Go-verDnment will consider the circumstances to which I havo -called attention. The hon. and gallanxt Geueral who spoke ini defiiuoe of the Government, and who vindicates his TriE-Lds in a manner which I should be very sorry ~were I in their position, to experience, nas accounted for the reduction of the military ana naval forces of the coulntry on greunada which, I confess, szomewhat astonis,hEd me. I uniderstood from him that the .Government wrere fully sensible that the military forces of the country ought to have been maintained in much greater strength, but *bnat the lonses of Commons would not suppes t the necessary establishments, and that, notwithstanding ,the conviction of the Government that reductions were im. politic and injuoriouis, y et, preferrirg place and power to the .policy which they thought night, they ) ielded their convic.. tiens to a Parliamxentary necessity.Nw,Iain not a sup. pointer of Her lkajesty's Government, bunt if I had the bonour of sitting behind the noble load, Iehould dobim and -lila colleagues the juistice of saying that they ware never influcened by any such conisiderations., I em b'N4e that the present Ministry, or any other Ministry, would upon so psave a subject be influenced only by their opiniolns as to ,what was necessary for the advanitage and welfare of the eutpire. I deny that the itbr f ala MEat who have b~een referred to eeverersexerfcised aalnay ..pressure fromn without," or were not perfectly justified in the cours they adopted. When we were engaged in a nestA expensive anrd arduous struggle, during which no one can pretenid that the Iloctse of Commnons did not give the G-overnment every suppo'-t they required, the memnbers whbo I-at bchind the Government and the Opposition vied In piecing at the disposal of Her Mlbest) 's Ministers all the nes(ays which wrere necessary for brinin the struggle to a suicceWsul issue. That object was attaineld. I la-va before expreissed an opinion, which I now repeat, that the settle. Ii, st of Paris-althouvgh there might be objections to points oUf datail-was such as to give us the expectation of a long iird rerrmanent peace. What was,, then, the diuty of the BIorce of Comimons 1 Our highest function is that of guar. dians of the public purse. Surely, when war had ceased, atid when we wrere told and believrd Chat there was an expectation of an enduring peace, our first duty was to enforce en(lon,y-anid the moat rigid economy- upon the Govern. is., nt, and to-diminish the pressure of taxation -upon the irEcrle as mauch as possible. The Only return we could mnake to the people for the zeal and pat, tothis with which the-y camne fo~rward in the emerge' cy was by shbowing that, 'when the crisis was past, we were mindf-ul of ouir duty as s,teward)s of the public purso; that we were not debatiched t)3 ibe habit which prevails in Parliament during a time of 'war, of easily voting puliliomoney; but that we were prepared 'to enforce upon the Governmetnt a s3-stem of reduct-on anLd economy. This was the first duty of Parliamaent; and it was the first duty of Goverznment, if they believed that .~cace was scoured, to respondl to our wisbtes. 1 say, there. .o7e, so far as the House of Commrons was concerned, that -we actedl moat wisely in the course we took ; becauase, what -excites in temergencies a promopt and paEsionate response to ths appeals of the Governmenit on the part of the com. it unity, who have been described by the inioble lord as so niorlaighted, buxt the conaviction that advantage will not t-e taken of their generosity, anad that when the desiredI me sult has been accomuplished thtir interests will beconisutedl, -aLd that they will be allowed to husband those -resources auhich, if An emergency should again arise, can alonie enable 'ie-m to afrord similar assistance to the Government? It is the economy, the retrenchment, and the reductions of 'taxation effected after a war which enable the cormumuity. -when an emergency egain arises, to come promptly ar-a powerfully to the aid of the Government, ~(Che era.) I conceive, therefore, that when, as members of The lHouse of Commons, we impress upon the Government i Io necessty of reductions, we mierely do our duty; and not enLly do we do our dulty to our constituents, who hAve the ,Lirat claim uponL our consideration, hut generally and ab. s tractedly we Adept a politic course, because we enrich the -~'omrnmnlty, and enable them, :when a necessity again eli-es, to supply the reowurces -whichl may he required.

EAST INDIA. LOAWS. Mr. DISRAELI -would be glad if the President of the Board of Control would give the House any information respecting the precise natmre and secarity of the loans now being negotiated by the East India Company. Mr. V. SM§ITE mid that the lowas negotiated by the East India Company had always been made on the socarity of the revenues of India. The loan was always an op,en one; the total sum to be raised was specified, and the minimum interest was also stated. On the payment of the loan the secretary to the Company gave a promissory note, pledging the revenues of the East India Company for the payment of the interest. With that security the creditors had always been satisfied, and he hoped always would be. LOSSES BE ERROP13 I1TS IN INDIA. The Right Hon. GBENTLE3SLN wished to be allowed to explain that a misunderstanding had arisen with regard to a question put to him on Tuesday night. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Disraeli) had asked him what was proposed to be done with respect to the sufferers in the recent events in India. He understood the question to refer to the widows and orphans of those persons in the civil and military services who had perished by the massacres and he replied that the same scale would be adopted as in the case of persons perishing in action. -His reply showed the impresioes he was under, but did not meet the meaning of the right hon. gentleman's questio3. He was told that the interpretation put by the public upon his answer was that the East India Company had under their consideration a soheme of compensation for the loss of property sustained during the recent mutiny; but the fact was that no such scheme had been in their contemplation. Such a question of compensation opened up a much wider question, into which the directors of the East India Corpany were not prepared to enter. Mr. DISRAELI had confined hisinquiry to property, and had asked whether it was intended to compensate those European subjects of Her Majesty whose property had been destroyed during the insurrection. HOe had not pet his question on the paper, and the right hon. gentleman might, therefore, easily have been misled as to his meaning. He still wished to know vhether it was the intention of the Government to take into consideration the claims of those European sabjeots of HEer Majesty in India whose property bad been injured or destroyed during the insurrection. Mr. V.-SMtITH must reply that the question embraced so very wide a field that it was impossble to answer it without deeper consideration than had been hitherto given to this t THE MMIITIA BILL,. On the order of the day for the third reading of thli Bill, Colonel NORTH said, he vwished to put a question tc Her Majesty's Government with reference to the regiments of militia about to be embodied. It was of very great import. ance to the officers that they should know what regiments were to be selected, in order that they might not be absent from the country in the event of their ovw reginaent3 being caled out. He wished to inquire what rule was to ba followed in this matter, and whether those regiments which had volunteered for service abroad in the late war would have the priority in being embodied at this moment. Thoss regiments who had had the advantage of doing garrison duty, especially iu the colonies, and of being joined for a year and a-half or two years with the line, woald necessarily be much more efficient thau the othersindependent of this consideration the officers of thoso regiments had been put to serious expense in fitting themselves for that service, and it was certainly understood that vhen they returned to this country their regiments would enjoy the benefit of being retained in an embodied state some months after the rest of the militia had been disembodied Notwithstanding this expectation, however, they had been disembodied jast in the same manner as the regiments which had never quitted England. Another point on which he desired Information was as to the new order issued to the miltia in regard to recruiting. By that order the adjutants were enabled to recruit for the line within a circle of 12 miles from their head-quarters. The warrant said, that the recruiting officers should not receive any remuneration, except the sum of 5s. for bringing in a recruit; and it was alo stated in the circular that they would be liable to the same contingencies as the recruiting officers of the line-v,x, in case of the recruits not being passed after inspection they would be subject to the expense of enlisting them. It appeared that the surgeons of the militia regiments were to be the sargeons who woald ras the recruits; and the Government were entitled to thanks for the concession they had made in this respect Doring the late war, it was intimated to the surgeons, both of the militia and the line, that they ought not to be as strict in their examination of recruits as they were in time of peace; but as those officers were to bs made responsible for the cost, shouldthe recruits berejected, they oug t to have definite instructions as to whether the ordeal preliminary to the passing of the men should or -hould not be a stringent one. He had again to express his hope that during the recess Her Majesty's Government 'would take into consideration the claims of a body of officere to whose case he had recently called their atten ion. He referred to the heutenant-colonels of the army on whom the warrant of October, 1854, had had a retrospective operation. To show the working of this principle the hon. and -31 -1 'il- i,.U. oc0 o a Colonel who entered the army in 1807, becarme lioutenant-colonel after he had been 49 years in the service, was employed in the Peninsula, and was never absent during the camipaigns of 1810, 1811 1812 18135 and 1814. The officer in question was LieutenZut-Colorel Alvee, now Major-General qves, on the retired list, who was passd over by 53 jtuiors, owing to the retrospective aetion of the warrant of 6th October, a I. He enitered the armay November 5, 1807; was Promoted to be colonel on the 9th of November, 1856 ; and on the 5th of December, 1856, took the retired full-pay, with step of rnk. His services were :-General Aations.-Baswao Fuentes D'Onor, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajos, Salamanca, Vittoria, Pjrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, Tulouse. Actions. - Retreat to and occupation of Lines of Torres Vedra-, Pombol, Redinha, Foz d'Arouce, Guards, Sabugal, El B1 don, Aldea de Ponte, Capture of Madrid and Retiro, Affairs on retreat from Madrid to Portugal, Passage of the Ebro, Blockade of Pampelna, Vie Bigorre, and Tarbes. Yet, by the warrant of October, 1854, this distinguished soldier, who bad retired when he became a full colonel, wAs passed over by no fewer than 53 other ofEicers, many of whom had joined the army long after the close of the French wlar. There remained on the same list a groat number of other officers who had gained their promotion for disti,guished gallantry. Before this warrant came into play nobody could pass over the head of a liectenantucolonel bta a Queen's aide-de-camp; and, relying on this rule, many officers had gone upon half-pay. He had brought this subject under the notice of the House in the month of June, when he obtained an assurance that it would receive the attention of the nobt, lord at the heed of the War Department. Since theo, however, he regretted to say that as many as 25 men had beeFu ptomoted over the head of the senior colonel on this list. No greater pay was given to a colonel than to a lieutenant. colonel- and a brevet might easily have been issued by which tiese officers would have been spared the mortification of seeing young men who were subalterns when they them. Eelves were lieutenant-colonels preferred over them merely because they had been in commaud of regiments for two years and nine months. Hle therefore trusted that the noble lord at the hoad of tbe Government, who, he was sure, was always disposed to reward the services of the officers of the army in a fitting manner, would take steps in the course of the ensuing reoess to remedy so grievous a hardship. Sir F. BS!ITH congratulated the noble lord at the head of the Government on the introduction of the present measure. No sounder arrangement could be made than to embody a portion of the militia. He believed that the racruiting of the regular army would, at the same time, be carred on with great success. During tha late war 40 000 men were enlisted ia the regiments of the line, and we then had as many as go0 different racruiting detachments. When the mutiny broke out in India we had only 26 such detachments, but since that time the number sad been rapidly increased, and now amounted teXuween 300 and 400. Within thelast fortnight we hbA obtained upwards of 1,000 recruits, although the Ciroumstances were unfavonrable for procurin thon. When the harvest was completed we should no doubt get a great many more, under the auspices of the distinguished ofricer who presided over our recruiting operations. Tee Government had desptched to India an augmentation ofthe troops of the line, and also of the cavalry. They were likewise, for the first timo,-it beig an exception to the ordinary rule-sending out a force of the Royal Artillery There were 3,000 Sappers and Miner" attached to our arm and be was quite certain- that 1,000 maight be spared for Iadis. He might be told that the East India Company had a suffoient numuber of engineers in India, but he believed that that was not the faot. He had reason -to know that there was a great demand for engineers in India. Of course, if Delhi had fallen-and he hoped it had-there would not be so great a necessity for their services; but every military man, and no man better then the noble viscount at the head of the Government. knew that there were but four ways by which Delbhi ould be reduced-fint by capitulation, !hic was hIghy ImProbable, and which would be Au_psiei ro ush toacp,h h trswa h Imposlti foi' us to ac-cept, be the te.rm`s wAa-t they might ,next, by investing it, and reducing the mutt- neers y famine, which would be a long operation, and one that would not keep up the prestige of the British army in India; thIrdly, by ault xndfourthly by esoalade. The last named phn-ths of escalade-vwoul not be very easy for us to accomplish, owing to the resent position of our army in India. It would seem, then, that the most advisable means of reducing Delhi was that of making a breach, with a view to its capture. Of course it was very well known that the whole of the Sappers and Miners belonging to the East India Company's eervice had deserted with the rest of the rebels, and were nowin Delhi. Everynilitary man knew that the sorties at Delhi bad been conducted with considerable skill. One of our lanks had been attacked,sd another flank turned, and if that flank had not been composed of British holdiers the rmen belonging to it would have been doubled up: and utterly destroyeod. He should not be at all surprised if the mutineers now in Delhi made it a30ther Saragossa. General Barnard had not, so far as he knew, a sngle soldier who was able to do the work of a sapper and ininer. He therefore hoped ihat Her Majesty's Government would send outlarge hod of mer thoroughly qualified to do thatkind of -wor, Pesaps le might ie told.that l European sapper could'aoftiork intbe hot climate of India! butledidnotbelieveanythingof-tykind.

If without the slightest expectation 24 hours beforehand an insurrection can take place extending over a country nearly as large as Europe, and with a population of 180,O0C,000 ot souls-if suoh a thing could happen without those wbo are responsible for the administration of that country having the slightest previousknowledge or suspicion f it-n want to know of what use or value is the AdminDis. iratiou-andercircumstances of tbat kind. Every day some1hing oozes out vhich sbows tbat the Administration vf India ,ught to have been, if not atsolutely prepared for all that has occurred, imost suspicious and prescient of what has happened. You cannot justify now, when you are mora acquainted with tho circumstances-you cannot, with your knowledge of the insubordination of the Bengal army, justify that Admninistration in permitting a post like Defli, the arsenal of the Bmpire, to be garrisoned solely by native troops, vwen they must have had information of the mystical symbols of combination and conspiracy circulating in that very city at the commencement of this year. These are questions not very convenient now to urge, hut whea attacks are made on members of Parliament because they performed their duty, after the conclusion of the war, in enforcing economy and retrenchment on Ministers, and when it is said that the fault of our present position is due to members of Parliament doing their duty, it is right for us in our defence to make these emarks, and to impress on the country other considerations 1esides those which were submitted by the hon. and tallant GeneraL I repeat, we did our duty in enforeing (concmy on the Government, though it is very much to be segretted, considering what has happened, thab we were t ecessful in our policy. I doubt not that the Government of this country acted fairly and candidly by the House in censenting to that great reduction of taxation and to those general measures of economy which were adopted. They did believe, no doubt, that they had provided sufaciently for all the exigencies of the country, but the Ministers cannot relieve themselves front this grave responsibility which devolves on them, for having, in consequence of their fatal ignorance of the condition of a great portion of Her Majesty's mpire, and of their total negligence and inadvertence, sanctioned the policy, which Parliament commenced, of recuction, at a time when it is quite clearthat if they had ken in possession of that information which I maintain they ought to have been in possession of musthave appeared a moSt vunwise policy, and which has proved most injurious to this country. (Hear, hear.) Mr. V. SMITHL-The present debate began by the hon. and gaUant General and by another hon. member offering some useful suggestions on the question how the revolt in India naiglxt be put an end to in a tone for which the Goverament could not be otherwise than grateful; and the right hon. gentleman, when he began, assumed the same tone, and, as I understood, deprecated the discuesion at the present time of the causes of the Indian mutinies. A-t the cloec ef his speech, however, the right hen. gentleman forgot his opening warning, and feU into that line of observations 'n which he had on a former occasion indulged, The right hon. gentleman referredto the speech of the hon. and gallant member for Calne, whom he represented as saying that the Government, being perfectly aware of the great need of troops, had cut down the force from fear of the House of Commons. lfow, I understood the hon. and gallant gentleman to say no such thing; but, at aP events, I am sure the Government had no intention so to act. My noble friend has stated what I believe to be a perfectly acknow. ledged constitutional doctrine, which the right hon. member forBackinghamshire has himself adopted-namely, that, though it is the duty of the House of Commons to enforce economy on the Ministers, yet, if the Minisers are &ware that the state of affairs in Europe or in any of Her Mfajesty's dominions makes it fatal to diminish the military forces, they are bound to defy-if I may use that expression-even the House of Commons, and to force on the House those considerations whichappear to them important. The Ministers, however, were aware of no such oonsiderations. They proposed a peace establishment v6hich they are still disposed to think was a sufficient peace establishment, and wbich happened to be above the peace fstablishment existing before the commencement of the war. But the right hon. gentleman says that the Governmaent ought to have been aware of this affairin India. Now, if the righthon. gentleman enters into that argument, and states hile reasons wby he thinks so, I hope I shall be prepared to n-eet him ; but on the present occasion he had only adverted to one circumstance in connexion 'with that point, and that is that Delhi, being a large arsenal, had I-een left unprotected by European troops. Now, if the Government in 1857 could have been aware of any danger existing in that circumstance, every Government for the last 20 or 30 years ought to have been equally cognizant of it; but they never were, and I deny that there existed. any particular circumstances attracting the attention ( f Government to the unprotected state of Delhi. It w;as always believed throughout India that Delhi was an unsafe and unhealthy station for Europeon troops, and Sir C. Napier, whoge opinions on Indian affairs were much referred to, desired a large arsenal there, to be protected by 12 native regiments, and never proposed to place European troops at that station. This may be a question of policy, but neit31er the present not preceding Governnents should be blamed -with reference to this point. iThe right hon. gentleman has defended himself fr)ni a,up- posed attack for having enforcedeconomy. ThieiGovernment donotmake ariychargeagaasthimupon that ground. They think it is the duty of a member of the House of Commons to consider economy in all these matters, and when we are told that the (Government diminished the forces too much I refer in reply to the statement of my noble friend, who pointed out that, though the House might tell the Goverment that it would vote a larger number of troops, 3 et the House was not ready to tell him that it would vote larger ways and means to maintain them. oll. members surely cannot have forgotten the war 9d. The co-entry called out to the Government to get rid of that war 9d., and I think that that cry was perfectly fair at the time, after the termination of all the calamities which had occurred, and there being no circumatances in Europe (r in any of Her Majesty's possessions which indicated any ause of alarm rendering it necesEary to keep up that tas. If, therefore, any Minister had come down to the Houge under those Circumstances, and stated that he vou3d r ot take off the war 9d., because the arsenal of Lelbi was un,rotected by European troops, such a.lea would have been scouted by the House of Commons, and he would have been accused of putting it forward merely for tbe purpose of keepingup large establisments, It would have been Eaid this was a plain impoeition on the part of the Go'. rnnwent, for noouthreaktherecould possibly beanticipated. The right bon. gentleman referred to a statement made by my noble friend the member for the city of London, who fxpressed his surprise-at which lda not wonder-that, COnsidering cil thein.ventionsof modern science, wehould have no better means of de"pbtching troops to India than by sail. irg sessels. The assumption, however, is not quite accurate, for great care was taken in the consideration of tbhi queEtion, and a number of troops were sent ont in screw steamers, the others being sent in clippers and sailing vessels. But the sight bon. gentleman forgets that there werc many advantages in sending out the troops by good clippers. They were not only more economical-which I admit IS not itself a sufflcient consideration-but regard being bad to the Feastn of the year the passage is as likely to be made by tbhm in 70 da)s as by the Ecrew steamers themselves, L% ery consideration was given to the matter with the view of expediting the transport of troops to India, and considerirg the season of the year and otber circulmstances the clippers were thought to be rather better. than steamers. With regard to the question whether the troops ought to have been sent through Egypt the House mrust loolk at all the circumstances. If wve had had steamers in the Red Sea to c nvey the troops from Suez to India, that would ha-ve leen the more expeditious mode of transit, and we might have overcome the political difficulties attendant upon the I a sage of troops through a foreign country. But we had no such steamers ready, and if we had communicated with the Indian Government, desiring that they should be sentk or if we had sent ibem ourselves we should have lost as much time as in sending the troops by the usual route. There was another reason in the unhealthiness of the PRed Sea at that ceseen of the year, which rendered it undesirable to send troops by this route. We could not by any dcgree of foresight have been provided with ships at Suer, nor, if v,e hbad sent out screw steamers, wouldctthere have ete n a sufficient provision of coal at the usual coaling ,talions, since the coal provided forthosesteamers which usually run would have been entirely insufficient for the Iarge system of transport rendered necessry by the recent eccurrences. There has, therefore, been no neglect of the nodern inventions of science, nor any of that dulness, ignorance, or prejudice which might be presumed. All tbat can be said is that, under the circumstances, -we have not been able to deal with the modern inventions of science so amply as wve might otherwvise have done. Then the right boa, gentlemPan says that troops ought to have been sent to India from the Cape. I can assre hintv that the Govern. ment lost no tinme in sending the meat positive instructions to Sir G. Grey at the C,ape to forward two regiments immediately to India. It has been left ia Ri'. a. Grey's disre-tion to send more thanr two me , orI not, but be is instructed to send sr many more 8s-be can Bpare. I do not think that more distinat instructions could 1i ve been sent to the Governor of the Cape. At the tame time it bappeas by a curious coincidence that Lord liphir.- stone, the Governor of Bombay, with an energy and discre. tie n tba* cannot be too hl&hly applauded, sent for two rements from the Cape, Valso despatched vessels whereby tl ey might be forwarded to Bombay without delay. (Hear, hear.) Ido noi think, therefore, that the Government can he justly cbarged with any want of energy and foresight in rescset to the Cape, But the right hon. gentleman has tbrown ont a charge and has led us by impllcation to suppose that Governor Sir G. Grey ia not likely to act on these instructions, or to send as many troops from the colony Ps he can spare. I have tbe bonour of Governor Grey's aoquaiLtance, and I do not believe there is any oanmoerezady to act on his own responsibility. Sir G. Grey is not Only a iran of judgment, but of undoubted nerve and hiah corgea. Be is not likely to be alarmed at the position of affairs in the colony, and there is no doubt that it he can spaP more an two regiments he will send them to India. Governor Grey in all the ff(ces he hats filled bhs executed his duties to tbo satisfaction of his supneriors and the public. I hap. penrd to be attacbed to the (olonial-ofiice when he was tfrst appointed to a colonial government by my soble friend the mrmber for the city of London. That appointment was liven to him from a knowledge of the energy and skill he l ad displayed in his journeys in Wetein uSltali. 'A tbat time Governor Grey was nuknown to my noble friend (Lord J. Russell), but every Colonial Secresary retained him in some colonil government until he was appointed Gover. or of the Cape of Good Hope, in which post he has acted with courage, spirit, and judgment. (Hear, bear.) My hon. acd gallant friend the member for Westminster has referred to the native Princes of India, and he sys that we onght to manifest our satisfaction with their sesvices and fidelity y giving them an increase of territory. Well, that may come hereafter, but it is at present donbtful whether it would be expedient to exhibit in that manner our acknow- hdgnreset ef their con4ugt~ Wa~ q b.£ the untive priace4 a pnrtion of oar S3ppers and Minerg, who, he wu tiafied, wuuld well discharge their daty. Sir D. L. EVANS concurred in the suggestion of the hon. and gallant gentleman as to the eending out of flappeors and Miners to India. Even if Delhi were taken before the Sappers and Miners arrived there, they might be most sefaUy employed in the construction of a series of fortified positions. Europeans might not be able to work so rapidly in India as the natives of Indic, but their work, he was sure, would be more solid and finished thaa that done by natives. They were now on the subject of the militia, which was intimately connected with the wvhole of the Indian question, because the militia -was to be embodied for the 'very purpose of meeting the state of things which the mutiny in India had occasioned. He was very very much astonished to find that the noble lord at the head of the War Department had stated that the number of miaitiamen proposed to be oaUled out for the present was 10,000. That number appeared to him to be totally and absurdly inadequate. He recollected that complaints were made by naval officers almost on the eve of the declaration of war against Rusda of the insafficient number of sailor; in the Royal navy, but not a saUor was added to it, and the Government attempted to justify their supineness by giving this very wise reason-that tho increase of our navy at that time might affect the negotiations then being oarried on with the Emperor of Russia. (aear, hear.) He reaDy thought that the addition of merely 2,000 men to oar navy was not much wiser conduct than that of the Government immediately previoas to the war with Rassia. He begged to suggest to the Government that there was a great want of smaU steamers to carry on our operations against the mutineers in India. We had several such vessels, if not rotting, at least lying idle, which might be turned to exceL lent account if they were sent to take part in the operations in India. By their means our men could penetrate far into the interior of India, and a moral as well as a physical effect would thereby be produced upon the people of India. He hoped that the Government would employ some of our large ships of war in conveying troops to India. The French set us the example of tus employing ships of war during the campaign in the Crimea. The French navy did net entertain that prejudice which it was said our naval officers entertained against the employment of war vessels as transports during a time of war. Even if a little irregularity should be occasioned in the discipline of our navy by employing our war ships as transports, he thought that any objection which our naval officers might have of that nature ought to yield to a desire to promote the public good in a time of emergency. He did hope the Government would re-consider this snbject, and would, if possible, employ the great and powerful steamers belonging to Her Majesty for service in India. Every exertion ought to be made on this occasion. The conflicts which had taken place before Delhi and in other places were, he found, of a vigorous description, and it was gratifying to see the heroic valour displayed by our soldiers of every class in the face of vastly superior numbers. On this point he would remind the noble lord that a year or two ago Her Majesty determined to grant what was styled the Victoria Cross for acts of specialvalour. In future that reward was to be given on the field by the general comrmanding, and this was a most desirable mode of distribution. He should recommend forthe consideration of the noble lord whethar authority might not be given to Sir Colin Campbell to confer this Victoria Cross as a reward for the gallant acts of our Indian troops lately recorded. He thought also that on such an emergency as this the Government should consider the propriety of removing the ground of complaint which was made more than once by the DaLke of Wellington in his despatches,-namely, that he had not the power of giving the smallest promotion. It would be weeU to give the commander-in-chief in India the power not only to fill up vacancies, but to grant promotion, subject, of course, to the confirmation of the Sovereign and the Govermnent. He savw by the publio journals that the force in the Persian Galf had been ordered back to India. The statement was, he hoped, correct. General Jacob, who was in command of that force, wa a man of great experience, of great scientific attainments, and of undoube aility; and no man in the Indian army stood higher in the service, Independently, therefore, of the great advantage which would be gained from his presence in Scide, where he was so well known, it was to be hoped that his services would be made available in some command. The mention of this officer's name, by the by, reminded him of the statement that these mutinies had taken the Indian Government by surprise. There must, however, have been some infatuaton on the parb of the Government on this point, for the whole state of things had been laid bare seven years ago in a amphlet of a very ctriking character published by General=acob. The statements also made by Sir Charles Napier and other officers on the same subject ought surely to have induced the Government to take steps to avert the dangers pointed out. Upon the question of caste, which had so much to do in this matter, he saw it reported in the newspapers that the commander of the forces in Bombay bad lately issued an order of a character quite new in that Presidency-namely, that recruits only of high caste should in future be raised for the Bombay army. He hoped that the right hon. gentleman (Mx. V. Smith) could state that this was not the case, or otherwise it would afford a strong proof to his mind of the unfitness of the offlcer he alluded to for the high command held by him. Nothimg could be more obvious than the inconsistencyand the imprtdenceof attempting teengraft upon the Boabiay army a systam of oeeo whioeh hld lod apparently to such fatal results in the army of BengaL On another point connected with India he must express his satisfaction th the statement of the noble lord the other evening, that the Govermntent intended to give pecuniary aid for the establishment of the telegraph between Suez and Aden. It was true that this wou!d only apply to some few hundred miles of the route to India, but no doubt it would greatly facilitate and acoelerate the communication, and he trusted, therefore, the Government would see that the undertaking was carried out with despatch. With regard to what had been said on a former occasion as to the conveyance of troops through Egypt, he confessed that the statement of the nobMe lord respectin,%the difficulties by no means convinced him of the imprwcticailityofadoptingthisroute.Inhisopinon,apo. - tion OIthetroops might with great advantage besentthrough Egypt, and as the necessity for sending reinforcements would undoubtedly continue he hoped the Government would reconsiderthis subject. Other points conuected with the state of affairs in India had been touched in the discussions which had taken place, but to these he would not refer. Jle had neither the ability nor the disposition to enter into the question of policy raised the other evening by the right hon. gentleman opposite; but there were one or two matters relating to Indian policy which it would be well not to lose sight of. It appeared that some of the native princes, even among those residing close upon the scene of conflict, had remained perfectly loyal in the midst of the disturbances which had taken pLace, Among them were Holkar, Scindiah. and others; and he thought it would be well, vwithout waiting for ulterior events, that those princes should be told that their conduct would be rewarded hereafter by an extension of their territory orin some other way. At all events, some declaration of the intention of the Government to evince their satisfaction at and their gratitude for the course pursued by these princes ought not to be delayed, because it waa o! the utmost importance to us that they should remain steady to our alliance. Then, again, he ventured to thinu the Government ought to make arrangements to finish this matter, certainly in the second campaign. By next November our troops ought to march with triumph through every part of the disturbed districts. As to the reinforcements he hoped these would rot be despatched by driblets, but that every exertion would be made, without reference to money, to place the largest possible amount of naval and military force at the ISpoa of the Indian Government. He had expressed his =atisfaction the other day that a large reinforcement of artillery-consisting, he believed, of 17 troops-was to be sent out. It appeared, however, that those troops were weak in number, and would only muste- 134 gunners each. Now, the strength of the troops of artillery in the Crimea was eventually 204 men. In the present case no marain was left for losses by sickness or other causes, andbhe should not be surprised if it were shortly found necessary tb form two of these troops into one. It was most essential for the Government to bear in mind that from varioii causes heavy losses must be looked for in the force despatched to India, and adequate provision must be made to supply these losses. Sir W. F. WILLIAMS quito concurred in the remarks made by the hon. and gaUant member for Chatham (Sir F. Smith) upon the necessity of sending out Sapper, and Miners to India. When they remembered the number oi strong places which were now in the hands of the rebeLq, hon. gentlemen might well imagine the efforts which must be made before they could be dislodged by troops of this description. In his opinion, It would be necessary to send out 1,000 of this admirable corps with their officers as soon sa possible. He concurred aso in the remarks of the hon. and gallant general (Sir Do Lacy Evans) as to the strength of the troops and companies of artillery which were to be despatched. Those troops were about to embark for a c9untry the climate of which in some districts was of a most deadly charaoter, and' therefore not only ought they to leave England in as.efficient a state as possible, but every calculation should be made for the casualties which might be anticipated in their ranks. gedidnot concur in the hope expressed by the gall'ant general that if Delhi wero wxen not one stone should ba left upon another. (Hear, hear.) It contained arsenals and woiks which haa been prepared with great care and at gteat expense; it containod, aso, a large amount of stores and ammunition, and a more serious mistake had not been made of late years thai leaving such a place, full of such ntat,ye'r, hi the charge of black troop,. (EHear, hear.) Instead oa Delhi bein' destroyed, and not one stone being left upon another, he hoped that it might be preserved with very geat care, and that, if we once got possession of It again, we should never allow an enemy to be seen within its walls. e agreed in all that had been said with respect to the want at foNeifed places in India. He had been in all the presidencies of that country, and he had seen, so to speak, the naked. nese of theland-station afterstation vwithout a single strong. hbld. The consequence Ws that when we were attacked li Went-over like a pack of cards He hoped that Parliament would turn their attention"to thisubjectand that we should nDver agSin permit so great a calamity-he might say dis. ,tace-to fall upon the nation.

[An bon. Member on the Opposition aide.-" Wehaverneverdone otberwke."] With regard to tbo Sappers and Miners going to Ind*, he remembered that when Aldershott was being discussed in that Houso he stated that he "as in favour of Aldershott on condition, inter afia, that the troops of the line should be instructed in a certain amoutst of sapplng and mining, in making gabions, and in other things that might he useful when they wont to India. He only hoped that tbey had been so mstructed, and that the authorities at Aldershott had taken those step3. If they had not, they might probably hear opinions expressed when they came to discuss these subjects next year which would not be agreeable. Sir E. VERNEY was satisfied that whatever exertions Her Majesty's Government might think fit to mnake to meet the present crisis in India, to render our troops victorious, and to restore that government and dominion which we had so long enjoyed there, would meet with the cordial co-operation of the House and of the country. (Hear.) He could not entirely conear with his gallant friend Iho had last spoken in saying that the Governmetvtwere not to blame for cutting down our establishments, because he did not believe that they would listen to representations made on either side of the House unless they conceived that those representations were founded on justice and truth, and he contended that it was upon their responsibility and that of no one else that the reductions had taken place. He thought, however, that they should now inquire, not so much who was to blame for the frightful calamity thathad taken place, as what measures could be adopted to remedy the present state of things and as soon as possible to give protection to oar countrymen in India. He desired to see, for example, not only large steamers employed upon the large rivers, but small steamers sent up all the small rivers where our stations mostly were established. Such steamers going up, well armed and wel manned, would afford the greatestpos. sible protection to those stations. He knew well the frightful c=aamities to which our countrymen we"e exposed, and he trusted, therefore, that there would be nothinglikevacillation or want of strength, determination, or vigour exhibited on the part of the Government or of the authorities in India. (Hear, hear.) He was quite sure that when the details of this Indian warfare should be told we should find that there had been performed acts of heroic valour and of wonderful fortitude on the part both of soldiers and civilians which would fiU us with admiration and with national pride. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, ho trusted that the gallant army which was about to proceed to India would be provided w,ith adequate medical assitance and with every comfort and necessary that could he required. (Hear, hear.) Sir J. R&MSDEN, in answer to the various questions which had been addressed to him, said, that the principle on which the Government had acted with respect to calling out the militia was. that the number which they proposed to embody should bear some proportion to the number of troops sent from this country to serve in India. At present, according to the number sent out, the Government considered that it would be sufficient to embody 10,000 militia to do the garrison duty which the troops that kad gone to India would otherwise have done. If it should afterwards be found necessary to despatch a larger number of troops to India, then it would be requisite to draw more largely on the militia; but in the meantime 10,000 would he enough for the purpose. He had received no intimation with re. spect to the insufficiency of the information which had been gMen to the surgeons the he militia to guide them in the conduct of the reCruiting service, but if any of those gentlemen thought it desirable that the directions should be more precse they would receive every information upon application at the War-office. It was impossible at present to state precisely which militia regiments it was intended to embody. He was fully aware that it must be a matter of great inconvenience to militia offioers to be kept in doubt longer thn was necesry, and as soon therefore as it would be possible to let them know, eonsistently with the public interests, they should be informed. In selectng the regiments the Government would be regulated by the reports whbich they received as to the ability of the various regiments to do the most efficent service immediastely on being called out. Admiral WALCOTT suggested that Admiral Seymour should receive orders to despatch all the smal steamers and gunboats which ha had at Hongkong to India. They would oe of immense use in India, while, as to the Chinese, we comld take them in hand at any time, and thrash them at our leisure. ('<Hear," and a laugh) He took this opportunity of expressing the high opinion which he entertained of the gallantry and judgment which had been exhibited by Admiral Seymour and by the officers, both of the navy and marnes, unDder his eemmand, who had been eng,agod in the operations in the Chinese waters. I-ord PALIERSTON.-41y hon. friend the UnderSecretary of State for War has explained generally the points of detail which have been referred to in the course of this debate. I can only repeat what he has said, that in fixing the number of the militia which we in the first instance think it expedlent to embodygwe by no means bind ourselves not to call out more if circunstances should render It expedient to do so. However, recruiting has gone on with great success In spito of the harvest, and we entertain no doubt that when the operations incident to this period of the year are completed the number enroUed wil very rapidly inerease, and we shall1 within a very limited period be able to place in tho ranks a numbar of men equal to that which has been sent to India. My hon. and gallant friend the meember for Westminster repeatod to-night ayery natural suggestion which was mado on a previous evening, that these troops should be sent to India in screw line-of-battle ships, which could easilybo adapted to that pu,rpose, which could be navigated by a small crew, and would carry a large number of men with convenience and despatch. In the first instance such an arrangement may appear to be very advantageous, but I vould request the House to bear in mind other considerations in regard to the amount of our military force at home which have been very forcibly dwelt upon. We were reminded that we had been compelled to despatch to distant stations a large portion of the military force for which we ased, and which Parliament granted, for the general purposes of the country in time of peace, and it was said, "By so doing you have greatly weakened your defensive means at home, and foreign countries may take advantage of your apparent weakness, and either hold language which you ought not to bear or do things to which you ought not to submit." The answer which I gave to that was that the people of this country would not endare conduct of that sort, and that if an emergency should require it men would be raised rapidly and upon the sudden. That very consideration, however. shows how inexpedient it would be to send to the other end of the word the greater portion of our naval foroe (hear, hear)'; because, although these steam line-of-battle ships are, it is true, lying in ordinary and of no immediate use, yet if any of these events should occur ,Ke shoiad want suddenly to put to sea a large fleet, and how could we do that if the ships which we should require were doing duty as transports in the Indian Seas ! Therefore I think that prudence shows that the despatch of these ships to the East would have been a very inoexpedieat course,-in fact, It would have been falUng into the error which the great orator of Greece imputed to the Persians. He said,- " When you Btrike a blow at one part of them they put their hand to that part and leave exposed every other, which way be struck in turn. Do not, you Athenians, follow 6so unwise and foolish an example." I think that we should have fallen into an error of the same kind if we had sent to India the fleet which circumstances occurring in Europe might, at short notioe, render necessary for our defence at home. (Hear, hear.) The suggestion of the hon. and gallant officer as to the sending of troops across Egypt is well worthy of consideration. On a yrevious occasion I stated the objections to suoh a pro ceeding. These objections it may be possible to overcome, especially if you can make Arrangements beforehand. If a smaUlforcewere requixed speedily atv a particular station arrangements might be made for sending It across from Alexandria to Suez. With regard to the general question, I think that the House ought to take a larger view than bon. members have generally been disposed to adopt. We bave been reproached for precipitately reducing our army and navy upon the return of peaco. Some have said that in doing so we yielded to pressure from particular members of this House, while others have attributed it to a want of foresight on our part. The course which we have adopted is the only one which any Government acting- under a representative system 'such as ours will evebe able to prsure. (Heas, hear.) Differeat forms of Government have thir different advantages. Undoubtedly a despotic Governmaent is the best for providing in time of peace the means and preparations for war, be- cause such a Goveranmet, being subject to no control bat Its own will, and possessing the foresight which you must assume all governors of countries to have, keep up in tune of peace a larger force than is actually required for defence, and when war unfortunately occurs it is atonce ready to meet the pressure which is thereby occasioned. On the other hand, when war does break out then comes the advantage of representative institutions, because then it is that the whol, nation rallying round the Goverment gives to it a support and a forc which no despotic Government can by any means or by any possibility possess, In time of Pesce, however, a represeatative Government is com. paratively weak. It is iot that if we were to press this House we might not persuade it to vote men in Committee of Sapply. We might induce it [to give us a larger peac establishment both of army and navy, bat your votes of Supply are 9q no use whatever unless they-are accompanied by votes4in Waya and .eans. (Hear, hear.) That is the limit of yopg pena.ac establishment. (Hear, hea.) What happens when pepcd arrives ? What took place last year ?

That ws the rW, season of the reduction of our miitary andti nvl eataih_ maents to an amount lower than would bave been *xpedient at the present moment. Still, with all the inoonvenimouo which these changes of opinion and of system may produoe, there are inherent in a representative amsembly so many id vantages 'that these should be regarded' only aedcfeotat which the coauntry must at all timex be ready-to ... pair by prompt and speedy measres; and I am .;dw sure that those exertions will never be wanting worm.. x the occasion may reqaire them. The present ease, hoirw . ever, is not one of so much diffioulty as was presented xol the breaking out of the Russian war, because wvhen thchwar began aU the sadition to our military was to be muade at the expense of the coantry. The expense of any addl.-' silons made now falls, not upon the revenues of the empue, but upon those of the East India C(ompany. Thereore, ne. additional expenditure is required on the part of the nation, and all that we have to do is, as troops are from time to.. time withdrawvn for action abroad, to keep up our establish_ ments at the numbers voted by the Committee of Supply. That I think we shall be able to do; but this House has already unanimouely voted an address to the Crown*assuring Her Majesty that nothing shall be wanting on. our part to enable her to carry on operations in India.. with vigour and saucess; and if betweon this &u&. the period at which Parliament usually meets it shodl be neceseary to ask for further assistance, I am quip.. sure that no members of this House would grudge th3 attendanoe which might be neoesesary to afford thetad.*~ ance to the Government. (Cheers.) My hon. and gallais friend thinks that a large naval force ought to be anttko. India, as a flotilla which shoald eperate in the rivers. The House must, however, recollect what Iam sare my hon. ac&gallant friend from his experience knows very well, tba% the Indas and the Ganges, although they figure very welL upon a map, and are really very large streams, are not gin.- rally of such a depth as to be navigable by ships vlieoh vu could send from home. Their navigation is impeded byr sandbanks, shoals, rocks, and shallows, and tny ships which we could send from this countrry would be perfectly usless except jest at theirmouths. My right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admjralty has sent or is sending out such a flotilla as it Is pos. bible to despatch from England, but it must be remembererN that the East India Company have a navy of their own. All their ships were employed in the Persian exped]tion, bib,h the greater portion of them must by this time have zetarneds to India, and therefore their crews can be placed lm theieshallow boats or raft;, which alone are usefulfor the navi. gation of the rivers of India, and by which any operations in those rivers can best be performed. Withb respect to Persia, the engagements embodied In he..- recent treaty have not yet been fulfilled. Herat has roty jo. been evacuated. On the contrary, there are reports whioch. affirm that additional troops have been ent by Perdsa4 Herat. That has beendenied by the Persin Ambassador at Paris; but still the -whole of the engagements of the trats havenotbeencarried ihto effect; great doubts an enterkino1 as to the good faith of the Persian Government; and therefore, until the stipulations of the treaty have been cospliez1 with, ita Is perfectly clear that the British force cannot and will not be withdrawn. That force is under the coin. mand of General Jacob, a most distinguihed genert officer, and until that force has been withdrawn fi will be necessary to have there an officer of the greals military experience which General Jacob posesses. Welf,l then, I say we are thankful for the suggestions which havsa been made this evening, coming as they do from persons. who are so well competent to make them, and I can assure. those who have oflered them and the House that theyp shall receive every attention fron Her Majesty's Govern. ment, who will take advaatage of any of those suggestionsr that they mny think likely to conduoe to the effoicicy of the public service. But I entreat the House to believe tsat the.- attentions of Her Majesty's Government shall be most carefully and anxiously directed day by day to these sad erente. We feel not only how affiicting are the details which resab. us from time to time, bat also the vast importance of the, cobfliot now going on. We have no doubt, however, of oun ultimate euccess. We are confident that the strength and, power of this country will be put forth to suppress this, insurrection, let the causes of it be what they may, wbether they be religious or political, or from whatever source tles may have sprung. (Cheers.) I shall not enter into thow causes now; but I can assure the House that we feel the ful importance of maintaining the Indiau empire of this country, that no exertions towrards that end shall be want. ing on our part, and I have tho most perfect oonfidence thab. those exertions will be attended with complete sacces. (Cheers.) Mr. DISRAELI (who spoke in so unusually low a tono. of voice as to render it a matter of difficulty to eoUeet theFwhole of his observations), was understood to .say,-I onlt wish our home defences were at this moment not inferiorto. what they were during the late war, for we had then our Artillery, our Marines, andour Channelfleet. Bat now ont Artillery has gone to India, our Marines ae in Chins, ani. our Channel fleet-(the remainder of the sentence WAs inaudible). We must remember, with respect to the observaations of the gallant general as to the trausmission of tropsos by ships of war of the * highet Class, that, according to tbEi reports we have, there are ships of that character quite. sfficient to make an efficient defeno of our own country, and to set in the manner which the gallant gencralf suggested, whhUe we might at the suame time have the great advantage of a Channel fleet. But I tbinXk everybody mnst admit that in an emergency of thizskind, after all we have heard of scientific progress during tbe last few years, and of the application of science to tboe purposes of war, and after all we have heard of screw pro. pellers and overland routes to India, it is extremely. nortifying to find that we cannot have recourse to Any o¢ those new sources of strength. (Hear.) I think that is verp much to be regretted ; and, although we may not be. Ablhet to send 30,000 or 40,000 mren over Egypt, yetm. there can be no donbt that 5,000 men, if they had been aenm through Egypt, would have been a most valuable additia to the force which we have inIdia, and, arriving there veyy shortly after the troops we had sent to China, there woul& have been a force of 10,000 men. which would have had a; very oonsiderable effect on the fortunes of the war. I amvery glad to hear that this militia force is caled into action tc. supply the place ot our regular garisons. Ithinkitisvery.. much to be regretted that it has become prevalent oS late to look on the nilitia merely as a aneas or' recruiting the line. The highest character of tho. militia, that they are the constitutional defenders of eue_' country, ought never to be lost sight of. During ths late war it was to be regretted thatatt no time ws ther a,. militia regiment that was not pestered by a parcel of recruiting agents, and that the tone and ebaacter of ut militia regiments in the service was lessened auddegra4d, All this might have been Avoided, ansdgreater support. given to the regular army if there had been a noarerzrlatiowbetween the militia regiments and the line. IntheolA revolutionary war there were certain relations between-the, miltia regime4ts and the regiments of the line irhich acted rqclprocallyand mostbeneficially on each other. Theregi.. meuts of the line were recruited from the militia, aad the. tone andcharacter of the militia regiments were much high4 r - during the revolutionary wAr than during the warit.- Rusia Completo militia regiments at tbAt tfmeD *re.- efflisted for active servioe, and I beieve there ws then m.-I MtaterandLrmoreowntinuoussupplyofmen,altbougIthoseathr of enlistment which were practised during the late,war wu_e. n6t hadrecourse to. However, the militia is to be.em..i bqdied, and that is a very wise mnd proper mesllte.

The hon. and gaklant ger tleman haa referred to Bolker. nhat chief has, no dou,t, 11aiLtained hia Allegiance and behaved with sincerity to th.9 Government of India, but it also happens that Holkars tit opa havo all turned against us -'and it would, therefore, 1,e rather preu,ature to give him an inarease of territory. [SrDL. Evies- "These troops havo been put upon, im."] They are suppesed to be under bim, and in such a ste of things it would be premature to give increased territory to any chiefs who have exhibited their goodwill in so unsupported a manner. Many of the suggestions of my bon. and gallant friend will be valuable as objects of fnuture policy. The hon. and ga)lantgentleman the member for Chatbam (Sir F. Smuith) recommends us to send out sap. tersand miners. That suggestion comingfromsoexperieneod an autbority,nodloubt deserves, and will receive dueattention The nighthon. gentleman has suggested that steps ongbt to be talken for the relief of Cawnpore. That is a question which it vwould be diffliult to entertain here; but I have no doubt ihat by this time Cawupore is relieved. I regard the renmsa1s of amy bon. and gallant fziend as suggestions rather than attacks upon Her Majesty's Government; but when my hon. and gallant friend says that he agrees with the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire in thiking that the Government ought to provide for a senond and third campaign (Sir D. L. Evans.-" A second campsig,"') I must state that the Government have provided a force vhich they consider sufficient, and which they are assaled by all the authorities upon Indian subjects will be amply sufficient to extingrish the flame of insurrection in India. We have sent out an officer of undoubted ability- Sir Colin Campbell-to take the command of the army in India. There is already in the command of that army Sir Patrick Grant also a gentleman of undoubted ability, and a eli acquainted with the Indian army. It would not be wise to predict the course which it may be necessary to pur sue hercafter. The Government will despatch a sufficient force to India, but before they send the large reinforeements Thich some persons think necessary it may appear that the distinguished officers to whom I have alluded may be of a different opinion. We shall be prepared to act on the silggestion of those officers who are most competent to ijiorm us, but.1 hope that the House and the country ,will feel assured that there has been no lack of consideration as to the amount of force necessary to put an end to the revolt. An amnple force has been sent out for this purpose, and our reinforcements wiUl arrive at the best season of the e ear. They 'will, I cannot doubt, display tbcse ilitary qualities wvhich lead to success, and althoogh I would not hold out hopes that might be falsified by the event, I 'will assure the Houso tbat this question has not been treated lightly by Her M. jest'as Government, but bas been regarded by them as one of the most serious events that has ever occured to this couitsyu (Hear, bear.) These difficulties will, however he surmounted, for I am certain we shall be backed by the He.use in every endeavour to overcome them. (Cheers.) And when Her Majesty's Government turn their minds to the reorganization of the Indian army, and to the question wbether it will not be their duty, by a large addition to the European force in that country, to keep down the appearance of insurrection on the part of the native regiments, they will at the same time consider by wbat means they can best secuire and advance the happiness, comfort, and wellbeing of the natives of India. (Cbheers) Mr. RENLEY said it would be out of place for him to offer an opinion on military affairs, but he felt bound ta take some notice of the speech of the hon. and gallant member ior Calne (Sir W. Williams.) He did not know whether the hon. and gallant gentleman intended to make an attack upon his friends on the Mlinisterial benches for providin insufficient means for putting down this revolt, but he did maie an attack upon the House of Commons for having put a pressure upon the Governmnent and for hav1ng cut dowvn the establishments too low, and he, for one, protested against any such conclusion. Whathad since taken place completely negatived such a coi. clus-on, unless, indeed, the hon. and gaUant gentleman (General Williams) was of opinlon that the Government ought to have foreseen the danger of this oxttbreak in India. The Government were now despatching between 20,000 and 30,Q00 men to the Eat, and yet they had not felt it necessary to caU out the militia-they had merely asked for the t over to call it out at some future period. Surely, when it lad furnished the means in time of peace of sending out a force of 20,000 or 30,000 men to the other end of the globe, the House of Comuons could not fairly be charged with having cut down the estabhlibments of the country too far. The sight hon. gentleman (lr. V. Smith) had confourided two things that were totaly distinct. Vhen asked why a Muropean force had not been stationed at Delbi, the ri'ht hon gentleman's answer wvas, that that could not be done o--naiztently with the remission of " the war ninepence." Nowv, whatever might have been the information possess d I y the Government as to the necessity for garrisoning the st at of the ancient Mogul empire, it was plain that the war ninepence could have had no possible connexion with the n atter, because they a?l knew, and the noble lord the Primne Minister had tbat very night assured them, that the cost of providing additional tegiments for India fell exclasively upon the Indian treasury. (Hear, hear.) He denied, then), that pressure had beeau put upon the Government by sny part of the ounse to compel tbem to reduce the military force of the oountry below the proper iini. Whetber the Government might have had reason to antici pate such an outbreak as had since occssrredin the East was qunite another questiona, into wlich he would not now enter. But whatever might be the re uiremcents of India, that House ought not to be reproached with having forced the Government to out down the military strength of the kingdom to a point incompatible with the national safety and honour. (Hear, hear.) Indeed, the noble lord-Ahe Birst Minister bad himself entirely exonerated the House of Commons from the charge which the hon. and gallmt gentleman had tholght fit to bring against it. GeneralWILLIAMS complained that what he hadasaid had been misapprehended by two right hon. gentlemen vho had addressed the House. He bad nmade no attaok upon the Rouse of Commons. He had merely stated his opinion, as a member of that asserably, that the reductions which had been effected were unfortanate and precipitate. And he had added, so great was the pressure from without, that if the Govetrnment had thought it neceseary to have a larger body of troops, they would not-froma the spirit of certain parties in the EHouse-have been able to obtain them. Sir D. L EVANS explained that what he had said in regard to Holkar was, that that chief had been personally faithful to us, and that he had proved his fidelity by sending his treasure from Indore, his owvn oapital, to our fort at Idhowv. He was quite awrare, howvever, that Bolkar's regiments had mutinied. Mr. DISRA.ELI also explained that the President of the Board of Control had attributed to him, in regard to a third campaign, the verv reverse of what he had reaUy stated. What he had said was that they should take care to finish their operations in the second campaign, so as to preclude the necessity of a third. Mr. SPOONER aniinadverted on the absence from the speeches of the First Minister and the President of the Board of Control of any recognition of our entire dependence, for the success of our measures to quell the revolb in India, upon the blessing of Divine Providence. The Bill was then read a third time and passed. DULWICH COLLEGE BILL. On the order for considering the Lords' reasons for disagreeing from several of the Commons' amendments, Mr. BAINES observed that to a great number of the amendments made in this Bil by that House the other House had acceded. One point on which there was con- siderable variance between the views of the two chambers Was as to the constitution of the governing l'ody of the college. Four of the metropolitan pari.hes, including Camberwvell and Southwark, were particularly interested in this question. When this Billcame down from 1he Hiouse of Lords the governing body which it prolosed to estabhl was to consist of four elected memberscne from each of the parishes above mentioned-and 11 Don imated members, to be chosen by the Court of Chancery, The measure had been referred to a select committee of tbe Lower Houee, when, after much cousideration, it was eesmed desirable to raise the number of elected governors from four to eight, so as to give two repsesentatives to each of the four parishes. It was quite clear that it was the intention of the founder tbat persons representing localythe fourparishesshould firm a part of the governing and managing body of the institution. The committee of the Houseof Commonsreccirmendedthatthere should be eight elective guardians instead of four, and that there should be eight non-elective suardians. There was a difference in the committee as to how these eight should be appointed;* at last they hit on a ilan 'which, he thought,vwas not the best thatecould be adopted-namely, that three of the eigbt should consist of fficial persons-the Presiden,t and the Vice-President of the Cr mmittee of Privy COUnC;I. on Education, and the Presidint of the 'oor Law Board. However ornamental their names might be, it was quite evident that you could never expect them to give a regular attendance as part of the governing body of the institutioll. His opinion was that the Lords' plan was a better oneran ely, tha a certain number should be apnointed by the Ucutrt of Chancery, which it 'was well knowwu took great pains in satisfying itself as to the fitness of parties proposed as thv, gosernors of charities. The Lords insisted on the amendment which they made in thie Bill with regard to the elective and non-elective gsuardians. He was atrously of opinion that it Was desirable to adhere to the opinfo of tie Select Commoittee of the House of Commons, and to the unTanimous decision of the Rouse of Commons, with regard to tbe eight elective gardias. (Hear, hear.) He tbought tbat by doing so tbey wonld only be giving a reasonable satisfactionv to the %our paihes Those pasbes had every season to believe that the docision of the House of Commons ,would be adhered to. (Hear.) What he should tberefore reepectfully submit to the House by and by was that they should affirm their decision that eight should be the number of the elective govrrnoes. The Cletrk at the table having, on the motiwa of Mr. BAaSs, read the Lords' amendment with regard to the gtverning bOdy of the institution, Mr. BAINES moved that the House do insist on the amendment which they bad made in the Bill to the effect that there should be eight electivo guardianus Mr. KNIGHT moved that tbe debate be adjourned. He heliaved that a worse scheme than that propoumded by the Carity Cemmisaioners for the government of this instita. iconcouldnetbsdevised, andthat thebargainwhichhthe om nissioness had made with the Fellows was as bad as it could poEsibly be. If the Bill were thrown out no such bad bernain could ever Pgain be made with tLo Fcllows. There hAd been a constans struggle for mLany years betirevn 1le officerx and tbe objectg of this charity. For n any yers the officers had bee: endeavouring to Mt iz the property left by the founder for the benefit of the I cor. The offlcers in thoeQ endeavouis had been very sUCo ceseful.

THE IrDIAX ARMY. TO TEE EDITOR OOFT a` TIMES. SBr,-There can be but one opinion, that when wo shall again bave conquered India its native army ma*j Be ontirely remodelled, and composed of very diffedet materialr from those of rhich it Is been formed up to the presene time. Dearly-bought experienoe bas proved the neoeseity of having in that country a far greater body of English soldiers than the parsimony of the Hon. Rsst India Compan^y haz hitherto allowed; but the climate alone of IPdia winl prevent our being able to maintain a footing there withouo the co-oOeration of coloured troope. Neither indigenoto Hindoos nor Mahommedans are apparently to ba trustedArabs inlght, it is true, be subsidized, but they wouIdproye tiouble3ome customers. Negro regiments could be raisel for Indian service in the West Indies or the Western Coast of Africa, but (supposing always that we could indgoe the a to " takc the shiBlinge and to expatriate themselves for a certain length of time) there are no troops of that desorip. tion who would be found more efioient than the Kaffirs, or even the Fingoes of our own settlements in Southera Afrioa; 8,000 or 10,000 of these fine stalwart fellows, driled as light infantry and properly commanded, would be a matoh for " lakhs" of Asiatcs ;. heat, fglUgue, privatiLon and danger they would se' at naught, and could suffiient inducements be only held out to tempt a few thousands of them to cross the " great water," they would not only d* good service in lindostan, but relieve the colonists of our eastern provinces at the Cape froia as many slippery anl troublesome neighbours. SoutherA Africa could also supply excellent coloured cavalry; few bodies of horse can be, for desultory or irregular warfare, more efflicieAt than onr gallant " Cape Mounted Rifles," chiegy composed of Hottentots, to wrhom a tropical climate would be congenial, and whose light weigtt would be well dapted to the small breed of horses in the East.

ZUA (Zi-GAli ARTILLEBY. TO TEZ EDITOR OF THE T9IES. Slr,-I trust you will conider the following remarks worthy of Insertion. There existed, I believe, in former years a positive order that no native was to enter a magazine or laboratory on any pretext whatever, the mixing of the composItions used in the manufacture of ganpowdor, fusees, rocketi, &c,, being entirely performed by the hands of Europeans, And the natives being kept in profound ignoranoe of these Important duties. This restrlction has for many years been disregarded, asnd natives have not only shared these labours, but have even been instructed in matters relating to the artillery depart. ment. The natives make excellent artillerymen, and stioc to their guns, for which they have a sort of saperstitious veneration, to the very la6t extremity. This innovatbin therefore, has in the present emergency proved highly in. jurious to oar Government, as is shown by the able msaner in whioh our own guns have been directed against us. In the reorganization of the Bengal artillery I woul I suggest that the regiment should be composed entirely of Enropeans, and that the magazines sad laboratories shoul I I e again closed to the natives, except as regards the cavalry and infantry departments. The reserve companies, whic' in the time of peace have absolutely no employment, wsonl I supply sfficient men to p2rform the work of the abova establishments, and would, in the event of an outbreak, ba useful and efficient guards for the same. We have seen that a few Europeans, with six guns, at Benares were sufficesnt to disperse three regiments of nxtives; it is not unreasonable, then, to suppose that if th3 artillery at Nasseerabad and Neemuch had been iaropaan instead of native, the resalt of the conafict at the former place would have been the reverse of what it was, and much of the bloodshed at the latter would have beea prevented. The extra expense of this arrangement would be trifling compared with the advautages gained. The articles would b3 better made, the magazines would be in trustworthy bands, the men would be provided with employment, and would b3 under the supervision of the Ordnance Commissalat officers, theneglected state of the reserve companies for wantor officers having long been a subject of anxious consideration. Jf a few thousnd Europeans are to rule million of AsiAtics, must it not he by superior intelligence, combined with ipernor sill and science in military as well as civil mstters? Are we so blind to onr own interest as to place at the disposal of those who are only too eNer to subvert our rulesall the applance of modern ttnienhfio warfare? By depriving the natives of guns anad keeping them iu ignoranoe of tbe use of artillery we sallat allevents haveantinmn4e aedvantage over them. B. Aug. 17.

LONDOW, FBIDA Y. AUGUST 21, 1867. In the House of Lords last night, Lord REDZsDALM gave notice that he should oppose the consideration of the Commons' amendments of the Divorce Bill. In the House of Commons, at the early sitting, the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill, as amended in the Committee, was considered, and further amendments were made, including fresh clauses substituted for a elause added in the Committee for establishing local jurisdiction. The Bill was ordered to be read a third time this day. The Sale of Obscene Books, &c., Prevention Bill, as amended in the Committee, was likewise oonsidered and further amended, Scotland being exoluded from the operation of the BilL In the evening, in reply to MTr. SpooxnE, Lord PALmfasToN stated that the Commissioners appointed by the protecting Powers to inquire into the finances of Greece had not yet made a report; but he was afraid he could not hold out any expectation that the result would relieve the British Governmeat from the obligation to pay the interest on the loan. In answer to inquiies by Mr. DISAB, Mr. V. SsvTH corrected a misapprehension of a reply he 'had given on Tuesday, relative to the compensation to be given by the Indian Government for losses sustained in consequence of the mutiny of the troops. The scheme of compensation to which he referred, he said, did not extend to property injured or destroyed belonging to all British subjects, which would open a wide field. On the order for the tbird reading of the Militia Bill, a discussion of much interest zrose, in whioh Colonel NoxTH, Sir F. SaiTn, Sir DE LAcy EVANS, Sir W. WIAMa, Sir H. VzENzy, and Sir J. RAmsDmN participated, and which gradually embraced a great varety of topics, including the seige of Delhl, the expediency of sending Sappers and Miners to India, and of employing a steam flotllla on the Ganges, recruiting for the native army of Bombay, the electric telegraph, the conveyance of troops to India throuigh Egypt, and sending them iu screw line-of-battle ships. Lord PA_T mroTQ in tQ( courV of a generAI reply, pointed out the Inexpediency of sending a large portion of our naval force so far a India, and repeated the objections he had previously urged to the conveying troops across E3gypt. As to the ernpcying of a flotilla on the Ganges, he reminded the House that the rivers of India were thickly studded with sand-banks and abounded ith shallows. He assuredthe House, however, that the suggestions made would receive the utmost attention of the Govermment, which wai most anxiously directed to the sad events in India. Mr. DsRAELI said he wished to see a nearer relation established between the regular regiments of the Line and the Militis, which would be of advantage to both. Adverting to the operations in India, be observed that much depended upon the fate of Ca'wnpore, the defence of which was, in his opinion, a more important point than the re-capture of Delhi. Hte wished to know what portion of his garrison the Governor of the Cape was prepared to contribute to the European force in India, there being, he believed, no danger of a Caffre war. In reply to Lord PAnWARON, he considered what were the duties of Government, in questions of retrenchment, with relation to the exigencies of the country. The Government, he said, ought to have been aware of the condition of our Indian empire, and preseient of what would happen there, and they could not relieve themselves of responsibility for Banctioring a policy of reduction, which was most unwise, and had been most injurious to the country. Mfr. V. SriTR denied that the Government were in any way responsible for the events in India, and defended the maeasures taken by them for expediting reinforcements thither. They had, he said, sent positive instructions to Sir GEORGB GRBY to forward two regiments frora the Cape to India, and as many more troops as he could spare, and he (Mr. V. Sarn) had not the slightest fear that Sir GxonGB would carry out the instructions with spirit and promptitude. There had been no lack of consideration as to the force necessary to put down the mutiny. After that was done measures would be taken to reorganize the army in India, making a large addition of European force. Mr. HxBnzy protested against any reproach being cast upon the House for having obliged the Government to reduce unduly the establishments of the country. Mr. SpooxzR lamented that no distinct and specific recognition had come from either Lord PALsmsToN or Mr. Sm of our entire dependence for success in India upon the blessing of PRovIDENCE. The Bill was read a third time and passed. The House then proceeded to consider the reasons of the Lords for disagreeing to several of the Commons' amendments in the Dulwich College Bill. In the course of the discussion Mr. KNIG}T delivered a speech vehemently inculpating the College authorities. The Crowded Dwellings Prevention Bill was withdrawn. Mr. H. HERBERT obtained leave to bring in a Bill to regulate markets and fainr in Ireland. After some further business, the House adjourned ak balf-past 10 o'clock.
It is a very natural but not a very politic course in the presence of a great danger, to forget that more serious damage may arise from what is unseen and unsuspected than from the evil against which we are called upon immediately to combat. AUl energies are braced, all resources are exhausted, to meet the one obvious and immediate peil. It is for the moment forgotten that the concentration of energy upon one point may invite attack from other quarters, and that the exhaustion consequent upon efforts above our strength may render us incapable of dealing with other attacks as we might have done had we husbanded our powers. Lord PAiznsTwr urged this point with very considerable force last night upon the attention of the House of Commons, in answer to those gentlemen who pressed him to forward the reinforcements for India in our war steamers. The spepe.b war worthy of the First Minister's great experience, and may be accepted as quite conclusive upon the point. Let 'us look at the present posture of our affairs. We had greatly reduced our military and naval establishments at the concluaion of the Russian War, when suddenly this Indian Mutiny came upon us like a thunderclap. The natural consequence has been that, in order to forward to India the necessary reinforcements, we have been compelled to denude these islands-the seat of empire-of troops, and even to withdraw regiments from many of our colonial possessions. As to our colonies, as long as the supremacy of England remains intact any evil which may afflict them can be but of a transitory nature. The main difficulty once settled in Bengal we could easily turn round and make short work with lesser offenders. For the moment, then, we wouldI confine attention to the military position of these islands. It is no secret that very shortly the number of regular troops retained at home will be of the most insignificant amount. In order to fill up the vacancies, powers have been taken to call out 10,000 of the Militia. In case of emergency these young soldiers would, no doubt, fight on their oWn soil, and for the defence of their native land, as their fathers have fought before them with less training under their banners than they will have received. By thousands levies of armed men could be gathered from the country districts and from the towns, and these could in a few weeks be taught all that it was most important for them to know. We do not, however, wish to be thrown upon any of those heroic eforts which, however creditably they may figure in the page of history, press somewhat severely upon those whose energies are taxed for their performance. What, then, remains? We must for the moment trast for the defence of our shores to the same machinery which has so long preserved them unpolluted from the tread of the foreign invader-that is, to the Navy. Now, the most efficient, indeed, the only efficient, portion of the Navy for war purposes at sea, under the improved' systems of navigation, is the steam fleet. It would, therefore, be highly impolitic in a moment of enthusiasm to despatch our principal war steamers as transports to the other side of the globe. We could not, if we did so, hope to find them within reach in case any fresh difficulty should occur of a more serious character than the Sepoy Mutiny. In saying thus much, and in calling attention to the very emphatic language in which the First Mnister expressed his views upon this point last night, we would not be taken as alarmists. The chance of incurring such a reproach must not, however, prevent us from advocating those salutary measures of precaution which appear absolutely necessary, if we would maintain Great Britain free from even the possibility of insult. We do not, indeed, any longer believe in invasions, or in the success of them. I' we have derived no other advantage from the Russian War, at least the history of the earth. works in the Crimea has given us a shrewd hint as to the powers of the spade in defensive warfare. It should be remembered, however, that this country may incur danger of a very serious character in consequence of possible changes in the policy, even of possible changes in the constitution, of the continental Governments. It cannot, for example, b3 denied that the stability of European policy at the preEent Imoment appears to rest upon that single life which represents the hearty alliance between France and England. We, in oommon with all whose intere3ts are involved in the tranquillity of Europe, have every reason to hope that the life of the Emperor of the F=Ncs may long be preserved, but still mortality has but a frail tenure of it at best. Come what may, a nation so powerful as England cmu hwve nothing to fear, but it is prti- dent to be prepared against aU contingencies. Nothing, then, could be more impolitic than to weaken the naval defences of the country by despatching a considerable section of our steam fleet to a distant quarter of the globe at the very time we are under the absolute necessity of draining these islands of trained troops. Nor is this drain merely a temporary one-it must continue for a considerable period, even when the jMutiny in Bengal has been subdued. Whatever may be the decision at which we may ultimately arrive with regard to the reorganization of the Bengal Army, it is quite clear that for the next three or four years a very large European force must be maintained in that portion of British India. During this period we shall be called upon to supply not only the deficiency caused by the annual mortality insepaable from the ordinary employment of European troops in so siiltry a region, bat we fear that this usual and normal deficiency will be greatly increased by the character of the service which those troops will be called upon to perform until the disturbed districts have been thoroughly pacified. It is perfectly true that the financial burden will be cast upon the Indian Exchequer; but it is also true that recruiting cannot be pushed beyond a certain point without serious disturbance of the labourmarket at home. On any great emergency we doubt not England would rise equal to the occasion, but, meanwhile, the army must reestablish our rule in the North-Western Provinces of India, and the Navy must guard our shores, and impart to the power of England its due weight in the councils of Europe and of the world. The simple fact is, that at the conclusion of the Russian War we reduced our military establishment in an unwise degree. The pressure of a few Parliamentary orators was irre sistible in the direction of economy, and so enormous had been the sacrifices made by the nation during the contest with Russia, and so cheerfully had those sacrifices been borne, that there was a natural desire to reduce its burdens as soon as possible. Lord PAL- ERsTroN, in his address to the House last night, pointed out very forcibly the advantages and disadvantages consequent upon our system of representative government, as opposed to those which result from a government based upon the will of one man. " A " despotic Government," said Lord PALasnSToN, "being subject to no control but its own "will, and possessing the foresight which you "must assume all governors of countries to have, "keeps up in time of peace a larger force than is "actually requisite for defence, and when war unfortunately occurs it is at once ready to meet "tha pressure which is thereby occasioned." That is the case of Russia, of Austria, of France, andin a less degree of the lesser despotic Governments of the European continent ; but mark the reverse of the medal :-" On the other hand, when war " does brea-k out, then comes the advantage of "representative institutions, because then it is that "the whole nation, raUying round the Government, "gives to it a support and a force which no "despotic Government can by any means or any "possibility possess." We are not disposed to quael with our own portion in this contrast. Whatever might have been the case at the commencement of the Russian War, its conclusion found England armed with a power which was just beginning to appreciate itself-with energy unwearied, with spirit unflagging, and eager to continue the contest. The same assertion could not be made with truth of any other nation which took part in the struggle. Still we may trust that our economists, taught by the experience of the past, may henceforward aDpreciate the great truth that their theories may be as misplaced with reference to the military establishments of a great nation as to the conduct of a private business. True economy is that which prodaces the greatest results at the smallest expense, not at a given moment only, but when subjected to the test of years.
The evidence which is appended to the Report on the Purchase of Commissions contains a great proportion of ingenious speculations, some elaborate statistical tables, and a certain admixture of vhat may properly be caUed facts. It may even be observed that the results of experience are often to be found in the questions, and that the witnesses only supply the theoretical explanations. Parliamentary and official language is much in want of a term to describe the valuable masses of information which are laid before Committees and Royal Commissions. The opinions of able men on matters of public concern are highly valuable and useful, but the assertions that " purchase maintains "I the social position of the army," and that " com" petition would increase its efficiency," ought not to be mistaken for evidence. Sir CnA=s TxavmYAN has perhaps transacted more public business in detail than any man now living in England; but the activity of his mind has habitually led him to travel beyond the circle of his mere official duties. As the most thorough-going advocate for competition in the civil service, he is naturally hostile to the system of purchase in the army, and a complete statement of the arguments against the existing practice might easily be compiled from his voluminous evidence. Nine-tenths, however, of the answers which bear his name might equally have been laid before the Committee by any person of like ability and zeal who had never been within the walls of a public office. In this case, as in many others, it may be repeated that the evidence is not evidence, but hypothesis, argument, and inference. Sir C. T.EvELYAN'S well-earned reputation entitles his opinions to careful consideration; but his reasons must be considered to rest on their own strength, and not on the authority of the individual by whom they are propounded. Even the able and elaborate scheme for the future establishment of the army which is set out in the appendix might have been framed by a mere theorist, with no further materh-is than the published statistical returns. The Assistant-Secretary of the Treasury, whatever may be the value of his more general suggestions, fails to meet the financial difficulty of a change. The estimated tetat of purchase-money invested in commissions is no less than 7,000,0001., and if the present system were summarily abolished a large portion of that sum must be repaid, at the public expense, to those who have rdvanced it. It world be absurdly unjust to equire every officer to make an instantaneous .hoice between retirement on receiving the price of his commission, and continuance in ihe service at the cost of forfeiting Iris investment. If the offer of payment were generally accepted, the State, in return for an enormous outlay, would find itself suddenly without an rmy. The alternative result would only prove what the bulk of the offlcer preferred the confiscation of their property to the loss of their profession. On second thoughts Sir C. T=vLwELYA proposes to leave the question open, so that each individual may select his own time for retirement; but with the removal of injustice the difficulty of expense revives. If the operation were spread over 20 years the country would have to pay somewhat rIore than the purchase-money, which will actually be transferred from hand to hand if the present system is maintained. As promotion became slower the inducements to sell out would be greater, and consequently the saving by death or by pro- motion to the rank of Major-General would be pro, portionally diminished. Sir a. TnIVELYAN proposes an increase of pay in the lower ranks, a diminution of the allowances granted under various warrants, a reduction in the establishment of General officers, the abolition of rewards for service, and a large saving in half-pay and in pensions to widows. On the whole, his scheme increases the charge of the effective services by 31,6121., and reduces the non-effective charge by 113,4781., leaving a balance in favour of the State of 81,8661. It is difficult to believe that so experienced a public servant can regard with confidence the practical abolition of widows' pensions. The sympathy of the country and of the House of Commons would inevitably defeat to a considerable extent any economical calculations founded on tbeoretical justice. It would not be easy to explain the reasons for an invidious distinction between an army deprived of the power of purchaso and a navy which nerer thought of purchasing. tTniformity would be restored, not by leaning the sailor's widow penniless, but by restoring the pension to the sister service and by upsetting the balance provided in the blue-book. Another proposed saving may be put out of consideration, as not necesarily connected with a change of system. If the sum of 42,0001. now paid for agency might be diepensed with by iatrusting the duty to officers, it would seem that so simple a reform is equally compatible with seniority, with selection, or with puTchase. Regimental officers and non-commissioned officers might, perhaps, do the work cheaply, but they would certainly not do it gratuitously. In any case the item may safely be set aside as owcarring on both sides of the equation. A similar remark will apply to the readjustment of pay and of allowances as far as the additional outlay balances the saving. If the public money is injudiciously distributed among the officers of a regiment it would be much easier to correct existing anonalies, without loss or gain to the collective body, than to introduce a new principle of promoton. The allowances which have been granted at different times for special services are, in Sir C. TRLr1xYLy'S opinion, awkward contrivances to compensate for the sacrifice made by officers who are practically unpaid; but a direct and undisguised increase of Pay would have precisely the same effect. The reduction in the list of General officers furnishes an obvious mode of saving, but it is not less clear that it would necessarily retard promotion. It is, however, true that the amount expended in the pay of Generals and in half-pay may in some degree be eonsidered as an equivalent. for the loss suffered by an officer who has not retired on the sale of his commission. The proportion of the charge, which may be fairly attributed to the purchase xsytem is not easily determined, nor is much light thrown on the problem by a comparison with those serviees in which purchase is unknown. The Duke of SoiExssr and Air. ELr.Oc repeatedly pressed upon Sir C. TnEvimYx the consideration that almost all the payments which he represented as -excessive are allowed to the Atillery and to the Engineers, an well as to the Guards and to the Line. The answer that the scale applied to the larger body neeessarily extended to the smaller branch, though relevant and suggestive, was certainly not sufficient. Mr. SIDNEY HunnBT'S inquiry how an offier under the proposed system could dispense with the allowanees which the Waroffice has hitherto found indispensable remained altogether unanswered. A more remarkable objection is suggested by a comparison between the amy aud the navy. Officers in the sea.aervice are permitted to receive halfpay, pensions are awarded to their widows, and the non-effective charge on the p~ablic purse is larger in proportion for the navy than for the army. The explanation that a system of extravagance, generated by regimental purchase, has extended through all departments of the public service is here entirely inapplicable. The advautages allowed to naval offlicers have been eonsiderably increased in recent times, in pursuance of real or supposed expediency and justice, and in entire accordance witth public feeling. To be consistent, Sir C. TntVaLYAE must contemplate the impracticable task of imposing on the navy, without any equivalent, the reductions which he would justify in the case of future bolders of military commissions by relieving them of the burden of purchase. Ib is not enough to answer that we must do one thing at a time. We must also be prepared at a future time to abide by the legitimate consequences of what we are doing now. If the new financial scheme cannot be extended to the navy it may be regarded as having altogether broken down. The sea service ought to be carefully studied by all army reformers. Excluding purchase, and providing officers who are gentlemen and yet not amateurs, the naval system seems to show that the sale of commissions is not indispensable, but it certainly fails to prove that there would be any cheapness in a change. Investigation will only lead to the conolusion which might be as3umed from the begisning,-that it will cost more to pay our officers than to obtain their services for nothing. The financial argument for a change of system is therefore illusory. The practical reasons which. may be thought to recommend it are. wholly indepoindent of money.
The rate at which the improvement and adornment of Paris have been going on has, it seeas, alarmed the Parisians themselves, and the Prefect of the Seine bas just published a report on the finances of the city in order to quiet public apprehension, sad prove that " if a certain boldness iseems to inspire the acts of the Municipality, cc prudence is not excluded from its councils." The report shows that, though " so many great " enterprises have been undertaken during the " last few years," the outgoings have not exceeded the incomings, but, on the contrary, left a surplus. From 1853 to 185T inchlsive the total of " extraordinary" experses has been 93,000,000f. The " extraordinary" expenses include as their main items public works and buildings, which come to 47,000,000f., and hydraulic works and improvemaent of streets, the latter item being more than 33,000,000f. The rate of expenditure is slightly increasing, the improvements of Paris for 1856 covering more than 21,000,000f., and those of the current year a Bum not estimated at less. It was this not only undiminished, but growing expenditure, which excited, we presume, the alarm which the present report is intended to meet. The embellishments of the Bois de Boulogne have consumed nearly 5,000,000f. The Racecourse at Longchamp, the Avenue de rlImp6ratrice, the Boulevards de Sebastopol and Da Nord, the Sorbonne, the Schools, the Institute of the Empress, the Hotel de Ville, the Prefecture of Police, &e., compose the list of improvements. We turn now to the other side of the sheet, and find the Iunicipality of Paris coming out triumphantly, the surplus of 1856 upon the whole of the receipts and the whole of the expenditure, ordinary and extraordinary, of the city, being 32,000,000f.,and of the current year 20,000,000f. We gather, however, that this surplus is necessay to pay off some loaus. In going over the receipt side of the account we see that municipal taxation is more commanding, fertile, and ingenious among our neighbours than with ourselves. There is, in the first place, the Votent octroi, yielding in the last 45,000,000f. The sites in -the Ohamps ElyEed anud Bois de Boulogne, the boats on tffe Littz lakes, the chairs on the public promenades, er. bine with cabs, omnibuses, and g=apipes to fill tha treasury of the city, the wForld overground and the world below being alike farmed or let to companies. But no source of revenue. is despised; " the herbs and cattings of trac in I "the public gardens" are sold, and the "rnght ta "dcAcharge disimfected liquid into the .guttM" brings an annual sum or nearly S00OOOf. Thr is a tax on burials. We observe that the asitance received from Government during the five years is put at only 6,000,000f. Our Parisian neighbour. ought to excite our emulation. These are the exertions of the Muni. cipality of Paris, not of the Executive G( ernment, with the full command of the national pulse. The sum w-hich the Government has conri4butei is an insignificant one compared -with the whole amount. Ia there more architectural life among our neighbours than among ouradves r Do Parisians care more about Paria than Londoners do about London ? Perhaps they do. Londoners do not profess any particular pride inL their metropolis; it is a usefil, a very usefa place, a sort of general shop or " store," ax our American friends call it, for the whole country. It is growing more and more every day the place at which " to get everything," to get a multitude of household articles -whiclt nobody dreamt of buying but in the nearest market town twenty years ago. Your tailor, shoemaker, and winemerchant live in London. London custom is, in fact, deteriorating country shops, which fall with the deprivation ci custom, and so the argument for London shops is always by a natural law increasing. But, while Londoa works for the whole country, its great Ise as " store" is & great intercepter of sentiment. Country people think they do quite enough for London and. show abundant zeal for its welfare and improvement if they pay their bills. don people think they do quite enough for Lendoxt by condescending to make their money there. They look upon the metropolis U a place to be away from. Happy the man who is always le"ring London, and always goiog to sorne nice healthy, airy place or other, whigh simply reainds him of the metropolis by its contrast. Nature is loved andcourted not so much in itself as because it is not London-because it is supposed to carry on a mute protest against all smoke and dirt, all close atmosphere and poisonous smells, and especially the smoke, dirt, atmosphere, and amelis of London. Brighton, Richmond, Norwood, and a hundred suburbs and wateringplaces are the real residences of a Londonei, who aspes to the ubiquity of a spiit, to tenant earth, air, sea, and ab-r in general. !HEle isa iwayn onght and imagination out of London, and either breathing his native Yorkshir, or Berkshire air in some place on the wolds or on the heathis whic he left, like WwnTmoroN, fifty years ago to fulfil a fortunate destiny and shine ilt i the city, or reposingin some choice paradise of his own creation in Srrey or Kent, onthe bmks of the Thames, or tedway. Thus, Londoners are the last ipeople tocare much abot London. Itisrather their pride to have-and to own as little connexion with the place a& possible. Let everything connected -with the transaction of busin in the place be convenient, and the whole mwachinery of locomotiol perfect; let the police guard his pockets, and the fireman proteet hbis premises, but he does not, much care about the architecture of London; this or that ugly and obstructive block of houses is nob an eyesore to him; he does not long indignantly for openings and clearings. Of course,, we do not deny at all the existence of a patriotic cols of Londoners who take an interest in these things, and whose zeal makes moves from time to time and causes improvements. But the tendenoy is in the luke. warm direction. Nor is it easy to say how this is to be mended, because the loo3e relations in which so large a class of the wealthiest men staud to the metropolis lead so naturally to this indifference. It is true we have done somiething lately in this line, and interest is awakened; but why is not Holywell-street and the same obstruction in Parliament-street removed t Otur neighbours in Paris would have cleared away these nuisances long ago. But Parisians look on Paris as a home, and are proud to say tlat they live there. Londoners only tolerate London for their convenience. Paris is the ornament, Id London is the useful place, of the respectiVe eountries. What delays again a new Westminster-bridge? The erection of a new Government office is a Government affair; but the sooner, if not ornamental, at any rate safe habitations, are built for Ministers the better. We are glad to see that Sir BmTNJi HLrL, holds out a. fair hope of the completion of Battersea Park, Chelsea-bridge and embankment, the Pimlico improvements, and the uiew street in Spitalfields. The sum required for the completion of these undertaking is 170,0001., but the First Commis-. sioner considers that the sale of the Government property at Batterses and the frontages in Spitalfields and Pimlico will not only cover this sum, but leave a considerable surplus towards repaying the 200,0001. advanced by the Excheqaer Loan Commisaioners for the formation of Batterae8 Park.

SECOND EDITION. I .HE _E Frid Morn I TIIF TIAfESOFFICB, Fri-daii Momintg. I EXPRESS FROM PARIS. 'The following is the letter of our Paris corre. pondent, dated yesterday (Thursday), 6 p.m.:- To-day's Siacle corrects with great justice some illtEounded statements of the Debats with respect to the -value that the Treaty of Paris accords to the opL mions of the Moldo-Wallachian Divans regarding thefinal settlement of those provinces. The Debats vriting without looking at the treaty, and evidently ,oblivious of its exact tenour, assumes that the de cision of the Divans is to be final, and is necessarily to be confirmed by the Plenipotentiaries of the European Powers. A glance at the protocols will ghow that th7s is by no means what is there set down. Regard Is to be had to the wishes of the Moldo-Wallachians as far as they can be -ascertained, but the Paris Conference is not to be bound by them, Bince it must also consider and provide for the interests of Europe. According -to the Debats, the Conference will be held merely -to recogaize and sanction the views of the Divans. This is a grievous misconception. It would be imprudent (to use the mildest term) to suffer the representative assemblies of the provinces thus definitively to decide the important question at issue. Supposing that the elections be ultimately conducted with perfect fairness-which it is difficult to believe that they will be in a country where the higher classes are notoriously corrupt, the lower orders profoundly ignorant, and where it will be impossible wholly to prevent the exertion of Turkish influence-can it be reasonably expected that the Divans will be competent to pronounce without appeal on the fate of their country ? They are to represent the four classes into -which, for purposes of political consideration, -the Moldo-Wallachian population may be broadly -divided. These are, first, the Boyards, many of them of Fanariot families, and most of them well lkuown as selfish in their views and devoid of patriotism. Then you have a class of young men, .chiefly of Boyard families, but whose ultra-liberal ideasgo farbeyondwhat thereal intellectual condition and capacity of their countrymen admit of; they have been educated, or have resided in countries more advanced in civlization, more capable of selfgovernment; and they would fain apply at home -theories they have imbibed abroad. The middle -cls in the Principalities is increasing in mtelligence and importance, but is still composed in great part of foreigners and Jews, engaged in various trades, -and who cannot be supposed to cherish a strong feeling of nationality; while the small landed proprietors, the Moshnemis, out of whom somnthing may hereafter be made, are at present little superior in intelligence and mental cultivation to the unfortinate and degraded peasantry, from whose ill-requited labour the Boyards derive the means of living in luxury. To any one who is personally acquainted with the -Principalities it will seem scarcely possible that, by any form of election, and however vigilant the watch against corruption and illicit Jnfluence, assemblies can be got together competent finally to pronounce on their futnre constitution and mode of administration. The materials, in fact, are not there. And truly those writers are no real friends of the MoldoWallachians who would place such powers in their hands. Of the utility of calling together the Divans there can be no doubt, but it were better to assemble none than to make their decision irrevocable. To do this was certainly never the intention of the Paris Confe.rence, nor, as the D6bats will find, was it so laid down in the treaty. It wo,u' I be like allowing sick children to prescribe for themselves; for cbildren, in point of political education, the Moldo-Wallachians unquestionably are. There have now been for some time in the country, and will probably be for some months longer, the commissioners of the chief European Powers, men of sagacity and experience, who, if they make a good use of their opportunities, will be able to form a juster opinion of what is good for the peoDle of the Principalities than could these for themselves. ; t is by their report more than, or at least as much as, by the votes of the Divans, that the Paris Conference should be guided when this important matter comes to be finally discussed and settled. As regards the union of the Principalities and their erection into a State, under a foreign prince, this idea, originated in the first instance with a small number of men, some of them young and ardent, who thought their country capable of leaping, at one bound, from the unfortunate condition of misgoverned provinces of TIurkey into an independent constitutional kingdom that might soon vie with Sardinia or Belgium in progress, prosperity, and enlightenment. MoldoWallach,a or Roumania was to be the Belgium of the East, and great pains were taken to propagate this idea, and to get it adopted by the masses as enthusiasticaly as it had been by the tetes exnltis with whom it originated. Suddenly, in the summer of '56, the French agent at Bucharest, previously a staunch upholder of Stirbey and his misdeeds, came out as a vehement supporter of this bazardous project. How far his reports and representations may have influenced his Government to espouse the cause of the union to the extent to which it has lately been asserted to do so cannot, of course, be known. That agent, how- ever, is now no longer the chief representative and informant in the Principalities of theFrenchGovern ment, and it may be expected that M. de Talley. rand will come to a less hasty and juster conclusion respecting what will really be to the advantage of Moldo-Wallachia and in confor mnity with the interests of Europe. France can have no selfish views or ambitious designs in the matter. Her interest, like that of England, can only be to preserve the provinces from the grasp of Russia, of whose greedy desires they have been and wiU ever be the object, and whose influence and opportunities in Moldavia and Wallachia would, --there is much reason to apprehend, be augmented no little by their virtual separation from Turkey and amalgarnation into a feeble independent State. By telegraph we have intelligence from Jassy up 'io the 15th inst. News had been received there of all that had pased in Western Europe with respect to the Moldavian elections, including the result of -the meeting at Oaborne. As might be supposed, imnense excitement prevailed. A number of depu-ties had given in their resignation, in order not to -occasion. any embarrassment or impede the new. measures teat were to be taken. Many of these depuaties are anti-unionists. A despatch from Con:stantinople announces that, up to the evening of -the 18th inst., the new Ottoman Ministry had not ~been constitute'. Despatches have been received at the French Foreign-office from M. Gobineau, acting French Charg9 d'Affaires at Teheran. The news of the iuntiny in Bengal had caused a prodigious sensaIon in Persia. Fearing disturbances, the Shah had ,determined not to reduce his army for the present. Orders have been sent by telegraph to Admiral Tr6houart to despatch two of the vessels undcx his icmmand to Tunis The budget of the Minister of War, which zamounts, for the present year, to 340,223,143f., ,will be increased, for next year, to 346,729,607f. Tho effective force of the army will be 392,400 men and 83,500 horses. The number of pupils in the military schools will be reduced as follows :-The Polytechnic, from 510 to 390; the School of Application for the Staff, from 90 to 60; St. Cyr from 1,200 to 920. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, shortly after the arrival of the Royal yacht on Tuesday morning at Cherbourg, landed, and, after visiting the arsenal, made an excursion by land to several places in the neighbourhood of the town, again going on board at 8 in the evening. The yacht remained during the night at anchor in sight of sCherbourg, and left the next morning about 5. She steered direct for Jersey, which place Her Majesty visited in the course of the forenoon. Prince Jerome yesterday morning embarkod on board the Ariel steamer at Havre, and went to make a short excursion along the coast to TrouviUe and Honfleur. The Prince returned in the evening. Queen Maria Christina is expected at Biarritz. This looks as if she were about to return to Spain. In Madrid a strong report to that effect has lately been current. It is said that her daughter wishes to have her near her at the period of her acctchem.ent, expected to take place in October. The Pays says:- " The illustrious author of Guillatzme Tell has decidedly fixed his residence at Paris. In October next he will leave Auteuil and install himself in an apartment on tho first floor at the corner of the Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin. The workmen are busy preparing it, and Rosini comes almost daily to see how they get on with it. It is positive thathe is now much occupied with an important work. As yet he has told no one what it is, but it may nevertheless be positively affirmed that it strongly resembles an opera." The Customs' receipts for the month of July amount to 15,706,790f., being a decrease on the corresponding month of last year of 783,7o0,f. The first seven months of the present year produced 111,328,790f., being 10,806,399f. more than in the corresponding period of 1856. The items of revenue which have shown the greatest improvement during the seven months of 1857 are foreign sugar, 6,301,992f. ; coffee, 5,069,751f.; potable liquors, 4,795,247f.; oleaginous seeds, 942,987f. ; hemp, 729,069. ; linen and hempen cloth, 476,253f. ; coal, 261,614f. ; nitrates of potash and soda, 75,723 f.; gold and silver, 78,947f; mahogany, 33,711f.; indigo, 17,752f. ; bar steel, 21,039£ ; zinc, 16,098f.

The Ministerial Correspondenz of to-day thus announces to the Austrian public the result of the conferences which a few days since were held at Osborne on the subject of the Moldavian elections: It affords us great satisfaction to be able to state, that in consequence of the visit paid by the Emperor of the French to Her Britannic Majesty, that lamentable dispute at Constantinople, which led to the interruption of the diplo. matic relations betweon the Porte and severid of the European Powers, is likely to be settled to the atisfaction of all parties. As is known, the DrenchAmbassador raised objections to the validity of the Moldavian elections, and demanded that they should be repe^ted. It is also notorious that his demand was supported by the representatives of Prussia, Russia, and Sardinia. Aithough the Porte sin. cerely wisbed to satisfy France, it was unable to accede to a request to which neither Austria nor England was a party. Elad the representatives of the two last-mentioned States counseUled the Porte to yield, they would have excluded themselves from any share in the settlement of a matter which-according to the conditions of the Treaty-ought to be regulated by the common accord of the Powers. " The exchange of ideas and opinions between the French and English Governments has done away with the misunderstanding. After it had become clear that there was no difference of opinion on fundamental points (princip. Fragen), the difference which had arisen at Constantinople about an incidental case (incidce=-punc7d) became a matter of inferior moment, and was easy to settle. The Emperor of the French invited Austria and England to take into con. sideration the state of things in Constantinople, and they, although they could not but approve the condnct of the Porte in declining to accede to a demand to which they were not parties, being willing to satisfy France, expressed their readiness to assist in restoring a good understanding in the Turkish capitaL In respect to the Porte it may be observed, that it can, without disparagement to its dignity or interests, make that concession to all the Powers whicb, as a party to the Treaty of Paris, it was unaWbe to make to only some of them. The Austrian and English Cabinets have now advised the Porte to have the electoral lists revised, and to proceed to new elotlions, and it is to be expected that the Turkish Government wiU yield to a wish that has been expressed by all its allies, " We are sincerely ploased that things have taken such a turn, and cherish a well-founded hope that the re-organizatiozn of the Danubian Principalities will at no distant period be effected in a way which will conducoe to the welfare and prosperity of those courntries without infringing on the rights of the ' Suzerin' Power." As the Saltan expresaed his readiness to agree to a repetition of the Moldavian elections, the representatives of France, Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia lost no time in renewing their diplomatic relations with the Porte, and already on the 10th inst. the Turkish Minister was officially informed that the four diplomatists had again taken the subjects of their respective Sovereigns under their protection, It is also stated that the note in which Lord Redcliffe and Baron Prokesch took on themselves the responsibility for any unpleasant consequences which might arise to the Porte from the precipitate eler_ tions in Moldavia is to be considered " non-existing." The interpretation here given to the expression quoted is that the British and Austrian Govem- ments have considered it advisable tacitly to express their disapproval of the conduct of their diplomatic agents. The Austrian Cabinet probably flattered itself that the validity of the Moldavian elections would not be seriously questioned, but it certainly never even dreamt of empowering Baron Prokesch to give such a pledge as he did to the Porte. The prevalent opinion in the diplomatic world is that the passions of the representatives of Great Britain and Auatria overcame their judgment. The newe received from the Caucasus by the last mail is diametrically opposed to that forwarded from St. Petersburg a few days sirnce. Sefer Bey announces that 10,000 Circassians, under the command of Mehemed Bey (the Hungarian Bangya), and M. Stankajevich, a Belgiau officer of artillery, have totally defeated General Filipson on the banks of the Kuban, which river divides the country inhabited by the Tchernowarish Cossacks from that part of the Caucasus which is peopled by the various tribes popularly known as " the Cicassians." The Russians, who are said to have been pursued as far as Rostow and Tamor, lost six gans and 64 packh(oses. The foregoing intelligence may or may nob be correot, but Schamyr' subjoined procla.atizLmvAt be Considered a kind of proof thpet, Eome advantages of importance have been obtained over the Russians on the Caspian coast'of the Cauea3ian isthmus. The tale told is, that Schamyl, with an army of 25,000 men, was encamped.on the banks of a river called Koyau, and that the Russians resolved to attempt to dislodge him, as the position commanded the passes of the Tachetachna. Accordingly, the Russian army advanced in two divisions under the command of Generals Nicolai and Rudanowsky. General Nioolai was kept in check by a chief named Hadji Meerad, but Rudanowsky was boldly attacked by Schamyl, who, after a battle which lasted 10 hours, aucceeded in driving his enemy across the Koysn. The result of Schamyrs victory was that several blockhouses fell into his hands, fortified places which had been built by the Russians at a prodigious sacrifice of time, money, and life for the maintenance of the communication between Kizlar on the river Terek, and Derbend on the Caspian. Schamyl's proclamation runs as follows "In the name of the great and merciful God and of His soWe prophet, I make known unto you, my faithful friends, that I would rather die fightlng against the enemies of the true faith than permit theo to retain possession of one single piece of our soil. "The fitting moment has arrived, and we have successfully attacked our inexorable foe. It is true, that we stand alone; but God is with those who have faith in him. Islam requires no foreign aid, and if during three or four years we refrained from assisting our brethren when they fought against the Russians, it ws solely bscause it is displeasing to God that Infidels should come to the assitauce of Islam. Children of Islam! Let us show to the world that the faithful need no aid when they do battle against the onemnies of God, of his Prophet, and of our holy religirn." As is seen, Schamyl mak-es his religious principles an excuse for his inactivity duringr the war; but it is a notorious fact that he concluded an armistice with Russia on very advantageous conditions until April e st, 1857. Tt is said that 2,000 Russian deserters fought under Schamyl's flag on the banks of the Koyso, which river I have not been aole to find on Professor Koch's great map of the Caucasus. The preparations made by Prince Batthyanyi, at Kormend, for the reception of the Emperor, are said to have been extremely grand. A "banderium" of 400 horsemen, fully equipped at the expense of the Prince, escorted His Majesty from the boundary of the parish of KErmend to the castle, the magaificent hall of which was filled with exotic plants and flowers. The State apartments were hung with cloth of gold, on many parts of which were worked the Imperiel arms. In the principal soloon was a purple velvet canopy, under which were the full-length portraits of their Majesties. After dinner the inhabitants of KErmend had a feast in the park, and the Emperor appeared to take unusual interest in what was going on. There were three large basins or reservoirs filled with wine, and it is said that 3,000 large pitchers of the enlivening juice were served out to the people. The cries of "Bigen" were so loud, frequent, and prolonged that the monarch must have quitted Eoirmend with the impression that he had no more loyal suojects than the inhabitants of that place. As this is His Majesty's birthday, T'e Dleum has been sung in the cathedral, and salates have been fired from the ramparts. As the morning was showery, it is to be supposed that the projected grand parade did not take place. For the benefit of travellers in Northern Germany it may be mentioned that there are many forged 25-dollar notes of the Prussian Bank in circulationThe falsifications have the number 61,494 on them. fITALY. T-he Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and the Archduchess Charlotte left Trieste for Venice on the morning of the 16th, amid the warmest display of good feeling on the part of the population. During their stay at Trieste several grand balls were given in their honour, and one by Baron de Mertens, the Governor, was particularly brlliant. They arrived at Venice at 5 o'clock the same evening, and wore well received. The Duchess of Parma and the Duke of Modena are also there. SPAIN. The Spanish journals of the 16th have arrived; the principal point of intelligence in them being the details of the reception at St. Petersburg by the Emperor Alexander of x Isturitz, the Spanish Ambassador. Everything appears to have passed in the ordinary manner on such occasions; the Emperor, however, it is stated, having testified unumal interest in the health of the Queen, probably owing to Her Majesty's present interesting situation. A letter from Melilla of the 7th speaks of the arrival there of a Moorish chieftain, named Ml!uley Chnmagi, accompanied by a suite of between 600 and 700 men. He had been making an excursion In the interior of Fez, and was then returning home. He travelled by easy stages, ane everywhere expected to receive presents from the inhabitants. As his train was large, he had succeeded in amassing a considerable booty. On his encamping in front of Melilla, the Governor sent him a present of fruit and flowers. The chief purchaed in the town a quantity of cloth to make dresses for hi3 men, and his attendants behaved with great propriety in the place. The Governor, at the chief's request, accorded him a passport.

AMERICA. - ----- o [A summary of the following, received by electric tele. graph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday :-] LIVERPOOL, TRuxaSDAY MoiRuN. The Liverpool, Philadelphia, and New York Steamahip Company's screw steamer Kangaroo has arrived from New York, with one day's later advices 150 passengers, and $51,000 in specie. The screw steamship New York, of Glasgow, had arrived at Now York Advices from the Washington correspondent of the New York Herald state that the New Granadian difficulty has been virtually settled. No difficulty was anticipated between Spain and MelLco. The Spanish Minister had called and delivered to General Cass a draught on Havannah for $35,000, with which to pay the interest on the Spanish debt in New York. The St. Louis Democrat reports that Governor Walker was still encamped at Lawrence. His force had been increased. The legislative apportionment gave 10 members to 50 counties, and 42 members to 17 counties. A collision had occurred on the St. Lawrence between the steamboats Quebec and Montmorency; the latter was sunk, but no lives were lost. The dissolution of the Tehuantepec Company had been announced at New Orleans. The coast of New Brunswick had experienced a disastrous gale, which caused great loss of life and destruction among the fishingaboats. The money-market was without change, but in anticipation of the coming faU trade the tendency of the rates of discount was upwards. The stockmarket was inactive and more depressed, and there was no indication of an improvement. At the first board Missouri Sixes were active at former rates. Virginia Sixes improved Ji; Panama improvedI ; New York Celitral declined 1§; Erie, J; Reading, 1*; MichiganSouthern, 4; Preferred Stock-, 1; Cleveland and Toledo, 1; Illinois Central, and Chicago and Rock Island were firm at former rates. Milwaukie and Mississippi advanced ;, Galena and Chicago declined 4, La Crosse declined i, with sales of 1,000; Seares, Cleveland, and Pittsburg advanced J. At the second board the sales were small and princi- ualy on time. Erie declined J, Michigan Southern La Crosse advanced J, with an active demand. ncotton an advance of lc. had been establiabed, some parties looking upon the advices per Persia as unexpectedly favourable. The sales were moderate. Flour firm for medium and common grades of State and Western, with a fine businems in parcels; high grades heavy, and prices drooping. Arrivals of Southern freer, and outside quotations reduced. Wheat steady and quiet. Corn with light receipts firmer, Westernimied closing firm at 87hc. to88c. Southern yellow offered from store declined at 95c. (LATsr ERom THE SOUTH BY TELEGRAPH TO NEw YORK,) NEW ORLEANS, AuG. 5. Cotton unchanged. Sales to-day, 350 bales; receipts, 120.

SOUTHAMPTON, TaUPTiDAY EvzxyfG. The United States' mail steamship Ariel, Captain Ludlow, has arrived at Cowes, with advices from New York to the 8th inst., being three days later. She brings 25 passengers for Southampton, 29 for Havre, and 22 for Bremen. On freight $175,000 for London, $123,310 for Havre, and $11,940 for Bremen. The screw steamer Argo, from Southampton, arrived at New York on the 7th. On the Bar at New York the Ariel passed the Hamburg ship Oglethorpe, bound in. On the 9th inst., at 3.30 p.m., 270 miles east of Sandy Hook, exchanged signals with the steamship Fulton, and on the 14th, in lat. 48 11 N., long. 43 2 W., passed the British brig Greyhound, of St. John's, bound west. The ateamer Ericsson, from Liverpool, arrived at New York on the 6th inst. There is very little news by this arrival. Advices from Washington state that Colonel Alexander's company, consisting of 900 men and- 9<) waggons, were e n route for TTtah. A letter fronm Marion County, Florida, says thecorn crop there was good. Cotton was promising, but there had been a deluge of rain for several weeks, which would do considerable damage if it continued. The Newo York Herald of the 8th says that the despatches received that morning indicate that in the recent elections in North Carolina and Texas the Democrats have swept everything before them. A Spanish journal, publi,hed at New Orleans, states that on the departare of the steamship Texas from Vera Cruz rnmours were in circulation there that ex-President Santa Anna was dead, but there was no confirmation. A despatch of the 7th from Washington states that Mr. President Buchanan intended leaving Bedford Springs for Washington on the following Monday, and his health and spirits were buoyant. Dsspatches from Governor Walker report everything quiet between conflicting interests, and he apprehends no difflculty in the future, but deems the continuance of United States' troops necessary for the present. The Kan.mas Rerald of Freedom of the 3d inst. s'ates that Governor Walker had received advices from the Commandant of Fort Riley, that a large force of Cheyenne Indians had reached that station, and that an attack was hourly expected. The fort has no fortifications, and is garrisoned by only half a company of infantry. The Indians had driven in the settlers, and committed several murders in sight of the fort. General Walker immediately sent Colonel Cook, with all the force under his command, to their assistance. The question as to who was the bravest son of New York in the Mexican war has been definitively settled by the Committee of the CommonCouncil bestowing General Jackson's gold box upon Lieutenant-Colonel Garrett W. Dyckman, of the 1st Regiment New York Volunteers. At New York, on the 7th inst. the stockmarket was very irregular at the opening; while some railroad stocks improved others declined. There was an active business in the speculative class of securities, but the transactions were almost entirely on time. At the first board New York Central Railway advanced J per cent.; Erie, A; Reading, i; Mlichigan Southern Deferred, 2; Galena and Chicago, T; La Croese and Milwaukie, 1; Cleveland and Pittsburgh, A. Cleveland and Toledo declined J per cent.; Chicago and Rock Island, i; Panama, i; Milwankie ana Mississippi, 1. Erie opened at 33, and closed at 34i per cent. At the second board the market was active, and in several instances better prices were realized. La Crosse and Milwaukie Land Grants Bonds sold at 52i per cent., which is an advance of 84 per cent. on the previous sales; New York Uentral improved i per cent. ; Michigan Southern, Old, 1; Mlilwaukie and Misissippi, 3; La Crosme and Milwaukie, i; Cleveland and Toledo fell off jper cent.; Erie, i; Reading J. The sales of cotton on the 7th embraced about 2,000 bales; closing quite firm for all grades, and at 4c. per lb. advance for middling New Orleans. We now quote middling TJp lands at 154c., and middling New Orleans (which is scarce) at 152c. A lot of 900 bales of middling Mobile sol*d at Io6. Flour was in light stock and receipts, while sales were to a firm extent, and prices generally firm. 'Wheat was in fair demand, with Bales of new Tenessee, red, at $1 70c. to $1 75c., and white Canadian at $1 85C. Corn was firm, with moderate sales of Western mixed at 88c. to 88ic. Pork was firm, with sales in lots of mess at $24 30c. to $24 35c., and at $26 for clear. Beef continued in good demand and firm, with sales of plain and extra Chicago. Repacked and mess at $18 to $19. Sugars were firm, with sales of 1,600 to 1,800 hhds. Coffee was steady, with moderate transactions.

THE INTDIAN MUTINIES The following letter was written by Captain T. Carey, 17th Bengal Native Infantry, to a brother In the Civil Service:- " MYNPORE, vUN 2. "Thank God I am at this moment alive and well, and tm able to write and tell you so, for lat night we buried in the churchyard here my three poor companions, who were umtblessly murdered by the Sowars we were taking with nvs to assist in suppressing the mutinous spirit rising in these districts. I wrote to you from Camp Gosanjunja three or four days ago. On our arrival at Bowgons about 1alf-past 7 p.m. on Saturday, Hayes determined upon canm tering into Mynpore, about eight miles, to consult with ths :magistrate aboat attacking the Elab Rajab, who had set himself up as king, ani set our sue at defiance. All SundaY we remained at bynpore, sending poor Barber, the Adjutant of the 2d Irregulat Cavalry, directions to proceed up to Kurrowlee and that there we would join him on Monday 2norning. The Thanadar came in from Bowgous, saying our mnen were mutinying, and begged us not to trust them; but ,when Eayes's esoort came in in the evening, and said their 2nen had been complaining about the long marches, &o., -we thought it was nothing. Well, we cantered along, all mnerrily, in the moruing, talking of how we would open the road to Allyghr, and carry all before us, and after 2iding abtout 11 miles we came ap in sight of the men apparently going along the road and quite orderly. They were on one road, we on another. I said, 'Let us crs the plain and meet them.' As we approached they faced towards us and halted, and 'whei 'we had cantered up to within about 50 yards of them one or two of the native officers rode out to meet us, and said in a low volce, ' Fly, Sahibs, fly.' Upon this poor Hayes said to me as 'we wheled round our horses, ' Well, we must now fly for our lives,' and away we went with the two troops after us like demons, yelling and 6anding the bullets from their carbines flying el1 round us. Thank God neither I nor my horse was hit. Hayes was riding on the side nmearest the troopers, and before we had gone many yards I saw a native officer go up alongside of blm, an i with one blow cot him from his saddie. It was the work o' xmn instant, and took much less time than I have to relat t It. On they all came shouting after me, and every now and then "ping' came a ball near me. Indeed, I thought my amoments were numubered, but as I neared the road at the end of the maidan a ditch presented itself. It 'was but ai moment I thought, dug my spurs hard in, and the mare :flew over it, though she nearly fell on the other side; for*uuately, I recovered her, and in another moment I was leaving all behind but two Sowars, who followed me and poor Hayes's horse teai,-ng on after me. On seeing this I put my pistol into my holster, having reserved my fire until a man 'was actually upon me, and took a pull at the mare, as I had still a long ride for it, and knew my riding mvau tow staud me a good turn; so I raised the mare as much as I could, keeping- those fiends about 100 yards in rear, and they, Isuppose,seeingl 'was takingit easy, and not urging my horse, but merely turning round everynowand thento watch them, pulled up, after ehasing me two good miles Never did I know a bappler moment,and most fervently did I thank God for saving my life. Eayes's Arab came dashing aloug, and passed me; I stil continued to ride on at a strong -,pace, fearful of being taken and murdered by some 'who had taken ashort out unknown to me. Thus up to thesixth mil3 from home did I continue to fly, when, finding my miare completely done, and meeting one of our Sow7as, I immediately stopped him, jumped upbehind, and ordered .him to haste back to Mynpore. After going about a mile en this beast we came up to poor Hayes's horse, which bad been caught, so ori him I sprang, and he bore me beck safely toccantonments. It was, indeed, a ride for li.feor death, send only when 1 alighted at the magistrate's kutcherry, in which all the Europeans were assembled, did I feel at all cowfortable. Men were immediately sEnt out to look for the body (Hayes'r) and bring it In, and ascertain tbe late of Barker, the adjutant, and young Fayeer, Mho were known to have left their last encam-ning ground with the men. In the afternoon poor Baypes' body was brought in, his head most frightfilly hacked about, his right hand cut off, and his left fearfully %aerated-his watch, rings, boots, all gone, and his clothes .allcut and torn to pieces. Poor fellow! it'was a sad fate -for such a good and clever man, and deeply do I feel the- "s of one 'who 'was ever a kind fLiend to me, anxious to berve me 'by every means in hIs power; gladly 'would I have assisted him had I had it 4^n my power, but what. could I do against 200 infuriated fanaticl Poor Bayes was not eight Yards from me 'when he fell, and one instant's delay would have been oertain death to me. One old Sikh Birdar with two followers, 'who stood. a.oof from these acts of murder, and one of BHyes's servants brought in his body, and from them I leed that poor .young Fayeer's and Barber's remains ere also bing IDrought in. A dastardly villain of a Sowar stole behind poor young Fayeers, as he WSas drinking at 'well, and 'with one blow of his tulwar in his neck killed him; he feUlbacks his,head balf severed from his body. The old Sikh rushed forward to raise bim, and ordered them to seire the omr. derer, when another man said, ' What I are you with these Caffres; take care of yourself' On raisng poor young Fayeer's head the poor man breathed his last. Barber 9led up the road, several giving chase ; he shot one horse, and t,wo of the So wars,'when he was hit 'with a ball and then cut miown,his property takenoff.his horseseized,andthenthey all rode off towards DelhL Fayeer 'was killed about l0minutes before we came up, then they killed Poor Hayes, and then Barber. Thus you see, through the mercy of God, I escaped sharing these poor fellows' fate, I Li nowv with some eight others in the Kutcherry of Mynpore; we have lots of ar,ns and ammunition. It is a large pukha building, and from the top we can malce a good fight if no guns are brought against us. We have 100 of the Gwalior Horse, under Major :Raikes, and are raising infantry and cavalry all round, and mow have about 100 of each or more, besides a few men of the th NativeInfantry 'who remained true to their salt, and did not desert with the rest. The Gwalior Horse h1njor likes seems vary confident in, hut since this last e6veute in our men I do not place trut in a single native. Deeply do I feel for my unforlnnate Companions 'who left Cawnpore with me, full of hope, and anxious to be the first to cut our way through this Etabh Rajalh's country, and open the road for Government to Allygurb, which has now been closed some days. We were all anxious to distinguish ourselves, and every day we tried to inspire our men, %who swore they would follow us, and thus, with a deceitful, lying outward show of entering heartily into our views, did they lead us on, and then became the murderers of those poor men who had neveT injured them, and promised them all sorts of rewards if they would fight well and stick to our sides like cen. Thus is our dream dispelled. I, the only one left of those four; it is sickening to contemplate," The following letter is from a gentleman in the Civil Service whom the news of tho revolt surprised at Simla: " MEERUT, JuNx 21. " I last wrote from Simla on the 7th, 'rhich place I had reached in six days by double marches from Nuggur. I gnt down to Uniballah in 23 hours. We found the Umr b.alab people as if in a state of siege, three companies o' Europeans in the church, and guns and mud bAtterle' around it. We witnessed the same day (the 5th of Jbe) the hanging of the Subalader, Jemadar, and Pay Havildar of the 5th Native Infantry for concealment of mutiny, They were hanged in fronttof their men; andaitis'well the latter, tho'ugh only 150 were present, had been previously disarmed. At Kurnaul, the next day, we found onlY Le Bap, of the Civil Service, and Martinean, of the 10th Ia'7tive Infantry, who had very pluckily taken on them selves to act respectively a collector and commnIsat officer there, though unsupported by any Europeans We *were joined by Butler, of the 2d Europeans, and TUlloh, of the 20t Native Infantry, at Kuaul, 'who accompanied uss to Delhi. The latter has ince lost the calf ot his leg by a round shot. We fonud that a hard fight had talcen place on the 8th, and a sortie in force on the 9th. The bodies of about 15o black scoundrels 'were lying about Badleeke Serai on the road close to the ounp. They 'were enormously swollen by the heat, and the stench was very bad. I reported myself to Mr. Greathed, Co mmissioner, and communicated to him the first news of tbe mrutinies of Jullundur and Phil. lour. G- told me he thought it my duty to join my appointment at Meerut directly, but that a report had juit come in that the Bareilly mutineers were encamped near )learut, and be had no escort to offer me except five of my own cutohery Sowars (mounted messengers, useless for fighting). I watched tbe shell and other praotio0 during the day. There is no 'want of ablity and energy in the lower grades of the army. Daly, of the Guides corps, Hodson, of the Fusileers, and Wilson, briga. dier of artillery, are heroes, at present invaluable to the State. An alarm of an attaok in our reer sounded at 11 p.m., and 'when it subsided I mounted on a Sowar's borse, and, with five Sowars acompanying me, sarted on my 60-mile ride for Meerut. I reached the Meerua initrenobments the next night, having providentially found all quiet on the road, and next day took chage of the district, 'which is nearly disorganirzed owing to large 1hands of Goorjurs and Jhats, who are murdering and plan. dering in every direction. Our communications are cut ofil except towards Delhi and Mussoorie. I wear frequently f;om H- B-, wbo throughout has stood firm at his F,st with his immediate superior, Mr. B-, magistrate of Saharampore. Indecd, nothing could be better than the qedduct of the entire civil service; many have devotedly sacrificed their lives at out-of-the-way stations, deterrmineI to try and keep order aslongas they lived. Poor J. W. amd his young wife were killed at Hissar, he thinking it his duty cotto leave his post, though he had heard long before o' the massacres going on throughout the country. Martia' law prevails in these districts, and we have to hang some men nearly every day. Some of the worst villages of plun. derers are burnt, and the generality of the male iahabitant; killed in our 'tours.' One of the pensioners of our Govern ment, by name WaUee Dud Khan, 'aas seized the distriot of Bolundshuhur, the Sepoys there having mutinied and plun. dered the treasury. He has received tbe appointment of Subahdarof Meertt from the King of Delhi, and, having mounted six guns on his fort of Malagruh, and raised a rabble force of some thousands of Gooriurs, has advanced to Galowtee, on the road to this place. Galowtee is about 3) miles from this, but we beard he intended to atitak the city of laupper, which Is ten mies nearer than Gowtee. A squadron of Oarabineers, 40 Bidee two HorseArtillery gauns, and about 60 native Sowars, were therefore told off to attaok him. I accompanied the force with all the young civilians atpresent here-viz, Turnhb.,l Sapte, Cliford, Melville and Lyall. We started at 6 p.m., rested two hours at Haupper, and went on to Galowkee. We heard that tbs Goorjur followers of Wallee Dud Ahan and his Genera. Ismail Khau, had had a grand quarrel with the Jhats of thv neighbourhood, wbo were ready to ssi§t us. On our ap proachmg Galowtee we found that the enemy had fled, an i although we pured the rear guard acroce eountry for about six miles we could not catch men on fresh horses, but killed a few footmen; we then set the vilkSe of Burmat pore on fire; this brought together a number of Jhats in ths hopes of plunder, and to assist us against the Goorjura An officer of Carabineers and a number of bis men were just charging in among the asts, and would have cot up a number of them, if I had not fortunately ridden up at the time and atopped them. We then set on the Thatg, who buant and plundered si G6o2jur villages, killing 17 men and losimg two of their wn 'bum. ber. It must be remeumbered that the Gooriurs ae hem ditay robbars, and the grand trrsk road. opposte, to- their villages has, since the mutiny, ben eonstantly atana3dt wi the blood of the travellers and otheas they nurderedt. We retorned to Hlaupper by 12 at neen, having beemin- the saddle for about 16 hours and gone 5WAiles. Two of tileneme of the Carabineers got sunstroke, and three horses dlebdo fatigue; one of the Rifles had his fbot injured by&a gsun wheel going over it, but 'we had no othe-rcanualties onoursidt The wnole of the Rohilound mutineerare now crosing.ptheGanges at Gurhmucktese, and I bave done my best to inudto the General here to let a small party with two guns go out to meet them; but as they hsave eight gum and 2,000 reg-a1r troops, besdes rabble, and we could not b.ig more thab 303 Buropeans and four guns aganst them, the proposal W. negatived at a oouncil of war. The whole of the counett appeared to be against my proposal of attacting the enemy at the Gbat, yet I am fully oonvinced that time wiU prove I was right, and the decision of the council &enistake. The Robilcund men will probably go on to Deiht. The 23d o' this month is the 100th anniversary of the baitle of Plassey. The natives sayourgovernmentwill ceasn'on thatday.

If they don't give us a medal when this is over I will never sPeak to a Director again ! . . . . . The rains ar. coming on in a day or two, by all appearance. I hope the men won't get ill in tents." The following letter is from a lady, dated. Agra, June 27 " . . . I will now try to describe all this as it happened. A rising had long been expected at Gwa'lor; bat, alas, nothing was done, and we had no English troops. Oa Sunday, the 14th of June, just as we were going to bed about half-past 9, our servants rushed in and said tha Sepoys had risen. We dressed as quickly as we could, sn i then walked to an officer's bungalow to learn what we could do to escape. We found the family inaa state of great Plam ; as we were talking to Mrs. -, her husband's horse rushed by, and they said he had just been shot. We then went and hid ia the garden under some trees for about three hours; the shot was flying round us in all directions, and the houses were burning. The servants then hid us-tbat is my husband, Mrs.-, and myselfin one of their housea Here we lay hid some time, expecting every moment to ba discovered and dragged out. The Sepoys came in once or twice, bat did not see us; at last about 5 o'clock in tha morning they found us. They were afraid to come in at the door, so they pulled the roof off and fired in upoa us. We then went to the door and begged them not to kill us. When my husband went to the door they fired twice at him. There were about 20 of thesa horrld-looking men, and quite drunk. He was not 'wounded and rushed on, they pursuing him and fired "a him as he ran. I then rushed forward too, and at first tbey fired at me as wel, but then they dragged me away. I uever saw - after this; but I have sinc he rd that he waskciled two or three compounds further on. I got an offioer here who escaped to make all the inqvuries he could. It is not known if the bodies were burled or not, but it i believed they were all thrown into the river. I amnsarey write or think, so fearful is it al " After I suppose they had killed-the Sepoys canme back to us; they puihed all the ladie into a little hut that was near, and then they all crowded in nd mocked at us, and threatened us witb death, wore thaa death, They then took- us to the lines. After keeping as there some timo they said they would not kil us, a we 'wer only womDn, and they had kllled our husbands, and so they crammed about six ladies into a carriage and sent us away. I cannot tell you the misery of the five days it took us to reach Agr, Our lives were in danger the whole time, both from villagers and from parties of Sepoys we fell in with. They held loaded pistols and naked swords over us again and again. Oumr paLty altogether consisted of eight ladies, besides four sergeant' wives and a number of children. We had nothing but grin to eat and water to drink, One sergeant's Wif died on the way from a sunstroke. We had no covering to our heads, and some had no shoes. The Sepoys had robbed us of everything; they even took the ladies' weddlng-rings. I tied mine round my waist, and so have kept it. At last :ze reahed here. I am staying with the Political Agent, as I have no friend here. My miseries sare almost more than I Can bear. On the first anniversary of our wedding-day I heard for certain of -'a death. Even here we feel far from safe. We sleep in our clothes at the barracks; ana every night wo expect an attack. There is only one English regiment here; and in the gaol there are 3,000 of the 'worst charaoters." The following are extracts from a letter from the Rev. James Kennedy, of Benares. The letter is dated June 29, 1857: " We have had many ups and downs since I wrote last; but thanks to the Divine goodness we are still in safety, end though it is well nigh impossible to have a feeling o° security, we think our position is daily Improving. The country in the immediate neighbourhood is settlipg dnwa into quietness. For several d.ys, so far aS wo know, the e has been no plandering or mur dering -within several wUs. of our oity. For this comparative imp unity, s7hen the greate6e part of the country is in a blaze, we are indebted unde God to s3everal things. 1. We have no native soldiers worth naming to keep us in dread, while we have a very considerable body of European troops, to whom daily additions arad made. Not a day psses without several arriving. The7 are being constantly posted on, and yet we J've from 600 t ' 700 always here, with six large guns. Thb dread of th European soldiers has fallen remarkably on the people since the engagement on June 4. They think them demons i i human forms, and to this opinion our safety is in a degree traceable. 2. We have an officer in command o the station of great visour, in whom all have con fidence. 3. Oar judge is a man greaUy feared by th, people, and during this crisis he has done most exceje i service. For daring. vigour he has few equals; his name is a proverb for swift, stern jastice. Thar are of ourse thousands in this city set on mciscief; and iae dread of this one man han done more to keep th m. quiet than anything else. The result is that the city, nzt. wlthetaa&ing its well-known turb,ece in even peacefu times, remainm astonishingly qulet. Many of the peopl ame petrifliet rith fear of our soldiers being let loose o , them. Oarukad magistrate also is woel spoken of by tieI I eommunity. 4. The gibbet Is, I must aehnowledge, a stand.

fONBIY-§MABRBTand CIT YIN TELLIGENCB. Thursday Evening. The funds opened this morning at the slight reduction which occurred just before the close of business yesterday, and subsequently showed increased dullness. The first transactions iu Consols for money were at 91i to i, bat a decline took place almost immediately to 91 to J. They then exhibited steadiness until late in the day, when a sale by the broker for tbe Court of Chancery caused the market to become weak, and they touched 90k. Ultimately there was a partial reaction, and the closing quotations were 91 to J for money, and 91k to j for the 9th of September. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 21i ; Reduced, 91a to i; New Three per Cents. 91l to J; India Stock, 211 to 213; India Bonds, 22s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. There was an increased amount of money in the Stock-Exchange to-day for employment in loans on Government securities, and the rate was between 3i and 4 per cent. The discoiint-market was without alteration, the supply being still adequate at a fraction below the Bank miitimum. In the foreign etock-market a moderate amount of business has been transacted, generally at former prices. Turkish, however, was heavy, and closed at a decline. Danish Tbree per Cents. were negotiated at S5. ; Mexican, foz the account, 22k Russian Five per Cents., 112i ; Sardinian, 89i, #, and Ji; Spanisb, for the account, 40; ditto, New Deferred, for the aecount, 25g ; ditto Certificates, 6 and 6i; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 94R and 1: and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99j and s; The closing quotations from the Paris Bourse failed to arrive this evening. The Bank of Prussia have to-day raised their rate of discount from 5 to 5a per cent. Looking at the faet that about a fortnight back a rise was adopted also by the Bank of Holland. and that the returns of the Bank of France have lately shown that that establishment has suffered the penalty of a heavy drain from not having pursued a similar course, it is evident that any relaxation on this side would be altogether premature. At Hamburg discount is still considerably above the London rate, and at Vienna the duli state of the stock-market denotes a tendency to increasing pressure. It is also to be borne in mind that if the Austrian Government propose to carry out their plan of resuming specie payments on the 1st of January next, it will be necessary for them to provide an addition of at least two or three millions sterling to the stock held by the National Bank. To do this they may possibly resort to a loan, and it has already been surmised that some negotiations are in progress for obtaining it in the London market. That opinion may be without foundation, but, whether the amount be raised here or in Vienna, the operation cannot fail to exercise some influence in checking the approach to an easier state. With regard to prospects in Paris, all that can be said is that the principal houses continue day by day to write that better times are at hand, and that with equal pertinacity the quotations on the Bourse contradict all their anticipations. The monetary condition of France at this moment is obviously analogous to that which followed the railway mania in England, and when it is considered that the prevailing difficulties have not even been arrested by the most magnificent harvest ever gathered, it is easy to conceive what must have been the Jeopardy when that point was in uncertainty. The people employed on railways and other public works are largely consuming imported goods; and, as there is no prospect of these works being suddenly stopped or lesseened, it is probable a considerable time must yet elapse before the trade of the country will return to its natural balance. The Jura to-day has brought the 40,0001. of gold remitted by the last Australian steamer. Half of the amount is in sovereigns, which wil probably be taken to the Bank, while the remainder will be sent to the continent. The Kangaroo, from New York, has brought 10,0001. The rumour lately circulated of a merchant at Liverpool having died suddenly, leaving liabilities for 30),0001., of which 100,0001. had been found to be forgeries, appears to have been an exaggeration compounded from two incidents. A sharebroker in extensive business was found dead in his bed, as it now appears, from disease of the heart, on the morning of the ast settling day, when he had to pay large differences, and it has since been ascertained that he has left his affairs in a very unsatisfactory state. A few days previously a partner in a respectable mercantile firm disappeared, having, it is said, forged acceptances for 25,0001. In both cases the details are kept private, and, as is usual under such circumstances, they have created needless excitement and alarm. The foUowing relates to the cotton producing capacity of Mexico, a question which has lately awakened much interest, both politically and commercially, among the persons connected with that country. All the statements of the writer with regard to the qualities of the soil and climate coincide with the testimony of other correspondents, and are probably not overdrawn; but his assumption that nothingis wanting but British capital to cause the produotion to become ample and profitable cannot be assented to. Good laws, good roads, and efficient protection for life and property must precede the development of this or any other kind of industry. Perhaps the day is not distant when a resuscitation of Mexico may be witnessed. The present Government, although opposed at all points by the ecclesi stical power, have done much in that direction, and should their efforts fail the Republic is evidently destined to fal to the away of its neighbours, who will perhaps produce an alteration with as much rapidity as in California. Meanwhile it is unnecessary to say that our capitalists can hardly exercise too much caution, whatever may be the invitations given to them in this direction " Sir,-The following is the translation of an extract from the letter of a wealthy and inflaential gentleman of the city of Puebla, who, with many of the gentlemen farming their own estates, is anxious to meet with the co-operation of the Cotton Supply Association of Manchester, or of others of the manufacturing intereets for their assistance in the cultivation, export, and market of cotton to be grown in Mexico:- Do me the favour to interest yourself that the English people may torn their attention to the cultvationi of the cotton plant in exico-a want so much felt by the manufacturing interest in England. In no other country of the vorld, wil they be able to obtinl it so readily both in quality and abnndance, and att so small a cost as can he oh. tained here. You well know the resources of this country and its extent of cultivated soil in the warmer temperatures near the cities of Mexico and Puebla ; from Atlixco (21 miles from Paebla to the coast) cotton can be caltivated at a high remuneration; the same in the counties oE Oaxaca, Vallodolid, Guadalajara, &c. What we require are moneyed and intelligent men, to direct the operations, as the afexicans are docile and laborious, so that one or two able men wvell acquainted with the management of the plant would suffice to the proper direction on each estate. I can offer many thousand acres-land proper for the growth of the cotton plant in the counties of Mexico and Puebla. " ' Several farmers are anxious to embark their money and ]nd in the undertaking, but they desire the co-operation of the English buyers to insure the export and open a steady rnarket for the produce. I asure you I wiU remove any obstacle if yo assist ine in effecting the arrangement of this matter wit the manufacturing interest of England. c.

COURT of BAfNKBUPTUY, Ba&inghaU-strclt Aug. 20. m! RE THlE VEISE POTOSI LEAD A.'D COPPIR G COMPA1XY-" LINTITRn-" (Before Mr. Oommiesionor FA£x.) This Vas a meeting to settle the list of contributors. Mr. Harrison appeared as solicitor under the proceedings, and Mr. Plews for a contributory. Preparatory to entering on the legitimate business of the day the Court was enlivened by a narration of the manner in which some of the London press-cbiefly of the penny family-had published some of the principal names of the contributories prior to their names having been actually "settled." An application was nmade that the proceedings on the present occasion might be taken in private, in order to prevent a repetition of a like occurrence, which wras attended with many evils, The ConMInsaroNan'. said that the document filed in court from which the said information was obtained ought not to have been made use of. Mr. HARItSoN.-It is due to The Times to state that while it mentioned the fact of a list of contributories having been filed it abstained from giving the names, on the ground that such publication would bo premature. Mr. PLEWS urged that the irregular papers-"the penniee"-were the chief delinquents. The ComiissIoMNEE thought that the best mode of coun. tera&ting the transgressors-namely, the penny papers would be to strtotly enforce the rules of the Court, which imposed the payment of Is. by any person wishing to inspect the proceedings of the Court. Such a payment would be a formidable obstaole to the class of papers referred to. (Litughter.) Mr. PLEwS.-On the part of the shareholders, whom I represent, it will be my duty, when the list of contribu+onies has been settled, to ask for an investigation into the circumstances under which, out of 20,0 0 shares advertised as being issued, only 13,000 appear on the list. We wish to know what has become of the other 7,000 shares; so, wby the parties ventured to commnence business and to spend 20,000L or 30,0001. without having the proper amount of capital paid up. The CommissioNE-Is it required by the law of jointstock companies that business shall not be commenced vithout every one of the shares being paid up? 'Mr. PLvAVS.-Tn the prospectus it is stated that the capital shall be 100,0001., divided into 20,000 shares. he ComiussioNm-Then, you contend that it would be inconsistent with the prospectus to commence with a capital of 99,999. ? Mr. 'LEWvS.-Not only inconsistent with the prospectus. I also refer to the deed of settlement. This is a company established on what is called "1 the costbook prineiple." Upon that principle the purser of the company is required to lay before the shareholders at the commencement of each month an estimate of the cost of working the company for the ensuing month, and that amount is then to be pro. vided. The ComissIoNiEs-It is on the ready money system, then? Mr. PIxws.-Yes, that is the true principle of the costbook system. That principle has been wholly disregarded in this case, and the shareholders have been acrificed most frightfully. I shall ask your Honour (for you have the power to do it) to throw the consequences of this mismanagement on those who have been the authors of it. The CossIssIONsE.-Very well; that will be a matter for future consideration. At present the best course is sor all the parties interested to go into a private room and arrange the list of contributories. The arrangement of the list was then discassed in private. IN RE THE HASTINGS OLD BANK. Mr. BAGL, on behalf of the separate creditors of Francis Smith, one of the partners in the bank, applied for the appointment of an insp.ector, with authority to look into the proceedings of the assignees, on the ground that the.in. terests of the separate creditors were antagonistic to those of the joint estate. Having heard Mr. Doria (eor&), his Honour sanctioDed the appointment of an inspector.

CENYTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, Aug. 20. OLD COURT. Isejore Air. Barons AItATrI.) John Payne, 19, whopresented the appearancs of a person of weak inte,lect, was indicted for the wilful mumder of Ricabod Empon. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Clerk conducted the prosecutionMr. Giffard defended the prisoner. The learned counsel for the prosecution, in opening the case to the jury, said there could not be the least doubt that the deceased met his death at the hands of the prisoner, and the only question for their consideration would be whether the prisoner was in such a state of mind at the time as to render him responsible; and it appeared to him that the evidence for the prosecution would satisfy them that the prisoner committed the aet under the delusion that the deceased intended to kill him, and that he was not in his right mind, and was consequently not responsible. He then proceeded to state that the prisoner ap. peared to have come out of gaol on the 7th of July, and a day or two afterwards he was taken u on aome other charge, and the magistrate before whom he was examined felt it to be his duty, from bis conduct and appearance, to send him to St. Martin's Workhouse, where it was found necessary to place him under restraint in one of the wards; and the deceased, who was an old man, 70 years of age, wa.s directed by the master of the workhouse to watch him. A strait waistcoat had been placed upon the prisoner and he was strapped down in the bed; bat it appeared that about 5 o'clock in the morning of the 1lth of July the prisoner succeeded in freeing himself from the strap b which he bad been confined and immediately commenceuan. attack upon the deceased with a broken poker, which he must have secreted about his person from the previous day, and beat him so dreadfully about the head that be d.d in an hour or two afterwards. The prisoner after the occurrence was very violent, and the police were sent for, and when he was secured he said that he had killed the deceased, and if he had not done so he would have killed him. Mr. Grainger, the medical offlicer of the workhouse, who it appeared saw the prisoner upon his admission, and after the act bad been committed, expressed his opinion that he was insane, and that he had destroyed the deceased under the delusion that had been mentioned. Baron MARTvsc, after the evidence for the prosecution lad been given, said he thought the jury would consider it unnecessary to hear the counsel for the defence, as the prisoner appeared to be clearly proved to have been insane and to have committed the act under a delusion. The jury said they considered it unnecessary, and at once Acquitted the prisoner on the ground of insanity. The learned JUDGE gave directions that he should be kept in strict oustody during Her hiajesty's pleasure. Mr. MTcALFxca elled the attention of tke Court to the charge of manslaughter against the engine driver, stoker, and signalman upon the North Kent Railway, and said that Serieant Ballantine and Serjeaxt Parry were specidally retained for the defence, and that the first-named learned gentleman would certainly not be able to attend at the pre. sent session, and he therefore suggested that it would be advisable to postpone the trial to the next session. Mr. Baron MAsR=LY inquired whether any objection was made on the part of the prosecution to this course being taken. Mr. BODKnx said that he was instructed to prosecute, and be did not see any objection to the case being postponed. The trial was accordingly ordered to stand over, but the Court directed that the defendants should be admitted to bail upon their entering into their own recognizance in the sUru of 5oo&, and finding two sureties in 2001. each. The grand jury, who had been specially summoned to attend t mormnig to dispose of the indictment against Antonio do Salvi, the Italian, and Mr. Iower, for wounding *a person named Robertson in the Queen's Bench Prison, came into court abcout the muiddle of the day, and returned a ttrue bil against De Salfi, and a bill not found against the This result was pretty generally anticipated by those who were acquainted with the circumstances under which the charge was preferred against Mr. Gower. The only evidence against that gentleman, who has for a great many years carried on a most respectable .iasiness in the city of London, was that he was supposed to have made use of some expression of encouragement to De Salvi; and it is only due to him to state that he has aU along denied 'making use of any such expression; and the grand jury, by the mode in which they gave disposed of the bill, have, Intimated their opinion that this was the fact. In the course of the day the prisoner De Salvi was c^Died ur to plead ta the indictment that had been found against nim, and which charged him with feloniously stabbng and wounding Richard Henderson Robertson, with intent to murder him, The prisoner said he had stabbed the prosecutor, but he did not intend to kill him, and a plea of `Not Guilty" waa accordingly recorded, He was then asked whether he would exercise his' right of being tried by a jury party composed of foreigners aud partly of Englishmen. He replied that he should leave it all to his counsel, and lie was then removed from the bar. Mr. E. James, Q.C., and Mr. Serjeant Parry are specially retained to defend the prisoner. Frederick Grieves, 17, was indicted for feloniously extorting money from Matthew Gibson, under a threat of accusing him of a felonious offence. Mr. Robinson prosecuted. The prosecutor appeared to be a respectable young man in the service of a ropemaker at Stepney, and it appeared that one evening, about three months ago, he saw the prisoner in the Mile-end-road, and threatened to mnake an odious charge against him if he did not give him some -ioney. The prosecutor was alarmed, and gave the prisoner 8s., and it appeared that after this tho prizonsr constantly dogged the prcaecutor, and extorted money from him on five other occasions under the same threat. The prosecutor positively denied that there was the slightest foundation for the acousation made by the prisoner. The jury returned a verdict of Guilty, and the prisoner was sentenced to penal servitude for life. Eliza Peters, 23, was charged with feloniously attempting to set fire to the dwelling-house of William Deen, with intent to injure him. Mr. Payne prosecuted; the prisoner was defended by Kr. LIdIey. The prosecutor kept a small house in York-street, Westmninater, every room of which was let out to different lodgers, and the prisoner occupied one of the attics, and appeared to bo in very poor circumstances, A charge had been made against her of pawning some of the rticle3 of furniture belonging to her landlady, and shortly after this had occurred it appeared that there was an alarm of fire in the prisoner's room, and it was found that her bed waaon fire, but it was extinguished before any very serious injury was done. It was suggested that this fire was occasioned by the prisoner out of revenge at the charge that had been made against her, but there was very little evidence to establish the case against her. The jury returned a verdict of Not Guilty, Wiliam Goff, 23, William Jones, 23, Henry Loversae, 24, Emma Grainger, 24, and Mary Anne Clark, 24, were indicted for a robbery with violence upon George Johnson, and stealing 51. in money and a watcb, his property. The women were also charged with feloniously aiding and abetting the other prisoners in the comamission of the robbery. Mr. Metoalfe conducted the prosecntion ; Mr. Payne defended Goff; and Mr. O'Connell defended Jones. The other prisoners had no counsel, The prosecutor in this caso Is the landlord of the Salisbury Arms publichouse in Beer-street, Leicester-square, and it appeared that about 3 o'clock in the morning, four men, two of whom he positively deposed to as being Goff and Jones, came into his house, and stayed there drinking antil past 5 o'clock in the morning. They then asked him to let their reckoning remain upon the security of a watch which they offered to him. He agreed to do so, and lent them 5s., and they had more drink. The prosecutor suddenl7 missed one of the party from before the bar, and immediately afterwards he was saized from behind round the -throat; all the party attacked him, and robbed him of 61. and the watch that had been given to him. The prosecutor at length became insensible, and the men made their esoape. The prosecuitor shortly afterwards came to himself, and gave information to the police of what had occurred describing the appearance of the persons who had been concerned in the outrage that was committed upon him. The prisoners Goff and Jones were positively sworn to as being two of the party, and a constable who was on duty near the house stated that he also saw Loversage come to the door, and when the prisoner was taken into custody a few days aftervwards by Glass, a sergeant of the C division beomade a desperate resistance, and he and some thieves and bad charaeters by whom he was surrounded at the time bit and kicked tne constable very severely, before he could secure him. The only evidence against the women was that they were standing near the honse of the prosecutor, and weie seen to be in communication with the men by whom the robbery was afterwarda effected. The jury found the maale prisoners Guilly, and AcquitUd the women. Mr. Baron MAaTr, in passing sentence, said that the prisoners had been convieted of a most daring and aggrovated rob'bry, and ordered them to be kept in penal Ee-. vitude for 15 years. His Lordship, at the same time, sa:d that the constable Glass had exhibited a good deal of courage in securing the prisoner Loversage, and directed that a reward of 40s. Lbould he gi;ven to him. George Cox, 41, was charged with felonioualy wounding 'Caroline Cox, with intent to murder her. Jn a .rccond count the intent ot the prisoner was laid to be to do plievous bodily harm. Tho 'prisoner was also charged with the like offence upon 'Willlam Fortie, Mr. J. Payne prosecuted; Mr. Sleigh and Mr. O'Connell were counsel for the prisoner. ,The learned counsel for the prosecution having briefly stated the ciroumstances under which the charge was preferred, and which ware of a rather extraordinary character, the following witnesses were examined - CaroHne Cox deposed that she was the wife of the p roner, and they lid been married 22 years, but latterly they had not hved together. On the 31st of last December she met a man hamed Fortie at the theatre, and they talked together, and she saw him several times afterwards, and on the oth of MArch she weht to be his housekeeper, and remained at his house until tho 14th of July, when' she went to live in the Goswell-street-road. On the 20th of July the prisoner came to the house where she WaS staying, and asked her to give him some breakfast. She went out to go to a dispensary in Aldersgate-street, and the prisoner accompanieio her. There was no dispute between them att this time. The prisoner stood outside, aid when she came ,out dc! the dispensary she saw him speakinig to Fortie, and they aU three went to the Angel public house, and sat down on a bench there, and she had some fhaland-half and a biscuit, and Fortie paid for whLat they had. Fortie said something about her not eatint ber biscuit, and her husband said that it showed she did not respect the giver. Shortly after this the prisoner strack Fortie iin the face, and he said " If that as 'your game, Georgeor Pnoff," and left the houe, and her husband fol. 'lowvedhim; and some one said he had eot a knife. Sho tried tdtrnus away, and her husband followed her to the cornecr of St Martin's-le-Grand. where she fell down, a*id the pzisoner strick her twice with a dagger, onoe on the baok ahd one on theahouQder. She had sen thed before4 The woin bleda-gzrq%4oal an4d ow to the hospital. The prisoner knew that she was living at Fortieas house, and he talked about getting 301. from Forti and slad that he would either have money or revenge; *n3 he said that he did not want her to live with him. All he wanted was money, and if ho got it she might live with whom she liked, and he should takea girl home to lve with Cross-xamined.-Witnes was unwell, and had been so for some time. Would swear that she had not been laughing and joking with the witnesses during theafternoon. Did not know exactly what her husband caUed himself. He had something to do with the Chinese Exhibition when it was at Brighton. He had been engaged as money-taker at a theatre. She was now living at the house occupid by the prisoner at Hoxton. She had been living with Fortie three 'months before her husband knew where she had gone to. She passed as Mrs. Fortie. When Fortie's son came home he asked him how he liked his new mother-in-law. Her husband saw her during these three months, but he did not know where she was living. She believed that he tried to find out where she had gone to. Shetoldthe prisoner that sbe had left Fortie's house, but she didnotsa;yshewouldcome !rome to him at the end of the week. This was on the 14th of July. On the evening of this day her husband had an altercation with Fortie and struck him, and a policeman was caled in, but Fortie would not give him in charge, and theyafterawtrdshad some ginanandwater together. He bad repeatedly said thathoewould take Fortie's life if hie did nt giv himmoe,adt prevent him from doing injuary to Fotie se tol himthat she had seaae rom Fbortle for ever.,Her husband fist maenand thencamedow to l~,and he wished hertohvhe likeness taken to give to Fortie. She did not think she should have thought of having her likeness taken if he husbnd ha notsuggested it. Before they went to the publichouse she said to Fortle, E 't B iam, George accuses mne of hAvin beenL with you last Saturday night," and Fortiesaid he had satisfied him that this was not true. They were in the publichouse about hslfeet her.husbandy wlere walking along Alderagatestreet her husband walkedbetween her and Fortie. Fortie did not say that he would keep her in defiance of the - soner, or that he had been in the prize ring and could til1 forty such men as her husband. There was no proposition madethattheyshouldtossupforber, andthatthe winner sbould stand a sovereign and a supper. (A. laugh.) She tht hiseyehoh hainthebpunblicohpouyse,and he struck her in the face immediately. Fortie told her husband that he had had a good woman and did not know how to use her. She did not bear her husband beg Fortie to desist from using such oheervations ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~t- Baron MAprTIN.-Did they call each other " George" and "Willam I" Wituese.-Yes, my Lord. Cross-examination oontinued.-Her daughters came to see her while she was in the hospital, but they did not teli her what evidence had been given by Fortie. Re-examined.-She had nothing to do with Fortie after the 14th of July, but he gave her some money upon one occasion. Wiliam Fortie a baldheaded man, apparently between 40 and 50 years oid, was then examined, and he deposed to the same facts as thoEe spoken to by the last witness. He ,also stated that on the day in question the prisoner asked ahim if he had seen Caroline on the previous day, and he told him he had not, and the prisoner said he was satisfied. The prisoner's wife then came up, and they walked together a short distance, and he invited the prisoner to have some beer, sand they went into a pubUchouse and sat down in the parlour, and he called for a pot of beer. He afterwards called for a second pot, and the prisoner's wife vwhispered something in his ear and he struclc her immediately in the mouth and made it bleed. Witness then ran out of the lhouse aud thezprisoner folowed him and stabbed him in the arm with the dagger. Cross-examined.-Mrz. Cox lived with him as his wife for about four months. He never told the prisoner that they were married. He never took the trouble to let the prisoner know where he was living with his wife. It was not very hikeiy that he should do so. (A laugh). He had seen the prisoner several times, hut he was always very quiet until thisoccaslon. Thenmoment his wrife whispered in his ear he becamne very angry anud struck her, and then ran after him and stabbed him. Re-examined.-There was no laughing or jeering in the publichouse. Mr. F. W. Skene, one of the house surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, proved that the prosecutrix had two stabs in her back near the bladebone, but neither of them were of a dangerous character. He afterwards saw Fortie and found that there was a wound on his shoulder about tbree inches deep. All the injuries were of a character that would be inflicted by such an instrument as the dagger that was produced. pary Hll deposed that she lived in the same house as the prisoner, and on the 19th of July he said to her, " I cannot stand this about my wifo any longer." She did not mee any dagger in his possession at the time. Cross-examined.-The prisoner appeared to be in great distress and agony of mind in consequence of his wife having left him. Fortie was re-caled, and he stated that the prisoner came to him after his wife had left his house, but he did not inplore him to let her come back t0 him. What he did say was that she might continue to live with him, but that he should want her to come to see him twice a-week. Mr. SrI,GH then made a very able speech to the jury on lbehalf of the prisoner, aud, aftei observing upon the distressing nature of the case, said that the prisoner had clearly been driven to commit the act by the disgraeeful conduct of his wife in deserting him and her children; and said that, although the law would not justyfy the act he had committed, yet that, under-the circumstances and the gross provocation the prisoner had received, a verdict of unas.f wonding would amply meot th o justice of tha case. The learned JUDG3, in sumnming up, said that the circumstances of this case were certainly about as extraordiary as lie bad ever heard, and that the facts that had been deposed to wvere as scandalous and as disgraceful to all parties as oould be oonceived. The jury, afer a*shortdeliberation, found the prisoner ulty of unlawFfully wvounding, and at the same time recommended him to mercy, on account of the provocation he had received. The learned JuDoE said he should take an opportunity of considering the sentence that ought to be pronounced. NEW COURT. (Before fr. JUStiCC CBOnWDn.) Francis Sanley, 24, sailor, was indicted for cutting and wounding John Gilbert. Mr. Robinson prosecuted, and Mr. Sleigh defended. The prosecutor, a sailmaker, living at Plaistow, said that aboutU 1o'clock upon the rdghtof the 2d of August he was going home with his wife n daughter, who were walking on in front. The prisoner, who was coming in an opposite direction, made aome remark to the women, and upon approaching the prosecutor said, "What do you think of that? twat do you think those women said ?" Prosecutor said, " I do not know anything of them." Upon which prisoner aimed a blow at his head, and having missed triking him, said, " It is a good job I missed you.'? Prisoner then struck another blow at the prosecutor, which he fortanately received upon his hands, which were severely cnt: Prisoner then ran off and was followed, and ultimately taken in custody in the Victoria Docks. Mr. SLEIGI, for the defence, said that he could not at. tempt to deny that the prisoner had been gui'ty of an unlawful wounding, and begged of the jury to acquit him of the count chargmng the intent. The jury found the prisoner uilCy of the unlawful wfounding and he wras sentenced to 1'2 months' imprison- Watkins Evans, a hop porter, surrendered to take his trial for feloniouslyreceiving three pockets of hops, the property of Messr. Mynn and others. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Charnock prosecuted, and Mr. Sleigh defended. This case, which commenced early in the day and did not close until nearly 6 o'clock in the evening, possessed very few features of interest excepting to the parties concerned. The prosecutors are hop-merchants in Coffin-yard. Southwark, and upon the 22d of July it was discovered that three pockets of hope of a very choice description had been abstracted from their warehouse by means of breaking down a partition between that warehouse and the next. Upon the discovery takingplace aninquiry was made, andcended in three pockets of hope being traced, on the 22d, to the house of the prisoner, in .Redcross-streetk SouthLwark, where it sppeared that the hops taken from the prosecators had been put into tho ecart of a carman living in the same yard as the prisoner, the cart being engaged by some men not known. These hops were driven direct to the prisoner's, who took them in, and said it was all right. When questioned by the prosecutor the prisoner denied having had the hops in his possession, but, upon searching, three pockets of hops of the same sort as those stolen were found, but put into different cases. The prisoner also made sevoral contradiotory statements about the possession of them. For the defence it was set up that the hops found at the prisoner's house had been temporarily left without his knowledge, and were not the prosecutor's hops. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, but recommended him to mercy on account of his previous good character. Hlis LOBDSHIP said that recommendation saved him fromn penal seritude, and directed himu to be imprisoned for 18 months. __ TEHTRD COURT. (Before ae ComioN-SERJEANT.) Upon the learned Common-Serjeant takiug his seat, Mr. SLRErIo, on his making an application to postpone a trial until next sesion, took the opportanity of complaining of its being put on the list of cases to be tried in the Fourtt Court, a place which tho. bar designated " the cellar down below." It was impossible in the then state of the businems -the three other courts ritting- for the bar to go dorn int that cout, and its formation tended very much to interfera with the gentlemen of the bar paying a proper attention to the interests of their clients. M%-, RimTox, who appeared for the prosecution in the case, entirely concurred with his friend, and complained of - thoenconvenience and injustice to the prisoners of holding a fourth court. Mr. METnrLcA, another of the counsel in the case, fully agreed with the observations, strongly oondemning the practice. Mr. PAYNE explained tothe Common-Serjeant that when the. Fourth Court was first decided upon it was distinctly stated that everything should be done to prevent inconvenience to counsel an injustice to the prisoners, and the opinion of the bar was that the only way to accomplish the desired objet was by not ending any but undefendedoaes into the Fourth Court. I was all ery wel to talk of expediting business, but if time was important, justice was more 50. The Co moN-SxtJENT sald he had nothing to do with the arrangement cmplained of. The subject then dropped. Edward Ernest West, who was convicted yesterday of uttering forged receipts, was brought up for sentenoe. The COOre-SEIRuJAT taid tha, in consequenoe of his ,youth, he should pass tbe lenient sentence of six months' 'imptisonment. j G4rge Morley, 22, abemaer, andJames Smith, 21, .laouxr, *ee iditedforbuglay i te dwelling-house tof Christ4p$eioProter, g8 ° hlr..W. Cooper prosecutted, and Mr. Ribton defended I M°rley.- he pzweuthr a mboltor1 h rsn£ 68 g b rldgg- ae, Ee ent's-park, said that about 4 o'clock upon the maorning of TO 2o Augst he wa awoke by a noise in the house, and upon getting up found a strong snell of fire coming from the drawiag-roorm. He unlocked the door, which the night before he had double-locked from the outside, and found that it was secured fromn the inside. He then went i downstairs and the police shortly afterwards came. They tben forced the door, which had been wedged from the Indde, and found the room in great confusion, and some artiles of silver stolen. The prisoners were also brought back by the police. The other evidence went to sbow that the prisoners had made their entranoe from the front drawing-room windows, and were caught by the police in the act of escaping. Upon Smith was found some of the artfoles stolen, ihie Morley, when seized, had in his hand a pistol, which he was cocking. The pistoL upon being examined, was found to be loaded with ducksabot. Upon examining the drawing-room door it was found that, it being double-locked, preventing further ingress to the house, the prisoners had, with a candle and blowpipe, oommenoed burning away the post with a view to release the look. Both prisoners were Convited. Morley, who had been several times convicted, was stated to be the associate of the man who some time heck shot at a constable in the Haymarket. A dagger-knife was also found upon him. Sm ith had also beenL several times convioted. rMotruleye was sentenced to 10 and Smith to 6 years' penal Chazles Harrison, Ryder Durant, and Roger Durant, the first of whom was convicted on Monday of stealing a quaRtity of sugar, and the latter two of fbloniously receiving it, were brought up for sentence. The COM5MON-SERJRANT, in passing sentence, said the crime was one of a most serious Import in a commercial city, and called for very severe punishment. He had no doubt but that the Dnrants set up in trade to aid Harrison in plundering his employers. He then directed that Harrison should be imprisoned for 18 months, and the others kept in penal servitude for six years. John Kitto, 23, gasfitber, was indicted for stealing two watches and chains, valued at 30L., the property of Walter Capper. hlr. Payne prosecuted, and Mr. Lillev defended. The prosecutor is agentlemanlivingat Kidbrooke-terrae, Blackheath, and the prisoner and another mnn went there, stating that they had come from the gaa company to repair the burners. They were allowed to go into the different rooms whence they took the property. The prisoner was found GuiWM and sentenced to four years! penal servitude. FOURTHI COURT. (Before Mir. PRazDzRGACST, Q.C.) Georgd Ford, 28, carman, was indicted for having in his posseesion 861b. of copper, upon *hich was the mark of the: broad arrow. Mr. Petersdorf prosecuted, and Wr. Ribton defended. The case was somewhat singular. The prisoner, who it appeared bore a good character, was in the employ of a bone merchant, and upon the morning of the 12ch of this month was stopped by the police in Green-street, Blackfriar, with the bag upon his shoulder; he told them what it contaized adiding that he found it tied up in the bag (as he then had it) at the bottom of a sack of bones which had beep consigned to his master from Sheerness, and that being entitled to the metal found among the bones as a perquisite hebad taken it. Witnesses were this day called who proved these facts, adding that the bones had been sent through prisoner-s imaster for a M£r. Woolf. One of the witnesses proved Eeeing the bag with the copper come out from among the bones. The jury, however, found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenoed to two months' imprisonment.
POLICE. M?sI roXN-oumL-John Richards, alima Bland, who had been remanded upon a charge of having unlawful pessession of a Gl.-note, portion of a robbery of 1,0201. in notes, at Mnanch2ster, was again brought before the LORD MAY0n. Brett, the detective officer said that dsnce the last examination he had ascertained that previous to attempting to exchange the 5L-note at the Bank of England the prisoner had succeeded in passing another Gl.-note to Mr. Eldred, a coffeehouse-keeper in Shoreditch. The handwriting was the same on both notes, although " Mr. John Bland, 22, Oldstreet-road," was uDon one, and "Mr. John Richards" upon the other. Tfie officer added that Bland was the name in which the prisoner had been convicted on a charge of robbery at a jeweller's shop, when he was sentenoed to nine months' imprisonment, which expired about three weeks before he was taken into custody upon the present charge. The prisoner was again remanded. Ann Smith was charged with highway robbery. It appeared from the evidence of John Watkins, boatswain belonging to the bark Clive, lying in the East India Docks, that on the previous evening he met the prisoner near London-bridge, when she accosted him, and they walked together into Eastcheap. She sollcited him to accompany her to her lodgings in Kent-street, which he refused to do, and while wishing each other "Good night" in Rood-lane she managed to wrench his watch from but upon the crgy of, "Stho6p tthRieaf I" s berd as she could overtaken by a pliceman, when the proseutor's watch was found behind her on the ground. The prisoner wns sentenced to three months' imprisonmnent, writh hard labour.

AM inquirod if the constabls's life was in any peril Inspector Mackenrie.-I think not, your Worship. I have just seen him in the hospital, but he will be unable to leave for a few days. MIr. HAnL Teianded the prisoner, who made no answer to the charge, for further examination. The constable had been chiefly employed by Mr. HALL of late in taking back to Portland the numerous ticket-of-leave men whose licenses havo been forfeited. WzsTNsTsR-Richard Evans, butl6r and footman in the service of Mr. Fowler, civil engineer, 2, Queen's-square. place, Westminster, was charged with having stolen, at various times, a silver teapot, 14 forks, 16 spoons, and a great quantity of other ilver plate, value 100l. Mr. Hargrove, of the firm of Hargrove and Fowler, Parliament-street, conducted the prosecution, and briefly detailed the circumstances as afterwards proved in evidence. The prisoner had been for some years in the service, and bad charge of the plate. About a month ago, as Mrs. Fowler was about to leave London for Scotland, she desired John Smith, Mr. Fowler's. groom, to ask prisoner for the silver. The accused replied that she should have it, but, as it was not forthcoming, he again, by her directions, asked for it on the 25th of July, when the prisoner said he bad ywned it. The accused then gave Smith a letter, and sent him to a friend to endeavour to borrow money to redeem the plate, but did not succeed in getting it. The aecunsed enjoined Smith to secrecy, at the same time observing if his mistress found it out he should be locked up. Smith did not divulge the circumstance until the 3d inst., when be told his mistress. The prisoner then absconded, and was not afterwards heard of until apprehended by Inspector Cerplln, at 22, Newland-street, Pimlico, yesterday. Mr. PAYz;Tzn inquired whether the property had been found. Mr. Hsrgrove observed that a remand would be required for the attendance of some pawnbrokers where the plate had been pledged. The tickets relating to the property had been sent by prisoner's friends to Mr. Fowler's offices. Mr. Fowler had no wish to be harsh with the prisoner, but had brought the matter forward as a public duty, and to regain 'Xs Eroperty. The accused was remanded to give time for the attendance of the pawnbrokers WonsEup-sTRamr.-Gorge Uean, dressed like a country drover, was charged before Mr. D'ExscouRT with the following daring robbery:- A gentleman of landed property, named Drew, at Streatham, in Seupolk, had 1S cattle rang in one of ais pastures son the morning of Tuesday week, when they were counted snd looked toby his bsiliff, who on the foliowing Friday morning missed four of them, three heiers and a steer, which there could be no doubt had been stolen, as they had all been br<ed upon the estate, and had never been known to stray. Late on the same evening that the cattle had been stolen the prisoner presented himself writh four beasts, travel-woru, steaming, and smothered with dust, to i slaughterer named Swallow, in Holywell-lane, Shoreditch, to whom he amcounted for their condition by saying that he had driven them from Romford. market and whom he directed to slaughter two of them for him, hut to reserve the other two till next morning. Swallow killed the two, and the prisoner and other men next morning took the remaining two to a butcher's named Culliford, whom they asked to slaughter them, which he did, and tben wanted him to take the carcases to the dead-meat market and sell them in his (Cullifotd's) own namethis he refused to do, and, suspecting from that and the fact that they had not asked him to buy the earcases himself that there was something wrong about them, he told the polioe his suspicions, and Stone, a deteotive of the G division, traced the prisoner to a publichonse in Shoreditch, where he at first declared himself to be the owner of the beasts he was suspected of atealing, which he said now he had purchased at Maidstone, but Ol finding he was in custody said he had only been employed to drive them by some men, who would be probably found outside. No such men, however, could be discovered, hnd the prisoner was therefore loocked up. The identificaAion of the cattle depended upon finding their hides, -which had been removed by the thief or thieves, and this ave a great deal of trouble; but they were found atlast at a tanner's In Bermondsey, to whom they had been sold for 61. 13s., and, thongh Mr. Drew could not swear to his own cattle if he saw them, his bailiff could, and now identified these hides as those of the stolen cattle, worth about OIOL, and which he could be the more positive about s he had wveaned these cattle and brought them up himpelf. They mnst, too, have been stolen in broad daylight, or they could not have been driven to London, aa they evidently had been, the same evening. The prisoner professed that he had only been employedto drive and sell the beasts, hut he did not, he said, know by 'whom, and he was therefore committed for the completion of the enidence.
CYHAAE OF LIBEL OZX A DiRECTOR OP THE SUBMARrVIN TZlEB(R"PH COPApV.Y Thomas Diamond Evans, of No, 15, Buh-lane, city, and Vaptain Henry Thorne, of No. 11, Pall-mall, were yeterday brought before Mr. Beadon, at MarlborouRh-street Police. court, or. a summons obtained by the Ron. Frederick William Cadogan, for " having, on the 8th of August last, unlawfully published a certain letter addressed to the Editor of The Times newspaper, containing certain libel. lou and defamatory words and sentnces of and relating to the said Hon. F. W. Cadogan; also for having threatened to publish the said libel; also for having offered to prevent the publicatIon of the said libel, containing certain matters and things touching the said Hon. P. W. Cadogan, with intent to exbort money from him; and also for having then and there combined and conspired, and con. federated and agreed, to injure, oppress, and aggrieve the said Hon. F. W. Cadogan." Mr. Giffard, instracted by Messrs Humphries, Son, and Morgan, appeared for the prosecutor; Mr. Warrand, of 73, Basinghall-street, attended for Captain Thorne; and Mir. Robinson for Thomas Diamond Evans. In order to make the case clear and intelligible, it will be necessary to refer to complaints whlch have been recently made to the effect that private individuals were enabled to obtain earlier information than the Government in matters connected with the East. Li the City Article of The Times of the 1st of August some remarks were made which were presnmed to reflect on the Submarine Telegraph Company. On the 3d of August a letter from Sir J. Carmichael, the chairman of the company, was publisbed in The Times, which letter was prefaced with some observa. tions by the editor, to the effet that Government had caused inquiries to be rmade into the cause of the delay in transmitting the information in question to the public authorities-24 hours having been consumed in that which usually required only four hours - that the news was in private hands before it was furniied to the Government, and that if those private persons received the information by the same line as that which trasmitted the Government news then there was a case of gross delinquency on the part of some one; and the editor added that as Government had been unable to get any satisfactory explanation of the mystery, it was hoped that tho affair would be thoroughly sifted. The letter of Sir J. Carmichael appeared, in which this explanation was given in one of the paragraphs of the causes of the delay in the mes,vages transmitted to the East India-house and Lord Claeendon:- a I a yet know nothing, and consequnUT, unUke ' TeTimes,' will not hazard an opinion, or eTen a mspicion; but I do know that during the Crimesa war the telegaph wres we not found at fault in their part of the important duty of conveying memages to the British Govenment; and I may state, that since the establishment of our fir.t telegraphic communication with Frauce, no person in the Eervice of thls oompeny has hitherto beea uspected of betraing tbhe trust reposd In him by the publc, nor has any messge beenfelther tampered with or delayed in anyone of our offices, thougb, of ourse, we bave beea liable to our fair shAre of delays from accdental causes, for which we expected and receiled blame." Immediately after the appeance of this letter Captain Thorne called upon the Hon. F. W. Cadogan, the deputy. chairman of the company, with a letter purporting to have been written by the defendant Evans, and, after some conversation, gave him a copy of it. This letter, -which forms the basis ol the charge of libel, was sent to The Times put into type, but Its further publication witbheld on account of contemplated proceedings Mfr. G ARD then proceeded to address the Court in support of the summons. He appeared for the Hon. F. W. Cadogan, depnty.ohslrman of the Submarine MAgnetic Telegraph Company, and also one of the managing directors. The detendant Evnns, he believed, 'Was formerly in the servire of the Telegraph Company as superintendent. Captain Thorne was not known to the prosecutor. The defendants were jointly charged with having published a libel on the Hon. F. W. Cadogan, and the only conoeivable motive for this publication was that money might be extorted from the prosecutor. The case was one which involved a great and unportant public question. The libel imputed to persons holding a high position in the Submarin2 Telegraph Comi. pany that they had disregarded their dnty to the pubUl and so the world by tumpering with despatches sent to their office for transmission, by delaying iniormation Improperly, by making use of information fortheir private ands, and by favouring certain personal friends in giving their messages precedence in transmission over other me3saes sent earlier to the office. The learned gentleman then briefly detailed the evidence, and ooncluded by stating that Mr. Cadogan had felt it due to his own character and to the character of the company with which he was connected to give the earliest and the most unqualified contradiction of every assertion and insinuation containod in the letter which formed the libel in Question, The nHon. Frederick William Cadogan, sworm.-I am deputy chairman and one of the managing directors of the Su marine Telegraph Office, French and English-the chief offEoe is in CoruhilL The defendant Evans was in 1854 in the compuy's service as one of the clerks, but was discharged some time since. I reside at 136, Piccadilly, and on Saturday, the 8th of August5 about 3 o'clock inthe afternoon, I received a communication from Mr. Courtney, the secretary of the company, in consequence of which I went to the office of Mr. Sampson, a gentleman connected with Ths Times asserpapor, and had some oonverstionx about a letter sent or about to be sent to The Time,s. The same evening, abott 7 o'clock, the defendant Thorne called on me and stated thathe was a friend of the defendant Evans; that Evans was laid up with indisposition at Graves. end, and had given him a letter to deliver at the office of Tie Times newsper; that having seen the content of the letter, he suggested that Ishould read it, at the samo time placing in my hands a letter which I read. From cir. cuastances that came into mny mind I saw the defendant in the presence of Iady Cadogan. I read the letter out loud and then handed it hack to Thorne, with a request that he would let me have a oopy. The defendant said I should have a copy that night, but he must consult some friend first. During the interview CaptainThorne repeatedlysaidthat he had been mixed up with Mr. Evans in heavy pecunir en gagements with gentlemen at this end of London,rbut was not at that time with Evans. I aked him why he came to meon the subject. Hisreply was thathe thought it right I should know of the existence of this letter-that it must be to my interest and the interest of any company that the letter should not appear in print, and that he thought Evans hadbeen indiscreet m writing such a letter. The defendant added that Mr. Evans had given him the papers to deliver at Te Tim.es office, leaving tho matter entlrely in his hands. Captan Thorne went away, and returnedabout 9 o'dock, and wished me to release him from his promise to give me a copy of the lItter. I told him I would no4 and he again spoke of his pecuniary position with Evans. apWn Thorne made a co,py bthe letter fn the resenceofLdCadoamnu sex, and aere sigTnhatg lt ath hs pinod one ot the DVaton me, which I afterw aH.W gave to Mr. Dobie, solcitor, of vua ca8ter-place.

I said, "I have not seen your letter in Th2 Times." Evans said he had get the letter in his pocket, and would show it to me. I read the letter, and to the best of my belief the letter jast read is a copy of it. Evans knewr Iwas aecqainted with the Telegraph Company. Evans told me he wa going to send the. letter to Mr. Sampson, of 2te Times, and see if any alteration eould be sukgested.

On Saxturday, the 8th of Augustlast, about 2 o'clockin.theafternoon. this defendant Evans broopgt me the letter jsl produced. Captain Thorne w.a with him. Croas-examined.-I had seen Evans on the Wednesday P?nevios,and had told him to put bi communAcitlou ilihe form o'Uletter and to send it to me. It was in consequence ot this uuggostlon that he came to me with the letter on the following Saturday. Me. Robinson, for the defendant Evans, contended there was nothing to anawer, as no ease htd been made out. Mr. Warrand, for Captain Thorne. argued that no one except he was insane, would give a copy of a letter in the presence of a witnes4 if by that letter he hoped to extort money. The fact was that Captain Thorne had only intended to do a service to all parties. Mr. BEADoN gave an elaborate review of the evidence, and said that the only conclusion to which he could arrive was that Thorne had taken the letter to Mr. Cadogan's house in the expectation of obtaining money. That being so, the case was clearly brought under the clause of the Act, which made it an offence to publish a libel for the purpose of extorting money. The publication of the libel had been suffciently proved, and so bad the connexion and correspondence of Evans ard Thorne in the transacton. He sould send the defendants before a jury on the whole of the charges contained in the summons, and the prosecutor might afterwards determine the form in which the indictment should be framed.

HETW GO.BRZVMfENT OFFIC1BS. TO TE[E EDITOR OF THE TIMEM. Sir,-Mesrs. Coe and Holland, in their otherwise very appropriate letter in reference to your late remarks on the designs for the new Government offices, have flen into an error, dotLbtleas unintentionally. P.O. ferring to the terms of the judges' award, theyassame that it ws intended thereby to convey that the deigns receiving the first premiums for the Foreig and War offices respectively were alone deemed seitable for execution, and that *all the other premiums were simply marks of merit. The remark, however, of the judges is to the effect that, in order to relieve themselves from a dilemma caused by their decision in no case to award a double premium, and by the fact that they wished to reward some competitors who had incorporated the two offlces in one building in suoh a way that the one half of the building conld not be executed without the other, they met " this difficulty by treating the lower ptizes as marks of distinction for merit rather than as adicating special selection of the designs as fitted for ' separate constraction." That these remarks did not apply to ourdesigufor theForeign-office, to whichthesecondpremium was awarded, will be apparent, inasmuch au the design was for a self-contained buding, and therefore was " only suitable to "sepaateo" cons trction. We would further trespass on your space to remark that in our case, equally with Messrs. Coe and Hofland, not a room beyond the number actually required by the instructions was given by us; nor were the stipulated dimensions given for such rooms (though numbiring nearly 250) I departed from save in one or two instancea; and fuLrther, in reference to architectural decoration of the exterior, we studiously avoided anything approaching to excess in this Iartioular,-to a considerably greater extent, indoed,than did Messrs. Coe and Hofland,-avoiding the temptation of either lofty roofs,. towers, or similar appendages merely decora. tive, which, though they might have added materially to the imposing effect o our dedgn were purposely omitted, on the sole groundthat they could not be applied to any of the purposes referred to in the " instructions& Tho present Treasury buildings afford a perfectly correct example of the extent of decoration to which we felt oar. selves justified to go, hAving due reference to the businesslike obaracter sitable to a Government officoe, though not totally lgnoring the demands made by the importance of the position of the mitended building and the national credit.

Thn FORGEnY OF ADMIrALTy ~NAVY PAY-BIL -The prisoner. Charles Holloway, who stands charged with having uttered a forged navy pay-biRl of the value of 461. s., purporting to be drawn by Lieutenant W. G. H. Morgan, and endorsed by Captain Charles Frederick and Paymaster H. S. Dyer, late officers on board Her Majesty's ship Preeident, 60, paid off at Chathatn, underwent a final examination before the Earl of Darnley and the county magistrates at Rochester on Wednesday. Tho evidence against the aued fo bore out thefacts f which were given in 27i6 T1nau on the occasion of his being apprehended at Chatham on presenting the doounent for payment. Mr. A. D. Rattray, cashier at the Chathan branch of the London and-County Banl, proved the prisoner presenting the forged bill at the bank for payent; hot, owing to his not feeling satisfied with the explanations given by the prisoner he refused to cash it unless the prBon er obtained the endorsement of a gentlewan whose name he gave as a reference. The prisoner then left the bank with the intention of procuring the signature, but presented the bill to Mr. J. M. MArks, army contractor, stating thate had received the bUl from Lieutenant Morgan at Valparaiso, and that his name was William Batler, the smne as appeared on the document. On the prisoner stalting himself ;o be employed on board the Chesapeake, 50, the forgery was discovered, and he was given into custody. Captain Frederick and Lieutenant Morgan both proved that the signatures of their names to the bills were forgeries, and that they had never authorized the prisoner to sign their names. Mr. R. Prall, a solicitor, who appeared for the prisoner, attempted to show that the offence committed by the accused vas merely that of attempting to obtain goods under false pretences; the mag&rtes committed the prisoner for trial for forgery, the Admiralty prosecuting. Bail was refused, TH]B RIs AT nDintBuRGH.-The remains of the rnfortnnate man who perished in the late disastrous conflagration at Jameses-oortl, and which were disooverod * mong the ruins on Monday luat have now been Identified ts those of James Crease, a sioemaker, who resided in Kay's-court, Cross-causeway, and who, six or seven years ago, waS a polioe-constable inthe city. From the statement made by his wife it appears that on the 4th of Augut (the day before the fire) Crease left his house to caU on a person in Lothizu.etreet, i whose employment he had a son, to tell him that the boy was untwel and unable to come to his work. He never came home again; but, as he was irregular in his habits, and was sometimes awayfor several days without his wife mnowing where he had gone, she did not become alarmed, and imagined that he had gone off to the country on some of his frequent rambling excursions. After 10 or 12 days had elapsed she began to wonder at his conatinued absence, but never suspected any evil having befallen him. It ap,ears also that a slater named Walter Clak, who was assistng in extinguishing the fire at James's-court, saw and convers. ith the deceased there shortly after the flames broke out, and while the iiremen were waiting for water; after the water came, however, they lost sight of each other in1L the confusion, and Crease was seen nO more In the pocket of the fragment of trousers left unconsumed on his mutilated remains ws found a letter or cetificate of character addressed to him, and bearing his name, and also a hoot buttonhook, both of which his wife identified as ha"ng belonged to herhusband, He has left a widow and three children Although by trade a shoemaker, Crease did not work much at his ownbu4nass, but tookjobs as a porter or messenger. He vsweRllknown to many members of tho police fore, who speak of him as having boo of a very daring and venturous disposition, and just the most likely man to be foremost and active at such a catasrophe as the late fire-dinburgh Daily Ilim CLBGY A?D ^m DrvoRcB BiA.-The least we can say of this concssion to the clergy is that it is a very singular one, and withal intensely inconsistent. It enables the clergyman to show his righteous indienation against one sinner, while it leaves him under the ob atlon to pronounce his blessing on others quite as bad. e will not midertake to settle the relative guilt of adultery and simple fornication, but the latter is unquestionably a great crime. Clergymen are often required to marry persons the fact of whose previous illicdt intercourse is but too ap. parent. In such eases guilt has been contracted t least only second in degree to that of adultery, yet here the clergyman his no discretionary power to withhold the rites of the church. Moreover, if the clergyman is allowod to withhold the rites of the church for one species of moral guilt, why not for another? If he stickles at unchastity, why not at lying, drunkenness, and theft? It is alleged, indeed, that the present Bill involves a change of lasw, and would thus lay him under disabilities which he did not contemplate when he entered the sacred office. So far as he is conoerned the allegation is not true. For the last 200 yea mariages have regularly been annlled b the Legislature and the clergyman was bound, if eiJred, to jolemnie teo re-marriage of the parties, whether innocent or guilty, thug divorc ALI the clergy now living selected their profession, well knowing that they might be calledupontoofficateatthemaarr rueofdivoroodpersons,nd tbatif calledupon theywonld-baturndtocomplv Bvthe preeent Bil they woullmerely bave to do for th; middle classes and the poor what they have hitherto done without demur for the wealtheir and aristocratic portion of society, audit is dicutttotithat a clerical conscienoe can discriminate with nicety between a plebeian and a titled offender. If the concession is to stand alone, we have no disotion to grrel very violently with it. Thoulh it IN a* boon wbichtheolergy, as the ministers of a State Church, h alno right to expect, we are willing, in shear Ikndnese, to make them a present of it. The House of Commons were no doubt influenced by a touch of amiability towards the humble petitioners whose alleged scraples lay at their cery; gasd as for Lord Palmereton, he, good man, haa ilreauy leaned too well the political value of clerica aid to forego the opportunity of doing a good turn to 91000

THE M.LTLITA. TO TEHE EDITOR OF TEE TfES. Sir,-I wil not go into aU the perkiculhs of "A Country Squire's" letter, but I do tnk it right, In jastoe to the paying public and to the regiment to which I belong, to state that we are not only furnished with the best desrip. tion of rifle, bat that we have the additional advantage of an instrnctor trained at the School of Musketry, for the purpoee of teaching the men the use of this exoellent weapon. We certainly lost 400 men during the Crmean uggle, but we wrer proud of having had it in our power to provd them at a time in which they were so much needed; nor WBI tbiu prvent us from trning out 800 bayonets, and being ready to make further oontributions to the line, if oaLwed upon to do so. An indefatigable colonel (an old soldier), a good adjulant, and offioers, who, when acting in garrison or in camp with the line, were not looked apon as either "muaffs orold women," have brought thiL about, and I therefore beg that all militia regimens may not be mecsured b the same standard as that towbich "A Country Squire" KIlohgs. * rn.Sh nr.ih AA;-I ,.' .WILLAM1 3.- ThRNEIP i;;or A mRIRm.. u wU4vX VMLVQU YWV1Q UIUD1 &ugmt a .

The prisoner further stated that he had been in company with a woman on the evening of the murder, and after the deed was committed he returned tobger and ayed with her the remainder of the niplht, He refused to - swho this woman was, but he de,Ared that the did not give himt any chang of linen,h that there was no btood uion hm-,. and that the shirt il which he should be hanged was the, sate he wore when he oommited the murder. Since his convicton Edwards ham beens visted by the :ev. Thomas Knott, e Dissenting rminb ere; and at times he appeared to pay great attention to his exhortations and to bhe oxtremely penitent, and frequently exprosed a hope tha his soul would be saved. It is to be feared, however, that a good deal of tbis was uasumed, for dring the absence of the clergyman he frequently made use of very ba language ancd s,oke with eat levity upon the subject of his crime. Fox, on theot er hand, wasB evidetyde yiivsdwith the enormity of his crime, anda zincere desire~ obtain forgiveness for it from the Almighty Power. He paid themnost earnest attention to the siritual exhortations of Iii. Rev. Watsdn King, the chapli of the gaol, and reooeived the srment in higs cell an before the fatal niorment. Ever since their conrviction the culprits have been placed in separate cells, and have been constantly attende byth warders, of the prison. Shortly before 12 o'clock M1r. WlIdes, the Under-Sherlgf' of Kent, accompanied by a number of his ollleers, proceeded to the gaol, and shortly aLfterwards the culpritswere brouogha, into a room, where the process of pinioning them was performed by Calcraft, the executioner. Before Ibs was dne they shookc hands with each other. Fox seerded quite comxposed and calm, but it was L.ident thAt the near approach' of death had completely daunted and almost unnerved the, other culprit, for he trembled violently while Calcraft. was pinioning him. The usual procession was tha-a formed, and while the culprits were proceeding to the place Of execution, which is at a considerable distance from the cels werethy hd pevousy benconfined, Fox sang a hyn. Te cuprit the moutedthe scaffold, and th rceed havig ben cosplted the drop, theoer pings~~~~~~~naai It appears that neither of the prisOners saw any of their relatiOns until Wednesdazy morning, when Edwards w& 'sited by his coosin anud his youngest brother, a boy 12 years old. Ho had written to request hbi father and mother to see him, bat they felt themselves unequal to the task of Parting with him under such eireumstanoes. Fox ws visid ao on W edusday by Wiu siser and her husband. The swene was represented *as being most affecting. The culprit. it appeaed, had wrlttea to his father tocome and se him, but e, lke the parentgof Edwads, felt unequal to the task of taking forewell of a son in such a dreadful position, and therefore dia not comply with the request. It appears that a petition for a commutation of the sentence upon Edwards was sent to Sir G. Grey by the Anti. Punishment of Death Society, and the ground upon wb1hW it was apphed for was that the evidenoe against him ws entirely circumstantial, and that the prisoner persisted im declaring his inuocece. The aswer retrned was tlati there were no circunstanoes in the case such as would justif any interference with the course of the law. The bodies after hanging the usual time, were cut down, and in the course of the day were buried within the gsol; pursuant to the terms of the seutenwe.
THn SAL OF POISONS.-We have already giveia An abstract of the Sale of Poisons Bill In its amended fom, the modified measure, however, being only printed for the consideration of the public during the approscbing recess. Yesterday was published a blue-book of 140 8S eonhnin the interesting evidenoe adduced Wbeore ta sledo ommiLttee of the House of Lords by the following witnesaes-viz." Mr. J.Bell, Mr. T. N.RLMorson, Mr.G.Waugh, Xr.P. Squire,. M1r. Lionel Bird, Mr. Hi. Denie, Mr. J. Abrahatm, Mr. J-. Baker Edwards, Mr. Wiliam Herspath, Mr. Hammill, Mr.. F. C. Cavert, Mr. Walter Wilso334 Dr. W. T. Brands, F.RS., Mr. S.J. Burch, M.R.C., Dr. A. Swaine Taylor(the toxicologist), and Dr. Moore Neligan. The evidenea of Mr. Herapath and other witnesses points to leglative,- onactments as utterly impotent to prevent suicide by, poisons. "If a suicide,' observes this witness, "canm. not have recourse to one mode of destroying his life he will to another." Even the Bil restricting the sale of arsenic has not been altogeter successful. Mr. HerM conceives that any " Poisons" Bill must have three ob3ects in viewv,-L Secret poisoning. 2. Soicide; and, 3. Chance. medley. He does not believe that auv one ssem ean b. introduced to check the whole of these; nd as tosuicide he thinks "it will be to hnpoe, under any circumstances, to prevent t" As re lntentional poisonirg, he thinks reg on in a ;ok: anight do something to check it. Mr. Horaph o- jectod to the absurdity of includin in the schedule of poisons prohibited so large a number of ParmacoA * 'l preparations, al of them being used more or lees for medioal purposes. He thinks the list shonld be confied todrugs that may be used for secret pisoning, as those which are taslesos o,r not to be recognized by the victim are few in number. He would prohibit for secret poisoning, asenic, Fowler's solution (or the liquor potas srsenitis, prussi. acid, strychnia, end fux vonuca; for hocuagng, cooculus indicus; and for procuring abortion, ergvt oi rye and savina. It would be impossibl, or very difficult, to legislate as regaids opium. Mr. Haumill, the police.-magistrate, appears to object to compel persons wanting to buy poisouo.u drugs to go before a magistrate; he think8 'vit ould be a grat impediment to the adminisration of miedicine, in proper cases, because theme are few medicines that are not, in large doses, poionus,"'p He does not think you oould leise for the s of. laudanum, because a poor man, although " distressed" i apleearance, might want it for the tothache as well asa rch man. Any medical man, too, will bear testimony tothe immense value of opiom, both in the solid end liq*iA form, as a cheek to cholerabc dirrhoaa ancd other alarm,in affections of the intestinal cusal Dr. Tsylor, the to3ioologist, thinks that le"glation would have the effect, not of doing away with oisoning In any form, but of consldrmWr reducing the number of accidents from poison, and as nnt. dering it more esy to trace out crlme where Poion s-- been obhsmned for improper It is im3posible, hec adds, to preventthe ruse A poison for suicidil purposes.
