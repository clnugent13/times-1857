PoLWrcz SouTrwAim-For aeverdays pst a conxiderable deal of excitement has been oaued iin the neighbourhood of London-street, Dockhead, In onseqence of it being reported, and actulybelievedby mny,thaton of the houses was haunted b a veritable ghost. The howe in question was inhabited by a vorking. man named Baker and his wife and daughter. Whlez the man wax out in the daytime at his work rngular nois were heard In al pat of the house, And brealdgn of erkery, glas, &uL,- which were thrown abouxt in all directions by some invisibIe hand. Mr. Hanok, a gtleman connected with the District Visiting Society, inquired into the crcumstanoee, and soon found out that the gho*t was no other than the daughter, a young girl about 12 eas of age. A communication wu mde with the Rev. Mr. Martin, the rector of C ricurrcb ad It was ascertined that she was a very bad girl, exoeedingly Wdle and dirty, and fond of wandering the streetg to get into bad company. To p-ovent her from following her bad inclinations she was oonfined to the house, when she broke her fatherex crockery and furniture in such a mysierious way as to cause the "ePort bigspread that theJousewas1hauntod. The father - vioo The fher, by the ad oe of other persons, gave her Into custody, and she was brought before Mr. Cozm, at this court, chrged with oomitting the wilful damage to her fatbers goods.W The Rev. Ma ll Mrtin wa in attendance, and informed his worship that the girl was very bad indeed, and refused to obey the wishes of her parents, who had a corfortable home. The father stepped forwx and aid he did not know what to do with his daughter. He had no Idea at first that it was she that brol-e his thigs sa his wife told him that she was in the same room with the girl when the thing were thrown about, and she did not te brouch anything. They both beieved that it was the work of a ghost, and that the hows wsas haunted. Mr. Co3tDz asked whether shoe hd committed much Th father repliea that she 'had broken almost everythiln, and had besdes frightened him and his wife very Mr. COMER Inquired whether it had been ascertained how she contrived to break the crockery without being peroeived by her mother. The father said that he understood she fixed halr to the articles and pulled them off the shelves. . In answer to the charge, the prisoner sullenly said that .her father and mother would not let her go out; therefore she broke the things to frighten them. Mr. ComBrE told her that he understood she had a cornfortable home and could be of asstnoe to her parents. Why did she not help to keep the house clean ? That would be much better than idleness. He, however, did not think there woulid be any use in speaking to her. The better way would be to sencl her to prison. The Rev. Mr. Martin thought so. She was a very bad girl, and would not amend her ways, although every Inducenment had been held ouit to her. e Mr. Co3me severely lectured ber as to her bad conduct, and, In default of paying for the dagmag she had committed, sentenoed her to the House of Correction for 14 days. The juvenile ghost was then sent to Wandsworth gaoL LAxBxmaH.Mrn ELLroTT was engaged for some time in the invetgation of one of the most singular cases that have ever, perbae been brought unc'er a judicbainIrquiry, and the exzr^or mary circumnanoeodiudoeed in the course of the inquiry fully verif- the fact that truth is stranger than fiction." It appeared that in the summer of I'50 Mr. John Blair WAis, a member of amoetrespectable family, and at that time a medical student, met in an omrni bus a younglady at whose appeamnce he became so charmed that he foloiowe her to her residenoe, and by mueh perseverancoe discovered that her friends resided at Bath. Thither he proceeded, and, having found out her mother made a formal offer of marrn to the yoUng lady, her daughter. Hisption formed so bar whatever to the accomplishment of desres, but the ae of the young lady, not beS;g th quite 13, was stiocessuly urged as an insuperable objectiou to her marage, and here themmatterat thattime nded. In 1855 the parties met in, by aoddent, In the Srrey-grdens, and the lady belig then 17, and her charms having increaed by her years, Mr. Wills determined on having her for lhi wife, and having this time secnred the consent of her mother, the prHtes were marrIed at. ennington Church, on the 24th of March, 155 By this time Mr. WiLs had changed h profesdon having prefer,ed the business of an architect to that of a'surgeon, and t, e- 'young couple appeared to live hanppiy together, untl shortly after Ithes onfinement of Mr. Wills, when she bad a violent attack of milk fever, whlch so affected her mind that it was found ne y to place her in Bethlehem. At this institution she remaned 12 months, and that being the utmost limit for patients of her class being kept there the authorities of the institution caused a communi. cation to be made to her husband and friends, requasting that, though not quite recoveredshe might be taken away. he husband, however, appeaed to take no notice whatever of the matter, but his friends finding that it was absolutely necessary to remove her, Mr. James Fenton Wills, her brother-in.law, took her from Bethlehem to the residenoe of his mother, 15, Osman.terrace, Capham-road. Here she remained several days without being able to her a word about her husband or chUd. and having naturally evinced great anxiety on the subject her mother-in-law bhnded her a letter, received from her husband, requestlng that she would call on hin at a certain time and place in the city. i She accordingly went to the place indicated, andon seing her husband she reproached him with unkindness and want of attention. His oool and healess reply was that she mnst not glve herself any trouble about him; that, in fact, she was no wife of his, for that he bad been married to another when he had wedded her, and that tberefore the had no legal cLaim whatever on him. He added,-"The only and best thing you can do Is to marry my brother Fenton; he loves you, will marry you, and maoke O huband." Singplrltmayappear,this ldbrother.in.w, James Fenton wils, nafew ays madeprofesdons of love and attachment to the wife of his brother, and also an offer of mrriage. The poor afficted creature, under the impreasion that she was not lgapUy the wife of John Blair Wills, and having reoeived marks of kindness at the hands of James Fenton Wills, consented to her mariasg with the latter, and on the 21st of August last the oeremony of marriage took place at the Registrar of Marrlages office adjoining Lambesth Workhouse A this took place unknown to the friends of the young lady, and when made acqnsAnted with the facts her mother at onoe came to town, and made an application on the subject An inquiry was in oonsequenoe set on foot, which led to the discovery that, instead of John Blair Wills having been, as he represented, married in 1851, his second marriage with a Mis Ann Goodc did not take place until April Iat, and therefore he had been clearly guilty of an act of bigamy. A warrant was in consequenoeissued for his apprehension, but by some means or other he has up to the nresent eluded the vigilanoe of the offioer in whose hands the warant for his apprehendsoa h a been placed. In the meantime the seaond husband, if he may so called, James Fenton Wils, deserted the poorwoman, and Ms Wills beingfarfrom well was placed in the infirmary of lambeth, where every care and attention was paid her, and thus she of conrse became a burden to the ratepayers of the perish. The pais officers becoming acquaintedlwith the fact that shha been married in their pariah to Mr. James Fenton Wills, and believing that he was legally liable for her maintenance, applied for and obtained a summons, calling on him to show cause why on order to that effect should not be made against him, and Sat dy s was appointed for its hearing. On Saturday Mr. James Fenton Wills, who is a young man of gentlemanly appeance, wering mustaches, and about 27 years of age, attended in obedience to the summnons, accompanied by Mr. Henry Fryer, of 2, Gray's Inn. place, Gray's-inn, his solicitor. Mr. Bxnet, clerk to the IAmbeth Board of Guardians, attended tosupport the summons. Mr. Thomas nners, one of the regises of marriages for the perish of Lambeth, produced his register, in which there was an entry of marriageon the 21st day of August it between James Fenton Wills, 27, widower, and Marion Maxwell, 20, spbister, and sid he was prent at the r, rLLIOnT.-Should you know the paries who were so married?

-FOREIGN IJ2YTBLLGEPNORO a- e liR. A Nnv (taom OUR OWN OORUE8PONDTl PARIS, Nov. 13, 6 P.At. An Imperial decree has been issued, declaring that in consequence of the eminent services rendered to the State by the late AL Abbatucci, Minister of qustice, his funeral shal take place at the public expense. The ceremony wil be performed to-morrow, at 11 o'clock, at the church of the Madeleine. A gun will be fired every hour at the Invalides from 7 o'clock in the morning until the departure of the body from the hotel of the Minister of Juatice. Two salutes of 15 guns each will also be fired, the first when the body leaves the hotel, and the second at the moment of committing it to the earth at Pbre la Chaise. The funeral cortege will proceed to the Madeleine by the Rue de Ia Psix and the boulevards. The constituted authorities and the public functionaries invited to the ceremony must be at the hotel at 10 o'clock. Places are reserved in the church for the persons invited by the family who also assemble at the same hour at the residence of the deceased. His mortal remains were the day after his death placed in a clutpeUe ardeute in the hotel, the public being admitted from 11 to 4 o'clock. The names of a good many persons are put forward as likely to suceeed to the place left vacant by the deceased Mlinister. Among those whose chance appears the best is AL Rouland, Miniater of Public Instruction, who would in that case be succeeded by NI. Royer. A letter from Belgrade of the 5th inst. informs us that the Criminal Court had pronounced judgment on the conspirators accused of having planned the death of the reigning Prince. Seven of the prisoners have been sentenced to decapitation; one only has been condemned to perpetual imprisonment, It waa believed at Belgrade that Prince Karageorgewitch will commute the senteuce of death into imprisonment with hard labour. A despatch from Jassy, published by the Levant, gives the latest proceedings of the Divans ad hoc. that assembly, after 'some animated debates, has voted that all citizens are equal in the eye of the law. It has likewise voted the abolition of all classes and privileges, and the liberty of public worship. It is shortly to consider the question of forced labour Ito which the peasants are subjected. This last question, which affects the rights of private property, will present much difficulty. The note already announced as having been presented by the Porte to the European Powera is not drawn up in the same form as the notes hitherto presented. The last contains extracts from various r eports presented by the Kmakans of Moldavia and w Bllachia, which represent those countries as completely disorganized and in a state of anarchy. Several facts are quoted in support of theae assertions. The discontent occaioned by the conduct of the French Consul-General in Egypt with reference to the United Catholics has not yet subsided. Owing to his interference with the Pasha the chapel is still shut up; and they who refuse to accept the Gregorianl calendar, attempted to be imposed on them by the Papal delegate and the Patriarch, are still debarred from the exercise of their woship. I mentioned the other day that a letter was addressed to the Pasha by the Grand Vizier, remonstrating on this act of intolerance, and desiring that it should cease. The letter waa sent to the Consul forthwith, with a message from his Highness to the eftect that he considered this sect of Christians as treated with much harshness, that it was not becoming the Egyptian Government to lnterfere with the religious rites of the Sultan's subjecta, and that the Ottoman Porte, as well as himself, was concerned to find that such intolerance was practised by Christians against Christians in his pashalic. A more recent letter states that the Consul sent for the priest of the chapel, the doors of which had been shut upby his own act, for the purpose of proposing that he should resume his functions in the church from which he was originally ejected, and that in it an altar should be placed for those who had resisted the new calendar, and another for those who accepted it. The priest declined the proposition, but asked to be allowed the use of the chapel which his flock had purchased out of their own funds, and which no one had a right to touch. He added, that he should write to the Patriarch to inform him of the Consul's offer. What the Patriarch may decide is not yet known; but it is diflicult to comprehend the conduct of the iFrench Consul-General. He can hardly be serving the interests of his Government in the East by thus sowing dissension among the Eastern Christians, and by exciting town against town and village against village. If RuBsian agents were doing so it maight be at once explained, but it is bad policy ot the French Government to foster religious hatreds among the Orientalk. Can it be that these agents are acting on their own private account, and from the vanity of displaying authority ? The home Government has been remonstrated with on the conduct of its subordinates, and assurances given that it has communicated with Rome, Constantinople, and Alexandria. What the explanations are that have been demanded, or what are the instructions that have been sent, are yet a secret. The Porte has also communicated with Rome; but the habits of the Papal Court are slow and cautious, and even if (which is improbable) it disapproved the fieryzeal of its delegate in theEast, its decision will have to be waited for yet awhile. In the meantime a strong feeling is spreading among the ignorant population, and mattebs may come to such a -point that France may deem her interference necessary. It would be curious if we were to see her performing the same part with the United Catholics that the Emperor Nicholas plaved with the schismatics. As for the Propaganda, lt clearly designs to efface the marks which distinguish this ancient branch of the Eastern Church from the Latins; it is stealthily feeling its way, and the abolition of the old calendar will probably be followed by the destruction of some other venerable usage. But it is strange to see Prance, with its Gallican independence, give a helping hand to the Roman Propaganda. Yet against the innovation the opposition is Btill very strong. Out of 4,000 United Catholics at Damascus 700 only have accepted the Gregorian hagiology, and several of them would probably accept the Koran on the same consideration. The Vicar-General (who is a bishop) stands out against his own immediate superior, the Patriarch, and will not have the new alendarz. The Vicar-General of Egypt (also a bishop) follows his example; and of 450 famies who adhere to the ancient rule about 27 have adopted the new one, and, in order to withdraw theniselves from this petty persecution, 120 persons have gone over to the schismatics, and consequently are lost to Rome. At Cairo there are about 800 United Catholics, of whom 30 families have accepted, but the VicarGeneral holds good against the innovation. With the exception of 18 or 20 famiales, the populations of Jaffa are firm in their fidelity to the old calendar, and Jerusalem remains the same. The Bishop of Tyre (a near relative of the Patriarch) has indeed embraced the Gregorian calendar, but he is forced to use the old one out of deference to or apprehension of his flock. Heis content to invoke saints and ractise rites in which he has little belief. Sidon has also refused; bnt St. Jean d'Acre has accepted -that is tae town, for the rural population have spumed the innovation, and Beyrout, Balbec, and others have done similarly. The peesistence in forcing on a people a measure which they detest, and which, after all, is no dogma of faith, is strange enough. The co-operation of the French ConsulGeneral (who is not a bishop) is still more to be wondered at, unless It be supposed that he and his colleagues in that part of the world are paving the wav of ome formal intervention on the part of the "eldest son of the Church." A letter from Nantes, dated Wednesday Uast, informs us that the arrival in that town of the Mo,ni&ear containing the Imperial decree pemitting the export of corn and flour had produmed considerable excitement andgeneral satisfaction. Several large purchases of grain were made, and the electric teinegraph offices were crowded with persons sending messages announcing sales or purchases and the despatch of cargoes. Several ships unemployed in the port were forthwith chartered. Trade, whieh was langushing at Nantes, had become animated by the promulgation of the decree.

Abbatucci, late Minister of Justice took place this day. The body lay in state at the hotel of the Minister in the Place VeYnd6me, and the public were admitted yesterday from 11 o'clockin themorning to 4 inthe evening. A decree of the 24th Meesider, year 12, according to the Gregorian calendar the 15th of July, 1803, has presc-ibethe salutes to be fired when, as is the present case, a deceased Ministers funeral is at the expense of the State. Pursuant to that ordiance minnute guns were fired at the Invalides at 7 o'clock this morning, and continued till 11 o'clock. At this hour the corMtge left the hotel of the MIinister in the Place VendOme, and arrived at the Church of the Madeleine by the Rue de la Paix and Boulevards. The coffin was placed on a catafalque before the altar. The civil and military authorities assembled at the official residence at 10 o'clock, and accompanied the remains to the church, where places had been reserved for them, as also for 60 Senators, and 40 members of the Legislative Corps. They were all in full dress, and the judges were in their robes. At 1 o'clock the cortiqe left the church, and proceeded to the cemetery of Pere La Chaise by the Boulevards. It was oDened by a squad of sergems de ville formed in line. Then came a regiment of Hussars of the Guard, followed by six battalions of the Line and a squadron of the Guards of Paris. Marshal Magnan andifour Generall officers, with their respective staffs, were at the head of the troops. The hearse next followed, drawn by six horses with the usual sable trappings. The sons of x Abbatucci as chief mourners followed, and the Grand Croes and Riband of the Legion of Honour were borne on a cushion by one of the attendants. The corners of the pall were held by Marshal Pelissier, M. de Royer, ProcureurGeneral of the Court of Cassation, XBillault, Minister of the Interior, and MI. Fould, Minister of State. The official and private servants of the deceased followed. Then came eight mourning coaches, followed by one of the Emperor's carriages, and not less than 60 equipages belonging to representatives of foreign Powers' and to private friends of the deceased Minister. Each battalion of infantry and squadron of cavalry had its full band; the drums were muffled, and the trumpets and eagles covered with crape. A squadron of the Guards of Paris followed, and two lines of cavalry flanked the procession. At a considerable interval camne two companies of Foot Chasseurs, five battalions of the line, a battalion of mounted Chassaars, two batteries of Artillery, and a squadron of Hlussar, closed by a detachment of the Paris Guards. Two General officers commanded this latter division of the cortege. A squadron of the Paris Guards kept the passage clear, The side paths of the Boulevards, froma the Madeleine to the B3astille, were crowded, and the respect which is invariably paid to the dead by the French was exhibited on this occasion. No man remainred covered when the hearse passed before him. The weather was fine, and the approaches to the church and Place Vend6me were thronged. When the funeral cortege arrived at the Cemetery of Preo La Chaise the remains of the deceased Ministerwere carried to a vault, where they remain unitil they are transported to Zivaco, in Corsica, the burial place of theAbbatucci family. Prayers for the deceased were recited by the Abbe de Guerrr, curd of the Madeleine. Two speeches were delivered, one by M. Fould, the Minister of State, and the other by M. Royer, Attorney-General at the Court of Cassation. The ceremony was concluded by a salvo of artillery.

All Arm anxOns to be off, and there Is great competition for the little freight that offers. It is almost impossible to name with certainty a day for the sailing of any vessel, but we will state what we can gather of their progress. ;Uhe Electra, a very fine American-built clipper ship, Dutch owned, has on board about 1,250 bales wool, 50 tons tallow, 150 tons cocoanut oi 8,000 hides, and sundries.

A goo I many pa6sengers will take advantage of her excellent ac commodation to proceed by her, and she offers a good chance for conveyance of speoe and for duplicates of letters by this mail. The Centurion has a large quantity of wool, tallow, and hides on board, and does not require much to fill up. We expect her to sail in all this month. Many of her cabins are engaged. Maid of Judah.-This favourite ship is well advanced in loading, large shipments of wool, tallow, hides, and gum having been made by her. She wil leave about the sam time as the Centurion.

MONBY-MAIUCETatwozilyin.TALL,Gff,VOR. Saturday Evening. The panic is gradually subsiding, and the efforts of those who boast of the mean deceptions and contrivances by which it was promoted are now turned in an opposite direction. The funds have accord ingly closed this evening at a further advance of a half per cent. Consols for money opened at the price of last evening-89 to i, and at the official close the quotations were 894 to i for money, and 89i to 90 for the account. After regular hours there was a fresh improvem8ent of at eighth, the latest bargains for the account being at 90 to i. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 213; Reduced, 88i to J; New Three per Cents., 884 to I; India Stock, 211 to 214; and India Bonds, SOs. to 40s. discount. Exchequer-bils were again slightly better owing to the impresion that it may be intended to relieve the market by funding a considerablo portion of the amount outstanding, and the final quotation was 21s. to 15B. discount. The rate for short loans on Government securities in the Stock-Exchange to-day was 8 per cent. At the Bank of England and in the dicount-.markct the demand, although extremely heavy, agaia showed a diminution. As the Bank Charter Act had not been infringed up to Thursday evening, it was thought possible the same result might be witnessed as In 1847, when, although the authority was given, it was not found necessary to use it. It now appears, however, that the regular issue has been exceeded, and that an Act of Indemnity will have to be obtained from Parliament. La.t night the excess of credit notes ia circulation beyond the prescribed fourteen millions was 180,0001., and to-day it is believed the amount will be found to have been further increased. The transactions in foreign stocks have been unusually numerous, but the market generally continues depressed; Turkish, however, closed J per cent. higher, and Buenos Ayres were dealt in at 84, being 2i per cent. above the last price, the intelligence having arrived that the agreement entered into by the Government has been brought before the Chamber of Representatives. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 98; Mexican, 17i and J; for the account, 18; Peruvian Four-and-a, Half per Cents., 74i; Portuguese, 42k; Russian Five per Cents., 106; ditto, Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96i; ditto, Small, 96J; Spanish New Deferred, 25; for the account, 25k; Turkish Six per Cents., 87k andJ; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 96S and Ji; Venezuelan Four-and-threeQuarter per Cents., 25; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 96i and J. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 40c. for money, and 16f. 55c. for the end of the month, showing a fractional improvement. At Vienna the prewure increases. At Hamburg the rate of discount has receded from 10 to 9l per cent. There were no gold withdrawals from the Bank to-day, the only transaction being a sale to them of 3,0001. The Africa to-day has taken out 55,0001. for New York, chiefly in sovereigns. The Vanderbilt has taken onlyl1,3501. The West India steamer Atrato has brought 155,000I The suspension was announced this morning of MesO Jelllcoe and Wix, Turkey merchants; also of Mes3rs. Jos6 P. De 86 and Co., fn the Brazilian trade. The liabilities in the first case have not been stated. In the latter they are small. Messrs. De Si and Co. have been brought down by the failure of Gllumaraes and Co., of Paris, mentioned two day, back. The news of the suspension of the Bank Charter Act taken out to America to-day by the Africa from Liverpool will probably be received at New York before the arrival there of the Atlantic, which sailed onWednesdaylast, theAdmiralty having given permission for the Africa to touch at Cape Race, Newfoundland, whence communication will be made by telegraph. As the advices by the Atlantic were of a very gloomy character, comprising the advance of the Bank rate to 10 per cent., the stoppage of the Western Bank of Scotland, the City of Glasgow Bank, and Messrs. Sanderson, and the drain of a couple of mllions of gold to Scotland and Ireland, they would be calculated to excite fear, oE an approaching convulsion, and thus create a relapse from any improvement that might have occurred in America. Hence it is very important they should be anticipated, if possible, by the news of to-day. The Vanderbilt, from Southampton, also sailed tbi; afternoon, and it is believed that she likewise will call at Cape Race. The commercial accounts from Bombay are satis. factory. At Calcutta a favourable turn of about 2 per cent, appears to have taken place in the rate of exchange. At Shanghai also there has been a similar movement to the extent of 1 per cent. At, Iongkong the quotation seems -to have gone in an adverse direction, belng about 2i per cent. higher. The Peninsular and Oriental Company have to-day received Intelligence of their steamship Norna being on her way from China to Suez oa special service. The Norna will have reached Suez about the 12th inst., and will remain at that port until the arrival there of the mails, leaving London on the 16th inst., by the European and Australian Company's packet, 1id Marseilles, and will then be despatched for Bombay. An opportunity will thuw be afforded to the public of transmitting letters to Bombay of six days' later date than those now en 9oute by the Peninsular and Oriental Company's contract packet which left Marseilles on the morning of the 12th inst. The private advicefs from New York by the North Star state that the news by the Persia, which brought out 240,0001., was better than had beea expected. More produce was moving from th, West; the banks were discounting choice paper rather more freely, and the general tone was decidedly better. The belief consequently waa that unless very bad news should arrive from Europe the worst might be considered past. In that respect the failure of Messrs Dennistoun is the most serious. Probably, however, before it arrives out the various markets wril have sufficiently recovered to enable it to be met without throwing everYthing back into increased confusion. under any circumstanoes, however, the improvement would be slow until the opening ot the canals in the spring, so as to allow of produce being brought down in larger quantities. 20,000 sovereigns which came out by the Baltic had been sent back to England by the next return stea'mer. The rate of exchange had further advanced, some transactions having occurred at 103. Gold from this side therefore would fail as a speculation. The only further suspension of any importance had been that of George Warren and Co., large dry goods importers, at Boston. Messrs. Coutts and CO. have intimated that their allowance for money on deposit will be limited to 5 per cent., notwithstanding the recent advances in the Bank rate of discount, as they consider this the maximum compatible with perfect security in its employment. . The directors of the City of Glasgow Bank have Iinterted an advertisement in the 1orth British Daily I Mail, calling upon the depositors, -with a view to enable the Bank to resume business, to allow their deposits to remain at four months' notice, until it is again in a position of ease. The directors think it probable the Bank will soon be able to allow depo-. sitors on open account the usual facility of drawing and lodging as formerly. Several of the perzons moat largely interested have already concurred in this arrangement. ^,The following doumnents pubn;ied .by the @ vernment of Buenos Ayres to the Chamber of Representatives for the settlement of the claims of the foreign debt of that Republic have been received by the Brazil steamer just arrived:- " Buenos Ayre, Sept. 28.

" Subjolned is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-At a meeting of the Sambre and Mfeuse the chief points of discussion were the report of the committee of shareholders and the coal traffic. Notwithstanding the sum brought to the company by the development of this last source of revenue the general receipts for the half-year show a falling off of about 2,660, while the worklng expenses have been about 4401. more than in the corresponding period of 1856. The rolling stock is- stated to be in excellent order. A proposed amalgamation with the Chatelineau and bouvain and Chatelineau and Morialme Companies has fallen through. The report of the West Flanders states that the receipts on the old line have increased fully 6801. and on the two guaranteed lines 7901. and 4201. respectively. There i every prospect of a further steady progress from the fne harvest and the soundness of Belgian trade. Lem heavy eng,ines are being used, by which a saving intheworldng expenses is realized. The works from Lichtervelde to Fumes are proceeding rapidly, and more than half that line is ready for opeuig. The dividend to be declared at the general meeting in Belgium is 2s. 6d. per share. The report of the Great North of Scotland states that the receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of August amount to 59,18., and the expenditure (including 9,715. for interest on loans) to 32,6671. The proposed dividend is at the rate of 4* per cent. The traffic has largelv increased, the opening of the 1anff, Macduff and Tur ' Junction Railvay having contributed, The Alford Valley, and Inverness and Aberdeen Junction are in course of construction, and are hoped to be completed next year. The first portion of the East Kent line, from Chatham to Faversham, wiiU be formally opened on Wednesday. The report of the lomouthshire states the receipts for the past half-year to be 6481. less than those of the preceding period, but 3,9701. in excess of those of the corresEonding six months in 1856. A dividend at the rate of o per cent. per annum is recommended. Proceedings have been taken to raise the capital required to complete the Worcester and Hereford and Cork and Youghal Railways. The foUowing information with regard to the mining business of the week in condensed from the Mining Journal:- C Notwithstanding the rise in the Bank rate, and the pressure on the Londor money-market there has been a fair buiness transacted in mines, chiefly on Cornish account. The Cam Bre lMines have declared their 95th halfE yearly dividend of 21. per share, making 2371. lOs. already paid on each 15. share. At Craddock Moor Mine meeting on November the 6th the accounts for July and August showed a balanoe of L2201.; a dividend of 7s. per sbare was declared.

SHiPrPDG DISASTMSS OX THE EASTEBW COAST.- Last week was agaia rather a disastrous one to the shipping on the eastern coast. The brig Andriette, Sorin Baltyersee,of Drobak, from SundswaIL for London, with timber and deals, grounded on the Cross Sand and soon lost her rudder, boats, asile, &c., from the heavy sa which was running. On the tide flowing, however, she was forced off the sand and brought into Lowestoft in A veay disabled state.

*I.RHAND, (FROM OUR OWN CO%RZSPOND WR1 DUBLIN, SATuRDAY IOENUmG THE MONETrAY CRnsLs The step just taken by the Government towards the easement of the money pressure does not appear to have given general satisfaction this side of the water. The Evening Mail unreservedly condemn the Ministerial panacea, observing - "Baseless speculative trading in Glasgow and the grossest banking mismanagement caused a number of commercial failures in that city, and ultimately the stoppage of twobankslargelywsed btheclass of sma1ldepositor Arun upon other Glasgow ban was theresult, and such apopular commotion aswas sufficientto frighten Lord Palnmerstonfrom his propriety. Not knowing whit else to do, hedetermined, at all events, not to be beaten by Lord John Russeli, and from that determination sprang the letter which it appears was neither suggested nor approved b, the Bauk. The best result we can hope for is that no senous harm may be done - but it is greatly to be regretted that sufficient fim. ness did not remain inthe Treasury counsels to wait a few hours for the turning point towArds which the natural pro. cess of cure was fast advancing". The Bvening Post, on the other hand, eontends that some relaxation had become absolutely necessary, not to uphold coners that ought to suffer for improvidence, but to provide for the requirements of legitimate trade. The remedy adopted in 1847, the Post maintains, was the obvious one to be applied in the present crisis, and adds - " In Ireland, as we have often already stated, and as events have proved, there has becn none of that system of reckless over-trading which has caused so nuch calamity in Englaud and Scotland. Here trade generally is sound, Dlments afe panctual, and mercantile credit was never higber. We use the term 'credit' as a conventional phrase; for' capital is most abundant for all legitimate purposes in Dublin, and there really is less of a credit system than, perhaps, at any former period. Irish capitalists are availing themselves of the high rates of Interest for loans on Government security In England, and investments are so largely made that Government Stock to a considerable amount has been transferred to Ireland even during the last two months. Nevertheless, we rejoice at the symptoms of improvement that have been manifested in England and Scotland since the announcement of the letter of Lord Palmerston, allowing the Bank of England to increase its iesues The panic, now at An end, has been I sbort, sharp, and decisive'-not more tbAn a fortnight in duration in Great Britain, but here we had the opportunity of contemplating its effects at a safe distance from the scene of disaster. Thisis the first time in our history, Perhaps, that Ireland has thus been distingulshed at once for prudence and prosperity. ilready we heave reaped the reward, and hereafter we shall find the advantages of the reputation we have acquired for that sound mercantile credit and prudent conduct of cur banking businees which have so effectualy protected us during the severe commercial crisis of 1857." T HE AOELLOR AND THE ORA0FGFMEN. The Christ Church (Belfast) Protestat Association, headed by the Rev. Dr. Drew, have adopted a series of resolutions menacing Chancellor Brady with cc attainder and loss of fortune, liberty, and life," as the just penalty of the unhappy letter addreseed to the barquis of Londonderry. such, at least, seems tobe the obvious meaning of vhe following resolutions - " Resolved-That the Protestant AssocatIon take notice with much regret of the recent letter of the Lord ChanIcellor. "They resectfnlly plead with that high officer of State, and aslr whether, in his limitation respecting candidates for the mgistracy, he has not outatepped the limits of the British constitution; and, if so, whether there be not historical record for showing that by acts of a similar unlawful kind great functionaries have been subjeoted to attainder and loss of fortune, liberty, and life. "They respeaftfary Inquire if the same high officer of State reject any candidate on alleged and specified opprobrions grounds, at once insulting to said candidate, and injurlous to his position and reputation, whether an action at law wrll not lie against the public defamer of any candidate who belongs toa society of proverbial loyalty and undeniable legality.

STATE OF TRDE. MANCHESTER, Nov. 14. The improved feeling desnibed as prevailing yesterday in thigs market has been quite as marked this mornlng, but very little business was effected. Advice. from Bombay led to sorne inquiry for goods suitable to that market, but tho great reduction In prices within the last few weeks seemed scarcely suffidcent to induce purchases worth naming. In. formation was telegraphed from Liverpool that cotton was again rather mnore in demand and a shade higher in prioe, but this had little or no effect upon buyers of yarn and cloths, who appear indisposed to abandon the cautious policy whilch has guided them for some weeks pest. With nearly the whole of the prodncingpower of the district put on half-time, and ccumulated stocks in the wrehouses even at this restricted rate of productioa, And with the certainty that a better supply of cotton will soon be coming forward, there is a strong inducement to reserve any orders that cannot be executed at very moderate prlces. The depression of cotton was about 2id. per pound up to Thursday on middle classes of American, but a slight reaction has since occurrd, as above Intimated. The depression of yarn varies from about 1.id. per lb. on low numbers te about 2d. and 3d. on some of the higher counts from the highest rates attainable last month. Cloth has caroely suffered so mcLh. One great advantage Manchester has possesd daring thig crisis has been the thorough oonfidenoe exising in the stabiity of its banks. Scarcey a suspicion has been whispered agabnst one of them, and,though some deposlts were rather hastily withdrawn on Wednesday and Thursday, there was nothing deserving the name of "a run," and the Treasury letter to the Bank, published on Friday, restored perfect confidence, even among the more nervous people, who are usually the first to adopt such a rash course in times like the present. BIRMINGHAM, Nov. 14. The iron trade of South Staffordshire, notwithstanding the absence or suspension of American orders, remains steady, and prices are maintained by the first makers. It was to be expected that the present monetarypressure woald cast a gloom over the manufacturing interests of the diatrict, but hitherto credit has been well supported, and whisper has not even hinted a rumour to the disadvantage of any firm in the neighbourhood. It cannot, however, be doubted that the future of the iron trade creates considerable apprehension, and that some of the smaller masters are, to say the least of It, much inconvenienced by the present high rate of discounts. It is ststed that during the next week, in all probability, the stability of needy parties will be severely tried. It is about the period when four months' bills, given at the July quarterly meeting*, become due, and yesterday transactions in them were very beavy. We are happy, however, to state that they were effected stisfactorily, and no defalcations were announced. Now the operations of the Bank Charter Act have for a time been suspended there is, indeed, every reason to believe that the iron distncts will avoid those ruinous embarrassments which have affected other manufacturing communities of the country. The American merchants of Birmingham are doing little or nothing, and foreign trade generally, if that with South Arnerica and Australia is excepted, Is unusually dull. Under such circumstances, the condition of our chief manufactures, if not entirely satisfactory, ti upon the whole a matter of congratulation. The expectations entertained by some, that a reduction in the price of copper would be declared in the course of the present week, have not been realized, and the quotations adopted in August are well supported. The merchants represent that the demand for home consumption is good, and this statement is confirmed by several of our principal manufacturing establishments. The heavy brassfoundries of the towa and neighbourhood, although not working overtime, are in fair work, and only in a very few instances has there been any reduction in the number of operatives employed. The rolling mills, the atate of which indicates at all times the condition of -all branches of brasafoundry. are tolerably busy. Houses engaged in the coppertubeand wire branched have orders in hand which will last them for some months. The tin ware trade continues to be more seriously affected by the suspension of American orders than most other branches, and languor pervades most of our principal mannfactories. Another drop of 61 per ton was declared in Birmingham yesterday, but it is feared that until prices be. oome more settled, and there is a resumption of foreign demands, there will be little improvement in this important branch of local manufacture. The decline In the value of tin it is said wvill act beneficially upon the manufactare of Britannua metal goods; but this branch ts as much Iniluenued at the present period by the monetar pressure of The commercial evellers out upon iourney representing Birmingham houses tLhcugout the country describe the hardware business as languid, but do not speak despondingly, From Scot.and 56varpool orders are extremely Ecanty and remittances scarce, but the ironmongery tra*. in-otner parts of the kingdomn which have Dot iEere from bankfaiuresArenotextraordinarilyflst Order ares n-e out with greab caution, And no disodtion isna oea to increase stooks, but the comparative inactivity which r vaifris dictated more by prudential regard to the f than to any serioas falling off in the retail denamds of t country. The riband and watch trades of Coventry are depres3se1 In the early part of the year they were active, but both branches are now extremely dulL The supension of keurg. Bennoch, Tweatymau, and Co. has inflicted condderable injuy upon the riband manufacture, while the suspension of American orders has completely crippled the watch trade. It so happens, too, that at a period when such a. dispute might lerst be expected a controvery has arisen botwvem the manufacturers of Coventry, bcked by the loal Chamber of Commerce, on the one part, and the London and North-Western Railway Company on the other with respect to the existing rates of insurance sgainst losses sustainedl during the transit of goods upon that' line. The question hau given rise to muc discus. sion among the manufacturers, and, as far as we can learn, theg have been met in a fair and fziendly spizit by the raU vay company. lt wrill be easly understood that the weight of silks and watches conveyed by railway is small compared with their value, and that the charges made for conveyance are consequently tring, whil therisk inerre by the carriers is more thanordiarilyhesyand hazardous. Meetings have been held of the managers of the railwayr company and the Coventry manufacturers, with the view of 6eitleg the question, and it is hoped that it will be speedilarranged. The following is the scale of charges proposed by the-company, and some of the Coventry manufacturers, at we understand, ancnulesce in their fairness:-The value of a. ton of manufactured silk is not les than 2,000!,, and when made up into ribands nearly 4,000.L, the average being about. 3,00CM. The Coventry manufacturers propose 153 sar tos for insurance betweeen that city and London, wale tt. ra t way coapany offer to reduce the rate of carriage by lOe per ton, and charge 20s. per ton for iurnce, leaving the pub. lic to insure or not at their own discretion. The citizenm, however, insist upon the 165. for insuranoe, and in the event. of the London and North-Wesern not cquiescing that the, company shalladd the l5s. to the proposed reduced rate of carnage, and oompel all parties to insure or pay the insur. ance rate The London and North-Western contend that thi public ought to have the power to choose for them. selves. With regard to the inrnoe of watches, a. similar digpute now exists. The company require 6d. as in. urance for every 101, declared value, rrespective of dig. tncee, and when it is conidered that 6d. only is the charge. for cariage of every parcel under Ills weight, whatever it. value, this amount would appear far fromn being unreason. sble. It msy be mentioned that4only one paroel of watches from Coventry has been lost upon the railway duming the. last 11. 7ears. The issue of an additional Amount of Bank of England paper it i stated Is not the only reliesf which the Goven. ment has afforded to Birmingham manufacturers. Instruc. tions have been given, according to a local authority, that. tho utmost despatch should be exercised in examining and assing certificates upon the execution of Government con. trects, that payments may be promptly made, with the vier, as far as posible, of mitigating tho presure of muonetary aflars InBirmingham the outlay in labouris great, and at. times like the present, when the execution of contracts i* extremely urgent, cashlis extremely useful to the contraStorx. NOTTINGEHA3, Nov. 14. The lace trade continues exceedingly depressed, a verr small amount of businesshaving been trausacted during the. week; machinery very generaUj is working short time - much of it indeed, is stopped atogether; the warehouses, also, are working short time, and there has not been so depressed a period in Nottingham for a considerable time. pst Manufacturers are prudently only producing goode. t re actually wanted. The high rate of discount. adopted by the Bank of England has, of course, its inilu. ence upon trade here, and our banks continue to cash bills vhich they consider of a first-rate character. The house of "Steegmannand Co.," lace manufacturers and hosiers, of Nottingham, suspended payment on Wednesday. In the cir. cular issued to the creditors they say that " this position has arisen from the relations of the late firm of Henry Steegmann and Co.(withwhich we wereconnected), inAmerica, and the present monetay crisis in that country." The firm is. an extensive one, but the liabilities have not yet transpired. Yarns are selling for lees money, and very little is doing in silk, prtces being lower. The hosiery trade partakes of the same depreesion as the, lace The factories re working sbort time, and in manyinstances machinery is stopped altogether. The important step taken by Government at the present; crisis appears to have given pretty general satisfaction to the, commercial intereat here. LEICESTEB, Nov. 14. Taking all matters into account, the hosiery trade, as respects the home-market, continues in a satisactory state. Manufacturers continue to produce goods with caution, so as to keep down stocks, and both wools and yarns have a. downward tendency. Worsted spinners continue to work short time. Spealing of the present crisis and its inMuence upon the Leioester trade, the Lcicesatr J'oumca of yesterday states, that- 'Perbaps i no town In England whoes the *ame exent of buui.- new is cxr=led on hba the commercial derangement been les felt than with us, for nowhere hare banks been more carefu oonducted orexercied a ceter cbeek upon over trading. while oar rasnufctuners bays operated only within the bounds of capita, prudence, and caution." LEEDS, Nov. 14. The depression of feeling wlhch seems to pervade the commercial community generally throughout the countryhas been felt more severely here during the past week than prevously, though within the last day or two it bas givem. place to more confidence an to the ultimate Isue of the. Iresext crisis in the lothing distrct. The depresson has en greater thau the circumstances seemd to justify, there. being au almost entire cessation of business, though there has een no attempt even to insinuate that our local trade was unsound, and we can only account for this feeling as the result of the unintermittinganxietT which has pervded& all clases, and which has anticipated consequences. which are fortunately not likely to be realized. No doubt the trade of the town and district has suffered, and there is no reason why we should not look forward to the resumption of business so soon as the pressure has been removed. There has been nothing oing in tho warehousduzing the week, and manufacturers. generally are curtailing their productions; but the suspension of the Bank Charter has excited a rmuch more hopeful tone of feeling; and if we areiiot warnted in anticipating a prosperous winter we are at least justified in prophesing that it will not be a disastrous one. Frac_ ticaL y, It is really astonishing howv little the crisis has hitherto affected this locality, for, though words cf anxiety are on the lips of every one, and short time is. announced in many quarters, the officlalreturn of pauporism for the town of Leeds only shows an increase in outdoor poor of 45 over the corresponding week of last year; while we are assured that the banks are well stocked with money, and that the leading merchabnt in connexion with the. Chamber of Commerce are so satisfied as to the general stability of their trde that they have declined to take part. in any of the movements originated elsewhere for taking measures to secure relief; they are confident that the trade of the district requires no relief other than that which has been granted; and the other day a partner in tbe. eminent banking firm of Williams, Williams, BrownF, and Co. declared that the commercile position of Leeds never etood better, and that it would come out of the present crisis as well, if not better than any other town of equal standing in the country. At thesme time a member of one of the leading firms of the town said that, though Leeds would suffer, it would suffer very little, and sated that one of the principal banks had only had three hbills returned on the Ist of the month, and those only amounted to 531. The measure of relief afforded by the Governmeat is approved both by the lol press and the commercial comnunity generally, and though the business transacted in. the market this morning has shown no improvement, therehas been greaterfirmnessanda rnore hopeful feeling ex- The suspension of the respectable firm of Messrs William. Taylor and Sons, Redbrook Works, Barnaley, is announced Besides being engaged as manufacturers of huksbacLks, dn-bbet, &c., the firm was also connected with bleaching and other works. Their liabUities are said to be considerable, and in the present gloomy state of commercial afftirs fears are entertained that a lawre sacrifice will have to be made by creditors. The firm, which is highly respected and of long standing, intend making a statement of the paition of their affairs next week, until wvhich time it would be premature to give crodenoe to the various statements in circulatiou. HALIFAX, Nov. 14. Busine s here is almost at a standstill. There Is a geFeraladoption of the short time system in the mils, and on F dsy the Messrs. Crossler reduced their establishment tofour days a-week. Other fims have done the sme, with theprospect of a still further reduction. No other alternativeseems open, but it is hoped that there wil be an improvementas soonaskthe pressure of the crisis is over. To-day wool continues depressed, and nothing has been done In, yarns and pieces.

We have been favoured vwith seasonable weathor for the tiLme of year, wbich bas Allo,wed eli kinds of farming operations to be carried on with Vigour. Wheat sowing has been performed under more favour. able circumstanceO than bave been known for several years past, and a very large breadth of wheat has been got in. The eary asown kinds are looking green aud heaIthy. The moist weatber has had a baneful influence on the wheat, a considerable portlon of that brought to markot being out ot condition. Dry frosty weather is much required. At our corn-market the buoyant tone which was observablo in tha wheat tradeo lst week o-uld not be maintained, and the umsettled state of trade and the money.market has had It. effoct on thdi market. Altbough the supplies were liberal for the time of the year, trade was in a very gloomy state, the transactions beiog of the merest retaii character, at sominaUy the same rates sa those o0 lest market. To foroo slea at all holders had to make al aliehiconoession in favour of the buyers, with little diposition on the ;artofthelatter to do buiness. For reaUy good samples former prices were readily obtained, but for inferior kinds aurchasers had th be met with a reduction of is.

ROYAL POLYTXCmNi0 INsTgTuTIoN.-The ls t novelty at this institution is a lecture by Mr. Pepper on the progress of "A Seuttle of Coals from the pit to the fireside," so copiously illustrated by dissolving views ofo agicturesque as well as aientifio kind thAt It almost ap. poces the cha ter ofa "entertainment." Comprehensive as the title may appear, it is less so than the subject of the lecture. Mr. Pepper goes a long way beyond the pit, beginning with those prima,val forests to the combustion of which the coal formations are attributed, next proceeding to the consideration of the fossils that bear marks of their vegetable origin, and then explaining the geological circumstances connected with the discovery of ooal, before he even sets foot in the vehicle that takes him into the region of the modern miner. The account of the "pit" itself is, in fact, a narrative of Mr. Pepper's own descent, and the spectators are not only informed of the whole process by which coal is hewn and brought to the surface, and initiated by means of an illustrative experiment into she mysteries of " downcast and " up.cast," but are, moreover, made acquainted with the peculiarities of subteranean existence, the mniery existing prior to the Earl of Shaftesburs reform being contrasted with the oomparative comfort of the present day. The latter portion of the lecture is devoted to the consideration of firedamp; and here Mr. Pepper introdtces a minute explanation of the "Davy lamp," showing by experiment the virtue of the wire-gauze, and iUustrating the danger of carelessness by a view of the recent explosion in the Lundhill Collery. At last, when his underground work is finished, he brings the whole discouzse to a cheerful conclusion by views of the banquet given by the Marchioness of londonderry to her workmen, and of the London Coal Exchange, this being the nearest approach to the "fireside" capable of picturesque exposition. Altogether this lecture is one of the most amusing and instruotive that has ever been delivered within the walls of the Polysechnic. There is scarcely a fact recorded that is not ilustrated by a picture, or a principle stated that is not elucidated by a diagram, so that if the ears of the spectator refuse to receive the information, which is clearly, eloquently, and sometimes evern humourously given by Mr. Pepper, his eyes can scarcely refuse the intellectual nutriment. MURDER AIND HIGEhWAY ROBSERY.-A most cold-blooded and heartrending murder was commnitted on Friday evening, about 5 o'clock, at Ashover-hill, about five miles from the town of Chesterfield, The place where the murder was perpetrated is not far distant from the residence of the Rev. J. Nodder, whose premises were burglariously entered some months ago. The victim of the diabolical act is a farmer named James Simpson, who has occupied a farm at Ashover under Mr. John Tomlinson, and which is about 25 acres in extent. It was his usnal practice to attend the market at Alfreton, which Is held on a Friday, to dispose of eggs, butter, and other farm produce. On Friday morning last, abous 20 minutes past 10 o'clook, he left his home at Ashover to go to Alfreton, about eight mUes from Ashover, and on this occasion he was to have been accompanied by a farm labourer named George ParneUl, who is in the service of hlr. Tomlinson ; but, as Parnell was busy winnowing, he did not go, and Mr. Simpson proceeded to Alfreton alone, with a bsaket containing abenut 121b. of butter, and 2s. 6d. in silver, which his wife gave him before he started. He was also to have sold two fat pigs. It is believed he left Alfrebon shortly after 3 o'clock-; ana he proceeded along the turnpike road to Higham, passed Ford-house, by H-anley and Dcerleap-school, and it is not known at present whether he was accompanied by any person on the road. Beyond this school he passed the wood belonging to Mr, W. lilnes, which is about 100 yards in extent, to Asbover-hill, which was about half a mile from his owu home. At this point the road is a lonely one, the only houses near being that occupied by Mr. Hopkinson, and another, in which Mr. Bassett resides. At this part of the road Simpson was attacked (it is supposed by some person from the wood), and shot behind the left ear with a pistol or gnu. The shotimusthave been fired close to his head, as the powder had burnt his vwhiskers and blackened the flesh on the left side of the face and neck. The report of firearms was heard, but it excited no alarm, and the murderem would have ten minutes to escape, it being that time after the report had been heard before any person approached the spot. The first person to find the deceased was Mr. Fletcher, of Alton CoUiery, 'who was returning from home to go to his works, when on passing along the road leading from Northedge to Ashover he heard some heavy groans, which increased as he drew near the spot. Soon afterwards a farm labourer named Joseph Marriott came up, and Mr. Fletcher sent him to the house of Mr. Bassett for a light, which was bronuht by Mr. Bassett. They found the deceased laid on his side, with his head in a cart rut, and they turned him over, when Marriott said, " It's Simnson." The man was bleeding profusely from the head. 'They procured a board, and carried him to his home, and Mir. Skidmore, surgeon, of Ashover, was called in, but pronounced life to be boeless. An effort was made to induce the dying man to spea, but he was insensible, and died about 8 o'clock without uttering a word. The surgeon was of opinion that small shot had been fired 4s well as a ball. The wadding was found near the place wbere the deceased lay, and a great quantlty of blood was on the ground. There were no marks of any struggle, and the deceased's clotbes were not torn. His watch and portemonnaie wero stolen, but some articles of grocery which he had purchased were found in his basket unmolested. It is supposed that the murderer mistook the deosed for Mr. Fletchier, who, vas on his way to his colliery to pay his men, and was supposed to have a good sum of money in his possession. Nothing has been heard of the murderer. Tr HoP DUTIES.-Abulky blue book of 400 pages,X published on Saturday, contains the report from the Select Committee of the House of Commonsoon theohop duties. There is no "report," properly so called, the printed matter consisting exclrively of the minutes of evidence. There was, however, considerable discussion in committee on oertain draught reports, and several divisions ensued. There appears to E a much discrepancy between the opinions of tho witnesses, f.or several of the Kent and Sussex growers are of opinion that hop growing is a losing concern, and tbat the excise dn uy isthe prindpalcause of tbeir diffliulties, whereas others, 'und all the growers of the finer kind of hops, have assure, .the committee that hop growing in the long run is a gÂ°od ' nd profitable business A paragraph in the draught repo .t em oying the latter opinion, and declaring that the dut jon hops is (as these growers consider) a positive benefit T tending to restrict cultivation, was agreed to ncm con. T.he chairman, bowever,.was only directed to report the evidenceto the House, The total expense, allowed to Vie witnese amounted to the sum of 584 They were prl-aci. pa u farmers, and somne few brewers.

Here will be seen what was dared and suffered by the brave men to whom we owe deliverance from one of the greatest perils which have ever threatened the Empire. Here we can judge what may be accomplished by a small body of resolute men when they have confidence in their commnanders and when that confidence is justified. The capture of Delhi and the relief of Lucknow are deeds of arms that may well serve as models to future commanders. Every detail of such exploits is interesting, since it shows what ascendancy may be acquired by one race over another, and how [the disproportion of numbers may be balanced by the vigour and heroism which only civilization can impart. Delhi was, as we have already learnt, taken between the 14th and the 21st of September. The little British force was established along a ridge facing the north aide, at a distance of from 1,200 to 1,600 yards. This position was rendered necessary, since the base of our operations was the Puniab. Singularly enough, the ancient city of the MoNuis was not attacked by a force supported and supplied by the capital of British India, but by the most recent conquest of our arms in the North-West. The enemy were in possession of a city which, though certainly not a first-class fortress, was yet strongly fortified by art, while its natural position made it well capable of holding out if garrisoned by defenders reasonably brave and skilfuL Such were the chances against a successful assault of the place that the British Generals-whom subsequent experience proves not to have been wanting in boldness-chose rather to rest on the defensive for months, though the resistance of Delhi was a most powerful encouragement to revolt, than risk their army and the national honour in an attack) which might he unsuccessful. At last the siege train arrived, it was known that no further reinforcements were to be expected, and preparations were accordingly made for the assault. The British force seems to have been even less than was previously supposed. It amounted to (6,500 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 600 artillery-Europeans and natives. Of this force, little over 8,000 men, probably less than half were Europeans. Still it was necessary to attack the city and its .25,000 defenders with this handful of men. How this was done is recounted in another place. On the i'th of September operations commenced. During the next three days batteries were traced, completed, and armed, [in spite of a sharp fire of musketry and a storm of shot aud shell. The Sepoys opposed our progress with a skdll which shows how much they have profited by our military instruction during their long term of service. For instance, we are told that " the enemy went to work to-night, and "made an advanced trench parallel to our left "attack and about 350 yards from it, from which "at daybreak they opened a very hot fire of "musketry, which was maintained during the rest "of the siege; they had prexiously got some light "guns and one heavy gun out into the open "on our right, which caused considerable an- noyance by their enfilade fire." We seem to be reading of TODTLxBEN and the- Russians when we come to such details of military science; and the narrative serves to show how wily and how dangerous are these AsiaMc tigers, who have been so long fawning on us. On the 11th our batteries opened, andW by the next day 50 gunS and mortars were pouring a continuous hail of shot and shell into the city. For three days the fire contioued, night and day; but even then the stubborn spirit of the mutineers did not give way. Though unable to fire from their bastions they sent out guns into the open,-" got a gun to bear " from a hole broken in the long curtain wall, " sent rockets from one of their Dlartello towers, " and maintained a storm of musketry from their "advanced trench and from the city wall." But; wlen things came to close quarters, then the difference between European and Aniatic made itself known. On the 14th the amault was made. We need not recapitulate the incidenta of. this eventful day, but we may call attention to the devoted courage of Lieutenant SAIKELD and his comrades who formed the party which blew open the Cashmere-gate. Never was the YVrIOaR CrOSS better merited than by thix most gallant officer and his companions in heroism. General bTxc,jx, sox then formed his troops and led on the fit column. In advanciDg towards the Lahore-gate he met the wound which has terminated his noble career at the early age of 35. Three of the columns were succesful; the fourth, unfortunately, miscarried. On the 14th the British lost 61 officers and 1,178 men killed and wounded. Yet the city was not to be won in a day. For sixc days more the enemyfought from street to street and from house to house. On the 17th our batteries commanded the bridge, the Selimghur, and the Palace, which were kept under an incessant fire of shells. The mutineers, with a coolness worthy of GoRTscAxoPF, came to the conclusion that the town could not be held, and accordingly sent off their baggage, with a determination to follow when it had gained a fair start. The towns_ people took refuge in the Palace or began to fr the city. Great numbers of the people came into the districts occupied by our troops, and were passed out of the town unhurt. Streams of people and animals also poured out from the Ajmere-gate. This strange ex:odus is one of the most striking things in the history of warfare. A few days later the city is described as absolutely void of inhabitants. Houses bazaars,mosques,weretenantless, andeverything left as at the moment of depariture. The capital of Mussulman India, vwith its 150,000 inhabitants, was changed tothe aspect of Pompeii, or those doomed cities of Arabian fable where the God of I&HozET turned a whole race of idolaters into stone. By the 19th great bodies of the mutineers had effected their escape. A remnant, however, stood their ground, and on this day, the fifth after the great assault, they actually got a field piece behind a breastwork and opened fire upon us, of course without much effect. The act, however, shows the obstinacy of the resistance, since, two days before the great body of the guns, numbering 226, had been recaptured, and there was not the slightest chance of holding the place. On the 20th, by 5 o'clock in the evening, the struggle was over. The whole city, the Palace, the Jumma musjid, or great mosque, the Selimghur, anud the bridge were in our possion. The mutineers seem then to have been struck with a panic, for they deserted their camp outside the Ajinere-gate, Ieaving their clothing, bedding, cooking utensils, and other necessaries behind them. So ended this momentous contest. The number of men by 'whom the city was assaulted was, indeed, disproportionately small, and on the principle that "the fewer men the greater share " of honour," they deserve all that can be said in their praise. From Delhi we must now turn to Lucknow. The operations coincided in time vwith the capture of DelHi. On the 19th Sir mN-RY HAVELOCE crossed the Ganges on a bridge of boats. The movement was not an hour too soon, for it was known that at Lucknow all supplies would be exhausted on the 24th. MIoreover, as our readers are aware, the works were found to have been mined, and in a few days more the garrison would have been at the Sepoys' mercy. We will not here describe the skill and couraga and opportuneness of the advance, but we would call attention to an incident -which seems to belong rather to the age of FROISSART than to that of Alini6 Rifles and scientific war. Sir JrEs OuTRAX was superior in rank to General H.xaLoci;, but, far from superseding him, Sir JAmas publishes an order appointing that gallant officer to the command of the force for the relief of Lucknow ; and, accompanying the army in his civil capacity, tendera his services to General HAvELocn as a volunteer. Nor was this an empty compliment or an unmeaning profession, for Sir JA-iis OUT'rxA, charging at the head of the volunteer cavalry, captured two of the four guns which were the trophies of the first day'x success. Such proofs of high and courteous feeling among brother officers give the soldier's character its highest charms. Lucknowr was eventually relieved, although we learn that, owing to the number of the sick and helpless, the garrison could not be brought away. It must, therefore, still remain under the command of its gallant chief, Colonel L'-GLIS, of the 32d. This officer, whose wife (the daughter of Sir F. ThESIGEn) and three children are shut up with the little force in the Residency, has, we believe, had the chief command during the greater part of the siege. We trust le may be spared with the rest of his gallant associates for suitable rewards in.. their native land. Such is the outline of the military news brought by the last mail. One character is impressed on all we hear of this desperate contest. It is the noble conduct of the officers in command and the devoted courage of the men. The country has, we all feel, repaired its renown, which was for a while wounded by the episode of the Crimea. We have now shown the world that we have Generals who can command, as well as soldiers who can go boldly to danger and to victory. The men who became notorious two or three years since may row be consigned to a contemptuous oblivion. In the triumph of new achievements the country has forgotten the disasters that are past.

IND I AG CAPTURE OF DELHI A"F 'RELIEF OF LUCKiNOW. BENGAL. [Part Of the following appeared in our second editioa ~Of Satna. .-- (FROEr OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. "CALCUTTA, CCT. 8. "The transactions of the fortnight are not 'very complicated, but it is vain for me in this aetter to enter into minute details. I shalI 'do you and yotar readers a more acceptable service by a general sketch of the position "of affairs. And, first, for Calcutta. The panics Which for some months past have periodically distracted the metropoliB seem at last to be over. The Shaunon,theBe Bllele the Sanspareil, and the Pearl, with four armed steamers, are anchored off the ltownm They could destroy it in two hours. that little fact is perfectly appreciated both by eative and European, and the one Is there'lore quiet and the other contented. The volunteers, ':00 in nurnber, are regularly drilled, and the seamen ancd marines would like nothing so much as an emeute. The King of Oude is in the fort, and, though Government has not proof positive of his 'complicity in the insurrection, it is well aware that Calcutta would approve his execution. At BarZackpore, the metropolitan cantonmeent, three disarmed regiments are watched by 200 Europeans 'They are not quiet, but they are frightened, and well aware that the slightest movement will be the gnal for their destruction. The capital, therefore, may be conmidered safe, but trade has diminished at least one-balf. The money-market is un. precedentedly tight, and merchants are gloomily 'hinting at a pos5ibility which, having a due respect for the libel law, I prefer reporting privately. Beyond Barrackpore al becomes vague and indefinite till we reach the frontier of Behar. There is no one point of interest on which the mind can conmentrate its attention ; aU facts are lost in the rumours iD which they are enveloped'; Government Inowvs little, and publishes less, and the press is for -practical purposes extinct. It is not even in some places easy to distinguish the movement of troops. The Transgangetic portion of Bengal Proper is stiU perfectly secure, there being few Sepoys, and the DIussulman population remaining suspiciously quiet. In the provinces on the other side tome Zemindars, with dacoit bands, are giving trouble. Colonel Fisher, with one wing of Her Majesty's 53d, and -Colonel Berkeley with the other, are cleansing the valley of the Soane the best way they can. Captain Oakes, with a few Europeans and Sikhs, holds down Puruha. Captain :Rattray, with a strong Sikh -corps, is traversing the hill tracts beyond the Soane. -Colonel Grey, with 200 Europeans and 200 Madrassees, watches Dinapore, and, though last, not least, the Kamptee column of 3,000 Europeans and Mladrasseea has on the extreme west saved -Jubbulpore. All these bands have accomplished something in the fortnight. Captain Oakes has defeated Kookur Cooma, a Santal, who now leads the prisoners released by the Ramghur battalion at Hazareebagh. His position, however, is still one of considerable difficulty. It is considered probable that the Coles will rise when their harvest is gathered in, and in that case Captain Oakes will be enveloped, and will require the aid of Madras troops, if not of Europeans. The Ramghur battalion, whose mutiny was reported by the last mail, was puraued and defeated by Colonel Fisler, with the loss of four guns and 45 cartloads of ammunition. The remnant are believed to have joined the ,th Irregulars, but their subsequent movements are stiUl uncertain. The three regiments who mutinied at Dinapore, or rather the remainder of them vwho escaped from Major Eyre at Arrah, traversed ithe Rewah district, and remained in the neighbourhood of Jubbulpore for some days. Their' presence emboldened the 52d Native Infantry at Jubbulpore to revolt. They left the station with their arms, intending to effect a junction with the Dinapore men, but were met on the road by the Kamptee column,attacked,and defeated with the loss of 125 men. A few who were taken prisoners were executed on the spot. This saved Jubbulpore, and the victory carries with it an indirect result of the last importance. The 52d was thrashed by Madrassees. The ill-feeling between the two armies, always great, is now conlirmed, and the fidelity of 4he Madras Army secured by victory. In Assam there are two Light Infantry battalions, both of which have exhibited a mutinous spirit, The planters have taken refuge in Gowhatty and Debrooghur, but the province is totally defenoeless, the only European force being 100 policemen sent up from Calcutta. The Government is now endeavouring to enlist the men of Cachar, but without much success. Passing beyond the Kurmunassa, we find the whole of the B3undelcund territory in a state of disorganization, the chiefs having taken up arms. WVith the exception, however, of the Ranee of .Thansi, they have not as yet declared against the Europeans, and -will of course ultimately side with the strongest. " The native belief that this side will be the Sepoys' begins everywhere to waver. Delhi has really fallen, and, though the accounts which have reached Calcutta are few and meagre, enough remains to sbow that the conquest is complete. The loss of the British bas been very heavy, 1,100 killed and wounded, making 3,600 since the commencement of the siege. The troops are said to have behaved admirably. The Europeans stormed the magazine blown up by Lieutenant Willoughby with such a cheer, that the mutineers, probably ten times their own strength, fied without a shot. General Nicholson was terribly wounded, but refnsed to be carriedl from the field, and is since reported dead. It is to him we owe the fall of Delhi, for it was he who, after con4ributing in no slight degree to the security of the Puinjab, brought down the reinforcements. A atrong column under Colonel Greathed started in pursuit of the fugitives; but they will, in all probability, escape to Oude. " There General Havelock has executed a brilliant march, and has relieved Lucknow. On the 19th September he crossed the river at Cawnpore with 2,70r0 men, Sir James Outram, with most oreditable mastnanimity, surrendering the command to his able subordinate. He himself commanded the volunteer cavalry, of whom about a hundred have reached Cawnpore. G-enerals Neill and Hamilton led -the two brigades, one containing the bth Fusileers, Taer Majesty's 84th,the Madras Fusileers, and some light Artillery; the other, the 78th Highlanders, Her Majesty's 90th, the Ferozopore Regiment (Slkhs),and some Artillery. Oi the 20th General Havelock -received his heavy baggage and 18 guns, but no tents. On the following day the enemy, who were strongly posted across the road, were attacked and driven back with the loss of four guns. Two were takenby General Outram him selfwhose cavalry sabred 120 of the enemy. On the same day the in. defatigable General executed a march of 20 miles, and on the following one of 14, driving the enemy back upon Lucknow with the loss of all their gpunaOa the 24th s oalute aunounced to the heroic garrison the prospect of relief, and on the 25th the relieving force entered Lucknow. Step by step they Cllt their way to the Residency. It wag time; the besiegers had run two mines, which in three hours would have laid the defences open to a rusb from the whole of the rabble collected round the city. The batteries still continued to play upon the building, and in carrying them by storm General Neill was killed, a loss which almost outbalaluces the victory. The following are the General Orders issued in Calcutta:- THE RE-CAPTURE OF DELHI. "NOTIFICATION. "No. 1,237 of 1857. " Fort William, Oct. 2. "The Right Ron. the Governor-General in Council has received, by a telegraphic message, the gratifying announcement that Delhi is entirely In the hands of Major-General Wilson's army. "Delhi, the focus of the treason and revolt which for four months have harassed Ilindostan, and the stronghold in which the mutinous army of Bengal has sought to concentrate its power, has been wrested from the rebels. The Kiog is a prisoner in the palace. The head-quarters of Major-General Wilson are established in the Dewan Kha3. A strong column is in pursuit of the fugitives. " Whatever may be the motives and passions by whioh the mutinoua soldiery and those who are leagued with them bave been inetigated to faithlessness, rebellion, and crimes at wbich the heart sick-ens, it is certain that they have found encouragement In the delusive belief that India was weakly guarded by England, and that before the Government could gather together its strength against them their ends would be gained. They are now undeceived. "Before a single soldier of the many thousands who are hastening from England to uphold the supremacy of the British power has set foot on these shores, the rebel force, where it was strongest and most united, and where it had the command of unbounded miUitary appliances, has been destroyed or scattered by an army collected within the l2mits of the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab alone. " The work has been done before the support of those battalions which have been coUected in Bengal from the forces of the Queen in China and in Her Majesty's Eastemn colonies could reach Major General Wilson's army; and it Is by the courage and endurance of that gallant army alone, by the skill. sound judgment, and steady resolution of its brave commander, and by the aid of some native chiefs true to their allegiance, that, under the blessing of God, the bead of the rehellion has been crushed, and the cause of loyalty, humanity, and rightful authority vindicated. "The Governor-General in Council hopes that the receipt of despatches from Major-General Wilson wldl soon place it in his power to make known the details A the operations against Delhi, and to record, fully and publicly, tha thanks and commendation which are due to the officers and men by whose guidance, courage, and exertions those operations have been brought to a succeful Issue, " But the Governor-General in CounCl wil not postpone till then his gratefulacknowledgmentof the serviceswhich have been rendered to the empire, at this juncture, by the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab. "To Sir John Lawrence, .CC.B., it Is owing that the army before Delhi, long ago cut off from all direct support from the Lower Provinces, has been constantly recruited and strengthened so effectually as to enable its commander not on'y to bold his position unshaken, but to achieve comn plete success. " To Sir John Lawrence's uncoasing vigilance, ana to his energetio and judicious employment of the trustworthy farces at his own disposal, it is due that Major-General Wilson's army has not been hased or threatened on the side of the Punjab, aud that the authority of the Govern. ment in the Punjab itself has beesn stained and generally respected. "The Governor-General in CouncU seizes with pleasr the earliest opportunity of testifying his high appreciation t.f these great and timely services. " By order of the Right Hon. the Governor-General of IndiA in Council. " R. J. E. BIRCH, Colonel, "Secretary to the Government of India, in the Military Department." TIHE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW. " NOTIFICATION. "No. 1,238 of 1857. " Fort Wilam, Oat. 2. "The Governor-General in Council rejoices to announce that informnatlon has been this day received from Major. General Sir James Oatram, G.C.B., showing that the Reidency at Lucknow -was in the possession of Mdajor-General Hlavelock's Force on the 25th ult., and that tho garrison is saved. " Rarely has a commander been so fortunate as to relieve by his success so many aching hearts or to reap so rich a reward of gratitude as will deservedly be offered to MajorGeneral Havelook and his gallat band wherever their triumph shall become known. " The Governor-General in Counoil tenders to Sir James Outram and to Major-General Havelock his earnest thanis and congratulations upon the joyful result of which a mer ciful Providence has made them the chief instruments. " The Governor-General in Council forbears to observe further upon information whioh is necessarily imperfect but he cannot refrain from expreslng the deep regret with which he hears of the death of Brigadier-General Neill, of the Ist Madras European Fusileers, of which it is to be feared that no doubt exists, "Brigadier General NeiUl, during his short but active carer in Bengal, had won the respect and oonfidence of the Government of India; he had made himself conspicuous as an intelligent, prompt, self-reliant soldier, ready of resource and stout of heart; and the Governor-General in Council offers to the Government and to the army of Madras his sincere condoleace upon the lose of one whowas au honour to the servico of their presidency. "By order of the Governor-General of Indla In CounciL " R. J. H. BBCH, Colonel, "Secretary to the Government of India, in the "Militar Depakrtent." CC Delhi, then, has fallen, but I would wan your readers most earnestly not to believe that the revolt is therefore over. The fall of the city is important to our prestige, and may be injurious to the morale of the rebel forces, but the physical strength of the revolt is almost unimpaired. The greater number of the mutineers in Delhi must have escaped. There is no cavalry to send after them, and natives under all circumstances outmarch troops led by Europeans. The force in Delhi has been much reduced, and cannot be very speedily reinforced. The battle-field will probably be transferred to Oude. General Havelock's splendid march on Lucknow saved the Europeans imprisoned there, but he is too weak-handed to effect more. It is doubtful even if he will succeed in reaching Cawnpore. He is hemmed in by a force which cannot number less than 30,000 men, with all the communications in their hands, an amazing number of cannon, plenty of provisions, and the sympathy of the Mussulman population. There are no troops to send to his aid, and he designs, it is said, to leave a small garrison in Luck. now, and cut his way with the remainder back to Cawnpore. Round that station, again, the Gwalior mutineers are said to be concentrating; but this report, like most others, requires confir- mation. At present they are threatening Agra. In truth, notwithstanding the fall of Delhi, all we can hope to do is to maintain our ground until the English reinforcements a=rive. They cannot be here in force till November. They wil then be transported in steamers and by immense bullock trains to Allababad, whence strong columns, under Sir Colin Campbell, will sweep through the North-west and Oude, reconquering the provinces as if they had never been in our possession. Thbi movement cannot be commenced till the 2d of December, and till then I have not a hope of reporting the approach of permanent tranquillity. Meanwhile difficulties not yet described in your columns are thickening round us. " The greatest of these difficulties is the position of the Government of India as respects the Europeans. The revolt, wholly unexpected as it was, at first rather stupefied than appalled the dominant race. For a fortnight mutiny after mutiny, atrocity after a:rocity, found them still slumbering on in a strange security; and then, as it seemed, in an hour, all over India the European community awoke. The great white aristocracy, which has governed India for a hundred years, and whose very existence as a body seems half forgotten in England,, displayed that terrible energy whioh is so ftequentl,1 imparted y tbe pride, of rawc. In many diatri.t3 dewn'bed, but appare;tly incormetly, as of the 12th lregular Cavalry. Lord Canning does justice to General Neil in the proolamation which I enecle. The latest memage which man discover as emanating from Cawnpore states that on the day following that of the relief advances were making upon the city; that the 'right quarter' in our posesEilon, that seven guns had been taken, that the enemy were deserting the city by thousands, and that the late King's sons had fled to Fyzabad. I have heard of a native report as late as the 4th init., to the effect that Sir James Outram (this I believe is true) was sdightly wounded, and that the Europeans were going that day to have a great dinner at the Residency to celebrate their sucoess. Naturally, the country between Lucknow and the river is at present disturbed, but we shall Boon, no doubt, have fuller accounts from Cawn. pore. "F From Benarea we hear of the arrival at that station of Captain Peel with his naval brigade, and also of the Ghoorkas with the treasure from Goruokpore. The 93d Highlanders and the Miltary Train mounted on the horses of the 8th Madras Cavalry, and equipped like a Light Cavalry regiment, left Oalcutta for the Upper Provinoes in the last week of September, and must be well up in Behar by this time. Writing of the Ghoorkas just now, I should not have omitted an action near Azlmghur, in which 1,000 of these mnen (Nepal auxiliaries, be it remembered), led by English offioers, carried an insurgent village at the point of the bayone' in splendid atyle, capturing the three guns which defended it. To return, however, to Behar, there has been nothing to cause disquiet save in the very uncertain movements of the mutinied 5th Irregular Cavalry. These men appear to have got across the river Soane near Sasseram, to the eastward of Chunarghur, and to have joined one Oomer Singh, a brother of Koor Singh, and himself a marauding leader of some note. Colonel Fisher, with part of the Madras brigade from Raneegunge, Is supposed to have crossed the river on their track. The Dinapore mutineers, with Koor Singh's people, and probably the soldiery of the IRajah of Rewah, have, it is feared, got as far up the country as Banda, to the westward of Alhabad and north of Bundelcund. Ia connexion with them is again brought into notice the detested name of Nana Sahib-not Nena, as, owing I suppose to an indistinctness in my writing, it appers In your columns You may see a report that Nana Sahib was wounded in an encounter with Havelock's force in Oude. But there seems reason to suppose that he is not in Oude at all. Thee are nine or more Richmonds in the field. On the authority of his own cousin, lately arrested near here, and a Brahmin friend of that cousin and of himself, it may, I suppose, be announced with some certainty that the Nana has several men in various places with the rebels dressed like himself, and bearing his name. He himself, as I have said, is probably not in Oude. By information which I know to come from Scindia in person at Gwalior, he has an agent at Moorar, the cantonment of that city, endeavouring to incite the mutinied contingent, hitherto, as I have before written, held in check by the Maharajah, to join the rebels at Banda under his leadership. He himself, according to the same authority, is or at least was thought to be, when on the 5th and 6th inBt. the information left Gwalior, at Jaloun, some 70 miles to the eastward of Scindia's capital. If the projected movement is effected, the Nana will have at his disposal a large body of disciplined mutineers, and whether he cross into Oude or, stil worse, move downwards into Bundelcund, he may yet do us much mischief. Agra-where Mr. Colvin's successor is Captain Fraser, of the Engineers -he in not in the present state of things lkely to attempt. It would be satisfactory to believe that the reward of 50,000 rupees said by a Calcutta paper to have been placed upon the head of this miscreant is likely to lead to his speedy apprehension. " The Indore and Mhow mutineers were, as I have already mentioned, still at Dholpore when last heard of. Holkar's territories are disquieted by the threatened presence of Rohilla, and other mercenaries, nominaUy iu the pay of the petty Rajabs of Dhar and Anjhera, who have been plundering and burning in the neighbourhood of these towns and at Bhopawur. But for these troublesome neighbours the Bombay colnmn at Mhow was on the point of advancing to Indore. Now, however, on the report of a movement by the marauders to the southward, the main body of the column holds fast, while a troop of Dragoons (14th) with two guns aDd a wing of the 25th Native Infantry fals down the road to the river as far as Manpoor. The preservation of the line of the Nerbudda, the prevention of all disorderly persons from crossing to its southern bank and thus entering the Deccan or Candeish, is of great importance. It is with this same view that a party of the 28th Madras Native Infantry has moved down the river from Hoshungabad to prevent a body of loose plunderers from crossing at Hindia, or to destroy them if they have crossed. The column of the Hyderabad contingent from Edlabad has also crossed the Taptee and advanced to the Nerbudda, and it is probable that the Bombay flying column of dragoons, guns, and infantry will be pushed forward to Mhow from Aurungabad, where the resident at Hyderabad says he has no longer any need for them. In the Saugor and Nerbudda territories there is cause for anxiety. The fort at Saugor is in a perilous position, alone in a hostile country, with a garrison of only 123 fighting men, with nearly 200 women and children and a large arsenal to protect. The Madras column, as I wrote in my last, has been forced by the mutiny of the 52d at Jubbulpore to fall back for the protection of that important station. On its way it came upon the 52d, drawin up to oppose its passge. The guns were brought to the front, and the mutinous regimeat soon broke and fled, with the loss, it is said, of 150 killed.

THBE LAST SCENE OF THE PERSIAN WAR The following is an extract from a letter dated Rushire, September 30:- " We are now at the close of the last Persian expeditionary scene of 1856-57, all our force having departed for India, with the exception of a wing of a native regiment and the General (Brigadier-General John Jacob) and his party, who possibly may embark to-morrow and sadl on Saturday. A portion of the Persian force intended to occupy Bushire on our departure is on its way in, and on arrival the Persian flag wiU be rehoisted under a salute of 21 guns from an Indian navy vessel of war, the 8rmo number of guns being returned by the Persians in honour of our Queen and in acknowledgment of the compliment. The townspeople and inhabitants in the neighbourhood are generally very sorry to lose us, for a more orderly camp or better behaved troops than those so long located at Bushire have been could not be conceived. Ddalers in everythiDng have been scrupulously padd, and at their own prices, and justice hba been rendered to all of every degree. Of course the Per. sian lieges regret us under such circumstances, but we leave a good name behind us, and they must hold a bigher opinion of British power and resources than was formerly the case, when they had no means of judging of them to so full an extent."
TO THE BDITOR OF TH& TIIMES. Sir,-In referenco to your report of the proceedings insti. tuted in Marlborough-street office of police against my servants yesterday, although aware of the difficult task I have to perform, lest by possibility I might saa anything which would appear disrespectful to a court of justice, I cannot refrain from expressing my convictioa that a policeman dressed in plain clothes as a detective was not justified in waiting until my family and myself had entered our car. riage before pUtting in force his authority. i feel assured, myself, that my coachman rwas not drunk, and had only endeavoured to discharge the duty in which he was then e"gaged. It is not unfrequently the caso to make charges against others of offences of which parties are themselves guilty, and, as I also feel that a very great outrage has been committed oat my family and myself by the detective policeman in plain clothes, I have felt it my duty to write to Sir Richard Mayne, requesting an investigation into his conduct. I am. Sir. vonrhoAin,t c.", ARCHIBALD MACOLANE IC r! R n__ Colonel 52nd Light Iafaatti. 13, Ctumberland-street, Hyde-park.

LAW BEPORT. COURT OF CHANcEY. laxcoT'A.rn,. Nnv 1-t THE PREFERENCE SHAREHOIE3RS OF THE GHEAT 2TORTHERN RAILWAy C03PANY (HllRY AND OTHERS) V. THE GREAT NORTlERNT RATLT.WAY onn>v (Bcfore tag LORD CM&NOELLOR and the LOB;DS JU1TIOCS gv A -. , IL Tnis pa t-heard appeal from a decree of Vice-ChanceUor Wood, relating to the rights of preference shareholders, and which has been fully reported in The Times, wu this mornm ing resumed. lr. DAmr having ccncluded his reply, The LORD CH'CELLOR said the question was one of the greatest importance to a very large namber of shareholders, not only in this, but in other companies. It would be therefore desirable to dispose of the question once for all, and to settle the rights generally of all preference shareholders. He had given his best attention to the arguments, and must say that he thought he had satisfied his mind as to what ought to be the decison i the case. As, however, the issue was one of suoh grave importance, and thejadgment would have a bearing upon so many dmilar cases, he was of opinion, with the Lords Justioes, that it would be better to give the matter a little more consideration; the case would therefore stand ia the paper for judgment on Saturday next. WARDEN V. JONES The arguments in this part-hward appeal from the Marter of the Rolls were, then proceeded with. The suit was instituted by a creditor of a person named Barnett to set adde a poss-nuptial settlement made by him of his wife's railway stock, in pursuance of a parol agreement entered into before marriage. The plaintiffs debt was owing at ths time the agreement was made. The Mfaster of the Rolls held, with regret, that the settlement was not a valid and subseting instrument, and declared it void against prior exit|g Wcreditors. From this decision the wife and her brother, who had lent her 2504. on the railway shares, appealed. hlr. R. PALnRx and Mr. S. SIesTas opened toe plaintiff's case, as it was an appeal from the whole decree Mr. LLOYD and Mr. LANGWORTRY, for the appellants, contended that the settlement ought to be upheld, both on the ground that there was a moral obligation on the hasband to make it, and that there had been part performance of a parol agreement, which took the case out of the Statute of Frauds. The LonD CIANCZLLOR reserved his judgment, (Before the LonDs JusTimE OF APPEA,) BIRCH V. SEWELL. Their Lordehips, after having sat with the Lord Chancellor until the middle of the day, proceeded with the further hearing of this case. The appeals are from orders of Vice-Cbancellor Stnart, and the object of each party is to vary certificates of the chief clerk. The facts are wholly uninteresting. Mr. Malins and Mr. F. S. Wiliams are counsel on one side; Mr. Wigram and Mr. G. F. Smith appear on the other side.
VICE&CHBANOLLORR' CTTRT, .n- it IN RE THE IRISH WASTE TANDq 7%flnfr- C- (Before tce-C7uanceltor Sir R. T. KmnrpTir;v I Mir. liasse and Mr. W. D. Lewis appeared upon a titlion in this matter, the object being to wind up the affa.rs of this concern. The company was projected previously to and carried on business until the year 1850. It was to consist of 10,000 shares of 601. each, of which, however, 2,015 only were subscribed for and allotted, and some of those were forfeited. Seven calls of 12C. each had been made, in addition to the original deposit of 1I., and the remainder were unappropriated. The company had an office in St. Mildred's-court, in London, and meetings had taken plaoe up to 1852; and in 1849, alt a general meeting held on the 27th of February, it was resolved that a committee of three members should wind up the affairs. Various proceedings had taken place under that resolution, and .al the estates belonging to the company, as lessees, had been dealt with except one, called the Glene sk estate, of which the rent being In arrear an action of ejectment was brought against the company by the landlord, and finaljudgment was entered against them. Certain of the shareholders had contributed' in unequal proportions to these proceedings, and 160 were now liable tothe debt due for rent, whieh amounted to 2,6417 18s. 10d. Apetition to wind up the company had been presented before the Mster of the Rolls in Ireland, and no order was made, wlthoutprejudice to a similar petition being again presented. The present petitioner, Mr. Dredge, of Liverpool, held 240 shares. The YICP CHAxeELLOR made the order. SELBY V. PFRAZER. This biUl was filed by Jane .elby, who, on the death of her brotber, John Charles Selby, had carried on the business of an army and navy tailor, since June, 1854, at Portsea. The object of the suit was to obtain relief against Roderick Frazer and John Davis, formerly cutter-out and book-keeper to her brother and herself, in respect of alleged unfair dealing in getting arway custom from the plaintiff by means of the knowledge their former position enabled them to gain. It appeared that the plaintiff was legatee from her brother of the business in question, and a letter was extant whereby the testator's intention appeared to have been to make some arrangement in favour of Frazer, and that his sister might not carry on the business alone, and after his death attempts were made to arrange something between the parties, but without success, and the result was that Frazer and I Davis suddenly left and opened a shop in the immediate vicinity, aUleging that certain new parties being employed by the plafntiff was a breah of an understanding then sub. sisting. What the plaintiff now complained of then took place-namely, certain customers of the old fiim became customers of the defendants, by means, as was alleged, of representations made by them which induced such persons to employ them. The cause now came to a hearing, aud a great de. of evidence had been gone into with reference to the circumstances attending the alleged getting away of customers, and the defendants had been examined and allidavits made. What was now asked was that the defendants might be restrained from soliciting the custom from persons who had employed the original firm while they were in such employ, from using measures obtained from the plaintiff's establishment, or doing any act whereby the intiff might be injured. The defendants admitted solicit. g custom, but denied having done so except in the ordinary course of trade, nor had they used measmres obtained whi e in the plaintiff's service, having made clothes for some customers from memory of the measures. Mr. Bagshawe and Mfr. CottreUl appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Batly and Mr. W. W. Cooper for the defendants. The VICE-CHAICELLOB, without calling upon the defen. dants' counse, said that from an early period of this case he had entertained an impression, which had strengthened as It proceeded, that It could result in nothing but a dismissal of the bill, and the only question was reaUl as to costs. AU that counsel's ingenuity could suggest had been brought forward, but the case was an entire failure. His Honour then referred in detail to the various branches of relief rayed, and observed that it was perfectly lawful, however Ealhonourable and discreditable, for an individual in the employ or service of another, after quitting such service, to induce customers of hls former employer to becomehis own; iprimd facie that was dishonourable and discreditable, but it was cLear that this Court could not interfere to prevent it. The obligation might be moral, but it was not legal On the other hand, where a knowledge was acquired of matters which the employer had a right to keep secret from the world, whether trade books, &c., th're was no right to make known such secret to others. The plain. tiff had wisely abstained from pressing for a great deal of the relief asked, but an inquiry was asked whether the defendants had executed any orders intended for the plaintiff. If that had been alleged and proved, or even their intention so to do, she would have been entitled to an injunction. The other thing asked was to restrain from soliciting custom, on the plea that the defendants had the measures of the customers whether the Court would grant that was questionable. As to the inquiries, there was nothing approaching an allegation, and that alone was conclusive. His Honour then referred to two cases of Lieutenant Thompson and Mrs. Markham which were relied on, and said that the first was a bond fllde order to Frazer, although also given to the plaintiff. the second only alleged that some other person aUeged that Davig had written, &c. The rules of pleading were founded on good sense, and that which decdied that such an allegation must fail was not a mere technicality. It was said that the defendants did not possess the measures, and that when they represented that they had them the repesentati vras a flsebood ; this was very unsatisfactory. This cuae did not come within the cases cited, and,although the plaintiff's conduct in meditating bringing other persons into her employ might be some palliation of what the defendants had done, and their conduct might be shabby, et, as she had en. tirely failed in her case, the biU must be dismissed with costs, MOOEHEOUSE V. COLVrN This was a supplemental suit to the suit of "Lordv. Colvin," which has been so often before the public, and which involves so large an amount of property under the will of the late Peter Cochrane. The object is that the present suits may not be heard until the disturbances at Lucknow Feruckabad, and Cawnpore, in India, have been suppressed, so that certain native evidence might be adduced, and for reading other evidence. This bill was demurred to. of h de.. and Mr. E. F. Smith appeared in support (Before VChanceUor Sir W. P. WOOD.) IN TEE MATTrR OF STADISn'S SETTLE D ESTATZS AND OF THE CARLISL,E and siLLoTYi BAY RAILwAy AmD DOCK ACT, 1854. This was a petition by the Lord of the Manor of Holme Cultram, in the county of Cumberland, for payment of a isum of maoney which had been paid into court by the CharislUe andS iloth Bay Railway and Dock Company, in respect of a portion of the sea shore at Sioth, on the Solwa Frith, between high and low water mark, taken by thee comany, thoetitioner claiming the money on the ground that the land t ein was of the manor of Holme Cultram. By a Royal grant daJted the 29th of April, 1693, and enrolled the 16th of October, 1706, King Willam And Queen MarY granted the manor of Holme Cutrm wt the rights, members, and appurts Itbreo, wththe site of the manor and the late moonastery, with the demesne lands, and all the salmnon fishery withinL the lordship of Seyton, in the county of Cumnberland, &c.. and all their Majestiee' estate, right, title, interest, claim, and demand whatsoever, of, in, and unto the said premises, excepting all mines royal of gold or siver within th esaid manor, being or to be found, and adl Ererogatives thereunto belonging. The petitioner derived is tle under this grant and certain indentune of 17J2, divers mnesne conveyances, anid ultimately by an indenture dated the 26th of August, 1842, by which the manor was settled to certain uses, under wbiek Mr. Rowland F, W. P. Standish, the petitioner, held theg, first estate in pogse. sion. It appeared that a charter had been graiited by Kin John to IIGod and St. Mary of Holm e Oultram.' gbr charter was recited and confirmed in a charter froga Bgenry IIL, (122) granting all that isl&ad- of HohneC i,a,s~ its rights, bounds, and its appurtenances which our'father .hath given it to them," which p*Uo certat,ortionweredewrbedtobe "by tbe dlrclt$ the se." i quo iwarranto 20th Edward L (120 thetile Of the Abbot of Rolmn Caltra to the manor was called in question and was Satablithed eDieDt as to " wreck of the se -` the judgment beit that " the charter it was not eon7ained that 0 Sery granted to any preaeoessor of the sea, and wreck of the sea was a Royal libert and not of the appurtenants of any tenement, wherefore it was considered that the King shoald recover against him the aforesaid wreck." At the dissolntion of the monasteries tho manor reverted to the Crown. A survey of the manor was taken under the Commonwealth, Marc20, 1649, by virtue of a commission groanded upon an Act of Parliament for sale of " the manors and lands there. tofore belonging to the late Qaeen and Prince." Among the property enumerated in the sarvey as parcel of the manor were, " Wrecks of the sea, hauling, hunting, fowling, and fishing, and all other profits and perquisites wnthin the aforesaid snanor to the royalty appertaining." Snbsequently to this came the grant of Wiliam andMar, under which and diversman conveyanoes the petitioner cls.med. In support of his claim evidence was adduoed as to porambulations of the manor held every seven years, and advertised in the country papers wnth notireiven to the tenants, and the adjancts of nags and music. These perambulations followed the coast between high and low water mark, and the fisbing nets and stakes encountered by the prooemson were cuLt and torm up ina rtion of the lor r27ightLc Evidence as to other acts of ownership was also adduced. It appeared that the 8pot as to which the contest arose was In the immediate 'nelhhbor.hood of the fray described by Sir W. EScott in "Redgauntlet," between the "Tide. net Fishing Company" and the Solway fishermen. One of the witnesses wa an old man named Solomon Geddes, posibly a descendant of "Quaker Geddes, of Mount Mr. BOLT and Mr. G. LAxz Russ7LL contended that by ancient docamentary evidence and modern usaRe the right of the petitioner to the foreshoro as against the Crowrrwas* amply made out The Charter. of William and May con- tained a reservation of gold and silver mines only, and. although there mlÂ°ht bo some doubt as to the title to "wreck of the sea, 'looklng at the proceedings under the quo warranto, yet that waS by no means conclusive as aganst the title to the foreshore. With respect to the evidence afforded by the perambulations everything had been done to give them publicityand to challenge an adverso claim. Mr. W. IL JA=iB, on behalf of the Crown, contended that there was nothing in the evidence to satisfy the Court that the Crowmn had parted with its ordinary right. Grants from the Crown were always to be construed most strongly in favour of tho Crown and against the subject, the grantee. The charter of Willam and Mary coatained not a word as to wreck or foreshore, while it was important to be observed that where franohises, &c., had reverted to the Crown at the dissolution of the monasteries, they became merged in the Crown, and would not pass by regrant unle8s specially men. tioned. The evidenoe as to the bounds of the manor arlsing from reputation and the perambulatious was wholly insufficient to bind the Crown, which had no means of ascertaining what was taking place in every.remote corner of Engband inoppoeltion to Its rights. The cae wasrot concluded at the riing of the Court. Mr. Eanaon and Mr. T. D. Salmon follow r. W. I.

COURT OF COMMON PT.PAS qA'rTn,AV XT 'A I -_ GAPP V. GIAN-DOSAf (Sitings at Nisi Prius, at WetmitnsSer, before Mr. Justice CRESSWELL and a Common J.urm.l 'inIS was an action brought to racover damages for the breach of a contract made on the hiring of a horse, aud dtated in the declaration as containing a promise that the defendant would use the animal for riding only. Mr. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr. Francis were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Shee, Mr. Pearce, and Mr. Merryweather Turner appeared for the defendant. The p'aintiff is a rldlng.rastar and a livery stablekeeper, carri- on business at Paddington, and also at Brighton. The detendant is a merchant In the city, and his wife had been for some time past in the habit of riding horses belong iDg to Mr. Gapp, and also ta}ing lessons in the art at his schooL It seemed that she had a decided preference for a mare named PolyhymnI, and some time ago, having taken a house at RichmoInd, Mr. Giandonati hired her for his wife's use for a month, Mr. Gapp saying at the time of the bargain that his usual charge was 10l. IOs a-month, but that as Mrs. Giandonati wam a kind andl skilful rider he would only ask gix guineas frrtm her. The mare was sent to Richmond with a side.saddle, and some time afterwards returned with a severe cut below the hock, much de'e. riorated in value, and useless for the purposes of the ridingschool. She was afterwards sold at Aldridge's for about 10l., and this action was brought to recover the differenoe between her value before the injury, which was stated to be 50i., and what she afterwards fetched at the sale. The mode in which the damage to tho mare aroEO was this -whUle she was in the posession of the defendant his coachman, with the assistaace of the oetler of the iaSS of Richmond-hill, put her into harness in a chalse the shafts of which were too short for her, for on setting out, although perfectly quiet at first, when she was driven down the incline of Richmond-hill, the carre pressing on her bind quarters, she ran away, the wheels came in oontact with a post, the chaise upset, and was dashed to pleces, and the mare seriously injured. Mr. Serjeant SZEE, at the termination of the plaintiff's case, contended that at the time of the hirltg nothing was said about any restriction in the mode of using the mare, and put the defendant into the witness-box to prove that he had not promised to use her merely for riding. Mr. Justice CRESSNVELL, however, said that as Mrs. Giandonati had ridden the animal in question before and had never had her in harness, that as she had been sent with a side-saddle expressly for her use and had been chosen on account of that lady's preference for her, no one in their senses would suppose that she was required for driving par sea What would Mr. Giandonati have said if Mr. Gapp set her with a set of harness on her back? The question then resolved itself into one of damagos, and to contradict Mr. South, the eminent veterinay surgeon, and other witneses who had proved theserious nature of the wound which the mare had recelved, the defendant's coachman and a young man named Dodge, who had ridden with Mrs. Giandonati some days after the accident, were called. They spoke of the injury as a very slight one, and The learned JUDGR baving summed up the whole case and commented upot the want of iudgment displayed by both the coachman and MLr. Dodge in permitting Mr. Giandonati to ride the mare so soon after the accident, tberebf most probably infdicting further damage upon the The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages 351.

P.AQT-q- (1decnt-Lor ChiOf JUWtiC COCKBURN, JsUeis ERLB and WILaA?,xS andBarotu MAkRTTNW- l >A n * v Mr. Brent *ppled to the Court to know who was the proper person to tax the oOsts of the proceedinp in this court on the grt of the prosecution. A cawe was tried at .Ivol an points had been reserred for the opinion of this ourt. A pplicationwsafterwards made to the txing offlcers of the crminal court at the Liverpool Asizes, but those officers had declined to do so. It was important that there should be some direction upon the subject, as puties did not now know to whom to apply. The Lon7 CHrg Jusncz said, the Court were of opinion that they had no power to order the payment of costs. The officer of the court before 'whom a prisoner was tried Wm the propE erson to tax the cost, but the Judges thought It would he more convenient that the offlicer of this court should ascertain the oosts and give a oertficote of his opinion, tobeproduced to the offier of this court; and although that would not be obligatory upon the officer below, yet the Judges had no doubt he would adopt it; but they would make a rule, rhich they had the power to do, .hat such a course should be adopted in future. THE QUEi V. zssE The prisoner was a clerk to thetruste of a savings-hank. He was indicted for embezzling a sum of money the property of one Sidrel and others, his mastera. There was no evidenoe to ahow that SidreU wa a tragtee, and this point ,was reserved, whether the indictment oould be sustained. Mr. Macauley appeared for the prisoner. The COuiRT held thst there was no evidenoe to show that Sidrell wasa trustee and the conviction was qushed. THE QUEEN V. ESS=. The facts of this case were these :-The prisoner was clerk .to the Rugby Savings Bank, and it was the practice that when a depositor wanted his money be gave notioe to the clerk, who gave it to the manager and it was the duty of .the manger to pay the depositor, but as it was not always convenient to the deposltor to attead he frequently asked 'the clerk to receve the check for him and pay him wheen he saw him, and this had grown into a kind of practice. It pyeared that r Blay was a depositor; the prlsoner e she had given notice for the withdrawal of her moneyhebhad not done so, however. The prisoner then obtainea a check from the manager, which he apphed to his ownuse. Mrs. Bldy was ignorant of the whole proceedlng. The prisoner was indicted for laceny i stealing the checi, but the point ws reserved, whether this was a larceny or whether the check had not been obtained by false preAeneas. Wr. M.AcAILEY contended that this was a false pretenoc, and not a lareony. Mrs. Blady hWd not given the prisoner authority to do anything. Another point was that the printed rules of the bank produced at the triSi were not the orignal ruler, nor were thesignedb7 twro trustees so as to render them admissible wnthin the Act of Parliament. The names of two trustees vwere printed at the bottom of the rules. Mr. Justice ERLE said the rules were produced as coming 'from the trustes. Mr. MAcAuLzy said the Act required that the original rules should be produced. An immense deal of discussion took place between the members of the Court upon these points, and one question was whether, after the check had been givenbto the prisoner, the money waS the property of the bankeor of the deposltor. uming that in ti case all ht d been right, touldt be an answer to the depositor to say tht the money had been paidfor her to her agent? Thae Court took time for consideration. THlE QEE 'V. DEING AND w1.

THE ISTRMUS OP SUBZ. ALEXANDRIA, Nov. 6. The European and Australian Mail Company's steamer Australasia reached Alexandria on the 2;th ult.; but, owing to the delay in the arrival of the Eimen from MIelbourne, the salla detachment of troops temained on board the boat. until yesterday afternoon, when they were landed and sent forward by rail. This is the first batch of mea that has gone through in uniform. Mr. Wetton preceded them on the way, and every arrangement was maade to insure their safe arrival at Suez with comfort and despatch. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Pottinger arrived from Bombay on tho 2d inst. Consider. able anxiety was produced by a report to the effect that on her way up the Red Sea a large screw steamer had been seen on shore. As the Emeu wa, stAted to have left Aden before the Pottinger, there was every reason to fear that a serious accident had befallen the Australian steamer. The anxiety that was felt on her account was, however, happily relieved by the tidings of her arrival at Suez on the evening of the 3d inst., with 55 passengers, and speie to the value of 524,706LDmring the night of the 2d of October she had struck on a coral reef, close to the spot on the Nuxbian coast noted on the maps under the name of Duberdubb, about 80 mlles north of Luakin, and almost directly opposite to Djedda. In this perilous position she lay for 54 hours, but at length she was got off and was run upon the beach, which fortunately consisted of soft sand. Nine days now elapsed before she was agaia floated off This was, however, at length effected, a portion of her coal being sacrificed and the fore part of the ship lightened by every possible means. The leaks were well stuiled, and with her prumps constantly at work she reached Suez in safety after a passage of three days. The Marseilles portion of her mall has, however, not come forward. The Admiralty agent, regarding it as hopeless that the steamer could proceed on har voyage, had transferred the boxes to a native boat, in which with the purser and two of the passengers he made for Djedda. In steaming up to Suez the Emeu fell in with the Hindostan, from Calcutta, and, having communicated with her, the latter turned back in search of the mail agent. On arrival at Djedda she found that he had left for Suez on the previous day. She followed 70 miles in his course, but, fnding that it lay among shoals and reefs, she was compelled to abandon the attempt and to continue on her way to Suez, where she arrived yeaterday morning. The Emeubas suffered so =-rerely that it is very doubtful whether she can return to Australia without being docked and undergoing thorough repairs, for which purpose it will probably be found that she must be sent to Bombay. Tha passengers speak very highly of the cool judgment and skill displayed by Captain Small in the critical position in which the ship lay, as well as in extricating her and bringing her to her deatination. The troops per Australasla will proceed to India by the Hindostan, which sails to-morrow evening. The Pottinger was to leave for Bombay this afternoon. The stemer Dauchman, with the second batch of Royal Engineers for India, arrived here on the 31st ult., and the men went forward on the following day, temporary accommodation baving been prepared for them at Suez on board tho Peninsular and Oriental Company's storeship Zenobia. Telegraphic communication between Alexandria and Suez has been nearly interrupted during the last few days. The serious inconvenience which this irregularity has caused during the present heavy transit can readily be conceived. It is attributed to the severe and almost con. tinuous rain which we have had during the last three days ; but the length of time that Is often consumed in the transmission of messages has on former occasions already given just reason for complaint, and, whether or not the more Immediate cause lies, as has been alleged, in the weakness of the batteries, it is hoped that a remedy will at once be sought and applied to meet the eviL The Vioeroy left Alexandria some days ago, and Is at present in the Delta. The sum collectd at Alexandria for the Indian Relief Futnd amounts Â£) about 400f., which receives the addition of nearly 2001. subsoribed by the British residents in Cairo. The corn-market has been rather more plentifully sup- plied from the interior during the past fortnight, but trau-sactions in general, and more especially those of a speculative natur, have been much restricted by the intelligence of the critical state of monetary affairs in Europe. Prices of all descriptions of produce have declined, and the closing rates for SaIde wheat are quoted at from about 30s. 6d. to 33s. per quarte-r free on board. Beans are somewhat firmer, at from 28s. to 2Â°s. 6d. There have been some ariivals of the now crop of cotton, but the demand for this staple has also greatly sabsided, and prices are looking down. The freight-market is quiet. In exchange comparatively little is doing, but the tendency is to lower rates, owing to thegrowing scarcity of money. First-classpaper on London, at thaee months, is quoted at from 102 to 10214 Diasters per pound.

GREAT FInE IN THE CITY.-The most extensive fire that has taken place within the city of London for some time past happened on Saturday morning, at 4 o'clock, on the premises belonging to Messrs. Smith and Sons, wholesale confectioners, carrying on business in Bell-street, Cripplegate. The building in which tbe fire commenced was nearly 300 feet long, four stories high, and contained property of great value, indepandently of steam engines and apparatus for cutting, moulding, stamping, and bolmig articles of confectionery. The discovery was made by a police-officet of the city force, who at once gave an alarm, and sent off for the fire escapes and engines, In the course of a few mintutes the Royal Society's escapes attended, as well as numerous engines of the London brigade and that of the Yest of England office. Before, however, sufficient time had elapsed for an engine to be set to work, tho fire, seizing upon the great amount of sugared articles in the place, rushed through the upper windows and loopholes in the building. After several hours hard work the firemen at length got the conflagration subdued, but not until an enormous amount of property was destroyed, including the dremsing-rooms and theircontents, thestove-roomns,the juicorooms, and the jujube warehouses. The rest of the premises and contents are also seriously damaged by fire and water. The firm was insured in the Lancaster, the Northern, the Mnchester, and Globe fire-offlices. Five of the Salters' almshouses and some of the houses in Mnkwell.street are also much damaged. The origin of the fire is unknown RSOBBERY ANfD AnESIE'PTED M nER ON WESTMIONSTER-: UDnG.-Yesterday (Sunday) morning no little sensation was created in the neighbourhood of Lambeth aud Westminster in consequence of a report that a foreign gentleman had been waylaid on Westminster-bridge, twice stabbed in the lower part of his stomach, and afterwards robbed of between 187. and 191., and that he was lying in the Westminster Hospital without hopes of recovery. lUpon the renorter making in''el it Was ascertained that between t'he hours of 4 and 5ro'clook yesterday morning.

A new Cabinet had at length beea formed, the President having yielded to publie opinion. The new Cabinet consisted of Don Jeronimo Urmeneta, Minister of the Interior; Don Salvador Sanfnentes, Justice; Don Francisco de Boria Solar, Finance; General Don Manuel Garcia, War. This combination was considered a moderately liberal one, and had given general satisfaction to the public. The political excitement that formerly existed had all sab. sided, and everything promised to go along quietly. An amnesty decree was issued on the 18th, the anniversary of Chilian independence. Dates fromBoliviaaretothe2Sth. The revolutionarymovements in this Republic had assumed a more general charac. ter, and Dr. Linarea had assumed the title of Provisional President, and taken the field against the Constitutional President, General Cordova. The cities of La Paz, Oruro, Cocabamba, and Chuquisaca had pronounced against the Government. General Cordova was marching against the first named city with 1,500 veterans. La Paz had a garron of only 1,500 recruits. Linares was in Cocabamba, and he had issued a decree declaring all Bolivians traitors who did not join him. Cordova had issued a counter decree, condemning all persons to death who joined Linares, so that between them both the poor citizens were in rather a difficult position. In La Paz the residence of the American Minister bad been broken into, and the deposed authorities, who had sought refuge under the United States' flag of AIr. Dana, were taken therefrom. In Cobija the Prefect nominaied by Linares bad not been received. Cordova, it was said, was badly off for troops, having no cavalry or artiUery, and it was probable that he would be obliged to yield to a movement which appeared to be general, and leave the republic.

THE SUSPENSION OP THE BANK A CE -0 (Fzom the Economist of Saturday.) No one who examines the Bank returns made up to Wednesday night, and who hu any knowledge of what was taking place on Thursday morning, can have any doubt that the letter from the FirstLord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Bank of England, suspending the operation of the Act of 1844, was issued just in time to save a great national calamity, and the irretrievable destruction of many privato fortunes. Let us in the first place exsmine what changes had taken place in the condition of the Bank during the week which ended on Wednesday night, and in the next place let us compare the relative position of the Bank now and that in which it stood in 1847, when circumstances were adjudged by the Government of the day to be sufficiently grave, even without any precedent, to suspend the Act, and which oourse may be considered subsequently to have received the tacit ratification of Parliament. In the first place, then, the following figures, which ar,e taken from the returns made up to Wednesday night, the 4th inst., and those published to-day, made up to the evening Vf the 1Uth, speak for themselves in terms the import of which cannot be misunderstcod:- Nov. 4,1857.

Bat the most remarkable feature is the enormous increase of private securities, which amounts to no lees than 3,485,2021., showing that that sum, in addition to all the receipts from bills and loans falling due, had been advanced to the public within the week. Making a fair calculation, it seems certain that the advances from the Bank to the public in loans and discounts during the week must have exceeded 5,000,000& From these figuves it is apparent that on Wednesday night the entire reserve of the Bank of England, including the 12 branches in London and in different parts of the country, amounted to 957,710Z. of notes and 504,4431. of coin,while the deposits amounted to no less than 18,250,000& This was the position in which the Bank began business on Thursday morning. The step vwhichhad been wisely taken by the Bank had been effectual for some days in stopping the foreign drain. But interna discredit and the consequent hoarding of money on the one hand, and the vwith. drawal of gold from the Bank of England for Scotland and Ireland, as also of notes for the purpose of strengtboning the reserves of country bankers in England, on the other hand, continued without abatement. In the early part of the morning stock was sold to the extent of nearly 500,0001. on account of Scotch, Irish, and country bankers, with a view of obtainig gold and notes, and the demand upon the Bank for discount by persons of undoubted credit and upon undoubted scourities was even greater than it had been the day before. It is said, and we have reasontobelieve with truth, that a single firm applied for and obtained early in the day discounts to the amount of 750,0004.; and we believe it is a matter of fact that in no instance did the Bank refuse to discount any bil which it would have taken in the easiest times. But as a consequence of these united transactions upon the unprecedented small reserve with which the business of the day was commenced, It must be certain that the notes and coin were reduced early in the day to a point at which it could neither be safe nor prudent to allow the huge transctions of the Bank to rest. We have no means of knowing tbe lowest point to which the reserve was reduced, but it It more than probable that it did not exceed one-half even of the small amount at which it stood in the morning. Under such cireamstances it would have been the gravest error on the part o. the Government to have hesitated for another hour to suspend the Act, and thus to save the Bank and the country from the inextricable confusion to which allwould have been exposed, if, as appeared almost certain, a forced in place of a voluntary suspension had occurred. Throughout this trying crisis the Directors of the Bank of England have conducted their affairs with the greatest dis. cretion, courage, and consideration for the public. Acting firmly upon the soundest principles, they did not shrink from raising the rate of interest to a point sufriciently high to check, and finally entirely to counteract the foreign drain. By this polioy the country has been protected against the severe struggle which was going on between different countries for the precious motals And It wvas by this wise and far-sighted policy only that the dlrectors were enabled to continue to aid with so liberal a hand the requirements at home. It is said, and we have reason to believe with truth, that in four days of the present week, from Monday morning to Thursday night, the advances made by the Bank to the public exceeded 5,000,0001., which would have been quite umpossible if, by keeping the rate of interest lower, the foreign drain had continued. We may rest assured that it was only the advanoe to 10 per cent. that enabled the Bank directors to aflord such ready and complete aid to meet the internal discredit and panic which have existed for tmany da a past, and which still are not entirely subdued. snt let us now compare the statein whieh the Bank stood on Wednesday night with that in which it stood in October, 1847, when by common consent it was deemed necessary to suspend the Act. And It is well here to observe that so entirely was the necessity of that step acqulsced in that no one that we are aware of, from Sir Robert Peel himself through the entire rank of the sternest supporters of the Act, ever ventured publicly to eballenge the course taken by Lord John Russell and Sir Charles Wood at that perilous moment. The comparison of the two periods is as follows:- BAxS1R Rnrvn;s Fon 1817 AD 1857. Oct. 23, 1817, Noy. 11, 1857.

These additional advanoes were rendered posdble in a great degree by the enormous amount of private deposits placed in the Bank, which on Wednesday lest amounted to 12,93.5,0001 agsinst 8,580,0004 in 1847, being an increase of liabilitiesaunder this head of no less than 4,355,0004 But against this increase of liabilities bow did the reserve of the Bank stand ? The bullion on Wednesday night was less by 1,142,0001, ; the reserve of notes was only 957,0001 against 1,547,000M In 1847; and the entire reserve of notes and coin together was less by 532.0004 Whatever reasons, therefore, there were in 1847 for the policy then adopted, the reasons for taking a similar course on Thorsday were much stronger,-and it will be impossible for any one who acquiesced in that course at the former period consistently to object to it now. hut, indeed, the crisis had become so serious, and a dead lock was so imminent, thatno portion of r,he press has denied that something had become necessary to restore confidence; hut only two alternatives have been suggested as being preferable to the suspension of the Act. An able contemporary says :-" If the discount houses and Any of the joint-stock banks apprehended a withdrawal of their deposits to an extent to cause public inconvenience, it was their business to make common cause to guarantee each other's safety, and, if any nominal or contingent suspension were necessary, to bear the discredit of it themselves, and not to inflict it on the Bank of England and the country. They could have announced to the public that, a run being threatened, they had combined to mitigate Its consequence; that, not being able to foresee its possible extent, they had agreed to sUspend for the moment any return of deposits, and that to meet the difficulty they would issue their promissory notes at three months bearing nine per cent. interest, and secured by their common liability, A meeting of all the prindpal bankersand merchants,includingtheGovemorsaud Directors of the Bank of England, might have expressed approval of the wisdom of their course, and before a few weeks had passed these notes would have been at a premium." And again :-" There was, however, an alternative which, although equaUy unjust in being an act of Government relief for which there was no true claim,.would still have prevented a sacrifice of principle. An issue of 11.-notes could have been adopted without anv infringement of the doctrines on which the Bank Charter Act is grounded. The fact that the permission for the circulation of such notes terminated in 1829 is not material, as the law could have been set aside on one pointlas easily as on another. This plan, however, seems not even to have been considered." The first of these alternatives is simply a proposal for certain banks, though nerfectly solvent, to suspend payment, and to offer depositors their promissory notes at three months for their money. This would have been to imitate in the worst form the course of some of the Amuerican banks, which has been so justly and so ably commented upon by our contemporary. Again, it does not follow, though banks might so far have disregarded their obligations to pay ' at call" a to make such a proposal, that depositors would have been found willing to have accepted bills at three months, which they did not require, in place of cash, of which they stood in need. But, be that as it may, we aro confident that few will be found who would not prefer an inroad upon a mere arbitrary limit to the issues of the Bank of England, maintaining specie payments as rigidly as ever, to a auspen. sion of payment on the part of banks having ability enough to pay their debts. With regard to other remedy suggested, the issue of 1I. and 21. notes, which we have reason to believe was well considered, we are entirely agreed that it would, if it had boen practicable, have been a more perfect remedy than a further license to issue notes of IH. and upwards, inasmuch as notes of a lower denomination would have answered all the purposes of gold coins both in England and Scotland, amid thus have led to the return of large quantities of bullion to the Bank of England much sooner than it wFill otherwise take place. In the first place, however, that course would have equally been a suspenson of the Act of 1844 ; for that Act prescribes a limit to the paper circulation of the Bank, and xt would have wtade UÂ°o diff093n4 Xii what denotin"tio~ of note an exces of that limit took plcoe. But, in the next' place, the isusof 1L and21 notes was simplyan lmpolbty; No pes were ready, and no preparation had been de and before the mere physical diiculties could have been removed the remedy rmight have been too late. In principle, however, an isue of such notes would have bee exactly ther same as the meamure which has been adopted. Uoon the sspension of the Act in 87 there were no, dout many grounds for criticism of the conduct of the Bank directors which cannot be alleged upon thi occason.. It was justly said then that the directors, disegarding thesn of the times, had not nfailedtoincreRsethe-rate o. interest soon enough or sulffic ently, but that at oneze, in the face of a severe drain, they actnaUy -educed the' terms for advances. In 1847, when the bullion was reuoted in April to 96867,WM, the ate of discout wason then raised to ter cent., at which it stood till the 7th oC August, wheni It. Ia lraisd to 5A per cent., at which it: stood until the bullion was redocedp to 89,430,000L in tin week when the Act was suspended; and then for fonr weeks it was raised to 8 per cent. Contrast with this coue. of prooooding the conduct of the directors in the presesn. year. With the exceptlon of afew weeks the rate of Atl. count has raDged from 6 to 10 per oent., without anr suggestion from the Government. On the 10th of October, wth the bullion at 10,110,0004, the rate or discount was 6 per oent. :-when it fell to 9,524,0001. the rate was raised to 7 per cent., sub aquently to. 8 per cent., then to 9 per cent., and, finalyi, to 1.0 per cent. Indeed, we are not aware of any point upom w;hich, even In locking back upon the past, and with the knaowledge which e:xperience has given, an unfavorahle criticosm could be passed upon the policy of the Banc directors. They have combined In an admirable manner' firmnees and sound principle with the utmost liberalty andS courage. Finally, we must protest against this sep on the part of. the Government, justified as it is by the circumstanoes ot the moment, being regarded in the slightest degree as a, concession to the views either of those who believe in the efficacy of pa per circulation to supply indefinitely tbs- ico of capital, or of those who think it the duty of the- vernment to secure to the country what is called " ches money." Those who contend for an indefinite issue oe paper money and those who believe in the possibility ot Its extension at the will or by the uncontrolled power oC the tsuers, even while the principle of convertibility iL maintained, we woudd esrnestly entreat to examine theaccounts which we publish this day. By those acoountrthey will find that the notes in circulation oa the 4th Inst. were 21,080,000L, and that, notwithstanding between thas . day and the 11th the Bank had Increased Its advanoes by noleS than 3,485,2021., the notes in the hands of thes public after all the extraordiniry transactions oE! the week were still only 21,036,000l., and we willventure to predict that the ste now taken, by whicIr the issue o notes is uncontrolled, except by the obli. gation of convertibility will not add in any sensible degree to the amount In circulation before the Govern. ment letter was Isued. As to the advocates of wrhat is called "cheap money,Jit is enough to remind themx that the conoession is accompied by a condition that the rate of discount shall be continued at 10 per cent. - that is, the rate which has been found sufficient t4> subdue the foreign drain, and thus indirectly render money more abundant for home purposes. In short, the whole effect of the suspension of the Act is to remove an arbitrarr limit placed upon the Bank by the Act of 1844, withont i the slightest degree releasing it from the obligation of casL. sayments, whether for its notes or its deposits, but placing it in pint of fact in the same podtion as it stood under the' Act of 1819, and in which the Bank of France stands, with. so much sense of the obligation of maintaining a sufficientamount of specie in order to secure cash payments under' any posdble ciroumstances, that it is always prepared tomake great sacrifices in order to preserve a suficient amountof bullion. The same obligations will now rest upon the Bank of England, even under the suspension of the Act of 1844.
THE1 ScoTcE BA1uSm-The events which have occurred in Scotland during the last week andtheinfluence which they have produced upon the banking establishments of that country deserve special notice. It has for some, weeks been known that the Western Bank of Scotland-an, establishment with a paid-upcapitalof 1,OO,5000.,havingno,les than 98 branches, a circulation of notes to the amount of 454,9534 by the last returns, holdingdeposdts to an extent be. - heved to exoeed 6,000,000L, and having a proprietary the known private property of a few of whom exceeds the whole obligations of t e bank-was in serious difficulties in oonsequence of the lock-up of a large amount of Its available, means with the houses which have recently failed. After an, unsuccessful appeal to the Bxnk of England for assistance, the directors of which thought the more legitimate source for applcation was the other Scotch banks, the Western Bank succeeded in obtaining advances made finally without y condition to the extent of SOO,OOOI, but further nce beigreuired, and it appearing doubtful wbero the linit wo be found, the other banks finaUy on Saturday last declined to afford further assistance, and in consequence tha WVestern Bank suspended on Monday. The stoppage of a bank of the mawitude and known wealth, whieh we have described raturally produced a severe ruam upon all the other banks, under which the City of Glasgow Bankl with 83 branches and a circulation oE 352,1284, succnbed - the pald-up capital of the latter bhnk we believe to bo 1,000,0001., and the deposits arem sid to be about 3,000,0001. It is needless to add thatthe proprietary of both these banks Is such that no doubt whatever is entertained of the payment in full of aBl their obligations within a very reasonable time. Inden these circumstances it is extremely to be regretted that the other banks, after the very liberal assistance they had afforded to the Western Bank, had not at once consentedto receive their notee, and have thus prevented the rapid. spread of the panic which ended in a common run upon all: the banks and in an abstraction of bullion from the Bank of England to meet it to an amount of at least L,500,OO0 We understand that, finally, all the remaining bAnks have consented to take the notes of the two suspended banks at theirfull value, and the panio in consequence has considerably subsided. In the meantime, however, two very important. Oircumstances have occurred, both demanding the most serious attention of the Government. In the first place, it. is understood that the six great banks have submitted a. statement of the peculiar position in which Scotch. banking has been placed by these events, And suggesting as a remedy the suspension of the Bank Act. of 1844, and the making of Bank of England notes a legal tender in Scotland, sith a view, no doubt,. to their use as a reserve against the exoess of their isses under the Act of 1845. Ithe next place, these events have led at once to a great vacauum in the paper circulation of Scotland. For an accident of this kind the Act of 1845has made no provision. According to the Act of 1844, in the) event of any hapsed issue of notes, by failure or otherwise, the Bank of England is authorized to make good the deficiency by an additionalissue upon Government securities. So. again, in the lrish Act, the Bank of Ireland is empowered to make good any lapsed issues in Ireland; but with regard to Scotland thereis no such provision at all i it is evidently a ca-eus omissu, The amount of the circulation of the Westemn Bank, by the last returns, was 454,98x, and of the City of Glasgow Bank 352,128U, together 807,1UI., which, under the existing provisions of the law, could only be replaced by the other banks by a permanent addition to their stock oÂ£ gold and silver to that amount and by its abstraction from. the already reduced reserve of the Bank of England_ There are only two modes by which it appears to us that these circumstances con be wet in accordance with sound principle. To make Bank of England notes a legal tender in Scotland would require an Act of Parliament, anditis obvious that if they were made a legal tender, so long as their denomination is confined to notes of 5 and upwards, they would not be applicable to A Scotch circulation. There can,. however, be no objection in principle, and it would certainly be much more convenient in practice that Bank of England. notes should be substituted for gold and silver as representing the exceso over the authorized issue of the Scotch banks, so, long as it is clearly understood that such substitution would. in no way release the banks from the legal obligations under which they always rest of paying their liabilities in gold If demanded. With regard to the lapsed circulation of the, two banks referred to, the mode by which it should be tilled up, following the anslogy of the provision in the English and Irish acts, is obvious. B those Acts the banks of ogland and IrelAnd respectively are authorized to make good the deficiency by issues Upon Government securities. In Scotland there is no national bank, but there, could be no difficltty in apportioning the lapsed circulation, if it were deemed rlght., to the authorized banks of issue, in proportion to their existing issues, upon the deposit of Government securities for the amount, in thesame way as the Ban,k of England and the Bank of Ireland appropriate Government securities for their additional issues under similar circumstances; and, we may add, in the same way as the banks in Scotland deposit Government. seecurites as a guarantee for the reoeipt and transmiseion. of the public revenue. By some such arrangements as these there can be little doubt that the seriousderangement which has taken place in Scotland would rapidly subside, and that the bullion which has been taken from the Bank of England would rapidly return. Whatever may be said abont the imprudence of the two banks which have suspended, it must be plain that their disasters can In no way be attributed to the circulation of notes. The. aggregate circulation of both amounted to 807,1111., against. which they held coin to the amount of 443,2321., conaiderablv more than one-half of the whole noe circulation,. while the deposits bearing interest in the two banks are. understood to exceed the sum of 9,000,0001-Economijt. TiE Ar'TEStA,- WELL AT GRE2NELLE, PAPIS.- In the esr 1833 M.
