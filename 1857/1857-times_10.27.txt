JIELPS'S SPANISH CONQUESr JN AMEBICA.* Neither Robertson, nor Irving, nor Prescott has rendered, nor is it likely that any other writer on the same subject will ever render, this work of Mr. Helps superfluous or secondary. There is always an audience open for any competent person who forms his views for hinself and frorn data of his own sifting; and this applies to investigations of all kinds, historical as well as others. Whatever has been accomplished by the predecessors of Mr. Helps-and Mr. Prescott, for example, has left us a work which it would be difficult to surpass-Mr. Helps's history has, in addition, a special object and an independent importance which it is unnecessary to insist upon. Based as it is on his smaller and earlier book, The Conquerors of the New World and their Bondsmen, its purport is to develope the conception of that work by treating the Spanish conquest in -America principally in relation to the history of slavery and the government of colonies. As a leading branch of this inquiry attention has been concentrated on the " enacomiexdos¢," or arrangements for expropriating the labour of the Indians by their Spanish conquerors, and which was almost an invariable incident of the settlement of Spanish Arerica. This incident has hitherto been ordinarily neglected by the historians of New Spain, though it was the greatest direct result of the political transactions they narrated; while it is the topic on which Helps has dwelt preferentially. "To bring before the reader, not conquest only. but the results of conquestthe mode of colonial government which ultimately prevailed-the extirpation of native races-the introduction of other races-the growth of slaveryand the settlement of the en?miendas. on which all Indian society depended," has been avowedly the primary object of Mr. Helps's researches. nasmuch, however, as, independently of this particular object, his work is a history of the various conquests and discoveries made in America by the Spaniards, it is a lar.e and comprehensive labour, as well as a speciaY inquiry. How much of a scholar's life it has consumed up to the point it has reached already it is not in our power to state; but it is evident to any one who will glance at its contents, and observe the manner in which they are backed up by copious references to recondite materials, that sufficient has been done to redeem any life from the reproach of sterility. Mr. Helps has evidently dwelt on his subject; long and lovingly, has collected materials for its elucidation from all available sources, has studied and collated them with as much ardour as a serious sense of his responsibility would permit, and is now finally discharging his task with exemplary caution and deliberation. Where others would, perhaps, have felt themselves compelled by circumstances to hurrv on with their work, Mr. Helps has felt himself at liberty to linger, to meditate, and even to moralize while considering the various aspects in which the subject can present itself to a mind disengaged and free from distracting influences. He has thus had the means of exhibiting a chastened judgment and a large and humane candour in his historical conclusions; and, in short, he must have so gratified his estimable inclinations that we should say his work was less the labour thanthe luxury of a lettered retirement. There are, however, certain drawbacks to a work produced in the spirit anld under the circunmstances which we assume to have operated in this case. The spectator of the march of events, or he who wishes to march writh them and to come in a reasonable time to the end of his journey, is apt to be uingrateful and impatient at the moral speculations with which Mr. Helps detains him on his way, and which come with oracular ease from the cushions of a library chair. He, the spectator, is in boots and beaver, while Mr. Helps is in dressing-gown and slippers, and he is withheld from his purpose to be off and away by the gentle prolixity of his meditative host. The detention by the Ancient Mariner is thus paralleled in a mitigated form in the case of the reader, who lingers too scrupulously over the abrasions of his paper knife. At all events, we are permaded that the digestion of history, if it is to be to any considerable extent nutritive and beneficial, will not admit of our protracting the ruminant process to such immoderate excess. Eistory in a very large degree is the record of human energy and passion, and there muast be a keen sympathy with that energy and passion on the part of the guide or conductor who offers to go with us and point out its course. If the exhibitor is slow blooded as well as thoughtful-if his earnest soul is linked with too subdued a temperament, he may fail to appreciate the depth and momentum of the current, or at least he may fail to impress these conditiona upon his auditors, even if he is adequately impressed by them himself. There are, moreover, certain peculiarities in the history of New Spain which especially require that its recorder, to use the vulgar expression, should " look alive." One of these which Mr. Helps observes upon is less a reason why he should " tell his story in his own way" than in a way more naturally befitting its exigencies. " It does not," he says, "suffer itself to be told in any one conquest or in any one discovery. It sometimes lies wholly in the New World, sometimes wholly at the Court of Spain. It depends at one time on som e powerful Minister, at another upon some resolute conqueror. It follows the course of the remarkable men of the day, and now rises up in one colony, now in another, its direction not being governed by the relative importance of the colonies." Thus ranging irregularly about the globe, with its materials accumulating nowhere, now there, but with one common quality belonging to all of them, it simply required, as we believe, that the artificer himself should put force into his work to weld them aU together into a connected composition. He may not discover a complete solvent on either side of the Atlantic-he may not be able to place his centre of interest wholly in the old or wholly In the new Spain, but can there be a doubt of the principle on which their histories can be fused ? Mr. HZelps has dwelt primaarily on the desultory efforts for the assimilation of the two hemispheres, as if these barely fell short of attaining their object, when, according to our judement, the leading conception to be kept in view is the all but impossibility of averting the wreck of which these efforts were the merest palliatives. The sudden juxtaposition of a new world beside the old, with lts strange contrasts and confusion of ideas, its real wonders and its wonderful dreams, the misintelligence, the cross purposes, and the catastrophes which this necessitated,-this great and broad peculiarity of the situation, we maintain, is clue enough for any man who ventures into thelabyrinth. He has the means in his power to direct his course clearly, to note the bearings of every detour without losing the bond of connexion, and amid all its apparent complications to keep before his own eyes and ours the essential unity of this startling chapter In the history of our species. Now, as respects a large portion of his work, Mr. Helps has failed to do this, and according to our judgment this is the great defect in his otherwise admirable performance. If we admit that Mr. Helps has a medium of combination which might have sufficed, then, as a true historian, he should not lose sight of this main thread of his subjeot, however much he may wander or apparently lose himself in its by-paths. If he is peering into the bowels of the earth or looking up to EIeaven, he should still comprise it in his view in the most dexterous way he canT contrive. Now, our impression is that Mr. Helps, when he steps as3ide to take counsel with Providence on the errors of his fellow-creatures, forgets everything but the high moralities which are the objects of his digression. To use a legal phrase, he " travels out of the record" too freely, he soars too sublimely, he abandons himself too unreservedly to the duty or pleasure of contemplating our moral imperfections. In the meantime the cable is not properly paid out and the interest snaps; then we are put about again to catch and splice the severed extremities, and our voyage is not a fulfilment of the conditions of our charterparty. Taken separately, as we shall presently see, Mr. Helps's descriptions, and even his moral reflections, are of rare excellence. There are passages in these volumes of a noble eloquence worthy the author and the subject, but, with all his learning. penetration, and taste, the story hangs on his hands, and does not make easy or definite progress. It is impossible that any one so gifted as Mr. Helps should not deal brilliantly with some of its many conspicuous bearings. After all that others have written, we can still turn with delight to those picturesque contsts of a story which has no parallel in the world's annals.

Lodo, Z. :ker, 1857.! gorgeous, mnd, in the case of the latter its terrible, accessories again open upon us the sudden effulgence wit which they startled and dazzled the C,astilian horsemen. Their cities are like the cities of a dream, glittering as the towers of Fairyland, as Bernal Diaz said, "like the enchanted castles which they tell of in the Book of Amadis," and conveying by their disappearance the same impression of insubstantiality, rlling away from our eyeslike the drop scene of a theatre, or melting in the fiery haze of remote havoc and destruction. There is no similar spectacle in the whole range of history respecting wluch our information is equally minute and authentic, and Mr. Helps directs otur attention to it with renewed emphasiE, and with a solemn meditative eloquence which is peculiar to himself. These nations are to him " a relic, a warning, and a sign-like Dome burnt-out star drifting along, hideous and purposeless, amid the full and shining orbs which still remain to adorn and vivify the universe." The suddenness and completeness of their destruction is like the withering up of a gourd, and Mr. Helps on the one hand is at pains to exhibit their flourishing aspect, and on the other to show that, as a matter of fact, for which we complain that he has not dwelt more on the dpriorz reasons, their overthrow by their Spanish conquerors differed from ordinary conquests by the fatality of itz blow, that it struck at once to the very heart of their national and social life, or smote as it were their spinal cord, " leaving them in a deathlike paralysis." Thus we have seen various descriptions of ancient Mexico, but this of Mr. Helps is supported,_by , variety of further references which we do not think it necessary to append. ,,Who shall describe Mexico-the Mexico of that age? It ought to be one who had seen all the wonders of the world-i and he should have for an audierce those wrho had dwels In Venice end Constantinople, who had looked down upon Granada from the AfIhanbra, and who had studied all that remains to be seen of the hundred-gated Thebes, of Babylon, and of Nineveb. "0The especial attributes of the most beautiful cities In the world were here conjoined; and that which was the sole boast of many a world-renowned name formed but one of the charms of this enchantress among cities. Well might the rude Spanish soldier find no paraUlel but in the imaginations of his favourite romance. Like Granada, encircled, but not frowned upon, by mountains; fondled and adorned by water, like Venice; as grand in its buildings as Babylon of old; and rich with gardons, like Damascus,-the great city of Mexico was at that time the fairest in the world, and bas never since been equalled, Like some rare woman of choicest parentage, the descendant of two Royal honses far apart, who joins the soft, subtle, graceful beauty of the South to the fair, blue-eyed, blushing beauty of the North, and sits enthroned in the hearts of all beholders,-sD sat Mexico upon the waters, with a diadem of gleaming towers, a fair expanse of flowery meadows on her breast, a circle of mountains as her zone; and, not unwomanlike, rejoicing in the reflection of her beautiful self from the innumerable mirrors which were framed by her streets, her courts, her palaces, and her temples. " Neither was hers a beauty, like that of many cities, which gratifies the eye at a distance; but which diminishes at each advancing step of the beholder until it absolutely degenerates Into squalidity. She was beautiful when seen from afar; she still maintained her beauty when narrowly examined by the impartial and scrupulous traveller. She was the city not only of a great King, but of an industrious and thriving people. " If we descend into details we shall see that the above description is not fanciful nor exaggerated. Mexico was sitnated in a great salt lake, communicating with a fresh. water lake. It was approached by three principal causeways of great breadth, constructed of solid masonry, which, to use the picturesque language of the Spaniards, were two lances in breadth, The length of one of these causeways was two leagues, and that of another a league and a-half; and these two ample causeways united irn the middle of the city, where stood the great temple. At the ends of these causeways were wooden drawbridges, so that communication could be cut off between the causeways and the town, which would thus became a citadeL There was also an aqueduct which communicated with the main land, consisting of two separate lines of work in masonry, in order that if one should need repair the supply of wter for the city might not be interrupted. " The streets wvere the mogt various in construction that have ever been seen in any city in the world. Some were of dry land, others wholly of water - and others, again, had pathways of&pavement, while in the centre there was room for boats. he foot passengers could talk with those in the boats. It may be noticed that a city so constructed requires a circumspect and polite population. "Palaces are commonplace things to describe; but the abodes of the Mexican Kings wsere not like the petty palaces of Northern Princes. One of the most observant of those SpTaniards who first saw these wonders speaks of a palace o. MWontezuma's in which there was a room where 3.000 persons could be well accommodated, and on the terracehke roof of which a splendid tournament might have been given. " There was a market-place twice as large as that of the city of Salam anca, surrounded with porticoes, in which there wasroom for 50,000 peojple to buy and selL. "The great temple of the eity maintained its due proportion of magnificence. In the plan of the city of Mexico, which is to be found in a very early edition of the LeUcr-s of Cortes, published at Nuremberg, and which is supposed to be the one that Cortes sent to Charles V., I observe that the space allotted to the temple is 20 times as great as that allotted to the market-place. Indeed, tho sacred enclosure was In Itself a town, and Cortes, who seldom stops in his terrible narrtve to indulge in praise or in needless description, says that no human tongue could explain the graudeur and the peculiarities of this temple. Cortes uses the wvord "templo,"~ bnt it might rather be called a sacered city, as it contained many temples, and the abodes of all the priests and virgins who ministered at them, also a university, and an arsenaL. It wvas enclosed by lofty stone walls, and was entered by four portals, surmounted by fortresses. No less than 20 truncated pyramids, probably cased with porphyry, rose up from within that enclosure. High over them all towered the great temple dedicated to the god of war. This, like the rest, was a truncated pyramid, with ledges round it, and with two small towers upon the highest surface, in which were placed the imapes o the great god of war (Huit'zilopochtli) and of the principal deity of all (Toecatlipuk), the Miexcican Jupiter. It is sad to own that an entrance into these fair-seeming buildings would havve gone far to dissipate the admiration which a traveller-if we may imagine one preceding Cortes-would up to this moment have felt for Mexico. The temples and palaces the polished glistening towers, the aviaries, the terraces, tie gardens on the house-tops (many-coloured, for they were not like those at Damascus, where only the rose and the jasmine are to be seen); In a word, the bright, lively, and lovely city woid have bcenforgotten in the vast disgust that would have filled the mind of thebeholder when he saw the foul blood-besmeared idols, with the palpitating hearts of tht day's victim8 lying before them, and the blackclothed, filthy, unkempt priests ministering to these hideous compositions of paste and human blood. 'Let the stern Cortes enter,' is the cry which the amazed spectator would have uttered when he saw these horrors, and thought of the armed men who were coming to destroy them. And yet this conjunction, wthich was to be met with at Mexico, of beauty and horror, is no new thing, and something very like it may be discovered in other guise throughout the world!i Clvilization rside by side wiith the uttermost horrors ! Such is the contrast to be found in the present age, too; and such, perhaps, in each of ourselves. And so, with some feeing of pity even for a nat-ion of cruel and bloodthirsty idolaters, we may conternplate the arrival of the Avenger as he mnakes his entry into Mexico." In his portrait of Cortes, Mr. Helps has done justice to the lineaments of the man who was incomparably greater than Bizarre or any of his c;ntemporaries, He dropped on the city of Montezuma like a meteoric stone," but his conduct and policy were worthy of the most discerning and deliberate ]?urPose. "A a snake through tangled grass and herbage, or rather, like an agile wild beast through the forest, now lightly leaping over the brushiwood, now bounding along the open space under great trees, always with an eye to prey, always with a soft footfall, so did the politic Cortes move through the difficultiee which beset his position-the wiles of dubious followers, the snares of uncertain allies, the perils of anunkuown country, and theweightof countless numbers brought to bear upon his little band, which was but the scenic counterfeit of anarmy." His suppleness and unscrupulousness as to means were, however, coupled with a rectitude of intention as to enaswhnochwas stihL more remarkable, and which Mr. Helps succeeds In his sedulous endeavours to keep before us. Cortes was, according to his own notions, highly honourable-a genuine hidalgo and a thoroughly loyal man. It may be doubted whether in the annals of conquest any conqueror can be found (except, perhaps, some Mahoraedan one) who was more deeply imbued with the missionary spirit. Yet the manner in which he converted the bulwarks of idolatry in Cempoala to his Christiau purposes-that is to say, changing the vestments of the idolatrous priests from black to white, and giving them charge and lucrative custody of his Catholic altar-shows a knowledge of the world which historical experience, with its corroborative testimonies, could scarcely have amplified. On the other hand, his determination to destroy his fleet, and so to cut off all means of retreat from his army, has itself become one of the great texts In history. The projected seizure of Montezuma's person also belonged to him alone, and "whatever greatness there was in it, call it great prudence or great iniquity, was his only." So of his patience and temper, his businesslike capacity, his mnoderation and prudence, which are elements in his complex character, if we note all the evidence Mr. Helps affords us, our opinion of him grows with the progress of his story. It is true that if ever there was a man who had undertaken a great part without rehearsal Cortes was that personage. But it is equaly true that he belonged to the samae order as Charles V. and Augustus Cresar, that he was circumspect and self-possessed, never abased by misfortune nor over-elated by uccess; that he was eminently tenacious of his resolve, yet singalarly amenable to reason; that though cruel he was not wantonly so; that he was a firm friend and a good master; that he was ready and flexible; that he went on learning; that every blunder he committed was a fraitful lesson ; that with him there was less of what is accidental than is to be observed in the rest of mankind, and that himanity with much to regret cannot fail to be proud of him. It is one of the happiest aspects of Mr. Helps's work that he succeeds in impressing the reader thoroughly with the great qualities of Certes, while Alvarado, he says, may be comDared to Afurat; and his relation to Cortes may not inaptly be compared with that of the King of Naples to the First Napoleon. Of Pizarro, on the other hand, he maintains that he lacked statesmanlike qualities, and in dealing with his owr countrymen-not with the Indians-was probably deficient in decision. He came in contact with it less vigorous and advanced form of civilization than Cortes, and it therefore fell as easily to a ruder and inferior operator. The arrestation of the civilizing movement in Peru and the stationary condition in which Pizarro found it are indicated by Y fMr. Helps with penetration anud precimon. " All human forms and systems lose their first fluenoy or elsaticity, become crystallized, and generally last too long. Thus it may have been with the rule of the Incas, whic at first, perhaps, was a beneficent moulding of many scattered tribes into one harmonious and well-regulated empire. Certainly, it must be confessed that in Pera everything stopped short. There were magnificent roads, but traversed by no 'wheel. The wheel, though, is a great invention, and possibly there are things as simple as the wheel which lie close to us, and yet are hidden from our apprehensiou. In the Peruvian architecture, however, the same defect is visible. Imamense stones were put together with exceeding care and consummate skill; but we look in vain for a vault. ing or an aroh. In some part of the working of the precious metals, wbo have ever been more skilful than Peravian workmen ? But they did not know the use of the iron which lay about them, and one hatchet would have been worth an infinity ofgolden toyu Each man may have improved a little uspon the work ol0 bis father, but it would have been im nent in him to invent any new process. Were there netthe God-descended Incas at Cnsco, whose business it was to tell mankind, at the proper time, of any new thing that might be needed? The same stopping-short is to be seen in the religion of Peru. The wonderful mysticism and depths of devotion which exist in the Bralmrnical creed, the vast aspirations of loving piety which are to be found in the Persian poets, were seemingly unknown to the more literal Peruvian. Any kind of free-thinking seemn to have been a privilege reserved for the Incas themselves. One of them is said to have ingeniously suggested that a creator must be present at creation, whereas the Sun, he said, is often absent. Another Inca remarked, that this perpetual traveling of the Sun was a sign of servitude, and he threw doubts upon the divine nature of such an unquiet thing as that great luminary appeared to him to be. " As regards astronomy, the Peruvian looked up at the heavens as much as the Mexican, probably more so; but the discoveries in astronomical science known at Cusco were quite trivial when compared with those which had been made in the valey of Anahuac. " Again, nothing can well be ruder than the Peruvian mode of keeping record. It is true that the Amnauta made an astonishing use of his knots and coloured silks in the cuippus; but, surely, it is a matter of wonder that an in. te.llgent people, having so much to record and to communicate, should have been con,tented with sticks and strings as their means of recording. That the Government of the Peruvians was full of good devices,-that it was nearly the best thing that an unlimited despotism could come to,-may be admitted,; but it must be recollected that the great mass of Peruvians lived under an Inspector and Accuser (such were, in part, the offices of the Decrtrion) who hadl only nine other persons to survey. "Still, the Peruvian empire was an extraordinary, and, m some measure, a felicitous production. Any thoughtful man would have hesitated to overturn such a dynasty as that of the Incas, which, strange enough, was to lose its vast possessions, abdicate its great claims, and, finaUy, be absorbed by marriage into the family of Borgia, thus to become mere European nobles, looking up for ancestors to the Sun and to Alexander the Sixth." In pursuance of that thread which runs through his work, but of which he sometimes loses sight, Mr. Helps notes the gradual growth of slavery and its influence in the extinction of the native populations. The discovery of America was, in fact, the occasion of the slave trade, for it created a market which otherwise was wanting. Though antecedent to this date black slaves may have been and were a favourite part of the grandeur of a great household, they could scarcely have found their way in any numbers into a country already stocked with hardy labourers, fitted for the soil, as was the case with Europe. Ca de Morto states that in 1455 the export of slaves from Africa was only 700 or 800 yearly, and Mr. Helps thinks this number greatly exaggerated, and that from 1455 to 1492 the trade in slaves must have fallen off, so seldom are they mentioned or referred to in the docnnents of that date. Columbus, however, proposed as a matter of course to take slaves among the cannibals, but his proposal was at first put aside by Ferdinand and Isabella, and only tolerated ultimately in the case of slaves taken in war, by the latter who especiaUy showed a tenderness and religious care for her new subjects. In the course of his letters Columbus, though from no sordid bent, speaks " after the fashion of a practised slavedealer," recognizes the exchange of slaves for goods from Spai as a natural practice, and makes that further proposal, that the colonists should be allowed to make use of the services of the Indians, and which led to the repartimiesttos and enc miendas which were the subject of so many provisions and contra. versies, including the noble endeavours of Las Cmas and his coadjutors, and the humane attempts at mitigation made from time to time by the Court of Spain. The first notice we have of negroes going to the Indies is in 1501, and it is important to observe that in some numbers they were employed in the Indies much earlier than has been supposed. Las Casas himself recommended their importation with the object of lightening the presure on the indigenest but, writ'in his history in his old age, he thus franrly ovwned his error:- " This advice that lioense should be given to bring negra slaves to these lands, the Clerigo Casas first gave, not con siderin the injustice with which the Portuguese take then and make them slaves; which advice, after he had apprehended the nature of the thing, he would not have given for all he had in the world . . Por the same rason holds good of them as of the Indians" Mr. Helps directs our attention to his expression " not considering" as a proof of the honest candour of the Clerigo. Thus, he does not say " not being aware of," but though it was a matter known to him, he admits that his moral sense was not sufficiently watchful respecting it. The extinction of the original inhabitants of the West India islands, howesver, went on at such a pace that the importation of neg,roes, niaiigE the Clerigo, soon grew into a xsystem. The Requisition to tae Indians, drawn up by the learned Dr. Palacios Rubios, and which was filled with stupendous assumptions, and with terms such as " church," " privileges," " vausalage," " exemptions," &c., which, when translated to them probably on the first occasion on which they listened to European voices must have occasioned them no little perplexity, is a documenit which MrA. Helps has cited at length, and on the comicality of which he dwells with some unction. Oviedo proposed to remedy the indifference of the Indians to its theological arguments by keeping some of them " in a cage," in order that they might learn it at leisure, and that the Lord Bishop might explain it to them. But the Lord Bishop would not have had such an easy task, if we may judge from the reply which was made to it by the Cacique of Cenu, and which was too good not to be extracted here. "Enciso's account of the effect of readingthis requisition (which he givos in a simple, innocent way), is very interesting. Making his appealto two of the caciques of Cen(i, he tels them the wholesto-y of the world, as witten in the Requisition-how there was one God, three and one, who governed the heavens and the earth, arnd how Ile had come into the world and had left in his place St. Peter, and how St. Peter had left, as successor, the Pope, as Lord of the universe; and how, as such Lord, the Pope had given this land of the Indies and Cenfi to the King of Castille. AU this being premised, it was easy to show that obedience was to be instantly rendered to hin, the Bachiller Enciso, as one of the captains of the King of CastiWe. But the Caciques took an objection, to use a lawyer's phrase, to Enciso's history. ' They replied to him,' he tells us, ' that, with respect to what I said about there being but one God, and that He governed the heaven And the earth, and was Lord of all things, that it seemed good to them, and so it must be - but that in what Idaid about the Pope being the Lord of all the universe in the place of God, and that he had given the land of the Indies to the King of CastiUe, the Pope muse have been drunk when he did it, for he gave what was not his ; also, that the King who asked for or received this gift must be some madrnan (eah7un loco), for that he asked to have that given him which belonged to others; and they added that, should he come there to take it, they would put his head on a stake. They were lords of this oouatry, bed there was no need of any other."' Eventually these poor Indians, who were better logicians than soldiers, were too glad to bave recourse to suicide to escape from their conquerors and taskmasters. Such, however, was the loss of life among those of them employed in the mines that the Father Motolinia calls the mortality among them the " ninth plague." The number of deaths was so great that the corpses bred pestilence; and, men- tioning one particular mine, M otolinia affirms that for half a league round it, and for a great part of the road to it, you could scarcely make a step except upon dead bodies or the bones of mem. Tho birds of prey coming to feed upon these corpses darkened the sin. At tbe time of Pizarro's expedition to Peru it is said, there was scarcely an Indiant left alive in hispaniola. When thinking of the different life they led before and after the conquest, it seems, says Mr. Helps, " as if the fate of the whole race might becompared to that of some beautiful and graceful maidens who, on some fatal festal day, had playfully ranged themselves in exquisite order, to support on their heads, as living Caryatides, a slight; weight of fruits and flowers, which had aU of X sudden hardened into marble and crushed them under it." Their fate is thus denoted by a graceful image, while its process is described at length by Mr. Helps with a conscientious desire to be just and accurate, which is itself the most valuable quality in an historian.
RBCRUITING. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMlES. Sir,-I readwith great pleasure the manly, straight. forward speech of the Commander-in-Chief on the occasion of inaugurating the monument to be rai3ed at Sheffield to the soldiers of the British army who fell in the Crimea. His Royal Highnes, while comforting us with the sssurance that recruiting is gonmg on satisfactorily, indicates, however, his apprehen. sion that the ordinary inducements to enlistment are not quite sufficient to meet the exigencies of the present crisis by his earnest appeal to the citizene and gentry of Sheffield and of England to use theLl influence with those around them in aid of the re. cruiting-sergeant; and the reduction of the standard and relaxation in the strictness of the preliminary medical examinations prove that there is a pres. sure upon the system of feeding the military forces of the country which necessitates the authorities to receive into the ranks men whom they would otherwise-that is, under different circumstances, reject. My observations on the physique of the population of these isles U me to believe that unless when very young-and therefore unfit for the severer duties of campaigning-Englishmen, Scotchinen, and Irishmaen of 6ft. 4in. even of the regulation measurement of 34in. round the chest-short as those inches are now marked on the recruiting tape-are generally weakly and slender, and, although many of them, being the natives of towns, have the intelligence which is requisite for good light troops, they do not possess stamina to enable them at once to encounter the hardships of war, such as enable the sturdy little French and Piedmontese, to whomn nature has given a lower standard of average height, to form excellent Voltigeurs and Bersaglieri. From my experience of the effects of re&dcing the standard at the close of the Crimean war I am persuaded that it is a step to be avoided as long as possible. As soon as our regiments returned we had to get rid of thousands of ill-grown weak lads and elderly men whom we had accepted in our hour of need as good soldiers. The testimony of many recruiting officers to whom I have spoken recently leads me to apprehend that if the bulk of our recruits-at least 50 per cent. of them-were sent into the field the nation would find them a vaniahing quantity, to be found only on the sick and pay lists, or among the hospital returns, which would, nevertheless, represent a constant outlay and expense. On these and other grounds I venture to suggeat that we should endeavour to utilize some of the thousands of trained soldiers who are fit for service, and who have bought out their discharge from disgust, pique, a moment of irritation, or some more permanent dislike, or who were discharged at the close of the last war after several years' experience of military duties. These men might be enrolled in R brigade. or be distributed among regiments on service, and I think that the assistance of some 3,000 or 4,000 skilled and seasoned soldiers might be very speedily secured, instead of our having recourse to raw, if not unsound, material. What I propose, with some diffidence, is to this effect:- That the War-office should offer to receive back all men of good character who have bought out or relinquished their claims on the service during the last five, four, three, or two years, according to circumstances, restoring to each man the SUU he had paid, and allowing his former service to run on and count for pension in case he desires to remain in the army; that each man should receive the bounty and kits now given to recruits; that their enlistment should be for a limited term-say, three or five years, and that at the end of it sorme inducement; might be held out to them, such as facilities for emigration, or military colonization, or a bonus of a few months' pay. I have every belief that a corps of 3,000 or 4,000 men could be rapidly raised in this way, and that excellent officers could be picked for it out of the half-pay list, and non-comrmissioned officers out of those who bought or otherwise obtained their discharge. It is not the least discouraging feature of our military system that many of the best soldiers leave the service as soon as they can, and one of the general causes assigned by themselves for their dissatisfaction is the tyranny of the superior noncommissioned officers, particularly of the sergeantmajor, who is only too often in possession of the only lens through which officers inspect the interior eoonomy of their regiments. A short time ago I was staying at a provincial hoteL A gigantic waiter, straight as an arrow, and possessed of such evident strength that it seemed a pity it should be wasted at such a moment on a soda-water cork, appeared at dinnertime, and went through the ceremonv of laying knife and fork with a precision which would have delighted Lord Granvlle, of lifting off the cover of the soup tureen with a click like cocking a gn, of dressing up the slice of cod amid its flankers of parsley with mathematical smartness, and then of drilling those invariable and obdurate cutlets, which, with a withered partridge or a morose ill-conditioned pheasant, constitute the beau idead of " a respectable county hotel" dinner, writh such an iron rigour that I could not help saying to him, "Why are not you a soldier ? I think you would like it better than being a waiter." The man smiled. "aIndeed, then, Sir, I would not. I have tried both. I have beea a sergeant in the Guards; went through the whole campaign, and rd much sooner be here than back with my battalion." The next time he came intothe room he brought me in his medal with four clasps-Alnma, Balaklava, Inkermann, Sebastopol. He told me he landed with his battalion in Bulgaria, and never was sick or absent a day from it till he embarked with it on the evacuation of the Crimea, although he was wounded on several oecasions. " And why did you leave ?" said I. " Well, Sir, the fact is that after all the hard work was done a fresh sergeant-major came out from London who had never seen a shot fired, and very soon after he came out he had 11 full sergeants broke, and I wa, one of them. I knew I had done my duty, and did not deserve it, and so I laid up every farthing I could scrape together, and the moment I got home I bought out my discharge, having just saved the 201. I was offered the stripes again, but I would not take them." Well, I did not think much of this circumstanee, for I know that soldiers are sometimes disposed to be grumblers, but when I heard the man -was clever, honest, and hard-working from other sources, and that he had received a good education, I could not but regret the view he had taken of the service, whichl had induced him to prefer the comparatively menial office of a waiter to chance of promotion and active employment in the occupation which youth andstrength ought to find most favoured. I met in the same town one of the police officea who had all the Crimean honours on his breast, but he told me he too and many a comrade, several non-commissioned officers, had gladly laid out their extra sixpence a-day during the war on buying their discharge when they came home; " and, bad at police work is," said he, "we bave more fairplay, and better chance of getting on here, than In the army." And so, Sir. it appears to me that it is not enough for uis to procure a supply of soldiers, but that we ought to Use means to retain in the service those whoare most suited to it, but are not always disposel to remain in it.

Sf ONEY-MARKETand CITY X.N TELLIGENCB. Monday Evening. The entire suspension of specie payments by the Few York and Boston banks reported this morning Ly the American mail is the most satisfactory announcement that could have been looked for. Had the step been taken a fortnight earlier an immiensa amount of ruin might have been averted. The banks, after having bytheir mismanagement brought about the state of affairs which rendered the panic posssible, sought to save themselves by the sacrifice Df the whole mercantile community, but the public St last have taken the matter in their own hands, and forced them to a stoppage, which will place them in the same condition with their victims and thus terminate the struggle. Their course had been nimply this :-By a system of most imprudent adVances they had encouraged the public to rely on abundant accommodation, not only on bills of exchange, but on the bonds and promissory notes ot railway and other corporations. When the over Issues of this latter class of securities began to excite alarm, and it was seen by a knot of speculators that If they could be brought into sudden discredit general confasion would ensue, the banks turned round upon those they had deluded, and not merely refused further accommodation, but caUed in, as far as possible, all that had been granted. Of course, universal fright followed, but as firm after firm went down the banks still boasted that they were determined to muaintain themselves, and actually excited some sort of admiration at the grandeur of their resolve. But it was plain they could not succeed, and that even supposing their preservation possible it might be paid for too dearly. In the opinion of calm lookers on another week was alone required to stop every house throughout the State. Apprehensive, however, of the penalty of losing their charters, and animated by individual rivalry, they continued blindly stubborn. The community at last, it appears, with an instinct of despair, resolved to bring them to an end. A concerted run was arranged by the depositors, and on the evening before the departure of the packet a general stoppage was ascertained to be inevitable. Eighteen of these establishments had already been brought down, and the 33 that remained saw that another day would seal their fate. A deputation of the pre sidents of three of the largest was therefore despatched to the Governor of the State at Albany to pray for the necessary legislative steps to legalize the suspension, and meanwhile a notification of the event was given in all the New York papers of the morning of the 14th inst. Its effect was instantaneous. Every one, it is said, seemed to feel that the ordinary channels of business would forthwith be restored, and that from that moment the progress of recovery wouild commence. The steamer iled at noon, and the last accounts therefore reach only to II o'clock a.m., but a postscript of that date announces that everything was going on quietly and that aU excitement had passed away. This result was perfectly natural. The inconvertible paper of the banks would now circulate at a value in proportion to the discretion with which it might be issued, and supposing it to be kept within close limits, there Is no reason that it should fall much, if at all, below par. Nlo doubt was entertained that the Legislatue of New York woulld sanction the movement, and, the period of resumption is contemplated to be the 5th of April. In the interval about 3,000,0001. or 4,000,0001. of gold may be expected from California, and speculative shipments of specie from this side must result only in loss. The great danger which has pressed upon our money-market during the past two or three weeks is therefore lightened. It Is also believed that many failures that must have occurred here if the present event had not taken place will be averted, and that news may arrive by future packets of the resumption of businems by several of those among the New York firms whose fall was occasioned solely by the inability to sell produce, or even to negotiate undoubted bills. The funds opened this morning at a decline of an eighth, the American intelligence being at first regarded as unfavourable; but subsequently there was a steady imlprovement, and late in the afternoon the statement of the capture of Delhi imparted great firmness. Consols for money were first quoted 88i to a, whence they receded to 88. From this there was a gradual rise to 881, and finally there were buyers at 89'. For the 10th of November the last transactions were at 89k. Numerous purchases were made by the public, and the rate for loans on Government securities did not exceeed 5 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 207, to 20'); Reduced, 87; to 88; New Three per Cents, 88 to i; India Stock, 208 to 210; Iudia Bonds, 35s. to 25s. discount; and Exchequer Bills, 1 5s. to 10s. discount. At the Bank to-day the demand for discount was exccssiv-e, and was chiefly from the leading mercantile firms. The cause consisted in the discount houses having curtailed their operations as much as possible until the (jucstion was settled whether the Banik woiild adopt a further rise. In the afternoon money was abundantly offered on short loans. It transpired this afternoon that some difliculties in the position of the Liverpool Borough Bank had rendered an application necessary to the Bank of England for assistance. A Court of Directors was sunmioned to consider the case, and the application was favourably entertained. The Borough Bank will therefore be furnished with means to liquidate every outstanding claim, but it is understood it will be required to wind up. It was established 21 years ago with a capital of 950,0001., and its reserve fund has lately been stated at 101,2021. The number of ehareholders is between 300 and 400, and with the responsibility of these parties and the aseets in hand the cover for any advances that may be maade to it -will be ample. An impression seems to be entertained that two-thirds of its capital may yet be preserved. Business in foreign stocks bas been rather active, and prices continue fairly maintained. Turkish was marked as low as 84,i, but afterwards recovered, the last quotation at 4 o'clock showing an advance of nearly 1 per cent. over the corresponding price of Saturday. Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99; Mexican, for the aecount, 19i ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 756, i, and 77; ditto, Three per Cents., for the ac. count, 52; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97; Spanish New Deferred, 251 and A; ditto, Certificates, 54; Turkish Six per Cents., 88; for the account, 87i, i, and i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 97j; Dutch Two-andaHalf per Cents., (;3k; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 9,~. - In the corn-market this mnorning there was a fall of 2s., and to effect heavy sales a more considerable reduction must have been submnitted to. The finaa quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 06f. 75c. for money and 66f. 65c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of a quarter per cent. About 20,0001. in gold bars was withdrawn from the Bank to-day for exportation. About 50,000 half imperials (42,0001.) are expected immediately from Runsia, The exchange at St. Petersburg is still as low as 36d., and therefore much larger sums wouild be sent but for the obstacles interposed by Government. The unfavourable state of the exchange is attributed to various causes, among which are the large purchases of Russian stock made in Germany and elsewhere since the interest on deposits at St. Petersburg has been reduced from 4 to 3 per cent., the payments for the steamers bought for the Government and private companies, large imports to replenish the stocks exhausted during the war, and, lastly, the sums spent abroad by Russian travellers, in- cluding the Imperial family. The financial improvement at Hamburg continues, and the rate of discoumt has receded to 8 per cent. In the long list of failures reported from New York to-day the principal are, H. A. Colt and Co., agentsto Drake and Co., one of the oldest Havaunah firms; F. and A. H. Dodge, of Georgetown, millers; David S. Brown and Co., of Philadelphia, importers Of dry goods; Corning an lCo., brokers and bankers, of New York; L. 0. Wilson and Co., an old ZTew York firm, which went safely through all the disasters of 1837; Hall, Dana, and Co., and Fraucih Skinner and Co., of Boston and New York, importers of dry goods. The effect of the bank suspensions on the stock-market had not been ascertained before the departure of the steamer. The closing transactions on the preceding day comprised-EritRailwav, 8 ; Reading, 31; Panama, 65 ; Michigan Central, 35; New York Central, 55; and Illinois Central, 70L. Erie, Michigan Central, and Illinois Central had all suspended Payment on their floating debt, the latter with ample authority to draw upon England, of which it was unable to avail itself. The next steamer from New York would be the Fulton on the 17th. She may be expected onl Friday. The suspension was announced this afternoon of the firm of W. and H. Brand and Co., a house formerly in the WVest India trade, but during the last three or four years engaged in large American transactions. The stoppage is attributed to the non-receipt of remittances from the United States. The amount of liabilities has not been stated, but it is supposed to be rather considerable. Annexed is the circular issued:- " 109, Fenchurch.street, Oct. 26. "Gentlemen,--We regret to inform you thab in consequence of the failure of remittances by this day's American nail we are under the painful necessity of suspending oar payments. - The disastrous condition of commercial affairs in the United States is the alone cause of the inability of our correspondent in New York to send forvward the requisite fund,, and it is impossible for us at present to estimata its 'ull effect upon his position. We are not, however, with. out hope that the step we are corpelled to take may yet be only temuporary. Il the interim wve have instructed Mr. George H. Jay, accountant, of No. 10, Old Jewry-chambers, to prepare a statement of our affairs, which shall be submitted to you at a very early period. We are, Gentlemen, your obedient servants, " W. A.ND H. BsAND AND Co. The Paris letters mention that the idea of a suspension of specie payments by the Bank of France finds numerous influential advocates, who are determined to urge it strongly, in preference to an unlimited rise in the rate of discount, should affairs get worse. The question is alleged even to have been discussed at a eitting of the Banlk. Except as a remedy for internal and uncontrollable panic, when it is demanded as a temporary protection for the majority against the minority, the step would be one of such ilagrant dishonesty that it may be hoped it wiDl be summarily discarded. The Government, it is said, are determined not to sanction it. At present, so far from there being any serious pressure, the best paper can be negotiated at a half per cent. below the Bank rate of 71 per cent. The movement on the subject therefore may obviously be attributed to the hopes of ignorant speculators on the Bourse. There has been increased activity In the general business of the port of London during the past week, the arrivals of corn, flour, rice, fruit, and sugar having been very large. The total number of vessels reported inward was 313, being 90 more than in the previous week; and the number cleared outward was 125, including 28 in balast, showing an increase of one. The number of ships on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 62, being two less than at the last account. The following is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders:- " The committee have received advices from Mr. 'Whitehead of the 19th ult., from which it appears to be very doubtUul whetlher matters will have been sufficiently advanced by the time that the next packet leaves to expect any remittance sent by her for the dividend-fund. On the 16th ult. General Comaonfort became, by an overwhelming majority of votes, the constitutional President of the Itepublio; on the same day the Conagress was to have been opened, but there was not a sufficient attendanoe of deputies to form a quorum; and public rumour ascribes an inten. tion to the President of offering them the alternatives of investing him temporarily with extraordinary powers, or of accepting his resignation. His Excellency had on the 31st of August conceded to Mr. Antonio Escandon the privilege of constructing a railway, involving the issue of 5 per cent. bonds for 8,000,000, which it was intended to negotiate in Earope. His Excellency had also on the 7th ult. conceded the Tehuantepec Railroad privilege for 60 years to the Louisiana Company of Tehuantepee. The country appears on the whole to be quiet." The Alhambra, Peniusular and Oriental steamer, appointed to sail to-morrow, will take out 25,0001., principally gold, for Cadiz.

The railway-market has been afifcted by the deI pression in the funds, and a general deeline has taken placrv, Great Northern, especially, being quoted at a r eduction of 11. Canadian descriptions also receded; Grand Trink were marked as low as 37i, but showed more firmness towards the close. Punjab were dealt in at 5s. premiuml. IFrench shares were flat on the receipt of lower pricesfrom Paris, but a recovery subsequenily took place, and the final quotations show httle alteration. Dutch Rhenish, LonmbardoV7enetian, and Royal Swedish were slightly lower. Tbe adverse nature of the news from America has exercised considerable effect upon American securities, and a heavy fall took place in Illinois Central and New York Central, the shares of the former having been done at 10 discount. In mines the transactions were unimportant. Joint-stock banks were in demand, but no alteration occurred of consequence. In miscellaneous securities there was a slight improvement in Crystal Palace, and Mexican and South American Land were rather weaker.

THE CORN TRADE. MAXK.LAj NE. AloiDAY ArosRNooN. OcT. 25. Arrivals last week were generally plentiful. The exports were 1,33a quarters wheat, 130 quarters oats, 50 quarters beans. The receipts in English wheat were 8,343 quarters, inr foreign 17,758 quarters. The supply from the near countioi this morning was good; but a report having got abroad that shipments of flour would be permitted in France on the pre - vious dulness, trade was almost paralyzed, and the few sales made were fully 33. per quarter below the rates of last Monday. The bids made for foreign samples were in a like ratio; bat holders, though willing to make some concession, were not disposed to accept them. Of country flour there were 18,443 sacks, of foreign only 100barrels 500 sacks. Norfolks were again reduoed 2s. per sack, and American were rather In buyers' favour, but s small stock preserved the value. Town millers made no *lteration in their prices. The quantity of English barley was 3,919 quarterg of foreign there were 13,636 quarters. Malting samples were about ls. per quarter cheaper, and inferior qualities were Is. to 2a. per quarter lower. The trade in malt was heavy, and prices Is. per quartr less for all kinds. Of oats there was another liberal foreign supply, again chiefly Russian, and amounting to 53,308 quarters, with 2,650quartersfromLimeric'lG1 quartersfromAbordeen, and 338 quarters of home growth; in all, 57,046 quarters. Prices therefore gave way on ali descriptions to the ex-tent of Gd. to Is. per quarter. The supply of beans was 593 quarters English and 825 quarters foreign. Of peas there were 554 quarters English and 500 quarters foreign. No change took place in prices, but business was quiet. Of linseed there were 3,615 quarters, with oxports 2,400 quarters. The monetary pressure produced a decline of Is. to 2s. por quarter in seed, but cakes, being in good demand were not altered In value. In the seed trade soareely anything was passing, foreigu offers of cloverseed being neglected. Canary about kept its price, as well as mistard-seed, hempseed, and other descrip. tions, being quoted as last Monday. Arrivals of Oorn in the Port of ,ndeon from Oct ig t.

THE POLICY OP THE BANX. i (From the cwnomistL) The advance in the Bank rate of discount to 8 per cent. must not be regarded us an indication of any farther pressure upon the money.u,arket for domestic purposes, but as a protection agaast a drain of our bullion 'which. might be in,duced by the low rate of the exchanges with the Untted States. livery one, even those wbo are not conneoted with that trade, can easily understand that the rate at which the hillis remitted from America can be turned into cash r4ust be an important element in the caldulation, whether it will be profitable or not to transmit gold equal to the net amount which such bills afford to the holders' when reduced by the discount to be paid. If a house receives bills to the vslue of 100,0001., the exact quantity of gold vihich can be obtained for them must depend upon the rate which is paid for converting them into cash. At 3 per cent, paid for their discount, tne quantity of gold which would be obtained for them would represent, supposing them to be two months' bills, 99,5001-but at 8 per cent, the amount of gold whioh would be obtained would represent only 98,6671. It must, then, be quite plain that, taking the exchange between the United States and this country at any given rate, the ma-n question whioh must determine the profit or loss of transmitting gold must be the rate at which gold can be obtained here in exchange for the bWils that are to be drawn or received against it. A rate of 7 per cent. diEcount may make the operation profitable; a rate of S per cent. may entirely suspend it. Looked at in this light the policy of the Bank of England during the last three years, of goveraiDg the rabt of interest by the foreign exchanges, and the pressure which exchange transactions, rather than domijestic transactions, has brought upon It, is at once a sound, and, so far as the home trade is concerned, a truly conservative policv. It is of infinitely less importance to the home trade that a high rate of interest should be paid for a time than that our resources should be drained so much to feed speculation in foreign countries that the ordinary wants of our merchants and manufacturers must be curtailed to an inconvenient and ruinous extent. The loss occasioned by the depreciation of property under such circusnstances would be much greater than from any difference in the rate of discount, even when at the highest. We have seen the time when bankers have nominally fixed the rate of discount at 5 per cent., but when their sources of supply were nearly dried up by foreign drains. At the present moment it would be but little satisfaction to the home trade to see the rate of discount kept dowa at 5 or G per cent,, when the effect would be to drain our market of bullion in order to feed a demand abroad, to be SDon followed by a state of much more severe restriction at home. A high rate of interest, like a high price of cominodities, is the only true correction of scarcity. As in the case of commodities, it acts as a security for the future in three ways :-first, as we have shown, it prevents the exportation of bullion; next, it encourages its importation; ana, lastly, it tends to economize the use of capital bymodifying tranctions already undertaken, and for the time inducing too great caution in entering Into new ones. In every way an adequately high rate of interegt is the best-nay, the only real conservator of the home trade at a time like the present, when, in almost every great oommercial country, enterprise and speculation have outrun the legitimate means of conducting them. It is some satisfaction, too, that in the present juncture of affairs in the United States a recent change of a sound and rational character has been made in the French law as it relates to the Bank of France, the effect of which will be to aid, and not to neutralize, as 4t has done upon former occabions, the efforts of the Bank of England. Before the renewal of the charter of the Bank of France in the present tear, that establishment was prohibited by law from charging more than 6 per cent, discount. What was the effect of that restriction? Was it any advante to the trade of France ? Money being obtained upon ower terms in Paris than elsewhere a constant drain was kept up on the Bank of France, and gold, supplied by forced operations from the Bank of England, ran through the Bank of France in a continuous stream; and thus Indirectly in part neutralized, at the cost of the Bank of France, the natural effect of the restrictive measures of the Bank of En land. Now, fortunately, that restriction is removed, anl the Bank of France is left at full liberty to follow the market rate of discount. The effect is that already, short as the present pressure has been, the rate of discount in Paris has been raised to 73 percent. This wholesome change is to this country at the present moment extremnely important. Suppose the French law to have rematued unaltered, and t7he maximum rate of discount to havestoodat 6 per cent., it is certain that in placeof 20,0001. of gold having been shipped to the United States in the last week a very large sum must have gone, and have so reduced the bullion in the Bank of France that a resort must have been had again, and to a much greater extent, to those forced operations by which gold could be obtained from London, even though at a large sacrifice ; and thus the efforts of the Bank- of J3:ngland, in order to protect the bullion reserve against the present artificial demand in the United States, would have been to some extent frustrated. As it is, the two great bauks, which in point of fact less or more regulate the monetary transactions of Europe, will now act in harmony, both foUowing the natural law of sxpply and demand in fixing from time to time the terms upon which they will do business. If any proof were required of the soundness of these views, we have only to point to the very inconsiderable amounts of bullIon which, both from France and England, have thus far been shipped to the United States, notwithstanding the very low rate of the exchanges. But so far as regards the future, and the extent to which It may be needful to pursue these measures of restrictive self-defence, much, if not everything, dependsnow upon the turn affairs may take in the UInited States. That is the point upon which all eyes are turned. Much has been said upon the subject of overtrading, and all kinds of general reasoning have been adduced to account for It. On one hand it is contended that too free a commercial system hasinduced to import beyond the meas of payment-on another side it is said that unrestricted bank credits have done all the mischief We place very little faith inthe latter reasonnone whratever in the former. We have seen in this country, andin many others, periods of great speclation under all systems of commercial law and under every system of monetary law. We have had monetary panics and commerdal crises under the strictest protective system, and under a system of comparative free trade-under the Bank Restriction Act of 1796, under the Cash Resumption Act of 1S19, and severely even under the Bank Act of 1844. Never was a whole nation seized with a greater mania for rash and improvident speculation than that which prevailed in this country from 1845 to 1847. But this, at least, can be said in favour of perfect freedom from restrictions-when a nation does make a great mistake, it is more easily and more quickly remedied than when men's acts are trammelled by vexatious interferences with the natural lavws of commerce. In the case of the United States at this time, if by overtrading is meant an undue conversion of floating into fixed capital in the formation of rallways and other public works, and au undue extent of borrowing from foreign countries upon such securities, and most of al an extravagant speculation in shares based upon borrowed capital, such as we witnessed in England in 1846, then we have no difficulty in assenting to the charge. But if by overtrading is meant an excess of importations and exportations, an excess of production and even of consumption, we doubt if there is much if any ground for the assumption. Nor is it any proof that such has been the case that numerous failures have taken place among importers and other traders, or even that prices are for the moment unnaturally depressed. How many In thlis country In 1847, who, as far as their legitimate trade was concerned, would have been wealthy and far beyond the reach of the crisis, were yet ruined in consequence of their speculations in railvays; and how much property shared in the depresdon caused by the general pressure, which was not in excess of the legitimate requirements of the public? Looking only at the legitimate commerce of the United States, we can discover no evidences of overtrading in this sense of the term; and this, so far as regards the future prospects of the cosmnerce and manufactures of this country, is the most essential point for consideration. In 1835 and 1836, preceding the crisis of 1837, the state of the trade between the two countries in this respect was very different. At that time the value of our ex,ports doubled in little more than a year. At this time there has been no such sudden and speculative in - crease. It is now some years since our exports to the United States reached the maximum of 24,000,0001. During tho last two years they have been 17,000,0001. and 21,000,000. respectively, and so far as the present year has gone they promise to amotut to about 23,000,0001 Considerng, then, the great increase of the real productive population of the United States, the enormous increae within a few years of the production of cotton, grain, provisions, and the other products of the soil, and the demand for them at compara. tively high prices in this and other foreign countries, considering, too, that the stocks cf all their chief articles of produce are everywhere low, and the means of replenishing them, own g to the bountiful character of the harvests, unusualy get, there are no good grounds for believing in any contracaion of their consumption of foreign commodities, or in ay difficulty in their means of paying for them. Indirectly all trasactions must for a time be disorganized and affected by the monetary difficulties, but there is no reason, that we ean dIscorer, for the belief that the substan-tial basi uponwhich the legitimate trade between this country and the United Slate restU Will be more thas momentarily shaken by the present crisis, The losses of the moneydealers and share speculators in New York and Phitldelphia will have as littepermonent effect u h dition of the industrious millons who are the rlea conseweAs us n.rpan od s hs f tcjbbr Capel-court on$tpructive eergies of Manchesr and Leods. In the meantime, however we may rest assured that the true interests of the productive classes on both sldes will be best consulted by refraining from any attempt at sustaining speculations which in themselves are unsound, and by such restrictive mesures with regard to money as shall prevent legitimate trade being sacrificed in the attempt merely to postpone for a little the time when all these undertakings mnst find their natural level. The commercial publio, better informed upOn the laws which reglate monetary aalrs than formerly, now look with composure upon a rise In the rate of discount to S per cent., tn event which at one period would have created a pauno throughout the country, and if it shaU prove needfl, In order to protect our bullion reserve, which must be regarded as the true basis and secerity of onr credit system, to reaort to still greater restrlotions, they will be regarded by all Intelligent persons only in the light of a necessary but minor evil resortedtoin order to prevent a greater. TRI WEATHEit L' THE LAE DISTRICT.-WVe noticed a paragraph copied into the Mananhrcter Qardima of Monday last, to the effect that during the last few dayE the tourists had been driven from the Ises by the " severity of the weather. " The truth is that there has not been so. protracted a summer for many years, and, unless an occa. sional fall of rain can be coostnted into a severity of season, notbing can be more unfounded than this account of the weather in the Lake district. At Brown's Lake Hotel on Monday last the dahlias, verbenas, &c., in the parterres were almost as blooming as in the stmmer. Tbe weather ws like that of early September, and none d the denizenz of that district had been aware of the " severitXt ier which w said to have dispersed the tourists. SI Thursday the air has become keener, but the weatier is bright and bracing.- WstmorcZand Gazctte,

LONDOAV, TUBSDAY. OCTOBER 27,1857. Delhi has fallen. On the 20th of September the city was completely in the possession of the besieging force, which appears to have stormed and carried the fortifications on the 14th of that month with great los1 on both sides, Our own being reckoned at 40 officers and 600 men killed and wounded. Till further intelligence arrives, the imagination of each of our readers must picture to itself the ghastly sights of blood and flame and spoil which filled the streets of the devoted capiLa;l during the six days which came between the assault and the final conquest. The fmt act of the great Drama of Retribution which we are now playing Iout in the East has therefore closed, and before the second begins the spectators have time to meditate on the plot of the piece and the actors who have assisted in its development. The vapture of I)elhi is an erent which ca only be regarded with very mixed feelings. It is a triumph of the British race over British subjects. This is no acquisition, no mastery of an ancient foe, or a long apprenended danger. We do not find ourselves before the opened portals of a new empire, with a new territory for our merchants, and a new field of honour for our soldier We only recover that which was lost, and reduce that which was rebellious. What we win back is damaged, broken, marred, and diminished, not only in the estrangement, but still more in the process of recovery. Its losses are our own. These losses are material and personal, obvious to all senses, and capable of an iammense computation. We have lost a noble army-two noble armies we should rather say,-the native army of Bengal, and the many brave and noble countrymen of our own who have fallen by their treachery. We have lost edifices, arsenals, the works of ages, and, what may count up to a greater value still, many years of peace and promise. Against these palpable and appreciable things, we gain the lesson of our prowess and resolution which we have now imprinted on the Oriental mind. No doubt it has had abundant proof of this before, but, the victim of a thousand hideous delusions, it has been ever ready to set its vain omens and auguries, its names and traditions, its times and seasons, against the historical facts, the visible certainties, and, we must add too, the undeniably good intentions of our race. No grin idol, no fresh incarnation of VISI1u, inor the still more ridiculous delusion of a cruel and licentious imposture, no phantom Monarch of an aneient dynasty sitting crowned upon its tomb, has availed against the courage of men fighting against traitors for their Sovereign and their country, and to avenge their murdered countrymen, their wives, and their children. This question has not been decided by accident or in haste. In tardy British fashion, we have given four months to a work for which impatient indignation scarcely allowed as many weeks or days. We have stopped to deliberate; we have made good our ground; we have given both sides fukl time to gather all their forces; we have aeen army after army added to the strength of the foe; we have allowed them to gather hopes from our delay, and even to conceive the strange mistake that our wrath had lost its first red heat. We have suffered the loss of name after name, once associated with the prospect of the closing scene. New actors hav e stepped on the bloody stage. If the army which has done the work at last be an accumulation, it is in another respect the remains of a much longer list. The survivors have fought to avenge their comrades slain before their eyes, as well as the victims of distant treachery. when the long siege has run through all its possible phases, and the rebel King has actually had a reign, we nevertheless accomplish our task. Conspiracy and surprise have done their best and been beaten. In the sacred city of dynasty after dynasty, and in a solemn concourse of many tribes and many religions, Queen VIcTo iA reigns alone of earthly potentates, and, whatever her title, is the true Empress of Ind. The success will, of course, be alloyed in many minds with the supicion that it might have been attained earlier, and at much less cost. Why could not the precise number that has forced its way into Delhi, and either destroyed or driven away the craven defenders, do this much earlier, when the relative proportions of besiegers and besieged were much the same ? On this point long experience has taught us all to be content with success, without quarrelling with its narrow terms or sad abatements. This is the lesson of life; to do the work before us aa well as we can, and when it is done to be content with the gain rather than to count the cost. To feel sure of this has healed many a broken heart. Defeat keeps ever alive the long story of mishaps, writing them over again in the soul, in deeper lines and darker colours. Triumph wipes them all away, or makes them lines of glory. But it may be not only a consolation, but the fact, that all we have suffered was reaUy necessary to the result. Continual accessions of numbers have not brought so much strength to the garrison of Delhi aa fresh elements of disunion, insubordination, mutual jealousy and mistrust, alike of one another ancd of the common cause. Within those abominable walls, as in the open field, and as in a hundred strongholds of villany and lust, the opportunities and trials of half a year have not been able to bring to the surface a single soldier who could command the respect and affection or direct the energies of that armed multitude. Having murdered or cast off its gallant British offioers, it became a mob, and a mob it has ever continued to this day. It felt that it had lost its intellect as well a its honour. Conscience made it coward, cowardice induced distrust, and even if there had been a man eapable of taking the command of the ariny they would probably never have had confidence in one whom they knew to be as great a traitor as theves. If this be thought inconsistent with the fact of Delhi having held out so long and made so good a fight, or with the fact of large armies Btill moving in the field, or occupying strong positions, then we have only to observe that never once, on any occasion whatever, have the mutineers stood their ground against us, even when ten times the number; and that they have never gained the maost momentary advantage, except by ambuscade, as at Arrah, or when, as at Cawnpore, famine threw a handful of soldiers and a helpless crowd of women and children into their fell clutch. Although the eyes of all the world have beenfixed upon Delhi, and it has been naturally concluded the turning point of the struggle, yet we are not to suppose the difficulties of the war over; nor is this event altogether without its drawbacks. The capture of Delhi must have the effect of liberating many of themutineers,who will present themselves elsewhere, swelling probably other bodies of insurgents. It had been debated among them whether to retreat to some strong place lower down the Jumna, so as to gain at least a few days' breathing time, or to join NENA SAEIB and the insurgents of Oude. The probability is, that the greater part will wander over the country in suficienat bodies, and at such a distance from our troops, as to live by the indiscriminate plunder of the peaceable inhabitants. Such a mode of life is failiarto the military tribes of India. They hold that it is more honourable to live by the sword than by the plough ; that it i a safe profession, and ong that will hold out when drought or the collector starves out the husbandman, and that it doe: not matter very much under what flag the trade is carried on, or whether under any flag, Till the great wars in which we fially broke up the predatory tribes, and established our strong rule over regions hitherto the nurseries of brigandage on the most gigantic scale, there were millions of men who lived by sheer piUlage, robbery, and murder. Arranging themselves into bodies of five hundred or five thousand, as the case might require, they sallied forth, looking for the richest and easiest booty, whether a town or a province. They took what they wanted and slew all that resisted, burning the cities by way of example. It can ecarcely be considered right that the effect of this war should be to throw things back into their old state-a state which many elder natives, whether Mussulmans or Hindoos, fondly look back to aa the golden age of their country. No doubt, many driven out of Delhi will return to the custom of their ancestors, which, it is stated, they carefully keep in mind by traditional stories and poems. It will be a task of no little difficulty to dispossess the soil of marauders who may gather some courage from despair, and who wiU certainly multiply their atrocities in proparHion to the shortness of their time. Nor can we regard without apprehension their desultory attempts to intercept our communications between the Lower and the Upper Provinces, and their posaible success over small detachments on the march. But this is all that we fear. By this arrival we learn the good news that General &vLocar,o having been joined by General OuTRit had crossed the Ganges, and that the relief of Lucknow may be confidently expected. We conclude therefore that the neck of the mutiny is now broken, its head crushed, and that nothing remains but feeble, dislocated, writhing fragments. in the end what escapes our arms will be absorbed into the mass of the people, and, befriended by time and retuning prosperity, may so escape the retribution due to its crimes.
Some seven years since the present Pnmsmm enunciated his celebrated doctrine concerning the rights of British subjects abroad to the protection of their own Government. No matter in what country or under what condition, an Englishman was an Englishman still, and entitled to demand the interference of England if he were wronged. His device in travelling might be " Ciris Boncus ccsum." This was the most brilliant passage of a great speeeb, and we well remember the sensation it caused throughout Europe. But, as Is often the case, the great principle has been rather asserted than enforced. No doubt, if a flagrant outrage 'Were committed on some celebrated, or notorious, or interesting personage, with any striking and dramatic circumstances which should attract universal notice, the Foreign-offlice would be on the alert, and advance to the rescue with a smartfire of despatches. But when the sufferers are unknown, the events obscure, and the whole transaction unnoticed by the public, there is too much tendency to leave things alone and to forget individual interests in attention to the lofty diplomacy of Europe. There is at present waiting redress from our Government as groas a case of hardship as -ie have ever heard of. The sufferers are Engliahmen; the perpetrator that widely known ruler, Eing PERDiNAn D of the Two Sicilies. The details were partly given in our impression of yesterday. Some months since, it wiU be remembered, an insurrectionary movement took place in the Sicilian dominions. The leader was a Co.nt PIsACA2-M, who afterwards, we believe, suffered death for the offence. The insurgents seized a Sardinian steamer, and made their way to the coast of Italy, where they landed at Sapri. This steamer, the Cagliar, was afterwards captured by two Neapolitan frigates, and the whole of its crew have been in prison ever since. In despite of the exertions of the Sardinian Minister, they cannot obtain either a release or a trial. They have, oeen confined since the beginning of July, and bere we are at the end of October. They were taken off to Salerno, handcuffed, and we are told that the marks of the irons were visible on the captain's wrists tbhree days after. Now, among these unhappy men are two English engineers. They were perfectly innocent in thought or deed. In fact, when the Cagliari was captured in the Gulf of Naples the Captain, SXTZ7, and his crew were found tied with ropes and shut up in the hold. It was evident that they had yielded only to superior force. So notorious was this thrt the owners of the vessel at once demanded its restitution, on the ground that its complicity in the insurrection was the work neither of themselves nor of their servants. Yet In spite of all this the prisoners are still kept in durance, and these two Englishmen among them. They are said to be in a state of desperation at the treatment they receive, which is such that one of the nnmber lately made two attemp's at suicide. Their effects have been kept from them, and they remain month after month in a state almost of destitution, without hope of release or trial before a legal tribunal The British Government appears to have interfered so far as to direct that every effort should be made to ameliorate their condition; but we are told that such efforts have been in vain-" neither the Consul "nor any friend has been permitted to see them, "and the money Eent for their relief was "returned." Such is the condition of two of our countrymen at this moment in the kingdom which our Government lately thought to bring to reason by withdrawing a Minister. It is evident that the King of NAPL.s cannot be turned from his course by any remonstrances or exposures. We may be sure that these two poor engineers have suffered greater indignities than their comrades, simply because they are Englishmen. That they have any chance of justice from the KneG and his police is not to be expected. Surely, then, this is a case for that interference which was so loudly proclaimed as a right when Don PACIFICO and Mr. Fn-LAY viore injured. Here are two rmen pursuing an honest occupation, and one in which Englishmen are largely engaged in the south of Europe; they are guilty of no offence; they are not conspirators nor the abettors of conspiracy. They are overpowered with the rest of the crew by an armed force, who bind them in the hold and use the vessel for their own purposes. It is captured, and the Neapolitan Government proceeds to treat all on board as if guilty of treason, They are confined for months in a prison, loaded with irons, deprived of all access to their own Consul, and prevented from receiving the visit of a friend. If such a proceeding be permitted to pass without interference, let the boast of British protection never be heard again.

TO THE EDITOB OF THE TIIES Sir,-The last letter of your correspondent "Indophllus'. oontains a misstatement so extraordinary that I can hardly think it inadvertent. He speasks of the " check placed on the consumption of opium by the monopoly," innoontly assuming the duty levied to be on the same footiDg as the ordinary Exciso duties of this coantry. Allow me in a few words to state the case more fairly. " Indophiluse wonld Ignore the faot that the growth of opium is artificially stimulated by money advances to the cultivator, and by mnuch indirect influence of a banoful sorL The opium must be sold at a fixed price to Government, who dispose of it at an enormous profit to traders, whoso boheily armed vessels convey it to China. " Indophilus" hints that this (Government) trade is regarded by many as a national in. The " dn" consits in imposing by armed foroe a fatally in. sidious, destructive vice on an unwilling Government and nation. But it is absurd to try to dissociate the moral from the political, financlal, and comrmercial side of the question, Every sin is also a blunder, an4 thls one recoils upon us by virtually closing the best markets of China to English manufactures, by raising the price of tea, and by esusing a heavy acd increasing drain of bullion to the East I will not trespass on your space by any proof of these statements. They are generally admitted facts, and they nearly ooncern the honour and the advaniage of the merchants and people of England. The time is ripe for the solution of this great question, and.

T:EE IND1AN JUTINIBS. The following is from an officer serving before Delhi:- " CAmp beore Delh, Aug. X "hIY dear father,-Sinoe lat I wrote to you I have had suoh hard work and such exposre as I never bad betoro iX my long life, but, thank Heaven, here I am safe and sound and back again in camp. Rodson was sent out withhis new regiment, and a squadron of the Guides, 104 strong, wider me to watch a lvrge party of the enemy who had gone into the Roltak district. Our force was in al about 350 cavalry-all, exoopt the Guides, belonging to Hodson's own corps, The officers were Hodson, commanding, Wgrd, Wise, IcDowell, Hugh, and myself. The first day'we marched to a place called Khurkonda, but such a marah I We had to go through water for miles up to the horses' girihs. We took Khurkonda by surprise, and Hodson immediately plaoed men over the gates, And we went in. Shot one scoundrel instanter, cut down another, and took a lies. uldar (native officer) and some Sowarn (troopers) prisoners, and came to a house oocupied by some more, who would not let us in at all; at La6t, we rushed in and found the rmcals hd takeD to the upper story, a*nd stil kept ut at bay. There was only one door and a kirkee (window); X shoved in my head through the door, with a pistol inamy hand, and got a olip over my turban for my Pains; my pistol, nsSeed fire at the mas breast (you must send me a revolver), so I got out of that as fast as I could, and then tried the kirkee with the other barrel, and very nearly got another cut. We tried every means to get in, but could not, so we fired the house, and out they ruhed a muck among us. The first fellowwent at Hugh (the writer's brother) who wounded him, but somehow or other he sUpped and fell on his back. Isaw him fall, and, thinking he -was hurt, rushed to the resoue. A Guide got a chop at the fellow, and I gave him such a swinging back-hander that he fell dead. I then went at another follow rushing by my left, and sent my sword through him, like butter, and bagged him. I then looked round and saw a sword come crash on the shoulders of a poor little bDy ; oh, such a cut, and up went tho sword again, and the next moment the boy would have been in eternity, but I ran forvrard and covered him with my sword and saved him. During this it was over with seveon men. Ward hcd shot one with his revolver and the other four were cut dowrn at once. Hugh I found was all right only a aight cut juA above the wrist. Having polished off these fellows, we held an Im. promptu court-martisl on those we had taken, and shot them aU-murderers every one, who were justly rewarded for their deeds. Next day we continued our march and got to Rohtuk on the 17th of August, where some Sowars and the poople of the town turned out *a&4st us, but fled like sheep before the Guides led by Hugh and myself, but we managed to cut up 13 of them. Next morning we were surprised to find a party of Sowars galloping down upon us-so plucky, but we sent them galloping back--so funky ! We then formed up, and the enemy came within 300 yards of us, but a few minis rifle balls sent them off. They then tried to come upon our flank, but we would not admit of that at any price. At last, as the ground was unfavourable for cavalry, we retired and brought them out In the open, when we charged and they bolted. I got a cropper over a hedge and ditch in which my horse had fallen, but picked myself up and continued the Pursuit, and soon caught up a couple of Sowars; one feUow fired at me, but missed me, and off they both bolted. I put my spurs into Cavalier'a sides and quickly overtook the rearmost man, and equally quickly Polished him off. I then went after the other and caught him up, when he had the impertinence to try and frighten me by presenting his matchlock at rne, but this was too good, seeing that he had just fired it at me I rode at him and gave him a cut on the neck, which he did not like at all, and he struck me over tho shoulders with his matchlock barrel, which I returned by a second cut, which dropped mny fine fellow from his saddle; but he was not done for yet, dn<lturnednmyhorseandrode at him;he cameatmein a furious rage and made a terrific cut at my leg, which I guarded, and as cool As a cucumbar, and in the most scientific. mauner, returned ' potnt one.' And now can you fanOY the trick he played me? He actually seized my sword in his hand and before I could get it out cat me over the head; but, as that was enscorsced In a basket helmet enveloped in a most voluminous Guide pugree (turban), the blow did not. take effecL I was not going to give him another chance, and drove my horse right at him and sent my sword into him as far as I could; the consequence was he had not room for a cut at me, but hit and wounded my gallant little horse on the cheek. One of the Guides then came up sad he was soon dLsposed of, but fighting to the last. I have the fellow's msre in my possesaion. Hugh led the other troop of the Guides, and shot two fellows with his revolver, but his mare got a baullet in her chest in the charge. After knocking about for a few more days in the neighbourhood of Xohtatk, we returned to camp yesterday. We have about 6,000 firt-rate infantry in camp, and a lot of cavalry, and when the siege train comes we may set to work and do something against Delhi, but General Wilson is very cautious, and will not hazad anything. I must now refer you to the newspapers for more general and public newe
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMBS. Sir,-On your leading article of this day's date on the casualty to shipping during the year 1856, I think the losses to shipping do not arise so much from the caues you name as from the want of good education among our seamen. I and my partner hAve had from 3,000 to 12,000 tons of shipping engaged in the trade to the Wesbern coast of Africa for the last 15 years, and any losses that we have had have happened when the ship was corm. manded by what We call a sailor captain-that is, a man who has been brought up to the seL We Lave never had a losg, nor hardly con e&m plaad ch a thlngas likely to happen when the ship was under the command of what is called a doctor captain, who Is a man that has been brought up to the medical profession, ham gone out to Africa as surgc on, and afterwards become a supercargo, And in this latter capadty had command of the ship. I think there Is not one case on record whero a medical man lost a ship belonging to this port engaged in the African trade; and before the paining of the Mercantile Marine Bill in 1850 doctor captains were very Common.

T1n LATE FLOoD.-The vast quantity of water which poured over the Hackney and Stratford marshes in the corse of Saturday, owing to the banks of the upper portion of the River Lea igiing way, continues to cver tne land for some distance. e water in some pas hbs greatly subidded, but in the lower portion of the marshes a large bod ins. That section of tho 2North-Wooltrich line of the Estern Counties which passes under the mai'. (London) road, is still aovered with water, thereby stopping the running of all trains from Biahopegate and Fenchure.- street to Woolwich and the Victoria Docks. On Saturday morning, when the water first came down, it reached a, depth of from five to six feet. On Sunday it was somewhat reduced, and yesterday it waa again materially dimlnished When the line, bowever is cleared, some further delay must take place before the trains can run, as the force of the torrent mnst have affected the permanent 'way. A number of houses adjacent to the line v'ere flooded, the lower fibors being filled with water, and the unfortunate inhabitants are considerable sufferers. The traffic on the Hackney.wick branch which joins the Eastern Counties at Stratford is also suspended, the rush of water having carried away some of the permanent road. A rumber of sheep, which were garaing in the marshes near, were drowned. DEAT}H OF AN AMHRicAN STA&TISAN..-The Hon. Louis M'Lane died yesterday, at hit residence in this city, in the 72d year of his age.

THE PANIC AT NEW YORK. (FRO.-I OUR ZBW YORK COREESPONDYNT.) NEW YORK, Ocr. 14. 7Picture to yourself the immense crowd that four :years ago lined the Strand to witness the funeral Vrocession of the Duke of Wellington, all clothed in ,masculine habiliments, the universal black smoke?pipe of London exchanged for the many-coloured 'slouched hats of New York, the smooth-shaved faces -covered with beards and the mouths draped with moustaches, the jolly English expression elongated And carewora, and the round cheek sunken; fancy those easy, careless sightseers thus metamorphosed all pressing into Lombard-street with a hurried, anxious pace, crowding and jostling their neigh'bours in their haste until compelled by their very numbers to drop into the slowly moving linei marehiug and countermarching up and down the coontre of excitement; imagine Lombard-street exp,anded to twice its length, and its trottoir enlarged -to more than twice the present w*dth,and every third -house a bank, with depositors or billholders bent upon obtaining gold for their debts, and you will 'have a real idea of the condition of WVall-street yesterday. New York was in a state of convulsion. A financial earthquake was rocking its moneyed institutions to their centre. One fell after another; shock followed shock; and, in the panic, no one felt sure that, at the day's close, anytfhing would be left to tell the tale of the wealth, *the comwercial credit, and the mercantile honour -of this community. This morning the partial sus,pension of yesterday has become general, and New York is now doing business on currency. On Saturday morning last it was announced that the Ilinois Central Railway Company had yielded to the storm, and had made an assignment; that the Erie had allowed its acceptances to go to protest; and -that the Michigan Central had, in the modest language of its Boston friends, deferred the payment of its floating debt. Some of the sugar acceptances maturing on that day were also left to go to protest, owing to the utter inability to get money. One house of litmited liability and undoubted means and credit was obliged to suspend with the best mercantile paper on hand only 15 days to run. Notwithstanding this Monday went by without a breakdown. There were several considerable failures, but nothing indicating a general breakdown. At 4 o'clock on Monday afternoon, after Kbanking hours, the clearing-house statement for the -week was made public. It showed, as oompared with the statement of a week previous, a Decrease of loans ...$ .. ... $4,017,930 Increase of specie ... . ... 75,881 Decrease of Lndrawn deposits ... 3,053,190 Decrease of circulation ... 224,668 Decrease by failure of capital ... G.56,000 -In other words, the banks had, in the face of the panic and the demand for money, proceeded with -their liquidations to the amount of $4,000,000. 'This statement shows, in rou nd numbers, a liquidation since the commencement of the panic of about $18,000,000 by the contraction of loans. In ordinary times, and with money at anything short of extraordinary prices, it would have been thoug'nt to be a favourable statsment. With a contraction of loans of over $4,000,000, and a payment of liabilities to depositors of over $3,000,000, the specie reserve had actually increased, notwithstanding aid known to be afforded to country banks, and the known fact that depositors had been making a run for gold. But in the present feverish state such a contraction was regarded as the precursor of still further trouble. Besides this I believe that the country banks brought an hostile influence to bear upon the city banks. The motives to this were twofold-ist. The domestic exchanges upon New York from all parts of the country are at such a premium as to entirely put a stop to all business. Not only is the transmission of gold Impossible, from the unwillingness to part with it, but the produce of the country is equally unavailable. Confidence is so entirely destroyed that the farmer will not sel to the local dealer; and the local dealer cannot forward to New York. At this moment Chicago is filled with grain which -he machinery of commerce affords no means of moving to New York, although Chicago owes New York and wishes to pay the debt, aud New York is suffering, dying I may almost say, from want of the remittance. The flinois Central Railway Company has a large amount In its Chicago Land-office for investment in its Construction Bonds. These bonds are selling hero at 50; it is ready to pay 65 for them in Chicago in the currency of that place; and yet nobody can be fouind to undertake the operation. This one illustration will show you how completely the business of the country is blocked by the unexpected and unaccountable destruction of domestic exchange. Its wealth becomes unavailable. The resources relied upon to get it out of its difliculties prove unavailable. Sterling exchange, too, naturally sinks under the pressure, and New York, the creditor of the country, is left to bear the brunt of the battle. The country banks, who feared that a continuance of the present state of things would drain them of specie for New York remittances, bave been naturally an xious to create a suspension here, in order by that means to restore the equilibrium in exchange, and prevent the drains of gold. 2d. They have also been influenced by the desire to protect their circulation. The currency of the interior is supplied by maeans of banknotes, issued upon a deposit of State securities with the Controller of the State. The stringency of the money-market has compelled the retirement of this circulation to a large amount, and the redemption of these securities for the purpose of sale. The amount thus forced upon the market has reduced the value of State Stocks. Simultaneously with this a new issne of bonds has become necessary for covering certain State canal liabilities. These securities have not been negotiable within the line required by law; it is reasoned that if specie payment be suspended in New York, there will again be a demand for country currency, and an upward turn given to State securities. There is reason to believe that the movements of yesterday were not entirely without concert of action. The final blow, however, was as rapid, and apparently as unpremeditated as the blow that brought about the French revolution of 1848; like that, there was a -concealed power that excited and directed the popular feeling. lThe first run yesterday was made upon the smaller banks outside of Wall-street, that afford accommodation and circulation for the tradespeople, artisans, shopkeepers, hotelkeepers, &c. These institutions were naturally in a less strong posi- tion than the bank-s doing business with the mercantile classes, and less able to stand a run. They opened at 10, and before 12 had fallen. 'Up to I o'ecl-ok everything was quiet inT Wall-street-as quiet, that is, as it has been any day for the past three weeks. There was a steady payment of specie over the counters to depositors, but nothing indicating a general alarm. Almost in an instant the street was crowded, and a run begun upon the American Exchange Bank, the weakest of the large institutions. I bad passed the Exchange a few minutes before; there was no appearance of unusual commotion. When I looked from my window there was a crowd of some hundreds (or -thousands rather) gathered in front, and a long line of bill-holders and depositora formed en que Mr. David Lemitt (of North American Tiust and Banking Company fame) mounted a step, and treated the crowd to the univereal Anglo-Saxon panacea-a speech; and the crowd partially dispersed, but the bil1-holders kept up the run. From every direction men now poured into Wall-streft. The marble steps of the Custom-house, the classic entrances to the banks, the noble spaces around the Exchange, the ugly stoopf (an inheritance from the architects of Amsterdam) that gave a ladderlike entrance to the offices, were aU alike quickly covered with curious spectators. The desks of the offices were deserted and the windowrs crowded. From the American Exchange Bank the attack was shifted to two or three banks further up the street. The Bank of America and the Mechanics' Bank were particularly selected. The stream of the anxious in-goers steadily increased; as they came out with hands filled and pockets bulging out with gold, some looked happy-more looked uneasy and foolish. From Wall-street the rush extended into Pine and Nassau, and the large Broadway banks; and before 3 o'clock the specie reserve was reduced to $5,500,000. The whole thing was as sudden as a tornado; the comparison also bears good as to the effect. Eighteenl banks fell, with a united line of loans of $21,000,000. The banking community of New York was called upon to liquidate in less than two hours. No bank could have stood the pressure. Last night those that had gone safely through the day met in council. The session lasted until 11 o'clock, and resulted in an unanimous agreement to suspend specie payment over the counter; to petition the Governor for a call of an extra sesson of the Legislature for the passage of laws to protect the banks, and prevent a summary and forced liquidation that would destroy aU the capital invested in them; and to resume specie payments at the earliest possible moment. I will not try to speculate upon the causes that have brought New York to bankruptcy at a time when there is more ictual wealth in the country than there has ever been before. If the West had made a vigorous exertion to pay its debts to New York, which mature at this time of the year, it would have been averted. There is plenty of property there, but an absolute inability to forward it. More than six months ago I wrote yon that when ths October and November diy goods' payments should mature there would be trouble, owing to the expanded state of the West. The intervention of the September panic has ohanged the anticipated pressure into a universal bankruptcy. The certainty of the pressure called upon the banks to maintain a bold front and a free line of discounts; instead of that, they were forced by their fears into an nnnatural contraction, which has brought them to their present condition. The example of the Conservative Bank of Commerce deserves commendation. In the midat of the contraction it has maintained its old line of discount almost unimpaired. Among the great failures outside of the banks three have especial interest for Englishmen. First is the Illinois Central, the stoppage of which will probably excite less surprise iu London than It did in New York. The notes payable of this company amount to $3,510,000, of which $2,400,0001. fall due previous to the 1st of January next, and the remainder in 1858. The optional scrip also falls due in January to the amount of S750,000. Aeainst this liability certain provisions had been made in London, the details of which I need not go into. Suffice it to say, that about three weeks since the company received authority to draw sterling bills to the amount of 200,0001. Unfortunately, there was no sale for exchange. The bills were offered. Erie wag also in the street with sterling credits; and exchange fell to a point where gold could be sent bere from London at a profit of nearly 10 per cent. It was irmpossible to contend against this, and on Saturday last it was announced that the company had made an assignment of all its property out of Illinois. Another instrument is being prepared, and is either executed to-day, or is to be this week, conveying the property within that State, thus divesting the corporation of its whole assets. The trusts provide for the expenses of runing, &c., and then prefer the endorsed paper on which the directors' names stand. Part of this had been previously taken up by sterling bills, but a large amount is still outstanding. Certain other claims, the payment of which is necessary to discharge collateral, are also preferred, and the remainder is charged with the general floating debt. The directors suppose that they have thus protected. the property against judgments, and that the company wiU be enabled to resume. No statement has yet been made to the public. Now York and Erie has also gone to protest; the property is still in the hands of the corporation, and no steps have been taken to sequestrate it. Some of the directors' friends charge gross mismanagement upon the late presiden0. At a public meeting of the friends of the route a week since I heard very strong language used on this subject, but no details have yet been made public justifying it. I believe it to be true, however, that that officer failed lately, owing the corporation some $75,000 or $100,000 for freight (he was a large lumber merchant) upon goods delivered in violation of the customary rules of the company, and under some special agreement. It may be that the rumours and charges grow out of this small but highly discreditable transaction. Three years since the corporation were advised (by an independent committee selected to examine their affairs) to require its president to abandon aU other avocations. The advice was declined, and we now wee the result. Michigan Central has also gone to the board, without any rumours of fraud or mismanagement. These suspensions must do away with the system of floating debts. The fall of all these corporations can be directly traced to this pernicious system. la the midst of such a general overthrow it is pleasant to see a railway with a good statement. The New York Central wiU show for the fiscal year ending September the 30th gross savings of more than $8,000,000, being au increase of more than $300,000, and wiU report itself as without any floating debt. It is also very agreeable to record the strength of the leading private banking houses. They bave had ample opportunity to strengthen themselves for the crisis. In the general suspension they are forced to pursue the samue course as the public banksnamely, suspend specie payment, except to specie depositors. Otherwise they would liquidate for the Whole community. But this ought not to, and will not, shake their general credit. They feel-indeed everybody must feel-that this country is rich, and that the banks and merchants only need act with a little more harmony th-an of late to make its wealth available.

I1BBLAKD. (IOM DOUB OMWN CORRZSPOPDXNT.) DUBLIa, MiONI&Y M[onDg. THE PRESSURE ON THE IRISH BANKS. The trade report in one of the Belfaat papers (the Mercury) thus refers to the feeble attempt to create a panic in two of the northerm banks last week:- "A very groundless panic was attempted to be set on foot in Bultast in the early part of the week respecting.the safety of one of our banks; and there was Ia run for gold,' which, however, only reached to the extent of a few thousands. Every demand was promptly met, not only at the head-office in Belfast, but a&. Armagh and the other branch establishments; and it was observable that, while the panicstricken were coming out of the bank doors with their 60 or 80 sovereigns, depositors were golng in with their thousands. The listrmst ic tle solvency o the bank only pervaded a very limited circlo of the humble and uninformed classes; and the better informed felt and feel thtt their funds are quite as safe in its keeping as if they were placed in the custody of the Bank of England." The report of the Banner of 17lster is to the following effect:- " The general business of Belfast, influenced by the present state of affairs in other seats of commerce, has been dull in nearly every department of trade. In wholesale houses the sales continue small, and country dealers pur chaw only to meet direct wants. Cash is sarce to famine, and the practice of hoarding which, more than all other influences, serves to increase a destitution in currenoy, is carried out to Its full extent. The present high prico for money leads many people to fear that the wealth of the cou-ntry is falling off, merely because cash has been artfficially pushed up, and yet the faot Is that the sources of real wealth in Ireland exhibit a healthier tone than at any former period o. our courtry's history. In the midst of all the effects of temDorary destitution in comnerce the railway receipts continue to show the prosperous working of the locomotive." With respect to the state of the staple tradle of Ulster the same authority reports as follows:- "If we were to argue from the appearance of the large bleach-fields in the neighbourhood of Belfast and elsewhere, in this and the next country, a very active state of business might be reported. Whatever dulness exists at the ware houses of merchants, there are no signs save those of activity at the bleach-fields. Sales of white goods for the past fortnight have been lower than at any period sinoe the close of the famine year. Hoiders, however, feel auite confident of the elaeticity of the trade, and do not appear anxioas to eell except at fair prices. Brown markets foe the week were not well a.tended by purchasers. Ballymena on Saturday last had a full share of webs, but owing to the current state of the cash market a great quantity stood over unsold. Armagh, on Tueeday, was equally dull - and at Tandragee no large transactions were mnarked off. turgan, on Thursday, was moderately supplied with plain and fancy good; but the market as a whole was quiet. There is no new feature in the yarn trade. Eillowners in man.v cases have reduced the number of their hands, and many of the spindles are idle. :FLx markets have been fully supplied with fibr; sales less inactive than oould have been antici. pated, and prices pretty firm. In inferlor qualities of fiax a reduction of 3d. or 4d. per atone may be reported. Top qualites of milled hold the full prices noted last wreek." THE RECENT TEA PRA1UDS. There are no tidings yet of the whereabouts of Mr. John James Moore, the ingenious Custons' swindler. On Friday an inquisition waa held at the sub-sheriff's office, in pursuance of a writ of extent which had been issued by the Court of Exchequer at the instance of the Crown, to discover what lands and tenements and what goods and chattels John James Moore, charged with being the prindpal in the late tea frauds, was seized and possess of at the date of the writ. The subjoined sketch of the proceedings is taken from the Northem Whig:- " Mr. William Welliugton Godfrey was examined by Mr. Smith as to the nature of Moore's property, He said that Moore was the tenant of a house, stores, and bonded waehouse in Sklpper-street, but his interest in that he conaldered io be merely nominal. Inx the front ofice of the shop there were 24 bags of cloverseed, worth about 1001.; there were in the bonded warehouse 137 packages of tek, the value of which, without the duty, he estimated at about 6001. Ho could not teU whether that tea was Moore's own; but, find. ing It there, he took for Wranted, until the contrary bad been provod, that It -was Moore's. There were in the yard aix casks of starch. which he valued at 181. There were two packages of coffee, value for about 151. He considered the furniture, gas-fittings, desks, &a., in the house, worth about 40Z. So far as he could ascertain from Moore's books, between bills or one thing or another, there was about 1,0001. dau to Moore, but he could not state what claims might be agadust him. In the whole, the roperty supposed to belong to Mloore amounted to 1,7731. We did not lcnow that there was any balance to Moore's credit in the bank. Mr. George Carrothers being examined stated that Mr. Geoghegan, of the Bank of Ireland, held a security of Moore's for 7001., on which 1401. had been advanced. Mr. Geogheran said it could not be expected that he would deliver up thIs document till all the bills drawn by Moore had been paid, but he thought they all would be paid. In answer to Mr Carrutbers, mr. Godfrey said, that 256 packages of tea had beenx moved by the Customs' authorities from Moore's bonding stores to the Cnstom-house stores. These 256 packages were valne for about 1,0001. Mr. Yoang inquired why the Customs' authoritfes took away these 256 packages and allowed 137 to remain in Moore's store? Mr. Godfrey replied, that it was because the former were warehotsed by Moore, while the latter were rot. Mr. Smith said that by the Customs' laws the authorities considered the 256 packpges forfeited. A question was then raised by Mr. Young and other l aro's as to wvhether certain wines, brandies, &c. belonging to Mr. Samuel Gelston, and warehoused in a store of Moore's rented by Mr. Gelston, and of which he kept the key, should not, prind facie, be eonsidered as Mfoore's property as weU as the teas found in Moore's stores, and ultimately it was tuled that they should be so considered. Mr. Gelston, who at first refused to attend the in uisition, ultimately came, a. the request of the sub-sheriff. He said he knew nothing of Moore, and dedared that he could rot form any estimate of the value of his wines and spirits, but they were worth, he should say, at all events, 2,0001. The pury ultimately found that there were 256 packages of tea In the Custom-house, removed from Moore's store, of the valuo of 1,0001.; that there was at present in the hands of the manager of the Bank of Ireland a certain security rr chargo on lands in Ireland, on which the directors of the Bank of Ireland have a lien, and which the jurors valued at 7001., less 1401., leaving 5601. of a balance; and the jurors further said that, at the time of taking the Inqui. sition, there were certain wiines and spirits in a cellar of the said John James Moore's store, which v.;nes and spirits have been claimed by Samuel Gelston as having been bonded by him, and in his name, and they found that these wines and spirits were of the value of, and did appraise them at the sum of, 2,000b" THE LATE 5T}E ROYAL IRISH DRAGOONS. It is stated that Colonel Dunne, the late member for Portarlington, has positively made an offer to the Horse Guards to raise in a short time, so as to be available for immediate active service, a regiment of Irish dragoons to fli the vacuum in the army list between the 4th Light Dragoons and the 6th Enniskhllens. The reduction of the Irish constabulary now being effected would probably be the means of furnishing a considerable number of recruits of the very best class for such a regimenttall, well-formed fellows, requirng comparati'ely but little drilling to render them efficient cavalry soldiers. Many of these men are already making preparations to departfor the United States, and the question is whether it might not be well to afford them a fair opportunity to serve their country by joining the ranks, of a corps to be composed, if such be the national desire, exclusively of Irishmen ? The Leinster Exlness, which has initiated the movement, gives the following sketeh of the late 5th Dragoons, and the causes which led to its disbandment .- "The 5th Royal Irish Dragoons were raised in 168S, and served with distinction under Marlborough, and no regiment in Her Majesty's service pursued a more glorious career up to the period of its preoipitate disembodiment. We bave documentary evidence before us to prove that the charge of disloyalty, upon which the regiment was disbanded, at best was very partial. The reeiznent having been very much reduced in numbers at the close of the Irish rebellion, in which they fought with bravery at Ross, Larkin-hill, Vinegar-hill, and Ballymore Eastace; but being obliged, from the losses they sustained, to recruit their numbers, several persons who had been involved In that insurrection, being desirous to escape detection, on its suppression erlisted in the 5th. Two deserters, named Feeny, having been taken prlsoners for a robbery, were admitted as evidence that a conspiracy existed in the regiment, and, although it is reasonable to suppose that disloyalty prevailed among the new accessions, it does certainly appear rather harsh that a regiment, which had for over a century proved itself equal in all the proud and honourable distinctions of brave soldiers, should be for ever condemned, They were disbanded for disloyalty, and their place in the Anrp Lstt remains a blank, ain insult to the Irish nation, wbich wi scarcely be deemed just by those who will look at the colours of the 18th, 87th, 88th, or the standard of the 8th Haussar, or 4th Dragoon Guards, not to calculate the viotories which decorate the banners oi regiments designated English and Scotch, but which were won by the aid of Irish soldiers, of which many of those corps are chiefly composed," THE LATEB iURDER IN TIPPERARY. The Nenagh Guardian supplies the following particulars of the shocking murder of Mr. John Ellis, a brief account of which appeared in The Tines of Monday : " Templemore, Oot, 23.-I have just time to stas' that M3r. John Ellis, steward to Mr. John Trant, Dovea, was brutally murdered last nigbt on his way home from this town. Re arrived here by the 4 o'cloc! train from Dublin and left shortly on his own car, which had been in waiting at the station, for his residence. When he arrived at Kilrush they found some bushes placed across the road, which the servant got down to take out of the way. He had scarcely stooped to remove the obstruction when his master was fired at from behind the dttch, and he received thecontentsofthe piece, which was hoevily leaded with slugs, through the body. He lived only an hour after. I have not heard if any person is yet arrested for the offence, but the pohee are on the alert, and I hope their efforts to secure the assassin wilU proe effectual. Mr. Ellis was a respectable andunoffending man. He was a native of Sootland, but hadbeen for a number of years in the emaploymern of Mr. Trant, by whom he was much respected for his integrity and upright discharge of his duties, and ha is sa;ij, to have been well liked by those wbo had InumediWte dealalg with him; but what mattered that in the estimAItiaa oE Tlppers7 aedmia? ar, Elio puxghasd ]atel. property in the Encumbered Esttes Court, and on the place aoming into hIS hands he was compelled to evict some tenants. This is the only cause that can be assIgned for the bloody and foul deed which has left a widow and, as I understand, nine helless orphans to hament the untimely end, and mourn the irreparable loss of as lovig husbkad and a good father." Another account says " As Mr. Ellis, steward to Mr. John Trant, Doves, Wva roeeeding to his residence at Killahara, from this town on Tnhrsday adgh, after returning from Dablin by the 11 p.m. train, and while he wes proceeding down a narrow road leading to his dwelling, he was fired at frorn behind a hedge on the right hand side of the road, and killed on the spot, several slngs having entered the unfortunate man's body, causing instautaneons death. The midnight assassins laid their hellish plan well. Bnshes were previously lAid across the road so as to interoept MIr. Ellis's passage, and it was while his servant hd alighted to remove the obstruc. tion the bloody deed was committed. Nothinghas been seen or heard of the perpetrators since. The only motive that can be assigned for this heinous crime is that deceased had served an ejectment Process on a tenant of his. Mr. Ellis had a sum of 901. in his pocket, but revenge not plunder seems to have been the object, and the money wr;s not touched." (BY ELECTRIC AND INMRNATIONT1 TELEGRAPH.) DUBLIN, Xom0.NAY EvmNxm . THIE BROADSTONE TRAGEDY. The Crown has sustained another defeat in the attempt to make James Spollen amenable to justice. The commission was opened to-day before Barons Greene ard Richards, and the latter having delivered his charge, the grand jury retired to consider the several bills sent up before them. After an absence of about two hours, they returned into court and the foreman announced that they had found "No bill" in the case of James Spolen, charged wit-h the robbery of the late Mr. Little.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME.S. Sir,-The following extracts from the Indian Journal of Bishop Reber are instructive, more especially as he is known tohave leanedrather to the side of caution and moderation in expressing hbis opinion in general, still more as to the church and the Indian Government. In the last letter he ever wrote to Mrs. Heber, he says "'Will itbe believed that vhile the (Tanjore) Rajah kept his dominions Christians were eligible to all the dif. ferent officea of State, while now there is an order of Government against their being admitted to any employ. ment. Surely, we are in matters of religion the most lukewarm and cowardly people on the face of the earth." Again, December 22, 1824, at Meerut :- "I went with Mr. Fisher to a small oongregation of native Christians. About 20 people were pre. sent-one, the naick or corporal, whom, in con. sequence of his embracing Christianity, Government verv absurdly, notm to say wiokBedy, disgraced by removing him from his regiment, though they still aIowe him hi s pay. He isa tall, stoat, plain-lookei man, wth every appearance of a re'pectable and e eUt-behaved soldier." Bishop Hebef's jornaey led him through the prinipal scenes of the present prutiy-Dinapore, Benares, Aivlran badi, gutte pore, Casnpore, Lucknow, Bareillt, AlmoraHb Meerut, Delhi, Agra, Ajmere, Neemuch, &c. Of Delhi his description is very interesting, and of the "open plain near Futtehpore, as aeem3ng marked out by nature for the scene of a great battle wbhich should decde the fate of the oountry." There is another passageis hisJournal not relating to India so muoh as to a controversy recently agitated in Palrliament and b the public pr-ess. It relates to divorce and remarriage, and shovs no' only wh Bishop Heber thought, but what he actually did in a case of this kInd at Benarescin September, 1a2w. The wifenof a native Chros. tman deserted her husband and then went to live with haother native. "The hnsband, about twa o years ago, applied to Mr. Frazer to marry him to another woman. r Mr. Frazer declined doing so, as no divorce had taken Place, on which he took the woman without marriage, and had nowr tw o children by her. For this he had been repelled from the communion, bat still continued to frequent the church, and was now very anious for confirmation. Atter some thought, I came to the conclusion that the man should be reprovei for the precipitancy with which he had formed his first connexion and the scandal which he had since occasioned, but that he might be admitted both to confirmation and the comlunion, and might be married to the woman who now held the place of a wife to him. It seened a case to which the rule of St. Paul applied, that if an unbelieving husband or wlfe chose to depart, on religious g.monds, from their believlng partner, this latter s, in consequence, free. At all events, as the runaway noman w as, if a wife, living ir, open adnltery, it was plain that he had a right to 'put her awray.' Though the laws ot the country provided him no remedy, yet, as a matter of conscience, this right might be fitly determined on by his religions guides, and I conceived myself warranted to declare him divorced and at liberty to marry aga:n. My determination gave great satisfaction to Mr. Frazer and MEr. Morrns, both of whom said that without some such permisslon the state of newv converts would be often very bard, and that the usual remedies sulpplied by the canonl law w ould be to men in such circumstances utterly unnttaJna'hle." I sm, Sir, YOUr obedient servant. J. veatnor, Isle of Wiaht4 Oct. 25.
SHIP WRECKS ONf THE COAST OF NORFOLE. TO TEE EDrTOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On the morning of Friday, the 234 inst., I learnt that three ships were on shore-one at Winterton, another at Waxham, and the third at Palllng. The two masts of that at WaxBarn wrere plainly discernmble from rmy windows, and as soon aa necessary duties had boen attended to I walked to the beach. The sun was shining brightly, the wind was luiled, and scarcely a breath moved the leaves. I shall not soon forget the appearance of the beach. A vessel laden with timber, chiefly deals, had been wrecked on Hasborongh Sands on Thursday, the 22d, but all hands, with the exception of the captain ard uate,who would not leave the vessel and were consequently lost, had been saved by a fisherman named Hewitt. For miles the, beach was strewn with deals, while the foam of the sea piled up In heaps in a continuous line, glittering%with rainbow tints, formed a painfuUy gay contrast to the sad sight which loomed in the distance. On my way to the bach I had, as continually as possible, kept my eye on the two masts but just be.ore I had ascended the boundary sandbank one had disappeared, a circumstar3e vwhich caused me some anxiety, as I had heard that several of the crew had taken ref Re from the breakers on one of the masts. On Diy arrival at the spot, I found that my fears were realized, four hands and (as I understood) a lad having been lost. Three men had regaiDed the vessel, which was on her side, with her bow away from the land, and her remaining mast to the leeward, in the position that would naturally follow from her being on her slde. I am a landsman, as aU nautical mcen will long since have discovered. The vessel was not two stones' throwv from the edge of the water; it seemed as though one could walk to her. Many persons were on the beach, and I asked what had been dore, and what was being done? In reply to which I heard the following account:- The vessel had struck at 2 o'clock in the morning, and l,ad broken her back a' onoe; that after much delay the chief boatman and two Coastguard men had fired rockets, commencing somewhere abo.t 5 o'clock, bat in vPitn. At daybreak they fired shot with the line attached, but frequently very wide of the mark, and when straiaht the rope had broken, not being a bit better as a farmer said, than one of his common plough lines. *hen I arrived at U1 o'clock there was no more powder, and every shot was gone. There was a difference of opinion as to the number of shots fired, but I heard from pretty good authority that there had been 16 shots and 101b. of powder expended, and aU without effect. Had any of these shots been attended with success, it is neediess to say that the lives of the four men woould, in all human probability, have been saved. There was a boat belonging to the ship, on shore, and when I proposed manning her the objection was that sbe wight be too smaUl, and ihat there were no oars,-moreover, that a coble (i. e-, a large boat) had been sent for from Winterton, which would not have been the case had not Mir.Rising, of Somerton, a p.nvate individual, guarar'teed the payment of the expenses, if not met by others. About half-past U o'clock the captain of the Coastguard arrived on horseback, an, finding there was no powder, asked whether more could be bought?s A warreer near offered to supply what he had, which proved to he llb., but then there were no shots, and the cautia galloped off to procure some. ALI this time the breasers were occasionally washing over the three survivors, although, as the tide was running out, there was every prospect of their ultimate safety, and they were saon able to get under the lee of the bov bulwarks. The patience of the men on the beach became exhausted, and they were in the act of launching their little boat (baving obtained oars), when the coble hove in sght, drawn by two or more horses. The captain returned with the shot, and again the first was fired in vain; it was toe much to the south and someething was wrong in the gear. At the next fire a lne was thrown over the wreck, but at that time ti-e coble was launched, and steered under the mast, whence the men were taken irto her. After receiving refreshment they were sent on to Yarmouth, but not before one of their mressmates had been thrown by the waves upon the beach. At Palling, I n an, an attempt was made to launch the lifeboat, but in vain, and all hands, four in number, perished. On the same evening one body -was washed on shore at Palling, two more at HForsey, and the other, beforenamed, at Waxbaam It was asserted by one who ought to know that, in case otber vessels were on shore that night, there was no powder or anything else that was necessary for their safety, and when the xamark wps made that application sbould be made at heod-quarters, the answer was, that they might then get them in two months, as on the last occasion the party knew it was three months after the application before the Coastguard obtained what they required. I krow not how these facts may strike you, Sir, but I must think that if the Coastguard are to be employed on these dreadful occasions they ought to be frequently exercised in the requisite duties, that the stores supplied should be tested, and that there ought never to be a deficiency of the means to be employed for 'he safetv nf life.

THE INYDIAN MUTINIS. TO THE EDITOR OF ETUE TIl . #ir,-With all deferenoe to your Able correspondeno "Indopbilus," I think he haw failed to make out bitTffse irs the letter which appears In your columns of to-doe, And It is somewhat remarkablo that the argamonts of mm opposing counsel at Agra should appear in juxtapositio. with those of your home coreepondent; and altbough he reserves his opinion as to the caue of the mutiny for a future oemmunlication, yet he says qaite enough to show that kMvwholly rejects the conclre*on arrived at by Indophilu.4' a5id Colonel eykes, thst tbsexclting cause of this nmentable revolt of the Bengal army -sas the greased exrtrdges. At tie same time I must free?y dmit tbat your Agta correspondent platnly asserts thab althoung Pit nay turn out tlkt'many of the recent insusrect ions Nare been fomented by Mahbmedan princes, penssinen, anTd tanatita? priesta, it woul'd be a mistake to considevr this unevement asspcfrell Malromedan in its origin." Wa?ins4t; thenJ!ore, &ait*it?s what patience we may the fuxturae oommun5cation or '1 n vcstigator"ttb learn what, In his opinias constEtutestBa-causes or causes of the terrible calamity. Meanwhile " indophilu," hu imldbrtkei in the ?itter before rme the task of tracing this' t-* Its soume, and, persuaded himself that he has penetra*d' ita untAmst depthts,declares it to consist in religious f zy-a paroxymi2 of fanaticism. And what are the grounds given h2r this cenclilon First, he refers to what he terms the predisposing- catises,. and these he correctly states to bel ong partly to tle* "cnnstitutlon of the Bengal aey ne and the tw, element-in this constitution to which he points aro the hi*' degree of 'religious susceptibility possessed by the army and its unequalled power of combination. But, while it is admitttd that these form to some extent cause for apprehen;Aon, the latter especially, yet your correspondent appears to have overlooked wLhat to my mind forme tbe chief eleraentof dauger in the constitutio* of the Angal army-natnsly, its being composed of the conquerea race. Believing my3elf-that certain feelings of independence are common to the hum&u race, I cannot but see a.frditfpredisposingeAme of ievols in the fast of the army of the oonquerors and dominant rulers of a country being composed of the subject race. There vws much, perhaps, to-delhde us into the belief that such an army must always reunain faithful to the alien invaders of their country; tliat the Eindoo was mild and apathetic and content to remain a boadsman, even when he might think he possessed the power to strike an effectual blow for his freedom. But It was to believe in an .inapossibility; and this is what we kave to guard against most sedulously in the future mility reorganization of onr Eastern empire. The operatiorn of the second predfisposing cause of themutiny specified by youa correspoident would wholly depend upon his being co22ect in attributing the outbreak to"outraged religious feelings," or fear of their religion being. interfered with; and I ax free to confess that I cannot give the Brahmin Sepoys-the "military priests," as "Iu-- dophilus" terms them-credit for so ranch foresightedness and logical deduction. It is vain, however, to dogmatizeon the subject. The amnaring fact, is that we should stil be left to speculate in the matter, for srely there must be - hundreds among the native ofcers and men who have remained faithful among the haithier able to solve the problem, and say whether it was, as 'Iudvophilus" supposes, a sudden and unpremeditated ebullition of religious frenzy, or the imperfect result of a long concerted plot. To me it has all along been inexpliUable, and one of the worst features in the whole affair, that up to the present time no one should have divulged the true cause of the murderous outbreak. All that your correspondent sr graphically describes of the history of the greased cartridges does not in my opinion in the least militate against the conclusion that tho mutiny is the result of a deep laid Mlahomedan plot to overthrow our rule. All that took place with the cartridgcs might equally happen at the instigation of seditious and disaffected Mahomedans; and it is such an vnasual thing,-a perfect anomaly, in short,-for a low caste magazine Lawar to ask a Brahnin Sepoy to) let hixm drink out of his lotah that the circumstance impresses me very strongly with the belief that it was a preconcerted thing, a cunning scheme of the plotters to entrap the smupicions and weakmindod Hindoos, and thus pave the way to carry the Hindoo soldiery with them. The evidence brought forward by " Indophilus " to prove that the Mahomedan population were taken by surprise, and that the !Mahomedan soldiery were only followers in the insurrection, I consider of no weight whAtever when compared 'with the multitudinous proofs of the Moslem soldiery being the foremost on every ccason, and the most fierce and unrelenting of raL For my own part, I do not believe, that terror for his religion or the belief that he 9 was forcibly to be made a Christian would alone have induced the Eindoo Sepoys to revolt; and I doubt, moreorer, if they ever were made to bellevo-I mean the mas-that the Government really intended to enforce Christianity upon tbem. Aware of the intense avarice of the Brahmnin Sepoy, I am far more di& posed to think that the most powerful argumens with most of them was tho ssurace of large plunder, i3, the whole of the treauries in the country being in the custody of guards from their own body. I need only refer to your Agra correspondent's statement to show tbat, whatever " Indophilus " may think to. the contrary, there were both plan and combination, and of such A nature that had they been fully matured before acted upon we might have lost every fortress in the Bengal Presidency, and perhaps the life of every European therein. The premature outbreak destroyed the unanimity of action, and would quite explain the manner in which the various regiments aced afterwards. They were disconcerted by the promature discovery of their plot, and knew mot how to act. Tho more daring were for going forward, the timid and the better affected hesitated, and contests occured. Nothing that " Indophilus " has brought forward in his letter seems at all calcuLated to dispel the belief so generally held by men on the spot that the Mahomedams are at the bottom of the mischief. And depend upon it, Sir, the Moslem is our difficulty in India. To use the expression of a friend, they are the "slowmAtchinalloar maggaznes,"and the question is whether we can ever get on peaceably without dis. arming them entirely. Some of the Zemindars require perhaps a few armed mon. But every OnD allowed to hav& arms should hold them under a license from the Government, but if found with more than the number allowed, or ny person found with Arms without a license, transportation should be made the penalty, and oa no account vhat. ever should they be allowed to possess any cannon. "Indophilus" denies that the Seyoys have used the &eased cartridges against our people, but in a letter from Benares received by the last mail I am &ssured that ti;e mutineers from Dinapore freely used against Major Byre's 'arty the Enfield rifle and ammunition of the men of Her Majesty's 10th who fell in the unsuccssful attempt to relieve Arrab. I am, Sir, yoUr most obedient se,Avatn J. H. 3ACDONALD, Lieutensnt-OoloneL Oct. 23.
ROAD RBEFOR31. TO THE EDITOR OCF THIE TIMES. Sir,-Having zead your most admirable article onl Mr. Hamilton Nisbet's opposition to the road reform in East tothian, I would call your attention to the excellent work-. ing of the oounty assessment for the repair of roads la Ireland, to the satisfaction of both those who mse-the roads and. the landowners through whose property tbey pas. I believe that at this moment there is not a single turn. pike in Irelabd. May I suggest to Mr. Hmilton _Nisbet that the cost of repairing the streots of a .ity is much larger than that of repairing counaty roads, and is paid for by the inhabitauts of the city, the great mutority of whom are men of businmes and shopkeepers. The lndowners, though naking ample use of the streets, pay nothing towards heir maintenance. Why, then, should thebdty mer pay for their use of the county roads ? Your oh2iit. t A CCXSTiN? READER.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (FrROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) [A portion of the following appeared In our soond edt. lion of yesterday:-] rA&U5, -.INDAY I 1N5XG, OcT. 25. The proceedings against M. Migeon, the successful candidate for the Haut-Rhin, have not done much credit to the authorities that instituted them, and the decision of the Correctional Court of Colmar, declaring its incompetency except on the single point of the iUegal use of the decoration, embitters the disappointment. It is said that M. Migeon will appeal against the sentence of one month's imprisonment pronounced for that offence. From the evidence of their own witneases, the authorities have been clearly convicted of employing the same " electoral frauds" for which they prosecuted M. Migeon. Supposing him to have had recourse to such'means, it is mortifying to find that, with the abundant and powerful resources which they had at their commnand, thev have been beaten on their own ground by an individual who relied only on his personal popularity, well or ill bestowed, and whom the rural electors persisted in regarding as the real candidate of the Government Lt could not be from any newv-born zeal for personal or political morality that the prosecution was decided upon, for the authorities had been long acquainted with the facts which formed its groundwork, and no one more ardently defended him from these charges in 1852, and which are now alleged as disquaifying him from a seat in the Legislature, than the Procureur himself. To such a point was this indulgence carried that the Minister of Justice, in a letter, dated September, 1856, requested that functionary not to take proceedings against M. Migeon for wearing the decoration of the Legion of Honour, unless he again committed an infraction of the law. No such infraction appears to have occurred, but the election in which the Government candidate was defeated took place last June. The wearing of the decoration (which, however, was controverted by the witnesses of the defendant, among whom was a functionary of the Government) was adduced by the prosecutor as one of the means employed by M. Migeon in his canvass. This, however, was refuted successfully by the defendant's counsel, and was scouted by the Court. The electors could not be persuaded by Prefects or Sub-Prefects that M. Migeon had ceased to be an object of interest and affection on the part of the Government, nor would they believe that his fall from innocence impaired his influence in quarters where, however, innocence is not always the most prized. Up to the last moment letters were addressed to him from patriotic brigadiers of gendarmerie and others, replete with declarations of love of country, attachnient and devotednese towards himself, andgenerally ending by expre,sing the fitness of the writer for advancement. When the hostility of thePrefect to the popular candidate was known, the electors were astonished and incredulous. The Sub-Prefect was asked to explain the fact; this bold citizen replled that there was no explanation to give, and, accordiDg to the evidence of a witness, added, that when people mean to get rid of a servant they turn him off without alleging any reason for what they do. The members of the Legislative Corps cannot be otherwise than flattered at this description. The legislators display, it is true, an uniform, but till now the embroidered coat was not formally declared to be a livery. The wearing of the decoration of the Legion of Honour withouthaving received the proper diploma was a silly exhibition of vanity, but no moral crime. For the title of Count, which M. Migeon prefixed to his name, there was some foundation. M. Mi-eon, if not a Knight of the Legion of Honour, is, it appears, a Commander of the Roman Order of St. Sylvester, and that commandership confers tho title of " Count Palatine." It may be had, I believe, for 1,000 francs by any one; but It is curious that in a country where democratic notions prevail one should witness so strong a passion, particularly among the bouirgeoisie, for assuming aristocratic distinctions. M. Migeon's title of Count has been, as these things go, a fair bargain; but, cheap as it is, there are not a few caUing themselves Counts or Marquies who have not complied even with the triling formality of payment. The latter class is, perhaps, the most numerous. Princes are not, except among Italians and Russians, very numerous; Dukes are rather less scarce; Marquises are pretty abundant; but of Counts and Barons the name Is legion. You may meet -with them any day as candidates for subordinate employment under Government or in the railroads. It is said that in some of the bourgeois circles of Paris orders are given to the servants on reception nights to announce every guest by some title or other. At what precise period or for what reason Count Migeon forfeited the friendship of the Government is not clearly stated; but the feeling of the public decidedly is that the Colmar prosecution was the result of irritation at his success. It was stated in evidence that, pending the election, it was announced that proceedings would be taken against him, but only in case of his success, and it Is certain that one or more of the Mayors were dismissed from their post in consequence of it. Yet, in spite of appearances, it is well to bope that the Government has been actuated in this matter by a spirit of morality. Those who adopt a new faith are often found to be more impulsive and zealous than old believers, and allowance ought Wo be made for the excessive enthusiasm of the neophyte. The trial at Colmar has no doubt produced disclosures which it might be prudent to haTe avoided, and the authorities might have remembered the homely but expressive recommendation of the first Napoleon, " laver son linge sale en famille." The process, however, has been gone through in sight of the public. People will, I trust, do better in future. A new era of political virtue is now inaugurated; and Cato the Cersor himself never was more rigid than we shall be in future. A speech from the Throne always opens the Legislative Session. It might now be advantageously followed up by a discourse from the President of the Legislative Corps on the morality of public men. Count de Morny might dwell on the various charges which disqualify a man for political life; he might enlarge on the impropriety of public functionaries gambling on the Bourse, and of using political station and influence for sordid and personal advantage. He might also grow pathetic in exhorting his colleagues to avoid giving scandal by the disreg,ard of morals; he might fling his sarcasm on the upstart vanity that uses titles and nobility without the slightest claim to them; and he might denounce the understanding of little morals better and observing the great ones not at all. Such an address would, I doubt not, produce considerable effect, coming from such a source. It might be an innovation, but the experiment is worth trying. M. Henri Cauvain returns, in the Oonstitutionne of to-day, to the question of the passport system. He is more diffuse, but not more clear, than in hiss first essay; yet the point is very simple. Re maintained that passports are employed as a security against revolution, He stated aS the same time, and now reiterates his statement, that France has her revolution-that Is, that sshe changes violently her forn of government-every 15 years; and that England, without passports, bas had no revolutions for more than a century and a half. It is clelr, then, that passports are ineffectual in preventing political convulsions in this country, and that tranquillity is fully maintained in England without them. The inference is obvious; passports are a useless nuisance. ML Cauvain says that F_rance ha Its revolution every 15 years. Does the Con-titu- jionnel, a Government paper, really believe that the present regime, which began in December, 1851, in fact if not in name, has only seven or eight years more to run? for it does not say that the period of revolutions is closed, and what it shows to have happened at stated periods may happen again. What would be said if the Fusionist Spectate,urortheLegitimlist Union gave such hints about the fragility of the Imperial rule? The Constitutionne! seems to have assumed the office of the slave who stood behind the chariot of the Roman emperors to ad.monish them, amid the roar of triumph and the incense of adulation, that they were still mortal. The duty is a high moral one, though the monitor is not always acceptable. I doubt whether the Emperor will be obliged to the Constitutione for the hint. Some time after the signing of the treaty of peace with Russia a commemorative medal was struck, with the proud device, taken fromVirgi, "Peecatnm reget patriis irttutibus orbem." The medal thus foreshadowing the greatness of Napoleon IV. was distributed to the Ambasadors of the Great Powers, whether to be worn by them on State oecasions or not I am unaware. The Constitutionnel evidently has not received one, or no doubt would be suggested of the durability of the Empire. The Cvitutiutonel Is indignant against the dangerous and perverse men"who are wont " to conceive and prepare their criminal designs in England," or who penetrate into France from other parts to carry out those designs. This is clearly an allusion to the Strasburg and Boulogne expeditions, which, it seems, were not prevented by the passport system. This is not bad for a Government paper. M. Cauvain lays great stress on the conduct of the English Government after the battle of Culloden, and adduces it as a case In point in favour of passports. He also dwells upon the occasional suspension of the Habeas Corpus when whole districts were in a state of armed insurrection. Well, England has a Habeas Corpus, though it may occasionaUy be suspended. Has France one? Bit it is difficult to discover what analogy there is between Englanddisturbed by insurrection raore than a hundred years ago and France tranquil in 1857. it is not true, as M. Cauvain Intimates, that malefactors are impeded by passports. Let him show that criminals invariably escape capture and punishnment in England through the want of passports, and that by this means every offender against the law is brought to justIce in France, and then we shall know what to say about the matter. In truth, M. Cauvain is quite enamoured of the passport system, and seeme to look with pity on those who do not cherish the se affection. He in of opinion that England wil some day or other adopt the custom. I only hope he wiU not defer his visit to that country ti then. ML Mon arrived at Bayonne at 10 p.m. on Wednesday,on his way to Madrid from Rome vid Paris. After having read the despatches, which were brought from Madrid by a courier extraordinary with orders to deliver them to x Mon wherever he should meet him, the latter left Bayonne for Madrid. General Pria arrived at Bayonne on Thursday on his way to Madrid. A letter from Gaiatz, of the 3d inst., Informs us that the French steam cutter Salamandre, favoured by a flood in the Danube, was able to cross the banks at Slina, and to anchor at Galatz on the 3d inst. The French Commissioner had determined to visit the Iron Gates, for which purpose Captain Roussin, of the French Imperial navy, had paced the gunboat Meurtribre at his service. The Russian and Prussian Commi sioners were about to perform a similar journey, accompanied by a Prusian engineer, for the purpose of ascertaining the best mode of widening a narrow passage by which the navigation of the Danube is completely interrupted during a part of the year, and which is always dangerous in consequence of the rapid currents and the numerous rocks. Although this section of the Danube is not comprlsed in the labours submitted to the European Commimsion, it is expected, nevertheless, that the Commissioners will be authorized to direct their attention to it. They have proceeded there in an Austrian steamboat. There are 400 miles between Galatz and the Iron Gates. It is not known whether the state of the waters in the Danube,which are very low, will permit the Meurtri%re and the Russian steam cutter Ordonnance to arrive at that point. The currents, however, are at this moment very weak, which is one point in their favour. A letter from Genoa, of the 23d inst., states that the late floods havo caused great damage In the provinces of Biella, Casale, Mondovi, Susa, and Pigneroles. The telegraphic line between Turin and Genoa waa completely restored on the 23d. The line from Novara was still interrupted. The King of Sardinia had visited the works, accompanied by Count Cavour, Chevalier Negretti, Special Commissary of the Novara Railway; Chevalier Ronco, Chief Engineerof the Victor-EmamnuelRailway; and Chevalier Rovere, Chief Engineer of the district. The King most graciously thanked all those who, by their unwearied ifforts during three days, preaerved the bridge sf the Stura from destruction. PRUSSIA. (imx ou0 owir co BBxsowDmir.) BERLIN, Ocr. 24. The King's mental health continues to improve now as steadily as lis bodlly state had progressed for some little time past, and it has been found practicable to lay before him the necessity of his empoweg the Prince of Prussia to act for him temporarily, and to procure his consent to execute the necessary document. Yesterday afternoon, at halfpast 3 o'clock,the Minister-President was summoned to Potsdam by telegraph, to conduct the execution of the Cabinet order, having the effect of a power of attorney, which, as I learn, took place as follows :-The physicians in attendance on the King first testified to their conviction that His Majesty was now of sufficiently strong and clear mind thoroughly to apprehend the signification and importance of the act suggeated to him; and then the King, after reading aloud the text of the document submitted to him In a clear tone, audible to such members of the Royal Family as were present, sig,nified his acquiescence in its contents, and signed it. The document empowers the Prince of Prussia to conduct the business of the kingdom in his brother's name for the space of three months. As it is far from probable that the King can entirely recover his strength of mind and body within the short space of three winter months, it may be fairly concluded that this term wil form only the preliminary introduction to a formal regency, during ! which the King will be in a position to travel about either in his own dominions or in foreign countries. This form of settlement of the crisis at Potadam wlll not be without a very disturbing influence on r the wedding arrangements of the Princess Royal and Prince Frederick William. As the Prince of Prussia Wil, in consequence of his holding this power of attorney, be prevented from going over to England to be present at his son's nuptials, it is more than possible that the marriage itself will be postponed for a short time. Such a postponement would in many respectabe desirable, inasmuch as, amongother reasons, if the ceremony takes place later in the year there will be a better chance of its being favoured with fine weather, which, as far as the Berlin portion of the ceremonies is concerned, is a consideration of very great importance, inasmuch as the entry into Berlin of the bridal couple entails upon a large number of old civic notabilities the necessity of confronting the severities of the open air in those curtailed unmentionables that seem everywhere to form an essential of Court costume. Quantities of young girls,too, wiU go out of the city gates to receive the bride, themselves dressed in bridal attire, and it would be a grievous pity if rain or other Inclemency of the weather should mar the effec.' of white satin shoes and low dresses, and consign their wearers to a bed of sickness or an untimely grave. It is also very desirable for the position that the youthful couple shaU subsequently occupy in the hearts of their future subjects that all Prussia should be able to look back to that day of thelr entry into Berlin as a day of sunshine. According to the latest arrangements, Prince oFre derick Wiliam will go to England in the early part of next month, and stay at our Court until after the birthday of the Prncess RoyaL There are two offical builetins, that of yeserday and that of this morning, which I might send you ; but, little value as they have ever had, they have still less now that all immediate danger to His Majesty's life is at an end, anld that a definite state of things has at last put an end to the very unsatfactory suspenion of all Government business. This morning at 12 o'clock the Prince of Prussia, after giving the Miniter-President a very long audience, received the rest of the Ministers of State at his palace, and, in connexion with the event which had already been brought to their knowledge, of the King's having intrusted him with a power of attorney in the shape of a CabInet order, expressed, with some emotion, how deeply he felt the responsibility of the task that had fallen upon him, and how earnestly he desired that the King might speedily be again in a poition to resume the reins of governmnent. The Cabinet order above referred to is as follows: " TO TH PRNCE Or PxUSsA.

AUSTRIA. (]MON OUR OWN OORBM ODtDM.) VIENwNA, Ocr. 23. There has recently been a marked change in the opinions of more than one of the continental Powers on the subject of the re-organization of the Danubian PrinciDalities. The intelligence contained in my letter of the 17th inst. relative to Messrs. de Boutenieff and de Basily was strictly correct, for' those statesmen are not only dissatisfied with the present state of things in the two Principalities, but they are opposed to their union under a foreign prince. The Prussian Government has also considered it advisable to inform the public that, although it objected to the first Moldavian elections, it is not inclined to give its support to any party which may attempt to encroach on the rights and privileges of His Majesty the Sultan. As the foreign publc does not know by name the leaders of the ultra-Liberal party in WaLlachia and Moldavia, it would be useless to give a list of the members of the Divans ad iwc, but it may be well to state that the following gentlemen were at the head of the revolutionary movement in the Principalities in 1848:- Nicholas Golesco, the Vice-Preident of the newlyelected Wallachian Divan; Constantine Rosetti, Demetrius Bratiano, Stephen Golesco, its secretaries; and General Tell and M. Marghiloman, its questor3. One of the abovementioned names cannot fail to produce an unpleasant impression on the mind of the Emperor of the French. M. Bratiano, who represents the Argis district in the Divan, was so strongly suspected of having had cognizance of the " Op6ra Comique" plot that his name was, and still is, in the worst possible odour at Paris. The members of the commission at Bucharest have forwarded to their respective Governments a mnore or less detailed account of what occurred in Moldavia and Wallachia during the elections, and some of them are said to ha;ve stated that the second elections were even more ilegally conducted than the first. The following facts have been comnmunicated by persons of high respectability who were at Jassy before and during the elections in Moldavia: -The Eaimacan wvs ordered by the Porte on the 24th of August to revise the electoral lists "upon the basis of the interpretations I given at Bucharest to certain doubtful points in the electoral firman." Instead of folowing the instructions received Prince Vogorides deprived the committees of the right to examine into the validity of the reclamations of persons whose names ought, if the Walachian interpretations had been followed, to have figured on thne electoral lists. On the 14th of Augulst the MIoldavian Government agreed to allow the committees to examine the electoral lists, but stiUl it continued to act as if no such bodies existed, inserting or erasing names aceording to its own good pleasure. At Berlad two Greeks, named Pogonate and Jouvare, were entered as electors by special order of the Government, although they were not naturalized Moldavians. The Minister of '-e Interior was dismnissed because he declined to put into execution orders that were not in keeping with the instructions which the Kaimacan had received from the Porte. The Minister's successor is the aide-decamp'of the Raimacan, and he naturaUy executes the behests of his master to the letter. Before the second elections took place all the prefects of the districts were dismissed by the Kaimacan without the knowledge of the Administrative Council, and their places given to aides-de-camp and secretaries of the Prince. In conclusion, the names o. no fewer than 23 members of the Moldavian Divan ad hoc are given vrho have no righit to the seats which they occupy in that assembly. On or about the 12th or 13th inst. the Austriaa Government forwarded a circular to Its diplomatic agents abroad, in which it was said that the union of the Danubian Principalities could not be decree I by a majority of the parties to the treaty of the 30th of March, because that document distinctly says that the question of the re-organization of the two provinces canno. be definitively settled without an accordance between the Porte and the Powers. I, is credibly related that this Cabinet has spoken much more openly and positively on the subject than is its wont, but if so it is probably fighting battles against windmills, for not one diplomatist in ten now believes that the majority of the great Powers wish for the political union of Moldavia and Wallachia. The rumour that a reconciliation is about to take place between Austria and Sardinia again prevails, but it is without any foundation. Both Powers are content to leave matters as they are for a time, as the interruption of their diplomatic relations is attended with no inconvenience. The communication between the two count,rie5 is not only not im- peded, but a convention has recently been concluded for the more expeditious conveyance of passengers, goods, and money from Sardinia to Aistria, and viCe vt-vsd. The Russian Embassy in this city has hitherto made great difficulties whenever it has beea the question of giving a visa to the passport of aa Austrian who wished to go to Rusia, but the system has been changed, . and in futurs all Austrians will be permitted to cross the frontiers into Russia if they are not persons whose entrance into Russia is expressy prohibited-barrelorgan men, vendors of plaster of Paris casts, pedlars, mountebanks, or vagabonds. It is related in higher circles that Prince Richard Metternich, who now represents Austria at the Saxon Court, is likely to be sent as Austrian Minister to St. Petersburg. The mission of M. Benedetti to the Court of Sardinia affords matter both for reflection and speculation here; and the Idea that the Emperor of the Frenh is about to interfere more directly in the affairs of some of the Italian States is very strongly impressed on the minds of the professional politicians of Vienna. It is recollected that M. Benedetti was formerly on very intimate terms with Prince Napoleon, and that the latter is not in very good odour here need hardly be aid. One of the morning papers contains the following brief but pithy notice in regard to MA Benedetti's journey to Italy:- " According to reliable advices from Italy, the journey of M. Benedetti, the director In the Foreign-offioe in Paris, ha. a political object, as has abso the journey of General Goyon the commander of 'he French troops in Rome, to Naples4 The French C-overnment wishes to impres3 on the minds of the principal employ4 in the different Italian States the Aecessity for tho reforms whichi are required by the Wcsteran Powers, and also to have an exact account of the actual state of things and of public feeling in Italy." A person who generally has a good insight into what is passing in the world this morning remarked that the Emperor Napoleon was evidently much inclined " to put the screw " on the Pope, "w who had repeatedly declined to go to Paris to anoint him." We learn from St. Petersburg that the intriguing Quean of Greece actually did propose to the EmperorsNapoleon and Alexander while at Stuttgart to alter the treaties relative to the succession to the Greek throne. Her Majesty represented, that in case of the demise of King Otho without children there would be an interregr*m, as his two brothers had declared their resolve not to embrace the Greek faith, and concluded by proposing that the three protecting Powers-England, France, and Russiashould take the necessary steps for making Prince Elimar of Oldenburg the heir presunmptive to the ihrone of his brother-in-law, King Otho. The Queen of Greece reached Trieste yesterday, on her way from Ischl to Athens. Her Majesty was accompanied to Trieste by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg. Some days since you learnt from me that no Austrian veteran had received the St. Helena medal, but the ztateraent was not quite correct. An ancient warrior in Graz, in Styria, claimed his shareof the legacy bequeathed byNapoleon I. tohis soldiers, but instead of money he to his great displeasure, received by post a St. kelena medal. The census has just begun in Austrla, both for cattle and for human beinga. The finance world of Vienna is just now divided into two parties-the one party is of opinion that the Bank eaght to raise its rate of discount (which is 6 per cent.), and the other declares that such a measure would be worse than useless. The semi-official Srbsin Koene thus announces to the inhabitants of Servia the discovery of the conopIracy against the life of their Sovereign " For some time past the polico authorities have recelved communications relative to an Impious attempt that ws to be made on the life of hbs Highnes our gradous Lord and Prince. It is painful for us to have to state that the Senators Radovan Damianovitch and Paun Jankovitch were two of the conspirator Positive proofs are in the hands of the authorities that all the necessary preparations for the perpetration of the horrible crime were made, and eyen the instrument with which ocr good Prince was to have beert murdered is in their poesesslon. Under such circumstances the authorities could not but arrest tho abovementioned persons and others who are accused of having been concerned in the abominable plot.

The liabilities of Dr. Zugschwerdt amount to 499 000ff. (49,0001.), and his assets are 182,000ff.; 43, . belonged to minors, and were embezzled by Zugschwerdt, who was their tutor. The claim of Wertheimsteins, Sons, on the estate of the bankrupt is 150,000fl., but the house is extremely rich, and consequently is not likely to be inconvenienced by the loss. The broker Lichtensteinloses97,000fL, the banker LUwenthal 50,000ff., M. Schey 30,000fl., M. Lindheim, one of the founders of the ViennaLinz Railroad, 20,000ff., Messrs. Rothschild, Mumann, Liammel, and Wodianer escape with a loss of but 10,000fl. each, but several other persons have lost their all by the ci-devant member of the Board of the Credit-Bank. The only Vienna firm which is likely to lose much by Balabio, of Milan, is Baron Sina. When in Paris, a few weeks since, the Italian asked the Vienna banker to direct his house to give him oredit to a certain amount. The request was granted, and the Vienna Orcesus is now in possemsion of Balabio's bills to the amount of 80,000fl. A few months ago the house of Rothschild did a great deal of business with B3alabio in Lombardo-Venetian railroads, but it is said to escape with a loss of no more than 600Z. The Italian banker was the correspondent and agent of the great St. Petersburg house of Stleglitz. At 1 o'clock on the 19th inst. a alight earthquake was felt at Trieste. The Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom has just permitted 13 political fugitives to return to their homes. Count Buol will leave Carlsbad on the 30thinst., and go by way of Teplitz and Dresden to Mamnheim, where the Countess, his wife, is now staying. On or about the 10th of November the Minister will resume his official duties. M. Niederhofer, the director of the Prusso-Moldavian Bank, ha.s entered into negotiations with Captain Magnan, and a Prusso-French Danubian Steam Navigation Company is likely to be formed. The foreign world evidently fancies that the banks of the Danube are a kind of Eldorado, for the Russians also talk of navigating the river. TURKEY. (FRONX OIJR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) CONSTANTINOPLE, Ocu. 17. The Commission for settlng the Turco-Russian frontier in Asia has returned to Constantinople, with the exception of the Russian Commissioner, who is expected by the end of this month. Your readers will remember that according to the treaty. besides the two Powers directly interested in the settlement of this frontier line, who sent each two Commissioners, France and England had to send one each. The Commissioners were, on the side of Turkey, Hussein Pasha and Osman Bey; on the part of Russia, General Tsherikoff, formerly a member of the Turco-Persian frontier commission, and Colonel Ivanin, of the Etit-Major; France sent Colonel Pelissier, of the Etdt-Major; and England Colonel Simmons, R.E., C.B., attached during the -war as British Commissioner to OmarPasha's army. Originally the Commission was to have finished its work eight months after the ratification; the delay in the evacuation of Kars and several other causes concurred to make the execution of it impossible in that space of time. A line of country 350 miles in length was to be examined, and the preliminary arrangements were not completed till the month of September last year, when it would have boen too late to undertake the work. By a common agreement, therefore, the period assigned by the treaty for the work of the Commission was extended, and the beginning of it deferred to the month of May of this year. At the beginning of that month the English, French, and Turkish Commissioners, with their staff, started for Erzeroum, and thence to Gumri or Alexandrapol, the Russian fortress on the ArpaChai, which formed the basis of operation of the Russian army besieging Kars. There they were met by the Russian Commissioners. The Commissoners of Turkey and Russia had each their escortsthe Turks of regular cavalry, and the Russians of Cossacks. The first thing to be done was to go over the line of frontier, especialy over that part about which there are disputes between Turkey and Russia ; and certainly the Commission deserves considerable credit for the expeditious way in which this business was gone through. The 350 miles of frontier, most of which runs along the highest ridges, was inspected in two months, and the rest of the work in three more, so that not more than five months have elapsed between the departure of the Commission from Constantinople and its return thither. This was mainly due to the good understanding which existed all through between the members of the Commission, and, it is but fair to say, to the readiness which the Russians showed to facilitate tho work with all the means in their power. They not only supplied the Commisdion with their excellent topogoraphical surveys, but evinced likewise a laudsble spirit of conciliation in the settlement of the disputed points. Withoutthe accurateRussian surveys which were at the command of the Commission the work could not have been completed in one summer, for the Turks, although so much interested in their frontier towards Russia, possess nothing of the kind. The want of this became fatal during the last war, and I can tell it you as the opinion of a competent judge that had there been a knowledge of that country like that which can be acquired by the Russian maps Kars might have been relieved. As it was, all the plans for a campaign had to be made from inaccurate maps, and on a scale altogether insufficient for military operations, and the English Government, when it considered the possibiity of a campaign in those parts, had to send Major Cathcart to find out whether there was any possibility of advancing with an army from Batoum to Erzeroum. The Commission first visited the southern part of the frontier, towards Mount Ararat. The summit of little Mount Ararat forms here the limit between the three empires of Russia, Turkey, and Persia. The line, passing then over the Great Ararat, follows the highest ridge of the chain, with ecan,ely any variation, up to the junction of the Araxes with the Arp-Chai, which coming down dne eouth forms the frontier between the two empires, until it toucbes near its source the spur which unites the mountains of Asia Minor with the Caucasus. Of course, wherever the river forms the frontier line there is no dispute, but there are some differences lower down in the Ararat chain. In several places there are fine grassy plateaux and lakes on the top of the chain, sometimes at an elevation of 8,000 or 9,000 feet above the sea. Theseplateaux areused by the Kurds for pasturage during the few summer months, when they are alone accessible, and both sides claimed in the beginning more than their sbare; the line which the French and English Commissioners have taken in common was that of mediation, and the Russians accepted the compromise proposedby them, but the Turks did not. The reason which they gave for insisting on their claims is that it would dissatisfy the Kurds living on their territory, who have a kind of prescriptive right to these highlands. The Kurdish tribes on the frontiers are nothing more or less than what the Greeks are on the frontier between Turkey and Greece-a set of robbers, who, properly speaking, belong neither to one nor to the other country, and who remain in one only to collect as much plunder as they can, and then pass to the other to live on it quietly whlle it lasts. There are, indeed, Cossack posts on the Russian side which are supposed to prevent them, but they do it just as little as the frontier guards of Greece and the Arnouts of Turkey have done it until lately on the Turco-Greek frontier, especially I as it Is in the Rusian interest to be on good terms with the Kurds of Turkey. It is not by a few miles of pasturage that they will become ttached to the Sultan;lt is onlyby a change in the system which has been adopted towards them. In the mountains of Asia s inor in eneral, but especially in the frontier part inhabited by the Kurds, the old clan system had kept itself i up much longer than anywhere else. The tribes acknowledged the sovereignty of the Sultan, and even paid taxes and gave their voluntary contingent during the wars, but they were governed by their owrn hereditary chieftains, who received only pro formd the confirmation of the Sultan. They were, it is true, now and then troublesome, and had their own little private feuds, but through them the Pashas of Erzeroum and the Government at Constantinople had still some kind of control over these wild tribes, and it would have only re. quired a small but well-disciplined army, which was under all circumstances necessary on the frontier, to keep them in awe. Uxnfortunately, the disturbances which took place some years ago were taken advantage of to indulge in the centralizing mania which has seized the Turkish politicians, and this clan system was upset b force; the heredita Boys and Pashas were replaced by Moodir andlaimakans sent from Stamnboul, who have just power enough to annoy and plunder the peaceful part of the population, but none to coerce the turbulent nomades, who, deprivedof their natural chieftains, are now scattered about in confusion. The effects of the system were not slow In appearing. The basin of Bayazid, once studded with villages, aud converted by irrigation into one large garden, Is now a parched desert covered with ruins. The town itself, the great centre for the transit trade into Persia, which not 30 years ago numbered 60,Q00 inhabitants has now not more than 2,000, among whom the kaimakan lives in the palace of the former hereditary Pasha. The scene of desolation which the Commiwsion found in the district of Bayazid followed them all along the Turkish side of the frontier, especially in the plain to the east and north-east of Kars, through which the Arpa-Chai eats its way-everywhere ruiined vllages and traces of former cultivation, misery, and a diminishing, desponding population. NTo doubt a great deal is OWinlg to the former and the late wars, and to the Armenian emigration in 1828, but not a little likewise to the carelessness of the Turks. This plaln was formerly chiefly inhabitedby Armenians whose ancient capital, Ani with its magnificent ruins, still shows the prosperity and amount of civilization which once must have existed in this home of the Armenian race. In order to guard the frontier provincel against Persia, which then possessed Erivan, large Musuulnian colonies were introduced, who, as in every other case of military colonization, which was formerly a state's maxim proved always stanch warriors, but, at the same time, hard masters. The result was that which attends the introduction of the redlegged partridges among black-legged partridges. The latter took to emigration, which, especiaUy after the destruction of Ani by earthquake, increasei rapidly. The Russians were not slow in taking advantage of this, and, above all, when the possession of the Persian province of Erivan gave the seat of the Armenian patrlarch into their power, they did their best to encourage it, and thus to get a hold on the Armenian race. It was likewise with this view that they were content to keep only rart, so closely connected with the traditions of the Armenian race. When most of the Armenians left the right bank of the Arpa-Chai one might have expected that the remaining Mussulman population would have been at least cared for. But this was not the case. They held stanchly to the Turks during the late war, sent some of the best defenders into Kars, and suffered the whole weight of the war. Now their services are forgotten, and they have sunk into a listless state of apathy. To the north of the plain of the Arpa-Chai the frontier follows again a succession of mountain chains running from south-east to north-west, which rise in some places to a height of 10,000 feet. But thecharacter of these mountains is entirelydifferent; the whole country about the Ararat and to the south of Akhaltzik is of a volcanic nature ; barren conical mountains, a number of lakes close to the top, an accumulation of lava in the plains; from Akhaltzik, on thei contrary, through Gouriel down to the sea, beautiful woods, a refreshing climate, and a luxuriant vegetation. The province of Akhaltzik, which has been ceded to Russia by the Treaty of Adrianople, has kept most of the Turkish inhabitants, who, although oppressed by taxation, are on account of the security which they enjoy not inimical to their masters. Gouriel is the last province towards the sea which forms the frontier between the Turks and Russians. It is inhabited by a branch of the Mingrelian race. Those who inhabit the Turkish territory have become Mussulmans, andl a continual feud reigns between the two,which is the reason why this part of the frontier will probably cause greater difficulties than anyother. But, on the whole, the differences rLre trifling; they involve no interests either commercial or military, so that no difficulty need be apprehended. The commission has received orders to resume its sittings here, which will begin as soon as the Russian commissioner arrives. During their tour over the frontier the commissioners received an invitation from Prince Baryatinski, the Governor-General of the Caucasus, to visit Tefiis, and they were received with the utmost hosIpitality. There is every hope that the remaining compromise will soon be effected, but it in not sufficient to regulate the frontier. Something ought to be done for its future defence. The Russians have a large fortress, Alexandrapol, close to the frontier, which served them as a base of operations during the late war. All along the Tu-kish frontier there is nothing, and yet the facilties afforded by the mountainous nature of the country is such that the frontier-line might be easily defended; there was, indeed, a commision named for this purpose last year, but it never even went to the spot. Nay, there is not even a road from the sea into the interior; the road from Trebizond to Erzeroura is in such a state that even in summer, when the commissioners passed, they had to dismount in some places. And on this road the whole trade passes to Persia. There was a grant made some years ago of 80,0001. for sucharoad, butthereneverwas 2,000l.'s-worth,of road xmade, which does not prevent the man intrusted with thiswork from holding a high financial position in the Government. Unless sometbing be done the Russians will succeed in attracting the Persian transit trade. They are already talking of making the Rion navigable, and to connect this river by a railway with the Kur, and thus with the Caspian Sea. As there are more than 2 000,0001. sterling worth of English goods going yeaily to Persia by the Black Sea the subject is not without interest for us. You will know that Herat has been given over by the Persians, and according to all accounts there is every reason to he satisfied with the manner in which the latter have fulfilled the terms of the treaty. TME NAVIGATION OF THE DANUBE. (FROMI OUP VI-NA CORRESPONDI)NT.) The question of the free navigation of the Danube must soon be publicly discussed, The following wilL enable your readers to form a correct opinion of its merits. The " Riverain Commission" (a commission formed by the representatives of the States lying on the baks of the river Danube) has obstinately refused to give any account of its proceedings to the European Govenmnents, and they are consequently strongly inclined to suspect that it has taken resolutions which are not likely to meet with the approval of the Paris Conference. Their auspicious are probably correct, for an Austrian correspondent thus writes to the Frankfort Post Zeitung on the subject:- "According to the treaty of peace the Danube is, like the Rhine, Weser, and Elbe, to be free. If we ask whether any vessels esides those belonging to the Riverain States have a right to go up the Rhine, Weser, and Elbe, the answer must be in the negative. Those rivers are free f r the Riverain States from the point at which they are firs, navigable down to their mouths. In that part of the Vienna Congress Act which refers to the navigation of rivers flowing through the territory of different potentatei It is only the question of the Biverain States, and It is nowhere said that vessels belonging to foreign countries are at liberty to enter such rivers from the sea and to navigate them. If there is a port at the embouchure of such rivers the vessels of all nations can enter it, but from the navigation of the rivers themselves they are excluded." Now, the assertions contained in the foregoing article are totally erroneous, as you will see by the following extracts from the Congress Act of Vienna, which everybody speaks of, but hardly any one takes the trouble to read:- " Article 108. The Powers whose States are aeparated or traversed by a navigable river pledge themselves to regulate by oommon accord everything relating to the management of such river. " 109. The naviption of such rivers as those indicated in the preooding article shall be entirely free from the point at which they become navigable down to their embouchure, and no one can be prevented trading in them (el nepour-ra, sous le rapport du commerce, 6tre interdite d personne). It is well understood, however, that people must act conformably to the police regulLtions relative to the navigation, which shall be the same for all, And as favourable as possible to the commeroe of all nations. " 110. The system established-as well for oolecting the duties as for the maintenanos of the police-shall, in a far as is possible, be the same throughout the river, and shall extend, unless particular circumstances should iprevent, to al the branch or conflnent rivers which In their navigable course separate or traverse different States. "11 L The tax on the naLvigation shall be fixed in a uni form and invariable manner, and sgfficiently independent of the diferent quality of the goods, so that a detailed examination of the cargo shall not be necessary, exoepting in case of fraud or contravention. The amount of sach tax which cannot under any circumstnces exceed thzt actually existing, must depend on local circunastances, and consequently it is impossible to establish any general rule on the subject. However, in drawing up the tarin the point of view must be the encouragement of commerce and the facilitation of the navigtion. The toll taken on the Rhine may serve as an approximative basis. The tariff once settled, it cannot be augmented vrithout a common arrange. ment between the Riverain Sttes. The navigation c ano' be burdened by any taxes excepting those estblished by the regulations. " 112 is of no interest for the foreign publio. " 113. Each Riverain State shall keep in order the tow. rads vrhich pass through its territories, and also the bed of the river, so that there may be no impediment to the navigation. Ftue regulations wll settile the manner in whih the Riverain States are to contribute towards the cleansing of the river wvhen its two banks belong to different Governments.

NOT EXACTLY A LOVE-ciSE.-We met yesterday at the Miami Depot a lady who has exhibited the most indefatigable perseverance in the pursuit of information under embarrassing difficulties. Three years ago she resided in California, which State, in fact, she claims now as her residence, and there became acquainted with a mnan named Munson-a p leasing, cool, affable gentleman, who so adroitly worked his way into her confidence that she introduced him to a young lady, a near and dear friend. possessed of some $15,000 or $20,UO0 in cash. The result, as might have been anticipated, was the consuammation of the lady's heartfelt wishes-the mariage of her friend to the polished and affable gentleman. A few months rolled round and everything passed off smoothly enough. The husband was affectionate and attentive, the lady all love and confidence, Finally, the husband expressing a wish to enter into busi. nesa and settle down for life, the confiding wife drew from her bankers almost the entire of her fortune and placed it in his hands. A week after the steamer sailed for the Atlantic side, and the villain hnsband departed with the gold, leaving his confiding victim to the tender mercies of a local world that is far too busy to look after individual wrongs in which they have no personal or pecuniary interest. The lady who had brought about the match felt an,d boldly faced her responsibility in the premises, and on the sailing of the next homeward-bound steamer she took passage for New York, determined to follow the betrayer of her confidence and the love of a wife to the bounds of civilization, and bring him to punishment. Arrived in Neow York, she got traces of his footsteps, followed him over various routes, until she tracked him to a village in Pennsylvania, where she found him with another wife, to whom he had been married before going to California! A warrant was issued for his arrest for bigamy, but, having no proofs of his second marriage, after a short examination he was discharged. Nothing daunted by this unlooked-for termination of affairs, the lady immediately returned to California, procured the necessary affidavits substantiating Munson's marriage there, together with evidence of the fact of his having absconded with some $15,000 of his second wife's funds, and once more returned to the Atlantic side In search of the betrayer of her friend. And that search she has prosecuted now for two or three months with the most determined and restless perseverance but thus far without success, He had left the vill where heresided when arrested for bigamy, and, although the lady had obtained some subsequent traces of his movements, -when we met her yesterday she had not yet succeeded in ascertaining his present residence, although she is satisfied it is somewhere in the West. She had already expended a large amount of her own funds in the pursuit, and expressed the determination nottogie up the chase until her " sweet revenger" had been gratified, and the villain brought to justice. mly her labours prove sucoasul will be the Wish of every honest heart. The lady pursuer left yesterday for Cleveland, where she has friends residin. If she may not be classed among the " strong-minded women," she is oertainly a very deterruined one.-Cinc nat Gazette. THx E iR=QvA.XE ouT WEST.-Our citizens wera startled yesterday morning from those deep slumbers which ever precede approchin dca by an arthquake such as has seldom, If ever before, visited the United States. We are as yet unadvised of the extent of soil over which it has exercisad its rge, and of the intensity of its violence in other loealities. Riumours prevailed in the streets yesterday of disasters occasioned by it to various cities along the lower Mississippi, which were of course discredited, as the telegraph, up to 3 late hour, gave us no information of ary such misfortune. These reports probably grew entrely out of those & prior! reLsonings which are so apt to mislead and dope the mass of men, even whenl they pnde themselves on a strict adberence to the laws of evidence and experience. Over the adjoining regions of Illlnois and those portions of the State lying contiguous to St. Louis it is certain that the commotion was not less severe than it was in this aity. In Illinois it was accompanied by a tempestuous sky and electrical phenomena of an unusual character; while with us it was preceded bv freaks of electricity, variously described as vivid fishes of lightning, and as the descent of a blinding meteoric ball from the heavens. The interval between the two shocks, the finrst of which occurred at about a puarter-past 4 o'clock,was one of a painful suspense to such as had aroused themselves to a full consciousness of the nature of the danger, and who adverted to the fact that ordinarily at least in the earthquakes of the tropics the violence of the convulsions succeeoing the first of vabich there are commonly two, was that of a progress nearly equalling geometrical ratio. The stanchest houses swayed to and fro with an undulatory motion very much resembling that of a ship labourig under an angry sea, now seeming to step still and bid defiance to the towering waves, and anon bounding forward quivering in every plank, and imparting to the voyager that ineffable senstiion which is to the mind what sea sickness is to the body. The rattliiw of windows, the displacement of furniture, the gle ming o! lights from bedrooms which suddenly illummated the pitch darkness which prevailed; the wild terror of some and the bewilderment of others whom the threatening pheomenon bad startled from their dreams, formed a scene more easUy imagined than described. The second shock took place about five minutes fter the first, but was of brief dunation and inferior violence.-S Louis Dcmocras, Oct. 9.
TRE WA TERLOO-BRTDGE MURDER ADJOURNED LN' E"-ST resterday at 3 o'clock the inquest-opened on dMonday fortnight on the remains of the body of an individual, name unkaown, which were found on an abtument of Waterloo bridge on the morning of Friday, the 9th iust.-was resumed before Mr. Bedford, the coroner for the city of Westminster, and a jury in the board-roomi of tbe Strand t-tiion, Bow-street. There was a considerable number of persons present at the investigation, but nothing like the crowd which assembled on the former occasion. Samuel Ball was called by Mr. Superintendent DurkinHe said,-I ive at 10, Grove-place, Waterloo-road, and am "a general dealer." On Thursday, October S, between il ana 12 at nigb.t, I was going along Waterloo-bridge from the Strand side. I had paid my money at the toU.gate, and bade Errington, the collector at the gate, " Good night." When I got as far as the first recess of the bridge I pulled out my pipe and said to myself, " I'll go back to the gate and beg a light." I went back for that purpose, a nd as I was going to ask for a light I saw a short "party"-dressed in female attire, and about 5 feet :3 inches in height, passing through the turnstile. I heard Errington say to her, "If you can't lilft the bag through yourself, why can't you ask somebody else?l" I then saw Errington lift the bag over. It was a carpet-bag, but I did not notice the colour of it, or whether it hasd leather sides. The person in question also carried a parceL When Errlngton lifted the bag over sbe took it fron him, and as she did so I caught sight of her full faceShe had a sallow complexion and rather sunken eyes, with a mark on the left cheek, near the nose, which I took to be a mole. The hair was a kind of a white, but it did not look a natural colour. I saw her features quite distinctly, but did not take any notice of her dress. She proceeded along the bridge about half a yard, and thea I overtook and passed her. After I had passed her I saw a rather tallish man on the opposite side of the bridge, and near the Surrey end of it, walking easly towards the Strand. Efe was about the first recess on the Surrey side. I did not take any particular notice of him, and could not identify him. That is all I know. Mr. R. B. Painter, of 3, Brldge-street, the divisional surgeon to the F division of police, next presented himself at the table. He said in his last evidence before the Court he gave a short outline of the main features of the case under Investigation, but there wvere one or two points which he ouiitted to notice, and which he should like now to supply. Oa the day after the last sitting of the inquisition he made a further examination of the remains of the deceased, the chief result of which was that, in addition to confirming his previous opinions, he discovered a fact which set the question of the deceased's sex at rest; for on the rainus of the right ischium he found a smal portion of the corpus cavernosum. He also stated on the first occasion of his giving evidence that, feeling the importance of preserving the remains of the deceased in an unaltered condition, he placed the 23 portions in an antiseptic solution; but before doing that he separated a portion of muscle with some of the saline particles he before spoke of, and, plaoing them in a bottle, retained them carefully in his own immediate possession. That bottle with ite contents he had since handed to Dr. Taylor for analysis, with whom he had been associated in examining the remains subsequent to the last inquisition. Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor was next called. Ie said,-I am a Felow of the CoUege of Physicians and a Fellow of the Royal Sooiety, I have made an examination of the remains of the body shown me by Mr. Painter, under an order of the Secretary of State. I have made an analysis of the whole case, and drawn it up in the form of a report. It is as follows:- " I made an examination of these remains on three separate occasions-viz., on the 18th, 19th, and 21st of October. They were shlown to me on each ocoasion by the divisional surgeon, Mr. Painter, in the presence of Inspector Durkin. These remains are parts of a human body, and, making some allowance for the missing portions, they admit of an acculrate adjustment to each other. 23 pieces of the body were shown to me, consisting chiefly of bones with the fiesh adhering to them. The flesh had been roughly cut from the bones, apparently with the view of removing as much of it as possible, and the parts had been cut and sawn into smal ler,gths, probably to reduce their bulk, and to allow them to be packed within a small space. The trunk, including part of the chest and spine, has been cut into eight pieces; the upper lnmbs have been cut or sawn into six, and the lower limbs into nine pieces. The deficient portions are the head, with the greater part of the spine-namely, 14 out of 24 vertebr-e (7 cervical and 7 upper dorsal), the hands, the feet, and some portions of the left side of the chest. The whole of the viscera of the chest and abdomen are also deficient. When compared with the average weight of the body the quantity found is small. The 23 pieces produced, after e=akng in brine for some days, weighed only 181b. This is about oneoeighthi of the average weight of the adult bodv. These remains have beeu examined especially with a view to the solution of the following questions:- * 1. The sex, age, and stature of the deceased. " 2. The presence of any physiological or pathological pecuharities in reference to identity. 3. The presence of any marks of violence with reference to the probable cause of death. "4. The general condition of the remains, with a view to determine whether they are parts of a dissected body, and whether they had undergone any chymical process for the purpose of preservation. *' .5. The length of the period whlch has elapsed since the death of the deceased. " I. SEX A'ND STATURE OF DE (EA.iED. It is unnecessary to deal vith a question somedmes raised on these occasions, whether the remains or any of them are those of an animal. Beyond all doubt they are parts of a human body, and there are no duplicate portions, suchas are commnonly found when bodies have been used for the lawful purposes of dissection. The parts found belong to one and the same body. The sex is also placed beyond all doubt. The length and massiveness of the bones of the upper and lower limbs, the nmarked charac ters of the ridges and processes, the form of the pelvis, the dimensions of the part called the inlet, the narrowness of the space in the arch of the pubis, clearly indicate that the deceased was of the male sex. This is confirmed by the re. mains of a portion of the anatomical structure of the male still adhering to the arch of the pubis on the right 6ide. An attempt has obviously been made to destroy all traces of the sex, and this, so far as the soft parts are concerned, has been effected on one side of the arch of the pubis, but not on the other. These sexual partahavenot been dissected, but rudely mutilated, and irregularly cut on the two sides after death. The firmess, solidity, size, and weight of the bones, the complete ossification of the ends of the long bones, and the thicuessof the shafts of the thigh bones, compared with the space occupied by the medullary cavities, are in a condltion which show that the deceased had reached a full adult age, which I would assign presumptively, judging from the appearasce of the skeleton, at fromt 30 to 40 years. "IL PYSIOLnoGICAL OR PAT55OLOCI(CAL PECULIARITIEs. ' The bones presented in no part marks of malformation, disease, united fractures, or meohanical injury, excepting that which had been produced after death by saWing. Some of the joints were fixed with the sawn portions of the bones in an unusual direction. The was oflexe orih thigh bone remaining on the hip joint was flexed or bent ontetukart anangle of 45 deg. ; the knee was also firmly flexed on this side at an angle with the thigb. The left arm nwas fixed in such a direction as to be widely separated from the left side of the body, instead of lying parallel to it, and on this side the fore-arm was firmly bent on the arm at the elbow joint, at an angle of 45 deg. On the right side, viewing the direction of the bones, as fixed by the portions left in the joints, the fore-arm wras bent on the upper arm at an angle of 80deg. On examining the joints it was found there was no ossification or other disease to account for this firmly fixed condition of the upper or lower limbs on the right side, and the upper lmb on the left side. So I infer from this examination that the limbs had not been relaxed since they had undergone the rigidity of deatb, that the body had been cut and sawn wbile IU this rigid state, and that the mode iu which it was subsequently treated, to which I shall presently refer, tended to preserve the fixed condition of the joints as a result of cadaveric rigidity ina constrained pos. ture. The small portions of skin remaining on the wrist and on the right knee are rather thickly covered with long dark hair. III. ILVRKS OF VIOLESQN.-THE CAUSE OF DEATH. The cutting and sawing of these remains took place after death. The cutting bas been effected roughly with a knife, while the sawing has been perfornmed in the shafts of the long bones with a fine saw. In one portion of the left side of the chest, com;rising the second, third, and fourth ribs, ith one half of the chest bone attached, there Is an aperture in the flesh presenting the appearance of a stab, It lhi edtufront,b twleen the thir and fourth ribs, near .~sw. sue hest one, t haspene ,,_n,^ junctio with t xn cheat bone. It has peno-. trnted the cavity of the -chest, and ereeente, as seen from the inside, an openingf of about -0h o nic in its longest xIs, wbhich is obliule s ploaced, by icut inclined to a vertical direction. Asuing tlato ths waoud had been inficted during life, it would havi petated outhed th050ldlnginlthflitoh°d vou hdasi pcednetrdOatedth heart, and have produced rapid, if not immediate death. The muscles of the chest through which this stab had passed were for some apace around of a dark red colour, evidently produced by blood which had been effused as a result of this wound. This appeearne iz ualike acthat oduced by a aut or stab in a cold dead body in which circulation has ceased. The edges of the wound are everted, and this fact, to ether with the infiltration of the muscles with blood, whicg even the soakng in liquid for h week had not removed, lead me to the conclusion that this wound was intlicted on the deceased either durin lif r within a few mninutes of death-i.e, while the bo was warm and the blood wa liquid, There Is no other mark of violence during life, or any other appearance in the remains which points to a cause of death. The deceased may bave actually died from a franc ture to the skul and injTury to the brain, or from a stab in the rbdomen affecting some large blood vesseL As the organs of the chest and abdomen are not forth. coming, any opinion on the cause of death must be a matter of speculation. The ribs and muscles of the -right side of the chest (whicoh are complete ia three pieces), wheni placed together and examined preent no marks of stabbing or fracture; any miortal wound on the chest, therefore, must have been on the left side, The first, filth, and sixth ribs, with their attached muscles, are wanti on this side. There may have been stabs in the spaoe between these missing ribs which would have In~vol7ved the large blood vessels of the chest or thze heart itself. ",4.-cmqxREitL CO"imoiTO 9F THE REMAINS. "The portioni of the 23 pieces of the bMy presented no sapearance of having undergone dissection for the purposes of anatomy. The mauscles, bloodvessels (whioh were not Injected), and the nerves had been cnt through In aU directions without any reference to relatlve positions. or the re*pactive courses of the vessels and nerves. The spinal marrow had been violently torn out of the vertebral canal, and left hanging by its sheath to the veterbrre. The joints had been sawn through, evidently with great trouble, at points where a sealpel in the hands of even a young anatomist would have speedily effected a separation of the limbs. The acromeon process of the right scapula or bladebone had been sawn through in order to remove the shoulder. The right olavicle was left attaohed to the upper rib on that side; the sternuLm, or chest bone, was sawn in a right line through its centre, while the cartilages of the remaining ribs, which are always cut forthe convenient examination of the chest, were uncat. The left scapula or bladebone had been roughly sawn through, so as to leave the cavity of the shoulder joint, with the neck of the bladebone stil attached, to the head of the humerus, or long bone of the arm; and the ribs and processes of the vertebrie of the spine were sawn and out without reference to their anatomical bearings. The pelvis was sawn into two pteces through the centre of the sacrum. In short, the clearest examination, coupled with the knowledge derived from an experience of Eeven years spent in the study of anatomy by disseotions, leads use to the conclusion that these remalns have not been employed foranyanatomical purpose whatever. On the contrary, Ibelteve that, from the period at which the rigidity of death took place they have been rendered utterly useless for any such purpose. Tho'delsh left upon the bones was brittle and of a brownish colour. ^A portion of this, as zemoved from the bones soon after their discovery, was delivered to sou by Mr. Painter, and I made a chymical examination of it in his presence. It had not undergone putrefaction, and had the smell of salted muscle. It was submitted to analysis for the detection of those substances which are used for the preservation of animal matter-namely, arsenic, corrosive sublimate, common salt, nitre, alumina, and chloride of zinc, with the result that ths only substance present was common salt. This was separnted from the muscular fibre, and obtained in a crystalline state. The thicker portion of the flesh remaining on the bones of the pelvis,! when cut into, was of a slightly reddish tint. This red tint was probably partly owing to the effects of salting. The superficial portion of flesh In the remains presented a brownish colour, and softened and corrugated appearanre, produced by exposure to boiling water, The ligaments, tendons, the exposed portions of cartiage of the joints, and the skin on the wrists and right knee presented such appearances as exposure to boiling water for a short period would alone account for or explain. The cutiole of the skin which was not in a state of putrefaction could be peeled off. The bare skin itself was [swollen, gelatinous. looking and curved inwards at the margin where the feet had been removed from the cellular membrane beneath. Such would be the effect produced by boiling water. An examination of the swollen shafts of the long bones clearly shows that the marrow has been melted out and removed by boiling water from the medullary cavities at each exposed extremity. The boiling has not been continued for a length of time, since the deep-seated portions of the museles do not show the changes which would have otherwise been produced in them, and the marrow is not removed from the centre of the long bones. The divided ends of the arteries, and the divided portion of the spinal marrow with Its sheath, also show such effects as boiling water would produce. The cut portions of the arteries are opaque, hardened, and averted. " To this exposure to tho action of boiling water, while the separate portions of the body were in a state of eadaverie rigidity, I attribute the peculiar fixation of the thigh, knee, and arms in a flexed or bent condition. The ligaments appear to have contracted as a result of the action of hot water, and thereby to have retained the same portions of bone, remaining on the joints in the position which they had acquired as the result of rigidity. The appearances are such as are produced by boiling water on dead animal matter. There is nothing to show that boiling wate- has acted on any living structure, while it is obvious, from the effects produced on the sawn bones, ligaments, and arteries, that the body must have been out up before the parts were exposed to boiling temperature. It Is my opinion that the remains were exposed to boiling water before they were salted. In reference to the portion of flesh whioh I examined, the 8alt was in suoh quan. tity that it was easily dissolved from the outside by cold distilled water; anad I am confirmed by Mr. Painter that when first examined by him parts of flesh presented solid gritty particles like salt. These facts lead to the inference that the salting took place after the partial boiling of the remains; the objectof these two operations being probably the same-namely, to prevent putrefaction, and the probable discovery of the remains by the escape of putrescent efflnvia. The piece of flesh which I examined, as taken from the remains by 3ir. Painter, had no offensive smell whatever, although he had kept it for a period of eight "5.--PERIOT SINCX DEATL. "On this point only a speculative opinion can be given. As the remams have been partly boiled and salted, those changes in the animal matter on which we are accustomed to rely for evidence of the period of death have been susuended. Still, an examination of the deep-seated narts of the flesh and of the right hip joint, which had not 'been opened or disturbed until the 2lst inst., has led me to the conclusion that the person of whose body these remains were a part may bave been dead three or four weeks prior to that date. This would carry the probable time of death to the last week in September or to the first week in October, The period may have been shorter than this-that is, that death may have taken place more recently; but, considering that the weather during that time was mild, humid, and favourable to putrefaction, Ido notthink- that it was longer. Had death occurred at a more remote period, I should have expected to find some visible changes indicative of putrefaction in the interior of the right hip joint and on the deep. seated portions of flesh on the bones around the joint. CONCLUSIONS. "The conclusions which I draw from this examination "L That the remains are those of a person of the male sex, of adult age, and in stature of at least five feet nine inches. " 2. That they p resent no physiological or pathological peculiarities by which they can be identified. The only fact observable under this head is that the portions of skin remaining are thickly covered with dark hairs on the wrkt and right knee, and that the deceased was therefore pro. bably a dark hairy man. " 3. That the remains present no mark of disease or of violent injury inflicted during life, with the exception of one stab in the space between the third and fourth ribs on the left side of the che$s This stab was in a situation to penetrate the heart and to cause death. It presents the characters of a stab injflcted on a person either living or recently dead. " 4. That these remains have not been dissected or used for the purposes of anatomy. All those parts which are useful to the anatomist have been roughlysevered and destroyed by a person or persons quite ignorant of the anatomical relations of parts. They have been cut and sawn before the rigidity ox death had ceased, i. e. in from 18 to 24 hours after desath, and in this state have been partally boiled and subsequently salted. The body of the deceased has not been laid out or attended like that of a person dying from natural causes whose body might be lawfully used for anatomical purposes. " 6. That the person of whose body these remains are a part may have been dead for a period of three or four weeks prior to the date at vvhich they were examined by menamely, on the 21st of October. "iZPOlrT ON CERTAIN ARTICLES OF CLOTHING FOUND WITH THE REMAINS. "On Monday, October 19, and on Wednesday, October 21, varnious articles of clothing, stated to have been found in a carpetbag with the remains, were shown to me by Superlntendent nurldn, at the Bow-street police-station in the presence of Mr. Painter. " Overcoat.-The lining of the left sleeve in the armpit is much stained with blood. It appears to have eollected there. The right sleeve is cut or torn up in its length. On the collar behind and towards the left side there is a Cut or stab, as from a double-edged knife. " Under-coat (frock-coat).-This is completely cut up the back from behind, and in the hollow corresponding to the left armpit there is a deep stain of blood. On the left side of the collar behind is a stab or cut, as from a double-edged knife, apparently corresponding to the cut on the collar of the overcoat. " Waistcoat.-This is torn up the back. There are stains on the left side from blood (inside), apparently diffused by wetting, On the top of the collar behind there is a cut or stab as from a double-edged knife, corresponding in form and direction to the cuts In the collars of the over and under coats. In the waistcoat this cut was found to be in its long axis five-eighths of an inch in length. " Trouscrat-These are torn up at the back. There is no appearance of blood inside or outside. There are some stains of dirt and other matters. " Shirt.-The right sleeve is torn up. On the left side in front there are eight cuts or stabs corresponding in number and apparently in situation to cuts or stabs in the under shirt. There was no appearance of blood about these outs, either inside or outside, but the front of the shirt, at the upper part, presented a generally diffused redness, such as w be produced by blood diluted with water. -- under siirt (merino).-Thisis torn in its length at the de and behind. On the left side, and in front, there were eight cuts, or stabs, near to each other, leaving the long axis upwards and A little slanting. The largest of these was three-quarters of an inch in its long axis, and the smallest one a quarter of an inch. There were no marks of blood abouat these cuts either indde or outside ; but the shirt was much stained with blood just above them, both inside and outside, In a direction towards the left shoulder. The blood appeared diffused as if by wetting, except under one of the buttons where it had coagulated, as it does when it issues from the body of a living person. There was also much blood (diffused) on the wrist of the left sleeve. "The Drawers.-These were cut up the back. There was a diffused stain of blood on the right side. In the waist, i in front, there was a puncture or stab, about three-eiehtbs of an inch in Its greatest length, such as would be produced by a sword cane. This apparently corresponded to apertures in the trousers and on ihe shirt. " The Socks.-One of these presented on the inside diffused marks of blood. On one there was a distinct spot of blood near the toes. "Half of a black satin necktie.-Tkere was a slight keddish staiu on the lining. "CONCLUSION. The examination of these articles of clothing leads me to the conclusion that the body of the person who wore them must have been subjected to great violence. The stab penetrating from behind the double collar of the overcoat must have been inEficted with great force, as it extends through the collar of the undercoat and waistcoat. It is chiefly on the insBde and on the left side, towards the left armpit, that the principal stains of blood are meb with in the overcoat, undercoat, and waistcoat. The only wound found in the remains is a stab on the left side, whioh, by its situation, might have led to the effusionx of blood. Assuming that the clothes belonged to the fdeceased,these facts appear to receive an expilanation. The clothes have, howev'er, beenex posed to wet snethey were stained with bleed, and this creates a difficulty inftorming an opinon. The cutting and taig of the coat, trousers, and drawers at the back, and the utting and tearing of the right sleeves of the overcoat, undercoat, and shirt are consistent with the assumption that the body had become rigid after death in a distorted position, and that the clothes were violently torn from it. This position is indicated in the remains, especially on the right side by the flexed or bent condition of the hip and elbow joints. Some of the stains of blood present the ap. pearance of having flowed from a living person, and this renders it therefore probable that the clothes were on a living body when the wounds producing such effusion of blood were inflicted. While there is nothing to prove directly that these clothes were worn by the deceased, they have, in imy opinion, been worn by some one who has sustained serious personal injuries. Their condition, however, is con. sistent with the supposition that they were actually worn by the deceased individual with whose remains they were found. "ALFRED S. TAYLOR, X.D., F.R.S. "15, St. James's-terrace, Regent's Park, Oct. 23." At the conclusion of his report Dr. Taylor stated to the coroner and jury his readiness to answer any question they might wiab to put to hibr on the sbject under investigation. The Coroner said Dr. Taylor had so completely anticipated every question that could arise in the very lucid do. cument he had justread to the Court that he did not think it necessary, and he apprehonded the jury would be of tha same opinion, to address any interrogatory to him. Superintendent Durkin, in reply to the Court, said at that time he had no further evidence to produce. The Coroner, addressing the jury, said they had not had the satisfaction of hearing any evidence touching this mysterious case that would involve any particular individual in connexion with it; but he thought they had quite sufficient to enable them to come to a decision upon it. In all inquisitions of thatkind the first object was to ascertain, if possible, how the deceased died. It very often happened that an inquiry in the Coroner's-court commenced without there being the slightest degree of suspicion against any Individual. It began with the mere faot of death, but the evidence that came out frequently connected indi vidualv with the death, and in that case it was the duty of the police authorities and the jury so to investigate the matter as to come to a satisfactory conclusion upon it If possible. They had not in this case any evidence of that kind before them, but with the light which the evidence that had been already adduced In court threw upon the subject matter of inquiry he thought they might now proceed to consider their verdict. Nothing had been wanting on the part of the police to endeavour to connect some individual with the case. He did not now ask whether the polioe had done so, or whether they had any chance of doing so; but he felt that it waslittle less than certain that their efforts would have that result in the end. They (the jury) would consider the finding of the body, sad the fact of the wounds discovered upon it, and ssy whether they were satisfied that the deceased had died from those wounds or from violence of any other kind. If they should be of that opinion they would further consider whether those wounds or thatviolence had been inflicted by some person maliciously-whether, in fact, the deceased had been murdered, and, if so, whether by some person or persons unknown. The clothes of the deceased would form a material part of the case hereafter, but he would not trouble the jury with them at present. If they came to a verdict the matter would stil remain in the hands of tho police. After briefly recapitulating the medical testimony touching the probable cause of death and the age and sex of the deceased, the coroner concluded by asldng the jury to say whether or not they thought the deceaed was a male person and of adult age, and what was the cause of his death. The jury retired for a brief interval, and on their return into court the foreman said they found that the remails under investigation were those of a male person of adult age who had been wilfully murdered by some person or persons unlmown. At the conclusion of the inquisition Dr. Taylor took occasion to say to the Court that in the analysis he had made of the deceased's remains he had received most valuable assistance froa Mr. Painter, the divisional surgeon, and that without such assistance he should not have been able to complete his examination within the requisite time. Mr. Painter asked, now that the jury had come to a decision, what was to be done with the remains of the deceased, which, he added, were at present at the Bowstreet police-station ia a preservative fluid? The Coroner said he thought they should be kept for the preeent in the custody of the police. He should give no order for their interment until it was asked for by Superintondent Durldn. Superintendent Durkin said they would be retained for the present lest by any chance other parts of the body might hereafter be found. With this the proceedings terminated.
THE EN1TZSH PUBLIC IN CALCUTTA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES, Sir,-In justice to thoe English publio of Calcutta I solicit the favour of a smnall space In your valusble columns for the following observations:- If there be any truth in the rumour " that the Calcutta Govermnent complains of the English public feeling in Calcutta as savage and vlndictive, as absorbed in a blind and undmlscminating exasperation, as resolving itself into a 'mere hatred of the dark kin, into a pure unreasoning autipathy to the Hindoo," then is that Government guilty of a gross and unjustifiable misrepresentation of the conduct of our fellow-countrymen in India. T'he English and European community of Calcutta is com. posed almost exclusively of well-educated gentlemen and most respectable tradesmen of the better class; this comn-u. -slty is ever busy, bustling, active, industrious, and hard. working. Their career of labour keeps them In constant intecourse with the natives of all classes. The offices of the merchaut, the lawyer, the banker, the engineer, as well as the establishments of the various shop. keepers, are filled with native assistants and clerks, who are -well remunerated and most kindly and considerately treated, In social life the natives mix much mnore with the English public than they Eo with the Government or offical gentlemen, and I will add that that public has a much better knowledge than the Governaent officils of the rnative character, -with its faults and its good qualities; and that, therefore, It knows well how to employ both the Hlndoo And the Mahomodan to advantage under proper guidance and survellance. Under these circumstances it Is obvious, beyond all doubt and dispute, that our country. men in the Indian Peninsula are wholly incapable of so dlgracing the national character of educated English gen. tlemen as by rumour the Calcutta Government represents them to have done. It is, however, worthy of remark, and also of serious con. sideration, that the English public of Calcutta appear to speak as with one voice in their donunclations against the Indian Government for incapacity and vacillation, and for a blind and infatuated rdherence to the traditionary polioy of the Eot Inldia Company. That policy may be described in a few words, as opposed to the introduction and spread of Christianity in India from purely selfish motives, and therefore as equally op. posed to and jealous of the independent and Christian Englishman settling in India, and venturing to scrutinize and even to condemn the proceedings and measures of the local Government in matters of the deepest interest to his life and property. The only motive that can be assigned either to the Cal., eutta Government or to its zealous but indiscreet advo" cates, who may be the authors of a rumour so prejudicial to our countrymen abroad, is the desire to deprive them of the sympathy and co-operation of the public and of the prmes in this country in the vigorous and determined efforts 'which they are about to make, by the formation of a league on the principle of the late Anti Corn Law League, to get rid of the present cumbersome and complex system of government in its triple form of Governor-General and Council, Court of Directors, and Board of ControL Tha abolition of this obstractive system, working in secret and without responsibility, together with the abolition of the East India Company and the extinction of an exclusive service, wil be the dawn of an auspicious and brig4t period not only for India and the Indians, but equally so for England and the English, Then only wil the conquerors and the conquered mutually benefit each other. But so long as India remains merely the land of officials, subservient to the policy of a chartered company, and almost unknown to the people of this country, there is indeed but faint hope that the light of Christianity will shine forth among its millions of inhabitants to lead them out from the hideous darkness of their idolatries and obscene worship, or that the blessings of education and clvilization will withdraw them from the gross sensualities and depravities of their social condition. But it is fruitlees to waste our energies in mere discussions. If, indeed, our rulers and the nation at large have truly humbled themselves before Heaven, and acknowledged the chastening hand of the Most High for the errors of the past in the government of India, what, I would ask, has been done by way of amendment to rectify or removo those errors? The nation may be considered as having sinned and erred by proy, and yet the trust remains with those who have been fully negligent of the first and most sacred duties of that trust, as wel as of the true Interests of this country and of IndX ofWhie, howeever, we are discussing the past and the future ofIndia, gentlemen belonging to the traditionary policy school are dealing with the present ANdIOPHILUS. ue. zO.

CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, Oct. 26. The above Court resumed its sittings to-day before the Right Hon. T. Q. Finnis, Lord Mayor; Russell Gurney, Esq., Q.O., Recorder; Alderman Sir R. W. Carden, Lord Mayor elect; Aldermen Hale and Gabriel * Mr. William Lawrence, alderman and sheriff; Mr. William Ferneley Allen, sheriff; Mr. James Josiah Millard and Mr. Thomas larker, undersheriffs, &c. It appears by the first edition of the calendar that there are 155 prisoners for trial at the present session, and the grand jury will, in all probability, not be discharged until the end of the week. The RECORDERc, after the grand jury had been sworn, proceeded to address them upon the subject of the cases that were likely to be brought before them. He said that as a somewhat longer period than usual had elapsed since the last session some additional business might have been expected at the present session, but he was afraid that this was not sufficient to account for the number of prisoners that was contained in the calendar, and he was sorry to say that the caes were not only very numerous, but that they were also of a very serious character. There were no less than five charges of wilful murder, and two other charpes that also involved the destraction of human life, which woeld come before them in the form of charges of manslaughter. The first cae of murder in the list was that of a woman named Bridget Kavanagh, who was accused of the murder of her chid by administering poison to it. it appeared that this prisoner was nursing the child, and that she had repeatedly complained of the burden it wasto her. and the child was subsequently found in a dying state from the effects of some narcotic poisoo. It appeared by the depositions that the prlsoner was seen to administer something to the child from a bottle, and this bottle was found afterwards to have contained laudanum, aLnd it would also be proved that thae prisoner had purchased some laudanum a short time before, making a false statement at the time as to the purpose for which she required it, and that sbe alsomadepartilcarinquiries as to the quantlty that mightbesafelyadnlttered,andthat she administereda muchlager qumatitythan thatwhichwasindicated to her. If those facts should be proved by the witnesses it appeared to him that itwouldbe the duty of the grand jury to return a true bilL The next case of mnurder was also against a womnan named Maria Clark, wpho was charged with killing her child ten years of age, by drowning it. There seemed to be no aoubt, as the evidence appeared in the depodtions, that the child was put into the water by the prisoner, but the question also would probably arise whether the prisoner was i such a state of mind at the time as to render her criminally responsible for her actions, That, bowe.-er, was a question which they were not entitled to enter into, and if the evidence satisfied them that the death of the child was oocasioned by the act of the prisoner it would be their duty to return a true bill against ber. The third charge of murder was one against a foreign seaman named De Rosazln, and It appeared that in the course of a scuffle and fight with one ef his comrades, who was also a foreigner, the prisoner stabbed the deceased with a knife. The only question for them to consider in this case was whether the prisoner was clearly made out to have used the knife, and if this fact was established to their satisfaction they ought to return a true biUl for wilful murder, and ay circumstances that existed that 'were calenlated to diminish the crime to manslaughter would be properly brought for the consideration of the petty jury. Tbe next m;e was one of a slngular character, a boy 10 years of age, named a ames Driscoll, being charged with destroying the life of another lad It appeared that there had been a struggle between them, and that the prisoner stabbed the deceased with a small penknife. The blade entered the heart of the deceased, and he died almost immediately. According to the law, any one under seven years of age was consideredincompetent toentertaiathatdescriptionotmrlio which the lawrequired to support a charge of wilful murder*. but between that age and 14 the jury were justified in inferring malice if the nature of the act justified them In so doing. The prisoner In this case, he believed, would only bo charged with the crime of manslaughter and if the evidenceshould make out thathe was aware of tiheharaoter of the act he was committingthey would be justified in finding a bill for that offence. The remaining case of murder to which he had to direct their attention was one of a much more serions character. It was a charge against a man named Thomas Robert Daris of murdering his wife by, cutting her throat, and it appeared that the prisoner and the deceased were heard to be quarrelling in the room they occupled, and the prisoner, who had been drinking, abused the deceased, and she was heard to exclaim, "You are going to murder me." Very soon after this the poor woman staggered out of the room with her throat cut, and the prisoner did not deny that his was the hand that com- l mitted the act, and if these facts should be made out he apprehended they would have no alternative but to find the bill against the prisoner. With regard to the two cases of manslaughter, the only question for their consideration was whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant them in fnd. ing the bills, and he felt it was unnecesssry for him to make any observationsrespectingthem. HisLordshipthenreferred toa charge of a felonious assanlt upon a young girl by a person named Clayton; and he said it appeared to him that although in a moral point of view the conduct of the pdisorer as a married man with a family, and the master of the girl who was the prosewutrix, was undoubtedly mout disgraceful, yet, from the depoitions, he was of opionthat the conduct of the prosecutrix and the statements made by her immediately after thetrausaction rendered it very doubtful whether a conviction would take place, and if that should be the opinionaof the grand jury it would be much better for the Interests of justice that an inquiry of this description should not be publicly gone into. The only remaining case to which he consddered it neessary to allude was a chage against a person aamed Thomas Plant Rose, who would be indicted tormidemeanour under the Statute of the 6th and 7th of VIctoria, which ena cted that if any person should threaten to publish any written or printed paper, or to abstain from publishing such written or printed paper, with a view to extort money, or to obtain any office of profit or emolument he bshould be deemed guilty of misdemeanour, and be liable to certain punishments fixed by the Act. It would xppear from the depositions that this charge arose out of the recent election of Lord Mayorin this city,and thot therebeingat one period an apprehension that theaelection would be contestedsome proposal wasmade foremploying the defendant as a sort of agent during the contest. It appeared that he had made various statements to the effect that a sum of money had been put down for the purpoeo of oppostng the election of one of the candldates, and that it would be necessary for him to put down a larger sum to secure his election. It appeared that eventually it was resolred not to employ tbe defendant as an agent, and it seemed that he upon this threatened to publish a certain,placard; and this was the ground for the present proceeding. Thequestion for them to consider upon these facts was whether this was done with a view to extort money or to obtain the office of agent. At the time the placard was produced it would appear that the defendant was distinetly told that his services would not be required, and upon these facts the grand jury would consider whether the threat to publish was made with a view to extort money, or whether it was not done from a feeling of spite and revenge at not obtaining the appoinmaent he had solicited; and if the grand jury should believe that the proceeding of the defendant arose from the latter cause it was his duty to tell them that the case would not come within the statute, and they ought not to fnd the bill, unless they were clearly satisfied that the object of the defendant was to extort money or to obtain some office of Profit. The graad jury then retired to their room. Mr. Johnson WVlliam Doyle, the master of the ship John Sugars, surrendered to take his trial uponran indictment which charged him with aseries of aggravated assaults upon Robert Eastwick, an apprentice on board the same vessel. Mr. Bodkin, Mr. Clerk, and Mr. Poland conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Board of Trade; Mr. Serjeant Parry was specially retained, with Mr. Lawrence and Mr. PF. ,. Lewils, for the defendant. Mr. BODgrc, in opening the case for the prosecution, said that the Government had felt it to be their duty to institute the present prosecution against the defendant, because from circumstances that had come to their knowledge through a very salutary provision in a statute that had been recently enacted, which required a record of all proceedings of an important character that took place during the voyage of a merchant vessel to be submitted to the inspection of an ofaicer appointed for the purpose, they had reason to believe that the boy Eastwiok had been treated in a most cruel manner by the defendant, and that there were some grounds for supposing that he had at last actualy committed suicide from the terror that had been created in his mind, with a view to escape from the cruelty. Several witnesses were then examined on behalf of the prosecution, two or three of whom were negroes, and one an Austrian seaman, and from their evidence it appeared that the John Sugars sailed from Hartlepool on a voyage to Ceylon In the month of May, 1856, and that the deceased, who was a lad 15 years old, was one of the apprentices, and acted as cabin boy on board the vessel. According to the evidence of the witnesses, very soon after the vessel sailed the defendant assaulted the lad several times with great violence, and that he also compelled him to walk about the deck at night with a heavy capstan bar in his hand carried as a gun, and deprived him by this means of his rest. It also appeared that on the 18th of August an alarmn was iven Tat the boy Eastwick was overboard, and he was drowned, and his body was never recovered. This fact appeariDg on the logbook, coupled with the omission of any statement that means were taken to save the boy, it appeared had led to the present prosecution being institutedl. These witnesses were subjected to a very searching crossexsmination by Serjeant P, iRRY, and it appeared evident from the answers given by some of them that there was a good deal of ill-feeling against the defendant on board this vessel, and it appeared that when she arrived at Point de Galle compiaints were made of their conduct, and one or two of them were imprisoned, and they afterwards deserted from the John Sugars, and one of them also admitted that he had deserted from another vessel caUed the Tamsr. It also appeared that they had threatened that they would ruin the defendant, and that there had been disputes between them un the subject of the wages due to them, and the derondart was summoned before a magistrate. It was lkcewise admitted that at the time the poor lad fell overboard he was engaged in cleaning the cabin, and that ha had to get water in a buacket from the side of the ship, and that he might have fallen overboard by accident while so engaged. It also appeared that the moment the alarm was given the ship was put about, and kept near the spot for more than an hour, and that the defendant had a lfebuoy in his band, but, as the body of the boy wasnever seen, it was, of course, useless to tbrow it into the water. Mr. Serjeant PARsRy, in the course of a very able speech to the jury on behalf of the defendant said he did not at all complain of the Government having instituted the present prosecution, with a view to protect persons placed in the position of this unhappy lad, because there could be no doubt from disclosures that had recently been made publie that very great cruelty was frequently practised in merchant vessels at sea, Iand It was undoubtedly the duty of the Government to endeavour by all the means in its power to put a Istop to such proceedigs He was sure, however, ho ,that the jurywould not allow the disolosures to which hehbadref6rred to prejudice unfairly the case of the defendant, and that they would not forget the responsibility that devolved upon a person in his position, and that if they thought he was not proved to havo exerclsed any unnecessary violence towards this lad, or that no more was done than was required for tho preservation of the necessary disoipline on board the vessel, they would not convict him on the present charge. The learned serjeant then called the attention of the Jury to the fact that the crew of the vessel was composed partyt of negroes and foreigners, who were evidently actuated by vindictive feelings towards the defendant, and he said that his instrnetions were that there was no real foundation for the charge against the defendant, and tnat it had been trumped up by the witnesses for their own purposes. Three or four witnesses were called for the defence, and some of them contradicted the evidence given by the witnesses for the prosecution as to what occurred upon the occasion when the assaults were alleged to have been com- mitted. The defendant also received a good character for I humanity and kindness of diposition from several witnesses, one of them a merchant ship captain, named Scott, who stated that it was a very common punishment in filcted upon apprentices on board ship to make them carry a capstan bar for two or three hours, and he said that It had been inflicted upon himself, and he would rather have had the rope's end. (A laugh.) His reason for this ws, he said, that It was over sooner. (Renewed laughter.) The REcohDER then summed up, and the jury, after a short deliberation, found the delendant Guilty upon the thira count of the indictment, which charged him with having committed a common assault. The REcoBD}E having directed the defendant to be placed in the dook proceeded to pass sentence upon him, and in so deing he observed that he had been convicted of an assault upon evidence which was quite conclusive to the Court and the jury, on a boy on board a ship of which he was the commander, and that no excuse could be offered for that assault. It was, of course, very necessary that disciplne should be preserved on board ship, and the Court would he very sorry to do anything that was likely at au to interfere with the proper authorlty of the oommander of a vessel, but, at the same time, It should be known that every boy or other person engaged on board ship was under the protection of the law, and that every excess of authonty would meet with punishment. he was gratified to find that the new statute which directed that the log of every vessel upon Its arrival should be submitted to the examirnation of a competent officer, who had thus an opportunity of causing inquiry to be made into all 'he circumstances connected with any act of personal violence that appeared to have been committed on board, either by the captain or any other officer, was likely to have a very salutary effect, and he hoped that the present prosecution would tend to make its provisions more extensively circulated. It should be known by all persons in the position of the defendant that every act of violence was sure to be inquired into, at whatever distance from the shores of this country it might have been committed. In the present case it apeared that in a moment of excitement he had assaulted this unfortunate boy In a very violent manner, and if the jury had convicted him upon any of the more serious counts in the indictment he should certainly have inflicted a much more severe sentence than the one he was about topronounoe. The jury had convicted him of one awault only, but there was too much reason to suppose that this unfortunate boy ad suffered a series of acts of violence at his hands, and there was also considerable ground for believing that he had been dziven to the act of self-destruction to escape from the violence to which he was subjected. He then sentenced the defendant to be l'mpriso-ied in Newgate for three months. Pichard Knowles, 19 a respectable-lookin lad, described as a clerk, pleaded ' Guilty" to an indictment which charged him with stealing a check for 001., the property of Benj min Bateman and another, his masters, Mr. ?OLAD, who appearod for the prosecution, said that theprisoner had been in the servioe of the prosecutors for 18 onts, and he w sorry to Inform the Court that he had stolen several other checks that had been intrasted to him for the payment of insursaces and other purposes, besides the one referred to In the Indictment to which he had The prisoner was sentenced to five years' penal servitude. NEW COIURT. (BRef pe the COSIMON-SEnJLAUWT) John Green saurendered to take his tri for an ssault upon Moheooddeen, a Las}r seaman, upon the high seas. MIr. Ribton proseouted and Mr. Sleigh defended. In this case, which was reported at some length last session, It will be recollected that the jury, after being locked up all night, were discharged without coming to any decision, and the defendant was liberated upon his own recognizances to appear this session for triaL. Upon that occasion 11 of the jury were for an acquittal. The fscts proved in evldence this day were the same as upon the former occasion. The defendant wus first mate on board the Dominion, homel from Bombay, and the prosecutor ws one of the Lascar crew shipped at that port, According to the story of the prosecutor the assult took place when the vessel was about three weeks' sail from Bombay,d as he alleged, the defendant seized him by thehair, threw him upon deck, and Idcked two of his teeth out. One of the teeth prosecutor produced in oourt, stating that he had lost the other during the voyage home. For the defence the charge of ault was denied, and evidence called to prove that the only violence that took place during the voyage was when off the coast of CornwaaU the prosecutor, from some neglect, imperilled the ship, and that the defendant, on retrieving the error, gave the prosecutor a violent push to get him oat of hls way. It was Also sworn that when the prosecutor was shipped at Bombay he had some of his teeth out, and that duning the voyage he was noticod to be puling his mouth about, and said that one of his teeth was loose. Mr. SL=Gs, having addressed the jury at some length, called witnesses to prove these facts, and also that the defendant and the captain of the vessel bore very high characters for humanity. Mr. RrwTox baving repUed, The Cormmox-SXRnAA2T =i ed up with great minuteness, and told the jury that the question for them to decide was which party was speaking the truth. The jury, having been out of court about 20 minutes, returned a verdict of Xot Guilty, and the defendant was discharged.

The prisoners were spoken to as having been at the King's Head several times before, and on the evening of the robberv, but not afterwards, and they were committed for trial.

She (Peach) then said to me, "Then you go to Mrs. Richardson and tell her she must know that I am in Horsernonger-lane Gaol, where she ought to be, and that it she does not provide me with money for counsel, and also maintain me while here, I shall not be quiet. She knows she had a share of the property, and can do it." I (said the witness) took this message to the prisoner, who sdd in reply, "If Ihad my share of the money I have not been such a fool with it as they have been. I am making good une of It, and tell her I shall give her nothing." T reply to the message Icommunicated to Mrs. Peach, at Horsemonger-lane Gaol, who told me to come, back to rs.

Mitohell, Sth RIegiment, who was placed under arrest at Shornoltffe, with orders to proceed to Chatham garrison for the purpose of being tried by general Courtmartll on sereral charges of disgraceful conduct and drunkenness while on duty, has broken his arrest and gone to the continent, leaving behind him a letter, addressed to the Adjutant of the corps, in which he states that, as there was no doubt whatever of his being found guilty by the general Court-martial, and, consequently, dismissed from the service, be declined taking his trial, and had proceeded to France. In consequence of the course taken by the prisoner HIer Majesty wiLl direct his dismissal from the ermy. Yesterday Captain C. C.

THE REINfORCEMENTS FOR INIA. (Yrom 7'/taCW3 O'rland ZYcws.) IThe following is a complete and corrected list of the transports whiio have sailed for India with reinforoements of troops to supprees the Sepoy mutinies; aiso the vessels engaged to take out tho regiments last ordered to India, and now embarking. Those vessels named as destined for Ceylon touch at Ptint de Galle for final orders. The movements of those vessels of whioh we have any tidings are given in the footnotes. Since our last issue six more vessels have sailed, conveying 2,470 troops, making a total of 84 ships, having en board a, force of 32,664, -which have left for India since the news of the Indian mutinies reached home ; and if to those be added the 904 which hove been despatcheci by the Suez route, the total amounts to a force of 33,568 officers and men. The four vessels now preparing to saU with an additional 2,169 will maeKe up the total to 35,729; to which if we add 1,000 mnon now ready for embarcation at the Provisional Battalion at Chatham, and the three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry under orders for India, will make up the force despatched by the homie Government to upwards of 40,000 officers and men, of Infantry, cavalry, Artillery, and -Engineers. The notices appendcd to the foot of the table of the progress made by a large number of the transports muust strengthen our anticipation of the rapid passage many of these vessels will achieve, And with the exceptioa of a short dolay of one ship at Lisbon, and the return of onother to Plymouth by the late gale, it is gratifying to find that the efforts of the mercantile marine in equipping such a noble fleet at a mo-nent of great pressare have up to the present time been attended with such marked success. Judging frem the data here afforded, we may confidently anticipate that their efforts will have landed nearly the whole 40,000 on Indian soil before the close of the year.

THB BIGHT HON. W. BERESFORD, .-P ON TBB IrIDIA N MUTIN[ES. SAFFRON WALDEN, OUT, 25. Yesterday an imp ortant and -2fiaential gathering of the Conservative elect rs of thls district of the northern division of Essex took pI-ce in this town for the purpose of hearing from tleOir mernbers, the Pight Ron. Wiltiam Beresford and Mr. Charles Ducaae, an explanation of 'their views endI sentne'euts on the present state of affairs in the East, uad also on the political aspect of our ovrn costtry. Therm were 'boa t 70 present at the usual matket tate at the Rose and VYCown Inn, the chair being ably tiled by Mr. JToin 'Y.aydon, an extensive landholder in tho district, the company comprising al the large agriclturists of the neighbourhood. Due honour h wving been palddtothe loyal toasts, The Css INL4.N, with a few appropriate Observations, proposed "The Army and Navy -of England." which was drunk with enthusiasm. Lientenant-Celonel BRtSE, iin responding, said the energies of England had never been more aroused than at the present moment; they had perhaps been equalled, but never Buswasn d. They were equsllad in 1803, when, after the peaoe of Amiers, their enemics assembled and threatened to come ever to this country, and 400,000 vvlanteers offered their services for the defence of England. (Cheers.) It was not now necessary to raise 40D, 000 men for the conquest of India, as they oould do with a less number; but when 'be heard that in the ordisary way of recruiting at the rate of 800 were coming In every 48 hours, he felt that their energies equalled those of 1803. (Cheers.) With regard to India (to -use an agricultural expression), they had farmed it badly, for they had taken from it all tbey could get, and had put inas aittle as possible; they had not only neglected to sow the-seeds el'Christianity and to cultivate the minds of the heathen, but they had encouraged those heretics and infidels in the practice of their abominable super. stitione ed cruelties. (Cheers.) Some people said it wasgood polioy to respect the opinions of those wlho were overned; but-if policy were to ba taken by suc^ess, what tad been thesuccess in this instaunoel Was It not the rebellion of that parb of Her Majesty's dominions? Froui the well-known cruelty of the native ESindoo they migLt have expected the atrocities which had been committed. But the fault was their own, ard now they had not only to subdue India egain, but they had to subdue the hearts of those infamous wretches who had risen in revolt against them and to punish the guilty. (Cheers.) They must not be ashamed of their Christianity any longer, and then he believed the honour of England would be safe, and the success of British arms world bring down upon the rebels a stern but just retribution. (Loud cheers.) The CHAiR.mN then proposed "The Health of the Members for the Northern Division of Essex," feeling assured that though they might deem it advisable to give, their support to Lord Palmerston in the suppression of the Indian mutiny, they wouid not stultify themselves or forget thal there were certain great Conservative principles they were elected to support and uphold. (Drank with loud oneers.) The liiht Hon. W. BEREISFoMRD, after expressing the pleasure he felt at meeting a portion of his constituents said an allusion had been made to his support of Lord Pal merston; but he begged to assure them that he was not one whit a greater Whig now than he was the first moment he offered himself to their notice. (Cheers.) But if, in the -course of political events, he saw that it was necessary for the maintenance of the integrity of the empite that he should support the present Government, he trnsted that the constitueney which had returned him would not think him guilty of any breach of honour to them when he said now, as he had said at other places, that he did not thinkc in the preseat crisis it was his duty to harass or embarrass a Government which was doing the best in its power for the maintenance of the honour and safety of the empire. (Loud cheers.) There were, however, eertain principles and certain questions of public conduct which would make one come forward and manfully oppose the Government that brought suclh measuLres forward. (Cheers.) Against those principles and measures, if put forward improperly and unfairly, he should ever take his stand, and in the defence and mainte. nance of the true agricultural interest they would never iind him wanting. (Cheers.) If a Whiz minlstry would bring forward Radical messures that would affeot the stability of the throne and the maintenance of their institutions In church and state, none would be more ready than himself to rush to the breach in the defence of those interests. (Cheers.) But in the present crisis they did not know that such were in dancer; they, however, knew that the empire of India was threatened, and the Government was desirous of saving that rich treasure to this country and of preserving what wac one of the brightest jewels in the English crown, and he could not withhold his aslistance from a Ministry having that object In view. (Cheers.) Last sess4on the interests of his constituents were triflingly endangered, and whenever that was the ease he was found at his post. The Staticties Bill was one upon which he knew tney had strong feelings, and whenever that was to be brought forward he was ready with his hon, colleague to protect their interests. That Bill was postponed till next session, when it would be brought on again, and he should like to know their pleasure concerning it. (Hear, hear.) In the inext session t so great questions would eugage the attention of the Legislature; these would be the new Reform Bill aud the debate upon the case of India. With regard to the new Reform} Bill, the other day at Castle Redingham a lma was held out to him to speak his opinions upon that measure, but he abOtained from doing so, because it was a matter respecting which they were very much in the dark, the only man who could know any,hing about it being Lord Pelmerston himself; and If under such circumstances a member were indueed to speak his sentiments he might compromise himself on some matter which was not fully thought of, or he might promise his support to a mpasure which he could not afterwards approve. He hoped that at Walden they would allow him to maintain the same obscure line of conduct; but he did not object to tell them this:-Euowing, as he did, the importance of the agricultural interest, anything which should threaten to injure that interest would find in him a firm and unhesitating opponent. (Loud cheers.) The Reform Bill, to a certain degree at least, was a dangerous measure, for if upon a stiff incline they put a large stone in motion, they could not tell bov far it might go, nor whom it might strike in its progre-s. (Cheers.) He was, not however, in opnosition to the renmedying of existing evils when he said that the present Reform Bill was a dangerous experiment; but he must assert that he was not perfectly enamoired w7ith the present Reform Bill. He remembered it was brought forward for political purposes, and with a view to the annihilation of the Tory interest, and therefore how could he be greatly enamoured of that measure? (Cheers.) To it Lord John Russell adhered for many years, and declared that he could not afford to have a revolution every quarter of a century; neverlhelebs, when he said that the purposes of tho Blllhad miscarrHed, and, notwithstanding all the powersof the messure, that the degraded Tory interest raised its heed again, then his Lordship's finality notions vanished, and he was for a rew Refora Bill at any cost or price. (Cheers and laughter.) Having said thus much upon the subject of the ,eform Bill, they would allow him to maintain silence as to the course he should pursue untfl the nature of the measure was better known, at the same timne pledging himself that in anything he did he should not forget the maintenance of the agricultural interest and those rights to which their wealth and thoir well-known attachment to the Crown and their established reliion far more entitled them than their numbers. (Laud ch ers.) The other question wBs one upon which every man thought more or less. With regard to India there were two great points to be considered -first, how the rebellion might be put down; and, secondly, how they might hope to govern that great empire so as to prevent the nmutiny occurring again; and until that was done they were neglecting their duty to the millions con. fided to their care, and whom they ought to rule as in the sight of the great God. First, then, as to putting down the outbreak, and of that he had no fear. (Hear.) He had the most perfect confidence in the bravery of their troops, aud, under the able gereralship of Sir Colin Campbell, when the reinforcements reached India the mutiny would be crushed at once. Fifty thousand troops were not to be despised in any land, but when they thought of 50,000 of their bravest men led by Sir Cohn Campbel and tupported by such men as Havelock and his coadjutors there could be no doubt of a glorious victory. (Cheers.) Why, the very blood which the Sepoys had .shed would frighten them at every corner; thoy would be confronted with the English soldier, who would never hurt a woman, but who, enraged and indignant at the atrocities committed, would dash his glittering steel through the murderers, and hurl them to destruction down the waters of the Ganges. (Prolonged cheering.) Then came the question, " How are the rebels to be 'munished?" It had been sad that in his speech at Hedinghaia he was for Indiscriminate slaughter. Now, he most positively denied such an assertion. He then said they must punish the Sui.ty, nod not show mercy. Talk to him of nercy to those 'oetches who had murdered innocent children and violated unoffending women ! He shuddered at the very thought of indis. criminate slaughter, but those who bad comm'tted the atrocities which filled their hearts with pain and anguish ou-ht to be punished without mercy. And as to therasing of Delhi, those who cried out against it knew nothing of the prestige of that city, which had been the seat of the power of the Mogul, and from which had gone forth the most violent spirit of oppositlon to British rule in India. If Delhi were destroved the Moslem prestige would be annihilated, and the nucleus of power would be broken up, which otherwise might be employed in creating another insurrection. (Loud cheers.) And those, too, who argued for the preeservation of Delhi betrayed their ignorance of Hindoo obariacter, for the more lenity ihera was shon'n to the Hindoos the deeper would be the impression unon their mind that the Europeans were afraid of themn. (Cheers.) These were his views of the matter, and he thought they would see that. while be deprecated indiscriminate slaughter, he asked for justice only; he asked for the justice of the soldier upon the rebels for the sake of the women and children who had been so barbarouely murdared. (Cheers.) As to the future he could say but little, for when they had put out the rebellion and quenched the mutiny it would be no easy matter to say how India should be governed. (Hear, hear.) Whatever had been the faults of pngland, its rule of India bad been mild to a degree in comparison with that of its native princes ; and that, he feared, bad indirectly rather tended to the promuotion of the rebellioni than to checking it. He feared thai _ had been faults in the governmlent of India; he feared It was too true that acts of tyrannY had bean perpetrated. (EHear.) But, admitting the very worst, English rule in India Wa been that of a paternal nature, instead of the most absoluto IdesPOtisftm ad tyranny. (Cheers.) He believed the great sin they had committed was in keePing the Bible out of the I Government schools. He was no advocate for proselytizig Ithe people,..but from thae schLools under the patronage of a uroessdlo2sisisnnaionth Bileought not to have teenexclded TheBishp o Oxfrd ight perhaps call thi tiidiy, u.the Hr.Berafod)looxed upon it as a recean deialof he aviur nd isGospel. (Cheers.) Theyshold nt frce eliion ownthe threat of the Hindo, ut tey houl uger dgy ~9~au4 deny tb?,q vwhich they bolieved to be saered .and true. (Loud aheera.) His attention had been drawn to a letter published in a lnai paper, upota which he felt he ought to make an obserstion or twvo in order to Eet himself nght with his constituents. The writer said *o wonder that 'The Titneis pleased when it fna an old and teated member of the ConrbrvatLve coonexion inanil&g in ea ereStng a condemnation of his frIends No wonder they forgot the vast end eubatituted the moet honeyed anooente for thdrwordA of gall" He must say that no man was more sorprised than he was that The Times should say one word on his behalf, and he eertainly did not expect a shower of aplause. But he would say thus much evenin defenee of Vte 2Times, as being the great focus for expressing the opnion of the masses, that he spoke of three facts, and upon those three facts he found the nation nearly all agrz d ; and was it unnattral that if he coincided in his1oipion with the general sentiments of the mrasos he r, d receive from that journal a meed of praise? (Cheers.) The writertthen endeavoured to assiga reasons for the commendation of 1%e Th 2es, and said "Ilia expreions of confidence Ia the eoesmler were protfue a.sd unmeasured. They were exactly thoee in which'The Times' deHghi, becaue they were unenecumbared with the sms1e3t semblnce of "U Unencumbered with the smallest semblance of proof !' Why that -was not a fair statement, and he was at a loss to knowl how any man witb his (Mr. Beresford's) printed speech before him could make such an assertion (cheers), for he staled three distinct proofs. He stated that the Government was doing the best it could; that it had brought the late war to a successful termination, which ho thought their predossoors had not done. (Cheers.) The second proof he addiced was that tbe Government had shown alacrity to the utmaost of the means at their command in the tr.,asDort of troops to the East; and thirdly, that they had chosen the very best soldier they could select to take the command of the army. If these v, ere not proofs, what were they, and where, then, was the truth of the statement that these were "unencumbered with the smallest semblance of proof?' (Loud cheers.) And the writer then went on to say that he (Mr. Beresford) founded his trust in Lord Palmerston in consequence of his having reduced the army against his convictions. A more deliberate falsehood than that was never uttered (loud cheers), for he positively stated that his confidence was not four ded in Lord Palmerston for his reduction of the army urder the influence of his enemies combining together to com 1 him to do so, as that was the very point upon which he ',amed the noblelord. If the gentleman whowrote that Setter was not logical he was certainly malignant enough. (Cheers.) He would not have introduced this subject but to set himself right with his constitrents; and now he begged to resume his seat, thanking them for the honour t;hey had done hiu . (Loud cheehrs.) Milr. CH.ULES Du'caSE then addrossed the meeting at great length, and after referrisg to mattegs of a local nature he said, five years ago they bad a Mlinistry in power of which his hon. colleague was a member, which showed by the tenour of their legislation toiat they under. stood the business-like maxim of never putting off till to. morrow what could be done to-day; but now they had a Ministry whose policy was the very converse of that, and who never performed to-day what it could put off tiU tomorrow. (Laughter.) Five years ago they, as Conservatives, had a statcsman to whom they could look up, and in whom they could place confidence; but now they were urnder a Government in which, as a party, they had no confidence, and one man was put forward as alone fit to be the leader of the nation. (Laughter.) While he would offer no opposition to Lord Palmerston, but support him in vigorous mea ures for the suppression of the Indian rebellion andin inflictimg retributivejustice upontheguilty, he did not feel bound toabuegateall his politicalprinciplesandoplnions and bow the knee to this Palmerstonian dictatorship. (Cheers.) In their anxiety for the restoration of govern meat in t ndia they must not forgeb what was necessary for home, and now, if they had a statesman atthe head of affairs with one set of principles at his heart and another upon his lips, seeking to guide the vagaries of a body having no prinoiples at all, he legislated with the sword of Damocles suspended overhis head. (Cheers.) Andwas Potthisthecondnct of thePremier now, and was It not apparent in the progress of his church legislion ? By the aid of the Conservativei he nmight defy the baliot and laugh to scorn the newest measure of reform, but he would not raise his hand to maintain the Christian character of their Houses of Legislatare, or take one step to prevent the inroad sought to be made upon the established roeliion of these realms by the abolition of church rates. (Cheers.) With reference to the Indian question, he deprecated the tone assumed by certain organs of the press upon this question, and should look upon the man who from mere political motives opposed Lord Psalmerston in his attempts to suppress the insurrection as one anxious to make political capital out of a national calamity. (Cheers.) And while he should think stch a man deserving universal censure, he rust at the same time say that when he was called upon to give the Premier a meed of praise for his conduct in the past, and unlimited confidence with regard to all measures for the futare, he could not and would not go with him. It was their duty to support the Ministry as far as they consistently could; but if they mistook the magnitude of affairs and the direction they were taking, then it was clearly their duty to sound the notes of wvarning and to oppose them. (Loud cheers.) Sieveral other speeches wfere delivered, and the meeting terminated at an early hour in the evening.
UXIVERSITY INTELZIGENOE. CAMBRnXE. Orm 9 TXhe Vice-Uhancallor Dr. Philpolt met the members of the Senate in the art school as announoed at 2 o'clock to. day for the discussion of Certain observations and sugeestions of the University commissioners in respect to the University statutes. The V1cx-CE .XCELLno said he had met the Senate by the advice of the Council to discuss and give information respecting the questions in the printed paper, one of which was as to the propriety of establishing such preliminary meetings as that present for the consideration of matters to be brought before the Senate. He would take the questions in order. The first was as to the alteration of the academic terms. The commissioners proposed that the Michaclsas Term should commence October 1, and end December 16 - Lent Term to commence January 13, and to end April 7; hEaster Term to commence April 21, and to end July S. Professor GROTE here objected to reporters being present, and a reporter was ordered to retire. The MA1STER of ST. Josi's said the Council had advised the preliminary consideration of these questions, that the decision of them might be the act of the University. It was highly desirable that the statutes passed by the University should not only wear the appearance, but should in realty be the emanation of the acwlemic bodv. The comm)ssiooers insisted on two-thirds of each term being kept; the Council were not wiling to insist on two-thirds of each term. He should himself agree to two-thirds of the two first terms, but not of the Summer Term, which would on many grounds be very inconvenient. Prolessor PRYMrE was in favour of length ning the terms; Dr. PAGET spoke on the same side. Mr. LuARD, of Trinity, thought the terms quite long enough. Mr. HEERVEY GOODWIN was adverse to longthening the Summer Term, as experience showed the students wvould not read as in the other terms. The next question involved the merging of the two houses, Regents Eucd non-Regenls, in one. The VICE-CHANCELLOR said in the event of this proposition beina carried it would abolish the office of scrutator, and change the election of the proctors, who were now elected by the Regents only. Mr. C. C. BABINGTON, of St. John's, was opposed to the merging the tw7o houses, as the opinions of the junior members of the Senate would thereby lose much of their wexg MAsTER of ST. JOHN'S said the reason for the two Houses had ceased to exist, and therefore he thought it advisable they should be united. A long discussion then ensued, in which Mr. H. GOODWim, the VICE-PROVOST of KIaG'S, and others took part. It appeared that the meeting was in favour of retaining th.e present division of the Senate. The next question was the suggestio-n of the comnmissioners that power be given to the Viie-Chancellor of his own discretion, or by advice of the Council, to summon preliminary meetings of the Senate, where proposed graces mirht be discussed and amendments moved. rrofessor SELwYN objected to the Vice-Chancellor being named, asit ought to rest with the Council. Mr. ROBY, of St. John's, thought such meetings should be universal to discuss aU graces. The MASTER of ST. JoiB's said the object was to expe. dite the business of the Senate. Dr. LEAPDrOWVELL, the Senior Esquire Bedell, was prepared to say, after an official career of more than 30 years, that if the new statu.tes did not contain eome provision like that under consideration they would be imperfect. He had often known members of the Senate change their minds three timnes between entering the House and giving their vote, and then discover they had voted wrongly. Questions 5, 6, and 7 comprised some verbal amendments. Question S, to grant higher degrees to persons absent in the colonies, without the necessity of their being present. Question 9, the allowing a Congregation in vacation, Question 10 suiggested the dispensing with a court of heresy for trying heterodox preachers who might appear in the University pulpit. Professor SELWVYN said it ought to be known that the Council had negatived the Proposition for a coux t of heresy by 9 to 4; moreover, he objected to such a tribunal, as it allowed no appeaL Again, the University was not a spiritaal body, therefore incompetent. The bishop was the proper person to interfere. The MASTER of MAcDALENE, as a member of the Council, did not sign the reporc, and could not do so consistently untU some check was interposed. Mr. T. M. JACKSON, of Clare, protested strongly against any court of heresy, as proposed. Dr. LEAPINGWELL agreed with Professor Selwyn. It would be highly inexpedient to attach such a clause to their statutes. It could have no other result than to furnish to some turbulent academies the means of sowing discord and confusion in the University. The bishop was the proper authority. The meeting sat two hours.
THE~ WRECiK oF THE ONTARIO.-On Satiirday e'venin Mr. Press, coroner for Norfolk, held an inquest at Caistor near Great Yarmouth, on the bodies of a seamnan washed ashore from the unfortunate Ontario of South Shields, and of Mrs. Balfour, the wife of the captain of the same vessel, which was lost with nearly all bands, (2.3 in all) in the gale which visited the eatern coast on Thursday night and Friday morning. The bodies, which were much disfigured, were viewed by the juryin the lifeboat house at Caistor, and a verdict of" Accidenatally drowned"1 was returned. The jury at the same time exnressecl a strong opnin to the neglect-ed state into which the lifeboat at Cahi&rhd been suffered to fall, although the navigation on the e.oastis frequently hazardocs. Mrs. Bali our was washed ashore from the Ontario in her nightdress, and a portion of the orew were probably in their berths when the shio struck oiA the sand. The eastern coast hias not becn visited with Baha fearfnl gaile for many y'eam ,
TRR INDIAN RELIBF FUND. 00EELSRA. A meeting ot tke inhabitants of Chelsea was held last evening at toe Royal Military Asylum iu aid of the fund now collecting for the relief of the sufferers by the disastrous events ocutrring in India. Lord CHELSEA took the chair, and in opening the proceedings observed that within the present century nothing had occurred which had so united the syrnpathies of allI classes in these kingdoms as the events which were now engrossing public attention. The outbreak in India had not been a patriotic insurrection on the part of a people, but was the result of a fierce desire for plander and massacre on the part of a well treated soldiery. The first duty of the meeting was to convey to those gallant soldiers now fighting their country's cause in the East an expression of gratitude and admiration which their heroic eftorts had excited throughout Great Britain. Their next duty was to contribute to the relief of those who were reduced to want and distress in consequence of the mutiny, and he hoped that their sympathy would be exhibited by a liberal sabscription. It was not yet the time to discuss the causes of the present state of things in India, and, whatever opinions might be er ertained as to the culpability of the East India Company or the Government, there could be no doubt of the claims which the sufferers had upon all Englishmen. No more acceptable mode of exhibiting their appreciation of the noble efforts of our soldiers in India could be chosen than to assure thote gallant warriors that should they faU in their country's cause those whom they might leave behind would be cared for and provided for by their grateful countrymen. Doprecating as he did for the time all discussion of the causes of the outbreak, he would only temark that he thought, after the Intelligence which bad been received from all quartorg, that they would never hear again that it was the work of the Christia misdonaries. (Hear.) Before sitting down he might acquaint them with the grateful fact, of which In. telligence had just been received, that Delhi had fallen. (Loud cheers). He was constrained to add that the victory had been purchased at a lamentable cost of the lives of 600 men and 40 officers, thus increasing the number of those who would be dependent upon the funds which they had met together to romote. 'Hear.) The Rev. Mr. BURGESS moved the first resolution " ThaLt this meeting deairea to express its hear%teit sorrow at the unparaneled suffee,gu which bave befallen our oountrymenu and countrywomen from tthe grievous autin; and disturbanes which have broken, cutm Inndia ." It was a most gratifying reflection that that meeting was only an indication of the general feeling which animated the whole nation-a feeling of admiration for ths noble heroins exhibited by Englishmen and delicately nurtured Englishlwomen under the most dreadful trials, and of sympathy for the deep distress which had been entailed upon so many individuals and families. The newspapers had recorded instauces of the most wonderful fortitude of womet. who met a cruel death with Christian heroism, and, to quote the language of inspiration, he might say, " Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings God had ordained strength." (Hear.) Those precious martyrs woald for ever be reckoned among tho.e who hadmost worthily maintined the honour and dignity of their race and country. Other nations might naturally enough regard the disastrous events in India with a different feeling from onrselves, but the conduct of those who had undergone the trials in that country had proved to the world that England was prepared of herself to vindicate her rightg, and maintatu ber power. (Hear, hear.) Without probing deeply into the causes of the outbreak, it was impossible to avoid saying somnelhing upon that point. Be could not bat imagine it was a shortsighted arrangement that composed whole regiments solely of high caste Hindoos and ambitious Isahomedans. No doubt it was thought that the one element would neutralize the other, but it had been quite ov,3rlooXed that the Mahomedan had long been assimilating to the Hindoo. The one had a horror of coI's flesh, the other of swneb's flesh, but they both aareed in an ardent desire to terminate the Chr3stian rule. (Hear, hear.) Another mistake he believed had been made In not permitting colonization iu India. 'Until 1813 colonization was entirely forbidden, and even since then it had been allowed only under such narrow regulations that practically it had been discountenanced. The public would be astonished to hear that in all our Indian ewpire, excepting the great cities of Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, there were only 10,006 British reeidents unconnected with the East India Company or the British Government. Exxduding the cities he had mentioned, there were in the preEidency of Bombay only seven such residents, in Madras 37, and in Bengal E73. Had a different course been followed the country wouId have been settled in far groater numbers by Europeans, who would have brought with them their religlon and their civilization, for he contended that Christianity was a necessary part of civilization. (Hear.) He hoped, howevor, the bitter lesson we were now learninz vould not be forgotten, and that Christian Englpd wo be alive to the dntes of her mission, and would no longer for the sake of apparent quiet continue to pander to the prejudices of a savage heathenism. (Hear.) At the same time he did not know that anybody was especially to blame for what bad occurred. All parties were equaly open to rebuke, the Government, the Iegislature, and the people, who until now had taken no interest in our Indisn empire and its swarming millions. Mr. GASKILL seconded the resolution, which was agreed to unanimously. The Rev. T. ALEXANDEu moved the second resolution,"That this meeting regards with deep satidfacon the humane and generous eit which the alamitie s of our Indan fellO-nf Wubjeota have at borne and thatbhrhad n Speaking for himself alone, he must say that he had no sympathy with the notion that the question of India should e considered only 5n its present aspect. He considered that every person in this country had to bear a share of the blameforthemisfortunewhich had occurred. There was one great cause for the visitation, and that vWas that we had not worshipped our God openly in India (hear), and if in ftiture we did not recognize the fact, and act upon it, we could not truly be said to have done our duty. Terrible as the massacres had been, yet they had taken place by God's permission, and probably would be the means of awakening the nation to it& duty in regard to the unenlightened millions over whom we were allowed to rule. The Rev. Mr. RoniysoN seconded the resolution, and eloquently exhorted his hearers to contribute liberally to the wants of the Indian sufferers. With respect to the causes of the mutiny, he reminded the meeting that Nena Sahib, who had been described as a fiend incarnate, had been educated in a Government school-a school where the Bible was prohibited. (Hear.) * The Rev. W. MONcRIEF' moved the third resolution, pledging the meeting to contribute to the fund for the relief of the Indian sufferers. The Rev. Mr. JoNEs seconded the resolution, which was unanimously adopted. A vote of thanks was passed to the noble chairman, and the meeting separated, a liberal collection being made at the doors,
FRIGHTvTIL OCCuRRECE.-Yesterday afternoon, about 1 o'clock, as a cattle van was conveying from the London Docks a remarkably fine specimen of the Bengal tiger, recently imported by Mr. Jamrach, the eminent naturalist in that neighbourhood, the latch or lock of the door gave way, and the animal, finding itself at liberty, bonnded into the road, to the intense terror of the passers by. For some distance it proceeded rapidly up the carrage-way in a crouching position, evidently as. tonished at its unexpected freedom, until, by a fatal chance, it encountered at the corner of Bell's-street a little boy, aged 11 years, who stood gazing curiously at the strange spetacle. Before the lad had time to escape from the savage animal's path it sprang upon him, lacerating the back of bis neck and head in a frightful manner. In the meantime one of Mr. Jamrach's men, who had followed tbebeast in its flight, had armed himself with a crowbar, with which he struck repeated blows on the animal's head, to compel it to relinquish its grasp. The last of tbese blows took effect, and so far stunned the creature as to enable it to be secured, but we regret to say the bar, glancing from the skull of the brute, inflicted a blos' upon the head of the already fearfully mangled little sufferer, who was promptly removed to the London Hospital, where he lies in a very precarious condition. But slight hopes are entertained of his recovery. ACC1DEXT ON THE SO=-EASTeRN RAILWAY.- On Saturday afternoon a collision took place near the Bricklayers' Arms station of the South-Eastera Railway between a passenger and goods train. The passenger train had dis. chargod its passengers at London-bridge, and was proceeding on the Bricklayers' Arms line to have the carriages cleaned. It had arzived at the Grayhound-bridge when a goods train suddenly emerged from a siding, also in the direction of the station, and before it ceould be stopped came in contact with the passenger train, knocking over tho truck, a first and second class carriage, and forcing them one over the other. The life of the guard was fully expected to have been sacrificed, but in a few minutes after the shock he was seen to crawl out from the break, having only suffered a few sllght injuriez. The carriages were much injtured, and the line was blocked for two or three hours. Had the passengers been in the train there wotld in all probability have been loss of life or injuries of a serious pharaoter sustained.
ASIATIC AND EUROPEAN MUSSULMAN& TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir, -From the roport you have just published of the prooeedingel at the Leicester county meeting the atrocities committed by the Asiatic Musaulmans in India are represented by the Duke of Rutland as " exceeding anything the world bad ever witnessed." This is, no doubt, the general impresslon with those who do not recoUect the manner in which, prior to the liberation of Greece from the Turkish yoke, tens of thousands of unoffending Greek Christians had been sacrifioed in a still more atrocious manner, if possdble, by the European disciples of Mahomet, without distinction of age or sex. This fact will appear by the enclosed letter I have just received from an Ionian gentleman who has been Secretary of the Greek Legation here, and who, with these atrocities freh in his recoUection, proposes that a legion of his countrymen should be raised for India to vindicate suoh glaring violations of the doctrines of Christianity in both quarters of the globe by the disciples of Mahomot,-a via. dication wvhich he alleges would be accomplished by his countrymen with a far greater degree of enthusiasm than I by any Europaan levies whose countrymen or countrywomen had never experienced Mahomedan ferocity. How far these facts are borne out by the contents of this letter I must leave your readers to judge, if you should deem it deserving of their attention at a period like the present, when every exertion is being made to send all our available forces to a distance of so many thousand miles, leaving our own shores comparatively unprepared for any unforeseen emergency that might in the space of 24 hours expose our own homes to piUlage, and our fair countrywomen to the rade embraces of those who profess the doctrines of Christ. ianity, but which are not always practised by men who seek " a bubble reputation in the cannon's mouth." I mean no disparagement to the troops of any continental nation when Isaythis, asI have witnessed during our war in Spain, after our capture of Spanish fortresses from the French British soldiers perpetrating acts of brutality on the unoffending inhabitants that could not be exceeded by thetroops of anyEuropean nation,asvwhen oncethetiesofdisclplinewere broken in carzying atoWn bystorm, and these soldiers could help themselves to inebriating beverages without re. straint, they became as great a source of terrorto their friends as they had previously been to their foesin the open field. I do not mean to assert, Sir, that there is a probability of any such scenes being enacted in this capital, or in any other of our open and unprotected towns; but as selfpreservation is the f£rst law of nature, it appears to me that as long as there is a possibility of such a contingency it should be the duty of our rulers to provide against it as far as possible, and that while they can get foreign troops to aid our cauno in India they should not denude our own shores of native soldiers, the best calculated for their protection, and that they should not hedtate to give the preference to tbose adverted to in the enclosed, as the most desirable for that purpose. It is my intention, under these circumstances, to forward copies of the enclosed to the proper quarters, as therein suggested, and as a subject so interesting to the British puW6 ought not, in my humble opinion, to be looked upon as private or confidntal, placing a copy of it in your hands may be the means of insuring it a degree of attention to which it might not otherwise be deemed entitled. Thst this Ionian diplomatist stands high in the opinion of some of the authorities who ruled in the Ionian Islands subsequent to their annexation to the British Crown will appear by the following extract from a pointed publicatiou addressed to Lord John Russell in 1850 by Lord Charles Fitzroy, who was for many years Governor of one of those islands:- " I have had occasion for some years past to observe the sincere and generous patriolism of this gentleman, and have been aware of his earnest and untiring efforts in behalf of his countrymen, when others shrank back from the task daunted and disappointed. Fortunate, indeed, has it been for the Ionians that the English edrcation of this gen. tleman under high auspices, his long residence in this country, and his positionbave enabled him to fight their battles for many years, alinat single-handed, under very discouraging cii:umstances, to whal is no rlikely to be a successful issue." " C. FITZROY." I have the honour to be, Sir, your very obedient servant. J. S. LI VcE. -'1 " Mon cher General,-The present crisis in India calls not only orn those that have English blood in their veins to rnsh to anms and punish the sanguinary and treacherous mon. sters who committed such enormous atrocities, but on the Christian wo-ld in general, and particularly upon those Christian nutlons who owe gratiwude to England or that are living under her protection. " Among these nations the Greek stand- foremost, for it is to England that & great portion ol' it oaves its independence, when first the voice of your great statesman, George Canning, was (just 30 years ago) raised against similar, if not greater, atrocities committed on thousands and thousands of the innocent population of Greece, who had no share in her revolution, by Mussulman fanaticism and savage ferocity. " By information lately received, and a suggestion just made to me by the editor of an influential leading London journalIwhose letter I enclose, I ventureto call your attention to a subject which, If carried out, will enable you to render your country as brilliant and important services as those you rendered her dm.rg your glorious career in the late Peninsular War, so conspicuously adverted to in the leading journal of this country about ayearago. " You are aware that a BiU passed in Parliament last session ny which my countrymen, tl-e Ionians, can enter the service of Her Majesty as soldiers and sailors on the same footing as born Englishmen. This, therefore, is the time to give the Ionian people the opporturtmy of showing their attSacment to the protection ot Great Britain, and thas smother the voices of their detractors, who are attempting to represent them as discontented and disloyal to our gracious Queen. " A legion of Greeks may be raised in the Ionian Islands with the greatest facility and in the shortest time. I need not tell yoa with what enthusiasm a Greek would rush to the service of Her Majesty if told that his sword is required to punish the sanguinary miscreants who have dared to commit the same atrocities on the wives and virgins of your great nation as were committed 35 years ago on thousands of their own inmocentcountrymenand courtrgwomen by the brutat Mahomedans. You have but to open the pages of the Hfistory of the Gr eck Rcroluticn by Mr. Tricoupi, the present Greek Mginister to the Court of London, and yo wiul find an exact paraUel to the present Indian horrors with those committed by the Asiatic Mussulman savages on the peaceful Greek citizens, their wives and daughters, with the horrible addition that they spitted and roasted alive their prisoners and their hosta,es, and set fire to the under garments of the old women, bmrning them alive, while they hanged the babies to the brarches of trees and fired at them as targets, for their amusement ! All these atrocities are graphically detailed in the history alluded to. and are engraven in burning characters on the memory of every Greek. How true, therefore, the opinion of x. Lamoine, in the Revue des deux Molndes (published in The Times of this day), when he says, 'Pus on is imposdible between the Christian and the Mussulman; one mnst give place to the othor.' "You, Sir, whose vigour of mind and activity are so well known, may undert-4ke the tas': under such momentous cirruatestnces of raising a corps in the lon£an Islatnds, to be called the ' Greek Legion,' and lead them to victory not only against the treacherous enemies of Great Britain, but against thleir own natuaral and inveterate foss, the lMu:ssul. mnans " No German, Swiss, or Italian legion can show a tenth of the enthusiasm in fighting against the followers of Mahomet as a Greek would. They will vindicate yours as well as their own wrongs on that abhorrent race,1whose creed teaches them that the murder of a Christian and the torturing of his wife and children are agreeable to their Prophet and to God. On this fanatical belief the fair mothers and daughters of England were subjecled to indignities which delicacy forbids my mentioning, and then butchered by those Mahomedan tigers ! " You, Sir, if my suggestion meets your approval, have nothing but to propose the project to your Government or to the East India Company; and I feel persuaded it will not be rejected, In which case any influence which I may have with my cruntrymen will be exercised towards the accomplishment of that object. " In reference to the martial spint of the Greeks, pormit me, in conclusion, to refer to the opinion of it of your late friead Sir Charles Napier. That great warrior, in his work on the Colonies, in speaking of the Ionian Islands (pages 15 and 16), says,-' They can fn;aish a considerable Body of seamen, and in time of war could raise a disposable body of 6,000 good soldiers, besides 30,000 militia. A Greek is a soldier by nature, his sht is so keen that it surprises our most expert :iportsmen, his body is well made and active, he is capable of bearing great fatigae, and requires little sustenance.' In another paragraph ,he adds-' In war we possess a defensive force of 30,000 mlitia, a large body of soldiers, and a number of smal vessels reacy at aU times to assist us in any expedition, magazines and safe harbours, a strong influenc at all times on the councils of the Greek Sovereign and nation, and the power of raising on an emergency a disposable auxiliary force of 10,000 soldiers, who, if not equal to British troops, would be much l-ss expensive than they, and equsi to any in the surrounding *With many apologies for the unavoidable length of this letter, I remain. &o..

OrR NATiONAL A.NkTQurrms.-The city of Liverpool is in a fair way of possessing at some day not very remote the first museum of national antiquities in the kingdom.

HOW TO ESTABLISH OUR EMPIRE IN INDrA; (From theiEasmi,zer,) The best wsy to establish our Indian etapire on improge nable foundations wzill be to act upon principles As oppodt3-: as possble to those on which it has been heretofore ruled by that singular corporation the East India Company. For & whole oentury our possession of India has been A mero ilitary occupation, EiX ptrts out of seven of the occupying army being composed of the oonquered races, and the uost. mutinous and inflammable materials which¢ould be ¢olletea together. No wonder that such a government should at last have exploded in mutiny and murder, and wiith such pro. digious havoc of public and private property. The chief meaus by which ether nations of all races ana-- of all ages have mainthined their authority over conquere4 countries have consisted in the free and numerous settle- - ments of tho conquering race among the conquered. But these are the verv means which have been most perimacil and obsunately repudiated by the East India Company_ Colonization was the mode inr which the little country o£ Greece spread its languae, its arts, and its religion over Ihaly, Egyyt, and Asia Minor. It was thus, far more thaz by its legions, that Rome made Italy, France, and Spai Roman in language, laws, manners, and everything comprehended in the Roman name. It was6 the msethed foilowre&b by our Saxon forefathers when they conquered the Britons,. by tho Normuans wben they conquered the Saxons, and by the Anglo-Normans when they subdued the Celts of Wales and Ireland. All over the world it was this plain course that has evert been pursued by conquering states. The Greeks pursued it in Africa and Aia, as they did in Europe. They planted a colony on the very verge of Indi itself, and there, in the midLt of predatory batbarians, unsupported by a mother country, and sonre three thousand miles distant from lt, theyestablished a civilized kingdom which lasted more thea three centuries. Asiatic conquerors have followed the same track wherever they have made permanent conquests. In this manner the Arabs conquered some of the finest parts of Spain, and althongh 3,000 miles distant from their parent country, helddominion over them for eight oenturies. The very TUrks, still more remote from their original seat, and cut off from all communication with it, have held sway over some of the most fruittul provinces of Europe for four centuries. Even the shepherds of Tartary, by virtue of the free settlement of their race In China, have been enabled to establish a dominion, and In generala peaceful and successful one, over an empire twice as populous as India. But the most pertinent instance of all is to be found ia the Mahomedan conquest of India itself, to which we have on former occasions alluded. The original adventurers 'were a sort of marauding crusaders, composed not of one, but of several nations, distinct in manners and language, and united by no common tie sve that of religion Thev settled freely among the native Inhabitants, intemarried. with them, and converted them to a number which is thought at present not to fall short of 10,000,000 B these means, and with the help of a little occasionalfresh blood .romi their parent countries, they were enabled for seven centuries to maintain their asendancy over the Findoos, who always exceeded them in number in the proportion of at lsat 20 to L An Affghan dynasty displaced & luroon an, and a Turcoman an Affghan, and it was nob untUi we ourselves had lopped off the most fertile and productive provinces of tho empire that a Elindoo nation, the Mahratta, obtained a temporary superiority over the l)iahomedans. Let us now glance at the pollcy which we have ourselves pursuedin India, and of which we are now reaping the bitter fruits. That policy has been the very antithesis o£ all that has succeeded with all other nations. We have not only discouraged the settlement and colonization of our own. countrymen, but long visited the very attempt to settle with. pains and penalties. The commercial monopolsts in whose name the conquest was made hoodwinked the nation andthe Legislature, and made them believe that India was safe only in their hands and those of their creatures Here are a few particulars of the legislation made under this pernicious delusion. By the Charter Act of 1793 the simple act of being found iu the East Indies without the leave and license of the East India Company was declared to be " a high crime and misdemeanour." In 1813, or 20 years later, the" high crime and misdemeanour" of being found in the East Indies witbout license was re-enacted. and it was punishod, for the first offence by a fine of 2001., or two months' imprisonment, and for the second of 4001., or four monthi? imprisonment. But, besides the fines and isnpri.- sonment, the functionaries of the Company iu rndia were armed with the power of arresting and ejecting forcibly from India any unlicensed Briton, or at pleasure to revoke licenses without assigning a reason; and if the arrested party prosecuted the Company the proof lay on himself and, failng to prove malice, the law made him liable to treble costs. It was not until 1833, or three-quarters of a century after the victory of Plassey, that the nation caune in some measure to its senses, and then for the first time were Englishmen enabled to visit India without leave and license of the East India Company, on risk of capricious expulsion. Then too, for the first time, were Englishmen enabled to hold the fee simple of laud. Even then-and the prohibition is to this hour unrepealed-Englishmea were excluded from visiting, residing in, or holding land in all the conquests made by the nation during the present century, and these embrace some of tho finest and most extensive parts of Bengal and nearly the whole territory of Bombay. But this is not all; in the greater part of the Indian territory, fluctuating, exces,ive, and arbitrary taxation, bad police and bad las, make it wholly out of the question for Englishmen to invest their capital in land, and the result is that the number of British landholders sprinklled over our vast territory is very trifling indeed. Tho result of this factitious and unnatural systempursued.. by the jealous spirit of monopoly has come to this, that the total number of British-born subjects in India not in the public service amounted, according to the most recent returns made to Parlianient, to 10,000, or, to be correct to an unit, to exactly 10,006, the India-house reporter observ. n on the return that no accession to this number had toen place for 20 years. Nearly the whole of this number resided in the three presidential cities, where they had the protection of English laws administered by professional judges named by the Crow. Of the 10,000 only 317 were residing in the provinces7namely, 275 in those of Bengal, in most of which there is a permanent settlement of the land-tax, and only 42 to be divided among those of Madras and Bombay, where taxation is arbitrary, excessive, and variable,-under the first of these Governments, indeed, often varylng from year to year. The little Crown colony of Ceylon, of 1. 60th art of the area of continental India, and. containing one 1-50th part of Its population, has at present as large a number of Englishmen engaged iu the culture of the single article of coffee (a branch of industry of little snore t.a. 30 years' standing) as continental India has in the culture of sugar, indigo, and siik, The colony of Algiers, which has been possessed by France aboat one-fourth part of the time that we have possessed India, had an European population two years ago of 1a5,600, or above a5 times as many as all British India. Ag to the number of the mixed race in British India springing from the union of Englishmen with natives of the country, no account whatever has ever been rendered, and most probably none exists. As to the converts to Christianity which have been made under the East India Company's withering rule of a century, we suspect that the return must be pretty nearly nil, although the Mahomedans have been tolerably busy during the samie period, and have probably increased their number by two or three millions. Now, had India for the 100 years that it has been under the excluding system of the Conapany been subject to the Government of the Crown, Englishmen would have had free access to it, with power to hold the fee-simple of lands on a certain and safe tenure, as they have everywhere else under the British -ceptre. Under such auspices they and their descendants, whether creole or of mixed blood, along with the converts to the Cross whom they would Inevitably have made, would have been counted not as now, by hundreds or by thousands, but by hundreds of thousands, or evern by millons. All such persons would, by their example or by their teaching, have proved the most effectual missi ,n. aries of their own faith, and from the mere necessities of their position, to whatever sct of Christians belonging, the cheapest and the most effectual support of British pover. That such would assuredly hAve been the result we may learn from what is passing in the present revolt, since we know that it is a principle adopted by the Mahomedan and Hindoo conspirators to exterminate every man, woman, and child, of whatever sect or colour, passing under the name of Christian. Eglishmen ought long ago to have been much too numerous m India for any mutiny or rebellion to .ave speculated upon their extirpation. 'With such a body of settlers as we ought to have had after a hundred years of supremacy, it is impossible to conceive that we should cver be overtaken and surprised by a rebellion raging from the Ganges to the Indus. It is not often that we can gain a lesson of political wisdom from the Spaniards, but the question of settlement and colonization, in so far as concerns their Eastern colonies, certainly affords one exawple. For the 300 years that the Spaniards have been settled in the Philippines, these fine islands have been accessible to every Spaniard, and Spaniards in common with the natives are there landhloldar on very favourable tenures. The Spaniards and their descendants at present amount to 25,000, and these and their forefathers havo converted nearly the whole population, amounting at rnt to 5,000,000; the native Ciristians being so stronly attached to the Spanish Crown that owving to them the lhilippino Islands may be considored as not only secure from intercal insurrection, but impregnable against any foreign invasion, so that they are likely to oontinue a colony of Spain long after Spain has lost the rest.of its foreign dependencies. Even the government of Spai)n, then, almost the worst in Europe, has been wiser than that which -we tolerate, but shall not tolerate much longer, under the name of the East India Company The falso policy, then, which, to a greater or less degree, we have pursued in our government of Ind.a for 100 years may safely be averred to have led to the results for which the nation is now sorrowiing. By systesn.atical v discouragng the settlement of our countrymen in our own conquest we have virtually set our faces against the dissemnination of European civilization, and of the reli--ion of that civilization. By that false policy we have bee;. Ieft friendless in the hour of need, unsupported, ignorant, and surprised by a conspiracy of Brahmins and Mahoinedans which has shaken our dominion to its basis. By reason of 'hat false policy pursued for three-quarters of a century, the comnmerce of the Indies, instead of an advantage, because a seriors detriment to the nation. It is high tixe, then, to repudiate and abandon it. Our quarre,lwe must add, is not with mistaken men, but mistaken principit.s. We do not quarrel with East India directors of the present or any other generation. Blinded by their position, they no donbt believed that what was profitable to themselves was eqlaly beneficial to the public.
