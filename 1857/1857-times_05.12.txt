THE PUBLIC OFFICES. TO TE1 EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-It has been determined to bring together in one place the public office-, which are at present scattered about the town; and, provided the most ordinary care be taken, an important economieal and administrative result will be obtained by the mnere fact of their concentration. But this is not all. Buildings erected on a scale calculated for our public offices could hardly fail to be of imposing grandeur; and, if they were brought into one point of view with other national monuments, cud were combined with national objects of great beauty, an addition would be made to the immaterial wealth of the country which would be an honour and delight to us and to our children and children's children. The part of the subject which first requires attention, therefore, is the block plan, and not the elevation; and the object is to agree upon an outline the details of which may be filled up from time to time as occasion may require in such a manner that each separate element may contribute its ful share towards a general effect. The slightest inspection of the designs now being exhibited in Westminsterhall wi}l show the necessity of early attention to this point. In the great majority of them the Houses of Parliament, upon which so much has been spent, and which ought to form a prominent feature of any plan for laying out our official quarter, are effectually neutralized by a screen of public offices proposed to be erected in front of them. What the outline ought to be is a question upon 'which each person will exercise his own judgment, but the existing arrangement of the district does not appear to allow of much difference of opinion. Between St. James's Park and King-street, and between the parade ground at the Horse Guards and Great George-street, we have a space which is already to some extent occupied by public offices, or by sites prepared for them, and is better adapted for official purposes than any other situation in London. This would give us one face towards St. James's Park and another, which would be the principal face, towards the river. Opposite to this would be the Lambeth bank of the Thames, upon which lofty and handsome buildings would in due time be erected, in connexion with new quays and bridges. At one end would be "Her Majesty's ancient Palace of Westminster," flanked by the bridge, and by the Abbey diaencumbered of St. Margaret's t'hureh, and completed by the addition of a central steeple; and at the other end Whitehall Palace rnight ba completed between the Banquetting-houce and the river, according to Inigo Jones's beautiful design, or an adaptation of it suited to the circumstances of the present time. The result would be a magnificent square, with the river flowing through it, and with St. James's Park extended to the bank of the river on either side of the central block of official buildings,-for the Horse Guards would be absorbed into the War Department, and the Birdcage-walk would be connected with the open space in front of the Abbey. This would be a combination of the beauties of nature and art which would be worthy of our [mperial city. We should then have, in the midst of our most cherished historical associations, a Grand Place, on the principle of the Roman Forum and the Place de La Concorde, sufficiently extensive to allow of successive generations illustrating it by public edifices designed according to many different styles. Another part of the subject which must soon be entered upon is whether Somerset House be not the most convenient situaton for the courts and offices of law, which are at present more scattered o,ver the towAn even than the ordinary civil departments. There can be no doubt that the acount department of the Admiralty ought to be united with the head office at Whitehall, and that the superintending establishments of the different branches of the public revenue should be brought into immediate connexion with the Treasury ; and if this were done Somerset House would be available for any other purpose for which it might be required. But, whether this or another plan be preferred, let us by all means begin by agreeing upon some well-considered scheme, which may be worked up to as the public exigencies require and as funds can be conveniently provided. We should then enter upon our work in the confident assurance that nothing -would be done which we should afterwards wish ndone; that e-very part, asit was completed, would bena step towards a predetermined general effect; and that as no existing buildings wolId be taken down before their removal wa rendered necessary by the progress of the works, no waste or inconvenience uld be occasioned by premature clearings.

PARLIAMENTARY OATHS. TO THZE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-On Thursday next Lord Palmerston is to bring in a Bill to amend the oaths taken by Members of the two Houses of Parliament." It is much to be regretted that his Lordship has not availed himself of the present very favourablo opportanity to bring in a Bill for the entire abolition of the oaths. The reoent wholesale swearings in the two Houses have been, not only annoying and painful to the oathtakers themselves, but offensive to tho moral feelinp and to the common sense of a large portion of the public out of doors. This offenco cannot be removed by any amendment of no oaths. The horrible profanity of oalling the Almighty to witness to a promise which has no meaning may be got rid of by omttting the oath against abetting the Pretender; but most thoughtful persons will continue to be offended whenever there is a repetition of the recent spectacle a general swearin g in of the members of the two Houses. If it were not lamentable it would be simply ridiculous to see all the peers and all the representatives of the people caUed upon over and over again-on an average, once in $hree or four years-to swear that they will not do what no human being has the least idea that any one of them will ever wish to do. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishod of London, the county members, the members for the universities, aU are required to take the oatbs. A man may be a peer, a keeper of the Queen's conscience, one of Her Majesty's most honourable Privy Council, a right reverend Father in God; he may be fresh from the receipt of the suirages of five or six thousand of his neighbours; he may have served his country for a quarter of a century, be honoured, trusted, loved by his fellow.countrymen, but he must not sit and vote in Parliament til he has " taken and subscribed" these oaths. No one supposes that they will have the smallest effect upon his character or conduct. Every one knows that they do not keep out disreputable maembers, or in fact produce any effecot whatever except that i SPhich they were not intended to produce-viz., the excl- sion of the Jems. Now, it is to be presmmed that Lord Palmerston's Bill for the amendmeat of the oaths will amend them in this very ps*ticular; and surely it would be in every way easier and better to sweep them away altogether. They cannot be justified on the same grounds as the judicial oath; they are relics of other and very difterent times-of another and a very different state of public opinion. There was a time when the very existence of the Church. the Crown, and the Constitution was thought to rest on the security of oaths. We know now that our best and only security, under Divine Providence, for the maintenance of our national blessings, must be found in the good sense and good feelings of the people, enlightened by an education liberal and religious, by public discussion, and by a free press. It is time that we should trust more than we have hitherto trusted our fellow-countrymcn, both in Parliament and out of doors. The latter may be trusted to sele4t genera11y their representatives with a good judgment, and the former may be trusted to behave loyally and patriotically without the stimulus of an unnecessary oath. Your obedient servant. HARRY CRESTEP. t3, KuUtand-gate, May 1L

JUDICIAL COMMITTBEofPRIT7Y COUNaCIL, Scaurday, may 9. BE3MER V. FREE:AN AND BREIER. (Before Lord WEISLmYDALE Dr. LUSEMNGTON, and Si2 I .Tnn PAFrvn.- l-ord WENSLEYDALF, in delivering the judgment of their Lordships in this very important case as to the law applicable to the alleged French domicil of a British subject, expressed his regret that Sir W. E. Maule, who was present at the hearing, iwas now absent through indisposition. Sir W. H. Maule, however, fuUy concurred in the judgment Their Lordships, he said, have attentively considered the long and able arguments which were addressed to them by the learned counsel at the bar for several days, and they re now prepared to advise Haer Majesty to reverEe the sen. tence of the Judge of the Prerogative Court. The principles which ought to govern their decision are few .aud clear. The onus of proving that an instrument is the wiU of the alleged testator lies oa the party propounding it. The respondent has undoubtedly established a pjimo facie case by the evidence he has adduced of the due execution of the wilL The ontts proband4i then, lies upor the party impeaching the will, to show that it ought not to be admitted to proof. The appellant alleges that the supposed testatrix was at the time of her death, for that is the material date, domiciled elsewhere than in England. The burden of proof of that fact unquestionably rests upon her. She must establish that the alleged testa. trix had lost her domicil in England; and if it is proved that she abandoned it and gained another elsewhere, and died in that new domicil, the onus probandi is then shifted, and it lies upon the party propounding the will to prove that the law of that domicil was such as to authorize a will in that form. If he fails in that proof the Vwi propounded cannot be admitted to probate. That the law of the tests tor's domicil at the time of making the will, and of the death of the testator when there is no intermediate change of doiliil, must govem the form ane solemnities of the instrument can no longer be questioned. The maxim "mobilia sequuntur erosnam," has long prevailed, and whatever the origin or that doctrine may be, whether it was derived from a fictitious annemation of moveables to the person, or from an enLarged policy growing out of their transitory nature, it has (as Nr. Justice Story observes) so general a sanction among all civilized nations that it may now be treated as a Part of the ius gentium {Story, (oJlict of Zeas, sec. 380). It follows from this maxim that the post-mortuary distribution of the effects of a deceased person must be made according to the law of his domicil at the time of his death, if he dies without a will and it equally seems to follow that if the law of that country allowed him to make a will the will, must be in the form and with the solemnities which that law requiredand it was decided in the cae of "Stanley v. Bernes" (' Eagg., Eccle. Reps., 373), which doctrine we believe has been generally approved (Story, sec. 468). It is not of importanoe to discuss in this case whether a wil valid at the time of making it by the law of the then domicil of the testator would be avoided by his acquiring and having at the timo of death another domicil, according to which it would be invalid, because upon the facts in evidence no change of domidl took place between the time of making the will and the time of death. If the testatrix was domiciled in France in 1853, when she died, the evidence shows that such domicil had commenced in 1842. Whatever question might have arisen if Madame Allegri had died in 1842, her subsequent residence for U years gave a character to her prior residence, and proved that the domicil had oommenced at that time. Nor is it material, for the same reason, to consider the point ured by the Queen's Advocate, that by the 7th of William It., and lat of Victoria, chap. 24, eec. 20, no will can be revoked except by another will or codicil, or by its destrucion, as therein mentioned. Their Lordship)s, however, do not wish to intimate any doubt that the law of the domicil at the time of the death is the governing law (ee Story, sec. 473), nor any that the statute of 7th of Wi]la IV., and 1st of Victoria, applies only to wills of those persons who continue tohave an English domicil, and are conseuently regulated by the English Lar. Two questions, therefore, are to be disposed of in this case:-First, has the appellant proved satisactorDly that the deceased Madame Calcraft, or Al1egri, died domiciled in Italy or in France, where the appellant alleges that she WPws actually then domiciled? Secondly, has the respondent established, to the satisfaction of their Lordships, that by the municipal law of the domicil at the time, of death the wM propounded was valid? We proceed to consider theseQuestions in their order. As upon the first of them their Lord. ships concur with the learned Judge of the Prerogative CourtJ in the conclusion at which he has arrived, it is not necessry to enter into much detail of the facts in proof. The deceased was the daughter of an officer in the East India Company's service, born in the East Indies in 1795. She had, therefore, an Anglo-Indian domicilof orIgn General Calcraft, her father, returned to England wit er and her seter and mother, in 1805. The deceased resided with him as part of his family tiU 1825, and no doubt her domicil then was English. She leftherfatherin 1825 or 1827, and travelled with her governess abroad, and went into Italy. Her father died in 1834, and her sister then joined her, and travelled also in Italy tilu 1838, when both sisters removed to Paris, lived together tiU 14H in furnished lodgings, then in hired apartments in the Boulevard des Capucnes, till the death of the sister in September, 1840. She renewed from time to time, for short terms of years, the lease of those apatmenb, and died in them. without ever having quitted Paris, in September, 1853. While she was in Italy she was said to have been seoretly maried to an Italian named Allegri, and she went by the name of Allegri from 1840 to the time of her death. But therewasnoproof of theaciualmarriage. Itappearsthatat one time she confessed to Mr. Freeman that she was not married, and theirLordships agreewthSirJohnDodson thatthe supposed domicil in Italy, as the country of her husband, is entirely out of the question. The only matter to be considered is whether she acquired a domici in Franoe. There are very strong circumstances in evidence to show that she did. These are her residence in Paris for 15 years, without any business or occupation in that place, and without ever quitting it; her takng her apartments on leases, and furnishing tem herself; her occaional declarations that she would never return to England, and that she wished to be buried near her sister in the cemetery of Pare ia Chais It is of no weight, in oppostion to these facts, that her fortune was princlpally im the English funds and other se;urities here. It is, indeed, trme that her not procurig an authorization from the Government to fix her domicil in France, according to article 13 of the Code Civil, hereafter to be noticed, and perhaps also the fact of making her will in the English form, are some evidence that she did not mean to abandon her English domicil, but they are of little weight, as it is highly probable that she knew nothing of the provisions of the Code CivWl, or of the necessity of making the will in any but the ordinary English form. On the whole, their Lordships entirely concur with the learned judge in his opinon that Madame Allegri was domiciled, according to the law of nations, at Paris, both at the time of her death and the time of making her will, if thatisatall material; and we think it is not. This domicla being eshblished in evidence, the burden is thrown on the respondent to prove that the 'will, in the English form, is sanctioned by the municipal law of France. He must show, upon the balance of the conflicting evidence in the cause, that the wills of persons, so domiciled, in that form are allowed by that law. This is the important question, and the ouly one of any difficulty in the case. Miuch evidence was produced of the law of France on both sides; the viTd Wm testimony of experts in the science and practice of the law, 'ouching and referring to the Code CiviZ decrees, and to known treatises. Some of those last have been since brought forward and referred to without objection on either side, and their Lordships have to decide on the whole of this (for the most part) very unsatisfactory, confused and conflicting evidence, whiether they are convinced that this will executed in France in the English fotm is valid. On the part of the respondents five persons practising in the French courts, stating themselvos to be experienoed in the law oflFrance, were examined; on the part of the appellants three. It iskto be lamented that from the very nature of the case we cannot satisfy ourselves by the personal examinations of those witnesses as to the3 weight due to each of them, and ayproper sense of professional delicacy precludes them from giving evidence as to the merits of each other. We are compelle[, therefore, to decide the disputed question withinadequate means of judging of their professional eminence, their skill, and knowledge. It is to beremarked, speaking with all respect to those gentlemen, that the rule of international law which all English lawyers consider as now firmly established,-namely, that the form and solemnities of the testament must be governed by the law of the domicil of the deceased, does not aper to be recognized, or at least borne in mind by anY Of them. Nay, in Qunartin's case (appellant's case, 19) both the Cour Royale and the Cour de Casation expressly decided that the will must be in the form and with the solemnities of the plce where it is made, on the principle that "locus regit actusn"; an error which is ably exposed in the opinion of M. Target in the Duchebs of liington's cae (ColL. Juridica, 323). The three witnesses called for the appellant, Messrs. Frignet, Senard, and Paillet, all maintain the same doctrine. (Appendix 113, 117, 12C. ) If this position were really true the case of the appellant wrould prevail, but the other witnesses do not maintain the same doctrine. Of the five experts Hlehlert ;(136,_ ,169), Vatismesnil. (17.0), all think that tho wiln, eitner in the form required by the law of the doincil of rigin, or the place where the party dwells, is valid; a rositionwhiich,byE glishlawyers,isocertainlynowceon6idered to be exploded since the case of " Stanley v. Bernes." The whole o these five experts give their opinion that Ifadame Allegri never was domiciled de facto, according to the law cf nations, in France upon the facts stated to the case. In that resct their Lordships have already intimated that they entertain a contrar opinion, and that circumstance, although it is quite consistent with their bein; right in their opinion ofthe law, a little diminish6s the relance to be put upon it. These five witnessesaU say, someles6 decidedly than others, that to gain a legsal domicil in France the aiuthorization of the Emperor was necessary. Some admit tbat there arecontrary dcta and decisions. The other three experts, those examined on behalf of the appellant, give their op on that to acquire a legd domidil, such as will cause the succession to open in France, the Imerial authorization is not ieoessary (Frignet 124, Senard 117, Palltet 121) but most of these experts also admit that it is a dsputed question. This d erenoe between the learned experk8 arises upon the construction of the 13th article of the Code Ivapoleos, upon wbich we can formnsome opinion ourselves, It is to this effect :-" The forei ner who shaU have been admitted by authorization of tbe Emperor to establish his domicil in France shall enjoy there all civil rights, fO long as he shall continue to reside there." It is aid that the rights of testacy and sucesf- sion a-e civil rights, and that a domiciled foreigner cannot enjoy thote rights without this authorization. Pothier, in his treatise De la Communaud. part 1, cap. 1, art. 1, classes the right of testacy and sucesso amoll OYAI nihts which atranger he thou p not donmed, d IOntracts among the "droits dee gens" which strangers IAVe ; andin his Trait6de sTIStaoens, cap. 3,see. 1,art.l, yage 309. he says:-"Le testament appartient au droit civil, d!oa ii suit qu'il n'y a que ceux qui jouis. sent dez droits do citoyens qui puissent tester," and therefore au6bains," or strangers not naturalized, are regu incapable of bequeathing the goods they have in France.* The affirmative provsion that every foreipner who shall be authorized to fix his domicil in France shall have all the civil rights, though it does not explidtly say so, no doubt mens that the foreigner, to enpoy 11, must have that authorization; but it does not follow from that provision alone that he cannot enjoy any one or more of those rights vithout it; he may quite consistently with that article have the power of testacy and the power of leaving his succession to devolve on his family. But assming that the 13th article prohibits the exercise of any civil right to one who is domiciled but has not an authorization from the Emperor, and therefore denies the right of testacy altegether, what is the consequence? Is it that the foregner cannot make any will at all of his rsonal goods, wherever situated, or only of lis personal goods situated in France ? If the former is to be considered as the true construction, then the conseguence is that a stranger, if he elects to domicile himself in, and dies in, France without authorization, loses his power of making a will altogether, and his effects by the law of nations wil not pass under his will, according to the rule already stated. Wbat rights his relatives woulu have is another question. If he should be domicled in a country where, on death, by law all his effects go to the Sovereign by a " droi d'caubaine" more extensive than that of old France, which applied only to personal effects within the kingdom, that law must prevail, and his will would be of no validity, and his relatives, by the law of his domicil of origin, would lose all their rights. In this view of the 13th article this wil cannot be admitted to probate. If -the meaningis, as seems probable (see Herlin ep., Ed. 1812, Etranger. section 11) that he shall have no power, unless so authorized, to make a wil of personal effects situate in France, but he may for those elsewhere, still his will, to havo any effect, must be in the form and with the solemnities of his domidil according to the general rule, otherwise it cannot be admitted to proof, and the property in France would not passby it. So that upon any construction of this article, on the assumption that the power of making a will is one of the civil rights on which it operates, the will in question is not valid. There seems strong ground to contene that the restraint upon the power of testacy and of the right of devolving personal effects upon relatives, is done away with altogether bysubsequent legislationx by the law of the 14th of July, 1819 (pp. 160-151, Appendlx), foreigners are entitled to succeed, and to dispose and receive in the same way as French subjects in all the extent of the kingdom. If a stranger can dispose of his personal property in France or anywhere else by will, -why shouldhe betheless able to do it because he is domiciled in France? Bethat as it may, if the power of testacy is still restrained by the 13th article of the Code Napoleon, and if the only effect of that article is that a foreigner may be legally domiciled, but yet not enjoy the civil right .of making a will, this will ought not to be admitted to proof. But it is then contended on the part of the respondent, that by the law of France no domicil, for any purpose whatever, can be obtained there except by the previous authorization of the Government. The witnesses differ on this point, and it will be proper to take a short review of the decided cases and the principal text authorities cited at the bar on both sides, and it wil be found that they, on the whole, confirm the opinion that a domicil which regulates the succession may be obtained without such authorization. And first let us examine the decided case These decisions are not treated with the same respct, and are not of sO much authority, in France, as the decisions of English Courts are in zDgand. By one gentleman thereis said to be an adage that "the decrees are good for those who obtain them" (Marie, p. 131, Appendix), and it is said that considerations ot equity prevail too often in the decisions of the French Courts, and that they often vary (id. p. 134, Appendix). But we must consider these decisions, ronounced by sworn judges, under their judicial responsiEility, as of more weight than the opinions of advocate witnesses, or even than some text writers. Of these decisions part are inapplicable, as they relate, not to testacy or succession, but to civil rights, clearly such, which strangers, and even domiciled strangers, are not entitled to, unless they have the required authorization (such as the right to be free from personal arrest D'Abaunza's case (Appellant's case 50), the case of the 'rincess Poniatowska 141, Appendix), and in Siray, 1811, fol. 455, Dreumler's p. 141, Appendix); some relate to rights of action in French court- (see cases of Rowland and Son, Kirkby and others, p. 142, Appendix) to which the mere domicil can give no right unless the authorization of Government be added; others, pat of the cases cited, relato to contracts which belong to the droil des pens, which are impliedly governed by the law of the place of residence, independently of domidil, such as Lloyd's case (41, Appellants case), Breul's case (ib. 26), where domiciled foreigners were held bound by an implied contract to have a cornmunauM des bien, upon the principle that the contracts of residents are impliedly made according to the usage of the place where they reside. The case of Herwas is upon a question of contract (p. 55, Appellant's case.) None of these cases have any bearing on the present. Those which have are cases where the succssion is held to be regulated by the domicil of the deceased, though such domicil was unauthorized by the Government. The first is Gil d'Olivarez (appellant's case 30), in which it was opressly decided, in 1S, by the civil tribunal of Bordeaux, that a foreigner may acquire a daii. dle, without the authorization of the Gvovernment, so as to regulate the suocession; that the question of domic belongs to the law of nations, and the succession is regulated by It; and that the 13th article of the Code Napoleon did not apply to such a cae. There was an appeal to the Cour Impdriale, who expressly deoided the same way, and that the 13th article, requiring the Emperor's authorization, applied only to the acqudsition of civil rights, and did not prevent tha acquisiton of a domicil by a foreigner, so as. to regulate his succession. The only observation to be made against the authority of this case is that the parties consented to the Court winding up the account, and that the personalty should be governed by tho law of domiciL which the Court observed is the consequence of a principle generally inculcated by almost every author and admitted in law. We do not think that this consent weakens the authority of that decree. In this decision the previous authority of a decision at Riom in 1835 is citeda It was Onslow's case (p. 37, Appellnt's case). Onslow, the deceased, had established himse1f in France before April 7, 1790, and before the promulgation of the Code Napoleon) and was entitled to the exercise of civil rights by virtue of that law, and therefore the 13th Artide did not deprive him of them; but the Court expressly decided that he miBht be domiciled notwithstanding the 13th Article, and that the authorization of Government was not neoessaryr to a domicil which regulated the law of succession. The next case cited was that of the Baron do Mecklembourg, July, 1856 (p. 45, Appellant's case). The Court of First Instance at Pans determined that, though he had never had the authoriza, tion of the Government to enjoy civil rights, yet the legal enjoyment ef those rights was independent of domicile, an the deceased being domiciled4at Paris, his successionopened there. The Imperial Court reversed this judgment, on the ground that the decesased had never abandoned his domicil of origin, and that all his heirs were forigners; and the Court appears to have.mentioned the want of an application for an authorization to establish his domicil in Fance, as evidence that he never meant to acquire one there, no more. It does not say that the want of authorization at once put an end to the right of domiciL In Lynch's case (Sirey, 1851, 2, 791), the fact of Lynch not being domiciled in Franoe at the time of his death, but in Ireland, is the ground of the decision. Whether the fact of his not having ever obtained authority to establish his domicil is used as evidence of having no intentionto acquire one, or that he had no domicil for the want of it, is difficult to decide. The case cannot, at all events, be considered as contrary to that of Olivarez. The case of Connolly wasalso cited; It occurred in 1853. It is reported by the name of " De Veyne v. Routledge" in "' Sirey's Reports," 1852, and has been referred to on both sides at the;bar. It involves other points besides that of the validity of the wilL 3Madame de Vene, a natural daughter of the testator, cited the legatees before the civil tribunal of Fontainebleau, to set aide the will, as being void according to the law of France, and to have her share of the snccession. That tribunal docided that Madame do Veyne had not established her case as a legitimate daughter, and that the testator having an English domicil, the wull was valid. On appeal the superior Courtl reversed .this decision. It seems thAt the Court held that the testator was domiciled in Franoe (though it is never stated that he obtained the authorization of the Emperor); that his succession opened there; that his natural daughter was legally recognized by him, and, being a Frenchwoman by marnage, had a right to claim a part of the succession; and the will being invalid by the French law, not being in the proper form, Madame do Veyne was entitled to recover in her suit. The Court add (incorrectly, as has been said before), that the form of the wvill must be reguted hby the law of the place where it in made. Upon a review o' these decisions upon the material question inthis case, the effect of GomicR by tne law of nations upon the law of succesaion, it is cleat that the geat weight of authority is in favour of the position, that the authorization of the Emperor is not necessary in order to establish a domicile for the purpose There is no one decision that it is necessary, for it is by no means clear that Lynch's case so decides, and the case of Olivarez and the princples laid down in the others clearly support the opposite doctrine. It remains for their Lordships to observe on the text-writers referred to on both sides. The authority of Merlin has been cited on the interpretation of Article Xm. of the Code Civil. It was referred to in the Cases of the Princess Poniatoweka, as laying down the proposition that no domicU could be acquired without the anthorzation of Government (Sirey, 1811, p. 653), (Merlin, "Rep. Domicile," ed. 1824, s. 13, pp. 16, 17). Repertoire, ed. 1812; Etranger, a. 11, ed. 1824; Art. Etranger. s. I, No. 6, p. 531; where he lays down that ploposition, against the proposition of ML Proudhon. In the edition of 1830 this article has been re-written, aud a perfectlydifferent vlew of the law taken. The question hlerlin considers in whether authorization is necensaryto gain a domicil He says it was universally allowed to be unnecessary before the Code CiviL He diouasgts the question for what purposes it was rendered nece. yarz by the Code. Certainly, lhe sAys, to enjoy the civil rights reserved to Frenchmoen. He could not sue other strangers, not domiciled, upon contracts made with them in France or abroad, for. he could not claim any privilege of exemption from the rule "adio sequiturfor r'eiv" It is not required to render him liable to be sued in his domicil in Franee. It Is not required in the computation of 10 years, rendered necessary to obtainnaturalization. He concludes that the codo has not changed the nature of * 21. !aque deso Ctrmiagem quotque non natuidi mals domici1Sti en France. sous une eontumne qut admet la communautd des bezns, NM qu'il soit besoin de la stipuler. y conotdeot mseW MSS 1Beerauc untntrat de mahage, is commun uto Ifale a lleu eutre ceM renrso0ner I. est ai que ces peCnounes no sont Ps eaabls du droll civIl. qol ns etE drabli que poarh le dtuaen, td q7uo la dot des testamenool, deXs sooeao(lao do wenat ligosser; mat elles sont e p: bksdeceqloaoutentau di' Stdesgeos, tollee quo soot -outosls conventions or umeoonuaut6 16gale o'.st foudee que sur onle e rentSon qne lea 000°l 0 nquionmtrscteotb sialao Oo PrbiesOO tdI T diSe I'htbllt doleaquel conenteilon 1de Enteioquo dotout.laoet the domicil at a1L He refers to the avis of the Counil d'Etat of the 18Prairial, a xL, which was, thatiin every case where a stranger wishes to establish himself in France he is in all cases bound to obtain th!e permission of the Govern. ment, and that these permissions being, according to ir. cumstances, subjeut to modifications, and even revocatio.. cannot be determined by general rules. Merlin says, that this opinion was given in answer to a question to the Coosell d'Etat, whetherthe authorization bythe13tharticle giving the foreigner the iPower to acquire all civil rights, alEo give. the power of obtaming by article 3 of the Acte Con. stitutionnel 22 ;Fraie, *an. viL, the rights of a French citizen, andhesays theanswer istobe underatood according to thesuhect-matter, namely-the question put to themandthat the expression " en tous ca" refers to the cames the subject of the inquiry. And besides, he says that this opinion was never inserted in the Bulletin of Laws, and did not bind the courts of justice, and was merely meant to govern the conduct of the Minister of the Interior with respect to foreigners who, having lived ten years in France, wished to be recognised as citizens; and he concludcs by stating it as his opinion that a foreigner wbo:establishekbis domicil inErance withoutthe permission of the Government submits himself by that act alone to the jurisdiction of the French tribunals, acquiring by that act alone the power to marry in the placo which he chooses for his habitual residence, and determines by that act alone the comp,etence of the judge who, after his death, takes cognizance of his succession tbat he leaves in France. This latest opion of Merlin seems to be fully warranted by the reasons he gives and to be perfectly satisactory. The sttement of r tgat, 'ode des B.rang.e4, pp. 287, 288, founded on the construction of the same arrMZ of the Council d'Etat, that a stranger, unless authorized, cannot have a domicil aper not to be maintainable; nor the same sttement by e Angat, Blat orc de la Condit"o Ci vile des .Etrangers en France, p. 369. A passage was referred to in Zacharise, Cours de Dr-oit Oiv8, purt. L, chap. 4, p. 28D, "that the establishment by a strtnger of his domicil in France, with tne authorization of the Government, has the effect of aubmitting his succession, mobilire to the apdl Cation of the French law." Of that there is no doubt, but it does not follow that it is not true, if he is domiciled without it. In the same treatise (p. 278), referring to a prior note (262), it is said that a stranger requirs the same authorization to establish his domicil in France as to enjoy civil rights.Hestatesthatthiao inioniscorzoboratedbythe avis of the Conseil d'Etat, 20 Prsirial, an. xi., uinporting that in every case where a stranger wishe3 to esta- lish himself in Franoe he isbound to obtain the authorLna. tion of Government. The satisfactory explanation given by erlin, above referred to, does awa with the authority of that opinion of the Council of Shte, and shows that no reliance can be placed on this opinion of Zachari^. Troplong in his Commentary (Sur la Contrainte par Corpe, fect 596), inquires who is a stranger domiciled in France, and says that the 13th article of the code gives the answer,-" He who has received the anu thorization of thKigofxhs domicil there and by that right enjoys civil nghts. Heisapeaingof the liability to arrest, contrainte par corTs, and of that there is no question; it has no bearing on this case. On the whole the a review of all this evidence of the laLw of France their Lordahipe are clearly of opinion that it is not eatalliabed that for the purpose of having a domicil which would regulate the succession, any authorization of the Emperor was neceessay; that a legal domicil for thin purpose was clearly proved, and that consequently, if the testatrix had a powe to make a will at all, the will in this form wa invali There are stil two English cases to be noticed Th respondent relies on' Coler v. Rivas," (2 Cres 5) in which. Sir Herbert Jenner Fist decided t othe evidence before him, an Englishman aomiciled in Belgium by the law of nations, but not authorized by the aovernment, according to the 13th article of the Civil Code of France, in force there, might make a wliU in the English forn. The case was not regulazly contested, which makes it of less authority. It was a mere question on the parole evidence of the Belgian law, which was very short andl unstisfactory. Their Lordships have referred to the depositions, and doubt whether the leamned judge was waranted by the evidence contained in them in Coming to the conclusion which he did. In this case the evidence on both sides is very full, and leads to a different conclusion. On the other hand, there may be cited for the appellant the case of " Anderson T. Ianeuvihe," (9 Moore, P. C. Cases 225), when the Judicial Committee decided that a domicil was aequired in France, though the de. ceased had not complied with the 13th section of the Code Napoleon, and that objection was distinctly taken (p. 336). Tbat point, however, does not appear to havo been much considered. Their Lordshipsare of opinion that the judg ment of the learned Judge of the Prerogative Court was unsupported by the evidence, and will advise Her Majesty to reverse it, and recall the probate.

(Wh'TRAL A4MRICA. TO TEZ EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Taking your leader of this day as a fair and impartial exposition of the true opinion of this country as to our proper relations with the United States, the following important news by the Arabia, as given in the New York Herald of the 27th ult., requires some explanation:- " Our correspondent in Belize, Honduras, writing on the 1st inst., sends us some very impotnt news from Central America hich will be fo.u7 in his letter, published elsewhere. Mr. Stevenson the British supenntendent at Belize, had left a few days 1)reviously. Mr. Seymour, his successor in officm, landed from the British brig of war Arab on the 30thult., and the next day he was sworn into office with much ceremony. On the folowing day the Arab took him down to Ruatan, where he was sworn in, in the name of Queen Victoria, as ' Her Majesty's I eutenantGovernor of the Bay Islands.' This fact caused much eXcxitement, as it was believed that England had no real intention of ceding the colony to Hondura. It i indeed, a very cuious fact, when we takce into consideration the recently declared policy of Lord Cbrendon,as detailed in our London letter, given in another column, and also the retrocession of the Bay Islands to Honduras by the treaty concluded last winter." You are aware of what has not yet become gene. rally know)o the public-viz., that the delay of sin months within which the Dallas-Clarendon treaty was to be ratified expired on the 16th ult., and that on that day the trety, as amended by the Senate of the United States, was returned to Mr. Dallas, rejected. It will be remembered that last snmmer we negotiated a treaty oeeding the Bay Ilands to Honduras with Senor Herrab, the Minister of that Republic. In the proposed Dallas-Clarendon treaty the negotiation with Honduras was recited, and the United StateswAs asked to carry out a simil arrangement with Honduras, and to join us in obtaining the assent of the other four Repubics of Central America to the plan. We inserted in our agreement with Honduras a clause about the existence of slavery in the Bay Llands. Our right to inslst on this claiuse was questionable, seeing that the fact of our cession to Honduras was yielding, in reality, to the allegatio, that we had wrongfully seized those islands. The policy of the clause was, I do not besitate to say, bad, even in the anti-slavery point of view. The Senate of the United States, the treaty-making Power, objected to the slavery clause, and omitted it. They do not seem to have been aware that Honduras had never ratified the treaty with us, and that it was therefore mere waste paper. So far it is quite apparent that Lord Clarendon was, in a diplomatic sense, in the right. But it now appears that on the-Slst of March we actually put a governor In possession at Ruatan, although we did not nform Mr. Dallas that Honduras had mever ratified our cession to ber until the 16th of ApriL IF this be true, and I fear it is, we have to boast of " one of the most tarnation 'cute pieces of sharp practice" ever heard of. I hope that some member of the House of Commons may ask Lord Palmerston whetber we can claim to be " a little the smartest people in creation." I am. Sir. Your obedient servAnt. VOYAGEUIP
sT. JoH's FOUNDATION ScHooL.-The anniverFsry festival of the St. Jobn's Foundation SchooL forthe free education and support of the children of that uwhappily zunmerous body " the poor clergy" of theChurch of Englanda was celebrated yesterday evening at the London Tavern, Bis Grace the Duke of A1ll, K,T., occupied the presidential chair, supported by the Right Hon. the Jod or yor, the Rev. Dr. Moore, and other gentlemen. The noble Chairman proposed the toast of the evening in a 1,Dg andelaboratespeech, bearing, amongotherinterestinr points, on the miserable provision made for the maijority of the clergy of the Established Church, especially as conrasted with the liberal and Toluntary support afforded to Dsenting rministers by the members of tbeir respective congregations. It appears from the report that the charity Jt present supports some 23 to 25 children of clergymen, anthie ommiette mow appeal to the public-not for coutributions to free them from out8bnding debta (of which there are none), but for funds to enable them to Cary out the beneficent objects of the society, by doubling the numTber of pupils (the sons of clergymen) admitted to a participa. tion in its benefits; -or, in other words, by enabling them to increase thernumber of pupls from 25 to 0.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGEPN. I ROUSE OF LORDS, MONDAY, MAy 1I. The LonD CIHAYCEOR took his sat on the woolsack at 5 o'clocke TLord Dz Fnnyz= took tho oaths. A pettion was presented by the Earl of CoBK from the mayor and corporation of the city of Cork, praying for the Abolitionof Ministersf Money. CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION. I lFORTESCUE presented apetition from the Customs: eof5cers at D.Ltmouth in favour of analterationandamendment of the Superannuation Act. The Eal of ALBEMARLE presented a petition to the same effect from the civil servants of tho Crown in the Coast. guard department at the port of Southsmpton. The noble earl exaressed his concurrence in the prayer of the potition, and na rated the history of the superannuation ffiud. In 1812, he said, the officers of Customs and Excise had a superannutionfund teoa oonsiderable amount. TheGovern. nent of that day quietly abtracted the fund from the civil servants, and gave them in exchange an Act of Parliament, stipulating that they should not be required to contribute towards a superannuation Lfnd. Faith wae kept till 1822, when, in direct violation of the Act, tho Government procured atax to be levied on the officers of Excise and Customs. In 1824 that tax was repealed, and Parliament reafrmed the principle laid down in the act of 1812. The cupidity of the Government was apin attracted by tho superannuation fund in 1828, and in that yar a bM was introduoed to reimpose tho tax; but Parliament would have nothing to say to it, the Bill was withdrawn, and the Governmentthen attempted by a Treasury minute to supersede law. In 13 was passed the Act of which the civil servants now -with so much justico complained. One of the chief ol4ections to it was that it was partia and unequal izLi operation. For example, some of the persons con. nected with the Treaury were compelled to pay the tax, while others were entirely exempt. The high potical, diplomatic, and judicial functionares did not contribute a single farthing to the fumd. He hoped the grievance of the civil ervants would be speedily reresed, otherwise both Go,vernment and Parliament would expose themselves to theame .odious imputation whichin oldtimes was catupen the noblity and clergy-vim, that of exempting themselves and taxingonly.theirplebeian oountrymen. The annual tx smounted to 66,0001 The sxm paid out was 1L0Q00., no portion of the remainder going into the pockets of the civil servants. Sinoc the tax had been levied the total contributiois amounted to 900.O0 Of that sum the Govern. ment ad paid away 82,0001., leaving a balance due to the civil servants of 8153,000 Only one-sixth paer of the civil servants derived any benefit from the fund, and many casee might be stated showing the injustice of the tax. Some time ago a landig-waiter died at Southampton before he bad attained the ago of 60. His contributions to the fond amounted to 200L, and yet neither his widow nor any other memberof his famyzreceivedone sixpence. Accordingto the statement of an experienced actuary, if tho deceased had laid out Ithe sme money on a policy he would have left 30. for hi famuily. In February lst year tho Government introduoed a Bill into the House of Commons which improved the superannuation system,but; retainedtltotax. Durnmgthe progress of their Bill the 3overnment were met by a petition, and both petition and Bill were referred to a committee which strongly condemned in its report the superannuation impoL A.new Bill was brought in, but it was ten times worse than the first. The report laid beforo the other House abundantly proved that the superannuation pensions had been constantly subjeted to revision-five or six times within the last few years; but Sir Charles Trvelyan, Mr. Bromley, and Mr. Stevenson, the persons employed in the revisions, declared that they never contemplated the ine uslities so much and so jUstly complained of in the tax. Thie noble earl, in conclusion, trasted that their lordships would give the petition their most favourable consideration. The Earl of EGLLwouq and other noble lords presented petitionsto the same effect. THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE, The Mfarquis of BREADALBAE, TLord Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household, said, he had to inform their lordships that the A ddress in answrer to Her Majdesty's gracious Speech was duly presented and was very graciously received, and it pleased Her Majesty to return the following "I thank you for your loyal and dutiful Address, and for your assuranoe that you wdll take into your earliest consideration the measures which wiMl be proposed. Younmay rely on my hearty desire to oo-operate in promoting the welfaie and happiness of my subjects." Her Maoesty's reply was ordered to be entered on the journas of the House. THE SALE OF POISONS AND INDECENT PUBLICATIONS. Lord CAMPBELL wished to call the attention of the House to the necessity of further regulations with respect to the sle of poisons. He knew that the Secretary of State for the Home Department had been actively employed for some time past in obtaining information upon the subject, and he believedathe right hon. gentleman had collected a great deal of very valuable information upon which -ome measure might be introduced. Legidation ought to be directed, not only against the adminitration of poison by deodgn, which had reoeived a salutary check, but against the admiitration of poisonbyacoident. Some precautions were absolutely necessy to prevent the recurrence of case ot poing by miske. Bat he was horry to say there was now carriedon saleof poison furmorefatalthanprusaic acid or strychnine, he meant indecent publications. If there were any difriculty in obtaining them, from their high price, it mnight be of less importanoe, bah it was proved before him, in a trial on Saturday, that there were periodical publications of the most licentious, obscene, and disting descriptious coming out week by week and sold publicly at the price of a penny. He thought it was the duty of the Govemment to take the ncessary measures for immediately puttinga stop to those publications. (Hear.) The LORD CHANCELLOR said, hewnasnotaware of the trial to which the noble and learned lord had referred, as he had not read the papers of the day, but the law, at present, without new legislation, was quite sufficient to put down the sale and punish the sellers of indecent pulbUcations. If there were publications of a depraved character, as described by the noble lord, the Attorney-General would, no doubt, bring in aid the strong arm of the law to suppress them. With referencoe to the sale of poisons, the subject had received the careful oonsideration of the Government, and aBill wouldabe introduced in a few days bythe Secre. tazy of.State for the H[ome Department. The sabject s beset with difficulties. When a dozen poisons were enumerated the ingenuity of chymists discovered as many more, and it was almost impossible to define the limits of medicines sau poisons. It was intended to take precautions both against wilful and aoddental poisoning, and, if the Bill did not wholly remove, it would materially mitigate the evils of which complaint was made. (Hear.) CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION. The Marquis of CLANRICARIDE presented petitions from officers of Devonport Dockyard and from officers of the Galway Custom-house, complaining of the system under which the superannuation allowanoes of the civil' service are at present provided, prefatory to asking the Government whether they contemplated an early change of the sytem. The system upon which the allowances of those persons was regulated was the most unfair, unjust, and unwise that could oe well imagined. It was a system which led to improvidenoe; indeed, he might say iet was one which in some cases almost compelled improvidence. The State, he contended, had received a sum totally out of proportion to the money which the civil servants had contributed. He submitted that the intention of the Act of 1834 wa, not to make money by taxing a oertain class of the public offic3rs, but to provide a fund, after the system of insurance offlces, by which superannuation allowances should be paid to those who contributed to them. (Har, hear.) It was found on caloulation that only one in six, or one in seven, of those who contributed the money lsdreally derived anyadvantag from it. That, he submitted, was of itelfa sufficient rson for inquiry into the subject. Surely, if a man was' to be taxod to provide a fund for his benefit, he or his family, after a certain length of servioe on his part, oughttohaveacertain amount of advantage from thatservice and that taxation. Bat it was known that there were men who had contributed to the fund in question and who had afterwards at death to be buried at the expense of their widows, and in some csese of the parish. (Hear, hear.) He thought the more their lordshipe haa regard to the present system, which had ariseut partly from impeifections inthe: existing legislation, and more from inattention to the subjeet, the more they would find it deserving of their attention, Earl GRANVILL said, there could be no deubt that the subjedc.t in question was one of great importance, affecting as it didhe interests of a most important body of men in HIer Mjesty's service; but their lordihips might recollect that it wstaken into consideration last autumn by a commisson of their lord6hipa' House. and he believed the repors or that commi6sion would be presented within a eek from the present time. Of course, it ;was not the intention of the Government to act in the subject until they had received that report, and had had an opportunity of considering it. TESTAMENYTY JTURISDICTION, A1ND THE LAW OF DIVORCE. The LORD CFrANcELLOR said, he had to lay on the table, for a first reading, a Bill relating to Probites and Letters of Administration, which was substantially the same as the one he introduced last session, but contained a few alterations which were suggested to him when that Bil was under discusion. He had also to lay on the table a Bill relating to MArriages and Divorce. Lord CAMPBELL said, if the Probate and Letters of Administration Bill of his noble and learnod friend was as objectionable in some of its parts as the Bill of last session he should feel it his duty to oppose it. So likewise would be oppose the clause in the Divorce Bill which in the Bill of last session empowered a husband and wife to separate at any time on a mutual agreement to that effect, in the event of such a clause being reproduced in the present The LORD CHANCELLOR said, the Bills were sub. stantially the same as those of last session, but with severa amendmients; and among others, in regard to Ithe Testamentary Bill, he had-more, he miust eon' fes, in deference to the wishes of others than of his lon-entirely separated the Court of Probat in I eeryway nt oly ro th Cortof Chancery but' from every judge of theCourt Oof Chancery.

NEWFOUNDLAND FISERIES. Sir J. PAXINGTON resented a petition from Newrfoundland complaining of the propoied convention with France relative to the Newfoundland fisheries. The petitioners tated that they had embarked lI&e capital in theft fisherie, and that they had heard with consternation of e propoed convention,which would most serioudsy in ere ith their interet. They therefore prayed the House not to saction sid convention, whieh would ental great lows and distrees on Her Majest's subject in New. foundland. X&YNOOTH GRANT. Mr. SCHOLEIELD gave notice that when the hon. mnember for North WarwickaLire brought forward- his motion for withdrawing U aynooth Grant he would move as an amendment She addition of the followung words :-- And to consider the expedienoy of withholding all further grants of public money for religious purpose in Ireland.' (Hear, hear.) CONSUMPTION OF SMOKl Mr. 3BOWYER aked the Secretary for the Home Depat. ment whether the Government would take measures to enforce the law that required manufacturers in London to consume their own smoke. ESir G. GREY replSed that during the last six months there had been 54 convictions in London for violations of the law (hear, hea), but these convictions by no means represented the whole of the steps taken by the authorities, because when the polioe found that parties were dispOsed to make the alterations which the Act required they ablined from taking further measures, so that much more was done in the way of enforcing the arw than appeared from tbe number of convictions. (Hear, hear.) I 1EE) FACTORY. On the motion of Mr. SPoosm there was ordered an account of the total sum expended at Enfield factory from the 1st of .lanuary, 184, to the 31st of March, 1857 ; the amounts under the following heads to be separately sped. fied-viz., building, machinery, miscellaneous storeo, A- ries, and wages. POLWBAD POORLIAW BOAXD. Mr. WISE Asked the President of the Poor-lw Board whether it was the intention of Her MajetWs Govenment to introduce any mewares to revise the laws relatng to the settlement and removalof thepo,orto alter the resent miode of Taizing the ratesfor the selief of the poor by. di. tributing the charge over a widerand lea variable bAsis, or otherwie; seconly, if Her Majesty's Government was not prepared to propose early legiation on these subjects, whether the President of the Poor-lAw Board would asset to the appooitment oe a noymittease reltive to the pract tical operetion of the laws for the relief of the pporen England and Wales, and to consider the policy and general effect of all the laws relating to settlement, removal, ad parochia lassessment. Mr. BOUVERE said it wras not the intention of the Governmnent to introduce any measure relative to the settlement and remloval of the poor dormn the present session. With referenoe to the appointment or a committee, which formed the second question of the hon. gentleman, he should like to hear on what grounds such a committee was recommended before he expressed an opinion. (Hear.) His hoc. friend was aware that extensive and frequent innuries had been made into this question. A few ears ago tbe subject of removal was very minutely inquired into, and the cme as regarded the Irish and Scotch poor was aiso inversigated with great care and minuteness. (Hear, hear.) LUNATIC ASYLUMS (SCOTLAND). In answerto MIr. E EmacEn, Sir G. GREY stated that the report of the commis. sioners appointed to inquire into the ste of lunatics l in Scotland would be printed in the course of a few days. PLACES OF ENETAINMENT. In answer to Mfr. BR&DY, Sir G. GREY said it was not his intention to introduoe any measure for the better regulation of places of public entertainment which are open after 12 o'clock at night.- FINANCE ACCOUNTS. Sir HA WILLOUGHBY asked the Secretary to the Treasury when the finanoe accounts of the year ending the 31st of March, 1857, would be presented. Mr. WILSON said the fimnce accounts ought by law to be presented by the 38th of June, and he believed they wonld be presented before that date. There were, howevers several acounts which could be prodnoed earlier if the bebanet or any other member desired to have them. THE NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERIES. Sir J. PAXINGTON said he had latey seen wa satement in the papers, to the effect that, in deferenoe to the strong objectionenterined by the colonial Legiature of ewafoundland, Her Majesty's Government did not intend to proceed further with the proposed oonvention between this co.nutry and France. Hewished to ask the Colonial Seeretary whether that statement wAas correct, rand also, iE it were, what course the Government intended to pursue, ant whether they had made any communication to the French Government on the subject?n Mr. LABOUICHE E sald he was much obliged to the right hon. baronet for having asked this question, as he had zeason to believo that there was great misapprebension in the public mind with regard to rhat had taken place in this matter. Many very oomplicated and embrassingquestionshad arisenbetween the twoGovernments of ES-noe and Englandasto the NewfoundlAnd fisheries, arisiDgontof various treaties under which Frce posessdcertain rights. The two Governinexitshad for everal years attempted to Fettle these questions by negotiation, and Her Kajestyx Government had benin frequent coDmmunication with th Government of the o0ity on the subject, but a successful Fl lution had never Meen effected. At last, Her Maijets Government, having all the fact before them, had endes voured to arrive at a settlement by concluding a convention with France without previous communication with the colony, insezrting, however, a proviso in the oonvention tbht it should not take effect unlep it should be subsequently approvedoby the colony. Unfortunately, on the convention being sent over, thecolony refused to approve it, and ithba falletitothe ground. No aoubt there hadbeen some excitemenhtin the colony at i firstarisig from a is - sprehension that it was intended to override the deliberabt opinion of thw colonialLeilature bythe ionof theInperilPArliament; but there never had been any intention of the kind, and he washappytosaytbatthat miapprehension hadbeen entirely remove. Tte Executive Council of the oolony had expressed ibeir entire satisfaction at the course pursued by Her Majesty's Government, and at the se enterbned by the Govermuent of the constitutional rights of the oolony. In regard to the fqture, of course Her MajesWys Government would have their attention contantly directed to this matter, aid would tak-e advantage of every opening whiach preteachanoe of bringing these embariassinr queuons to a settlement, but be never wouIa be a paty ;t comproming a rights possessed by the 'colony withot the fllassent and approbation of the community itself. It was the intention of the Government to ly papers on the table which would show more in detil the course which these transactions had taken. CRURCH-RATE5, Sir I, TRELAWNY askd whether the Government had any intention of bringing in a mea6ure for the abolition of church-rates this session? Lord PAIMERSTON.-I can only repeat now the stte. maent which I made on this subject on a former oocsion, and that is, that HEr MjeW s Govermnent have this matter under their oonsideration, and that we are not without hope of being able iin the present sesion to introduce a moasure which may atis all the parin eonoerned. I cannot, however, at presat give a definitive anwer on the subject. Sir J, TREL&WNY said hat unless he could get a 1mor atfacitory and definite uaswer frm the Woble lordaii would be his dutytb bring the subject before the Rouse h the course of the next month. SUPPLY.

ZLONDO2A? TUESDA Y, MXAY 32, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, TheMarquis of BREADARAsNE informed the House of HER MAjrY'S gracious reply to their Lordshipa' loyal address. Lord CAmPBmLL called the attention of the LORD CHACeLLoR to the necessity of further regulations for the sale of poisons. He also wished to mention the diffusion of another poison, far more fatal than strychnine or prussio acid,-ho meant those cheap licentiou3 publications with which the town was flooded. Re thought it was the duty of the Government to take immediate steps to suppreBs this growing evil. The LORD CQAcxLon said, that the legislative enactments already existing were quite suZicient to put these nuisances down. With regard to the alo of poisons, the subject was receiving the attention of the Government. The LORD CHarlcnwn laid onthe table the To. tamentary aud Divorce Bills, which were substan. tially the same as those proposed lat ession. In reply to Lord CAmPBELTL, who said that if the Testamentary Bill were identical with that proposed lut seion he ahould oppose it, The LORD CHANCELLOR stated that the new Court of Probate would be entirely separated from the Court of Chancery and Chancery Judges. The Bills were then read a frt time, sad Ordered to be read a second time that day week. Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of CommonJ, in reply to Sir J. PAXrIGTON`, Mr. Lanouonnan explained the circumstances under which the convention relating to the New. foundland fisheries had been concludedwith France, and had become inoperative owing to the refusal of the colony to sanction it. The House haviug resolved itself into a committee on Savings-banks, The CHACoELLOR of the ExcmmQU1, in moving a resolution, " that it is expedient to amend the laws relating to savings-banlk, and -to provide for the establishment of savings-banks with the scwurity of the Government," stated the principal points of difference between the Bill which he meant to found upon the resolation and the Bill of last seuion. He proposed, he said, by the present Bill that the Government should asunme the entire respondbility for the moneys of the depositors in the bauks, and this obligation rendered it necessry that ample securities should be taken against fraud. He was ready to remove aDy unneceary restrictions, but he trusted that the House would support him in guarding the public interests. If the local authori-- ties, the trustees and managers of savings-banks, opposed these necesmary securities, there wouald be onIy one course-namely, to abandon the Bill, and to leave the system as it was. He intended likewise to introduee a clause into the Bill prohibiting any private individual or company from establihing a bank under the title of a " savings-banl." Sir H. WVLTOuGney stated at some length his objections to what he considered the mischievous praoc tice of allowing the CHANCELLOR of the ExoQuzp to use the stock of the savings-banks for the purposes of the State in carrying on operations of finance. He maintained that the law gave the CnHAycELLoi of the ExcuQuan no right to touch one farthing of this money. He suggested a consolidation of the law, and that the subject should be submitted to a select committee. Mr. H. HznBERT hoped the Government Would not abandon that part of the proposed Bill which provided securities against fraud. Mr. EsTcoUnrTapproved the general scheme of the proposed Bill, except that part which removed the existing restriction upon the amount of deposits to 1001. Lord hDicu joined with Sir H. WiLOwuGHBY in1urging t'e CHa2s in of the ExonlQM to referthesubject, respecting which he proposed to lepslate upona new principle, to a select committee, waere the wrhole lawr might be considered and consolidated. Mr. T. BmNnG said he did not think the managers of savings-banks would object to well defined checks contaned in the Bill; but they would feel a repugnanoe to a discretionary Power being lodged m the hands of the National Debt Commissoner. a Mr. SLANsv spoke in commendation of the proponed memaure. Mr. HENLEY thought that tbe regulations and conditions to which the banks were to be subjected should be laid upon the table and dincused. He thought, too, that the matter suggesed by Sir H. WnouoGBY, the dealing with savings-b ' stock, ws worthy of the consideration of the HEouse Mr. CRossy wished the Bill to be referred to a select committee. He was of opinion that the money of depositors was not made the most of. Mr. FaGAN spoke in favour of the Bill. The CnAwcrntox of the ExcnEqxuz, in replying to objections, observed that the only condition which the Government would insist upon Was to be satisfied of the solvency of the banks, and he wolcld put the teuns in as distinct a form as he could in the Bil. To refer the Billto a select committee, hei said, wrould be to shelve it forthe sesion. The objection urged by Sir H. Wmsouonsy to the power exQeried br the Goverunment of converting the stock of savinsbanks -was not a valid one. The power was not improperly used, and if Parlament imposed a total resriction the public interests would not be benefited thereby. The resolution was then agreed to. Sir G. GaY, in moving the second reading of the Transportation and Penal Servitude Bill, explained its main provisions. It proposed, he said, to abolish the sentence of transportation, and to substitute that of penal servitude for a more extended period, so that convicts might be sent to any colony willing to receive and which possessed means of employing them. He anticipated the objection that if some convicts sentenced to penal srvitude were selected tobe sent abroad while others Were retained at home, it would produce uncertainty in the nature of the punishment, observing that uncertainty had entered quite as much into the former sytem of transportation. The Bill would not alter the power of granting tickets of leave, as a general rule. M£r. BxnrcK believed that convict labour,which wax now wasted, might, by means of penal settlements near home, be so applied as to pay the expenses of the convicts, with great advantage to them as well as to the country, bytheir employment upon harbours of refuge and other public works. Hoe moved that the Bill be read a asecond time that day six months. Mr. Ronlucx observed that the great cause of crime in this country was the difficulty of finding employment, which tainted labour could never find, so that when a man ceased to be a convict he was driven back to crime. There was, in his opmion, but one remedy,-that of transporting all who were sentenced to transportation for life to some now uninhabited spot, after qualifybing the convict by previous probation to become a colonist. Sir T. PAorNGT0w observed that the subject was full of difficulties, but the measure of the (Government, which, as far as possible, met coniflicting views, had his approbation; his only objectionto it was the element of uncertainty it imported into the sentences,so that the public wouild not know what the sentence passed really meant. The Government, he added, should address itself to an anxious consideration of the question what was to be done with the convicts when released, in order that the change might be as innocuow as posible, sad he thought the check of a well-reulte ticket.o{-leave system would in this vie be beneficial, by keeping alive the element of hope. bIr. CorLrR insistied that the Bill did not preclude the adoption of the plan proposed by Mr. BENTrNMCx The uncertainty complained of was only as to plae, not time, and there must be a power of selection, wrhich would be best left in the hands of the Government. Mr. DRuMXOND contended that transportation had been mismanaged,-that the only way of dealing with our criminals was to carry out a system of transportation to a greater extent than heretofore, and there could be no difficulty in finding places to send them to. Mhr. PriLiPPs spoke in favour of the Bill and of the punishment of transportation. Mr. Brxc thought the grant of tickets of leave, though anpopular, if used with discretion and forbearance, should not be discontinued. ie supported the second reading of the BilL Mhr. NEwiEATz likewise supported the Bill, which, he hoped, would be a step to a renewal of transportation. The second reading of the Bill was supported by Mr. EwAIT and Mr. LiDDELL. I1r. EIENLLY condemned the legislation of the last few years upon this subject, and observed that the wouse ras nOw asked to reverse what it had done, changing, however, the well utnderstood term of transportation to that of penal servitude. Heo hoped that in the committee the former term would be substituted, or that there would be an assurance given that there was no intention to get ria of the punishent of transportation. Ir. B3AMvS, after defending the Governmnent from some remarks made by Mr. EIRNi.xv, observed, in reply to Mr. DRiThOND, tbat, in the opinion of a committee of that House, however great the ad'vantages of transportation, it was difficult,. if not imposible, to point out-any plaoe to wlriclaoniteW couId be sent. Mr. WmTzSIDX believed tha tht peopls of thi country would never be satisfied with * lUa ifWs pernitted the judge to pronounee one xentono mid the Government to substitute another nd a verW punishment. Mr. KEAMa and bMr. PacKz aupported the Bill, though with certain qualifications. Lord STAN}LeY said the question was not wlhether trnpottation was desirable or not, bat whether it was posible, and his opinion was that any attempt to found a new penal settlement in any pat of the globe would end in disappointment. If so,we Wiew thrown upon the only colony that would receive COnvicta ..nainely, Westemn Australia-and with all the pre utions we could and should take we mukt not rely upon the continuance of this resouroe which would afford an outlet for only a l£ a number of convicts. With reference to the corrigible clan of crininals he thought the ticketofleave system had in realit never had a far trialthe theory was one thing, but the practice had be*4 another. It was a fair question, in his opinion, for the Government whether it was not pomssble to finl employment for such men upon public works when the term of their imprisonment had expired. Mr. HoPz expressed a general approbation of the Bill, which enunciated) he said, one grt truth, that aconvicted criminal forfeited his time and his labour to the country, which might turn it to use either at home or abroad. -Mr. MASH suggested that a convict settlement might be established in the northern part of Aiim. fraliL. The Bill was then read a second time. Mr. ADDEaLzy moved the second reading of the Industrial Schools Bill, which he sid was verbat the sme as had been recommitted pro fom&4 in the last Parliament. He stated briefly the object of the Bill, which was a supplement or complement to the Reformatory Acts. He anticipated and replied to an objection that it was a prosefytiznig memure. Mr. BowyER opposed the Bill on two groundsfast, that it introduced principles new to the ju0ieature of the country, aud interfered with the parental authority of the poor; secondly, that the; effiect, though not the intention, of the measure wras to proselytize, since Roman Catholic children would be sent to Protestant schools. Lord R. Cro. defended the Bill. MIr. P~sx, not dissenting from the principle of the Bill, protested againlst the levying a compulsory rae upon the agricultural parishes for the purpoies of the BiILl Mir. BAsnow opposed the Bill, on the ground that 3it sanctioned an interference with pc eental authority which ought not to be tolerated, and because the provisions of the Bill went beyond the necessity of the ease. Sir G. GnRY said the Bill required very careu consideration in committee, but he hoped there would be no objection to reading it a second time. The Bill was strongly opposed by Mr. BRADY and Mr. P. O'BRa. Mr. SANorzop heartily approved the principle of the Bill, though he did not pledge himself as to all the details. After a few words from Mr. RrIDn=, upon a division the second reading was carried by 177 to 18. The CRsAcELLoR of the ExcnQuzx moved for the resppointment of the Select Committee to Inquire into the operation of the Bank Act of 18Z4 (7th and 8th VicToRu, cap. 32), and of the Bank Acts for Ireland and Scotland of 1845 (8th and 9th VimoroiA, cap. 37,38). Mr. Xanzs complained of the delay of legistion upon this subject, and of the derangement of mercantile transactions by the existinglaw. He hoped the Government would lose no time in bringing in some memure to correct the evils of the Aict of 1844. Mr. HsIAN-y contended that the Act of 1844 had nothiug to do with the higlh rate of interest, and that trade was in a sound condition. Mr. HuDsox was of opinion that a committee ws useless, and that the Government should at once legislate upon the subject. Mr. AmBTow observed, that there was no necesity for legislation, unless the House was of opinion that there should be an alteration of the Bank Charter, and he protested agailst any hasty legislai. tion on the subject. The motion was agreed to. Sir G. GEEY obtained leave to bring in a Bill to make other provision for the exercise of the powers of the General Boad of Health; and MIr. FiTZGERALD a Bill to Consolidate and Amend the Acts relating to Bankruptcy and Insolvency in Ireland. Some other business was disposed of, and the House adjourned at a quarter past 1 o'clock.
The Transportation and Penal Servitude Bill is little else than a petition for more discretionary power in dealing with convicts. It matters little to inquire how it is that Parliament should ever have been ingenioudly exact in its awardof puuishment, apportioning to various crimes their respective mode, time, and place of retribution. We have long outlived the barbaric refinement which fixed for every variety of offence its proper penalty of hanging, or burning, or decapitation, quartering, gibbeting, fine, imprisonment, branding, flogging, hard labour, and a thousand minuter curiosities of punishment. But it was but the other day that Parliament still kept in its own bands not only the length of the punishment, but the exact mode and place, not leaving to eitherJudge or Bflnister the choice between transportation, labour, and, imprisonment. In this, however, as in some other subjects, the course of events has itself baffiled calculation, and taken the decision out of our hands. In sober trath, we do not knov what we shall do with our convicts. We have not been able to adhere to any one plan, and have encountered obstacles on every side. Australia refused to take more of our crime; Norfolk Island became intolerable; England itself drives the convicts back to the gaols, and imprisonment has its own scandals and difficulties. Eyery positive measurehas beendoomed to disappointment. So the end is, that the Ho-ns SECRELTAy begs for a larger discretion. With the exception of sentences for a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years, he asks that henceforth the one general punishment shall be penal servitude, of which the time, place, and manner shall be left to the discretion of Govenmment. In fact, the step isbut a slight one upon the existing practice. A sentence to transportation is now only nominal, and mny be carried;. out, as it is often carried out, in convict labour or imprisonment at home. As transportation haa ceaed to be the rule, and has become the'rare exception, so the sentence itself must now- be changed. Sir GEORGE GREY therefore asks that, under sentences of penal servitude, the Crowx msy be empowered to deal with convicts much as it finds best in each case; to keep them simply in prison, to employ them on our public works at home, to keep them at public or private work in some colony, or to set them at large, under surveillance, at home or in our colonis, at the dis cretion of the Home-office. We are not aware of having overstated the liberty which this measure would give to the Government of the day; but, if we have not done so, it is evident that Parliament is asked to ainegate much of the nicety vith which it has hitherto treated this question. A demand for more extensire discretionary power is a very simple affair. It deprecates rather than invites inquiry into the working of. the various forms of punishment. Strictly speak-ing, the only question it raises is the competency of Government for so serious a trust. We are requested to let the Home Secretary deal with convicts as he thiniks best, or as he finds possible, out of a given range of punishments, and after the law of the laud has fixed the term in each case.

The Commissioners of HER MAJESTY'S CUstoms ]lave just discharged the unusual duty of re'porting upon themselves. They have published the first number of a descriptive, historical, and statistical account of their own office, their own functions, and the manner in which they are performed, and have affixed their signatures to a document pronouncing a decidedly favourable opinion upon most of these particulars. As praise is nothing without contrast, they find this desirable material in the proceedings of their predecessors, and work away rather unmercifully at the 'Commissioners of the last century. There was -oom enough for the exposure, certainly. Appointments of all kinds, from the highest to the lowest, were then given to political or local influence, and were often made sinecures when obtained. In 1792 Lords LIVERPOOL and STOWE.L -and the Dukes of MANCHESTER and NEWCASTLE held. all of them patent offices in the port of London without performing any duties beyond the receipt of the incomes attached. Non-residence was a thing of constant occurrence. In 1784, -ays the Report, " the principal Customer or Col4' lector of Hull was to be found in London, his "Deputy at Glasgow, and the chief Searcher at 6 Dorchester." But even Hull was better off in 1this respect than Chester, the patent officer of which place was not to be found at all. In the very year last-mentioned the Deputy-Controller of liverpool, then a sub-port of Chester, departed -this life, but when the Chester functionary was inquired for to renew the nomination he 'was discovered to be in the East Indies. At the same happy period of our annals, too, it was found that of the patent offices in the Customs, 483 in number, at the several outports of the kingdom, all were sinecures but ten. In these days of free trade, competitive examination, and ,commercial despatch, the Commissioners, of course, Voexpatiate with considerable complacency on their *own system, when compared with the ancient maodel; but, perhaps, if Lord LIVERPOOL and his colleagues had sat down to report upon the -Customs in their own days, they might have pointed with a similar amount of satisfaction to the doings under King JAMES and Queen ELIZABETH. However, there is really good ground for gratulation and applause, as the reader will pre-oently discover. Whatever may be thought in the present day of indirect taxation, there is no doubt that the imposts known under the name of " Customs" can 4ake rank, in point of dignified antiquity, next to -ithes themselves. Their origin, in fact, is lost in the darliness of ages, for, even when they first appear in legal form, which they do in the year 1297, their very designation of " Customs" implies that they were levies of a customary or immemorial kind. At that time they were principally laid, not upon imports, but upon exports; as, for example, upon -wool, and the whole produce, generally realized -through the farming process, amounted even a 'Century later to but 8,0001. ' About 1650 they had risen to 500,0001.; in 1760 they yielded ~2,000,000l.; in 1800, 11,000,0001.; and in 1856 24,000,0001. ; having thus multiplied twelvefoll in the space of a century. The most astonishing fact, however, in these statistics remains yet to be announced. Betweenthe year 1831 and thepresent -time reductions in the Customs! duties have taken place to the agggTegate amount of 10,613,610l., -and yet these enormous remissions, so far from impairiing the productiveness of the tevenue, have actualy left it more considerable than before. -Its total amount in 1835 was 23,149,0001., whereas in 1855, after all the retrenchlaents, it was 23,482,0001. In fact, notwithstanding the abolition of duty upon duty, till the sum of the abolitions equals the entire produce of this branch of our taxes at the beginning of the present century, the gross income has continued to range from 22 to 23 millions without any appreciable variation. During this period, moreover, the progress of reform in other directionB has been extraordinary, and appears always attended with the same marvellous and uncheckered succesqs. The less money we asked for the more came in, and the greater the produce the less was the charge. The percentage cost of collection was between 14 and 15 per cent. in 1816, between 11 and 12 in 1823, and between 7 and 8 ten years later. It is now between 5 and 6. In 1821 the officers on the establisbment, exclusive of the Coast-guard, were.7,259 in number; they received 770,5131. in salaries, andthey superintended imports of the official value of 30 millions and upwards. In 1855 the officers superintending imports, computed by the like reckoning at upwards of 117 millions, were only 5,539 in number, and were remunerated by 687,2411. Somebody must have taken the broom in hand to right good purpose in this department. In the ten years ending 1830 the number of offices abolished was 3,408, and the salaries retrenched exceeded 250,0001. Since 1849, 45 persons, and, including the Coast-guard, upwards of 60,0001. in salaries, have been reduced. Of course, the vast extension of business has occasionally rendered augmentations necessary per contra, but the percentage above quoted will place the general balance of inorease and reduction beyond all question. It is extremely curious to observe the operation of financial reforms in alternately lessening and increasing the work of the Castom-house officers. The establishment, in addition to its traditional duties, is now charged with the admeasurement of tonnage-a nice scientific process; with the " registration" of all floating property-a measure c analogous to that which most countries except "England have found it well to institute for "landed property ;" with the collection of light dues; with the receipt of wreck; with the superintendence of oyster and other fisheries in adjacent waters; and with the duty, necessitating " ex" treme vigilance," of scrutinizing the condition of cattle arriving from abroad, " in order to pre" vent the introduction of infectious disorders " among the sheep and horned cattle of this "country." There are actually quarantine sheds kept up for the receipt and detention of animals forming part of a diseased cargo. On the other hand, nothing can exceed the relief afforded by the consolidation of the Customs' Laws and the diminution in the number of dutiable articles. In 1787 there were 290 principal articles and 1,135 sub-divisions on the list; there are now but 414 altogether, and we trust to see this total much further reduced. At the end of the last century, moreover, some 300 articles were taxed according to their value, a process involving great trouble and labour, whereas now the list of commodities so estimated compmes but 50. The repeal of the Navigation Laws brought another great relief, by the abolition of a number of intricate questions and problems formerly pressed upon the attention of the Board, " and it is "difficult," adds the Report, " to say whether "the expansion of trade, the interests of ship"owners, or the comforts of Customs' officers have "been most effectually promoted by the change." Though the Commissioners are in the position of men pronouncing their own panegyric, we believe they are fairly justified in claiming a large amount of credit for the extensive and unremitting increase of facilities which have been extended to the operations of commerce during this progress of Customs' reform. The bonding system, with all its ramified conveniences, the abolition of fees and fines, the arrangement for credit and drawbacks, and even the better regulation of the! hours of duty, have all tended greatly to the interest and satisfaction of the public. As a natural sequel of all these improvements, smuggling has wonderfully decreased. With the exception of those little peccadilloes committed by " inconsiderate or unprincipled passengers," smuggling proper is now confined almost exclusively to tobacco, spirits, and watches; and the total number of seizures of all kinds, which in 1846 was 3,015, had diminished in 1856 to 2,299. In 1783-that period which seems to iUustrate every enormity-it was computed that 13,000,000 gallons of spirits and 7,000,000 pounds of tea were brought to market from ilicit sources, and at the moment that the duty upon brandy was 9s. a-gallon the article itself was "very generally" sold upon the coast at 3s. In a special retrospect given of more recent years some evidence is furnished of no small public interest. We are not referring to a decision recorded by the Commissioners as involving a "considerable boon to the consumer,"-the assimilation, namely, of plums to prunes, nor to tho simplification of procedure by which all musical instruments are now admitted at the uniform rate of 9d. per pound; but it is truly gratifying to observe, that whi1e the duty on coffee was raised 33 per cent. for the exigencies of the war, the utmost diminution of consumption was only 6 per cent., and that the falling off in the case of tea, after an addition of 17 per cent. to the duty, was actually only one-quarter per cent. With one more remarka'ole noaification regarding a portion of the United Kingdom not often selected in former days for such announcements, we may well afford to close our observations. " The accounts from "Ireland," states the Report, " are especially satis"factory. There has been an increase in the "revenue receipts at every port, with three excep"tions, and in these the aggregate decrease "scarcely exceeds 1,0001. The general improve"ment is by our officers unanimously attributed to "the flourishing state of agriculture and the re"munerating prices of farm produce, which enable "the cultivator of the soil to indulge in the com"forts and luxuries of life to a far greater extent "than formerly."
The case of " BBREMER v. FnEnrA and BBmm" has recently been argued at great length before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. As the point at issue is of considerable interest to the public, we will endeavour here to give the substance and meaning of a judgment which in its reported form may be somewhat uninviting fo the general reader. It was a question of whether or not probate should be granted to a will made by an English lady in France, the bulk of her property being in England. She was the daughter of a General CALOP.AFT, an officer in the East India Company's service, and was born in India in the year 1795. By origin, then, she had an Anglo-Indian domicil. She returned with her father and sister to England in the year 1805, and in England she remained with her father for twenty years; all this time her domicil was undoubtedly English. In 1825 or 1827 she left her father, and with her governess travelled about the Continent, residing for a considerable period in Italy. In 1834 General CALciAa died, and the sister of the testatrix joined her. They either remained in Italy or travelled about together until 1838, when the two sisters settled in Paris. For two years they occupied funaizhed lodgings,, ad then hired apartmunts in the Boulevard des Capucines. Here the sister died in 1840, and here, too, the testatix died ia 1853, without ever having quitted Paris at aU since the year 1838. She made a wiU in the English form. The questions for decision were three in number. First, had she acquired. a French domicil? If she had, was a Will made according to the English form sanctioned by the municipal law of France ? On the answer to this qnestion would depend the anawer to the third, which was the one actually at issue before the Judicial Committee-Was her will such an one as ought to be admitted to probate in this country ?_ There seems to have been little or no hesitation in determining that the testatrix had actually acquired a French domicil. She had resided for fifteen years in Paris without any special business to detain her there. The animus redeundi, indeed, appears to have been as much negatived. by her express declarations as by her acts; for she had frequently stated that it was her firm resolution never to return to England, and that when she died it was her wish to be buried by the side of her sister in the cemetery of Pare la Chaise. This point of the French domicil being establiahed, the far more diflicult one arose as to the validity, according to the municipal law of France, of a will made in English form. The settled opinion of English lawyers, as stated last week by LordWENsLEYDATE, is "that the form and solemnities of "the testament must be governed by the law of "the donmcil of the deceased." It might, however,:be the case that the law of France would be permissive on this point, and admit the valdity of the will made by a foreigner domiciled in France, even if made according to the solemnities of that foreigner's domicil of origin. The Frenclh lawyers seem to be divided in opinion onthis matter. Some say that the will must be in the form of the place where it is made; others that it may be either in the form required by the domicil of origin or the domicil at the time of death. At thispoint the French lawyers draw a fresh distinction, upon which the decision of the English judges appears to have depended in good measure. They say that a foreigner may, indeed, acquire a " simple French domicil," but, unless that domicit be sanctioned by the authorization of the EmPEROR, he will not enjoy civil rights. This distinction is based upon the 13th article of the Code Napolen, which runs thus:-" The foreigner who shall have "been admitted by authorization of the EMpE soR "to establish his domicil in France shall enjoy "there all the civil rights so long as he shall "continue to reside there." From the aff6mative in this proposition the negative is inferred-viz., that without authorization of the EMPEROn the foreigner domiciled in France shall not enjoy civil rights. But what are the civil rights spoken of ? Is the right of testacy among the number ? If so, does the right of testacy from which he is shut out apply to his personal goods which may be situate out of France as well as to those which lie within the jurisdiction of the Empire ? What are the rights of his relatives if he die in this necessary condition of intestacy? The argument would go the full length that if a foreigner domiciled in France, but without Imperial authorization, cannot make a will at all, the will of the testatrix in the present case was invalid according to the law of France, and therefore necessarily invalid according to the maxim of the English lawyers, "locus regt actum." This last result would equally follow from the position that, it, is not necessary to have an authorization I ffix* the EMPEROr in order to have a domicil whi,h would regulate the succession, aud such an -me as would confer the power of testacy. In England we require that a will should be made with the Solemnities and forms of the domicil at the time of death, and therefore the wiU of an English subject domiciled in France, but made according to the English form, would be invalid. The prior judgment of the Judge of the English Prerogative Court, in favour of admitting the will to probate, was therefore reversed. "The maxim," said Lord WEwsIEYDA.E, " that mobilia sepquntwr personam has " so long prevailed that it may be treated now as " part of the jus gentium. It follows from this "maxim that the post-mortuary distribution of "the effects of a deceased person must be made "according to the law of his domicil at the time "of his death; and it equally seems to follow that "if the law of the country allowed him to make "a will the wiUl must be in the form and with "the solemnities which that law required." This is the rule of internatiorJal law which all English, and we believe mort foreign, lawyers consider as firmly established. The point of chief interest to British subjects in this long decision, as it was, indeed, the chief point in litigation, was as to the power of testacy enjoyed by an English subject in France domiciled in France, but without special authorization of the Government. The judgment of the Judicial Committee most assuredly decides that in the present state of the French law such a power exists. We have not space here to enter upon the discussion of the decided cases before the French tribunals which led the Committee to this decision, but they will be found in extenso in our report of the judgment this day; here we can only deal with the conclusion. It is to be regretted that the French Government, or the French tribunals, should leave foreigners to flounder about among conflicting cases on a subject of such very serious importance. In another portion of the decision, indeed, we find it stated that perhaps the restraint upon the power of testacy implied by the 13th article of the Code Napoteorn may be taken as practically annulled by a subsequent law of the 14th of July, 1819," foreigners are entitled to succeed and to dispose "and receive in the same way as French subjects "in all the extent of the kingdom." As was pertinently enough remarked by Lord WxNsrxDALE, "if a stranger can dispose of his personal "property in France or anywhere else by will, "why should he be less able to do it because he is "domiciled in France ?" But if there be a doubt abotit the matter at all, why should it not at once be set at rest? The English judges have been compelled to pick their way painfully through a maze of conflicting decisions, and one Court has overruled the judgment of another. This ought not to be. Had a dozen more " experts" been called in to make additional confusion, perhaps the inclination of opinion among our judges might have turned the other way, to be again re-adjusted upon the occasion of a fresh decision before a fresh French tribunal. It seems a pity that in a case of this kind, where reaUy the decision entirely turned upon ascertaining what the law of France really was, the ques'tion could not have been brought before the highest French court of civil judicature. If there be any technical difliculty of form, it surely might easily be overcome. The shortest way in such matters seems the simplest and best. Why should not the English Ambassador in Paris have handed the question from the English Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to the Foreign Minister in Paris, who in his turn would have delivered it for solution to the French Minister of Justice, who, of course, would be the best judge of how a satisfactory reply could be obtained ? However professional lawyers may shudder at Eo direct a proceeding, we really cannot see what mischief would follow from such an exchange of legal courtesy among nations.

ABT TBRABSUBA$" 2XEIBITIO' - 3 ANCHEMSTEE MLAy iL. The attendance here on Saturday was larger t:iin could have been anticipated,considering thatdunring the greater part of the day the unfavourable weather did so much to deter visitors, and threatened to do still more. Nevertheless, thehalfcrown payments at the doora amounted to more than 3001., while frotn the sale of season tickets-both one and two gulnea -upwards of 2001. was gained. The total receipts, therefore, including the profit on the sale of catalogues, programmes, &c., were 6001. During the early part of to-day the rain fell heavily, and, of course, for the first one or two hours after the opening the receipts were proportionably affected. T owardathe afternoon, however, theweather changed againfor the better, and with the returning sunshine therewasa steadyinfluxof visitors tillnearly4 o'clock, at which time between 6,000 and 6,000 had poured into the building. Though on the whole the attendance to-day was much smaller than on Saturday last, yet, n comp-nsco, the money paid foradmission has been greater in amount. At a rou-'h estimate, therefore, the income of to-day may e fairly set down at between 5001. and 6001. These results are in every way gratifying, though, as we have already said, the full measure of the Exhibition's popularity, and the certainty of its succes in a financial point of view, will not be seen until the shilling days commence, which are anniously-looked forward to byhalf Manchester and all the saurrounding districts. Within the last few days muasc has been added to the attractions of the sister arts, and a choice programme is performed each aftemoon by the band under the careful direction of Mr. 0. lea6. This forms an agreeable interlude, particularly to those who, after long promenading through the saloons and galleries, are compeUed to rest on the seats provided round the orchestra. No proof is required to demonstrate the triumphant success of the Exhibition hitherto. If one, however, were wanting, it would be found in the letters which daily reach the heads of its various departments. The possessors of many fine work-a of art.who entertained the committee's application to exhibit with coldness, and who up to the time of the opening had not sent in, are now anxious to repair their omissions, while hundreds of persons who were never solicited at all are besieging the management with eager importunities to be permitted to contribute at least one object-picture, carvng, or whatever it may be. In fact, collectors at last seem to be aware tbat the mere fact of their gems being selected for exibbition along with the greatest masterpieces of the world will confer on their contributions a status in art which hoarding for centuries in galleries and cabinets could never give. Among the objects recently sent in is a bedstead of carved oak, which, though only the work of a working joiner at Warrington, is probably one of the finest and most elaborate specimens of decorative furniture in the whole building. It is in the Renaissance style, and most beautifully carved with mottoes, figures, fruit, and flowers, all in high relief. Its origin is due to the Exbibition of 1851, which the workman visited, and was fired to emulation by the sight of the Austrian furniture. He returned home to Warrington, determined to excel the examples he had seen, and hence the present bedatead, which is no less a grand monument of his industry than of his talent for design and skill In execution. During Sunday, of course, the building was closed to the public, and a briade of photographers took advantago of the dies iion to make coDies of many of the chef deuvres for Colnaghi's work on the Exhibition, which will be an enduring record of the marvellous works which for the first time is ]ngland's history, at least, have ever been brought together. At present all the hotels here are full to repletion, while each day adds to the number of visitors.

RAGGED SCROOL UNIoN.-Yesterday evening the aunual meeting of the friends and supporters of the liagged School Union was held at Exeter-hall, under the presidency of the Earl of Shaftesbury. Every part of the hall was densely crowded, and among the noblemen and gentlemen on the platform were Lord Kinnaird, lord Ashley, MY., Dr. Cinumming, Dr. M'Cree, the Revs. Bickersteth, Wilkinson, Patteson, Moxom, N. W. Robinson, Marsh, W. H. Graham, &c., M[r. J. Payne, Mr. Haldane, &c. The Chairman said he rejoiced that the friends of ragged 6chools assembled.in such numbers to testify their unalated feeling for the advancement of the great cause, and their sympathy with those who were engaged in it, and, he hoped, their determination to sustain and enlarge it. (Applause.) Although they had not made the progress during the last year that they had hoped for and had a right to expect, nevertheless they had something to record. The state of things, as compared with what it was a few years ago, was, indeed, glorious and magnifcent. The present number of their scholhrswas 22,000, and the numuber of their scboolsmlht be estimated at about 350 in 156 distinct buildings. But there were 22,000 children more still wandering about like the Bedonins in the Desert, with none to care for them in body or soul. Indeed, there were whole districts where thousands were congregated together, and where there was not even the semblance of a place in which the rudiments of education could be imparted. He regretted that there was a deficiency of teachers, so that in some disticts there were many applicants for instruction whose wants could not be supplied. The ragged school children who had emigrated had done great credit to their teachers, and, notwithstanding former prejudices, a ragged school certificate was found to be a pamsport to service. The shoeblack brigade had earned no less than 2,300& during the year, of which about 6401. had been placed to their credit in savings-banks. He hoped that some arrangement would be made by which the many shoe. blacks who were not connected with the ragged schools might be subjected to the same regulations as those who were. If the IBagged School Union were provided with adequate funds he had no doubt that m tnyoherforms of industry and employment would be devised no less successful than the shoe-cleaning had proved; he hoped, therefore, that the institution would be amply sup ted by pecuniary contributions and personal service. lee read tho report of the committee. It apeas that two schools have been removed from and nine added to the list during the year. There have been in operation 139 Sunday bchools, with 18,000 scholars, 100 day-schools with 14,700 scholars; and 118 evening schools with 7,500. These 357 uchools are carried on in 157 school buildings, being an increase of seven upon the previous year. The number of industrial classes has not increased. The shoe-black brigades continue to flourish and the boys on the whole improve in steadiness and efficiency. In the three brigades 132 lads earned lst yer 2,98U. by cleaning boots and shoos at Id. a-pair. Of this sum 1,6001. have been paid to the lads for food and necessaries; 7231. paid for superintendence and 'sun expenset; mnd 6401. have been paid into the savings-banks to the credit of the boys. A new shoe-black society for the West-end has been organized, and will shortly be in operation in the aristocraticdomi4n of Belgravia. A new society for boys to sweep crossings will also shortly be tried. Several of the lads in the shoe-black bridages have saved money and emigrated to Canada, and some had been promoted hrindividuals for matked pro-prity of conduct. During the year 641 boys and 619 girls have been placed out in situations from 59 schools. The number of those who have kept in one place with good characterfor 12 months bas increased from 366to 402. It was 3'so stated Qhat 70 teachers in the schools were formerly ragged scholars, and that out of 15 schools 70 have become communicants at various Christian churches. The number of refuges is 16, receiving and maintaining on an average 500 young persons. The report also testifies to the utility of the mothers' meetings, and of the labours of the city missionaries The penny-banks have been so succesful that persons residing in the locality have taken advatae of them to deposit their little saTvings. 5here are nowi m 44 of the schools no less than 10,117 depositors, and the 'sums paid in during the year have amounted to 3,439r. Clothing tunds are now in operation in 31 of the schools, and the amount paid in by the children baa been 3061, The financial statement was next read. With the balance in hand last year, -collections, donations, subscriptions, legacy, &a he receipts have amounted to 7,8241. The expenditure, including 2,9961h for special grants, as amounted to 6,952l., leaving a balance in hand of 8721.

MILITARY AND NAVAL INTALLIQBOZg. We have letes from our Malta correspondent to the 6th of May, announcingthe arriVAl in port on the 30th of April, after oruing for eight days in the offing, of Admiral Lord Lyons, the Commi nder-in-Chief, in the Royal Albert srw stamshoipof the line, accompanied by the Conqueror, Cen. turion, and Srunswick screw steam liners, and Ariel steam corvette. On ile Royal Albert appearing at the mouth of the port a salut ef l1gas, due to therankof an Admiral Comniander.ini.Chiel, waslired from Fort St. An3gelo, and on the ahip passing the naval arenal the Hibernia receivizng ship, moored in the Dockyard-crook, bearing the flag of the Rear.Adnmiral Superintendent, Sir Montagu Stopford, K.C.B., fired an equal number ,fguns, the sailors on board and the soldiers on the battery making the air resound with vociferous cheering. On the Boyal Albert being made snug at her moorings she returned the oDmpliment to the flag of Sir Montagu Stopford by a slute of nine guns, due to the ankof aliear.Admiral. At about I o'clock Admiral Lyoii qaitted his shipunaer another salute of 17 guns from Fort St, Angelo to proeeed on shore to pay his respects to the Go. *Vernor, Sir William Reid, who returned the visit the nest morning. His Eroellencys return on shore Was anno-noed by a salute from, the flagship. It was sup poeed that the Royal Albert would stay in port about thre weeks, at the terimintion of which period it was believe she would proceed, accompanied by the other ships of the squadron, for a cruise off the coast of Spain. On Friday and Saturday the French, Russian, and several ofthe other foreign oonsuls paid their respects to the Admiral, who on their leaving hoisted the colours of their repective nations and fired a salute.

GENERAL AsnnUrIIA r.-The appointment of General Ashburn]am to the commmd iu China may be a good appointment, or it may be a bad one. The averments u! w.ieh b th his assailants and his defendants found their argumentts apper to us singularly narrow and inconclusive We see nothing for it but to wait until General Ashburnham gives proof of his capacity or incapacity by hs actions, before we express any opinion respecting him. At the same time we inuet say that the question raised by the impugners of the appointment is a perfectly legitimate subject of discussion; nnd that certain doctrines regarding it, enonnoed ecz catihedrd ia the House of Lords, are&utterly untenable. These doctrines, if acquiesced in, would nece. sarly lead to the suppression of-all criticism or free discus. sion of the conduct of military public servants-a conclusion so monstrous that it would have been unnece.isary even to record a protest against the doctrines, but for the universa assent apparently given to them by the peers. In the first place we are told, with especial reference to the case of General Ashburnbam, that it is unfair to attack a public servant in his absence-that is, when he is out of the country. That the public servant attacked is out of the country at the time may be a verygood reason for suspending judgment until he has an oppOrtunity of defending himself; but it must obviously, in many cases, be no reason whatever for postponing the attack upon him. ChargGs broughtforward against a public servant, in the press or in Parliament, do not belong to the category of secret denunciations. 'They are publicly made; they cannot escape the notice of the party accused, or his friends; 2nd they can be publicly answered. It maybe that to postpone them till the return home of the inculpated party would defeat the object for which they are made. An ambassador mat be compromising the character of his country, or sacrifcing its interests, by his misconduct of a negotiation ; a general may be ruining an army or incurring defeat by his incapecity; a colonial governor may be stirring up rebellion by his oppressions; in each and all of these cases, if no charge is to be brought against the delinquent until he is functlzs officio, and returns home, incalculable injury 'may be inflicted on the nation,, which timely inquiry and discussion might have prevented. This illustration does not exaetly meet the case of General Ashbumhbam; bat it is necessay .to place it before the public, because the doctrine that no publid servant ought to be araigned in his absence from the country has been stated with such an lutter want of qualifioation or reserve s to' render it obvious that the blow is struck at free and fair discussion in the abstract. Nor do the peculiar features of General Ashburnhbams case appear to us to be such as to witbdraw it from the catagory of those which call for instnt discussion. We are told thiat the objections to his appointment ought to have been urged before he left the country-that they ought to have been brought forward in Parliament. The appointment was made about the middle of March- the objections were publiihed about the middle of April. Parliameat only remained stting for one week, after the appointment was made. Before it was announced most of the members of the House of Commons had left town to attend to their electioneering interests, and the remnant were absorbed in the task of hurrying to a elose the routine business of the session. Any attempt tbraise a debate on the merits of the appointment that could lead to any practical result would I have been hopelem& Again, the only non-oSioial psrties cc mpetent to form a judgment of General Ashburnhami's fitness for comcnank may have themselve8s been out of the ccuntiy at the Wine the appointment was announoej A month would. im this posaible case, be no very long period to be valow,4 to elapse before tbev transmitted their objec t-ons to 1U appointment for pu bcltioi in the pbaers And the nital interest the country has in having an objee. tionable 4ppointment rescinded was a snfficient reason for irvikUg ateation to the subiect wrhile it was still'Poasible fer a scaJl to oveitake the General before he reahed thse i~**vi w.-qnprse.

Hemodeatly ata that hi intention was merely to deacribe his own personiL ImpreCsions, without dogrmatically claiming for them a&nr exclusive value, and, consistently with this preratory declsration, the vichwitudes that he experienced in the cous of his isit to the seat of war were interwoven throughout wAi the series of gres%t events of which be waa a spechtor. The first part of his lecture comprised his fortunes from the time when he left Marseilles to the arnival of the *llied forces in the CAimea,-and at the beginning was jocul.r enough. The nuisances endured at Gallipoli, thou& seriousat the time of endurance, ca be laughed at wheom they are over, and Mr. W. nussells record of 'vlllainous smells" created as much mirth as Falstafs. - Even the sca;nty supplies of tents1, provisions, and ammunition oedB be hghtly treated, and the remnark of siomebody that " aix amy directed by stationery was sre to be a stationry arsn," wras an acceptable bon tt. The early portiof the sojourn in and about Yarna allowed the narrative to be continued in the same plecsntvein, and the description ofa, eamp starting into activity in the morning wsz as fines apecimenof word p ting as one would wish tohear. Te pleAures attendant on various excitements were n ated in the best poesible humour, but the narrative became more gravo as it proceeded. The lassitude thattookpossess of the army as the result of lone inactivity and the failure,of all means of amusement cauae a a sort of prelude to th cholera, the ravages of which were described by Mi. Russell with immense power-the lecturer allowing himself a more liberal use of -allegorical imagery th at the commencement of his narrative. The departgr& for the Crimea brought the tale of horror to its teri mination, and the landing of the troops led to a oonesolatorY remark with reference to the possibility of a. French invasion. Although no enemy was at hand and lio obstacle was presented by stress of weather, four days wre occupied in landing an army that even when on shore Was in no immediate condition to begin a campaign. At tbis point Mr. Russell retired for a few mlnutes, a4id the map was changed for a plan of the battle ot the AlMA- To this great battle, and the events th;aimmediately preceded it, the whole of the second part of the lecture was devoted. Wand in hand, Mr. BueL desiPated the various positions marked on the pl A, and went through the entire battle As if kle were witnessing it onoe more. The glittering of bayonets in the sun, the movement of red masees up the heights, the dak g9ry cots of the enemy, which at a distance looked like patches of wood, were reproduoed with wonderful vivacity in the imagination of the lecturer, and, through him, in that of the hearers. With particular impressiveness did he dwell on the manifestation Of &certain feeling, uninorn in times of peace, when the, Russians were frst in-sight-the "iCainlike feeline'wlhen. tbe prospect of komicide afford a ferocious plesure At each point of his narrative he boldly claimed the sympathies of his hearers, and At the record of some particularly gallant deed they cheered aloud as if the exploit belonged to the proceding moment. The announoementof thevictory -for so we may call it-was received with a burst of enthudasm, HoWever, Mr. Russell did not allow his Andienee to leave him in a state of unmixed exultation, but Pave a most thrilling description of the horrors of a. battlefield when the contest isover. ew lecturers have ever undertaken so weightya taskas Mr. usselL His discouras latedfor full two hours and a- half, and required greater exertion at the end than at th# beginning He departed from the platform followed bylou& aeclamations, and will resume his nazrrative on Thursa next,

SmsxE OF OS;ItS SnvA.asM-.Some excitement was created yesterday in the north-western and& western distzicts of the metropolis by the paing to *n& fro during the day of from 200 to 300 rough-looking menhalf-ostler and half-cad-who declared themselves to be the servants of the London General Omnibus Company " on strike," and have been going about to the stables of the. compan in the different district esUblishments, calling upon their brethren to join with them in throwing themselves out of work. The om ibues of the company are 60( in number, and, every omnibus having 10 horses, eaoh vehicle is placed separately under the care of a horsekeeper, whom. business it is to deliverthem over in good order every mornirg to the driver and condnctor. The clas of men employed as horsekeepers are of course rough and uneducated, And the company found on purchasing the various" I yas' an& establishments that also, as a matter of oourse, they were receiving low wages, averaging from 16s. to 18s. wqeedly while those ges were made up by a mutual a2reement, which generally led to the extra sum paid by coachman and conductor to tbe horsekeeper being levied on the employer. Thus, as a bribe for '- tnmg out the horses and omnibtisw smart" every morning, it had become a custom forthe eon. ductor or coachman to pay 6d. a-day to the horsekeepa. am gratuity. This sum, by mutual understanding, was too often "made up" from the earnings of the omnIbus.

FOREIGNf INTELLIGENCE. wIFABIUi. (FROM OUVB OWN CORESrPONDENT.) (A portlon of the following appeared lu our second edi. edon of veaterdav :-1 FJ?AIU, bUNDAY, MAX ±V, 0 F'j. I If one is to credit, not all, but even half of what is heard from people who seem to have reason for 'what they say, the Court is by this time a little ,disenchanted of its Grand Ducal visitor, and no very 'bitter tears would be shed on either side if the parting hour were to be to-morrow. Many little circumstance3 indicate, it is said, that, wbatever favourable opinion his Russian Bighness has, in common with every impartial man, of the inteUectual powers of the Emperor of the French, he has no firm faith in the durability of the Imperial regime. Perhaps he bas been disappointed in his expectations of winning him back from the error of his ways, that is, his adhesion to the alliance with England; and this may have warped his judgment or embittered his feelings. It is pretty certain, however, that his opinion of a few other personages, who, like the loose odds and ends attached to the tail of a kite, and which are pulled up after it into the air, now soar amid the clouds, is not verv exalted. The Grand Duke is not solitary in his judgment, others probably think the same in silence; but the Grand Duke now and then hints his opinion to those about him. The first Napoleon once said-it was long after the sentimental scene at Erfurt-that if you scraped a Russian you would find the Tartar underneath; and I believe something of the Tartar has appeared. Then his Imperial Highness in thought to be rather abrupt and haughty to some of those with whom he comes into contact; and a manner which may be suited to St. Petersburg, where, at the 'wi of the Sovereign, the highest dignitary may be reduced to the lowest rank,is out of place in a civilized and polite nation. An anecdote is now running the round of certain circles, which, though I do not guarantee its trutb, still rests on fair authority. A person having waited on the Grand Duke in his apartment on some business of the day was received rather abruptly, and addressed laconically with "Parlez haut, Motsiver, et a?ite-et finissons." The Grand Duke gives, perhaps, too literal an interpretation to the Emperor's manly avowal in the famous manifesto soon after the establishment of the Empire, about his being a parvenu. The Emperor knovws as well as anybody that there are two sorts of people who come under that description. The man who raises himself by his own merits from an obscure station to one of eminence may justly feel proud, and may boast of his success; he may hold his head high, and despise the malevolence of the envious. He may maintain, without airogance, his independence towards all and against all, and not sacrifice a particle of his selfrespect to an over-hasty and undignified anxiety to be identified with those who derive from others what he has attained by himself. The otherparvenu -the class known under a more ordinary but more emphatic designation-is onewho is ready to sacrifice everything to the desire of being considered what lie is not, and what those whom he fawns upon will never readily admit him to be. When the Emperor Napoleon declared himself a parvenu it was cartany the more honourable sigruficance he gave to the term, but I doubt if the Grand Duke Constantine interprets it in the same way. TheEmperor may take it for granted that even if hesucceeded in bringing the whole of the continental Sovereig,ns to his levee, if they vied with each other in adulating him, and in seeking his friendship and alliance, and loading his representatives with gifts and honours, he 'would be considered by them no otherwise than as an intruder-never as a legitimate mnember of the fraternity. His position as the head of a great and powerful nation ought to be a proud one. Hfis in. iluence and his dignity will not be enhanced by their yielding to his preSSing invitations to visit him; for they consider their acceptance as a condescension, and, if honour be in question, that they confer inatead of receiving it. The Grand Duke Constantine is by general account a well-informed man; indeed so well informed as to Inow that he has still mucl to learn. That he should have a keen desire to become acquainted 'with every object of curiosity in a country he now 'visits for the first time is quite natural; but it is remarked that he is, perhaps, too minute in his search after knowledge, and too exact in noting down all he sees and hears, no doubt for future use. hIis impressions de voyage must be a curious collection. Speculation is still busy with the sudden departure of Prince Napoleon. A telegraphic despatch from Berlin informs us that the Prince has delivered to the King an autograph letter relating to the Neuchitel question, and he will doubtless take the opportunity of pressing on His Majesty its speedy settlement-with what effect remains to be seen. The little sympathy between the Prince and the Grand Duke is, nevertheless, thought to have had much to do with his quitting Paris at a moment like this. Though everybody knows how terribly effective and rapid the King of Prussia is in his movements, yet the settlement of the Swiss questioa would not have been materially retarded by the delay of a few days more. It is also remarked as strange that the Prince should not have remained to attend the banquet given by his fatber, Prince Jerome, to the Grand Duke yesterday at the Palais Royal, which is also the residence of Prince Napoleon. The banquet was apparently a great affair. The Russian Ambassador at this Court, the one at London, General Todtleben, and a crowd of Ras8ian personages " of distinction," now in Paria (their name is Legion), the whole 'of the Ministers, the Presidents of the great bodies of the State, the Marshals, the Admirals, the dignitaries of the Emperor's household, the Genemis who are aides-decamp to the Emperor, the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, the Governor of the Invalides, the General commanding the National Guard, the Commander of the Army of Paris, the cream of the Senate, and the quintessence of the Deputies, 'with " other persons of distinction," alL met to do honour to the Grand Duke; all were there, except the son of the host. Can it be that the Prince anticipated but little pleasure in keeping time to the Russian national hymn, which the Moniteur says was executed during dinner by the band of the Paris Guards T Be this as it may, it is certain that there was but little affection between the Princes when they first met, and it has pleased Heaven to diminish it on further acquaintance. The Grand Duke is described as rather haughty; Prince Napoleon is over frank, has no great powers of mulation, and is apt to speak out, what he thinks. It was perhaps better, under the circumstances, to avoid all occasions of unpleasant contact. Feruk Ehan, the Persian Ambassador, declared yesterday at the Foreign-office that he not only had not received any confirmation of the report that the treaty of peace with Great Britain had not been ratified, but what rendered such a fact highly improbable is, that since the treaty was signed he had received despatches from the Court of Teheran directing him to insist on certain terms which he had already introduced into the treaty. It is said that theMaritime Commission appointed to give an opinion on the question of a Transatlantic steam communication has decided on three points: -1st, the concentration of the service in a single port; 2d, the necessity for a large Government subsidy; and, 3d, the obligation on the company which ahl obtain the contract to establish the service with zperfectly new shipping. The Iete commemorative of the deliverance of Orleans by Jeanne d'Arc took place on Thursday last in that city. A solemn service was celebrated at St. Croix, after which M onseigneur Gillis, the Roman Catholic Bishop of the district of which Edinburgh is the capital, ascnded the pulpit, and pronounced a pan nc on the heroine whose fate was being ceiebrats A cortoge was then formed of the civil and military authorities and of all the clergy of the town, which proceeded from the Cathedral to the Place dee Tourelles. The streets were lined by troops of the garrison. The procession returned to the Cathedral, where a To was chanted, and the stazdard of Jeanne d'Ar= was ommitted by the Mayor to the care of the Bishop of Orleansf,rhe MIayor requested that Monseigneur Gillis would permit his sermon to be printed, which requeBt was granted. the folowing private telegraphic despatch has been reeived ;- "KARSEILLes, MAY 9.

The Vienna papers have received no news from Pesth which was not contained in my letters of the 5th and Gth inst., but they bring the text of the reply of the Emperor to the Primate of Hungary, who expressed the sentiments of the nobility, clergy, and civil authorities of the country. As a matter of course, the speech of the Cardinal Archbishop was complimentary, congratulatory, and loyal, and to it His Majesty gave the following answer in the Hungarian language: "It affords me pleasure to have been able to come again, in order to ohow this beautiful country to the Empress, and to examine in person into the condition and necessities of my well-loved Hungary. It is my continual endeavour to inorease the general well-being of this country and of the whole of mny empire, and thereby to satisfy my loyal subjects." The Emperor was more than once interrupted by the cry of "}3ljen! " (Vivat), and the impressionable and sanguine Magyars probably felt something very like enthusiasm, for one of them was in a state of great excitement when, in the course of the evening, he communicated to me the substance of what HIis Majestyhad said. It produced an un-ipleasant impression on the lungarians that the Emperor appeared among them in an Austrian uniform, but their wish to see their King in the' national costume is likely soon to be gratified. As everything is done by rule and compass at this Court, it was settled, and that long before their Majesties went to Pesth, that the Em-; peror should wear a General's uniform, and the Empress a "H ungarian head-dress" (Ungarischer kopf-putz). The presentations to their Majesties took place in the following order:-1. The Privy Councillors, Chamberlains, and nobility 2. The military men. 3. The Catholic clergy. 4 The emploiygs. 5. The Protestant clergy. 6. The representatives of the Jewish communities. The speeches of M. von Conrad, the burgomaster of Pesth, and of M.Kallina, the burgomaster of Buda, were certainly not to the taste of the Hungarians, and probably gave but little satisfaction to their Majesties. They were a mixture of servility and bombast. The Empress is a general favourite with the people, but even the uneducated classes feel that it is not in good taste to speak of her as "the adored" (die angebelhete). It began to rain so heavily at about 6 in the evoning of the 5th that it was resolved to postpone the illumination until the weather should become more settled. In a recent letter it was observed that the arbitrary conduct of the employgs in Hungary was probably one of the causes of the general discontent w=ic9 prevails in that country, and a person high in office has to-day informed me that such is really the case.. The Minister of the Interior has been extremely unfortunate in the choice of some of his agents, and it may safely be foretold that there will be many changes in the administration before the Emt peror leaves Hungary. The great work of the emancipation of the Hungarian peasantry is almost complete, but Govermnent deceives itself when it fancies that the lower classes are contented with the present state of things. The tiler of the soil has ceased to be a serf, but he is so mirerably poor and so heavily taxed that he is nearly, if not quite, as disaatisfied now as he was nine or ten years ago. It is again rumoured that the Archduke William is to be appointed Governor-General of Hungary and Transylvania, instead of the Archduke Albrecht, his elder brother, with whom the climate does not agree. The Emperor will come up to Vienna on the 10th, in order to be present at the opening of the Agricultural Exhibition, but he wiUl return to Peath on the same day. When in Paris the King of Bavaria will endeavour to get the question of the successlon to the throne of Greece definitively settled. Negotiations on the subject have been going on for some time between the great Powers, but they have not yet been able to come to an understanding. King Maximilian will land at Marseilles in a day or t*o, and go by way of Lyons to Paris. It is rumoured that His Majesty will also visit England, but nothing positive is here known on the subject. The fall in all hinds of Austrian stock has been so great during the last few weeks, that Baron Bruck has considered it necessary to inform the public that none of the new rallroad companiesEast GaUician, West Bohemian, Croatian, and Carinthian-will issue their shares before the end of the year 1857. If this official communication had been made five or six months ago. it might perhaps have produced a favourable impression on the speculators, but at present they are so thoroughly disheartened that one and all of them are " bears," and are likely to remain so for many a long day to come. The Credit Bank has undertaken to advance the necessary funds for carrying on the railroads in question, until it shall appear advisable to make a call on the subscribers. On the 2d there were races on the Broghiere di Senago, near Milan. Some 40,000 persons were collected on the racecourse, and abolut 3,000 equlpages, of which no fewer than 56 were drawn by four horses. Several of the nobles passed the evening, in the Imperial Palace at Monza, where preparations had been made for their reception by the GovernorGeneral. The guests were invited by his Imperial lighness to be p resent at a French play, which was to be performed in the palace on the following evening by the company of M. IMeynadier. The Ancona corresp,ondent cf the Trstei- Zeifung writes that an assssin was arrested in the morning of the 27th of April, after he had stabbed a saddler in the chest. As the murderer was running away a corporal seized him, but loosened his hold after two blows had been dealt him with a dagger. The felow was, however, caught by the passers-by, and proved to be a day labourer named Anibale Marciani. He was imrmediately brought before a drumhead court and condemned to death. Just before he was shot, Marciani confessed that he had committed one murder and made four attempts at assassination. The poor saddler, who has a large family, is dangerously wounded. There was another panic on'Change to-day, and Credit Bank shares fell from 235 to 229. MSAY 8. Subjoined is an analysis of the State Balaneesheet for the Administration's year* 1856 - " The ordinary receipts were :-1. Direct taxes, 92,131,812fl. 2. Indirect taxes, 148,885,459f1. 3. Revenue arising from State property, 9,506,159fl. 4. Surplus of sinking fund, 10,088,692fl. Divers receipts, 7,896,6741l. Total amount of ordinary receipts, 268,508,796fl. "As the extraordinary receipts were 4,653,480fl., the total revenue during the year 1856 was 273,162,276fl., being 9,375,391fl. more than in 1855. " The ordinary e enditure was :-1. Imperial Household, 6,420,6231fn 2. Cabinet-Chancellerie' of the Emperor, 38,199fl. 3. 'MinisterConference,' 31,170fD. 4. Council of Empira and Archives, 177,39111. 5.

Interest of national debt, 88,032,65011 Total of ordinary expenditure, 321,377,664f1. "As the extraordinary expenditure (for the army) was 14,138,279fl., the total outlay dtuing the year 1856 was 335,515,943fl., being 67,170,2399. less than in 1855. On subtracting the total revenue of 273,162,276fl. from the total expenditure of 335,515,943fl., it will be found that on tho 31st of October, 1856, there was a deficit of 62,353,66711. " During the year 1856 the State received the following 'extraordinary supplies :'-I. Increase of the consolidated debt, 113,035,06911. 2. Increase of floating or non-consolidated debt, 4,442,385fl. 3. Payment for railroads cold, 18,967,98391. 4. Surplus of the funsd for the emancipation of the soil in the Slavo-werman Crown lands, with the exception of Gallicis, 7,910,985fl.; advances on the indemnification for the emancipation of the soil repaid by the other Crown lands, 2,840,185fl. ; sams taken from the Treasury, 3,473,658f9.; the totalamount of the extraordinary supplies, which was 150,670,2651, was thus employed :-. To cover the deficit, 62,353,667fl. 2. To redeem State paper-money, 3,674,3109l. 3. To repay the National Bank, 36,821,9701fl. 4. So-called Da-indemnifica. E tion, 160,6471. 5.

As the Vienna moneyed world fully believed the deficit for the year 1856 would be between 120,000,O0fl. and 125O00,OOofl., it is most agreeably surprised to find that it is so much smaller. In 3 85the deficitwas 138,899,297fl., butin thatyearin which the total revenue was 263,786,885fl.-the outlay for the army was 216,041,832fl. In 1856 it was 123,833,837fl., which is 92,207,995fl. less than it was in the preceding year. As tbe deficit for the last year is some 63,000,000fl. (6,300,0001.) less than was expected, Governmeat stock ought to rise; but the Vienna stock-jobbers are such an unreasonable race that it would not much surprise me shoald I have to inform you that National Loan scrip was lower on 'Change to-day than it was yesterday. To the great annoyance of the Minister of Finances, the Board of the Credit Bank the day before yesterday resolved to leave the new railraod shares to their fate. Since the month of September last the Credit Bank has manipulated so as to keep the above-mentioned stock above par; but it has grown tired of such Sisyphus labour, and is determined no longer to make ' ducks and drakes' of the money of the shareholders. The Minister of Finances treats the Credit Bank as though it had been created solely to serve State purposes; and not many months have elapsed since he attempted to force it to take Carinthia Railroad shares to the amount of 15,000,000fl. Government guarantees 5 per cent. interest to all the newly conceded railroads : but the Carinthia line is no more likely to pay a respectable dividend than is the Russian railroad which is to be constructed from Moscow across the Putrid Sea to TheodoBia. PRUSSIA. (FROa OUR OWWN COnESPOiDNT.) BERLIN, M&Y 9. Prince Napoleon arrived here yesterday evening about half-an-hour after the appointed time, 5 o'clock. He was received at the railway terminus here by Prince George, second cousin of the King, who presented him to Prince Augustus of Wurtemberg, Prince William of Baden, and the various Generals of the garrison thenpresent. The Marquis de Moustier, the French Minister here, and the whole personnlel of the French Mison,wvere of course present, and a guard of honour, consisting of 30 men, was drawn up by the side of the waiting-room of the station. A Royal railway carriage had been sent forward a few days previously to meet the Prince at Aix-la-Chapelle, where also a member of the French Mission here, and also Lieutenant-General von Brandt and Major von Triskow, who have been appointed to wait on him during his stay here, subsequently proceeded. After passing the night at Cologne, the Prince came on yesterday incognito to Magdeburg, where he was officially received; and, what was doubtless more satisfactory to him, luncheon was served him in the Royal carriage. The presentation at this terminus consisted of the Prince's alighting from the carriage, and, after being introduced to the officers of the highest rank, walking about the perron with his hat off as if to cool himself, while the Prussian officers on all side saluted in the usual stiff Prussian manner. A few steps taken in the direction of the unhappy-looking 30 men and two drummers, drawn up at a little distance, composed (what is called in the official accounts of such things) the inspection of the Guard of Honour. His Imperial Highness, whose good-natured obesity contrasted very favourably with the appearance of the Prussian officers, drove off with Prince George in an open carriage and six: through the Brandenburger Thor, down the Linden Avenue, to the Royal Schloss. It must not be emitted that the persons assembled at the terminus, and the company which lined the street between these and the palace, made to some extent that peculiar noise with their throats which here passes for cheering; this is doubly remarkable, since the Prussians are not disposed to strain their lungs with uttering any sound at all loud; and since any bearer of the name of Napoleon might fairly expect to be greeted here, instead of with cheers, with "curses not loud bat deep." It must be borne in mind that this is the first time since Napoleon I. left Berlin in the course of his victorious campaigns that any one of that name has ventured to show himself in Prussia. Two causes, in addition to the soothing influence of time, have tended of late to soften down the acrimony still felt towards the French for their conduct in this capital and country from 1806 to 1813. First, the very judicious conduct of the Emperor Louis Napoleon towards this country since the conclusion of the war, and the reception lately given to Prince Freerick William at Paris. The visit of Prince Napoleon to Berlin must be locked on as the return of that visit. The apartments assigned to Prince Napoleon in the Royal Schloss look in part on to the Lust Garten, andin part on to the Schloss Freiheit. The Berliners, who are fond enough of recurring to the period of the occupation of their capital by the French, maintain that they are the same as his uncle took possession of when he resided there as conqueror. The Prince's suite consists of General Salles, Colonel Bertrand, Commander Pisadi, and Captain Waldner. After spending a short time at the Opera-house last night with the King and Queen alone in their private box, the Prince returned with his Royal entertainers to the Palace to supper. As everybody will be anxious to have a satisfactory reason given them why this visit should have been paid just at this moment, and everybody, probably, will not be satisfied with being told that it is only paid in return for Prince Frederick William's visit to Paris last autumn, I will add, that it seems very probable also that the same Prince Napoleon wvil be deputed to return the Grand Duke Constantine's visit in St. Petersburg very soon, and, therefore, that he hastened to pay this visit to Berlin at once, and expressly in order not to put the slight upon the King of Prussia of coming to his capital only on his way to another. Those who are not satisfied with the two reasons assigned above can take their selection from the following, which are all current here :-He has come to settle the last difficulties connected with the Neuchbtel affair; he has come to arrange a subsequent meeting between the two Emperors of France and Rusaia (of the former, we know that all idea of his visiting Prussia has been given up, and that the latter fiads it impossible to leave his own dominions at presnt); he is anxious to get out of the Grand Duke Constantine's way at Paris; and, fourthly, he want3 to marry a niece of the Grand Duke, and therefore has left the capital where the lady's uncle is staying to visit one which the lady's brothers have just left. He will, however, leave here again on Tuesday next, as it is said, on account of a visit the King of Bavaria is about to pay to Paris. The parade which has taken place this morning unter den Linden, in honour of the Imperial guest, comprised the whole garrison of Berlin, and was as brilhant as tasteful uniforms, handsome appointments, and a bright springsun oould malke it. The troops consisted of the 2d Regiment of Foot Guards, the Kaiser Alexander and the Kaiser Franz Regiments, the Regiment of Jiagers, and the Military Osaets. The troops were headed, as they defilod before the King and Prince Napoleon, by a troop of mounted Gendarmes, and followed by the Regiment of the Garde du Corps (white uniforms, silver cuirae and silver helmets, with silver eagle perched on the crest), a regiment of Dragoons, ditto JLancers, ditto Artillery. The Prince, who when walking, and without his hat, looks a portly person and forcibly reminds one of the lateEmperor, looks unmanageably fat and highshouldered on horseback, and does not byany means ride so elegantly and so dashingly as his cousin, the Emperor. The ceremonial observed to-day was considerably more simple, and in severalrespects dif. ferent from that observed at the late viBitS of the Emperors of Austria and Russia. At this latter the King came with his staff first upon the ground (the open spase opposite the Operahouse), and took up his station at the foot of the monument of Frederick the Great, and when h's Imperial nephew appeared he rode to meet him iu the centre, where the two Monarchs saluted each other by lowering their swords, by shaking hands, and by the King's presenting the muster-roll of his troops. To-day the guest rode side by side with his host from the Palace along the front of the infantry drawn up on the south side of the Linden Avenue and, after inting the artfillery parked on the opem ground within the Brandenburg Gate, returned along the north side,where thecavalrywas drawnup.Agin, the station for the troops to defile past the so-caled saluing-pot was not chosen as on other ocsadoux, so that the whole3 brilliant cortge of King, gueat, and staff turned their backs upon the statues ci 3Blueher, York, and Gneisenau; but the King and the Prince, with their joint suites, faced westwards, so as to have those heroes of the latewar of liberation always before them. The deviation may have been accidental, but to one uninitiated in the secrets of courtly and military ceremony it could hardly fail to be striking. After the parade to-day there was a grand dinner at the Palace, and in the evening there is to be a gala performance at the Opera-house. On this occasion, as on that of the marriage of the Princess Louisa with the Grand Duke of Baden, Spontinis opera of Remanax Cortez has been chosen, On Monday the same amusement of reviewing troops is to be gone through at Potsdam, after which the whole party is to dine at Sans Souci. NAPLES. (EROM OUR OWN CORRMESPONDEnT.) NAPLES, MAY 4. The state of disorganization into which this Government has fallen, acting, asit could nototherie than do, mostgravely on the interests of the country, has also filled the relatives of the King with great alarm. It was generally said and believed some months since that they made a united protest to His Majesty, whom they conjured to place the governmsiet of the country ona different footing. They alleged that the actual system had excited the disa pprobation of foreign Powers, the dissatisfaction of tne country, and that it threatened every member of the Royal Family vwith a sad catastrophe. It was added that the King, who is well informed of the state of thinga, in order to calm the alarm of his relatives, made them suppose that he wouldchange the actual Ministry. In consequence of the bopes thus held out, the Royal Princes thought it as well to consult some person of great repute in the country, and Prince Satriano (General Filangieri) was requestednot to refuse his counsels, in case of their being demanded. Satriano, as every one who values his honour and independence must have done, refused, alleging as reasons his weak health, his age, and other plausible motives. Prince Satriano understood better than the RoyalPrincesthatttherewasno real intention of such a change as was hinted at, and that if by accident it were made it would be only to acquire blind instruments of an absolute will, or, in the contrary case, to drive them away with ignominy, as has been done at other times when an independent remonstrance was made. I am now informed that on the return of his Royal Highness the Count of Syracuse from the Papal States and from Tuscany, where he has had many speaking proofs of the contempt into whichthe Neapolitan Government has fallen, another and much more vigorous attack was made upon His MIajesty by the Royal Princes. The Kling, it is added, replied that he well knew that not only he but they, even to the last of his family, had nothing more to hope for from this country; that he was so convinced of this that he felt that any change in the system or in persons would only accelerate his fall, and with it the loss of honour and reputation; and he begged them once and for ever to beleve that if he resigned himself to the first part of his misfortune he would never fail in constancy of purpose and resolution. I am informed that the Royal Princes were far from being convinced by a mode of reasoning which, if verified, would ultimately most materially affect their interests, and that a very animated discussion arose. In fact, it is affirmed that the Count of Syracuse, meeting in the salons of the Palace of Caserta with the members of the actual Council of His Majesty, directed some warm expressions to them in a body, reproving them for their bad system of administration, for the little honesty which they evinced in their mode of serving the King and in concealng the real wants and exigencies of the country. One of the Directors (for Ministers do not exist), the Director of Grace and Justice, replied to these warm remonstrances. He ingenuously confessed that the King would see and direct everything for himself, and that even on the few occasions when they had been interrogated as to their opinions, they had never been permitted to give them with that honour and truth which their consciences dictated. Those observations irritated yet more the Royal Prince, who proceeded to say that despotism had arrved at such a point that, under the pretext and accusation of " Progressisti," peaceable menwere persecuted, and those who alone could reflect lustre and honour on the country. Upon this another person, not of the Council of State, but of the Camarilla, interposed. He expressed his wonder that a Prince of the bloodlshould elevate himself to be the protector of progress and of " Progressisti," whose principles tended but to drive the King from his throne and the Princes from their palaces to reduce them to the rank of private suppliants. He added that all Sovereigns ought to form a strict alliance among themselves, in order to destroy this sect of men, withour regarding the means. The Prince did not restrain himself from inveighing againstsuchhorrid sentiments, and, indulging in strong expressons against the Camarilla, left him hastily. Sucb, I am assured, is a faithful report of what hashappened in the Royal Palace with regard to public affairs. The reports which have been flying about for the last six months would fully justify a belief in the truth of the tirstpart of the statement, and facts go far to corroborate the latter part. My source of information is good, and, unless greatly in error, the details nowgiven gofarto confirm what I asserted last year, that the King will not change his system of Government, and that rather than do so he is ready to abandon his kIngdom at the first act of violence from whatever direction it may come, and retire perhaps into Germany. The above statement I do not asert, but believe to be true. Robberies with violence to the person have been much more frequent of late. One sad case occurred a few evenings since in the Riviera di Chiaja. Such acts were predicted on occasion of the publication of the thieves amnesty at the time of the confinement of the Queen. The policy of the Government is to keep in chains or imprisonment men guilty of thought, and to loosen the common thief. Our streets are filled with beggars by day, who play the part of thieves at night. The police does not molest them, but reserves its wrath for those who are innocent of everything but praying for the prosperity of their country. The case to which I alluded above is that of a young Englishman who was taking a strol through the Riviera di Chiaja last Wednesday night. On a sudden he was attacked by a man, whomhe knocked down; two or three other ruffians then came up, but were knocked down or driven off not, however, before thev had inflicted a wound with a knife upon the temporal -artery and kicked the Englishman severely in the side. He now lies in imminent danger, and prayers were offeredcup for his recovery yesterday morning. This is one of many similar cases which have occurred lately, one of which I reported to you. In that case I saw the knife which had been wrested from the hand of the assassin; its point was turned by striking against a case in the breast pocket. Vesuvius is now in as%tate of active eruption, and the spectacle by night is very grand. Five per Cents., 110; exchange on London, 543. The English gentleman to whom I have alluded sdightly better this morning. Every effort is being made by the authorities to discover the SARDINIA. A telegraphic despateh from Turin announces that in its sitting of the 8th inst. the Sardinian Chamber of Deputies adopted, by a majority of 94 Totes against 52, the bill ordering the transfer of the navral arsenals from Genoa to Spezzia. SPAIN. (noX OUR owN coRsP!OWDITr.) MADRID, MiT 6. The Carlist newspaper, La Begeneracion, lately threw out obscure and repeated hints of important results and changes that might be anticipated from the arrival at Madrid of the Russian Envoy-Extraordinary, Prlnce Galitzin. The signification of these inuendoes may be found in certain intrigues that have been actively arried on .to bring about the abdication of the present Queen, and the accession of the Princess of the turias, who was to be married to a son of Don Juan de Borbon, brother of MIontemolin. Many persons of influence and very high position, not only in Spain, but in other countries, and especially in Itlly and Rumia, espoused this project, and worked for its realization. Its discovery is owing to a singular piece of imprudence on the part of certain Roman Cardinals. These dignitaries| Wit apes, who I warmly intbrested themael,es in the plot, thought itpossible that Queen Christina, disgusted at the treatmxent ihe had received at the handc of the Spanish Constitution ) might be in4uwed to pTho so-called Adminish%fionsya' begins oni the ist or November and ends on the 31A of October. + Landeminum is the money paid for a Eet to the speior join in it, and they broached th, subject to her during her stay at Rome. She listened, gave no cpinion, and said she would reflect and investigate. The negotiation remained for some timein this state the Dowager Queen apparently undecided, when at ]ast she asked to see the documents relating to the affair, in order that she might learn who the per. sons were who supported it, and come to a final decision. It is presumable that she allowed the Roman politicians to entertain hopes of her adhle. sion; but, at anyrate, they, withsingular absence of caution, and utter forgetfulness of her well-acquired reputation for wariness and cunning, placed the documents in her hands. When they came to receive them back, and to ask her resolution, she threw off the mask of indecision, and asked, doubtless with some scorn, how they could suppose for a moment that she, -who had passed her life in combating Don Carlos, his heirs, and their pretensions, would consent to aid in undoing all that she had done. It gave her, she said, an extremely poor opinion of their acuteness and ability as politicians that they should imagine her capable of such Self-contradiction, and invite her to join in such a plot. The conspirators, disappointed and abashed, then asked for the documents they had intrusted to her for perusal, but sho replied that they were no longer in her possession. Thisdinouemnenttookplace three days before her departure from Rome. The documents had been sent to the Spanish Government. Amongst them were six letters from Queen Isabella's husband, Don Francisco de Assis, in which that singular personage, whose Absolutist and (inconceivable as it may appear) even Carlist tendencies are no secret, gives his entire adhesion to the plot, and expresses his belief that he shall be able to make the Queen abdicate. These most important papers, of course, received the immediate attention of Marshal Narvaez and his colleagues. They were communicated to the Queen, and became the subject of grave deliberations. The King was summoned before the Council of Ministers, and his letters were exhibited to him. He was told that he had rendered himself guilty of high treason, and that the Queen's advisers had but to apply to the Cortes, with the proofs in their posession, for him to be brought immediately to trial. 1He was warned, therefore, thathe had better be more circumspectin his conduct, abstain from intrigues, and behave himself well, or he might exposehimself to very uapleasant contingencies. In slhort, the matter will not be proceeded with, but the letters remain suspended in teroreni over his head, warning him to desist from his Absolutist schemes, and, if he values his own safety and position, to give les trouble than he for a long time past has done. The French Government having been made aoquainted with the circumstances of the plot-whether by Queen Christina or from anotber source I am unable to state-Count Walewsld and Marshal Serrano had along interview on thesubject. It ispresumable that, the Spanish and French Governments being thus informed and on their guard, Prince Galitzii will find little facility for prosecuting the schemes with the conduct of which he is charged, or, at least, the progress and realization of which there can be no reasonable doubt that he is instructed to favour and facilitate. The Three per Cents. were done at 40.20; ditto, Deferred, 25.95.

The sinister reports, however, which were current in sporting circles were either greatly exaggerated or had very little foundation on truth.

Swindells, whose account on paper looked very formidable; but "the true joy is when the money comes," and the absence of some and the neglect of others to send in their accounts caused a large balance to stand overon the debit side. The contemplated advertising of the names of the persons indebted,after the style of the forfeit list in the Shet Cakndar weill doubtless have the effect of inducing tardy settlers to display a little more activity in closing their accounts.

We regret to announce the decease of VicoAdmiral Lord Radstock, C.B., which melancholy event took place at his town residence, 26, Portland-place, yesterday (Monday) morning, shortly before 9 o'clock. The deceasd lord was the eldest and surviving son of the first Baron Radstock. He was born in 1786, and at an early age adopted the profession of his father, the Royal navy. Asa young midshipman he was active and zealous, and had many important charges in gunboat attacks oommittdto his care. He afterwards specially distinguished himself in the engagements off the Italian coast, and assisted at the destruction of the batteries at the mouth of the Rhone in 1812. He was subsequently appointed naval aide-de-camp to Her Msjesty, and was made a Companion of the Bath. During latter years he was well known in the metrepo2is for his charitable disposition, and his presence will ioIg be missed at the boards of some of the leading societies. On Friday he attended as usual at the council of King's College during the distribution of the prizes. On Saturday be was suddenly taken unwell, and rapidy sank. His father was the ounger brother of George, fourth Earl of Waldegrave, who for his distinguished services in command of the British fleet off Cape Lagos in 1797, was created a Per, under the title of Baron Radstock.

THE UNITED STATE : . , -S (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPON?DVI2. I NEW YORK. Am; 29' Winter still lingers in the lap of spring throul,h. out the Northern States, a-ad that respectable person, " the oldest inhabitant," declares again that such a season never was known before. This year he has more than usual foundation for hisgrumbling. Whether it be the coining comet, or the new Adm!nistration,-which is, of course, held responsible for everything by its opponents,-or the rotation iof the political guillotine, which decapitates full-fed office-holders to make way for lean andhungary office-seekers, or expiring Filibuaterism in Central America, or be the cause what it may, certainly a more positively disagreeable spring was never known here. Withinthepsatweek theointerior of Ner York, and the whole of New England, has been visited by two more Arctic falls of snow, block2flgnp communication for the while, and making it necessary in some places to dig out the 4oors for egress to the prisoned inhabitants. The wind comes down cold and biting from these extemporized glaciers, whirling the dust in columns and eddies through the streets, and making everybody as uncomfortable as posible. In spite of all this, shorloving New Yor finds time for parades. BogdIe the regular militia of the city, numbering sev.eral thousands, organized into corps, mustereda -i-ito the service, and officered by Amerien patur6A, glowing with gold, there is an esoteric force of citizen volunteers, or target shooters, some 6,000 or 8,000 in all, who are in the habit of parading Broadway in the autumn with bands of brazen music, greatly disproportioned to their own numbers, to the discontent of omnibus drivers and peaceable citizens. These irregular forces determined to celebrate the battle of Lexington by a united parade. But unfortunately when tho. day came, the wind blew a fearful gale and the rain fell in torrents, so that the show had to be postponed1to a more propitious day. By a curious coincidence the day selected was St. George's day-and accordingly the patron Saint of England was greeted in the Nei World by a. semi-military displayin honour of the first skirmish, of the American Revolution. He had his revenge, however, the lme evening at the annive dinner of the St. George's Society, where Lord Napier, in an adri. rable speech, told his audience, amid cheers, "How, Lord Palmerston and the people of Englands&re animatedwithgoodwillUtowards theUnitedStatef's-It was agracefulspeech, and gracefully received both b the small audience that listenedto it, and the greater audience that read it the next morning in the daily journals. The New Minister proclaims his employment to be that of holding aloft the-ensigns of peace and friendship between thetwogreat bfanche3 of the English race, and declares officially that nothing but a cordial and friendly disposition towards this country animates the Government and the community of Great Britain. Still further, he says he desires more than cordiality-he desires co-operation. He proposes no alliance hosile to American policy, no written engagements not founded -in mutualUgood Will and unity of purpose; no "entangling alliance" except the alliance of the aubimarine cable between Liverpool and New York. And-he assures both audiences that these sentiments have been careftully impressed upon him not only by Lord Clarendon, but by "that noble Viscount who) is first in the councils and first in the hearts of' the British people." I believe that these sentiments, so well expressed, particularly well for this latitude (for someoftheflightsarequiteAmericanintheirboldness), are fully responded to by those who move and direct public opinion here. Nothing could be more explicit than the Minister's declaration of the indifference, or rather the satisfaction with which Great Britaxnlooksuponthegrosth of her best customer:- "The peaceful and legitimate expansion of the United States is a matter of satistaction and pride to every English. man. Thhat expansion affords the best resort a id reli:. to o.r superabundant population; it forms the best marike for our Incroasiig industry; it is the tridmph of ourlabour, and our art, of our language, our religion, and our bloo,d:. Young America expresses Hts unqualified satisfaction with these sentiments. The new Administration, elected on the expansion " platform," is,; it seems, to meet with no check from abroad. Of the wisdom of such views, however, there can be bat one opinion among those who are acquainted with the politics of the United States. While Lord Napier was preaching foreign indifference to Filibustering (judiciously arranged, that is, for territorial expansion) the late Attomey-General, Mr.Cushing, the hero of the enlistment controversy, was telling the Abolitionists of Massachusetts that they ought to give up their prejudices and joia in a universal crusade for the accomplishment of the " manifest destiny" of the Inited States. Walker he repudiates,- " Non tali auxilio, nec defenseoribus istis " Tempus egetL' But Central America he is quite willing to have " If rivers run acroes our path we will bridge them if mountains rise up to stop us we will tunnel them; if deserts appear we will reclsim and cultivate them; if oceans inter. vene we will navigate them; to which lut end, so long as there's an oak left on earth, gdlant ahips shall continue to be launched into the -waters of this our Merrimac." The mercurial and elastic statesman, even in his retirement, cannot forget his old battles. He fights them o'er again with his neighbours and friends on the banks of the Merriinac in the true spirit of a veteran. " I glory," he says, " In the acts whnich it has fallen to me to perform towards the repression of all such undertakings in the United States, whether on the part of a presumptuous British Minister, recruiting troopa within our jurisdiction for the purpose of warfare in the Crimea, or of a reckless American adventurer, recruiting them for the purpose of plunder and murder in Nicargua" The city and the State authorities are in direct conflict for the possession of the police. This force was used during the last election to advance the political purposes of those who had the control over it-or at least it was supposed to be so used. Consequently, the State Legislature, which is opposed politically to the city authorities, enacted a Bill for the entire reorganization of the force-creating in lieu of a mere city police a metropolitan corps as in London. When it is considered that, out of rather more than a million who now compose this metropolis, probably at least onefourth reside without the corporate limitE, the expediency of such a change, independently of political considerations, is manifest. But no one likes to par with power, still less where the power iBsEO great as the control of a large and well drilled force. The new lawr is resisted, the city refuses to surrender the control of its police to the Metropolitan Board, and theinterposition of the Courts is asked to restrain the latter from entering upon their duties. One judge and then another gr.4 injunctions for this purpose, and the most eminent counsel of New York are now spending their days arguing the constitutional right of the State of New York to interfere with the police of the city. It is claimed that the Bill is a violation of the constitation by placing officers named by executive appointment over a body created for municipal purpos-that the people themselves have the constitutional right to elect their own offiicers. The principle of electing officers has been carried further ithis State than in any otber community of the same si Almost every offlce is elective. The wisdom of such a course with the office of head of the police hu been doubted, and hence the present law-the first step backward toward the old state of things-hence, too, the force of the resistance. The aid of the fundamental law of the State, which is to override all legisUtion, is called in. Meanwhile the power remains in the old hands, and to all appeaances may stay there for a long tinie to come. The same Legislature has enated a new excise .law, to take the pace of the old prohibitory (or Maine liquor) law, pronounced unconstitutional. T}is, too, is to be resisted by those affected by it, as are also two or three other laws changing the tenure of power and the enjoyment of emoluments This is one of, the great advantages of a fundamental arw that may never be infringed-almost any legis - lation may be pared and pruned away by ingenious refining; And meanwhile the objectors preserve the old state of things. Tfhe news from Central America is of the usual uncertain character. Walker is represeAted as well supplied with provisions, and likely to hold out - he baa been in a critical state so long that one may now believe anything of him.

MON AY-ABRRRTandCITYINTELLIGBENCR. Monday Evening. The funds opened this morning with a buoyant appearance at the improved quotations of Saturday, but subsequently experienced a slight reaction. The first transactions in Consols for money were at 934 to 4, whence they soon advanced to 94. This further rise, however, induced several sales, and a fall occurred to 93g, the final prices being, 938- to i for money and 94k to J for the 4th of June. The principal operations consisted of a sale of 100,0001. Reduced for delivery, and' a speculative purchase for the Consol account of about a similar sum. The rate for advances on Govern. ment securities was from 6i; to 7 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 211 to 213 ; Reduced, 921 to i; New Three per Cents., 924 to a ; India Stock, 220 to 222; India-bonds, 8s. to 4s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to i-; and Exchequer-bil (June), 2s. discount to par; (March), par to 3s. premium. In the discount-market there was some diminution of pressure. Foreign securities opened with animation, and in some cases there was an advance. Subsequently sales produced a reaction, and a general decline was noticeable. Turkish Six per Cents. experienced considerable depreciation, and closed with heaviness. The operations were for the account at 94#, 93#, 931, and 93i. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the bargains for the account were at 100I and i; Brazilian Five per Cents., for the account, 100 and 100i ; Mexican, for money, 224; for the account, 23k; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96;l and J; Sardinian Five per Cents., for the account, 91k, 91, and 9lI; Spanish New Deferred, for account, 25k ; Spanish Certificates, 6g.; Belgian Four-and-a- Halt per Cents., 96; Dutch Two-and-aH11alf per Cents., 6(5; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 9, The corn-market was heavy this morning, and sales could not be effected except at a decline of 2s. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 69f. 25c. for money, showing an advance of an eighth. The general appearance of~ the foreign exchanges continues favourable. A further sum of about 24,0001. Australian gold was taken to the Bank to-day. The commercial advices from New York this week show an active stock-market, with a tendency in Eome cases to improvement. Erie Railway, however, had declined to 41; New York Central 'was quoted 87i; Reading, 82 to i; Panama, 93; and Illinois Central, 34, pm.-the bonds, 99i. Owing to the increasing belief in the approaching destruction of Walker and his band, Nicaragua Transit Company Stock, which was recently valueless, has been purchased at G. The statement by the last steamer, that bonds of the Panama Railway for 225,0001. had just been negotiated in London, proves to have been incorrect. They were sent here for negotiation, but were not taken up. A Connecticut paper, referring to the recent failure of the Great Western Railway of Illinois, immediately after the completion of the line, to pay the interest on their first mortgage bonds, consisting of 270,0001. of 7 per cents., and 200,0001. of 10 per cents., a portion of which are held in England, denounces it as the most disgraceful act of railroad repudiation which has ever taken place in America. The bondholders cannot foreclose under a year, and it is asserted that the object is to take advantage of that time. The tendency of the rate of exchange continued favourable for this country, and of the 206,0001. brought to Europe by the present packet about half will probably remain here. Although remittances were now likely to be made by each steamer, it was thought the drain would be fully met by receipts from the interior and the Californian deliveries, especially as the absorption of coin by the Federal Treasury for Customs' duties would be light until the reduction of the tariff in July. The reports of the trade of the manufacturing towns during the past week show no alteration. At MIanchester the dalness has been increased by the firmness of the Liverpool cotton-market, which further diminishes the relative profit on manufactured goods and induces a limitation of production. The Birmingham accounts describe steadiness in the iron trade, and confidence with regard to its prospects. For the general manufactures of the place the foreign and colonial orders are in most cases vatisfaotory5, and there is also a fair home demand. In the woollen districts there has been a slight increase of activity, and the Irish linen-marketi are without change. At the first meeting of the T2uIT.y Mutual Banking Company, held to-day, Mr. SheritMlfechi presiding, the report and accounts, after someMdiscussion, were unanimously adopted, and interest at the rate of 3 per cent. was declared on the payments made on shares to the 1st of May, 1856. Pamsages of the report which referred to the abandonment of branches, the reduction of expenses, aud the cessation of the connexion with Mr. T. H. Baylis, met with much approval. Great dissatisfaction, how- ever, was expressed when the detail of preliminary I expenses was entered into, the appropriation of 6,0001. to the late managing director exciting severe comments. The auditors' report, from its fulness of detail appeared to give satisfaction. The chairman in his opening address alluded to the formation of the bank, the subscription of the capital, -which wuas faithfully paid and deposited in the London and Westminster Bank, and the successful progress in the early commencement of business. The failure of the Royal British Bank and the want of confidence created by that disastrous event at once turned the tide. During the first four months the amount of deposits had steadily increased, until a max,nu?n of 242,0001. was attained, and in that period the profits realized had been about 9,0001. The day before the Royal British Bank failed they stood in this favourable position. Very shortly the deposits decreased 100,0001., and such was the panic tbat not only shareholders and customers dre v out their funds, but the former rushed into the market to relieve themselves from their responsibility; and if the chairman, with some of the directors, on their own individual account, had not stepped in and purchased shares, the quotation would have gone much lower, and the whole of the money would have been drawn out. After a short suspense the deposits again show a slight increase. The Leicester-square branch was in operation at the time when the bank held their largest amount of deposits, and its busiuess contributed to produce that total; but, as the public and the shareholders have expressed an adverse opinionto an increase of branches, it is the desire of the board to discontinue those which are unprofitable, and confine operations as much as possible to the parent establishment. In future great economy will be exercised. There has been no concealment or improper patronage, and but for the preliminary outlay, which has been large, a more satisfactory balance-sheet would have been presented. A long and irregular discussion followed, and while the entire meeting gave credit to the directors for presenting a clear and honest statement, the items in the preliminary expenses for stationery, printing, and advertisements, legal and other charges, the remuneration to Mr. T. H. Baylis, commission on shares, and the opening dinner, were subject to special scrutiny. In answer to questions the chairman admitted that the expenditure in the formation of the bank had been excessive. The concern, however, was in course of organzation sorne months before several of the directors, himself, and the present manager joined it. With regard to the 5901. paid for the dinner at the London Taverm, it had been attended with advantage, as it had proved the means of introducing many good customers. The amount of overdue bills included in the assets is 8,0001. or 9,0001., but the actual losses are taken at 1,1001. Some of the shareholders asserted that they were induced to subEcribe on the understanding that they were to r ceive 5 per cent. upon their payments, and they now complained that only 3 per cent. interest was fo:thcoming. Others proposed that all distribution should be postponed for the present, in order that the bank might stand in a better position before the public. Thechairmanstated thatthe shareholders will be entitled to 5 per cent., but that 3 per cent. is all tAhatcan at this moment be paid. A resolution for distributing this amount was then put and seconded, and, altjiough an amendment was moved, the proposal was carried by a majority. The report having been adopted, there was a further general conversat.on, through which additional information was elicited. Of the paid-up capital, it was stated 322,0001. is left, 88,0001. being cash. WVith the exception of advances to the chairman, which he employed in purchases of shares to arrest the decline in prices (and for which the bank held ample security, in addition to the whole of his shares and his life policies), the liabilities of ffa other dixeciorsare not zare than 1,50011 to 2,0001. Had it not been for this intervention the bank would have been placed in a most embarrassing situation, and an enormous sacrilice would have taken place. It was solely with the object of jasisting the establishment in a period of ditficulty i tbat he came forwvard, being determined, after being placed in the position of Governor, not to I desert the establishment, but to see it safely through the Crisis. One of the directors argued at length in favour of members of the Board reCeiVing similar assistance to that afforded to customers, and showed that such transactions, when legitimately conducted, were advantageous to the shareholders. Two of the retiring directors were then re-elected, and special votes of thanks were passed to the Governor, the Board, and the Manager. Annexed are the reports and accounts:- " The directors have pleasmre in submitting for approval the following balance-sheet of assets and liabilities. The difficulty attendant upon introducing the principle of mnutuality into the business of bankinig was one which could not be accomplished without considerable trouble, delay, and expense. All arrangements were completed to begin business on the Ist of January, 1856, when the Board of Trade, deeming it necessary to consult the law offlcers of the Crown as to the legality of the new principle of mutuality without responsibility on the part of the depositors, delayed the grant of the charter until the 1st of Mlay, thus entailing four months' establishment expenses on the bank before it could commence business. Great outlay was also incurred by the establishment of the following branches *- Leicester-square, Watford, St. Albans, Hertford, Ware, Brighton, and Pimlico, and the preparation for branchcs at Aldgate, Holborn, Regent-circus, and Exeter. Experience having proved that the success of these branches was doubtful, the director&have determined to close those at Watford, St. Alban;-Ware, and Pimnlico at Midsummer next. They have also declined opening branch banks which had been prepared at Aldgate, Holborn, Regent-circus, and Exeter. These circumstances have largely increased the amount which appears under the head of prelitninary expenses. The charter empowers the directors to diffuse the preliminary expenses over a period of 20 yearsL the average charge on the profits of each year will not, t erefore, exceed 1,5001. The current expenses have been considerably reduced, those for the six months ending the 30th of April, 1857, being 1,7621. less than those of the preceding half-year. At the urgent request of a large body of the bhareholders, it was determined by the Board that the connexion of Mr. T. H. Baylis with the bank should cease. Negotiations entered into for that purpose were successful. Notwithstanding the recent failures and irregularities of two metropolitan joint-stock banks, with the disgraceful exposures in conuexion with the failure of a private bank, which shook the confidence of the public in all such institutions, this bank, although suffering in common with others from those cauEes, has taken root in the commercial world. It has opened upwards of 1,400 accounts, discounted bils to the amount of 1,500,0001., on which a loss has accrued of only I,lOOZ., end, after payment of current expenses, interest on deposit and current accounts, and making deduction for bad and doubtful debts, has realized a net profit of 2,4151. It is the opinion of the directors that it 'would at present be undesirable to diminish the funds of the company by the payment of a dividend; but, as the balance admits of 3 per cent. to the shareholders upon payments made by them up to the Ist of May, 1856, it remains forthe shareholders, having all the facts before them, to determine how the surplus shall be disposed of. Frlendly communications have been established witn most of the leading bauUing firms on the Continent and India, and arrangements are in progress for the appointment of agencies in the ehief towns of Canada and the United States, for the transaction of business, and for the granting of letters of credit. At Birmingham, Manchester, and Southampton agents have been appointed to receive and transmit cash to the head office on reasonable terms, and the directors have it in contemplation to open similar agencies in other large mercantile districts. The directors suggest that the future half -yearly meetings of the bank should be held in the months of January and July, and that the books should be balanced at the usual periods, in conformity with the practice of similar establishments. The directors feel it their duty to express their unanimous conviction that this bank will succeed, and are anxious to impress upon the minds of the shareholders the facts that the business of banking is profitable, and that this bank is ably and honestly conducted; they therefore confidently urge the shareholders to recommend and expound its peculiar principle of mutuality among their friends and connexions, so as to insure its increased and permanent prosperity.

They have not only tested the accuracy of the accounts, bdt have thoroughly examined, to the best of their ability, the vouchers and securities, and consider thema to be quite satisfactory. They find that the whole of the capita of 1,0,0001. was paid into the London and Westminster Banr. These being the subjects essentiaUy involved in such an examination, the auditors feel that this report, however concise, is here technicaUy complete; but irt their capacity of shareholders they venture to add a few observations which mnay tend to satisfy the shareholders, the public mind of late having been so much disquieted by the failures nd frauds of those in whom confidence had been too unreservedly reposed. The condition of the balance-sheet is, in their opinion, owing to tbree causes :-First, the failure of the Royal British Bank, which alarmed the community and created prejudices against all new companies and joint-stock banks. Secondly, to an unnecessary and indiscreet expenditure in the preliminary outlay, and more especially by the establishment of branch banks in places where it was obvious the smaU amount of business to be transacted could not compensate for the. expenses. Thirdly, to the kupposed, butmistaken connexion between the bank and the fire and life assurance companies, and the notoriety gained by the latter in the public press in The discussions which led to the resig. nation of Mr. Baylis. It is the opinion of the auditors that the bank has passed safely through a crisis of its existence imperilled by the above causes, and that nothing is now required but a continuation of its present system of man. agement and the efforts of the sbareholders to entirely restore public confidence and insure considerable succeqss A large discount business has been transacted with a beneficial result, the losses having been extremely small. The deposit and current accounts are both of a promising character. The auditors have regarded with jealousy and suspicion loans made to directors, or any moneys received by them from the bank. They find, however, that such transactions are of a moderate character, and have been made upon the same principle as those to the customers generally. The auditors, had they met with anything in the accounts which justified their doing so, Tould have at-I once availed themselves of the services of a professional accountant. The present audit has cost them so much time and trouble that they propose for the future, with the consent of the board of director and shareholders, to examine the books once a-montb, in order to facilitate their labours at the regular half-yearly audit." The propositions of the French Government regarding the renewal and modification of the charter of the Banii of France have been officially published. The charter is to be prolonged till 1897, and the capital is to be doubled by the issue of one new share of 1,OOOf. for every share at present held. The issuing price is 1,l00f. (of which 1,000f. is to go to capital, and IOOf. to the reserve fund), and the additional sum raised will therefore be 100,375,000f. Of this amount l00,000,OOOf. are to be advanced to the Government against 3 per cent. RIentes, which are to be talken by the Bank at the price of 75f. The Bank are to be allowed to make advances on the debentures of the Cr6dit Fonc.er, as well as on Rentes and railway securities as atpresent. They are also to be allowed to add a charge for commission to theirrate for discounts and advances. It is also contemplated that they shall increase their existing advances to the Treasury of 65,OOO,OOOf. to 80,000,000f. against bonds at three months' date, such bonds not to bear interest, except whenever the may exceed the deposits of the Governm-ert held by the Bank. These conditions are precisely [similar to those already published in 17he TirneS, but it is supposed that great alterations wi be made in them. The bulk of the Mlexican dollara brought by the last packet have tbeen sold at 60id., which, as compared with the rate realized for the MLarch steamer, shows a decline of id.; considering, however, the flat state of the silver market, and tho extent of arrivals this month, prices have scarcely given way eo much as was generally anticipated. At a special meeting of the Peel River Company to-day resolutions were passed empowering the directors to alter the date of meeting and to reduce the number of auditors. The retirement of Sir Minto Farquhar took place on this occasion, and a vote of thanks for past services was agreed to. The departures from the port of London during the past week for the Australian colonies have comprised three vessels-one to Auckland, one to Ade- e, and one to Launceston-with aii aggregate capacity of 1,211 tons. The rates of freight exhibit little variation. The general business of the port of London still remains very inactive. This is owing to the easterly wind. A large number of vessels are now overdue. The total number of vessels reported inwards during the past week was 131, being 18 less than in the previous week. These include the American ship Swallow, with a cargo of 26,084 pacekages of tea. The number of ships cleared outward was 135, including 12 in ballast, showing a decrease of 19. The total number of vessels on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 47, being 5 less than at the last account. Of those now loading 4 are for Adelaide, 3 for Geelong, 3 for Hobart Town, 3 for Lauiceston, 1 for Melbourne, 4 for New Zealand, 12 for Port Phillip, 1 for Portland Bay, 15 for Sydney, and I for Swan River. Of these, 1 was entered outward in January, 2 im February, and 9 in March. The annexed information with regard to the progress of English mining adventure is condensed from the M-Ining Journal:- I IThe market opened heavily this week, but subsequently improved.

THE CORN TRADE. MARK-LANE, MoiDAy YAOOY. BAY 11. - wuue ts arrivais were altogether moderate. The ex. ports were 83 quarters of oats, 12 quarters of beans, 103 sacks of flour. Of home-grown wheat the receipts were 7,321 quarters, of foreign only 2,950 quarters. There were fair supplies this morning from Essex and Kent, and Fri day's samples not being cleared, the quautity on sale was large. This circumstance, together with a very favourable change in the weather, entirely checked the upward moverent; some early sales were made at Is. to 2s. per quarter. less money, but the bulk remained unsold. The short arrival of foreign sustained the prices of good samples. The arrivals of flour were almost exclusively from the country, and consisted of 18,067 sacks, including 10 sacks foreign. Friday's improvement of Is. per sack on Norfolks and ls. per barrel on American samples were maintained, the quotationis for the former being 41s. per sack. Of barley theto were only 437 quarters of home growp, with 8,005 quarters foreign. The warm weather closing the malting season, such samples were easier to buy, but the lower kinds were the turn in the seller's favour. Malt remained a steady sale at previous currency. Of Englisb oats there were 544 quarters, of Irish 3,030 quarters, and of foreign 12,102 quarters. This reduced supply enabled factors to establish an advance of fuly 6d. per quarter, but sales were slow. There were no foreign arrivals either of beans or peas. Of the former, home-grown, there were 952 quarters, of the latter only 144 quarters. Both these descriptions of corn fully supported the late advance. Of linseed tho arrivals were 330 quarters, and exports 225 quarters. Bmsiness was limited for want of stock, but rates were firm both for seed and cakes. The cloverseed season being over, prices have become nominal, with very limited stocks. Canaryseed has again somewhat advanced. Eempseed, mustardseed, and other descriptions remained without change of value. Arrivals of Corn In the Port of London, from May 4 to May 9.

LAW REPORT. aumonT m i, OTrWRN'8 RF:NCmr W1rnNRTTV MAY 11 NRZELL V. DELETREE ANT) OTTTERR jBiUtings at Mai6 Prit, before Mr. Justice W IGTmAw and Common Juries.) Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Field appeared for the plaintiff; MIr. H. Hill, QOC., and Mr. Wordsworth for the defendants. The plaintiff in this action was formerly clerk and shopman at Messrs. Aube:b and Klaftenberger's, in Regentstreet, and he sued the defendants, Messrs. Brocot and Deletree, to recover damnages for the breach of a contract hiatovrhich they had entered with the plaintiff to employ their commission agent at a shop they had opened in the clock and watch trade in MIargaret.street, Cavendish-square. It appeared from the plaintifi's evidence, and also from a correspondence which was put in, that in October, 1856, the defendanSs had engaged the plaintiff's services at a salary of 180l. a-year, payable monthly. The plaintiff was to reside rentfree on the premises in Mlargaret-street, and, in addition to his salary, he was to have l1. per cent, commission on what he sold. As soon as the agreement was concluded thy plaintiff gave Messrs. Anhert and Kiaftenberger notice to leave, but towvards the end of November, when the plaintiff was to enter on his engagement, he found that Mr. Deletree had altered his mind, and had determined to continue a Mr. Hooker, whom he previously had in his employ. The only excuse given by the defendant was that the plaintiff had not called on Mr. Hooker so frequently as the defendant thought he ought to have done, and had not bought a writing-table, which might have been got at any time in half an hour. Mr. HILL, in answer to a question from the learned judge, said, it was for the jury to decide, upon the evidence, what notice was required in this case; and he contended before the jury that, as it was proved that one month was the usual notice, the defendant had done anl that could be required of him, by paying into court the sum of 451., the amount of three months' salary. ir. Justice WIGHTMAN accordingly left the question of notice to the jury, who expressed their opinion that the agreement was not to he terminated before the end of the yrear. They accordingly awarded the plaintiff one year's salary, less the sum paid into court. Verdict for the plaintiff; damages, 1351. TAYLOR V. COX. Mr. Lush appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Phinn and lifr. Huddleston for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action Henry Taylor, was a " recti. fier," living at Brentwood, Essex, and he sued the defendant, Edmund J. Cox, an anctioneer, &c., at Birmingham, to recover damages for being given into the custody of the police and coDfined aU night in a police station. The defendant pleaded that the Plaintiff had first assaulted him in the presence of the police. It appeared that on Sunday, the 22d of February last, the plaintiff was staying at the George Hotel, Birmingham, and in the evening of that day he went into the kitchen, as it was usual for the smokers to do, and, not being attended to as promptly as he desired, he found fault with one of the maadservants, who answered him pertly. He then told her he supposed she had been out to see her sweetheart, znd not haing seen him she had come back in a bad temper. The servant, whose temper appeared to be none of the beat, retaliated. Tho plaintiff, who had taken some ale, half.a-pint of port wie, and two glasses of whiskey and water, told her she was a " cat," and this young woman was so hurt in her feel. ingsby this language thatsshe went crying toherbed. Mean. time the defendanthad come intothe kitchen, andhetookup the cause of the youDg woman. He told the plaintiffthat he' was a stranger in that house, and he had no right to insult the servant girl. What are called "high words" then paesed between the parties-that is to say, the defendant iaUed the plaintiff a I d- puppy." This brought in the police to quiet the disturbance, and the defendant told them to take the plaintiff into custody, but they refused. The defendantthen wisbed thelandlady to give the plaintiffinch'e, but as she declined the police retired, having first received a shilling from the defendant to get something to drink..After this the defendant began again, and when the police came in a second time the defendant gave the plaintiff in charge for an assault, and accompanied him to the station, where the charge was formally made. The plaintiff was then locked up tiU about 5 o'clock in the morning, when he was removed from the cell, which was excessively hot, to another lockup in the town, which was excessively cold, and there detained with the other night charges. At about 12 o'clock the next day he was taken before a magistrate, but as no one appeared against him he was discharged. Mlr. PDuINN cro -, xarained the plaintiff to saiow that his conduct bad been very violent and abusive, and that he had not only assaulted th3 defendant, but also a man naned Pettit, who was in the kitchen at the same time ; but he de- i d th tbhe had csmmitted any assault. He admitted that noon after he had been looked up some persons came to bail him out, but he refused Lo go, saying he should remain there, and make Cox, the defendant, pay for it. The landlady, tue barmaid, and the chambermaid con*rmed the plaintiff's evidence, and said that no blow was struck, and, with respect to Pettit's bla-k eye, the landlady said she had been told by Pettit that he had slipped, and bnocked his eye against the screen. Mr. PHINN then called the defendant, who proved that the plaintiff had assaulted Pettit, and had also struck him (the defendant) in the Presence of the police. He denied that he had given the police any money, but would not 3positively swear to it. Two policemen were then called, who stated that the defendant had given them a shilling, but though they saw a scuffle they could not say they saw a blow strack. Pettit was not called. Mr. Justice WIGrTmrA having summed up the evi'dence, The jury made a communication to the learned judge, which was understood to be a suggestion that the plaintiff should consent to withdraw a juror, but, as Mr. Lush declined this proposal, the jury found a verdict for the plain. tiff, with one farthing damages. THE QUEEN V. KENNEDY. When this case was caUed on, Mr. COOK EvANis (for Mr. Hawkins) said, the defendant had been charged, with two other persons, with a conspiracy. The other defendants had already been acquitted. The -defendant had been absent in India, but on his return to this country he had brought the indictment down for triaL It was understood that no evidence would be offered. Mr. Justice WIGHTMAN told the jury that, as no one appeared to give evidence, it was their duty -to acqut the defendant. The jury accordingly found him Nfot Guilfu.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, Wxs zmsT'rR. MAY 11. ICIN G V. SILBERBERG. iwuCung3 at Av&t Frius, aftkr Termr, before Jfr. Jutkce WILLIAMS and Common Iflc 4 i ms was an action of slander for imputing to the plain. tiff that he was a Thief, and also to recover salary. The defendant p leaded a justification, and also that he was justified in disc,arging thePlaintiff. Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Joyce appeared for the plaintiffand Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., for the defendant. The plaintiff, it appeared, had for several years carried ,n busmess as a tobacconist, but failed about two years ago. On the 10th of January last he entered into an agreement with the defendant, also a tobacconist, to act as his town and country traveller, at a salary of 31. per week, and 10 -per eenb. commission on the sales of cigars he effected. On tthe oth of Eebruary last, on going into the shop of the defendant, as usual, to take away the goods packed up for him, to his chaise, after commending some cigars -on the counter, he was observed, while the shopman was at another part of the shop, to take three cigars from a bundle, and put themn into his coat-pocket, and wlso some screws of tobacco. The shopmnan called down the defendant, who accused him of having taken the cigars which the plaintiff said he had taken as a sample. The defendant then said he was a "' d-d thief," and threat. ueand to send for the police, told him to go away, and discharged him. Afterwards the plaintiff begged his pardon, znd asked to be continued in his employmsent. The plain. tiff, in explanation, said it was customary for travellers in the trade not only to tako samples of cigars, but also to smoke them themselves, in order to test their quality, and contended that the cigars and screws of tobacco taken had boen taken with this object, and witnesses were called to prove this custom of the trade. They however said, that samples were placed in a drawer for the use of the travellers, and thoy had no right to take cigars from the general stock. With regard to begging the defendrnt's pardon, the plaintiff eaid he begged his pardon, if what he had done was an irregularity. His LORDSHXP having summed up the evidence The jury retired, and after being abweat foux hours the Court rose, leaving them locked up.

This was an information charging the defendan with being ces;cerned in the illegal Iaiding of uncuatomed tobacco, a=d concealing the same, on the 23d of May last, at jhotley-gpte, in the county of Sufdbik. The pleasant village of Shotley is stu-te on the point of land forfmed by the con. 11upnce of the Avers Orwell and Stour, and from that point their united wrtcrs flow in a broad body past Hlarwrich and Landgiurd Fort into the German Ocean Opposite ,folland and BelOu These waters have ever been a favourite resort or emu glers, and many a "hair-breadth 0-cape," many a deed of dzring hy them in days long gono by, cowd that veraoious, thotgh fabulous individual tkn " oldest Inhabitant " of Shotley tell if he were taken in the mood. The relaxation of the Customs' Laws of late yearshas deprived the oraft of its two great incentives-profit and risk ; but still there are some " hands apt" to be fonu d when time is fitting, who wiU lend aid to the co0etia'. bandist. Among these is the defendant Page, r.a old fellow approaching 80, and almost blind, v}.ao, whe. ther by smuggling in former times, or by other means, has contrived to put togethor a little ho ase property at Shotley. One of his cottages, near the Sihore, is mnbabited by one Samuel French, and it appeared on the testi. maony of this man and his wife that, at the request of their landlord, they had, on the night of the 2ad ot May, allowed a quantity of tobacco to be deposited in an outhouse by one W'ebber, who, 'withthether defendants, had smuggled it over from Belgium. Mrs. French also proved that the defendant Page had cautioned her "not to know anything' if anyinquiryshould happen to be made, orthey would all go to gaol. For the defendant Page it was urged that the evidenc of Mir. and Mrs. French was false, and arose from his havingthreatened to "County Court" them for his ren§, while it was strongly urged that his advanced age and in firmity utterly disquali6ed him from taking any active Dart in any such illicit tranFactions as the other defendants had, nlo doubt, been ergaged in on this occasion. Sir F. TnESx1s. in reply, said, the defence put forward by his learned friend for his client reminded him of the p!ea of the trumpeter in the fable whean taken in battle; and his answer to it would be that of the trumpeWs captors, who replied, " If you don't fight yourself you incite others to do so, and that's worse stilL" In truth, the question hero was whether any reliance could be placed on the testimony of the Frenches, and he submitted that there was no sufcient ground for imputing to them the serious offence of perjury. The jury at once returned a verdict for the Crown for the single value, 5971. Mr, Baron Martin disposed of a few common juries, and gave notice that to-morrow (this day) there would be a second court, over which Mr. Baron Bramwell would preside.
COURT FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF CROWN I CASES RESERVF.n- Mnw)AV- AIAV 11 THE_QEUEEN V. IaSTEH. AIhsD BIGGS. (Presew,-Lord CAmPBELL, the Lord Chief Justice of the CO?,MMO PLEAS, the C}iF BARON, Justices COLE =G E, CRESS WEL1, ERLE, CROMPTON, CROWDER, and WILLES, and Barons BRIwEn., WATSOF, and CHAELL . Mr. zerjeant rABRY, who appeared on behalf of the defendants, said, that they were indicted for a public nuisance in keeping and storing large quantities of wood, naphtha, and spirits of wine in Suffolk-lane, near Thames-street, to wit, 10,000 gallons of naphtha and 45.000 gallons of spirits of wine, and the indictment charged that they did deposit and cause to be deposited in a certain warehouse, near to divers streets and ancient highways, divers large quantities of dangerous and explosive fluid, called wood naphtha, and did keep the same in large and dangerous quantities, by reason whereof the subjects of the Queen passing along the highway were in great danger and peril of their lives and property. The evidence was that naphtha was more inflammablethan gunpowder, and, if inflamed, water could not put out the fire-practically, if a fire arose it could not be quenched; but the evidence was that such caution was usedthat no fire could arise. The Crown, however, contended, that to keep such dangerous articles was a public nuisance, inasmuch as fire might be incautiously introduced, or a fire arising in the adjoining premises might communicate to these premises. Baron Alderson, who tried the case, directed the jury to find the defendants guilty, reserving a point for decision by the Court for the Consideration of Crown Cases Reserved. It was argued before the five judges who composed that court,, but those judges not beingable to agree the case was ordered to be argued before the 15 Judges, the Court now assembled. The question reserved was, whether the manufacture, which was carefully carried on, was a public nuisance. The learned counsel submitted that the count upon which the conviction had taken place did not contain a statement of any offence, and that the facts disclosed did not show any offence at common law. A fear of danger was not an offence. The defendants were charged with an indictable misdemeanour; he contended that no such offence was shown. There was no offence charged known to the common law. The defendants were not shown to have done any act for which they were amenable to the criminal law. ln order to fix the defendants, it was necessary to show that the defendants did something so as to produce an injury, or had omitted to do something that it was their duty to do, which produced the same result. It was not shown that the defendants had done anything unlawful to cause any danger. The whole amount or the evidence was that they had kept a material which was highly inflammable, There was nothing else than the fear of mankind, and that was not sufficient to make an indictable offence. He contended that the conviction must be quashed. Mr. WILDE appeared for the Crown.-The question was whether the keeping such an article was not a public nuisance. The proprietors of the adjoining property were rendered, in their opinion, unsafe, for, from the evidence, if any fire should take place, it would be equal to the old fire of London. The very fact of no light or fire being allowed to be talken into the premises was of itself sufficient to show the danger the defendants apprehended. The least act of want of caution would produce the danger, and it was impossible to say what might take place in the adjoining premises. The ager here was to the whole neighbourhood. He trusted the conviction would be affirmed. Mr. Serjeant PARRY, in reply, said that a great portion of the trade of London would be put a stop to should this conviction be affirmed-muslins and articles of that kind. The COURT.-Water would not put it out M r. Serjeant PARny.-If they brought a sufficient quanthe COURT.-Piactically, the fire could not be quenched. Mr. Serjeant PARRY.-PracticalUy was too vague a term for a criminal offence. If fireworks were made carelessly the manufacture might be a common nuisance. There wau not a portion of the city where inflamniable articles were not to be found. Lord CARBELL said, the learned counsel would frighten them. Mr. Serjeant PARiy said, that would be a di'dicult thing. it was not because there might be danger that parties were to be indicted. Mr. Justice EBRL.-The manufacture, as carried on, produced no danger. It was only by the act of a wrongdoer that danger might be caused. The CHiEr BARON alluded to the case of a batt of beer bursting at Meux's some years since, when men were drowned. Lord CAmrPEELL.-And it might be said they were fonund floating on their watery bier. The UOURT took time to consider. THE QUEEN V. SHERWOOD. This was a case reserved by Mr. Justice Wille. It was a case of false pretence as to the quantity of coals sold, the prisoner stating them to weigh 18 cwt., whereas they were only 14 owt. The question was whether this amounted to a false pretence. Mr. POWELL appeared for the prlsoner. It was more in the nature of a breach of warranty than a false pretence, The contract was for a load of coaL, Lord CAEPBELL.-The prisoner representing it to be 18 owt., at so much per cwt., and he receivedthe money for the 18 cwt., when there were but 14 cwt. Mr. POWELL.-The load of coal was the contract. Lord CAmrBnEL.-The prisoner professed to sell her 18 cwt. Mr. POWELL said, if he received 51. to go to York, and did not go to York ? Lord CASPBELL.-YOu need not labour that-it is something antecedent. Mr. IM'Mahon appeared for the prosecution, but was not heard. Lord CAMPEELL said, he could not feel any doubt upon this case that it came clearly within the words of the statute. The prisoner represented the weight to be 18 owt., he well knowing it to be only 14 cwlt, and said he had actually seen the coals w eighed at the colliery, and he pro. .iuced a ticket, and thereupon he received the money for the 18 cwt. apon this fraudulent misrepresentation. IIe had received this mioney, and he had obtained it by false pretences wvith intent to cheat and defraud the party to whom he sold The other judges all concurred. Conviction affirmed. TEZ QUEEN V. BRYAN. This was a case reserved by the Recorder of London, and was another case of false pretences. The prisoner had represented certain spoons to be of the best quality. equal to ".Elkihngton's best A,." The spoons were offered by way of pledge and money obtained upon them, but they were worthless. Mr. ROBINSON appeared for the prisoner, and urged that this was only a tradtsman's lie, and was merely a puffing of the goods. Anuy tradesman might be indicted for a mirepresentation as to his goods. drin thNes appearnd on the part of the prosecution. Thiwas a miBsrpresentation as to the quantity of slver, as Elkinhton's spoons were knewn to contain a certain quan. tityo o ws rttetal. The pawnbroker would not hbve advanced his money but for the false aisrepresentation."Any false representation as to the quality of goods was anfalsepretence if mith intent to defraud. ard CAMPBeELL was of opinion that this conviction could not be supported. It proceeded upon a mere representation, during the bargaining for the purchase of a eommodity of thesqmality of that commodity. In the last case, after the purchlase had been completed, there was a distinct averment of what was known to be false respecting the quantity of the goods, and in spect of that misrepresentation a largerdsum of money was received by the prisoner than he was entitled to ask; thereforehe was clearly of opinion the ase was within the statutel; bet here the case reolved itself into A mere representation of the quality of the article, and, bearing in miind, that the article pawned was of the species it was represented to be, and that the party obtained it because there was silver upon i, although not of t t presented, the party obtained an article dze hantiffresmaler quantity of silver upon it than was represented. It seemed to himi it never could have been intended by the L* gfisature to inake it an indictable offence for the seller to e:a,nine into the quality of the goods any more than it could be made anxindictable offence for the putrchaser during the bargain to depreciate the quality of the.goods. Not only 'a old the seller be indictable for a. misrepresentation, hut so would the purchaser for a'depreciation which.induced the seller to sell ar, an under price,: The quality here was inferior to that represented, buxt that'did not cm ihr h statute. coewtith Th odChief-Sustioo.

ARCHES' COURT. UON.DAY. MAY 11. J EBB V. DUN GANNON. (Be,for Sir J. DOBsON.) aLus was an appeal 1zom tne Uonsistory Court of St. Asaph. The proceedings were instituted on the part of Lord Dungannon for the purpose of procuring a faculty for the removal of a monumental tablet erected in the parish church of Chirk to the memory of a son of Mr. Jebbs, to whom Lady Dungannon was much attached, from the southern to the northern walL The monument had been erected at the expense of Lord Dungaunon, and put up underneath three of the monuments belonging to the Brynkinallt family, and it was now proposed to place it under the monument erected to the memory of the grandfather of the child, to which Mr. Jebbs objected on the ground that its removal was a personal affront to him. The Court below granted the faculty against which the present appea was prosecuted. a .p A ddams and Dr. Twiss were heard forthe respondent; the Admiralty Advocate for the appellant. The learned JuDaE thought it very desirable that tho parties should come to an amicable arrangement; he would therefore postpone his judgment until the fist session of next term. CRAWLEY V. CRAWLXY.

COURT OF BAZNERUPTCY, Basngha-str, Mday 11. Mr. Commissioner GouiTusP dispoEed of the business of the day. It was stated by Mr. LAwmRAwC during the proceedings, in the case of Leopold Redpath, convicted of frauds on the Great Northern Railway Company, that the Crown had not interfered in the disposal of the bankrupt's estate, and that a snm of about 3,0001., as realized from the sale of the bankrupt's furniture at Chester-terrace and Weybridge, was in the hands of the assignee.
CBNTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, May IL The May session of the above Court commenced this morning, before the Right Hon. T. Q. Finnis, Lord Mayor; Mr. Russell Gurney, Q.C., Recorder; Aldermen Farncomb, Sir F. G. Moon, Rose, and Lawrence; Mr. J. J. Mecht and Mr. Keats, Sheriffs of London and Middlesex; Mr. A. Crosley and Mr. J. Anderton, Under-Sheriffs, &c. The first edition of the gaol calendar contains the names of 107 prisoners for trial at the present session. The RECORDER, in cbargingthe grnd jury, said he was sorry he had to inform them that they would have to inqnire into averyconsiderablenumberof cases-a muchgreater number, indeed, than would have been expected, considering the interval that had elapsed since the last session--and also that a great many of them were of the most serious chba racter. The crime of burglary appeared to be very much on the increase, and it appeared, from returns that had been published, that the number of cases of this class had doubled during the last two years, and there were no less than 19 charges of burglary to be disposed of at the present session. There were also three charges of murder, in addition to one that stood over from the last session, and two caes of manslaughter to be disposed of on the present occasion. The first case of murder to which he had to direct their atten. tion was a charge against a seaman named George Bave, who, it appeared, had been placed in confinement on board ship for some offence, and the deceased was a corporal of marines. After the prisoner was set at large it appeared that the deceased was attacked by the prisoner, and stabbed, and by this means his death was occasioned, and upon these facts he did not think they could entertair any doubt that the prisoner ought to be put upon his tria, an any circumstances that mght be brought forward to mitigate the offence would be taken fully into consideration by the pettv jury. In another case of murder it appeared that the prsoner was a man named Tripp, and the deceased was his landlord, and it seemed that he had gone at a late hour of the night to the room occupied by the prisoner to ask for his rent, and upon his doing so .he risoner stabbed hinm with a swcrd, and so occasioned his death He did not appeartohave attempted any concealment of the act, basat once admitted what he had done, and the grand jury would in this case also consider whether there could be any doubt that it was their duty to find a bill for murder against the prisoner. The third case of murder was one of a different character to the othera A woman was charged with the murder of her illegitimate child, and it appeared that she had been delivered of the ohild in question in the workhouse, and when she left she took it away with her. Very soon afterwards the chUd was missed and upon the prisoner being questioned she said that it was dead. The child was subeequently found lying in an area with its skull fractured, and its death took place very shortly afterwards from the consequences of that injury. They would hear the medical evidence,which went to show that the child must have been thrown into the place where it was found with great violence, and they would consider whether, under these circumstances, it was not their duty to return a true bil. There was a charge of manslaughter of a somewhat pecnliar character. A woman named Catherine Colsen and a man named John Walsh were charged with the offence, and it appeared that the deceased was in a house of improper charcter kept by the female prisoner, and that a quarrel took place between them, in which Walsh was also engaged, and the deceased was struck and turned out of the house. The place, it appeared, where the affray occurred was near the river, and it would seem that the deceased, while endeavouring to escape from the prieoners and to avoid further violence, ran into the river and was drowned. There was clear evidence that the deceased was struck by one of the prisoners, and the principal point for the grand jury to consider was whether there Nwas anz evidence that both the acused persons took part in the violence that was committed upon the deceased and forced him into the river ; and if this was made out to their satisfaction they would find a true bill against both. There was another charge of manslaughter, in which it appeared that the immediate cause of death was an absces upon the body of the deceased. It appeared, however, by the medical testimony that this absces was the result of a blow, and it would be sbown that a very short time beforo the death there had been a quarrel between the deceased and the risoner, and that the former was knocked down, and whue he was on the ground the prisoner kicked him on thit part of the body where the abscess that was the cause of death subsequently formed; and if this fact should be made out to their satisfaction the prisoner would undoubtedly be in law amenable to the charge of manslaughter, and it would be the duty of the grand jary' to return a bill for that offence. Among. the remaining cases was a charge of felony against a woman named Hamilton, and the offence imputed to her was sending letters to different parties threatening to charge them with ai horrible crime, with a view to extort money. It appeared from the depcsitions that there could be no doubt that these letters had been sent for a considerable time, and there could be also no doubt from their tenour what the object of the writer must have been. The only question in the case would be, therefore, whether the evidence made oat conclusively that the letters in question had been written by the prisoner, and upon this point therewould be evidence asto her handwriting, and also relating to otherdocuments that were found at herlodging, andif they should considerthiswassufficient to satisfy them that the letters were the handwriting of the prisone t would be their duty to find a true bill against her. Ther was a charge against two persons named George Clerk and Rosa Bush of haviDg, by false pretences and represeDtations, induced a girl under 21 years of age to have illicit connexion with the male prisoner. It was well it should be known that there had been an important alteration of the law relating to matters of this description, and that by a reeent statute it was enacted that if any one, by false statements or represen. tations of any kind, should inducoe a girl under the age of 21 years to have illcit connexion with a man, the party making such representations was liable to be convicted of the offence of mis4emeanour, and to be imprisoned and kept to hrd ur for two years, It appeared that the girl in question had been introduced to tne male prisoner, and that under a promise of marrying her in a short time she consented to the intercourse-that subsequentiy took place between them. Their experience of what took place in civil courts led them to believe-that this course of prooeeding was very frequent, and it should therefore be known that where it was made out that a young girl wainduced, to consent to such a proceeding by any fale representation, such 'as a promise of marriage, where the party, as in the present case, was a married man, who could not, of course, perform the promise, it amounted to a misdemeanour, and it would be their duty to return a true bill, and persons who oommitted acts of this description would be taught that they were liable to criminal instead of civil proceedings, as formerly, for such conduct. There was another case of a similar character, in which;a person named Joseph Erlam was charged with taking a youn girl-from her parents without their consent. This was created an offence by a partictlar statute, and it was his duty to tell them tbiatit would make no differenceif it houldappear that there was no force made use of to induce the girf to leave her parents, but that, on the contrary, she went away of her own ancord. In the case of a girl under 16 years of age the laew did not acknowledge any consent on ber part, and if it should be made out to their satisfaction that in thiu particular cse the girl was taken away without the consent of her father it would be their duty to find the bill That the girl herself was a consenting party made no difference as the law said that no one had the right to take a young girl from her parents without their consent under any circumstaneucc The grand jury then retired Joseph Williams, a respectable-looking man, surrendered to take his trial for misdemeanour. Mr. SlMigh conducted the prosecution; Mr. Ribton and Mlr. F. H. Lowis were counsel for the defendant. |I This wo s a prosecution insttuted by the parochiol authonti of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, and the offence imputed to the defendantwv s tbat he had wilfully neelected to prvvide bis son, a lai 13 years of age, with proper looi, and so that he had neglected to supply him with other neceparies that. were requsite for bis heal-h iand comfort. It appeared that the defendant was in the service of the Post-office, and that he had a salary of 90C. a-year, and lived with his- wife and several children, among whom was the wnfortunate la whose treatment ras the subjecl of inquiry, and who,, it appeared, wvas of w7ak intellect, in a slI houee at Hoxton. The appearance of th child had, it seied, upon aeveral occaeionqE attradetb attention of th aighbonr sand at length Mtr. Lewes, a publieanx Fhe resided next ddor to the' desendant, and who had xaons,rted wlt1; ,him upon the t-abjeoe, and aptd,,to >e , 4 ~ItV Rat _ iiPr and kindness in the matter, went to the parish authorities and gave them information of the manner ia which i tbo unfortunate child appeared to be treated. Mr. Bartlett, the assistant relieving officer of Shoredipch, immediately proceeded to the residence of the defendant, and he there found the poor lad in a most pitiable condition, covered with vermin and fith, his body was all over sores, and he was in such a state of emaciation that he was unable to stand or walk. He was at once removed; to the workbouse, where he was cleansed and proper I foodl iven to him, and it was evident that he bad been.! biong t into the condition in which he was found by gross neglect, as he speedity rallied uponbeing properly fed and attended to; and it appeared that, although vhen he was £rst taken to tho workhouse he orly weighed six stone two pound; he now weighed seven stone four pounds, that increase in weight havingtaken lace in a period of two months. The poor lad was in court Buring the trial, and presented a clean and healthy appear. ance. It transpired in the course of the case that the dukes of the defendant at the Post-office frequently required his attendance there rnearly the whole of the night, and that he wss only at home for a very short period, and the care of his family during his absence devolved upon hs wife, who, it seemed, had frequently conducted herself in a very ceccentric manner, and who since these proceedings had been taken to a lunatic asylum. Mr. RIBTOI, in the course of an able address to the jury on behalf of the defendant, urged that the evidence was not sufficient to convict him of the offence imputed to him by the present indictment, and contended that there was nothing to show that the condition of the unfortunate child was occasioned by any wilful neglect on the part of the defendant. The evidence, he said, made out quite clearly that he was only at home for a very short period during the day, ani that the charge of the family devolved upon his fe, and he said that her unhappy condition of mind was probably the cause of the poor child being reduced to the pitiable condition in which it was found. The RECOnDER, in ummmingup, said that under the cir. cunmstances the prosecution was a very proper one, and it should be known that where the natural guardians and protectors of children neglected their duty in that respect they would receive that protection from other qarters. In the present case there could be no donbt that the child had been most grossly neglected, and the only question for the jury to consider was whether it was made outto their satisfaction that the defendant had neglected his duty as a parent towards the child, and that he was responsible for the manner in wbich it had been neglected. The jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Not ouu. Wiliam O'SuDivan, 20, pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of stealing a watch, the property of William Rowe. Mtr. Tlosipsowwas instructedto conduct the prosecaution, snd he stated that at the time the robbery in -nf--nn ^- commlteL the prisoner was employed as a polfce-constable at East Dulwich, and while on duty he committed the offence by opening the window of the prosecutor's houEe, and takiing the watch from the window-sill, where it had been left by accident. Mr. PBnuips, who defended the prisoner, said that he had pleaded " Guilty" with his entire concurrence, as he felt that it was impossible to struggle against the evidence for the proscution. He urged, however, in mitigation of punishment, that the prisoner had formerly served in the army, and bore an excellent character, and that he had in all probabiity been induced to commit the offence by the sudden temptation of seeing the watch in such an exposed position. In auswer to a question put by the Court the inspectoz of the division of police to which the prisoner beTonged stated that at the time the robbery was committed the prisoner had only been five days appointed to his office. The RECORDEB, in passing sentence, said it was a very serious offence indeed for a policeman, who was appointed to protect the public, to commit an act of this kind, andbut for the prisoner's previous good character and the belief that he had in reality yielded to sudden temptation, he should most certainly have sentenced him to undergo penal servitude. As it was, however, he felt compelled to pasn a severe sentence, ad should order him to be kept to hard lbour for two years. Sir Charles D. Crosley, the late Sheriff of London and Middlesex, was yesterday sworn in at the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell, as a Justice of the peace for the county of Middlesex, and also for the city of Westminstsr.

Mr. Ribton apeared for theprosecution,and Mr. Cooper The prisoner pleaded "Guilty," and was sentenced to four months' Imprisonment. James Gunn, 42, draper, was indicted for stealing some shawls, silks, and gloves, the property of James Peggs and another, his masters. Mr. Sleigh prosecuted, and Mr. Cooper and Mr. Robinson defended. The prisoner had been for about seven yeanrs in the employ of the prosecators, drapers at Shoreditch, and his wife kept a siop at Norwood. Someiircuenstances creating a suspicion, prosecutor said he should Fearch the wife's shop, to which the prisoner readily assented. Upon doing so goods belonging to the prosecator were found ambng the stock in the shop. The prisoner had been in the habit of dealing with the prosecutor for goods to be sold at the shop in Norwood, an the only evidence to establish the fact of the goods in question being stolen was that they did not appear entered in the proeecntor's books to the prisoner's aecounLt. It was admitted by the prosecution that the prisoner bore a ve high character, and several witnesses were called who estbuh ed that fact. The prisoner was Conrided, and Eentenced to 18 months' Imprisonment.

The Miay gneral sessions of the pesca for the conrty of Middlesex commenced this morning at the Court-house, IClerkenwrell, before Mr. Pashley, Q.C., assistant-judge, and a bench of magistrates. There vvere 59 prisoners for trial, of whom 46 were charged with felony and 13 with misdeineanour. Thde ASsIS'AT.J1T hOE delivered a short chage to the grand jury.

The COURT sentenced him to four yearspenal servitude Joseph Isemonger, 25, Cornelius Regan, 18, and Daniel R>egan, 35, were indicted for having stolen eight bottles of chanpagne ad aquantityof brass rods, the property of John.marLt Mr. I.angford appeared for the prosecution, Mr. lorry for the prisoners. This robbery was committed on Easter Monday on board a vessel called the Austral, lying in the London Docks. The prisoners had been employed in unloading ballast, and one of the cabins was broken into and a quantity of champagne taken away. The three prisoners were stopped as theywere about to leave the docks after the nsual hours; and, as they were so drunk that they could scarcely stand upright, they were questioned as to where they had obtained the rink. They said they had paid for it. They were searched, and some brass rods, which had been stripped off tho cabin door, were found uponthem, eight broken champagnebottles were found on board, and there was no doubt that they were taken at the same time as the rods. When they were charged with the theft by the officer, Isemonger said, " It won't do you any good, yo b-, to give us three months for such a bit of a job as this.`" The jury found them Guity. The Regans were sentenced each to eight months' hard labour (they being known), and Isemonger to six months'. John Bolton, 18, and Thomas Chapman, 18, were indicted for feloniously breaking and entering the warehouse of John Wilson, and stealing therein 451b. of rags and other articles, his property. They pleaded " Guilty." Bolton, who was an old offender, was sentenced to four years' penal servitude ; Chapman, who was not known, to one year's hard labour. George Wood, 19, wa indicted for stealing a purse and 36s. from the person of Emma Benfield. He was convicted and was proved to be a well-known thief, and the Court sentenced him to four years' penal servitude. . Richard Glover, 23, was indicted for unlawfully assaulting and beating George Ford, William Flanders, and WilHara Mole, constables of the metropolitan police force, in the execution of their duty. He pleaded " Guilty." On the 18th of April the, defendant ws beating a boy near the Angel at Islington, when a gentleman interposed, and as the defendant was about to strike him the policeman on duty came up and prevented him from doing so. The defendant then gave him two blows on the nose and resisted eing taken into custody in the most desperate mamner. He thtew the constable four times, kicked him in the back, bit his hand, and on twvo other constables coming up to assist he kicked them in a most brutal manner. The AS5ISTA?;T.JTJGE sentenced him to one year's hard labour. Thomas Anderbon, 45. schoolmaster, described as of superior education, was indicted for having committed an indecent assault upon a boy named Henry Drake. The defendant, it appeared, kept a school at Islington, and the prosecutor, a sharp-looking and intelligent boy, 9 years and a-half old, had been in the habit of going to his school, after the regular hours, to learn arithmetic. Ac. cording to his evidence, which was given in a clear and unhesitating manner, the defendant had on several occasions been guilty of most disgusting conduct towards him; but upon certain points in his statement, The AssisTAmT-J3 c left the case to thejury upon the question of consent. The jury, after some oonsideration, found the defendant sAot Guiiy, stating that they did so with regret. The defendant was detained in order that it might be ascertained if he could be indicted under another form. John Turney, 23, was indicted for feloniously embezzling money which he received on account of RPe Daviee, his mnaster. The prosecutor was a cowkeeper in East-road, City-road, and the prisoner had been in his service to carry out milk, On the Ilth of April he absconded, leaving his cns in the street, and it was afterwards foand that he had received moneyfrom customers forwhich he had not-ccounted, When he was taken into custody he said his master owed him wages. He now pleaded " Guilty," and, previous convictions for felony being proved against him The COURT passed upon him a sentence of four yearu' penal servitude. (Before if'. CREASYr.) Hlenry White, 18, was indicted for having recelved a pocethandkerehjer, the property of John Shackleton, he bowng it to have been stolec, I Th proieevWWe UM ^ p -oLo onataL4de.wB1 t appeared tlat he attended afair recently held at CAmden.towa in plain clothes.

The prisoner, itwould seem, therefore, was stationed outide the crowd toreive the property stolen by a gpng to which he belonged. The jury found him Guily,, and it was proved that he had been previously convicted of felony. ar. CRFASy sentenced him to four years' penhlservitaU
POLIUl. MANSION-sOUS-A deputation fr:m the National Association for the Unemployed of Great Britain, headed by Mr. M'Heath, waited upon the LonD MAyo for the purpose of soliciting pecuniay ansistance towards the expense of sending 50 labourers to Scotland, employment to whom bad been offered by a contractor vbo is about to construct works for conmeXing water from Loch Kstrine to Edinburgh. The .Osw MYoR sEai he had no doubt that, if a letter could be procured from the contractor, showing that the men were really to be employed in the construction of the proposed works, funds wonld be forthcoming to defray the expense of sending 20 out of the 50 to Scotland by Saturday GULDHAL.-Mr. Spence, of the firm of Spence and Buchanan, warehousemen, of 77 and 78, St. Paul's Churchyard, attended before Mr. Alderman HALE upon a mmons to answer the complaint of 1M Hart, of A, Taviatock. square, for obtaining money under falas pretenees. Mrs. Elizabeth aRut suld,-On Thura4ky afternoon last, between S and 4 o'clock, Ibelieve,I wi pasn through St. Pauls Churhyrd, when my attention was drwn to some silk dresses in Mr. SpenCe's ahop, marked up at 2 guineas, Iwntih and desired to look at them, and on bengcnducte=t& room. on the first floor, severa Z;;sse were shown to me. The assistant told me they were not aU sik, the body of the drAs being cotton, and I doclined taking one of them, beeause theywere not sufficiently pod. I requested the young man to show me some of a higher quality, and he accordingly brought two or three at the price of . 8s. 6d. each, one of which I purchaed and took away with me. Alderman HALs.-Was it paked up in your presence? Mrs Hart.-Yes, Sir. I do not think it left the counter. and I am certain the dres I boght was placed in the parcel I brought away with me. I ld no time to open the parcel that night, but in the morning I examined it, and found thatthesilkgivenforthe body and aldrtwasof a totally different colour ana texture from the rest of the dress Alderman HALL-Then, the dress is composed of two different qualities of silk, you having only seen one texture ? Ms Hrt.--That in so. Alderman HAL.-Then, you dia not look at the rest of the dess? Mrs. Hart.-I had no occasion to look at the silk under the flounces, because I believed I was in a respectable shop, anddidnotexpectany imposition. Ithought theilkwas, of course, all of one quality. Mr. Martin (the chief clerk).-Was any observafion or representation ruade in reference to the quality of the silk ? M. Hart.-None whatever with regard to the dregs I bought, but there was of those I rejected, for the amistant told me that the body was of a cotton texture. I decidedly thought the whole of the silk in the dress I bought was of the same quality as the flounces. Alderman HALE.- Do not ladies expect that part of the dress which is hidden by the flounces to be of an inferior quality? Mrs. Hart.-It is the general impression among ladies that a silk dress should be only of one quality. I did not see Mr. Spence during the purchase of the silk, but Itook it back to hMm on the following day, and asked him to let me have sufficient of the same quality as the flenoes to make the dsess, or to take it back and return me the money * but Mr. Spence declined to do either. Alderman Hl.n-T-That is thecase, 3Mr. Spenoo. Wbat have you to s3y inreply to this complaint ? Mr. Spence.-I have to give a flat contradiction to aU tbat this lady has said. When she brought back the dress I offered to change it, but refused to return the money. Mrs. Hart.-Ee offered to change it if Iwouldtake something at a higher ice.a Mr. Spence.-Tere was nothing s id acout pzice. Alderman HALF.-Do you know, Mrs. Hart, what the value of this dress is ? Mrs Hart-I really cannot say. I did not go in to buy a cheap article or a bargain. I gave the price tlat was asked for the dress. Mr. Spence.-In the report in to-day's Times it appears that Mrs. Hart stated to Alderman Humphery that the dress was taken away to be packed up, and that a different dress of an inferior quality had been aubstitu(d, but she now most distinctly states that the dress not on'y never left her sight, but that she is positive it is the PA me dress she purchaseod Mr Hart.-I never said. tho drmes had been changed. Our reporter here explained that upon M. Hartmaking her application, Aldermn Humphery said. "Then, what you comnplain of is, that a dress of an inf, rior quality has been iven to you instead of the one yoa I chedr' and Mrs Hart re *ed in the affirmative. Alderman HAix said that was evidently a miucndezstand. int andno reflection would rest upon Mlr. Spmnce on that Mr. Spence.-Then I hope that will be set right by the reporter, for itis a very serious imputation. Alderman HALL-The gentlemen of the press will, I am sure, correct any erroneous impression which haone forth to your prejudice; and, with regard to this case, 1 amaifraid Icannot give you any aEsistance, Mrs. Hart. Had yot bought this dress by sample, and then found it different or Inferior, I could have interfered, but it appears you had opportunities of examinin the dress, and had you done so you would have seen that the body and slirt were not of the same qualit as the rest of the dress. It was aca e in which you should havo exercised your own judgment. Mrs Hart.-The drewe was tacked in folds, so that I could not open it out. Mr. Spence-Mrs. Hat says this was the secord case within the week in which a simllar complaint had been made against us.I do not know where she derived her information, but the ease she refers to is one in which a person bought a dress with flounces at the trade price of 52s.6d., and he madehis complaint,by the adviceofa brother tradesman, at this court. I changed that dress, and have it now in court, although hundreds of them are at present selling at the same prioe. It is a piece of malice actuating these persons for the purpose of injuring uL Alderman HALF.-- cannot allow you to attribute malice to any ono in this matter. Mr Hart.-I could not possibly have any feeling of malioe against Mr. Spencoe, for he is a perfect stranger to me, and I never beard of there being othf r oomplaints until I applied to Alderman Humphery on Friday last. Mr. Roe, the summoning offlcer.-That is quito true, Sir; for when this lady applied it was ihought she came in another case, and that was how she was informed of the other complaint. Mr. Speneim-With regard to Mr Has dr's, the price it was sold to her at was 5s. or 6s. less tha a oDuld Dave got it for at any other house in London. The drews ia good value for the money paid for it, and I am prepared to prove it. Alderman HAE-The only way for you to put youself in a proper position with the public is to show that the drews is worththe money, and if you have any respectable gentleman present whos judgment canbe relied on, Ishould lie to have his opmion of the silk. Mr. Spence.-Ii have a gentleman from Meor Cooke, Sons, and Co.'s. St. Paul's Curchyard. William Mills wus then sworn, and said,-I am employed entirely in the silk department in essrs. Cooke's establishment. I have examined this dress, and, fromu my knowleodge of silk, I should say that it is cheap at 34 guineas It is customary to makeup flonnced dresses of two qualities of silk, as the flonones are made by one manufacturer and the rest of the dress by another. Alderman HALE.-This inquiry will be attended with some good, for it will induce ladies to look more carefully at what thoyare bue m Hr-It will also deter many ladies from entering that shop. I should like to ask if Cooke, Sons, and Co. supply Mr. Spenoe with these dresses! Alderman HA1r.-It is not necessary. There is no case against you, Mr. Spence, and the summons is therefore dismissed. Mr. Spence.-Ihope the press will correct the impression so unfavourable to us, now that the explanation has been given. The parties then retired. BOW.TR=Tr.-In the course of yesterday afternoon Mm. Chamberlin, solicitor, waited upon Mr. EAl, the chief magstrate, under the following circumstances:- The applicant stated that his object in coming to the court was to request the immediate attendanceo of his woraup at University College. Hospitl to take down the depositions of a young man named Taylor, whore death was hourly expected. His worship had no doubt heard the particulars of the melancholy and fatal accident which occurred on Saturday in the Tottenhamoourt.ro&d. Mr. H1ALL-What accident? Mr. Chamberlin.-The fall of three houses, by which several persons have been idlled. Among the sufferers was Mr. Ta unI , the son of a builder employed in making some alterations for Mr. Maple, the occupier of two of the houses in question. Mr. Taylor was removed to the hospital on Saturday, dreadfully crushed, but still sensible. An unfavourable change haa taken place and all hope of his recovery has been now abandoned by the medical men in attendanoe. It is not supposed that he can survive many hours, and therefore it is of the utmost importance that his evidence should be taken, to beusedinanyultimate proceedings arisng out of this disaster. IMr. EALL.-Is anybody in custody on any criminal cass-9 charge?I Mr. Chamberlin.-No charge has been preferred yet. Mr. HALL-Then howcan I interfere? Anydeposition mule before me would have no more weight or authority than one made before you. The dying declaration of any man can be taken dowm by the witnesea present, and afterwards given in evidence. You can do this yourself The applicat thanked his worship and-withdrew. MARLBOROUGH-STrT.-John Day was brought befors Xr. BEDON for final examination, charged with obtaining goods inthe names of-Admiral Sir- George Sartorius and Adjutaut Keppel by fraudulent representations. The prisoner declined to make any defence, and was fully committed for trial. From "J. U. S. C." 1. has been received for the poorbox.
