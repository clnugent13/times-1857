MP. B. HOPE, M.P., OX THE CONDITION OF THE RURAL CLASSES. The anniversary meeting of the Maid stone Agricultural Association was held on Thursday last. There was a plough. ing match In the morning on the farm of Mr. Whitehead of Barnjet. At the conclusion Mr. Whatman, M.P., ad. dressed a number of farm servants, including ploughmen labonrers, shepherds, hopdryers, &c., and presented them with the prizes or money-gifts allotted by the commlittee. A substantial luncheon was subsequently provided for the successful competitors. In the evening the members of the association dined together at the Star Hotel, Maidstone; Mr. Beresford Hope, hP., In the chair. The hon. gentleman, in proposing the toast of the evening,-"Success to the Maidstone Agricultural Association "-took occasion to make some observations on the coneltion of the labouring poor in the agricultural districts, and on the relations which exist between the owners and the tlllers of the soil. The hon. gentleman spoke as follows :-No man can consider any of the great questions relating to the social interests of the country without clearly perceiving that the interests of agriculture arc the interests of the whole community. Agriculture tbrives when the great commercial and manufacturing interests thrive, and when they fall agriculture falls. Or I would put it stiU stronger than that-I should say that griculture is one of the commercial interests of the country. Whe farmer who buys his manure, who cultivates his farm, or breedahis stock,or attends to his hops scientifically,who when he has got his produce ready for sale has to watch the tura, the rise, and the fall in the market-he, I say, is as much a merohant and a manufacturer as anybody in London or Leeds. Look at this meeting to-night, for instance. We We have come to represent the agriculture of the parishes immediately surrounding Maidstone, and hold stock, andhot. gardens, and corn-fields within a circle of some eight miles from this hall. What is the object of aU our farming? What but to feed the mouths in Maidstone, mouths congregated together inthis towvn bythe manufactories-the paper. mills, the oil-mills, the Jronworks, and other things-and therefore Maidstone Is as much a manufacturing town as Leeds or Birmingham, (Eear, hear.) I must almost apologize for dwelling at such length on a topic which I trust by this time is clear to every thinking man, and is universally admitted by every one interested In the country. (Hear, hear.) But yet on occasions like this it is fair we should put ourselves above reproach, that we should not let it be said, by making it impossible indeed, that we meet together onanyotherprinciplethanthis. (Hear,hear.) Ifthec-be all and end all" of such gatherings as these were the petty amusement-as in such case it might be termed-of giving away prizes for ploughing, or long servitude indeed we should merit all the gibes which have been made at similar associations, and all the jokes which they have given rise to among nimble wits. (Hear, hear.) But we scorn that imputation. We do not come forward with an elaborate eaogium upon our prizes, or that sort of rhetorical flourish which would compare them to the blue ribands and high honours of the State. We regard the gathering to-day, important as it is, merely as one element in that great social work, the moral and material regeneration of our labouring population. We are not foolish enough to suppose that our pizes constitute a ma,chinery powerful enough to work that out, but we do know that there is a homely proverb. "All1 work and no play makes Jack a dull boy; and while each on Isis own land and on his own farm strlves to raise his men higher than they have hitherto attained, he feels that it is not only harmless but gratifying to give them one gala day in the year, one opportunity of seeing what thair neighbours can do; encouraging them by these little gracefutl rewards which we have distributed to-day; taking good care not to exaggerate their minec, not to make a man suppose that when hEc has won a prize for ploughing or long servitude he is to go to the beershop and sot himself as a hero for the rest of his days (cheers); but that, as we progress in life, somecof those little bright gleams Of sunshine may be allowed to cross our labourers' path, such as our own family festivities, our periods of domestic triumph and success in our career of life, which now and then mark our checkered progress with a rosier hue. This work of ours, this gather. lag together to-day, is only one little element in the great work of social regeneration. As we have done our porstion of that work with the labourer in the field, we must now do another portion of that work together; wle, as landowners and tenants, must, besides enjoying the pleasant recreation of a festive evening, and exchanging all those kindly courtesies which on occasions like this pass from man to man, seriously consider what are the responsibilities which we take upon ourselves when we join a society like the present, We must take to heart the altered circumstances of the times, whether we all like them or not, for that is not a question which anybody dare now enter into. Times are not now what tbey were 50-aye, 20-aye, 10 years ago. Our labourer is a different man from what he was then. The labourer at Marden, for instance, by the side of the railway, able at an inconsiderable expense to reach London or any othuer place, must be a different man from what his father was, tramping in hobnailed boots through that desolate district of country, from which not even the squire or the parson could reach London except at a great expense, and at the close of a wearisome day. (Hear, hear.) We must educate ou,r labourers. :In this free country we all of us have our duty to perform. If we were all to perform those duties better, those wFhohoped meat wvould see that hope most accomplished, and those who feared most would see their fears most frustrated by not leaving in the hands of any man those terrible weapons of i"norance and prejudice which are the handmaids of social d'lsorder, havoc, and ruin. (Hlear, hear.) We have done much, I believe, to educate our men; we have taught them, without making them discontented, without trying to list them from that honest, that in many respects enviable position in which men earn their bread by the sweat of their brow-we have yet taught them something beyond the mudfield in which they plod, something beyond the milestone to wvhich they tramp, something beyond the brook which bounds their master's farm, and,writhout being anxious to go beyond that brook, to know the proper position of that farm and of their native country in the universe of created things. (Hear. ) We must go on persevering in this kind of education-we must not bea&raid tonGUt writing and reading in the hands of everyman. With that reading and writing we munst give a higher education, so'that they may. if they will, acquire solid learning through thc means of hooks-a love of sciecne, or poetry, or high fiction, but not of the obscene ballad or the lVecwga'c Calendcar. (Hear, hear.) The latter compose the "literature" of the uneducated. They are the "literature" of a class whose " little learning is a dangerous thing," and to avoid and to crush that danger we must move on;* we must not punll up. The labourer will then be made more man eandlees clodhopper. (Hear, hear.) Prizes given to the labourers by associations like these are not to keep them in astate of perpetual serfdom, looking on "a blue coat and brass buttons at the end of 50 years' service as the glorious termination of a well-spent career," as has been represented, hut they are as one of those little by-compliments to encourage persons who willingly toil in a difficult service. So much for one duty, but there are other duties no less pressing than this. There iS one particular duty which I have always felt strongly about, and concerning which I have alwasys expressed myself openly, and I do so now with more pleasure, because in this county an assoCiation has been formed for the express purpose of carrying out that great and good end. I mean giving to the labourers sufflicient and decent cottage accomnmodation. (HE[ar, hear.) The amount of responsibility that may have rested on the heads of the landlords of England for neglect of this is, I sinecrely believe and solemnly declare, a thing to appal us alL. Who can tell the wickedness. the unknown incest, till the hook of reckoning is opened, that has resulted from insuficient cottage accommodation, and of which landlords may be considered in a second degree guilty-a consideration which is enough to mnake the blood chill in the veins of every one of us. With a view of obviating this giant evil the Labourers' Friend Society has been instituted, ^and I had much pleasure in examining the models of the cottages which this society proposes to build. I think, however, there ought to be another room. What iS wanted is three bedrooms with other accommodation tsufficient for the necessary household work. Only one room is set apart for the latter, and as there ;s no outside wash-house, I think it is likely that the third bedroom will be used as a slttingroom, and the family will as heretofore " pig together" upstairs. I trust that no friend of that society wlill think that I am antagonistic to it or an ill-natured critic, but it is by freely communicating^ our views to each other that we may hope to arrive at good (hear, hear), and I may say that, perhaps, by introducing iron w here wooi is now used this little difficulty may be amended without in any material degree enhancing the cost and the rent of the cottage. (HEcar, hear.) Such associations as that mus, and will spread throughout the country, for there is a general feeling that, lone as we may have gone on in an apathetic and wirong coursE, from being accustomed to any system-from a sort of feechng, not blameable in itselF, that what we have been accustomed to is right-w/hen our eyes are opened to the right course, we w.ill not be niggard or lazy or stupid in carrying it out. (Hlear, hear.) I have seen in many instances a most admirable devotion to this branch of regeneration of the people by teaching them ideas of domestic decency, and I trust that the old system will fall to the ground, never to make its appearance again. (HEcar, hear.) undertakings like these, carried on with a strong feeling of our own responsibility, such as I hope anlrmates Us all to day, are things not to be carried out in a hurry-naot a scheme that can be projected on a Mornday, completed on the Saturday, and perhaps forgotten on thre Wednesday follow"ing; but step by step, day by day month by month, year by year, we must go on. We must be prepared at these aunuual gatherings to have a grest many istancs 01 uccessto comunicte to ach oli~br many instances of success3 to commiunicate tocach, other-_ possibly instances of failure to lament over-assured that the sum total of good will tend greatly to the increased happiness of our fellow-mnen. (Hear, hear.) We should the more gird up ourselves to a work like this on occasions like these, when all clases of the community are on toe one hand rejoicing at our triumphs in the East, and on the other have their apprehensions very fairly raised as to the condition of commerce and the money-market at home. I would not advise anything Quixotic. Of course in days like these everybody must be more than usuaUy cautious, but I will say that he who gives way to panic only angments that panic, and hurries on his own rain with that of the rest of the community. Distressing as may have been the events that have crowded around us of late, I do fully believe that the danger will be but temporary. I cannot and need not make any remarks as to what will be the behaviour of those who on the 3d of December will assemble at Westminster to deliberate on the best measures to avert the storm which has for the last few weeks darkened the horizon. I fully trust and believe that whatever measures may be taken will be for the beat and, that men of all shades of opinion will look upon this grave question, not with the eyes of party, but with that calm, deliberate, and friendly sympathy and confidence which has always carried us through in great emergencies. (Loud cheers.) Adverting to the war in India, and to the struggle in which the Biitish army was now engaged, the hon. gentle. said,-That small handfull of men, in which armies were counted by twenties, with a righteous cause to stir them on, and with the fear of God before their eyes, have won a glorious series of victories, of which nothing in the history of the world-not even in the niost superb victories of the heroes of antiquity-not in the proud, unrighteous reign of Napoleon L-was anything to compare with it. (Hear, hear.) The war li which we aRO at present engaged bas this peculiar feature in it-that all the difficulty, aU the successes, all the daring, and all the sCience of the enemy redound to ourcredit. The enemy are the barbarous natives of o distant oountry-poor, indolent, wretched, sleepy cultivators of the soil, who by Britieh enterprise, British teaching, and British ability, have been made soldiers of. Every success they have won is owing to what we have taught them-the defence of Delhi was our skill in engineering-the guns that spread devastation among our hosts were guns cast In the foundry over which the General who captured Delhi presided. With these odds against: them, our gallant fellows have stood their ground in days when even the natives cower in the shade. They stood the mid-day sun and the nightly oholera, even more terrible and jatal than the sword. They have made marehes which half-miles were counted by battles fought and won. They have scaled the Imperial city, in which a third of the storming party lost their lives, in which it was not, as in other contests, one man in a hundred that was, killed, but each man saw his comrade fall, and amiong those who have thus fallen are names dear to all EnglishmenNicholson at Delhi and Neul at Lucknow, both of them men of whom were formed the brightest hopes of the honour and glory of a future career of triumph. (Hear, hear.) But lIavelock is saved (oheers)-that brave old man whose sinews more than 60 years have not palsied, and who In the sear and yellow leaf of life has shown more than the wisdom of a sage, and more than the daring of a stripling (loud cheers)-snd the chivalric Oatram, who yielded to the comrade by his side that meed of victory which, according to all rules and regulations, he might have plucked. This, too, was no, wanting to that memorable day, when our small and gallant bands fighting from house to house and from street to street, planted the British standard on the Imperial palaceof the race of Tamerlane. (Hear, hear.) Here was a spectacle for ages to admire. Most unfairly and most unreasonablyin various countries on the continent discredit has of late been thrown upon the British army. Most unfairly and unreasonably, I say, because, while before Sebastopol our army lost only 14,000 men, that of our much vaunted Frenchalhy lost 80,000. This is a fact which I have upon the best authority. The French had only donble the number of troops in the Crimea that we had, and their extraordinary loss was caused by mismanagement, by deficient commissariat, by everything, indeed, that we were taxed with, but from charges of which our vaunted French allies escalped scot free and reaped the laurels which were as much, if not more, the due of our much maligned, but better managed, army. (Hear, hear.) We were most unfairly discredited upon the continent, but now upon the plains of India wve have made ourselves a alame at which our coldest critic and our bitterest enemy must tremble and admire. (LFoud cheers.) __

Mr. Jackson's horses were put up by auction yesterday at Tattersall's. The sale yard was fully attended, but the crowd consisted more of those persons whom the fame of some of the animals to be sold had brought together than of people who had come 'with the determination of doing business. Saunterer excited much curiosity, and was ultinmately knocked down to Mr. Blenkiron for 2,150 guineas. It is likely, however, that he wil not be delivered up until the close of his racing career, when he will be used for stnd purposes. Indeed, it is questionable whether a bond fide sale was effected. Magnifier, who was much talked about in connexion with the last Derby *'Bullock to ride," was sold for 45 guineas; Precious Stone by Touchstone-Perfection's dam brought 500 guineas, the exact price which Mr. Jackson gave for her at Doncaster in September last; Brother to blyaway was transferred for 460 guineas.

THE LATE GENERAL NErLL.-At a meeting of the Commissioners of Supply of the county of Ayr the chairman, Colonel J. Ferrier Hamilton, called attention to the lamented death of one of their numfer, General Neill. Sir James Fergusson, of Kilkerran, proposed, and XMr. James Campbell, of Craigie, seconded, the following resolution, which was unanimously agreed to:-" That the Commissoners of Supply desire to secordthe regret and sorrow which they have felt in hearing of the death of the late General Neill, and their deep sense of the loss the country at large has sustained in the untimely end of that gallant General's career, who during the short period of his service in Bengal had contributed so largely by his energy, courage, and military skill to the check which has been given to the ravolt of the native army and to the brilliant achievements of the British forces and the loyal portion of the native army. That the chairman shall convey to the bereaved widow and mother of General Neill a copy of the foregoing resolution1 in the hope that this expression of sympathy, combined with the recollection of his glorious death and the untversal admiration of his great qualities and services may afford to them some consolation under their deplorable calamity." FATAL BOILEP} ExTLOsioN.-Yesterday morning a dreadful boiler explosion took place at Mr. C. G. Kayo's cotton-doubling mill, Upper Ashley, near Huddersfield, by wbich seven women and a man were killed, and several other persons were seriously injured. Five were taken to the infirmary, two of whom are not expected to recover. Two persons are still missing. The miil is situated between the canal and the river Colne. The workpeople had returned from dinner, and wero waiting for the steam to be got-up, when the boiler burst. The boiler was a single tube Cornish one, eight or nine yards long and seven feet in diameter. It burst into fragments, which were scattered in opposite directions, completely destroying the building in which it was placed, whieh was three stories high. Nearly one-half of the boiler was tbrown into Mitchell's dyehouse-yard, a distance of 20 yards, and another piece made a deep dint in an engine boiler there, but, fortunately, did not break it. Two dead bodies of women were thrown into the doorway of the dyehouse so mutilated that they could not be identified. The cause of the explosion is supposed to be over-pressure in getting up steam to commence work. SOUTH KENSINGTON MTrsEUm.-During the week ending November 23 the visitors bave been as follows:On Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday (free days), 2,841; on Monday and Tuesday (free evenings), 5,107.

THE CORY TRADB. MAR1K-LANE, Nov. 23. The supplies last week were good, with the only excep. tion of a falling off in oats. The exports were 29 quarters oats, and 779 sacks of flour. Of English wheat there were 5,076 quarters, of foreign 11,892 quarters. The morning's supply from Essex and Kent was but moderate; business was steady, but slow, at last Monday's rates. For fine samples of old foreign there was a somewhat improved inquiry at folly as much money. Heavy arrivAls off the coast made the floating trade very dull. The receipts in English flour were 15,423 sacks, i foreign 4,108 barrels 918 sacks. The price of Norfolks Was reduced to 34s. per sack, but no farther alteration took place in town_ made. Foreign as last quoted. The quantity of English barley was 4,360 quarters, of foreign 7,427 quarters, without activity in trade. All de. scriptions were hold at previous rates. Malt, prices were steady, without much passing. The supply of oats was below an average, there being only 174 quarters English, 650 quarters Scotch, and 19,318 quarters foreign-total 20,032 quartera. A reaction was experienced in thin trade, and the prices made of good corn were fUlly 6d. to is. beyond last Monday's. Of beans there were 813 quarters native, and (with a cargo from Alexandria) 2,096 quarters foreign. Of peas there were 568 quarters home grown, and 1,020 quarters foreign. Sales were slow, but prices withou' alteration. The linseed supply was 4,020 quarters, with an export of 80 quarters only. A further fall of 2s. per quarter took place, but cakes continued in active demand at full prices. The eeed trado was without interest; cloverseed, trefoil, canary, hempseed, and other descriptions remaining at previous quotations. CUR.RENT3 PRIMCS OF BRITISH GRAIN AID PLOUR It; MAR K.LANI}.

The direotors of the Western Bank having intimatedthatthey would entertain no offer of composition unless accompanied with satisfactory security, and the Messrs. Macdonald having stated their inability to give security, the creditors unanimously agreed to elect a trustee and wind up the estate. It was believed that the offer the bank. rnpts were prepared to make, in the event of the creditors accepting one, was 6s. Sd. per pound, payable in isistaltnents. A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. John Alonteith and Co., calico printers, was held the same day, at which the firm's liabilities were stated to be 450,0001., and tho assets 27,0001. The committee of creditors who examined the state of the company's affairs value the assets at only 10,0001. No offer of composition was accepted. At ameeting of Messrs.

THE WOLVERHAM.PTON AN.D STAFFOBDSHIRD BANK. WOLVERHAMPTON, Nov. 23. This day a meeting of the Shareholders in this concern was held b.t the Swan HoteL It had been convened by cir. ctjars froms ?_4. Alexander Hordern, the chairman of the directors. Mr. Hordern preslded. After some little diseussion it was determined that the press should be represented by the reporters, the directors gyIng that for their part they had nothing to conoeaL The CnAiRAN then called upon Mr. Brlscoe, one of the directors, to read the circulars which appear in our columns to-day. Arrived at the point in the document in vhich the Bhara states, Your directors would also be willing themselve to raise and lend 50,0001. to the bank," o2r. BrISCOx saidr-That sum, gentlemen, after giving it consideration, the directors have come to a determination to double, and to make it 100,000D. (Loud applause.) The CRAinRm then said that before the directors slid! more they were ready to answer any inquiries that might bo made of them by the shareholders. Mr. B. DIxoN wished to knowr if the shareholders assumed that the statement that had been read by Mx. Briscoo was correct ? Mr. Eill was called upon to reply. Mr. HILL said he asdsted in the drawing out of the balance, but he did not go through the banking deposits and oter snmilar accounts. As far as he could give his opinion the balance was on the safe side, so far as the interests of the bhnk were concerned. Some of the accounts would be worth more than 10s. in the pound, and some less all would depend upon the extent to which the parties might; beaffectedbyanyfuturelargefailure. The debitbalances. which had been made out by other parties, he believed were perectly correct, as was also the sum taken off for pro hable loss. In these times, however, they were liable te alterations, and such alterations might be of an important character. Mr. E. DIxox.-The course now to be pursued will depend upon the course which the shareholders may take. e best plan would be to appoint a committee of th; shareholders and cosut witfih both shareholders and credlitors. With their for4earance, and meeting the thing with readiness of action, the bank might resume with the confidence of the public, and remove all loss that would result from a different course. Mr. LEiGH (stipendiary magistrate) quite concurred with. the views of the gentleman who had addressed them last, and he beheved that they would be the views of most of the shareholdem. That was the most importaut meeting that had been held in connexion with the recent affairs of the bank. Let them say nothing now of the paSt (hear, hear), but see how they could work together in a friendly spirit for the future. (Hear, hear.) The question before temnwas, was the bank to close or goon? [A Shareholder. -'IGo on, undoubtedly."] (Hear, hear.) If it was to go on, there was but one way-one way only-that was by thus shareholders glving, with amicable feeling, their one undivnded support to the directors and the creditors. ( Eear, bear.) lIe would propose a resolution in conformity with the views which Mr. Dlxon had just expressed. It was e~ That this meeting is glad to fdd that a temporary committee ot dep.sltors and creditors has beenappoinied to coafer with the dCrector and trust that the maeeting to-mosow wi eUcit a permanent com. rimttee to act in the spirit of the above resolutions." Whatever might be their views as shareholders, they could not carry out the proposition that had been sub. mitted to them except by the concurrence of the creditore. They were largely at the mercy of the depositors, who must~ be shown a reasonable prospect of carrying on the bank with success. They had there a body of gentlemen not influenced by prlvate feelings; but by a desire to do All that they could for th shareholders and creditors. (Hear, hear.) He had already spoken with muany of the creditors, and he was sure that tLair feeling was not otherwisc than friendly. The sharehvlders could not pledge themselves to accept the pro. posal of the directors absolutely And entirely, as so much repended upon the feelings exhibited and the proposal submitted to them by the creditors. The resolution which he, bad just proposed would be followed by another, in which X committee of shareholders, having ascertained the views of tbe depositors, should have power to clowe with the offer of the directors at once. They would have to put It to the creditors whether, by pursuing other than a friendly feeling, they would better thehr position. The creditors would have to decide whether they could benefit themselves as much. by any course that they might pursue as by giving the directors and shareholders a ressonable time and exercising forbearance. That course would be best both for the deposdtoIs aud the shareholders. It was to the last degree desirable that the depositors should exercise confidence and & friendly feeling towrardsthem. (Hear, hear.) The depositors would, he hoped, feel that a great public calamity had befallen them, and rould not be guided alone by pecuniary considerations. He had no doubt that they had come tothe needed decision. The resolution was unanimously carried. Mr. LEIGH then proposed four other resolutions, stating that in the coursewhich he had pursued he had been greatlyassistd by Mr. Field, who had come down from Loadon to assist the directors with his advice generally, The direc.- tors, however, had not availed themselves of his services, because they thought his object was to advise them upon the Winding-up Act. Mr. BOLTON, solicitor, thought that the shareholders would not only raise 40,0001. xS a call, but also a similar amount by way of loan in advance of cal. Mr. LEIGHI then proposed the following resolutions, which, comprised the whole of the remaining business:- * That the folowing gentlemen bt appAinted a oommittee of eh%rW' holders, with power to add to their numbers, and with power to ap. point committee of such smauer number of their members a they thint fit to act with the dirtors: -Messrs. W. E. Sparrow, Bolton, Eamp, Edwin Dixon, WoodiIelgh, Hil C0. lwell, pleming. andWynn. " That the directors take no step of Importance without the concur. reuce of such commitwee of shareholders. "That the committee ot shareholders have the power to adop: the, psopoal ot the directors submlttedlithl day, without reportlng to a general meeting of the sbhreholder&q " That this meeting Is glad to dud that a temporary comamittee or depositora and creditors has been appointed to cotfer vith the direc. tore, and trust that the meeting to-morrow wilV elcit a permanant oommittee to act in the spirt of the above resolutions." The meeting of depositors will be held on Tuesday (this day).
THE GREJ412 EASTERN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Allow me to suggest through your valuable paper what seems to me, as an engineer, a simplo means, at all events, if assisting to get the Great EAstern Bteamship intcF the water. What I would propose is to take advantage of the rise anl fall of the tide. I would place a number of, say, coal barges ride by side with their bows towards the vessel; the barges I would load with iron or other heavy material to the fulI extent of floatation ; and then, having erected a framework, carrying roUers, above the barges, and abutting on the shora or on piles driven into the river, I would attach numerous chains to the cradles on which the ship now rests, and lead them over the rollers or drums and attach them to the barges, The efrect will be this,-as the tide rises the loaded barges with many thousand tons in them, if required, will rise also, and the slack of the chains being taken up, on the tide receding, a pulling action wiU be brought to bear on the cradles and great ship in the direction of the river by theowering of the barges and the direction of the chains with an immense power; and while this action is going on. let the hydraulic pressure be applied, as already arranged, on the other side of the vessel or cradles, and I believe the mighty vessel will reach the river in safety. Of course, should the veasel show any tendency to run off when once started, the check gear is ready; and should it be desired to let her down slow]y, the same means or the action of the tide may be again and again used. I have, of course, not entered into any details, as, if any plan of this nature be adopted, the names of Brunel ani John 13cott Russell are suficient guarantees for the full carrying out of such plan. Your giving this room in vour columns w obic Aonr I obediently, GEORGE NAZMYTW C:.E I i, Ine lerrace, i&enungton-park, Kennington, Nov. 23.
OUR COMMAfOZ ROADS. TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TT3ES. Sir,-Two letters have lately appeared in your valuabla columns respecting our common roads. Will you allown me to offer a few remarks? Our system is excellent in theory, but in practice is in. famous, cruel, and wicked. The M'Adam who introduced the plan (which, if honestly carried out, is a good one) lays down as a rule not on any aecount to be departed fronm that in no case should the broken stones used for road. repair exceed in size 1? inches on any Bide, and tbab the road should be welf picked or scarified for the new stones to incorporate with the old. Now, what is the practice? Last Thursday morning, on my way to town, I picked up from the road between the top of Lea Bridge-road and Clapton-pond the two pieces of stone I herewith send you. One measures 4 inches by 2i inches, the other 3- inches by 24, inches The road was being picked in very shallow lines full 1S inches apart, and the stones (thousands as large as those I send you) were being laid over much tDC thick. To call such work road-repair is truly monstrous. I feel assured that if the roads were properlv cut up -say, the lines three to four inches apart only, the stones brokeas to the proper size and laid down much thinner, that money would be saved and much less punishment infficted on the unfortunate cattle.

SuDDEN DEATH.-A case of awfully sudden death occurred on Sunday evening in the Artillery Garrlson, Woolwich. The Rev. Sandford Connor, aisstat mii. tary chaplain, having complained of indisposition that; morning the order for the performance of Divine service, at which it was his duty to ohiciate, was in consequence coun. termanded, and the rev, gentleman, although not seriously complaining, confined hiaself to his quarters. About the niddle of e day his servant entering his room found hinx in a stato of syncope, whereupon he immMiately ran forthe assistance of the Rev. A. M. Wright, oue of the chap. lains of the garrison, 'who ordered him to procure the attendance of a medical offloer of the establishment. Drs,Warron and Little were promptly on the spot, but found that life was quite extinct. The deceased was about 30 yeas of age. A post mortm examination will be made of the body, pending which it is supposed the deceased died fromi cerebral apoplexy.
&ONRVEY-MAARKETand CITY JINELLIGENCE. Monday Eveaing. In aU departments of mercantile business to-day the tone of improvement has been more distiact than at any time since the first turn became obaervable. There is still an absence of further failures, and the statement boldly circulated on Saturday of new banking difficulties in the north proves not to have had the slightest foundation. -&n additional amount of buMon has been taken to the Bank, and there is stiU likely to be for some time a gradual return of sovereigns from Scotland and Ireland. The state of actual panio may thereSore be considered to have eatirely passed. AU that Is now to be apprehended is that a considerable slumber of firms throughout the country whose 2neans have already been taxed to the utmost will be unable to go on through the pressure which must yet be felt, and which can be mitigated only by degrees. The period has arrived, how4ever, when there will be on all sides a greatly improved disposition to extend mutaal ai l. Consols for money opened at a recovery from the point to which they receded after regular hours on Saturday, and, although some speculative sales subsequently caused a renewed decline, the market at the close had a steady appearance. The first transactions were at 891 to 90. From this they went to 89i to 1, and the final prices were 89g to I for mnoney, and 89, for the 7th of December. The sales in the morning were apparently in consequence of conjectures as to the financial measures that may ba announced on the assembling of Parliament-a fnding of Exchequer-bills being still thought likely to be one of them. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 88i to ; New Three per Cents., 8S* to Q; India Stock, 214 to 216; India Bonds, 45_, to 35s. discount; and Exchequer-biUs, 14s. to 0Os. discount. In the Stock-Exchange there was an increased supply of money, and short loans were obtainable on Government securities at 7 per cent. At the Bank of England the demand also was less heavy. The transactions in foreign stocks have been modeate. and show little alteration. Turkish advanced at the opening, but afterwards receded, and closed about i per cent. lower than on Saturday. Braslllan Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99; ditto. 1829 and 1839, 98; ditto, Four-and-a-Half per tents, 9GC ; Chilian Six per Cents., 1011 and i; Mexican, for the account, 18i and i; Portugnese, 42 ; Russian Five per Cents., for the account, lOG; Spanish, for the account, 41 and l; ditto, New Deferred, for the amcount, 25 and i; ditto, eertificates, 5.1; Turkish Six per Cents., 88; for the accoLut, 87i and J; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 97*. The corn-market this morning was firm at the rates of Monday last. The Liverpool cotton-market also exhibits a stronger appearance. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 636f. 75e. for money, and G6f. 85c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth. About 160,0001. in Australian, Russian, and other gold was sold to the Bank to-day. There is one aspect of the agitation against a rigid maintenance of the Currency Law of 1844 which, if recognized by the public, will especiaUy assist their comprehension of its nature. The theory of Protection was not extinguished with the Corn Iaws. On Thursday week the battle on its behalf wiU again be resumned in the House of Commons. Sides have changed, and this time it is the commnercial classes who are to protest against unfettered ;markets. The vital principle at issue is the same, but whereas we might now find Colonel Sibthorp, If he were alive, fighting against Government interference with the price of gold, the manufacturers, money dealers, and traders are clamouring that it is upon this alone ourfinancial safetyintimes of trial must depend. Gold is a commodity, and is regulated by the same natural laws as every other commodity. Bat the cry is that it is impossible for the commerce of the country to be carried on unless Government is empowered whenever, owing to a foreign or home demand, the metal rises beyond a certain value to take measures to check this rise, and to enable those -vho would otherwise be obliged to comply with the market terms to get it at a lower rate. "We ceannot," it is said, " when all the world are strug. gling for it, be content with our regular share. 0O course it will flor where the highest price is bid for it and if we bid higher than other natiois we shall get as much as we want; but it is inconvenient for those who require an article to have to pay more -than they expected for it, and if those people, whether abroad or at home, who have hoards of Eovereigns in their possession will not lend them to the indebted classes at a lower rate thau 12 or 15 per cent., it is the business of the Prine Minister, for the protection of those classes, in some way -either to discover secret deposits or to manufacture a pretended supply that shall render them independent of such extortionors." Happy arrangement ! While the hard calculator sees the time at hand when the gold he has prudlently reverved will be worth 15 per cent., the dashing speculator comes to him with a laugh <and says, " I shall offer you only IO per cent, Government, considering that you were making joo large a profit, have sent a quantity of the stuff into the market, so now you must be content to take such a rate as they think reasonable. Perhaps you expected also to buy sugar, silk, and all sorts of articles at a vast reduction. If so, you are disappointed. Thanks to Government, prices are looking up again. Doubtless, you think you were very wise in the results of patient inquiry and resection that told you that about this time the improvidence of other traders and a foolish panic on the part of a selfish multitude would render gold vorth almost anything; but if, instead of troubling your brains by watching the regular movements of mercantile affairs and providingagainst them,you had got some friend to tell you wvhat was going on in Downing-street, you would have done better." In vain the deluded capitalist might exclaim that this additional quantity of circulating medium which the Government have brought into the market is not gold, but simply paper secured by their own credit; and that those who have contracted to receive gold will surely not receive this paper on the same terms. On that point the answer would be, they have no choice. The new credit-notes have been inanufactured so as to be ideAntical in appearance with 'those which represented gold, and they are indiscriminately a legal tender. The infusion has been at the rate of 2,000,0001. in 20,000,0001., and consequently the currency has undergone a debasement of 10 per cent. Of course that is the sole reason of its being eheaper. The extent to which the infusion should be carried has not been settled. Some of its advocates wish a iding scale,-that is to say, the issue of a certain quantity when the value of gold reaches Spercent., a further quantity at 10 per cent., and so on. In all this we have the old play revived, only with different actors. The plea of the agricultural protectionist was, that unless Government would make corn dear the fields must be left untilled-that of the manufacturing protectionist is, that unless (overnnent will make gold cheap our mills must go out of work. He cannot compete with the foreigner except upon this condition. In each case 'tbe commnnity at large would bear the tax. Every fall in the rate of interest causes the prices of produce to advance, and the consumer suffers in proportion. Whether the paying sections of the community will consent to give Government tho power henceforth to perform the proems whenever the borrowing sections may assure them by the force of a sufficient number of deputations that it would be desirable is the grand question of the coming controversy. The following is from a shareholder of the Western Bank of Scotland, upon wbom the great Glasgow meeting of Wednesday last seems to have made no impression " Sir,-Although a shareholder of the Western Bank of Scotland, I quite approve many of your severe strictures upon the gross mismanagement that has characterized the direction of that uafortunate concern. " Even supposing that this had not been the third time the bank has found itself in a difficulty, I would feel disposed to withdraw all farther confidence from the directors, believing that they have neither the capacity nor spare time to manage a concern of such magnitude, and that for the future they would do as in the past,-leave the control to some reckless subordinate. " Without exhibiting to the shareholders any statement of the real state of matters, the directors have had the presumption to ask their constituents to put their bands in their pockets, and to back them with another milion of hard cash. Are the men who could not manage the bank under every favourable circumstance, with command of 8,000,0001 sterling and unbounded credit, likely to manage profitably now with impaired means and broken credit ? " Ia the North British Mail I observe that the directors give notice of their intention to apply to Parliament for certain powers; among others, permission to create preference stock, and 'to reatrain or suspend the transference of stock from and after the 28th of October last.' Now, Sir, this I submit is a virtual confiscation of my property, and opposed alike to law and reason. 'When I know that the Western Bank is involved six figures deep, with such reckless traders as Mlenteith and Co., with assets estimated at 10,0001. to meet liabilities of 450, 0001.,; M'Donald and Co., with liabilities at least 500.0001., and unable to pay 6s. 8d. in the pound; W. Smith and Co., with but 7,0001 to meet 109,0001., I resolved determinedly at once to kmow my true position as a shareholder. I have been deluded and duped, but, as involved to this time, am ready to contribute my ouota to the fearful loss incurred. Beyond this, however, f wll not go, and I protest against my property, isolern vofen.s, hbeir 'or o.le moment longer placed in further jeopardy. "iLf the directors will be so intatuated as to attempt to carry on the hank, let them take stock and allow dissentient shareholders to retire at their own estimate of the value of the residue. "Iam, &c.,i "A S EAREaOLDER." The following very able letter on the same subject appeared in the Daily Scotsmnan of Saturday last:- " Glasgow, Nov. 18. "Sir, -Thepress of this city isful of invective against our old and steadier banks for naot supporting their associate the Western Bank in its late dilemma. Their conduct is ascribed to jealousy, rivalry, and every other unworthy motive. In this western part of the world no credit is given to them for common sense in the management of their own affairs, or for reasonable care of the publio interests, in so far as tho character and conduct of our Scotch banking system is connected with those intereats. I am wholly of a different opinion, and consider they would have abandoned their duty if they had lent their aid to screen from public animadversion this abuse of our system of banking, as weU as to deceive the world stiU further with regard to the necessary consequences of that abuse to the pubic, to their poor shareholders, to their creditors, and even to their debtors relying upon accommodation in the ordinary and regular transaction of their business, " It seems a meeting has been held here to attempt to sup. port the concern by other means. Is It not enough that its mismanagement should have caused the late panicplaced every other bankng establishment, of whatever character or credit, in much jeopardy-and paralyzed the whole monetary systm of the country by the drin of so large an amount of coin from the Bank of England at a moment of such severe trial? What security have we, in placing the same power in the same hands, that the same game will not be played over again? "Let us examine the process by which itis proposedto set the bank again in motion. A meeting of the larger and richer constituents of the bank propose to borrow a miUllion at the interest of 7 per cent., on the allegation that it wil be for the advantage of the poorer shareholders to add that interest to their loss, as a lesser evil and danger than the greater loss that may arise from winding up the concern. How do this poorer class of shareholders know this ? On whom are they to rely for honest accounts and estimates of the assets of the bank, so as to enable them to form a judgment ? One might be disposed almost to forget the public interest in the matter if one could see the chance of saving more from the wreck for these poor people, who have embarked as shareholders on delusive hopes and reports of profit. We must have a clearer insight into the accounts of the bank before we can decide whether their condition might be made better or worse by the measures proposed at the meeting. How are trustees acting for others to incur a risk npon such assurances ? " Would it not be the proper preliminary step to have a thorough sifting and examination of the accounts by disinterested parties? I suppose no one would dream of intrusting this task to any of the directors, or the larger clients of the bank, whose individual positions are so much Implicated. The first inqlary, indeed, should be into the balancesheet in May. I think that was the period when 9 per cent. p'afit was divided, and a large surplus, declared to be then realized, added to the rest. Was that a true or a fictitious statement, made by some persons; interested in concealing the trutb, and assented to by others from negligence and neglect of their dauty? Nobody now believes it was a correct statement. Was there at that time an amount of convertible securities in possession of the bank to enable them to pay their circulation and deposits at a reasonable notice ? Were large advances, made on uncovered credits, or on inconvertible securities, then knowvn to the manager, and which ought to have been known to the directors, as doubtful debts, carried to the credit of the concern as good and available assets ? Look at the suspidon naturally created by such accounts If the fact comes out, as is generaUy supposed, that those behind the scenes have the power of escape themselves, or of advising their friends to escape, wvhile the ignorant and confiding shareholder, trusting to the declared profits and the reputation of the prosperity of the bank, is left to suffer. The case may or may not be so; but the public have a right to a rigid examination before this bank shaU be allowed to resume its operations under the present direction. " Our good folks here may depend upon it that patching up and concealment will help them but a little time loDger. WVhen Parliament meets it cannot be supposed that the English members will permit the whole question of deposit banks, founded, as they will allege, to collect capital from the many, to be employed by the few and their immediate friends and connexions in extravagant speculation, to remain in its present state without the most rigid inquiry Some security must be taken against the recurrence of the abuse of a system (most useful in itself when in responsible and prudent hands) which will protect the shareholders and the public against the consequences now brought upon them prlincipally by the failure of the Western Bank. The past, indeed the vhole course of management of that bank, will afford the best proof of the greatest practical abuse of the system, and afford some clue to the necessary measures to check or prevent it for the future. Whether this may be best done by publicity, by some independent audit, or by other provisions, will be a subject for future consideration. But, in the meantime, it would appear reasonable that some strict inquiry should be instituted into the accounts of the Western Bank, when they appeared, iu the judgment of the directors, to justify so large a division of profit in May, and into the present state of their assets, before the public and their shareholders agree to their resuming business. " It is always said the bank is solvent. To be sure It Is; the poor shareholders can pay. But is the capital of the hank safe? It has traded on the assurance. Where are its convertible securities? If it had any, even to a limited proportion of its deposits, why should it have stopped payment? Let the public have detailedland accurate statements, not probabilitiesfounded on the calculations and assurances of those who made the balance-sheet in May. This letter has grown to a length very inconvenient for your columnns; but I nevertheless trust to your publication of it. It will provoke inquiry, and you will agree with me inquiry can do no harm. Nobody suspects the directors of appropriation of the funds to their own use, as in the case of the directors of another bank whose trial is approaching in the courts of England. But it may be that the representations of the one set of directors with respect to the a-sets and condition of their bank have (though made only through inattention) only been in a relative proportion less incorrect than those of their London brethren. "Iam, &C., " INVESTIGATOR." "B.S. Since I wrote-my letter I have read in the papers the proceedings at the meeting of Western Bank depositors held on Wednesday. These proceedings suggest many reflections, with which it is needless to trouble you at present, But they give us one m-ain point of information. They state the actual assets at the bank amount to TJ,JY,12§. Thesimpe viy of testing the cret ness of this statemeat is to appoint adequate auditors to examine and sift it. If their report corroborates the state. ment of the directors confidence will be at once restored, I would suggest that these auditors should be appointed by the Provost of Glasgow and the Sheriff-men of independence and intelligence, and entirely unconnected with the bank. The directors propose to raise a million of money for the support of the bank. They propose to pay i only one-fifth of deposits under 501., and the depositors above that sum sball wait for two years for payment of the amounts due to them! The one-fifth of the 500,0001. due to smaU depositors will require 100,0001. If they are to pay no other depositors, to what purpose are they to apply the remaining 900,0001., the sum they wish to borrow? It Cannot be that they do not expect receipts sufficient from their 9,000,0001. of assets to pay their current accounts. The auditors would, of course, state in their report how much of the 9,000,0001. consists of 'Government securities and balances due by other banks,' so prominently placed in the description of the assets. One other point I must advert to. The public will be forcibly struck with the fact 'hat there were no fewer than 10,000 poor eople depositors in this bank of sums not exceeding 501. Were these depositors attracted by the offer of a higher interest than they could have obtained in the savings-banks? When the economies of the poor are thus extracted from places of security to form capital for the beckless speculators to whom this bank have transferred their money, it is surely time the Legislature should interfere for their protection against the recurrence of similar practices." The quotations from New York by the Persia show a decided improvement in most of the principal railway securities. Erie were at 13S; New York Central, 69; Reading, 35 ; Panama, 77; Michigan Central, 49 : Michigan Southern, 15i, and Illinois Central, 87j. The Arabia, with dates to the 31St of October, was the next vemel expected at New York from this side. She took 205,0001., but also carried the news of the stoppage of the Liverpool Borough Bank. That of the suspension of Messrs. Dennistoiun, which occurred on the 7th of November, and was sent by the Niagara on that day, would niot arrive till the following week. Some heavy failures have occurred at Hamburg, which will be felt exiensively on the continent, and also in a limited degree in this country. The principal have been Ullberg and Crener and F. Blasss and Schomlurgk. The former were in the Swedish trade, with liabilities estimated at more than 1,000,0001. From Bremen the suspension is reported of H. Overbeck and Sassenberg and Meyer, but the liahilities in each case are only about 20,0001., and the assets about one-third of that amount. A meeting was held to-day of creditors of Messrs. Wilson, Morgan, and Co., wholesale stationers, whose suspension was announced on the 12th inst., when a state-ment was submitted by Mr. Chatteris, the accoumnant, showing a deficiency of 16,1301., the liabilities being 25,6291., and the estimated assets 19,4991. A long and somewhat angry discussion took place upon the offer by the insolvents of a composition of 7B. in the pound, in four instalments, it being contended that a dividend of lNs. at least should have been proposed. Dissatisfaction was also expressed that the capital brought into the concern by Mr. Smith, one of the partners and a minor, was advanced on security by his father, who appears as a creditor on the estate. Ultimately it was resolved to accept a composition of 8s. 6d., payable in three instalments at three, six, and nine months respectively from the lst of Decemher, the last instalment to be secured to the satisfaction of a committee of three creditors. A meeting of creditors of Mr. F. C. Perry, of the Rough Bay Furnaces, was held on Saturday at UA olverhanpton, when a composition of 10s. in the pgound wras proposed, payable either under the inspection of trustees to whom the estate should be conveyed, or in tbree instalments at 4, 8, and 12 months respectively, with a guarantee. After a long discussion the meeting was adjourned to the 8th of December. The liabilities were statedto be 76,7741., and the nominal assets 54,7051. The Journal de Constantinople announces the suspension at Smyrna of the house of Topuz and Co., with liabilities to the amount of about 40,0001. The North British Daily Mail states that branches have been opened of the Royal Bank of Scotland on the premises of the Western Bank at Forfar and Galashiels. At the latter town Mr. W. Rutherford, writer, has resigned the agency of the City of Glasgow Bank, and opened a branch of the Bank of Scotland. About 18,0001. in gold from Constantinople has been received to-day through the Messageries Imp6riales of France. The general business of the port of London has not been very active during the past week, owing chiefly to the easterly wind which has so long prevailed and prevented vessels working up the Channel. The number of vessels reported inward was 172, including 39 with cargoes of corn, flour, &c. There were also two vessels from China with 18,458 packages of tea and 3,195 bales of silk. 1,276 chests of tea have, in addition, been received from New York. The number of ships cleared outward was 102, including 14 in ballast; and the number on the berth for the Austialian colonies is 62. The principal city savings-bank, the London Provident Institution, Moorfields, exhibits by a report just issued the following satisfactory results of the operations of its official year completed on Friday last, the 20th inst :-The total of the wlthdrawals in the year, compound interest included, amounts to 295,6541., while that of the receipts, deposits, and simple interest from Government has been 257,3981. The number of accounts closed, including those of depositors deceased, has been 6,022; the nuLmber of new accounts opened, 6,148. The total number of accounts now open is 48,926. This institution, therefore, which under the pressure of the panic of 1847 showed a decrease of 397 in the number of its accounts, and of 117,1651. in its invested capital, lias come through the passing crisis with a diminution of but 38,1561. of its capital stock, and an actual increase of 126 in its number of deposit accounts. The aggregate of the balances and compound interest due to depositors at this moment is 875,6281.; while the bank's funded capital in the custody of the Commissioners for the Iteduction of the National Debt, as cei tified by their official voucher, is 880,6281., showlng a surplus of 5,0001. in excess of all liabilities.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARBES. Monday Evening. The railwaya-market opened at an advance. but afterwards receded below the final qutotations of Saturday. Towards the close, however, a partial recovery took place. Lancashire and Yorkshire, North-Eastern stocks, South-Eastern, Greata Nortbern, Caledonian, and Eastern Counties left off at a reduction of # to I per cent. The prospect of less favourable traffic returns, and the tendency of speculators to operate for lower prices, continue to exercise a prejudicial effect upon this class of securities Canadian shares were flatter, Grand Trunk declining I per cent. East Indian were firm, and in some of the smaller descriptions of Indian there has been a slight advance. French were generally lower, especially Southern of France and Paris and Lyons. American were in active demand; Illinois Central bonds and New York Erie improved, while the shares of the former receded $t. Mines were liat, with a limited inquiry. Joint-stock banks partially rallied from Saturday's depression, the low prices inducing the public to make investments; Loijdon and Vestminster, which at one period of the day marked 39, left off 40 to 42; Union, 18i to 19; and London Joint-Stock, 26 to 27; Ottoman Bank, however, showed increased weakness. The transactions in miscellaneous securities have been onnuaBaUy numerous; Electric Telegraph advanced, and a reduction occurred in Australian Agricultural and English and Australian Cnnr-r
THE DELIII PRINCES.-We have been favoured with the following exztracts from the letter of a young officer to his friends in England. It is dated Dugshaie, a place about 40 miles from Delhi, the 29th of September last:- A few days ago Captain Hodgson (of ours) went out and captured the King, and brought him in a prisoner. He is at present confined in his own palace. A few days later he went out again, and came up with the King's gons and grandson. He had only 100 native horsemen of his own regiment with him, and the enemy about 10,000, 3,000 of whom were folly armed Sepoys. flodgson saw it was of no use attacking them, so he sent an emissary to tell the princes that the game was up with them, and that they had better surrender, which they did after some time, aad came u to Hodgson, wrho immediately surrounded the carriage with his men. He sent for their arms, and, after hesitating some time, these also were given up with seven elephants and lots of stores. On reaching the garol Rodgsoni ordered the princes out of the vehicle ; tyhe, imagining all was righit for thensselves,, began (native-like) to talk, andl say they hoped there might te an InIuiry into their conducot.

ArALWAY INTELLGEzCLz. BRA C.R'TRNT. The provisional agreement between the directors of t ' s oornLany and the direotors of the LAncashire and Yorksh e and 15ast Lancashire Railway Companies for the sale by the former and parchase by the latter of the Blackbnrn X vlway was signed by the chairmen of the three companies on the 18th inst. It was agreed that the loan debt of the Blackburn Company should be fixed at 333,0001., and the rent charges to which the purchasing company were to be liable were fixed at 8901. per annum; that the prefere in, share capital of the Blackb rn Compaay should be taken a; 209,676t., and the ordinary Bhare capital at 616 6712., i l- cluding the sam aif 60,0714 arrears of dividend oo the preference capital, calculated to the 31st of December, 1857. That the purchasing companies should p t v to the Blackburn Company the sum of 69.001., being (with the sum of 5.0001. for sarplus land at Bla^kburn, mskina together 74,0001,) the estimated amouLnt of their generl liabilties, exclusive of their loan debt of 33.3,000. From the 1st of January, 1858, until the passing of an Act of Parliament for cArrying the agreement into effect the purchasing companies shall pay interest on the loan debt of 333,0001. and on the said sum of 69,0001. for general liahilities at the rate of 4A per cent. per annum, and the Blackburn Company bhall pay any difference or excess of interest to which mortgagees, bondholders, or other creditors may ba entitled beyond that rate, From the same date the purchsing companies shaU pay upon the preference share capital of 209,6711. a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum in perpetuity, unless the purchasing companies shall within two years from the passng of the intended Act elect to pay and shall pay off tdesaid amount of preference share capital at par. The above sum of 60,0711., being the amount of interest which will become due to the preference shareholders on the 1st of January, 1858, shall be capitalized, as forming part of the sum of 516,6711. ordinary share capital, and the same shall be apportioned among the preference shareholders of the Blackburn Company. The purchasing coDn. panies shal pay upon the ordinary share capital of the lackburn Oompany, amounting to 516,671t, the following rates of dividend :-viz., For the year 188, 11. per cent. ; for the year 1859. t, 10s. per cent.; for the year 1860, 24 per cent.; for the year 1861, 21. 10s. per cent., and after that period at the rate of 21. 10s. per cent. per annum in perpetuity, unless the purchasing companies shall, within fve years from the passing of the intended Act, elect to pay and shall pay off the ordinary share capital at the rate of 121. 10a for every 251. thereof. An appUeation shall be made to Parliament jointly by the three companies in the next session for an Act to carry into effect this agre emnent, the expenses of such Act being borne by the purohasing companies, unless the share. bolders of the Blackburn Company, or any of them, shall effectually oppose the passing of the Act, in which case the expenses of the application shall be borne by the Blackbarn Company. Until the passing of the intendqd Act the purchasing companies shall not be required to pay any money to the Blackburn Company, except such sums as th ^ Blackburn Company shall from the 18th of November, 1857, be entitled to receive under the agreement of the 1t or. April, 1850, now existing between the Blackburn and L ancashire and Yorkshire Companies. The acconnts under the agreement of the 1st of April, 1850, up to the 30th of September last shall be considered as adjusted (subject to the correction of any manifest errors which may be discovered therein), and the Blackburn Company shall abandon all claims in respect of traffic, incorrect working expenses, terminal charges, or other alleged breaches of the said agreement, and until the passing of the intended Act the accounts between the Lancashiro and. Yorkshire and Blackburn Companies shaU be made out and settled upon the principle now in operation.

GRAND TRUNK OF CANADA. The most expeditionsjouraey ever accomplished in Canada was recently performed on this company's line on the occasion of conveying his Excellency the Governor-General and suite froms Quebec to Toronto. The distance, 500 miles, was performed in 15 hours, including an hour for dinner at Ringston, and an hour and a half for other stoppages, the running time being 121 hours, or at the rate of 40 miles per hour. The arrsngemenf;s of the general manager gave great satisfaction, especially as the railway for the greater part of the distance consisted of a single line. TRAFFIC RETURNS. MUss P a- Mer.

NERaOES AND THE SLAVB TRADE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I do not wish to engage in an argument with "Expertus," for, if I did so, I should only take up your space by reiterating well-known faots and arguments, in which I have faith though "Expertus" has not; but I would gladly offer a few ideas on the matter in question. The besetting difflculty of England in her tropical pos. sessions is to find labourers who can endure a vertical sun and who are also willing to work. Those races of negroes of whioh the planters have most experience are constitutionally averse to work and deficient in motives to labour; but is n3 better material to bh had? I, for one, am sure that it exists, and I believe that by patient endeavour we ought to succeed in procuring it. It is i;opossible to read the works of any African traveller, who has penetrated far into the interior, 'without being struck at the delight taken by many tribe. in agricultural pursuits and in steady cbeerful labours Now, it appears to n.e that it is a great object to ferret out these superior races, to learn all about them, to ingratiats ourselves with them, and finally to tempt them over to our service. It is reniarkable how largely the merchant navy draws supplies from one small African race-the Eroomen, and how these men are promoted to posts of honour and diffi. culty above the beads of their white fellow-seamen. Thus, in American wbaling vessels it is usual to find that the harpooner is a Krooman. This race has a natural aptitude fur sea life and an instinctive adbesion to the Englishman, and I believe that among the endless diversities of African races it would not be difficult to find some who would get on equally well with our planters in the West Indies. One African differs from another, at least, as much as a Briton does from a Neapolitan, and the coast negroes with whom the tlave ships are chiefly familiar are, in great part, at tho very lowest mark in the scale of African humanity. The path before us is to push forwards the steps takenr by Barth and by Baikie, and not to allow the hopes raised among the native tribes by their respective missions to cool, We also greatly need a consistent political action towards the differcnt black tribes, and a friendly understanding with the French, who are too ready to be our antagonists in Senegal. A word from the Emperor of the French might put msatters on a far better basis in those reeions. OLIM AFRICANUS.
THE TEA TRADE, Nov. 23.-The deliveries in London estimated for the week were 611,7621b., which is a decrease of 76,7831b. comparod with the previous state. ment. RoYAI BRrrISH BANE DIRECTORs.-We are requested to state that Mr. Hlugh Hill, Q.C., is not one of the counsel for the defence in this case. SnUoTG.uR DEAT¶.-A most remarkable instance of fatality ocourred near Paugbourne on Friday. About midday polce-constable Tretmp, Barks coastabulary, saw a sturdy-looking man begging from house to house in tho village, and ordered him to desist. The man pursued his occupation until he came to some cottages near the sixth milestone, under Shooter's-hill, when, upon the polIce-constable's further interference, and threatening to take him into custody, the feUow swore he would show him what an Irishman could do, and struck him violently in the face. A scuffle ensued, in vhich both went to the ground, and blows were excbanged. At length the policeman found he was getting exhausted, the Irishman seizing him tightly by the collar and threatening to use his knife. Trump hert - upon loosened his hold, and the man imnmediately dlipped away from his grasp, and, rushing down to the ThameA, wbich flows close by the road, plunged Into the water. He swam wilth all tbe;ease of a waeor-spaniel, and struck out for the Oxfordshire side, looking back occasionally at his blffled captor with a kind of defiant or scornfnl gesture. Trump shouted to two men at work on the Oxfordshire side to secure the fugitive, and hastened away for a boat at hand, He obtained assistance, and was proceeding across, whlen the two men shouted that the man was drowned. and then coolly walked off as if nothing had happened. UJon police-constable Tramp arriving at the bank he found that the poor wretch had sunk within a very few yards of the shore, evidently from a sudden attack of cramp. In a verv brief time the bedy was rescued from the water, but life was extinct. Upouthe dead man werefound a pocket.knife abd a few coppers.-Berlshire Chronicle.

LONDOZY, 2UESDAY, NOVEMfBER 24,1857. Lectures-so callc:l because they are not read, but spoken-are among the phenomena of the day. We mean lectures by public men, by statcsmen, members of Parliament, Bishops, as, for example, by the Bishop of OxFoRD last week at Reading, and by other great persons. They are the phenomena of a particular part of tbe year-from the middle of August to Christmas, for with the New Year men begin to move to London, and to prepare for a more important arena. These lectures or speeches upon set subjects appear to be popular; the rooms are crowded, and the speaker is listened to with interest. This is the case, we believe; it is a fact which will appear to some fastidious persons who happen to have leisure, good libraries, and fair capacities for entering into their contents to require explanation, but if they will devote proper attention to it the matter is not altogether inexplicable. In the first place, all persons have not leisure or good libraries. Their stock of information is not superabundant, and therefore they have no objection to take advantage of pleasant, cheerful, lively means of increasing it. A large room full of well-dressed people, and brilliantly lighted, is a convenient accompaniment of instruction,-a pleasant disguise for mental improvement to adopt. If you get tired of the lesson you have your neighbours to look at, there is the diversion of mutual recognition in case the mind should feel itself filling too fast, and, above all, there is no examination at the end to be andergone. Comforting, cheering thought, for the volunteer pupils ! It is worth while reassuming our school attitude for a short interval, if it is only to enjoy this particular difference which attaches to it as reassumned-worth while going to a lecture to realize the full luxury of irresponsibility, and exert as often as it snits you the high privilege of not listening to a word of it. This is a glorious irn-munity, and gives the sensation of belonging to a privileged class, an intellectual aristoeracy. The absence of FA.LSTAFF'S bugbearcompulsion-gives a brightness to the scene, a holyday look, a sunshine, which is reflected from rows of eyes and faces-the pictures of legitimate irresponsibility. But there is nothing invidious in saying that perhaps information is not the principal motive which takes our townspeople to these exhibitions. There is nothing which the majority of us are more willing to leave entirely to chance than information; if it comes of itself, very good; if it does not, we will not go much out of our way to meet it. Most of us are not members of either House of Legislature, are not officials, are not expectants; we have not to answer questions, pacify complaints, refute charges, or undergo sifting examinations; there is no occasion for us to look at a blue-book as long as we live; we may know just as much and just as little as we like. We are not, then, disposed to put ourselves out of the way to acquire new facts. The great motives which take people to Town-halls, Lyceums, Atheneums, and other places to be lectured to are to hear a speaker 'and to see a man. There is an indescribable pleasure -which people take in hearing anything like good speaking-speaking which goes on without hesitation or ttops, which shows no hindrance at work, no disurbing cause operating in the machine, but displays a continuous prolonged creation of effective language. Such speaking as this is comparatively rare; you have ordinary Irish speaking, which is perfectly fluent without sense, and you have ordincry English speaking, which is sensible without fluency, but have not often the combination of the two, and still less often have you what can with any propriety be called oratory, which brings out the power of language, its strong and choice words, its vivid illustrations, and its weighty and energetic conmtructions. Good speaking almost always comes rather as a novelty, because we have so many indifferent specimens of the art in the intervals between the good that the latter have time to acquire a new freshness at each successive display, like spring or sunrise. This is to a certain extent the case even in the House, and, of course, still more the case in the country at large. Good speaking is thus decidedly I a treat, and it is appreciated as such-it is a particular exLibition of power with which men are not familiar. Exhibitions of power of any sort, higher or inferior, are always interesting as spectacles. T'here is good acting, which is a high intellectual exhibition; there i- good singing, which is also an intellectual exhibition, though not ranking so high; and there are good gymnastics, which are an exhibition of human power in the physical and corporeal department. All these are popular exhibitions, rs being demonstrations of human power and partaking of the marvellous; and good speaking 1 longs to this class of exhibitions. It is a continuous creation of language, the stream of which comes fresh each moment from the speaker's mind, and represents the actual working then and there of the speaker's brain, the whole machinery of which is in active revolution and play for your especial entertainment and benefit. You have thus the draught straight from the fountain head, and you have also the pleasure, as it were, of seeing the work in the very process of being made. There is something fascinating in the actual process of creation. The waterfaU enchains by the perpetual renewal of the faUing sheet, and keeps us half an hour simply looking at the uninterrupted continuity of the liquid formation. Thus, -with all its great defects, which are perceptible enough to any cultivated hearer, public speaking is one of the greatest treats you can provide for the middle and higher population of one of our towns. The extempore oration is of course often a rough production; it does not at all come up to our ideas of the perfection of language, but it fascinates and fetters attention as being extempore,-as displaying the energy of an actual creation on the spot. Lord DEnBY's is perhaps the best oratorical language we have,-we mean when he speaks his best; it is properly different from boo-k language, and yet does not run into the technical inflation and conventional bombast and professional phraseology which are the dangers of oratory. Mr. GLADSTONE'S is Parliamentary English-a very surprising and brilliant creation, but one that has gone through a medium of teelnicality or conventionalism, and does not come straight from the foe-nt of language. The Bishop of OXFORD'S oratory is open to the criticism that it is overstrained, and produces vivid pictorial effects at the cost of simplicity. This is no very severe or invi dious criticism, because in nine cases out of ten an orator who selects an exaggerated pbrase selects it because a simpler one does not come to hand. A ready and inexhaustible command of the simplest and truest words is, of course, the very triumph of oratory, and a most rare triuLmph. Still, with all its defects, oratory is oratory; it is an uncommon exhibition of power; it creates interest and sustains attent-on as such, and we are nob sorry that our provincial towns have now the opportunity of hearing most of our leading public speakers.
During the last war the attention of the public was bespoklen both by ourselves and by our correspondents to the importance of a topic which, in technical nomenclature, was styled " Military " Hfygiene." Less elaborately expressed, the subject concerned simply the health of the soldier in camp, in the field, or in any of the positions in which active duties were likely to place him. It was observed at the time that this subject had never obtained sufficient notice, that many pIOtective and remedial agencies were overlooked, and that a high rate of mortality among troops on an expedition was assumed too hastily as an inevitable incident of the service. As it happened, the wae ia the Crimea was eminently fraught with instruction in the matter; for our troops in the course of two years passed from the extremity of suffering and weakness to the utmost excellence of condition, while, on the other hand, our alies, who in the first months of the campaign had far surpassed us in the success of their arrangements, fell victims before the close of the expedition to disorders and calamities as serious as our own. Now, as all the natural conditions of climate and atmosphere were constant both for the French and ourselves throughout the whole course of operations, it is evident that the conditions remnaining within our own control which could produce, in both cases alike, results so singularly contrasted, must be of, very great importanee indeed. If the invaliding and mortality in the two armies had been due to the air of the Crimea or the nature of the service, we should have found similar returns at particular seasons from the beginning of the war to the end, not to mention that the accumulated pressure would have borne harder upon our troops in 1856 than in 1854. The very contrary of this, however, was the case. That the sufferings of the British could not be due to the Crimean atmosphere was plain from the fact that the French, on the same ground and under the same sky, were healthy and weeU to do; while that their misfortunes, again, at a later period, were equally independent of irremovable cautses appeared as plainly from the salubrity of our camp by their side. An authentic statement of the casualties of the French army during the period in question has just been given to the world from the pen of Dr. ScRrvE, the Physician-General to the expedition, and this publication-the candour and fulness of which bespeak a most judicious courage on the part of the Government-enables us to point the moral of the story even more forcibly than before. The total numbers of all ranks despatched from France to the East during this brief contest amount to no fewer than 309,278, and of these as many as 200,000 entered the hospitals of the army for professional treatment at some time or other. Out of the whole force, therefore, two-thirds, in round numbers, came to some injury reqoiring medical aid. When we proceed, however, to analyze these figures the results show that these easualties must, to a great extent, have been avoidable. The iramediate effects of war are reducible to comparatively small proportions. Only one-fourth of the entire I number of cases aroSe from wounds received in action; the rest were due to disease, and, what is more, to disease wbich in all human probability admitted to a greater or less extent of prevention or control. Dr. ScrrvE gives us the means of I following the course and consequences of the suCcessive visitations by which these painful sufferings were produced. The firast outbreak was that of cholera, which appeared in the French army at Gallipoli, at Varna, in the Dobrudsoba, and at Athens,causing, especially in the Dobradscha, very considerable mortality. Now, as cholera was epidemic in the year 1854, and as it raged with as much violence in the departments of France itself as in the provinces of European Turkey, we may perhaps separate this item from the general account, as not attributable in the main to any ineidents of the expedition. This scourge, however, after ceasing for a time, reappeared in the camp before Sebastopol at the beginning of 1855, andI thenceforward seemed to play its part less like t a special plague than an ordinary malady induceda by suffering and privation. With cholera came scurvy-a sure expression of physical distress, and frostbites-that dreadful affliction vhich, under the name of " Gelatio," figured so prominently in our own medical reports. As a natural sequel and attend- I ant of these calamities, typhus fever then set in, but at this period the resources of the medical staff had not been overtaxed, and the disease wa. fairly beaten out of the field by the skill and' energy of the French surgeons. All this while our own soldiers had been suffering so fearfully that nothing but the invincible sentiment of duty could have kept them up to their work, and it still standa recorded as one of the many distinctions earned by particular individuals that they " never missed a turn in the trenches." At length the tide began to set the other way. The reports of our own correspondents, confirmed by the statements of others visiting the spot, roused the patriotism as well as the indignation of the country to its highest pitch, private generosity came in aid of Government supplies, and before the middle of the year 1855 our army had seen its worrt days. By the commencement of the year following it had assumed a totally new aspect, and when the conclusion of peace occasioned its return to England, it reappeared on these shores, not like the unfortunEte victims from Walcheren, but in the very highest state of health, efficiency, and dicipline. With our allies, on the contrary, the worst of the suffering set in after the hard work of the war had been finlsbr l. Sebastopol was taken in September, 1855, but tIhe success brought no improvement to the condition of the French army; scurvy decimated its ranks, and when, six months after the victory, typhus again broke out, the medical staff could no longer subdue it, as before. More than 19,000 men are stated, in the report we quote, to have bcen then struck down by this unsparing malady. It is certainly interesting to observe the re. spective advantages and disadvantages attaching to the English and French systems of m!litary administration-to remark- how, at the outset, our allies enjoyed a superiority of condition from their maintenance of a large military force on a regular war footing, and, as 3rust needs be ackaowledged, from the better organization of their army,-while, as things went cn, our inexhaustible conmmand of money and resources, coupled with our national faculty of straggling upwards under difficulties, at length turned the tables in our favour. But this is not the moral wbich, on the present occasion, we desire to recommend. We -wish rather to point out from tbe combined examples of the two armies how very large a proportion of what are regarded as war casualties arise from c;rcumstances independent oF war. In the case of our own army the canton ol Sebastopol worked the least part of the mischief; in fact, through a cons'derable period it signified scarcely anything to the condition of the troops that the R>ussians were in front of them. They suffered not from bajonets or bullets, but from overwork, e.cessive exposure without Fafficient protection, a:nd want of proper food, clothing, and comforts. -Under thes same privations the same mortality might be created any winter on the ridges of Aldershott. iu the case of the French-though we are not, of course, quite so conversant with the interral economy of their army-we learn enough from Dr. ScivE's report to show us that preventible causes are chargeable with the chief proportion of the evils recorded; indeed, it is plainly stated that the wors: visitation of all-that of typhus fever towards the close of the expedi:on-was engendered by tlhe infection arising from the refuse of the camp. These considerations are well wol.h the attentioa of our aul'iorities and of the country at the present maoment, when soldiers are valuable, and our military establislirnents likely to be enlarged. Common prueence suggests that in preparing for an ircreased demzand we should look to economy of expenditure as well as to improved supplies. Coammon humanity, too, and common wisdom point in the same direction, for, while we are iinperatively bound to protect the detenders of the country from all avo-dable sufferings, this service will be all the more readily accepted when it is known that none of its removable hardsb;ps will be allowed to remain.
As the attention of the public is rarely absorbed by more than a single subject at a time, and as one question is very apt to drive another altogether out of the field, we may perhaps be justified in doubting whether many people in these days of Indian triumphs and monetary convulsions are gin ng themselves much concern about the Slave Trade. Yet this nefarious traffic still subsists es much as ever, to the disgrace of humanity, and if its proportions are not quite so shoclking as in days pant, they have recently shown a marked tendency to expansion. Moreover, the case has its financial as well as ite moral aspect. Until the extinction of the trade shall have permitted the growth of legitimate commerce ard enlightened views among the negro tribes, we are called upon to maintain on the coast of Africa a force of which the yearly cost was ofifciafly com- puted but a short time since at half a millioa sterling. Now, as the annual expense of a regiment 1,000 strong is but some 30,0001., this sum would enable us to raise and pay 15 additional battalions of infantry without a shilling's increase of taxation; or, to take another view of the matter, it would provide every year for the relief of the Indian sufferers twice as much as the generous contributions of Britain, aided by many offerings from Europe and Asia, have been found to supply. Our resolute efforts to suppress this execrable and costly traffic have accomplished much. The trade is now almost confined to the single island of Cuba, but this island is so spacious, the addiction of its inhabitants to the commerce in question is so strong, and the high prices commanded by tropical produce have operated with such stimulating power, that the result has been an unquestionable increase in the exports of slaves from the African coast. This increase has of course not been contemplated with indifference either by philanthropists or statesmen, but the expostulations provoked have in one respect taken a wrong direction. We have been assured on behalf of General CoxCnA, the Captain-General of Cuba, that the reports circulated in Madrid with regard to his connivance at the traffic are not even traceable to the suspicions arising from former examples, but that they were due solely to the malicious or interested representations of his political opponents. These assurances, we feel bound to say, have been sustained by independent official testimony from Cuba itself, and at home also we have found the policy of General CoNcni's administration in respect of the Slave Trade exempted from censure on competent and impartial authority. The difficulties we have ourselves experienced in the work of suppression render General CoNcHA's failure in similar attempts aU the more intelligible, without the necessity of imputing to him either negligence or connivance. If he cannot stop the import, we cannot stop the export, of these dreadful cargoes. We have much the same task before us. We have to blockade an enormous length of coast with the consciousnets that advantage will be successfully taken of the least relaxation of the cordon. He has had to watch some 2,000 miles of shore, pierced with creeks in every direction, and to counteract the devices of a population evely man of which is against him. It is the old law of supply and demand, and the demand is so strong that it becomes hard to intercept the current of supply attracted to satisfy it. We are informed that the Captain-General has sent one officer of eminence to Spain for trial, and that the gaols of the island are full of offenders incarcerated for breaches of the law; but such is the universal impulse, and such the dominion of self-interest, that our efforts on one side of the ocean ard his on the other are nullified together, and slaves are shipped on the coast of Africa and landed on the coast of Caba in spite of all that the combined Equadrons and General CoNcHA can 2o in prevention of the traffic. But wbat is to be the end of all tnis ? Observe how one point after another appears to 1-1 gained, ard still without the desired consummation. First, the assent of European States to the abolition of the traffic was formally attained, so that, according to treaty engagements, there ought to be no purchasers of slaves, and consequently no slave commerce. Next, in order to bring material force in aid of moral conviction, a combined squadron was stationed on the African coast with the mission of clearing the seas of this detestable traffic, if it shor'd ever be attempted. At length we obtain ti e co-operat-on of a Captain-General on the otber side of the pasc ge, who exerts all his power to stop from disembarking the very cargoes whie'i we tx y to stop from embarking ; andyet the re .alt is, that the Slave Trade acquires fresh vivacity as prices rise, and more blacks are impoited into Cuba row than were imported some time ago. Of coarse, under such circumstances there can be no release from our oblig.tions, ard for the sake of this interminable patrol we are compelled to keep upon a thanklevi ard unhealf'iy service a force of ships and men which, if f oy had been in the Indian waters, might have tur.red the scale at an earlier period against the murderous mutineers. We do not Eay tbe duty can bs evaded; on the contrary, these very outbreaks show the vitality of the traffic and tbe necessity for keeping it down, but 500,0001. a-year, or even half that sum, is a high price to pag fcfailure. We have once or twice suggested that, instead of confining our attention exclusivelv to the point of supply, it might possibly be serviceable to take into consideration the po;nt of demand. After all, there is nothing unnatural iL a man's not liking to be ruined, 's:iethe- he is an English merchant wanting bank-noLes or a tropic-l agriciulturist wanting 'sboanrerz. We, too, on oar side of the At antic want the prodace which the tropical cultivatow alone can raise, and it is simply because we are rzady *o buy sugar that the Cubans set General CONCHIA at defiance in their resolution to grow it by any manner of means. Over our own West Indies we had so strong a hold that we coald do as we pleased, and it pleased us thau the estates of tlhe co!on!es should go out of cult*ation rather inan that they should be cultivated by the only labour available-that of slave.. Certaznly we took a share in the sacrifice, ,or we paid) ' , 0,00,0301 towarls tlielosses incurred, but other nations are not liLely altogether to admire the results or to 'ollow the exanple. But, if they do not follow it, aed we cannot in ercept their suppl:es by sheer force, what are the prospects before us? Cannot some device or some provision be imangined which will leave trop-cal planters with sone alterna:ive between ruin and slavedealing ? Slave labour FS notoriously not cheap labour. Planters are used to it, and in the ! cultivation of certain crops it is conven-ent, on account of the resouinas which it'yiclds at particular periods of the year, but it is always a costly agency, ard jtait now irore costly than ever. No men in his senses would 'ona prefer to buy a slave for 3001. if be could hire a labourer whose passage had cost a thirtieth part of the money. As to the eventual balarce of advantages, that question has been settled by the experiments in the Maur:tius, where free labour has actuallv done more than slave labour has ever been known to do. We know full well the remonstrances to be anticipated from our veteran Abolitionists, who denounce the idea of free negro labour, ard with some plausibility, as only a cover for legalized slavedealing. What ttey say aboat the operation of such a system upon the African coast has very possibly some foundation, but it should not be forgotten that oar cboice Lies between evils, and evils only. If it is an evil to retrace our steps, even in so small a degree and for so good a purpose,-if it is an evil to revive bad passions in the breasts of African chiefs, and to show ourselves as the purchasers or purveyors of negroes in the very markets -we have been attacking for years, it is alto an evil to be expending money and life in a task which does not prevent cargoes of blacks from bei-ng carried across the ocean as befo-e, and to be relying entirely upon a system of repression which, even when we have the advantage of a zealous co-operator in the Captain-General of Cuba, caunot ho rendered successeful or: effective.

THE PENINSULAR MAIL& (BY XLECTRIC AND INTERNATIONAL TXLXGRAPH.) SOUTHAMPTON, MO.NDAY EVENING. The Peninsulr and Oriental Compuny's 4~eamer Tagrt, Captain Christian, has arrived with mails of the foUowir, dates, in charge of Lieutenant Gre-ille, R.N., Admiralky agent :-Gibraltar, 14th; Cadiz, 15th ; Lisbon, 19th; and Oporto and Vigo, 20th, She brings 17 passmngers, apecle and bullion value 8,7321., and a large cargo of oranges, lemons, raisins, figs, plums, egge, chestnuts, &c. At noon on the 22d, in lat. 47 38 N., long. 6 10 W., passed the steamship Volga, and at 1 p.m. a full-rigged steamship, with topgallantmast down, steerlng to the south-west, supposed to be the Nemesis. The screw steamer Aurorawas at Oporto, and the Alham bra at Vigo, with the outward mails. The Tagus had very fine weather out and home, but in the Channel fresh westerly winds and thick weather. There were no British ships of war at Lisbon when the Tagus left. The Lisbon exchanges for bills at three months were quoted as follows :-London, 54i, bills over and somcthing done at 54i; Paris, 515; Amterdam, 434; Hamburg, 48^o; Genoa, 514, with a limited supply of both bills atd money upon continental places. Three per Cents. wct.. quoted-Registered, at 464 to 47; Coupons, 46 to 461; Deferred, 26 to 27. But these rates were nominal for wan', of buyers, who would probably be able to Invest at lower rates. Bank of Portugal continued at 1124 to 1 per cent. premium, and Oporto Bank shares at 22 to 224. Our Lisbon correspondent writes as follo wrs:- "I t has been reported here that the Government is about to authorize the Bank of Portugal to raise its rate of discount above 5 per cent., and to restriot iti discounts to bills at two instead of three months as pro. vided in its charter, but the inquiries I have made leal to the conclusion that no alteration is at present contemplated beyond a Government guarantee to the Bank in order to induce it to renew to a greater extent than Its charter adm;ts hills left unpaid by parties who cannot expect t3 meet them until the fever panic ceases, The principal Portuguese banks ecem at present to be in a satisfactory state, and I do not think the Government will entertain any question of alteration in discounts uantil tho Cortes meet on the 9th of December." We have had nothing but southerly winds and rair, which has not tended to reduce the fever during the last ti days. The new cases from the 8th to the 17th were 1,877; deaths, 773; and cures, 1,275; aganAst 2,063 new cases, 717 deaths, and 1,165 cures during the previous ten days up to.the 8th, the result being a reduction of 186 in the nea cases and an increase of 56 deaths and 110 cures. The daily returns of new cases vary considerably. Those of the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th being 217, 157, 229, and 174. It Is observed they are generally less iu cold, clear days, and all anxiously hope for a continuous norther!y breeze, which we generaUy have at this time of the year, to relieve us from the fever altogether. Large sb. scriptions have been collected at Lisbon, Oporto, and othe' places, sad every effort is made to relieve the more needy fever patients. The Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon is among the recent deaths; but few British subjects have been lately attacked." Gibraltar advices are of the same date as these by the Indus.

CAMlBRIDG2E, Nov. 23. The Vicc.Cbancellor met the members of the Senate in the Art Schools to-day, to consider the proposed new statutce for the Lady Mrgaret and the Norrissian PIJleosorrhips of Divinity. With regard to the first, the Cor neil proposed that the right of votiug in the election of r. Prole-,or shall be vested only in those Bachelors of Divinity and Doctors of Divinity who, having been prcviously Mlasters o. Arts, enjoy the right of aufEage in the After some goneral oboervations from the Vice-Chaucellor, Mr. RoBY, of St. John's, objected to the proposed mode of election. It had been rejected once by the Senate, and he did nob. Ece why it should not be so again uDon the same grounds; becaase the thcological faculty was not now only among the B.D.s ard D.D.s. He believed these degreea hr -i ceaEad to be a faculty. T1he VICE-CHANCELLOR said he was aware the degrees in Divinity wera not now the ssme tests on that subject as fo'merly, bat he trusted they would be made so. The Vice-Provost o. KELN's said the degree of B.D. was not obtained without tbe psr'ornmance of the exerclses. Fe did not mean to overrate these, and confessed they were not what they ought to be. He had not the same feeling rgsaist the Colleges of Trinity and St. John's as others appr rc i to show; but he thought the old board preferable to the proposed new one, as the Docaor's degree would be so sedom taken, and he tbought a board elected for electing would find mole acceptance with the Senate. Professor BROWSE said it was no proposal of a new board. The Council recommended nothiug of the kind. The V1CE.CHAINCELLOR said the proosl as it stood was only to clear up a doubt. Professor SFLWYw said the CounCIl had guided themselvc i by the ctle thaw where the old boards were good they should remaiu, and as to remarks which had been made respecting the B.D. degree, he eaw no reason why this should disqualify them. lie bad no doubt that in the cbanges which were taking place in the University an improvement in that decreo would be called for, and effected. The Master of S., JoHN's said he feared they cDuld hardly satisfy Mr. G. Williams, the Vice-Provost of Kns - but it must be ramembered that the Lady Margaret Prokessorahip wasonly accidentally affected by college statutes. The college influencs would be purely accidental; besides, the degrees in Theology might be made as stringent as possible. As far as he rer- embered at Oxford matters remained aq they were. Besides, this board ought to recomnend itself to MLr. Willinins, who on a former occasion had argued Etrongly for clerical electors. This board insured clerical electors indeed more, for it was more than mere ordination. The object of the Council was to clear up a doubt. Mr. GLOVER (of Trinity) asked if the subject could not be deferred till efter they hkd seen what the University meant to do w Ith the B. D. degrees ? The VIex-CHANCELLOR answered in the negative, and s-id that when the B. D. was made what it ought to be, as be trusted it would, there would be fewer of these degrees the board would so become smaller and better. Mr. E3!ERY (of Corpus) wisbed to know if it were the intention of St. John's College to give up the necessity of proceeding to the degree o B. D., whereby the influence of that colk ge woald be lets? And, as to impzovingthe deree, be thou bt people would not submit to be examined at that time of lfe. Mr. RoBy made some further remarks, in which he co-nplained that the Ieasons of the Council were not given to the Senats. The VICE-CHANCELLOR said the CouncI felt they had a duty to pe'form in fram",g the statutss of the University; it ws tieir object to do so in the most effialent manner they could; sad it could Ecarcely be expected that they should state their reasons. This would Involve the publication of a volame. No ameudment having been moved, the pror,d repeal of the statute wbich requires a fresh election of the Norris. sian Professor every five years was considered. Nothirg being moved, the VIc-CuAHAcELLO: read the proposed statute for the government of the two Professors. tre Vice-Provost of IZG'a understood the proposed hoard of management was not satisfactory to the Professothemselves, as they were no' placed on the board. Mr. C,%rmPi, of Queen's, said it must be remembered that the future Professors were human; they might become lazy, ard he thought it better not to place them on the board. There would in that case be two e'ements at work, the elected and the cx officio, which would give rise to divisions. Professor CnALLIS objected to the remarks of Mr. Campton. There ought to be confidence in the Profesors Professor BnowNx And Mr. ADASIs, of Pembroke, took the came view, with whom the VicE.CHANcELLoR agrecl, Professor SELsY.wv thought the Professors should form rrt of the board, and that this should be provided for by the statute. Mr. DIxoN, of Clare, finallyU moved as an adendment, "T hat the University should appoint a board conistinpo of the Professors, and such persons as the Senate might approve."
THE UNITED JS7TES. (PROM Our 2mw YORK CORPOET.1 NEW YORK, Nov. IL Ourgaytown is thisweek the sCene of a new excitement more lively than anything we have yet hd. It is often sid that we take our tone from Parls. The gaiety of the streets, the out-of-door life, the variety of the amusements, the bustle and animation upon the promenades, are all supposed to fumnish a reflex not unlike the brilLiancy of the great European metropolis. The comparison may be carried yet farther. The excitemnents of the Bourse have been more than parodied in the panic in Wall-s-reet, the effects of which are still pros. trating the commercial world and adding daily to the list of bankrupts. As all the ruling world there, whether in fasbion or politics, have " takten a shy' at the fascinating hazard of the Bourse, so here the same classes have dipped heavily into Spece. lative time contracts at the Board of Brokers, but with more disastrous results. And nowr we are in the midst of another scene, taken from the dramatic life of Paris, which for the tinie throws into the sbade even the exciting events of the past two months. The bread riots have commenced, as yet without asuming the form of riots, or, indeed, any tangible form, owing to the vigorous manner in which they have been met; but a spirit has b3en manifested that timid people think completes the parallel between New York and Parismore perfectly than the most devoted admirer of French customs could desire. The financial embarrasments nata. rally fell first, and most severely, upon all branches of creative industry. All heavy contract for building were suspended (as in London two y6ars since), and as the growth of NevwYork has been keeping pace with London a great many mechanics and working men were at once thrown out of employ in that way. The large manufacturing establishments in every branch of business were in like manner curtailed. People would not make whattheycould not selL Thus artisans in every branch were suddenly discharged and deprived of the means of supporting themselves and their families. The morning journals were for weeks filled with the details of the ciutailment, showing that thousands, or tens of thousands rather, of the population of New York were deprived of the meansof sustenance; and as such persons are rarely much ahead ia the world a loss of employment was literally a loss of bread. Nearly or quite onc half of the labouring population of New York is foreign. The Herald gives the list of voters as one-half foreign, one-half native. If this be correct, it wonld show that more than half the workingpopulation is of foreign birth. Alarge part of it is German-whole quarters o; the town are as thoroughly Germanic as Berlin or the cleanly capital of the Rhine. They came here unde the pressure of the Revolution of 1848, impregnated with the Simonistic views which then convulsed Europe. There is also a very lairge Irish element, which byhanging together has made itself formidable in political organization, and has contrived to get it* hand deep iuto the municipal treasury. The mere premence of possible sffering (for there has really been little or no actual suffering) to such classex one would think would be enough to excite appre. hension without fanning the flame. Unfortanately there comes just at this time a municipal election under the new charter, by which the possession of the city offices and the control of the city treasury is to be decided. There is also good reason to suppose that the new charter was enacted by political opponents for the sake of dispossessing the present inenmbent of the mayoralty. The Democratic party, under these circumstancss, have re-nominated him, with every prospect of re *lecting him, as well through their own strength as the inability of their opponents to unite. He, howevex was so imprudent, two or three weeks since, as to send in a message to the Board of Aldermen and Common Council, recommending the purchase of flour and other necessaries of life by the municipality, to be distributed to workmen in return for services to be rendered by them on public works to be projected for the sake of giving employment to the unemployed. It was also savoured with sundry vague generalities, tending to excite distrust between the different classes These hings took wonderfully with the foreign population. They took up the cry of relief at the public expense, and held great meetings in the public squares, where, with pipes and cigars, they lamented the absence of bread, and resolved that bread they would have. They called upon the Mayor to perform his promise of giving them work; and when he refused, from inability, they denounced him, and threatened violence to him personally, and to attack the City-hall. He got alarmed, and sent for a large police force to protect himself and the city property. The day before yesterday the Mayor's message was made the subject of action in two Boards. The Board of Aldermen resolved that it was " inexpedient to adopt its suggestions." The other Board adopted the suggestions so far as io supply work, and recommended the governors of the almshouses to lay in an extra supply of provisions " in anticipation of extreme destitution among the labouring population." They also passed an ordinance requiring bread to be sold by weight, and the initials of the baker to be stamped upon each loaf. This was not the relief exr2eted or desired, and, accirdirgly, yesterday a hostile demonstration was threatened. The danger was unquestionably exaggerated, partly by fear, and partly for political purposes. I mixed among the mobs (if peaceable assemblies can be called mobs), and saw or heard nothingto lead me to suppose that there west any purpose of immediate violence. The language of the speakers was threatening, bu. it did not seem to be responded to by the people; nor, so far as I heard them speaking to each other, did I gather that they thought of violence. The authorities thought otherwise. The AssistantTreasurer telegraphed to Washington for a force to protect the Sub-Treasury and Custom-house. It was furnished at once. The marine corps quartere I at Governour's Island were brought up to the city, end are now quartered in the basement of the Custom-house. The State Militia, too, happened to be out on a parade, and made a seasonable display of strength. They formed in the upper part of the city, along the lines of the spacious fifth avenue, in front of the beautiful houses ia which many of them lived, and which they might be calied upon to protect. They marched slowly down Broadway, and reached the Park about sunset. By the time they reached there the whole trouble was over, except that there was an ix.mense crowd of many thousand curious spectators remaining. The demonstration was an imposing one, and effectual for maintaining peace, even had peace been seriously threatened. But it is not to be concealed that the public mind is feverishly excited, and that the peace of New York may before many weeks rest on the arm of military power. There is no doubt that that arm is strong enough to support it, let what will happen. The present demonstration on the part of the rioters has been absurdly weak. Ihe authorities have the prestigo of a bloodless suppression of any manifestation of discontent. If more energetic measures become necessary, they will be used without scruple and with equal effect. I hope notbing more will be necessary. There was too much of the ludicrous about the proceedings of yesterday to forebode immediate danger. The repol t of Captain Van VlAet upon what he saw and heard at Great Salt Lake City has induced the Government to abandon the expedition for thin
TO THE BDITOR OF THE TMEBS. Sir,-It is very clear that had Neil, Nicholson, Wilson, and Hlavelock been popular diners-out in London, knownat White'sandBrookes's, constant atterdants atNewmarket, stewards of the Jockey Club, and much-revered at Melton as quick men to hounds, their achievements would long ere this have received a very different recognition from the advisr of the :Fountain of Honour. But as they happen to be men unknown in fashionable circles, who, embracing in early lhfo the profession of arms, have adhered to it clo-ely ever since, earning what little advarcement they have obtained by steadfast endurance of cliw ate srd fearle-ss discbarge of duty on all occasions, they are to be fobbed off with rewards which would scarcely satisfy the cravings of the military ' family" of an influential nobleman commanding an army of reserve on the Ourragh during an iavanlon panic. Neill and Nicholson are gone. Wilson and :Havelock, happily, survive. From the day on which the elder brother of the latter rode lleadlong on the Bidassoa among the French, to encourage the hesitating Spaniards, who coald not resist foilowing the fair-haired daredevil with ahouts of " Viva el chico blanco," to that on which Be perished a grayhaired colonel at Ramnuggur, the British army could boast no better or more chivalrOUi soldier than he. But he rose not to high rank or bigh honours, because he had no R. s. d. whcrewith to pay for them. In such matters the inexorable motto of tbe Horse Guards is " No 'Crust." Sir Henry Havelock, at last K.C.B., entered the army 42 years since, in 1815. His varied and ibrilliant Eervices have been of late so often recmpitu. lated by the public press that I will not aga;n enumeiate them. A Queen's offlcer, his life haq lceen principally spent in India, wheic be hlss aenisted in almost every great battle which hes boen fought there during the last 40 years. An ac^omplished as well as a gallant soldier, he has servcd much on the staff. But no't being possensed c' anoney wherewith to purchase promotion and reward, Henry Ha-velock, toiling manfully and auccesfaUlly under the hot suns of Burmah, Persia, and India, aclually remained in the grade of a subaltern from 1815 tiU 1838-23 years. Turn we now to the most influential and liberal purchaser emong our Crimean Gererals. Let us see how his lavish investments of cash bave fructifiedwhat a military position they have created for himagainst what obstacles, tco o Major-General the Earl of Cardigan, K.Q.B., uomnmander of the Legion of Honour, and Inspector-General of the British Cavalry, is Etated by Burke to be in his (i tst year. As he did not enter. the army until 1824, he must have obtained his cornetcy at the ripe age of 27,-a circumstance which of itself would have altogether excluded from the service a less wealthy and influential candidate. But to candidates such as his Lordship the Horse Guards never oppoce any obstacles at all. Two years' home service and several thousand pounds obtained for Lord Cardigan his troop and a grade which Havelock could only reach after 23 years' active service in the :East. Four years more-all of peace seivicesaw his Lordship in command of a crack cavalry regiment, while Havelock's lieutenantcolonelcy was only obtained after 31 years' active service, in Barmanh-on the Indus-in Affghanistan -at Ghuznee-at Cabul and at Jelialabad-in Kohistan-at Maharaj pore-on the Satlej-at Moodkee, Ferozeshah, and Sobracn. Two horses were ahot under him at Moodkee and one at Sobraon. Think of such services as these, Sir, and of Lord Cardigan's, and then explain on what piincip!e the fortune of war in Whitehall has shone so genially on her favourite Hussar, and so sparsely over the brilliant India veteran. Lord Cardigan's stibseqluenit career is too well known to render it necessary for me to recapitulate Its very salient events. Suffice it to sa; that in spite of such a career his Lordship was seleot3d on the breaking otut of the war with Russia as second in command of the cavalry of the expedition. His services with that army were very brief. le was among the last to join it, and among the first to leave it. Ilis achievements are matters of b:story. Official papers record his eternal squabbles with b;s superiors, in which he was always pisnounced to be in the wrong; his famous iaconnaissance in the Dobrudscha; and his critical conduct of the perishing Light Brigade from on board a comfortable yacht in Balaklava harbour, seven mailes distant from his soldiers. Yet for this questionable career, plus a good -many thousand pounds, Lord Cardigan has far outstripped in military position and in the receipt of high honoura the gollant,accomplished, and experienced Havelock, whose steadfast and soldierlike course has never once been soiled by a single stain. The British nation is ever reproached by her miiitaary servants-by those in possession of the loave3 and fishes, I mean-with ingratitude. This charge was advanced when the public evinced their ehame and disgust at the gross partiality exhibited in the distribution oi honours and rewards during and -subsequent to the Crimean war. We daily saw them lavished upon men whom wVe knew to be utterly unworthy of them; and we remonstrated loudly and bitterly, but without success. But are we ungrateful now ? Do we protest against public monuments and pensions to Neill and Nicholson, and to their families? Is there a single Englishmian who would not with exceed -g joy rejoice to read in the Gazette that a peerage and a pension of 2,0001. a-year had been a.varded to Wilson of Delhi, and Havelock of Lucknow and the Ganges? I am, Sir, your obedient servant. A UVIVJAN.

Johni's Now Brunswick, on a dark night, a man walked off one of the wharfs in that city when the tide was out. He groped his way along in the mud, but, instead of taking a course which would extricate him from his unpleasutt predicament, he wandered up among the iles beneath the whaf, where, of course, he became more bewildered thau ever. The rising tide m ade him consciouls of his danger, and by shouts and noise be was enabled to attrzact the attention of persons passing in the vicinity, but too late for mecees. As the tide rose he climbed to the top of the piles, and through a small aperture in the wharf, soRelent or one of his arms, he was enabled to inform them of his situation. His position and feelings can be imagined when the water was every moment rsing around him, and he could not be extricated.

INDIAN MUTINIBS. THE FALL OP DELTIL The following is from an Engineer officer engaged ln the siege:-- "Delhl, Sept. 28. "You I see by the date of my letter that the task in which we have been so long engagd is at kst acoomplishce. Delhi w aaulted, and a portion of the city captured by us on the 14th of September. Our progress from this date was slow till the 20th, when the city was evacuated by the Inutlueers, and we found ourselves in possesdion of the whole. Thus had ended what I suppose fature genera. tioas will consider one of the most extraordinary sieges In history. You wil by the time this reaches you have learnt something more of the actual diffioulties that we have had to contend against than our last English letters show ; but IOU cannot have the same notionx of the wonderful way iu which our small force has been protected by Providence as we who have been participators in all that has passed. Yot wll hear a great deal, I will acknowledge, but there are small details whioh strike us so forcibly at the time of the occurrence, and these are so innumerable that the most careful narrator wll fail to tell all. There are so many calamities have befallen us since the 10th of May that one felt tempted to look upon as irretrievable at the time, and which so short a time has sufficed to point out as the only remedies against evils of far greater magnitude. So often has our position seemed perfectly hopeless, and so wonderful have been our deliverances, that I cannot conceive the most sceptical man denying events to have been brought about by a power far above human. I will only attempt to point out to you some of the most convincing proofs of what I assert :-Firstly, when the mutiny broke out, see how Gencral Hewitt was blamed for his inactivity. The outcry was natural, and no one can deny that he was the most incompetent man that could have filled such a post. Bnt let us for an instant suppose that somne more able man had commanded at Meerut, and even that the mutiny had at its first outbreak at Meerut been quelled. Subsequent events and disclosures have only proved to us that the outbreak has bcen premature, and that had it been overcome at the time ib would probably have come upon us at the appointed day vith a force that none of us could kave hoped to withstLd. Secondly, let us take the faac that the mutineers on the 10th of May found the Watergate (to the south of the palace) open, when all others had been shut against them. I have heard many deplore this fact; but let us suppose it otherwise. Let us suppose that all the gates in the city had been closed, and that all ingress hrd been impracticable. The results, I think, must have been far more lamentable even than they were. The mutireers (I think without a doubt) wouald not have spent much tme in fruitless endeavours to enter the clty, but have ruEhed straight up to the cantonments, where they would have been joined by the Native Infantry regiments there quartered. The surprise would have been most complete, and under the circumstanoes few indeed, if any, of us could have escaped from cantonments, and with tho prosps3, of the immense plunder in the city I do not think they would have wasted muoh time in effecting an entrance, which would then have been most easy, and how would It have fared with those in the city? Thirdly, we have always lamented the delay in the assistance of the Buropean force from Bengal reaching us. The event has shown how far more necessary these same Buropeans wero down-cmuntry even than up here. Fourthly, we have three times (previously to the 14th of September) been on the point of assaulting Delhi. This was very shortly after our first arrival here on June 8th. Onone occaslon (June 12th) we had even sent out the rlvance column. I was the senior engineer witth the column, and virtually had the command of It. My iustrue tions were to advance through a portion of the suburbs of Delhi (IO;hengunge, Paharipore, and those vlllages to the right of our position on the ridge) in close column, and when within 400 yards of the city waUs to extend to the right and left in skirmishing order. The suburbathat Iallude to, I must teU you, are cbiefly oomposed of loopholed en. closures and aerais which you would think had beenr built expressly for defensive purposes. The streets are veU narrow, and the distance that we had to traverse, to reach ,ithin 400 yards of the wall, something beyond a mlle. Had this position been occupied only by the merest handful of the enemy (and there was nothing to prevent Its being so vithout our knowledge) we could certabnly never htve forced our way through it, and had the maerest handful of the enemy only let us pass through to the extreme end or the suburbs and then attacked us and cut off our retreat I reaUy think that hardly a man of us would have escaped to tell the tale. As It turned out, just as I was on the point of throwing out the skirmishers, an aide-de-camap v ode up to tell me we were unsupported, and must make the bes . of our way back, and he only hoped we might get back safely. Most providentially the enemy seemed to be in perfect ignorance of our movements, for not a shot was fired at us till we had almost reaohed camp again, and were very nearly out of range of the round shot from the city wallr. On reaching the ca-np we learned that the project had mis*rried, owing to a misconception of orders of Brigadier Graves, in command of the second column. Loud were ihe abtses heaped on this unfortunate man, who seemed (and perhaps deservedly so) the butt of everybody's censure. Of coumse, everylrdy attributed to him the loss of such a seemingly good opportunity of taking the city. Ithink few would venture to say so now. My own (and, I think, the general) conviction is that our force, so contemptibly small as It then was, would have bcen completely lost in such an immense city, and, urless the enemy had been most com. p'-etly panic-strioken, would have had little chance of I olding any temporary advantage that we might have gained ;u' the firat rush; I could enumerate instances of the same kind without number, but It would try your patience. I think few can ponder on all that has happened and imag;ne that our work in India is done, and that Providence has r'together forsaken us. " We opened our trenches on the 7th of September, and the way in which we a:oompllshed this was one of the most wonderful parts of the siege. Our attack was divided into two-the right and left. The right vras directed against the Mores Bastion, and the left. to which I was attaohed, was directed against the portion of the waDls near the Cashmere. gate and church. If you can recollect the ground at all you will remember that opposite Ludlow Castle (where Mr. S. Frazer lPved) towards the river it was occupled by gardens. I.he distance t tween this position and the city is very Erall, within easy range of grapeshot from No. 2 Bastion, rwa:ust which the thick brushwood was ef course no protec. tion. Breaking ground so close to the walls was a bold r snccuvre, which few circumStances would justify, and c- s which we fully expecte woio?ld cost us many valuable lives. Judge, then, of our surprise to find scarcely any notice whatever taken of our procee;nga. It is the nnose remarkable, as there seemed to be no attempt at seorecy on oar part, and we osirsolves could hear the enemy's sentries r i the ramaparts. Our working party was a-t excessively hrge one, and had the enemy taken com-aon precautiors (for they could not have been i,gaorart of our presence) they mus. have inflicted very heavy lasses, if, indeed, they had not entirely stopped our works. Vigilant, however, as we Lave ala. ys found them, this first night God seemed to have bliuded their eyes to all sense of danger; 'or, with the exception of one shower of grape and two or thrco round shot directed at us, which injured no one, they fired away at our batteries on the ridge as usual. In the moraing they acted very differently, for they commenced, and through the day kept up, a very hot fire; too late, however, wor we had managed to obtain pretty good shelter by that time, and our first battry on the right was not only finished, but armed and had at work breaehing. You would think that after the experience of our first night they woxuld havo allowed us little peace in breaking fresh ground rearer the walls; however, even then therewas not very much fire, and it was only on the third night that they seemed to awake to a sense of their danger; and from that time they 1-ept up a pretty steady fire of all sortr, including mus. ketry, asd we c'rtainly lost some men. You may fancy that the engineers had little time to themselves. I was not in bed. for four nights, and, as you may imagine, pretty well done up. There was only one battery (only 150 or 200 yards from the walls) to be finished, and it wasthe excitement alone that kept us awake. I had a party of Her Majesty's 61st and Sth Regiments under mc, filing sandbags. Tae fire was very hot, and I was ansxious to get my men uander cover in some pits, where the earth was softer to dig. I was leading tham to the pit, when, the night belng dark, I fell into one that I had not seen, and sprained my leg and ankle so severely th3t I was obliged to be taken to camp ln a dhoolle. There I hey on my back till the day of the assault. I don't thlik that anybody in camp knew for certain the time of the assault till within two hours of the time. I was in my tent, away from the mess, and therefore a no opportanity of hearing anything about it till the rattle of musketry told we tl ^t something was doirg. Of conrse, stopping in bed was out of the queetion, and as my charger was hors de com. bat, I had no choice but to mount lay little pony Donald. I bad my doubts about rmy new charger, a very pretty little beast, and peafect in every respect except courage, being one of the most determined shyers that I have ever seen. However, I had no choice for it, so I mounted, and In due course of time I found myself at the Cashmere-gate. Our columns had entered, and one had even penetrated as far as the Bank, but being unable to withatand the murderous fire, was compelled to retreat. It was with the greateAt dmlilulty that I could keep my seat, for on reaching the branch roads outside the Cashmere-gate the bullets and ahot of all descriptions were flying about liko hail, and one which struok close to the hoofs of my pony frightened im so that Le be. came quite unmanageable. HoweFer, I got him through the gate, and A foeful Bight it was thatnsmet my eye " A portion of our troops had escalded the bation walls close to the gate; others had crambled up two large breohes in the walls and bastion near the Treasury. The remainder had entered at the gate itslf, which had been blown open by one of our officers The latter was really the hazardous duty of the day, and was most gallantly performed, though In broad daylight. The explosion party consisted of Lieu. tenants lome and Salkeld, of our corps, a few sappers and a bugler of Her Majesty's 62d. On their nearing the gate they found it slightly open, with a number of musketa protruding at the opening. They were reeived with a voUey, which killed and wounded a number. Still, however, they advanced, and fixed theirpowder bags on to the gate. Se geant Carmichael, of ths Sappers, tried to light the port. fire attachcd to the bags, but was shot dead in the attempt. After him Sergeant Burness, of the Sappers, tried, but fell, pierced with three bullets. After SergeantBurness, Salkeld tried, but fell into the ditch, shot in the leg, which IN broken, andin the arm,which has been amputated. Sergeant Smith, of the Sappers, tried next, and he and Home be. twcen them happlly succeeded without a wound. Seeing the portflre well a-light the whole party jumped into the ditch, and the enemy, little dreaming of what had been done, continued firing till the explesion took pLc, so you may fancy what effect it took. 20 of the mutineers strewed tbe ZoAd inside the gate, not one of whom would it have been possible to recognize, and this was the first sight that met mny eyes at the gate. Little wonder that Donald refused to move; however, finally he did, and got as far as the centra of the main guard, beyond -which nothing would urge him. It was perfect agony keeping my seat, and I would have given worlds to dismount-but walldng was out of the question; it was anything but an agreeable fix to be in. I felt how perfectly useless I was, and being the only mounted man there in the open space, fully accounted for the number of bullets whistling past my ears There was no help for it, so I had to ncake my way back to camp as I best could, fully convinced of my own folly. You may imagine I had done neither leg nor ankle muchgood by the trip, and I had not many opportunities of seeing the remainder of the operations. We progressed slowly after this for two days, but having obtained possession of the magaaine con. taining about 130 guns there could no longer ha much doubt as to the result. The enemy, who had hitherto so stoutly resisted us, was losing heart, though he bad sue. oeeded in beating us back with loss and kept us at bay at two or three points. Daily and nightly large numbers continued to leave the city till the 20th, when we found ourselves in perfect possessdon, and the entire city evacuated. Immediately onreeeiving news of the evacuation I started for the palace. You can have no con. ception of the scene of confusion-Riflemen, Goorkhas, Sikbs, and Punjabees quarreling over their plunder, and s.ch plunder to quarrel about! Old counterpanes, dirty blankets, tin and copper pots and pans, Sepoys' red coats, I ^'kets, papers, packets of tinsel, bottles of rose water and otto of roses lying here, there, and everywhere, and the whole place in a state of squalor and wretchedness passing all description. On turning into the gardens in front of Douglas's stables I found myself alone. I cannot toll you what a scene of desolation presented itself to rny eyes, The gatden had been at encamping ground of the Sepoys, and everything bore witness to its having been deserted in hot haste. The tents were still standing, but it seemed as if everybody had taken his armful out of the boxes and, without carlng for what might drop, had made the best of his way out of the place. The stilluness, too, after the noise end riot that I had just quitted, was realy appalling, and I stood at the foot of the stairs stupefied as if with a heated atmosphere and unable to move. I ws roused by hearing three cheers from the apartments above me. . , . We have captured the King, his two sons and grandson-the threelast(among whomwas Mirza MogulBey) were most deservedly shot before they were brought into the city, where their bodies were exposed In the Chandney Chouk."
TO THE BDITOR OF THE TIES. Sir,-I send you a copy of an extract of a report, dated a September 17, from Lolonel Baird Smith to Major. Ceneral Wilson, which hae not yet, I believe, appeared In any of the papers, and its publication will be not only most gratifying to the parents and friends of the gallant men mentVoned therein, but will bring to the notice of the publio the reel faots of that desperate duty of blowing up the Cashmere-gate. You have alre.dy prominently mnentfoned Lieutenant Szikeld's name, and I am sure Lieutenant Home's gallant and cool condact o. that memorable event equally deserves the encomiums of hie countrymen; indeed, all of that yarty proved and showed themselves noble and gallant fellows. But Lieutenant Home's name appears evidently t have been inadvertently omitted in the Brigadier's report; bowever, Colonel Baird Smith on questioning one of the survivors learnt that Lieutenant Home was of the party, whereupon Colonel B. Smith ordered LIeutenant Home to make a report on the subject, when, of course, the whole came out; and the following is a copy of the 13th paragraph of the Chief Engineer's report, which will speak for itself how ably and effioiently that duty was performed by Lieutenants Home and Salkeld's party on the 14th of September last:- "Par. 13. The gallantry with which the explosion party, under Lieutenants Home and Sa1keld, performed the desperate duty of blowing up the Cashmere-gate, in broad dayIight, will, I feel sure, be held to jusbify me in maKing special mention of it. The party was composed, in addition to the two officers named, of the following Sergeants John Smith and A. B. Carmichael, and Cor. poral Bargess, Sappers and Miners ; Bugler Hawthorne, Her hjajesty's 52d, 14 native sappers and miners, 10 Punjab ditto, musters covered by the fire of Her Majesty's 60th Rifles. The party advanced at the double tovards the Cashmere-gate. Lieutenant Home, with Sergeants Smith and Carmichael, and Havildar Mahor, all the sappers leading and carrying the powder bags, followed by Lieutenant SaIlkeld, CorporalBurgess, and a portion of the remainder of the party. The advanced part. reached t'ie gateway unhur.t, and found that p;rt of the drawbridge had beeni de stroyed; but passing across the precarious footway supplied by the remaining beams, they proceeded to lodge their powder bags against the gate. The wicket was open, and through it the enemy kept up a heavy fire upon them. Ser. geant Carmichael was killed while laying his powder bag, Havildar Mahor being at the same time wounded. The powder being laid, the advanced party slipped down into the ditch to allow the firing party, under Lieutenant Salkeld, to pemorm its duty. While endeavouring to fire the charge Lieutenant Salkeld was shot through the arm and leg, and handed over the slow match to Corporal Burgese, who fell mortally wounded just as he had | successfully accomplished the onerous duty. Havildar Tilluh Sing, of the Sikhs, was wounded, and BRmloll Sepoy of tho eSme corps, was kiled during this part of the operation. The demolitlon being most successful, L{eute. neut Home, happily not wounded, caused the bhg!kr to tound the regime 2tal cr11 of the 52d, as the signal for the avrno!ng columns. Fearing that amid the noise of the assault the sounds mlght not be heard, he had the call repea'ed three times, when the troops advanced and carried the gatewav with complete success. I feel certain that a simple st-tement of this devoted and glorious deed will suffice to stamp it as one of the noblest on record in military history. The perfect suces- contributed most materially to the brilliant result of the day, and Lieutenants Home and 8s9keld, with their gallant subordinate Enropeans and natives, will, I doubt not, receive the rewards which valour before the enemy so distinguished as theirs has entitled them to.' Trusting the above will be worthy of insertion in your valuable and widely circulated paper, I remain, Yours obedientlv. INSAF.

" 2. For having, on or about the 24 of June, 1856, behived himself with disrespect towards his commanding offlcer by going into his cabin with a frivolous grievance, and attempting to enter into altercation with and to criticize the conduct of his commanding officer in a manner unbe. coming a junior officer, with referenee to a painted hand. kerchief, and to his own duties as senior lieutenant of the ship.

The Amateur Musical Soclety being now at the commencement of its twelfth season is beholden to render some account of itself. It makes no secret of Its doings, ra'ther courts than avoids attention, and is therefore just as open to criticism as any of those societies which appeal bon6 fide to the public for encouragement. As a matter of course it should be accepted for what it pretends to be-viz., a society of amateurs, and must not be blamci because it has hitherto failed to reach that degree of perfe - tion for falling moro or less short of which even professional institutionsare exposed to animadversion. StUl-the point conceded that the society owed its existence to a real love of music, and that its origin proceeded from a genuine desire to render art some service-it is not unreasonable to expe- that each successive year should bring with it some unrmstalkeable evidence of progress. Now, this ihas no' always been the case; and, though since the aceession of the present conductor, mr. Heny Leslie (who-without making invidious comparisons-has been ah'e and ready to give more time and experience to his task than any of the professional gentlemen who preceded him) a more rigid enforeement of disclpline has produced decidedly benefielal results, there is yet ves much to desire. The execution of Beethoven's first and easiest symphony last night was by no means so effident as we had aright to anticipate. Absolute refinement was hardly.to be locked for * but something more nearly approaching steadiness and unanimity might fairly have seen asked from performers who have been rehearsing and playing together upwards of 11 years. Some effeetive points were noticeable in the symphonymore especiaUy in the first movement and the minuet ; bat, besides the drawvbacks we have intimated, there was scareely the shadow of a "piano" from end to end. Mr. Leslie's overture, The Tempai-, was quite another affair. On this clever composition the amateurs expended all their energy and the result was in several Instances most gratifAN. Had Beethoven composed the overture, and Mr. e the symphony, the case would probably have been reversed; but this is only a proof of the esteem entertained by the members of the orchestra for their conductor, who by his unremitting exertions has well earned the distinction. Auber's piquant and delicately instrumented prelude to the opera of Zanetft was also, in most reycsots, more lucky than the symphony; but here t e wind instruments have a good deal to do, and the majority of the wind instruments are either in the hands of rofessors or amateurs of more than ordinary ability. The fne march from Mendelssohns AtUric vwas another example of what the amateur musicians can effect when they ae in arnest. With the merits of Mr. Waley's pianoforte-concerto our readers are already acquainted; and we have only to add that another hearing confirmed the good impression It I created when first introduced at the concerts of the society by the composer himself. Madamo Roche played it admirably; and if Mr. Waley was not satisfied he must be difiicult to please where his owrn music is concerned. That Madame Rocbe should excel als apianist will surprise no one when it is stated that ahe is a daughter of Mr. Moseheles, rhose departure from England to fill the pos' in the Lelpdc Conservatory, left vacant by thc death of Mendelssohn, deprived our metropousofne of the mostadistinguishedmusical celebrities that ever made it a residdenoe. Madame Roch, on retiring from the orchestra, was loudly and descrvedly applauded. In the concerto the amateurs again entitled themelves to 'praiSe for the careful manner in which they performed the orchestral accomnpanfiments. The vocal music was successful. " Vol che sapete" should never be sung by a contralto, since it was 'written for a soprano, and transposition spoils it; but the voice and singing of Eiss L,effier (daughter of the late wrell-known bass) swere both so agreeable as to disarm objection. Miss L uci Fo3broke would have done herself and Haydn's canzonet more justice had she consigned the task of accompanyist to another. Mendelssohn's plaintive two-part Bong, in which the ladies both sang their best, produced a marked effcot, and, had the singers been 'wiling, it would have been heard again with pleasure. Mr. Henry Leslie was heartily greeted eci t 1g his plaQ PA th condutoeas desk.
IRHELAZND. (1OM UOUR OWN ODSRRO2wDrT.) DUBLIN, MO3NDAY MoRoG. THE RXOENT MONLE PAICO. Saturday's reports from the north are for the most part as satisfactory as could be expected. The panic, which had spread more or less over Ulster, has completely subsided, the run on the banks has ceased; the farmers who had withdrawn their deposits have generally relodged them, and in those places where the notes were received with a grudge they are now freely tken, At a large fair last week in Meath the notes oi the Belfast banks, according to the Banner, were accepted ia preference to those of the Bank of Ireland I The following is an extract from the Trade Report of the Belfast Mercury:- "Affairs are fast beginning to ausmue a more hopeful aspect, and perhaps one of the most conclusive proofs that could be afforded of the 4onfidence felt by our merchants and mannfacturers in the stability of our commerce and the im. proprlety of showing anything that might be construed into distrus is that the adjourned meeting of flax-spinners held t4o-ay,-at which it was expected that a resolution would become to for diminishing production in the several mills -sepated without coming to a determination on the subject. The criis Is producingwide-spread effects in England; the suspensions this week have been more numerous and to a larger amount tban in any week since the commencemnent of the embarrassments ; but many of these were houses which, sooner or later, must have gone down, and whose cessation cannot, on the whole, be considered a serious to the commerce of the country. Compared with the suspensions in England and Scotland, Ireland stands c-t in favourable relief; and the fact that so very few o' the commercial and manufacturing firms of this country have felt it necessary to seek the indulgence of their creditors Is gratifying evidence that their transactions are carried on In a proper mercantile spirit, and that they do not, as a body, commit the great mistake of confounding overtrading and apeculation with enterprise and energy. Bmployment In Belfast, -we are happy to say, is pretty general, all things considered; and the reduced prices of food prevent those who are engaged from experiencing any distress. We must mnake some exceptions with respect to the sewed muslin trade, about 2,000 young wromen, who were formerly earn. ing from 5s. to 7s. and 8s. a-week, having been thrown idle by the suspension of the letd:ng houses in that trade in Scotland and the contractcd operations of the majority of the local houses. Bat the greater number of those young -women have fathers and brothers who arc employed at other avocations, so that they are In a position far removed from distress." There is, however, a reverse side to this picture. Prices of aoricultural stock have within the last month suffered a serious deterioration, the fall being estimated at not less than 15 per cent. For instance,- "An extensive farmer In the neighbourhood of Belfast, who has a large stock farm in County rXeath, sold one thousand poundsv worth on Wednesday at CArlanstown Bridge fair, for which he was offered 1,15U1. tvro weels previously. This is accounted for chiefly because of the high price of money and the large quantities of cattle forced upon the arket." The Northern Whig, too, asserts as beyond any doubt that we may 'be prepared for a winter of great commercial and manufacturing depression, and, as a sequence, considerable distress among the working classes of the population. At present, however, there is no reason to complain. "We are gratified to find," adds the WhiVy, "after a ood deal of investigation among the leading trades of B ast, that business, amid the difflculties of the past month, Is In a far more satisfactory state than could have been expected. Not only our local banks and great mauufaoturing firms succeessfully resisted the crisis, but in the minor details of business life-among small shopkeepers and traders-there is a great amount of confidence In the future." One of the Dublin trade reports gives a cnmparison of the prices of the leading Irisli securities now and at the same time of last year. The difference between the value at the two periods is far less than might have been anticipated from the exciting nature of the events which have been crowrded into the last few weeks alone. Bank shares, which in many cases in England and Scotland have suffered severely5 here fully maintainc d their ground; re;Iway securities are aU lower, the non-dividend-paying stocks suffering the most. Mining sharcs are higher. In the funds there is a reduction of 3i per cent. Nov. 20, 1S56. Nov.21,1857.

MErROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. A special meeting of the Board was held yesterday at the Council-chamber, Guildhall; Mr. Thwaites in the chair. THE MAII DsRALAGE SClEME. Mlr. BRISoN presented a memorial from the Greenwich district against the adoption of any plan for the main drainage of the metropolis which would sabjesA the metropolitan ratepayers to a greater liability than was required by the statut-3. Mr. BOYSTON presented a memorial from the vestry of St. Mary, NewiDgton, Surrey, to the sauoe effect. Mr. BRISTOW renewed his motion for a conforence to be held between the Board and the members of Parliament for the metropolis and the metropolitan counties and boroughs, on the subject of the expense for extending the outfall from plan B* to Sea Reach. By the resolution pamsed last vweek the Board determined that It would not bo just to the ratepayers to exterd the outfall beyond B' at their expense. The Boord did not thereby mean to say that the outfall should not be at Sea Reach, only that the expense of carrying it to that point shouId no be borne by the metropolitan ratepayers. As the question of expense mast ultimately be deoidcd by the House of Commons, he thought nothing was more natural than that the Board should confer with those members of that House who represented the metropolitan constituencies, to ascertainwhether they were prepared to support in Parliament the views which the Board enter. famned on this subject. Maior LYoN thought the motion premature, inasmuch as the Board was rot prepared with any plan to sabmit to the members reDresenting the Metropolitan onstituencies, he therefore beggcd to move the p.evious question. ?jF-. Deputy H sRrIK seconded the amendment. Tbe question being put, the presious auestiouL was carried by a majurity of eight-'9 being for, and 11 agairst. htr. WRIHT, after n fov preliminary remark; moved the following resolution:- That ibis Bosar Is ot oplnion that It Is deslrable to arranep, fist, the point oZ outfa l; secondly, the afre to bo drained: and thirdly, the quatity of etorm-water to be psovided for l's the sewes" Should the Board come to a resolution upon these points, it might be necessary for their chaii nan to have another interv;ew with the First CommDissioner. He thought this course would be much oetter than the Board getting into a controverey with Captain Galton and Mr. Simpson. The Board could not debate the question with those gentlemon; it was with Sir B. Hall alone that the Board had to deal. The Board should make Sir B. Hall state distinctly what were his viewvs, and not allow him to evade the responsibility whish properly attacbed to him by throwing it on the shoulders of the engineers. The motion, not being seconded, necessarily dropped Mr. LESLrE then rose to bring before the Board the general question of the drainage of the metropolis, partioularly in re.erence to the plan proposed by Captain Galton, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Blackwell, and he expressed a hope that in the result he should be ablo to induce the Board to reject the plan of those gentlemen. If so, plan B* having already been rejected by the First Comrissioner, the Board would really ha.te to commaence the work of the main drainage of the metropolis. The finst thing to be considered was the total volume of sewage estimated by the reerees to be discharged in 24 hours In dry weather. They stated that on the north side of the Thames there would be 11,513,227 cubic set to be discharged in that space of time, and on the soush vtde 3,736,550 cubic feet, making together 15,249,777 cubic feet on the present metropolitan area. The details of these figures were given in the refereese raport. They take crodit for the whole of the water supplled by tne water companies on both sides of the river baing passed into the sewers, amounting to 80 per cent. of the whole sewage discharge in dry weather. The referees' reservoirs for draining the Thames was an vrea of 20 acres of 5 feet deep. The CnLuRxsA.-Where do yoa find that t Mi. LFssre.-I is in the first report. Mx. CARPiAL.-I assure you it is no'. There is a noZ s in the second report of the referees, stating that that would be the avaUable depth at neap tides, but at spring tides the available depth of reservoir would be 10 feet, which would double the scouring power at such tines. Mr. LESLIE said he had taken the depth At 5 feet, and these resezvoirs would hold 4,338,000 cubbi feet, consequently all the referees' present quantitiesof sewage for the 24 hours in dry weather would be contained in saoh a reservoir of 70 acres in extent. The referees propoeed first to provide for a prospectlve increase of the area of the metropolis, for winch the present ratepayers were to be taxed, that increase being from an area of 75,251 acres to 226,784 acres. They also estimated for a prospective increase of the populxtion from 2,600,000 to within a fraction of 4,000,000. The quantity o sewage only in dry weather upon their extended area and extended population, 50 years hence, would take a reservoir of 128 acres, and the amount of rain-fall for dilution would bring the quantity up to an additional 844 acres, nahdng together 972 acres, The referees estimated the in ereas Lwrater supply to each individual at seven cubio feet per day, whUe others were content to consider five cubic feetsuficient. Then as to the rate at rhich this swage would pass out-the referes estimated that 49 per cent. would be discharged from 9 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon that would be at the rate of 15,567 cubic feet per 1iitutq; iDut when It Camv tol bQv the Atgr dilUQto It would be at the rate of 215,307 cublc feet per minute, So that, although the whole of the present discharge wa only 15,567 eubio feet per minute, yet the rderee. Would tax the ratepayers of the metropolis for conveying &may sewage at the rate of 215,307 cubic feet per: minute. Then, writh respect to the outfalls, having ascertained what was the quantity of sewage to be disposed of, the next question was in what manner it was to be got away. The referees proposed two outflls, one 39 feet wide jnd 16 feet deep, on the north xide from Barling to Mucking lighthiouIe-19 mikes; and the other37feet wide and 16 feet deep on the south ide, from Woolwich to Higham Creek-_i milk The sewage put in on the north aide at Barking would be 11 hours getting to Sa Beach, the Telocity belng 2i feet per seoond, equal to 1-7 mile per hour. The sewAge put in on the soath side would be 1 hoeri running before it got to the outfalL Thls *as a point deserving of consideration, He did not know whether it would be called an enineerlng po;nt; for his part, he thought nothbin more than oommon sense was required to dig a ditch of 1tI miles long and 16 feet deep. But the spring tides aud high water at Gravesend would make it necessry to have gates at the end of the channels, else the tide must flowU the channels, in either case, great obstruction to the fal of the sewage mus take place. If the Board were to agree to either alternative, in his opinion the countty would be deluged with filth, or with se water. Tho referees proposed to add to the present mDetropolitan area on the north side, which oonsisted of 31,556 acres, no less than 96,216 acres, the greater portion of which they called the Valey of the Lea. In 50 years the referee assumed that the population of that valley would increae from 59,000 to 100,000, which, at seven aublo feet for each person, would make 700,000 cubia feet of sewage for that additional district in every 24 hours. This would requlre an additional dilution of 5,600,OOO cubic feet of rainfall, making the sewage and dilution together 6,300,000 cubic feet-in other words, the scheme of the referees was that the Metropoiitan Board should call upon the ratepayers of the metropolis to payfor channels, commencing at Hoddeadon in Hertiordahire, for conveying sewage from every individual living at the census of 185. 106 cubic feet in everv 24 hours, aud for every individual, at the assumed popuilation by the referees 50 years henoe, 63 cubic feet. On the north the sewage of parts of HIan. well, Chiawiok, Acton, part of Rensington, Brompton, Hamer8mith, Bulham, three divisions of Chelsea, Belgrave, Bt. Margarets and St. John's, two-thirds of Charing-cross, ad ore-sixth of St. Jame'es-square was to be taken to a point 3,800 feet above Battersea-bridge, 2,000 feet above the month of theKRensmgton canal, aud there passeduundertheThanesto Battersea and then raised by artifical means into a southern high-level sewer; and then It was to be carried 19 mrnle further down, and put into the water at Sea Reach. (Hear.) The propositions of the referees were not in accordance with the principles which they themselves propounded. Instead of removing the sewage with rapidity they interposed every obstacle to its being quiccly passed away. Among other methods they recommended a system of flushing, but no practical engineer would say that a sound system of drainage required fiushing; every sewer ought to be enabled to ciesnso itself. It was also proposed that every one of the sewers should have storm overflows to go to the bottom of the river Thames. That of itself opened the wholo question which the Board would, sooner or later, have to enter upon-namely, the separation of the sewage from the rain-water. the hon. member concladed by moving that the Board reject the plan sent to them by the First Commissioner for the main drainage of the metropolis by Captain Douglas Galton, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Blackwell. Mr. SAVAGE seconded the motion. Mr. BRISTOW moved the previous question, which was carried by a majority of 11-19 being for and 8 against it Mr. CA RtP1tXL said in much that his friend M-. Leslie had advanced he entirely concurred,but he was sot prepared to support hls friend'j motion, because it would place the Board in an Inconvenient position. It was quite clear that up to th?s moment the Board had no engineering plan before them upon which they could go to the First Comnissloner. They bad tried their hards to satisfy the First Commissioner, and the First Commisoner, through his engineers,had triedhis hand,butthey had both faUed. The hon. Igentleman then prooceded to compare the two report which hadheen furnished by the Government ro erees,and said that the second report from those gentlemen was ans entire departure from the propoitions contained in their frst roport. and that the last echeme propounded by them was as wild as the preceding one and if there had not been a prec-ding scheme he should have said that It was the wildest he had ever seen during the thirty years' experience in which either directly or indir tly he bad been consulted upon every great dra5uage question tbat had occurred in this country. In this state of things, wbat ought the Bosrd to do? His advice was, that they should call in the best talent of the country, and obtaiu from them a report upon everything that had gone before, and then let the Board determine as men of business, not as engineers, whether the now scheme, the old scheme, or any other scheme the engineers might recommend was that which the Board ought to adopt. The hoe. member concluded by moving- That the repozt of tho Board sabmitted to tIe hIst Cosumls stoner, and aso the i-epets ot the referees, be referred to the enaRnee of tbe Bed, together with two otter cvil engrecra, ard tbat they be nstructedato repent rte the Boardto the best eans of carring oet the malu dralnage ottShe n etsopol4, and tha nla report oin the expense or the wcrka propoed theJwll state, Sat, the er onut neres-,ry for cerring the sewage to B', o In case the feOs ea' dbe provided, theuther cost Xn carrying the ewage to the point ot outfau at 8ea Mr. SNow seconded the motion. Air. DOULToN opposed the motion. He considered the srcond report from the referees as the result of the conferenoe, and he entertained no eoubt that the engineer of the Board was perfectly capable of answering that second report. Bat if the motion of Mr. Carpmael Ehould be adopted it would lead to an interminable series of reports, one answering the other. If it were the wish of hon, members to delay the great question of the drainage of the metropolIs they conld noS do better than adopt the motion of Mr CarpmaeL The; wore no ongineering dificulties that made it necessry fer the Board to refer the reports to any other engineers After a few words from Major LYONS, Mr. D'IFASGER, and Mr. InscLAV.- Mr. CRELI.S moved as an amendment,- "Tht the report- snt to the board b7 the Chief Oem un'loner bhe refered to the eusinee of the Board to examine and repor. hereon., The amendment not being seconded fell to the ground. After some further discudson, in the course of which Mr. Deputy HARRISON said that, although the adoptioa of the motion would be a beginning de noro, and although he deeply regretted the loss of time, the loss of money, and, it might be the loss of character of that Board which had occurred, still, as every plan that had been proposed had been rejected, they must begin de no. The adoption of tbe motion might cause a little delay, but what was the con. sequence of delay compared with the obtaining of a plani which the public approved? Let the Board arrive at a plan that met with the ap.probation of the public, and they might depend upon it that no objc^tion would be ra3ised against the expense for carryingit into exeocution. He thought it important to refer the reports to three emirent engineers in order, among other thmngs, that they might qualify themselves to appear as witnesses before a committee of the House of Commons, for the Board would be obliged to go to Parliament, as they did not at present possess sulicient poowers to raise the money necessary to c3y out the work. M;r. WuL1;isox moved as an ameudment,- "That Mr. Bnzalgette he lestruesed to consult two esgineers upon the polnts of difference betweco the plans of the Government referees and of the eungleer of the Bc3d." Mr. BRISTOw seconded the amendment. 3L-. H. L. TAYLOR thought it of no use for gentlemen to entertain tho idea that B* would be accepted by the First Commissioner. It had been already rejected by him. Mr. Rusrell, the assittant secrctary, in his letter to the Board said, "I have also been directed to informa you that tho First Commissoner did not approve of plan B with a star." Susrely tha~was distinct enough. Trheonly ractical course the Board could pursue wan to associate with their owen engineer two gentlemen who should present to the Board a plan to which. having his concurrence, we ought to feel our. selves bound to pay the greatest attention. After some further discussbontho amendment was put and negatived. The criginal motion was then put and carried, on a division, by a majority of 9, there being 17 for and S against it. Mr. CARPIVAEL then moved that Mr. Thomas Hawkesley and Mr. George Bidder be the referees. Mr. MORLAND seco ided the motion. Mr. BRlusaow thought notice ought to be given of the names proposed. Mr. LEsLiE said, there was no necessity for such a course, the names of the two gentlemen having been long sinco mentioned as those to wbom the reference would be made. Mr. CARPMAEL said, he had looked throagh the list of men who were celebrated in the class of wouks to which the one under their consideration belonged, and he found that Mr. Bidder had a larger quantity of business, foreign rid domestic, of that description than any other engineer, and Mr. Hawkesley, it was known, hadaliways been at the top of et a tree u hydraulic cigineering. The mo,ion was then agreed to. COMrUNrCATION FROM THE FIRST CO0firrSSrOxR. The CIAisctsA.i~, in the course of the day, informed the Board that a communication had been recelved from the First Commissioner, signed by Mr. Austin, in wlich that gentleman stated that ae had in pursnuance of instrmctions forwarded to the Board certin plans and sections as required by the Board. The letter having been read by the clerk, The CHAIRMiAN asked Mr. Bazalgotte, the engineer of the Board, whother the First Commissioner had furnished all the information required ? Mr. BAZALGLTrE.-The sections. and explanations now Eent do not contain all the information asked by the Board; nor is it sufficient to enable an enginoer to check their proposals, or to test their estimates oftheir works. Theb have sent no longitudinal secbion of the sewer on the south side of the river, and the one on the north side doss not show the eis;tiug rlvers and streams which p ass at right anglea through the centre of thcir proposed sewers, m 10 or 12 plac. These present engineer difficulties, and the proposed modes of overcoming those difflculties are not shown. The cross sections now sent do no; show the substance and materials of which theypropose to construct thesm sewers, nor do the estimates OIve the quantities of such. materials, or the prices at which they are valucd; they merely give a lump sam per mile as their valuO. Wo requireinformation frOm the referees wlr respect to their plen, similar to that whioh we have forwarded to them with raspect to our plan; and without this, it Is impossible for any engineer to report upon, or judgo of the correctness of the statements contained In their report. On the motion of Lieutenant-Colonel KXliMY It WM agreed that the First Commissioner be informed that the sections and information nowsent do not show the subrtance and materials of the proposd sewers, or the mode of tasslnR livers or btrea ns which cross at right angles through their conrse of the sews i nor do the estimates give the quantities of materis .of which they would be constrrcted, or the prices attached thereto, but merely a lump sum per mile, and that no ac. efon on the south side of the river ha been furnished end that he be requested to obtain from the Baxd the dctrtis respecting the referees' plan, srilar to those Neut to them by this Board with respeot to Its plan, I Mjoum,ed,
FORRIGN INTBLLGENCE. FRANOE - rpforbionof the following appeared in our eecond edi. .A.-. ,d (FROM OUR OWN CORRZSI'ONDMNT.) Tr&k ', OiuiDAY, Nov. 22, 6 P.M. The Divan of Wallachia unanimously adopted oa the 19th the memorandum explanatory of the four resolutions of the Rouman people as agreed to on the 21st October last. The popular assemblies of those provinces seem to take as their model the French Constituent Assembly of 1789. This body, on the ITth of June, effaced the distinction between the three orders of the nation, and the States-General became a National Asembly; the '3d of June was the termof the moral, and the 14th of July of the material, power of French Royalty; and the 4th of August was the complement of the first Revolution. hioldavia has just had its 4th of August. In the sitting of the 9th, 10th, and 11th inst. the Divan ad hoc, on the question of the reforms to be introduced into the Principality, adopted unanimously, and as the basis of the new order of things, liberty in matters of religion, equality before the law, general partition of imposts, capacity of all citizens to fiSl offices of the State, separation of administrative from judicial functions, abolition of the privileges which constituted the ancient laws of the country, and, in a word, the application to Moldo-Wallachia of what are termed in France the principles of 1789. A few remarks on this point may not be out of place. They are intended to present some precise notions of the internal condition of Moldo-Wallachia to the present date, and to throw a little additional light on one important question on which a strong difference of opinion exists,-namely, whether the Danublan Provinces contain, or not, the elements of a free people. And, first of all, a few words on the history of the facts themselves. After the voting of the " four points" of the political programme, that is to say, union, self-government (autonomy), the sovereignty of aforeign Prince, and Constitutional government, one great difficulty presented itself,what, after all, was the duty of the Divans? Considering their mission as terminated, should they have adjourned until such time as the Paris Congress had pronounced its decision on these four points? On the one hand common sense, on the other respect for the rights of the country, seemed to counsel such a line of conduct. Independently of the consideration that it wa3 not regular to proceed to the discussion of organic laws before the Constitution was adopted, the question of union or continued separation necessarily taking precedence of all others, it should not be forgotten that the Divans have, according to the Treaty of Paris, a consulting mission only. They consequently were bound, if they wished to maintain intact the rights of the country as ratified by that instrument, to limit themselves strictly to the discussion of the political question, -which, being part of the public law of Europe, is within the attributes of the great Powers, without touching the domestic question, which belongs entirely to the governing authority, and is not subject to the control or intervention of those Powers. The acts of the Divans justify the observation of a high authority on such matters, namely, that the General Assemblies of MoldoWallachia have not simplv expreseed their wants and wishes, but have enacted decrees. The European Commissioners, however, havlng urged the Divans to protract, irrespectively of the " four points," their deliberations on the divers topics relating to the reorganization of the provinces, the Divan of Moldavia, out of deference to the Powers, framed a list of demands, comprised in 12 articles, to be appended to the " four points," but accompanied with the express declarations,-]st, that these demands, submitted voluntarily and spontaneously to the Congress by the Divans, should not be in any wise prejudicial to the autonomy or self-government of the Principality; 2d, that, in case the bases proposed by the Wallachian Divan were not identical, such eventual difference should not be used as an argument against the political union of the Principalities, which had been demanded by the unanimous vote of the representatives of both. Among the 12 articles alluded to there are several -such, for instance, as the organization of the army -with a view to neutrality and to the combined defence of the territory of the Principalities (Art. 4); respect for the domiciles and personal liberty of the citizens (Art. 8); separation of the executive and legislative powers (Art. lO) ; and responsibility of Ministers ( trt. 12)-which need no commentary, for they explain themselves. There are others, however, which, to be understood, require some explanation ; and, as these explanations relate to the religious, political, and social organization of the Rouman country, they may be given here. The provisions relating to religion are comprised in the 5th and 6th Articles, which are worded thus:-Liberty of worship within the conditions of the stipulations with the Ottoman Porte. Establishment of a Synodal authority concentrating In itself the direction of the spiritual affairs of the Rouman Church. All forms of worship to be freely professed in Moldo-Wallachia-all, with the exception of the religion of their masters, orthe pretended masters, of the country-the Turks ! It is, in fact, declared in the 10th Article of the stipulations of 1460 that " no Mussulman mosque shall ever be erected in any part of the Wallachian territory." .Now, if this formal stipulation be compared with the religious and political code of Islamism, in virtue of which the erection of the mosque on the Dar-ul-harb (the territory of the infidel, in contradistinction to the Dar-ul-Islam, the territory of Islamism) is regarded as the sign of conquest, how. can the Turks pretend that they are the Sovereigns of the country ? That Sovereignty iq, indeed, e.xtraordinary which refuses you the right to pray, to reside, or even to traverse freely yourow.n States! The declaration of the Moldavian Divan does more than merely record a pre-existing fact. By the establishmuent of a Synodal authority centralizing the spiritual affairs of the IRouman Churoh it tends to place it in a condition of complete independence with regard to the great Church of Constantinople, as has already been the case with the Servian and Hellenic Churches. That independence, which has not occasioned a schism in Greek orthodoxy, is derived from its very constitution. Intruth,the various churches of the Orthodox communion, governed by their respective Synods, are independent of and equal to each other ; each preserves its tongue, its liturgy, and its discipline ; this dogma having been immutably fixed since the 4th Council of Constantinople in 869. The Eastern Church has been administered after this manner to the present day in Turkey, in independent Greece, in the Ionian Islands, in Russia, and in Austria, where the Orthodox Servians have an independent Patriarchate, of which the seat is Carlowitz. The unity of the Orthbolox communion is maintained by the fraternal concord of these various Synods, and by their unvarying deference towards the patriarchal Church of Constantinople, the eldest sister of all, and the first in rank. This fundamental principle of Orthodoxy, which assimilates it in some measure to Protestantism, is one of the causes to which may be attributed the little progress of Rome in the East. The Roman Church tends to absorb nationalities, whereas the other not only contributes to their conservation, but even to their development. In Turkey the Catholic Armenians are hardly, if at all, regarded as Armenians. 1 Up to the present time the Rouman Church, tnougul mtndependent of Constantinople, for the Metropolitans of Bucharest and Jassy, as well as their Suliragans, are named directly by the ordinary Assemblies of the two Provinces, without the intervention of the Patriarch, to whom they merely pay a sum of 3,000 di:cats on their being enthroned, has not been considered as formin" a distinct Church, inasmuch as the Principalities themselves, being reckoned among the provinces of the Ottoman Empire, did not form a distinct State. If the union of the Principalities take place in conformity with the basis of the " four points3" it is evident that the complete emanCipation of the Church will follow that of the State. One is the necessary consequence of the other. While on this point I may notice what has often been said respecting the identity of religious doctrine, giving to the Russians a power in the Principalities against which no other influence has a chance of ever prevailina That statement is exaggerated. The Moldo-Wa'iachians, far from looldng upon the Bussians as their co-religionists, consider them as schismatics. They refue to frequent their places of worship; and, though there is a chapel in Paris for the use of the Russian Embawy and of Russian subjects the Roumans who reside in this capital Lave built a ehapel where they practise their own rite, and where the Archimandrite, the Rev. Josaphat Inagovearo, has regularly officiated since its foundation. The grounds on which the Roumans found their dissent from the Muscovite Church were clearly explained by the Archimandrite in an address delivered on the opening of the church in 1854. With this hasty sketch I leave the Danubian Provinces for the present, and turn to another country, where free istitutions are, after years of trial, still struggling to maintain their ground. From the Danube to the Ebro the distance is not so great as people raay suppose. If the English and French Governments differ about MoldoWallachia, they perfectly agree on all the affairs of Spain, present and contingent. Lord Howden is about to return to Madrid. His Lordship has been detained here some time by the Mexican question, which still presents some difficulty, and even danger, if left unsettled. It is understood that Lord Howden is charged to show the Spanish Government the exnediency of receiving M. Lafragua (the Mexican Envoy), and thus alloswing the mediation of England and France to proceed without delay, as, beyond all doubt, there is a numerOUs party on the borders of the Inited States and Mexico only waiting for an opportunity to envenom the quarrel, in order to turn it to their own advantage. While the Britieh Minister at the Court of Madrid has instructions to this effect, the French Minister in Mexico will receive others to endeavour to persuade that Government to withdraw its pretension of having M. Lafragua received at Madrid as an indispensable preliminary. It is hoped that this double action of Lord Howden at Madrid, and M. de Gabriac in Mexico, will prevent an explosion which will most certainly inflict much damage on all concerned, if the Governments of Spain and Mexico continue in their present obstinacy, and allow so much danger to both to follow ..rom a question of vanity and a point of etiquette. A private letter from Madrid, of the 17th, states as follows:- " The financial crisis, which is so general in other countries, Is beginning to be felt among us. The funds are low, and the fall in the Three per Cents. is especially owing to the influx from abroad of a masn of paper of the Consolidated Debt, the holders wishing to tnrn it Into cash with a view to the large profits presented by the exuortation of the precious metals. It is strange that the Spans Bank has not raised its rate of interest on discount which is Ktll at 5 per cent. Findlng, however, that houses who have their representatives in Madrid discounted largely by means of deposits in Government Stock, and withdrew from the establishment an enormous quantity of specie for exportation, the Bank, instead of raising its discount, contraoted it within very narrow limits. This abrupt change has placed in a difflcult position several of the principal merchants of Madrid, who have abundance of paper but very little specle. Before the Bank Council adopted that resolution the holders of Government securities deposited them on account of advances at 5 per cent., which they negotiated afterwards and reslized a profit of 2i per oent., as Government Three per Cents, in reality pay an interest of 7i per cent. Now that the Bank will not discount, those who bought stock with the view of making their 2% per cent., exclusive of the profits on exportation, cannot re-sell their Three per Cent. paper, as the funds fel considerably in the course of two days. They consequently find themselves embarrassed, and the result is much perturbation in the market. One well-known capitalist in particular is said to have lost 4,000,000 of reals (40,000Q. )on the 200,000,000 which he holds as the proceeds Of the negotiation on the loan. He cannot discount this paper at the Bauk, neither can he dispose of it at the Bourse without considerable loss, for the simple reason that if it were sold the funds would fall lower, and an enormous quantity I of stock is offered at this moment. For the last day or two numbers of people have been to the Bank demanding cash for their notes, and yesterday crowds assembled at the doors. The Bank paid its rates yesterday in peseta pieces, and not in five-frano pieces or Spanish dollars, with the view of obstructing the exportation as much as possible. In addition to this state of affairs, it is to be observed that the usual great exportation of our excellent fruit from the provinces of the south and the east, where the crop was so abundant this year, has not taken place this autumn. No foreign ship has yet arrived in those ports, and the fruit is beginning to rot. The export of Malaga and Alicante raisins and of the figs and almonds of Murcia and Valencia, has failed in consequence of the commercial crisis throughout Europe. Spain loses by this alone 8,000,000 dollars, which were annually distributed through the country. To finish with this matter, I must tell you that yesterday hL Mon remonstrated -with the representative at Madrid of a capitalist of European celebrity on his exportation from Spain of the precious metals. 'I f our friends,' said Mi. Mon, 'treat us so, what may not our enemies do r I. Mon has always been a sincere friend of the capitalist in question, but he cannot approve operations which are so injurious to the best interests of the country, partioularly on the part of friends." The Emperor returned at 3 o'clock this afternoon from Compiegne. The infant Prince passed first along the boulevards in a close carriage with his governess, escorted by a smaU detachment of Lancers. In a few minutes afterwards the Emperor and Empress followed in an open carriage, with half a squadron of the Cent Gardes as an escort. The day was fine, though cold, and the usual groups were assembled on the Boulevards. The Emperor was respectfully saluted as he passed along. A.USTRIA. (FROM OUR OWN CORBRESPONlYET.) VIENNA, Nov. 20. The Finance Department has this morning published an ordinance, which is a supplement to the Imperial decree relative to the newspaper stamp. The document signed by His Majesty the Emperor was understood to say that only the morning editions of the public papers should pay stamp duty, but the Minister of MFinance now informs his subordinates and the public that if more copies of the evening supplement to a paper are printed than of the paper itself, all the extra copies of the supplementary sheet must be stamped. For instance, if the proprietor of a newspaper sells 3,000 copies of the morning paper and 4,000 copies of the so-called " evening sheet," all the former, and 1,000 of the latter, must be stamped. It is generally believed that this blow is aimed directly at the Presse and Wanderer, * which papers do not always express approbation of the measures of the Chief of the Finance Department. In the Imperial decree it is said that each sheet of paper must be stamped before it is printed, but that the stamp will not be charged if the paper which is not used is sent back 'within a certain number of hours. The Ministerial ordinance, on the contrary, says that no allowance will be made for paper stamped but not used. You wil doubtless agree with me in thinking that the Minister of Finance has done his work in a most masterly way, and that he merits the esteem and gratitude of those persons who are of opinion that the liberty of the press is an unbearable nuisance. Persons who exercise great influence on all matters connected with the press have been heard to declare that if the independent papers should survive the blow now dealt, " heavier ones will be inflicted on them." Persons connected with the Finance Department state that the reduction of the army will lead to a saving of 24,000,000 filorins per annum, but military men are of opinion that the expendi- ture ot the War Department wilU be about 6,O(0,000 florins less in 1858 than it was in the military year 1857, which ended on the 31st October. The artillery will only sell off 1,000 horses. It has been remarkedthat the War Department always spends far more than the sum allotted to it by the Minister of Finance, and consequently people are by no means sangine that the redtiction of the standing army will enable him to get rid of the alarming yearly deficit. It may be observed that a reduction of the army is generally talked of a couple of months before the balance sheet of the State is published. It is foreseen that the change which is to take place in the currency in 1859 will be attended with some confusion, and, to obviate this as far as possible, a commission has been appointed, which is to make all such calculations and propose all such measures as may appear necessary. The commission, which is composed of a delegate from each of the Ministerial Departments, met last week for the first time. The intrigues against Count Buol are still going on in aristocratic circles, but they are not likely to disturb the equanimity of that statesman, as he must be well aware that he possesses the full confidence of his Sovereign. The Russians see that the foreign policy of Austria has undergone no change since the interview of the two Emperors at Weimar, and they will probably soon begin to suspect the truth, which is, that Count Buol during the whole of the war with Russia merely obeyed the positive orders which he received from his Imperial master. The fact was repeatedly mentioned in my correspondence, but at the time It did not obtain as much credit as it deserved. PRUSSIA. (]MOM OUR OWN 00XLM8P02qDU.t BBRLIN, Nov. 21. The Priness of Prusdia arrived here on Wednesday evening, accompanled by the Prince, who joined her at Potsdam, on her way hither. The following day being the Queen's saint's-day or fate, the whole of the Royal family now present in Berlin proceeded to Potsdam, to present to her their coagratulations, and afterwards dined together in the Stadtschloss in that town. The Queen, after reeeiving the congratulations of the Royal family, remained at Sans Souci with the King, with whom she subsequently took a drive and dined. The visits of ceremony usually paid by the Court to the Queen on oecasion of her f8te were on this anniversary dispensed with, and the aristocracy, as well as the members of the Royal Household, simply sent in their cards to the RofrmarschaUs amt (Lord Chamberlain's-office). The only members of the Royal family absent from Potsdam on this occasion were Prince Frederick William, now in England, and his uncle, Prince Albrecht, who was detained at Roderan by the railroad being encumbered with broken carriages and goods, the result of a collision that had taken place just before. The conduct of the affairs of the Royal House-that is to say,the private affairs of the Crown and Royal family, have within the last few days come also into the Prince of Prussia's hands. Of home politics there is very little more to be mentioned. It is settled now that the Prussian Diet shall be convoked for the middle of January, the time indicated by the late alteration of the article of the Charter on this head; and it may be foreseen that, should nothing very unexpected happen, the session will be very short and very unimportant. In consequence of the present provisional arrangement for the conduct of publie affairs, no new lawa involving matters of principle will be submitted to the two Houses of the Diet, and least of all will the finaneial measures rejected during the last session be brought forward again in this. The only one of seven measures of finance that succeeded in obtaining the approbation of the representatives of Prussia was that for subjecting the revenues of joint-stock companies to a tax; a measure perfectly just in itself, but very clurasily introduced, inasmueh as all railway jointstoek companies are already taxed, and are, there. fore, to be exempted from the Bill, and all the shareholders in joint-stock companies are already muloted in the general income-tax. This bungling bit of legislation, which was passed last session, received the Royal sanction only a few days back at the hands of the Prince of Prussia. The whole result likely to be obtained by this new tax, which has had the effect of enragging the commercial and speculative classes more than ever against the landed interest, is estimated atl2,O000thalers (18,0001.) Thenext session of this Diet will also be the last, as its three years' duration vill then have expired. A general election will necessarily follow, and with the new Houses of the following Diet a fresh attempt at legislation will probably be made. Before they come together some influential events will have taken place in the history of Prussia, and still more will possibly have supervened; the state of things will no longer be the same, and the new Houses will probably be met by, a new Ministry, in whole or in part, under new and more promising auAspiceAs. The only measure that can be looked forward tz with any certainty as about to be introduced during the forthcoming session is one for IncreaEsing the pay of all subaltern officials of the Government; this class of persons is certainly the most to be pitied in Prussia, as having suffered the moat from the decrease in the value of money, which has brought their small salaries, at no time sufficient for a decent livelihood, to a mere means of starvation. The riss in the price of all the necessaries of life here during the last five years is on an average about 60 per cent., and is the result, not only of the decreased value of money, but of the restrictions on trad3 and enterprise of every sort, which keep the supply inconveniently low, while witli the increase of population and wealth the demand is becoming continually greater. At this time most of the necessaries of life are dearer here than in London, so that it is worth while to import them thence and pay all fiscal and other expenses on them, and thereis every prospect of prices becoming still dearer, owing to the restriction and repression exercised by the State and municipal government, the police, and the guilds, or trade unions. This has become a vital question for Germany, but those in power are seeking a solution of it in every direction but the right one; this will be the last and most unwelcome direction to them, because it will involve the necessity of their relaxing some of the manacles and handcuffs they have laid upon industry, as though it were a bad spirit requiring to be curbed. The improvement of the salaries of subaltern officials will be a prominent measure in the next session of the Prussian Diet. It is also announced as a prominent portion of approaching legislation in Baden in the speech from the throne pronounced last Thursday by the Grand Duke. In the King of Saxony's speech at the opening of the legislative session last Monday we find an improvement in the position of the State employes the very first boon that his Governmient proposes to confer on the people. In that country the finances are so prosperous that, in addition to the above. mentioned, the King was able to announce considerable contributions to public works simultaneously with a reduction of taxation. There is a larger amount of illness now in Berlin than is usual even at this season of the year, when the winter sets in suddenly. The only doubt or question on the matter is whether it is a half or two-thirds of the population that are on the sick list. Catarrhs of every description, varying with inflammation of the lungs, &c., form the staple; inflammatory internal diseases and nervous fevers, however, furnish a numerous contingent. The Minister of Commerce's son, who was lately in great danger, in consequence of injuries received by a fall from his horse, is now fortunately recovering. Baron von Humboldt is suffering much from indi,position, in consequence of having taken cold. Herr von Niebuhr, the King's private secretary, who has lately been suffering in much the same way as his Royal master, is, like him, recovering slowly as regards his bodily health, but no hopes are held out by the most skilful physicians that he will ever recover his entire mental powers, or that his present improvement in bodily health will be more than transient. SARDINIA. (mRom outR owN cornPoNDsrr.) TURIN, Nov. 20. Letters from the provinces concur in their accounts of the excitement that prevailed almost everywhere when news arrived that the first election had gone so much less favourably to the Government than had been expected. From Tortona and other towns they write that no such agitation had been witnessed there since 1848. Throughout the country those who value the Statuto and are aversa to foreign interference and priestly domination have taken the alarm, and there can be hardly a doub3 that if, as is perhaps not improbable, we have another general election within a few months, the LiDeral party will be found much better prepared. It must be borne in mind that the question at issue is vital for the liberties of Piedmont; that it is not a mere change of men or even of measures that is to be guarded against, but an attack on the fundamental institutions of the country. More evea than by the strength of the minority obtainel by the retrograde party the Liberals seem unfavourably impressed by the appearance among the new deputies of certain name, little Known, or unknown out of Piedmont, but which here recall gloomy memories of the past, painful souvenirs of tyranny and persecution such as it is to be hoped this country will never again suffer under. The return in four places of Solaro della Margherita is certainly not a pleasant speotacle for the Ministerialists, especially when La Marmora is rejected by one out of two colleges, and Rattazzi and Lanza were apparently in danger of not being returned at all. To-day's Armoni4 declares that its friends have gained a splendid victory, and that it prefers it to one that should have given them a majority, because such a sudden change (from insignificance in the last Chamber to preponderane in this) might have been dangerous to their health. Why this should be so it does not very clearly explain. Meanwhile it is persuaded that the country is with the party that the Arrnonia represents, and that it looks up with admiration and con6dence to )ella Margherita as the hero of the day and the hope of the nation. Although we do not yet know the result of all the elections, and, still less, the plars of campaign o: the retrograde party, some impatient politicians ar, 1nO papers in question were much inclined to continue the publication of their evening sheets, but they will pro. bably nowr relinquish the idea. indulging in conjectures as to the probable course of events in the new Chamber. Some think that the first thing that the Right will do will be to call upon the Government to restore harmony with Rome. A motion of that nature, put skilfully, and with an appearance of moderation, would doubtless be supported by a strong minority. But it is exactly in skill and moderation that the Right of the Chamber is reputed deficient, and the Ministerialist seem confident that their adversaries wil soon compromise themselves, either by opposing some popular measure, or by bringing forward an unpopular one, thus opening the eyes of maany of those persons whom their artifices may have led away at the late elections. The Liberal party will do well, however, to beware of that over-confidence which has just procured it a rather severe lesson, and not to underzate in the Chamber, as they did before the elections, the resources its opponents command. I regret to say that the accounts received from Lombardy of its condition and prospects are extremely unfavourable. Not only Lombards, who might be suspected of high colouring out of dislike to Austrian rule, but intelligent and observant foreigners who have lately been travelling in that country, assure me that it is in a state of utter impoverishment. The taxes have become so enormous as to ruin the proprietor. The towna are dead, and the life that has left them has certainly not taken refuge in the rural districts. The burdens on land are so great that in good years, wlien crops are plentiful, it is estimated that 64 per cent. of the revenue of the soil is gathered in by Government; so that you may judge of the landholder's condition when the crops prove indifferent, or positively bad, as is the case this 7ear with those of silk and wine. RUSSIA. A letter from St. Petersburg, dated November 16, in the Nord, says,- "News has been received here of the assassination of Prince Gagarin. Governor-General of Kutaisand Mingrelia; the assassin Is a sovereign Prince of one portion of Min. grelia, and his name is Dodech Kiliane. The motives for this crime have not transpireL" The Northern Bee pays the following tribute to Lord Redelife - "The mauvjais vouloir of the British Ambassador at Constantinople for everything which is not English, and especiaUy for everything which is Rassian, has long been no secret to us; yet the aversion he manifests towards us can. not prevent us from rendering justice to his merits as an English diplomatist. "Lord Redoliffe has studied the East; he has penetrated all the secrets of the Tarkish administration, and always ia relation with the official regions of Constantinople, he has known how to create himself a position held by no other man. Tact and skil alone could not have acquired him tnat position; a long sojourn among Mussulmen was requisite, and a permanent participation, open or secret, in all the noiinations and dismissals of Viziers, Pashas, and Ministers. " To recaU Lord Redoliffe fzora Constantinople would be tantamount for England to lose half her inflnence in the affairs of Turkey, perhaps even to losing it altogether. If the actual relations of England with France, and the remembrance of the alliance of those two countries with Turkey, should render it necessary for England to give in a little in Turkish affairs, we think that the London Cabinet would rather oonsent to change its policy in the question of the Principalities than to recal Lord Redelifo from Constantinople."
I THE DISTRESS IN NBW YORK. _- (Prom tLe New York q'joi. Inut asserlion ny large bands of men in menacing language, in the streets and squares of New York, of sundry shallow theories concerning the rrights of labour "is a fact which reflects so much discredit on the present state of popular information upon this class of subjects, that we cannot avoid making an attempt, before matters go any further, to lace the question before the working casses in its true ,;t. We would fain save them from the misfortunes w ich the teachings of demagogues are lkely to bring upon them by an appeal to their own reason, rather than by the bayonets of the National Guard. Fernando Wood, with his usual want of scruple, has been urging them into excesses and pretensions which his organ, the Herald, two days ago proposed to repress by volleys of musketry. A very little reflection, united with the emallest modicum of self-respect, may save them from the wiles of the one and the bloodthirsty menaces of the other. We perfectly understand the terrible difficulties of the position in which the unemployed find themselves at the present moment. We can understand how bard it must or a man to be Ewayed by considerations of abstract justice, or be consoled by the laws of political economy in the presence of a starving wife and children. We do not ask him to shut his ear to their cries, or steel his heart against the spectacle of their sufferings. But we do not wish him to suppose for one moment that he or his family has a right to be exempted from all share in the privation caused by the terrible catastrophe which has overwhelmed the nation. All classes are suffering from it, millionaires as well as paupers. The misfortune under wbich we are labouring is, in the largest sense of the word, a national one. We do not, as we have said, ask the workman not to writhe under it, but we ask him to bear with a good grace, with manliness and dignity, what he must bear-in suite of himself, and to refrain from courses which cannot possibly bring him relief, and which, if pursued to extremes, must lead to his ruin. In other words, we ask at his hands obedience to reason and to law, and we have to add that it is only by obedience to both one and the otber that he ean effect any change in his condition which will not be a change for the worse. The doctrine that a man has a right to be supplied with labour and wages by the Government or anybody, whether his services are needed or not, is a doctrine which took its rise in aristocratic countries in which the working classes are in a position of degradation and depen. dence, but which in America every working man should repudiate with scorn and abhorrence. The monarchs and aristocracies of Europe hold that the working classes should not he required or encouraged to think for themselves ; that they should have no influence in determining their own destiny ; that all their interests should be left in the hands of their superiors-that is, of the rich, whose duty it is to instruct them, teach them morality and religion, govern them, and find them labour and the means of support. It is to escape from this degrading tutelage and rise mto the position of free agents and full-blown men, with room for all their faculties to work and prow; with room for the largest pTogress, both moral and physical; vith a voice in the managemaent of public affairs, that the mass of foreign workmen come here. It is the possession of this proud independence that makes America the workingman's paradise. It is our boast, and we hope, ian spite of the machinatirons of demagogues, that it will long continue to be our boast, that here all are equal before the law; that each of us holds his own destiny in his own hands, and, under God, is responsible to no one but himself for the use he makes of his talents, whether natural or acquired, We vork in coumplete self-dependence. Fortune, to be sure, showers her favours unequally. Some succeed and 3ome fail, but no one tbinks of blaming his neighbour for his bad luck. The successful owe pity, and when necessary relief, to their less fortunate brethren. The former owe it as a moral obligation, but the latter cannot demand it as a right. In Europe, as the Governments and the aristocracy have so organiz-d society as to keep classes apart, render it difficult for a man to rise out of the sphere in which he was born, and undertake to meddle with and regalate almost every petty detail in the affairs of private indinviduals, when anything goes wrong the sufferers have a right to look to them for aid. Where the working man is a serf or vassal, his lord is bound to find him woriand food. But in a Republic. in which aU are supposed to be partners, on a footing of perfect equality, and in which Government is Instituted by all, simply for the protection of life and property, the right to labour does not exist, aud the n,an wbo attempts to assert such a right aoknowledges, ipso facto, that his position is one of inferiority and subjection. He makes the relation between bimself and the State, and bet%een himself and the rich, that which exists between child ana nareot, or master and slave. Will the working men of New Y'rk deliberately, and under any pressure whatever, Fo stultify themselves as to abandon the status of free citizens f'r fthat of pro6g6s and dependents? This is the political aspect of the question. In the light of abstract justice the position taken by the "hunger meetings' Is eveo less tenable. The Government Is but the representative of the city en mcase. We are all a greait company, and each taxpayer is a stockholder. What give3 any one stockbolder a right to demand labour from another? Why, we should like to know, is a bricklayer or excavator a',y more entitled to be provided with bricklaying or excavating at the public expense than a lawyer with clients or a doctor with patients? There are hundreds of lawyers in this city at the present moment who cannot find work enough to pay for their board, What should we think of them if they marcbed in a body to the City-hall, and told Mlayor Wood that if he didn't find suits for them to carry on, and pay them in beef and flour at cost price, they would b gin to plunder the houses of the rich.? Is it not lament. able that under the smaDest pressure of want, working men sbould be found ready to abandon their position of selfdependence and equality, aud cast themselves and their fianchises in craven mendicancy at the feet of the first Iscurvy politician" who chooses to play upon their passions ard thoughtlessness? We shaU probably be told in answer to all this, that hungry men cannot reason, and that though our arguments may be good, they will not produce the desired effect unless they produce bread. Well, we reply that as far &Q the mere supply of either work or food is concerned, there cannot be a worse way to come at either one or other than to demand them as a right, when every man of inteUigence in the wbole community knows there is no such righu. Threats of violent enforcement of a pretended claim alarm the rich, close their purses, parAlyze industryand enterprise, and sendacapital off to places where people are sure of nothaving their stores plundered or their safes robbed. No merchant will send his flour or his beef to New York if he knows there is a mob waiting to rob him of them, and the result wvll be that greater scarcity tha n over will follow, and prices wi rise. It is hardly necessary to remind any one with a part!isle of brains that plunder can't continue very long. No sane working man in the City supposes he could live through the winter by sacking houses. This may be done once or twice, but the law speedily interposes, avolley is fired, there is walng In hundreds of homes, the wealthy are terrified and exsperated, the fountain ot charity is dried UD, and the pOOr dupes of demagogic chicanery are left fu a worse plight thanm ever. In crises of this sort, order, reason, charity, and conciliation must do all, or nothing can be

The plaintiffs case was that aboct 60 years ago the commissioners under their Act had made an award fixing the annual consideration which tbey were to pay for the land, and that this considerxtion .had for a long series of, yoas been received as being, and. in 1826 admitted to be, a valid consideration for thc right of property they claimed in the land. On the part of the defendants it was contended that the award of the commissioners, as made in 1,797, had never been acted upon or carried out, and that the plaintiffs merely held the land at a fixed yearly rent by permissioa of the defendants. The facts of the case are brie#y As follows --In 1794 the Somersetehire Coal Canal Company obtained an Act of ParllamenS, authorizing them to take Land in the viclnity of their works under certain conditions. In 1797 the commissioners under this Act fixed the price of the land now in dispute, and Delonging to the EBsi of Wal. degrave, tien a mnor, at 3491., or 141. per annum.. No regular conveyance of the land to the company was ever executed, but the company from 1797 to 1825 had paid In one way or the other rent to Lord Waldegrave about 131. 16s. per annum In respect to land which they held of him. On the one hand it was contended that thls sum, 13' 16s., was in reality the 141. settled under the award of the commissioners in 1797; and on the other, that it had nothing whatever to do with such award, but was a mere ordinary rent paid by the company for the hize of the land they used. In support of these respective contentions voluminons evidence was read, the most material part of which, as far as the present application is concerned, ws that referring to a meeting held in Bay, 1826, to effect a settlement of the rent due to the Waldegrave estate in respect of the land held by the Caual Company. At this meeting the agents of the Earl of Waldegrave and of the Canal Company were present, when the rerit payable by the company was admitted by the respective agents to "a "a perp,etual annual rent of 144 as settled by award in 1797. 1his admission on the part of Lord Waldegrave's agent was disputed by the trustees of the estates, and in the opinion of the Court was held to be erroneous, inasmuch as it allowed the company a higher title on the land than their Acts had entitled them to, or they in any way possessed. The real question, therefore, that remained in issue was whether the admission made by Lord Waldograve's agent, when acting under an erroneous impression, was to bind the estates to a charge to which they were not legally subject. The Court considered that such an admission could have no such effect; that the rent paid to Lord Waldegrave by the Canal Company waS not paid under the award of the commissioners in 1797, but as ordinary rent; and that that part of the *plaintiffs biUl which insisted on a higher title must be dismissed with costs. With respect to the injunotion, the defendants, it appeared, could not erect bridges or otber buildings on the land with the consent either of the commissioners under the Act or of the committee of prorie.tors; and if this consent were vexatiously withheld the Conrt of Chancery might possibly interpose its authority to compel its being granted. For the present, as the bridge3 wrere not in the coUr-s of building, but were built, the question of injunction would stand over until the parties to the sUit had taken a reasonable time to consider what course it wonid be most prudent to pursue in the presence of the decision vwhich the Court, after a careful consideration of the evidence, had now expressed. Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. W. D. Lewis, Mr. Osborne, and Mr. Fischer appeared in the case

ROWLVAVT)Rq (Sittngs in Banco, beforc Lord CA.3SPBLEL and Juwti COTERIfOR Wm WTrPfAi -.4 - In this case the defendant had p]eaded " Guilty" to a criminal information, which charged him with using insulting language to a Mr. Clements, tending to provoke a breach of the peace. The defendant now appeared to receive the judgment of the Court. Mr. H. fILL, Q.C., said he appeared on the part of the defendant, Mr. Rowlands, who was anxious to express his regret for having used the language complained of; and, under the circumstances, he trusted the Court and prosecutor g-ould be satisfied. The defendant w.as willing to submit to certain terms imposed by the prosecutor. Sir F. THESIGER (with whom was Mr. Bodkin) said he appeared for the prosecutor, Mr. Clements, and he could not help expressing his regret that the defendant, Row. landg, after having offered a gross insult to Mr. Clements, should have stood out till the last moment without expressing any regret. Under these circumstances he doubted whether it was not his duty to press for the judgment of the Court. The only object of the prosecutor was to protect himself from such extraordinary outrages as had Deen committed on him by the defendant, and if the Court thought he ought to be satisSed he was ready to consent. It must, however, be on this condition-that Mr. Clements should not be put to the slightest expense ia vindicating himself from an outrage of this kind, but that the defendant (Rowlands) should pay all the costs. He (Sir F. Thesiger) felt bound to insist on this condition, and he hoped the Court would suspend pronounciDg judgment till this condition was performed. The learned counsel therefore applied that the case might stand over. Lord CAalrBELL (to Mr. Hill).-Are you content? Mr. HILL.-I am content. Lord CANIPBELL.-Be it so. THE QUEEN V.

KELLY said he was instructed on the part of Mr Stapleton to move for a rale to show cause why the trial of this information should not be postponed till after Hilary Term next. In the ordinary course the trial would take place in about a fortnight in London. Mr. Justice ERLE observed that the London sittings did not commence before the 9th of December. Sir F. KELLY said he moved on an affidavit, which stated that It would be utterly impossible for the gentleman for whom he appeared to be prepared so early for the trial. Lord CAMPBELL said that if the learned counsel men. tioned the matter to the counsel who were instructed on the other side, they might at once agree to the postponement. Lord Campbell added that the learned counsel might take a rule. Cause to be shown on the last day of term (Wed. nesday). TLE QUEEN V. THE JESTICE.; OF GLAMORGAN-3SHIRE. MEr. GIFFAIlD moved for a rule to show cause why a certiorari should not issue to the justices of Glamorgan. shire to bring up an order made by the justices in quarter sessions, with a view to its being quashed, upon the ground that it had been made without jurisdiction. Thr applicant, Abraham Xopkins, had been convicted by the justices at petty sessions of having traveled in a second class carriage without a ticket authorizing him to do so. Iiehadstartedfrom Glocester to Swansea by the South Wales Railway with a third-class ticket. At some inter vening point on the journey he met with a friend, who had procured for him a second-class ticket, and they travelled together in a second-class carriage to the end of the journey. The appellant's friend then caUed the attention of the officers of the company to the fact that he had only a third-clsss ticket; and, intending to play a practical joke upon his friend, he left the station vwth the second-class ticket in his pocket. The next day the case was brought before the magistrates at petty sesdonw, but the appellant's friend being unable to attend through tllness, the magistrates convicted the party. He then appealed to the quarter sessions, and on proof of the facts the chair. man and vice-chairman, both of whom were barristers, expressed their opinion that the conviction oould not be sop. ported. Thevnce-chairman, however, said he would take no part in the decision, as he was a shareholder in the com. pany. Thero were three other magistrates present, and they said thoy did not agree with the chairman, and ulti. mnately they overruled his opinion and dismissed the appeal. The learned counsel said his affidavit alleged that all three of the magistrates were shareholders in the South Wales Railway Company, and, being interested parties, they had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal Mr. Justice COLERTDc.E said that if the order of sessions were qusshed the conviction in petty sessions would stand. Mr. Justice ERLE said the learned counsel would gain nothin Mr. IFF.RD said he thought his cUent would gain some. thing, for his conviction had been placarded at all the sbtions. Lord CAssvnnLL said the appellant would not lose his right of appeal because the magistrates were Incompetent to entertain it. Mr. GIFFARD submitted thzt, after the case of "C Dines v. Lord Cotteoham," there could be no doubt that the jus. tices had acted without jurisdiction. The COURT granted the application.

COURT OF EXCHEOUFRt. MONMAY. NTv 92 --- - ----I V. ALWAY coTmrAHT. VWILLIAMIS V. TrIIE SADIE. (&Uttings in Banco.) Jlr. VmrsoN moved for a certiorari to remove both theze causes from the County Court, on the ground that delicate points of law might arise In them, and that the causes havlng been set down for trial by the plaintiffs before a jury which wonld consist, most probably, of five farmerF, the defendants could not have that fatr and unprejudiced trial to which they were entitled. The facts were not a little singular out of which the two actions arose. The Dlaintiffs are both farmers, occupying lands adjoining the line of railway, and on opposite sides of it. Each had placed a fine bull in a field, and each bull Vould Eeem to have strayed from its proper pasture into anotber field on opposite bides of the railway, whence they could behold each other. As soon as they came within sight the animals seem to bave been actuated with the spirit of Barry Hotapur and to have determined that the same parish could not contain two bulls, for by common consent each quitted the field into which he bad so strayed and entered upon the line of raUway, where a combat a l'oufrance commenced, such as that imimortalized by Virgil, Unfortunately, however, for the valiant combatants a superior powver intervened just at that critical moment in the shape of the " Great Western express train," which settled the dispute by smashing both animals. Under these circumstances the owner of each brought his action in the County Court to recover the value of his bull, and these actions the defendants wished to have removed into the superior court. Mr. Baron Martin, to wbom the application had been made in the first instance, thought the defendants were entitled to the writs-but imposed the terms of their not recovering more costs from the plaintiffs if tbey should succeed than would bave been carrned by a verdict for them in the County Court. To this the defendants objected, as if they were entitled to the redress they sought they ought not to be saddled with such a penalty. The CouRTc granted the writ in each case without any condition as to the costs. Rules accordingly. T11E LATE KIING GEORGE III. V. DELAMOTTE. This was a petition from one Delamotte, praying the Court to order the payment of certain moneys to him as the hoir of Peter Delamotte, his father, under the following ciroum. stances :-Peter Delamotte was a postmaster, and died a lunatic in 1814, owing to the Crown the sum of 4951., for which his lands were extended. One Bower was mortgagee of the estate, and he having bought it when sold under the extent paid into this court the purchase money, when an order was made that it should be invested by the Xemembrancer in Consols, and held by that officer, together with the accruing dividends, in trust to attend upon the suit against Mr. Delanmotte. No doubt the sum so paid was insufficienit to satisfy the debt to the Crown and costs, and the matter was lost sight of, for, though the accumulations now exceeded 3,0001., there was an entry in the Postoffice department in 1822 that the debt was written off as irrecoverable." The petitioner, hojeever, who was stated to be 80 years of age, must have heard of the real state of things, and hence this petition. The SOLICITOI-GENERI2,t and Mr. WELSqBY, on the part of the Crown, took for granted the title of the petitioner to be paid something; but on the part of the Crown contended that they were entitled to a share in the profits which had arisen from the investment as well as to the debt and interest at 5per cent, and the costs, for which, however, they did not wash to prefer any specific claim. Mr. HILL and Mr. Foo2;s (of the Chancery Bar), on the part of the petitioner, contended that the fund created by the principal and accumulated interest was to be looked upon as an indemnity fund, out of which the Crown could only claim to deduct its cnsts, and the debt and interest, and that the estate of the debtor, or his heirs, was entitled to all the overplusa A similar principle had recently been applied in Chancery in a cause of "Trevor v. Bluck," where the Court ordered such a distribution of fees which had come into the hands of a former usher of the Court more than 150 years ago, and, not having been handed over as they ought to have been at the time of receipt, had accumulated to the amount of 6,0001. and upwards, The CIIIEF.' BARON was of opinion that the claim of the Crown ought to be limited to the debt and interest on that sum, and could not he held to extend to any sbare of the profit which had accidentally arisen from the investment ordered when the purchase-money was originally paid into court and ordered to be invested. At first it appeared as though the Crown might have a joint ownership in the profits, but as soon as it was pointed out by Mr. Hill what the real nature of the fund was it was clear that the Crown could not sustain any such extended right. and meanifestly unjust that the estate should be made liable for more than the debt and interest. The claim of the Crown was for a specific sum by way of debt and costs and interest, and teat it was entitled to deduct, and no more, out of the corpus of the fund. The other Judges concurring, an order to that effect was Imade upon the petition. HiEAD V. THE EASTERN UNION RAILWAY CO:tPANY. Mr. KEANE moved to set aside an award herein on the part of the plaintiff, on the ground that the learned arbitrator had been guilty of what he must term " legal misconduct " though he bad no doubt that wlhat he had done was to bo attributable to an error of judgment. The claim of the plaintiff was for salary and on money counts, to which the defendants pleaded a set-off. During the arbitration a gentleman named Brooks was appointed by consent to go over and report to the arbitrator on certain books. TIs he did twice, and on the second occasion his report was objected to by the plaintiff on the ground that haOhad lived with the attorney for the defendant, and had discussed and prepared his report with him. The arbitrator, however, had received, and no doubt acted upon this objectionable report ; and on that ground it was contended that his award ought to be set aside. Rule nuisi granted. EX PARTE HEALEY. Mr. MILLS moved for a rule calling on Mr. Brown, the keeper of Whitecross-street prison, to answer the matters In the affidavit of Mfr. Healey, an insolvent debtor in that prison, who complained that the keeper had been guilty of oppressive and malicious conduct towards him, and had unjustly caused him to be Imprisoned in a plaoe called the strong room in the prison, where he had scanty rcom, food, air, and light, for 36 hours. The application was in form of a petition founded on a long affidavit, and proceeded under the provisions of the statute 32d of George II., cap. 28, which was entitled " An Act for the Relief of DebtOrs, with respect to the Imprisonment of their PerSoCS," and the 11th section of which enacts that, " For the more speedy punishing of gaolers, bailiffs, and others employed m the execution of process for extortion or other ases in their respective offices and places that upon petition in term time of any prisoner complaining of anY exaction or extortion by any gaoler, &c., or of any Other abuse whatever committed or done in their respective Ofices or places, unto any of the Courts of record at Westininster, or in v acation to any judge, &c., every such Courr and judge are authorized and required respectively to hear izad determIne the same in a summary way, and to make anch order thereupon for redressing the abuses so com- ed of, and for punishing such officer so complained -'goat, as they shall think just, together with the full ose of every such complaint." The learned counsel stated, ia support of his motion, that the prison ia question wa3 divided Into several wards, each of whicil contained perhaps 30 or 40 prisoners; that the diobarge of all the menial offices necessary for the preservation of health, order, and cleanliness among the occupants of each ward fell on the prisoners themselves, and that by long established custom each prisoner contributed something towvards a fund for the purohase of candles, wood, and eoap, &c. The occupants of the ward were governed by officers seleted from among the body, there being a steward and daywardens and bedwardens, the latter officers being paid oat of this fund, and generally selected from among the poorer prisoners, who, from their comparatively lower rank in life would not object to undertake duties of a menial character. The sum so subscribed was about 11. per week, and of this 9s. went to the bedwarden, but the contribution, though usually looked for from each new corner, was optional. Among otber rules was one which allowed to the oldest inhabitants the choice of particalar teats at meals and other times, and the general regulation of the ward fell upon the steward for the time being. This office was held by Mr. Eealey, when a new prisoner came named Gunnery, and Mr. Healey having explained to him, zs was his duty, the rules and regulations of the prison, Mr. Gunnery expressed his approval of them, and intimated bis readiness to subscribe to the fund. He had noi;, hov,ever, been long an inmate of the prison before he infringed upon the rules by taking the seat of one of the privileged, and the result was that by a combined movement on the pprt of the otber prisoners, who edged and pushed along the form, Mr. Gnnnery camie to the ground. At this time Mr. Brown was in the yard, and Mr. Healey pointed him out to Mr. Gunnery, with an intimation that he might complain to him if he pleased. This he must have done, for on the next day Mr. Healey was summoned before Mr,Brown, who accused him of various acts of insubordination, spoko of unfounded cbarges as having been preferred against Mdr. Healey by Gunnery, such as extortion, and, after ref using permission to him to cross-examine his accuser, put an abrupt end to the interview by showing a key, and ordering Mr. Healey Into the strong room. This treatment was now stigmatized as unjust, unmerited, tyrannical, and malicious, and it was prayed on the part of Mr. Healey that the Court would interfere for his protection, as to no other power could he apply, and call upon Mr. Brown to answer the affidavit, so that the Court might do what should seem right and just in the matter. The COURT at once granted a rule nisi, returnable on Wednesday, the last day of term. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, before Alr. Baron hLATI ande Common Juries.) The causes which came on for trial to-day did not possess any public interest. The list for these sittings was finished to-dsy.
PRP.RO(OATvTR (C.OTTPIP WT- 01 - - THE SENIOR DEPUTY REGISTRAR. (Beforc Sir J. DODSO.N.) ,4 au, UZonCIsUcon 01 a morion made Dy Dr. ADDA?sS, and assented to by the Court, for the granting of letters of ad-. ministration under circumstances raising no question of any interest or importance, Mr. C. DYN;ELEY, the Senior Deputy Registrar, was about to read a statement in explanation of the delay which had taken place in the matter in question, but was not allowed to proceed by the Court. The learned JuDGE observed that a motion had been brought before him in a regular manner and concluded, snd he could not permit the business of the Court to be interrupted. If Mr. Dyneley had any complaint to make he should do it in writing, and the Court, after hearing both sides, would decide the case if it were brought forward in time ; if not, it must go over to the new Court. At a later hour of the day the cases of Stephenson and of Beare, in which charges and counter charges were made by Mr. Crosso and Mr. Pritchard, two of the proctors of the court, against Mr. Dyneley, and by Mr. Dyneley against those two gentlemen, were called on. In the first case Mr. Crosse stated that he had not been able to give in his answer to the complaint of Mr. Dyneley, inasmuch as hlr. Dyneley had not furnished him with a copy of the complaint. YIr. Dyneley then said that the reason of his omission to do so was that the minute of the proceedings, on the last occasion when the case came before the Court, had been falsely entered in the register by Mr. Gostlina, the sitting deputy registrar, whom he further charged with having made the entry wilfully and collusively. This charge was immediately denied by Mr. Gostling, who asked to be allowed an opportuiLty of answering it. In the course of a rather long discussionn Mr. DYNELEY, with great warmth, complained that in consequence of the nnpleasant situation in which he was placed he was hardly able to perform the duties of his office, and expressed his conviction that the object of the attacks to which he had been subjected was to prevent him from occupying the position he had a right to hold in the new office about to be established. Ho appealed to the Court to allow him to protect his character, which was now assailed after he had held office for 33 years, and ho submitted that the Court had not afforded him the protection to which he was entitled. Sir Jonx DoDsoN supposed that Mr. Dyneley was now making a complaint against the Court. Be had no objection at all to that course being taken if it was done in a proper manner before a superior tribunal; bat if Mr. Dyneley had charges to prefer against other Persons he must reduce those charges to writing, and give the parties accused an opportunity of answering them. They had as much right as Mr. Dyncley to have their characters protected, and he could not therefore allow Mr. Dyneley to make long speeches and cx parte statements in that court. When any charges had been brought before him in writing,and answered in writing, and supported or rebutted, if necessary, by evidence, he would decide upon them as well as he was able. Much did he lament that matters of this kind should be brought before the Court, especially at a time when it had but a few more days to sit. The result of the discuesion was that Mr. Dyneley was assigned to deliver copies of his charges to the persons agauist whom they were made. DIVE`rT AND DIVETT V. WAARE. The will in this case was propounded by the executor of tbe testatrix, Mary Ware, the wife of Samuel Ware, of Hendon-hall, Middlesox. The testatrix died in the present year, and the will was dated the 27th of July, 1850. The only question raised was as to the due execution of the instrnment, which purported to be attested by Harriet Green and William Errington, two of Mrs. Ware's servants. It appeared from the evidence of Harriet Green that she had been called into a room where the testatrix was at a table writing; that the testatrix handed her the pen which sbe had been using, and directed her to sign her name to a paper without telling her what the paper contained; that she did sign her name in the manner required, and that before she left the room her fellow servant, who had also been called into the room, began to sign his name. The evidence of Errington was to tho same effect. The property disposed of by the will amounts to nearly 20,0001. Dr. BAYFORD, who with Dr. Phihimore appeared in sunport of the will, argued that the Court would infer from the appearance of the instrument, and from the probable knowledge of the testatrix of the formalities necessary to the due execution of a will, that it had been acknowledged by her in the preeence of the attesting witnesses, although those witnesses, from the length of time which had elapsed since the occurrence, wore unable to remember whether it had been so acknowledged or not. Dr. JENNER and Dr. WANBEY in opposition to the will contended that the evidence of the two witnesses clearly showed that the testatrix had not complied with the requirements of the Act as to attestation, and therefore that the wiU ought not to stand. The learned JuDGE said, that the will upon the face of it was properly and completely executed, and the only question was whether the evidence of the attesting witnesseb negatived the presumption of a rev'ular acknowledgment and attestation. It had been repeatedly decided that a teetator need not write his nane in the presence of the attesting witnesses, his acknowledgment of his signature in their presence being sufficient. The mere want of recollection of the attesting witnesses as to the circumstances attending the execution of a will would not invalidate it, and, in his opinion, the effect of the evidence in this ease amounted only to a want of recollecti, on the part of the witnesses, not to a positive negation of tne acknowledgment bv the testatrix of her dgnature. The Court would therefore pronounce In favour of the will, the costs to be Paid out of thn Ast.d+
COURT OF BAZNKBUPTOY, Basingha lstrcea, Nov. 23. 1N RE LEAH ISAA'S. (Before Afr. Commissioar"P (nTOTT RT, 100O bankrupt was a tobacconist, in Piccadilly, tradilng Under teat style of ' Bickard and Co.," and under which name the business is alleged to be still continued. His HONOUR now gavejudgment on the question of c¢rtificate. He referred to the aUeged circumstance of the bankrupt's brother, Malrk Wilson, having absconded between the hours of 2 and 6 o'clock in the morning, with his housekeeper, a photographic machine, and several hundred pounds worth of the bankrupt's property. The-re was the positive oath of the bankrupt to this effect, but all the circumstances were the other way. Placing himself in the position of ajusyman, it was his duty to give the bankrupt the benefit of any doubt in his mind as to her having been a gailty party to this alleged absconding of her brother and abstraction of property. In giving the bankrupt the benefit of that doubt he had very strong doubts whetner he was right. He had a very adverse impression, and his decision upon the charge must only be regarded as similar to that of a Scotch jury when returning a verdict of " Not proven." If he had not arrived at this conclusion the certificate must have been altogether refused, and a criminal indictment directed for felony. The bankrupt would receive a third-class certifi. cate, and she might consider herself fortunate.
INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, Nov. 23. IN' RE KATE ELIZABETH VERITY. (Before Mr. Commisginner PITTT.T.T1' i -lsvvear, a lasinonaoiy aressea young lady,pettioned the Court under the Protection Act. Eer debt amounted to about 1401., and were chiefly due for millinery and articles of personaldecoration. Mr. Dowse appeared to oppose for a mercer namedBuck, and Mr. Reed for Madame States, a milliner; Mr. Sargood supported. The insolvent upon examination stated that she was 28 years of age, and lived with her mother, who enjoyed an income of about 2001. per annum, wbile she herself received an allowance of 601. a-year from her friends. Madame States was a creditor for 841. for articles of dresses supplied, the last of which, charged at 15 guineas, was furnished In July, only two montbs before the insolvent filed her petition in this court. Mr. Buck claimed 261., and complained that the insolvent who represented herself to be in the receipt of a settled income, had promised to make quarterly payments, which promise, however, she had not kept. The COMM}SSIONER thought Mr. Buck ought to have withheld aU further credit when the first quarter had been allowed to pass by without a settlement, Mr. Buck replied that if he were to adopt so summary a course towards persons of apparent respectability it would soon be impossible for him to continue business. Tae learned COM31ISSIONER said the case was a very paum. ful oAe, exhibiting the sad consequences of an inordinate and unrestrained love of display. The insolvent, who had been discharged by this Court in 1852 from debts amounting to 2301., must have been nware of her inability to ay for the expensive articles which she had ordered. lie must tberefore hold that the debts had been contracted without reasonable expectation of payment, and that being the case be could not grant the protection which was asked for by the insolvent. The case was adjourned sine die, without protection.
CENTRAL~ CRIMIfNAL COURT, X". 23. The November session of the Central Criminal Court, and the first under the Mayoralty of the Right Hon. Sir P. W. Carden, the Lord Mayor elected for the ensuing year, was opened this morning. At 10 o'clock his Lordship, accompanied by Mr. Rassell Gurney, Q.C., the Recorder, Aldermen Sir J. Duke, Sir F. G. Moon, and Carter, Mr. Alder- man and Sheriff Lawrence, Mr. Sheriff Allen, Mr. Undera. Sheriff Millard and Mr. Under-Sheriff Parker, took his seat on the bench, and the grand jury were then called and sworn. The first edition of the calendar contains the names of 100 prisoners. The REcoRDER, in charging the grand jury, said that although a very short time had elapsed, not more than three weeks, sinCe the adjournment of the last session, he was sorry to see that there were no less thaa 100 prisoners in the calendar for trial on the present occasion. The cases, however, were of the ordinary character, and scorcely any of them appeared to call for any remarks from him respecting them. There was one case of a rather unusual kind, respecting which he might, perhaps, say a few words. This was a charge against a person named Powles of having become bail in a false name for a person who was committed for trial upon a criminal charge. It appeared that upon the magistrate agreeing to take bail for the accused two names were given as sureties, and when the usual inquiries were made these persons were found to be in a responsible position, and the bail was consequently accepted and the accused party was discharged from custody. The criminal did not appear to take his trial and the recognizances of the bail were estreated, but it tuzned out that one of the persons whose name had been given as a surety knew nothing whatever of the transaction, and he had been personated by some one else, and the only question for the grand jury to consider was whether the prisoner was proved to be the party who had so personated him. As this was a description of offence that was very easy of commission, he thought it was well it should be known that it was a very serious one in the eye of the law ; and by an Act of Parliament of the 1st William IV, the offence of becoming bail in a false name was declared to be felony, and the party convicted of it was liable to a long sentence of transportation. That description of punishment could not at the present time of course be enforced - but a prisoner convicted of suoh an offence would be liable to suffer penal servitude for a long period, and he therefore thought it as well, as the offence was OnD that could be very easily committed, that the consequences should be made known. He did not consider it necessary to refer to any other case in the calendar; but, through their intervention, he desired to direct the attention of the magistrates of some of the police courts of the metropolis to the subject of the depositions that were returned to this court. It appeared to be the practice at two or three of the police courts not to return the depositions of any witnesses who were called to give evidence in behalf of a prisoner, and at one court it was the custom never to return the statement made by a prisoner in answer to the charge preferred against him. This practice certainly ought to be discontinued,asit wasmost important that the judge who presided at the court where the matter was finally disposed of should be acquainted with the whole of the facts, and it was very essential for that purpose that he should know the nature of the evidence that was given by the prisoner's witnesses With regard to the prisoner's statements, also, a special form of caution was prescribed by the Aot of Parliament, and any statement made by a prisoner after such a caution ought certainly to be brought to the knowledge of the Court; but the Thames Police-court never returned the statement made hy a prisorner, and the judge who tried the case therefore had no means of knowing what answer the prisoner made to the charge when he was under examination before the magistrate. The judges at the last session had made complaints of this omission on the part of the Court a question, and a communication had been made to the magistrate upon the subject, and he hoped that what he had now stated would have the effect of remedying the inconvenience to which this Court was subjected by the course of proceeding to which he had alluded. The grand jury then retired, and the Court proceeded to dispose of the business of the session. Anne Mulby and Jane Connor, two respectablclooking young women, the former having an infant in her arms, surrendered to take their trial for assaulting Theresa M'Dermott, with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. The RECORDER, in summing up, said, it appeared to him that the case was one that might very well have been disposed of by the magistrate before whom it was originally inquired into, but as it had been sent there they were of course bound to deal with it. Hle then called the attention of the jury to the evidence, and, after a short deliberation, they Acquitted Connor, and found the other prisoner, Mulby, Guilty of a common assault. She was sentenced to be imprisoned in Newgate for one month, James Cowan, an elderly moan, surrendered to take his trial for misdemeanour, in having published certain indecent and libellous placards. The defendant pleaded " Guilty." Mr. Serjeant PARRY, who was specially retained with Mr. Talfourd Salter on behalf of the defendant, addressed the Court, and said, that the defendant had adopted the course of pleading guilty to this charge unon an understanding which had been come to with his learned friends Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Clark, who appeared for the prosecution, that he should be allowed to enter into his own recognizance to appeaz and receive the judgment of the Court upon a future occasion if he should be called upon to do so, but that no such proceeding should be taken if the offence were not repeated. The defendant, he was instructed, was a medical gentleman of great skdll and of considerable prac. tice, residing in Westminster, and in a moment of excitement he had put forth certain placards which were uadoubtedly of an illegal character, and he had explained to him that they were so, and the defendant was now satisfied that he had done wrong, and he had pleaded guilty, and would undertake not to repeat the offence. The object of the prosecution he understood to be chiefly to prevent a repetition of the offence, and as the defendant had pleaded guilty, and would be under a recognizance to appear and receive the judgment of the Court if the offence were repeated, it appeared to him that the requirements of justice would be satisfied by the course he ha suggested; and the defendant would understaid that the issuing of such placards was illegal, and that it would be at his peril if he repeated the offence. Mr. BODaNX said, that the act Imputed to the defendant -who, he believed, did carry on the profession of a medical man somewhere in Wes&minster-was the exhibition of libellous and offensive placards outside his shop ; and he was very glad that the course that had been taken by his counsel rendered it unnecessary to produce those placards in court, as they were of the most indecent and obscene description. They were also calculated to create dissension among the Queen's troops and to prevent persons from en rihng, and the exhibition also caused crowds of persons to assemble, thus occasioning a public nuisance. His learned friend had rightly stated that the object of the prosecution was to suppress this illegal proceeding, and he did not object to the course that was proposed to be taken by the defendant, beoause, if there should be any repetition of the offence, the defendant might at once be called up to receive the judgment of the Court. He added that he hoped that the defendant was acting on good faith, but he was informed that placards of a similar kind were exhibited outside the premises of the defendant at that very moment. Serjeant PARRY said, he was instructed that this was not so, and that the placards were merely of a medical character. He believed the defendant was acting sincerely in the matter, and, as his advocate, he must understand from him that if he repeated the offence he would be acting most lmproperly. Mr. L3 said, he was told that the placards now exhibited were not at all of ai medical character, but that one of them contained a most indecent attacl upon an illustrious personage. However, he should not object to the defendant entering into a recognizance to appear and receive the judgment of the Court if he should be required to do so, because if he should continue to pablish these offensive placards he could be brought up in a few hours, and tthie Cou rt w ould then deal with the case as it should The RECORDER said that, as the counsel representing the Crown were content that the course suggested by the defendant's counsel should be taken, the Court would not, of course, offer any objection; but at the same time he wished it to be understood that if a conviction had taken place the Court would have passed a severe sentence. It was essential to the public interests that offences of this description sbould be put down, and the defendant would bear in mind that if he repeated the offence he would be brought up and severely punished. The plea of "Gumlty" was then taken, and the defendsue, havng entered into a personal recognizance in the sum of 2001. to appear and receive the judgment of the Court if he should he called upon to do so, was discharged from Antonio Hill. 36, a Spanish seaman, was indicted for stabbing William Thomas, -with intent to do him grievous bodily harm. The jury found the prisoner Guitlty of unlawfully woundIng the prosecautor under great provocation, and he was sentenced to be imprisoned and kept to hard labour for nine months. NEW COURT. (Before thc COMBIMON-SERJEANT.) William Ryan and Thomas Kite surrendered to take their trial upon an indictment charging them with conspiring to commit an aEsault upon John Coppard, a servant in the employment of the London General Omnibus Company. 'lr. Robinson and Mr. T. Atkinson appeared on behalf df thd company ; Mr. Metealfe and Mr. Sleigh were for the The defendants pleaded "Not Guilty." Mr. Robinson was about opening the case to the jury, when Mr. METCALFE, upon the parb of the defendant Kite, objected to his so doing, statings he understood, after what had taken place between his client and the prosecutors, that the cbarge would not be proceeded wite, and he protested against the facts being enteredl into. Mr. RonBsOn said, he also thought an apology was to be tendered in court, but had since been informed that it was ithraw, ad h threfre adbut one course left5 and that would be tdo go ohn wiftoh the chase. neCu8 Mr. M C F saiee d , b htshcalt Ie t had not been withdrawn - theen apologynofferedby his cluent,rstrKite, still stood. it hadbee gienupo anunersandngfrom Mr, licad, oil behalf of the prosecution, that it would be accepted and Do further proceedings taken. The COMMON-SZBJEA,XT said, if that course had been adopted last sesslon the matter would have ended then. Mr. ROBINSON said, the company, then, as now, were quite willing to pursue that course. They had no feeling in the matter beyond a desire to protect the interests of their servants. Mr. MLrCAUXE then raised some further objections to Mr. Robinson proceeding with his stntement, daring which the defendant Kite, after consulting with his solicitor, leant over the dock and was about addressing the Court, when The COMMON-SMZ5JNT interposed and told him that he could not E3 heard both by counsel and in person. Mr. ECOBINSON said.they would either go on with the case or accept an apology from Mr. Kite. Mr. MARCALFE.-Mr. Kite is willing to apologize in these terms-that if he has been zuilty of anything to offend the company he is sorry for It. The COMMON.SEsJE&NT told the jury that no evidence would be offered. Mr. SLEIGEL-I am no pazty to this apology. My client was ac[uitted last session' Mr. YOBINsoN having formaly withdrawn the prosecution tne defendants were Acquiued, and left the court. Henry Chinnery surrendered to take his trial for embezzlemnent in his capacity of servant to the trasteea of the Borough-market. Mr. Robinson prosecuted; Mr. Sleigh defended.

POLICE. MASION-HOUSE.-Mr. William Whittington Morris, o? 13, Size-lane, appeared before the LORD MAYOR iu answe,r to a summons at the instance of I nr. W. J. Mtchell, Inspector of Police, charging himi with having uulawfully stored upon his premises 10,000 gallons of naphtba, to the great terror, alarm, and danger of the neighbourbhod. The Cit.) Solicitor-, who appoeared in support oc the prosecation, said it had been for a long time doubted whether it was a oniminal OfTenoe to keep explosive materials and chymical substances within crowdedL neighbonrhoos. However, the city, some time Bince, thought it right to pro. secuto in a cabe exactly similar to the present, and they indicted a person named Lester for having upon his premises a quantity of naphtha. That indictment was tried before one of the judges at the Central Criminal Court, and the jury found a verdict against the defendant, subject to the opinion of the Court above as to whether it was an indictable offence. That question was argued at great length at Westminster before the judges, and, finaUy, a decision was prononnced, the whole body, with the exception of one, being of opinion that, for any person to keep in a warehouse in a crowded city a quantity of explosive materials, which. in the judgment of reflective persons, was calonlated to produce danger and alarm, constituted an indictable offence. He was sparqd the necessity of adducing evidence in the present case; as he understood that the defendant, with great discretion, judgment, and good feeling, had intimated to the authorities that he had removed, or would immediately remove the whole of the naptha from the premises and take Caselth at no ombustible or explosive material should be agandpstdtee The defendant, in reply to the LoRD MAYOR, said he had eady agreed to give up the cellar in which tbe naphtha was storede le intended to send the naphtha to the Castom- Dr. Letheby, the medical officer of health for the city, said that naphtha was a spirit which was distilled from wood, and was called wood spirit, or wood naphtha. It was very inflammable, and was used for many of tho same purposes as spirits of wine. It would fire at a temperature of 140, whereas spirits of wine required a much higher temperature than that. A little carelessness in removing the carboys of naphtha, to say nothing of the danger of burning gas in the cellar, might lead to most serious consequences, The summons was adjourned for a fortnight upon the understanding that proceedings against the defendant would be discontinued if within that period he removed the naphtha from his premises. Mr. Thomas Piper, jun., builder, of 173, Bishopsgate. street, and Mr. John Young, architect, of 35, King-street, Cheapside, were charged, upon the information of Mr. W. J. Mitchell, inspector of police, " for that they on the 19th day of November instant, in Bloomfield-street, Moorfields, did unlawfully and indecently disinter and dig up the dead bodies of divers persons whose names are unknown, and did unlawfully, knowingly, and injuriously place and permit the said dead bodies and parts of dead bodies, then in a state of decomposition, to be and remain exposed to the open air, whereby divers unwholesome smells did arise therefrom, and the air was thereby greatly corrupted and infected, to the danger and common nuisance of all the liege subjects of our Lady the Queen there inhabitingand residing." The City Solicitor appeared in support of the prosecution, and Mir. Earting attended for the defendants, who occupied seats by the side of their professional adviser, The City Solicitor.-My Lord Mayor, this, as the terms of the summons have already informed your Lordship, Is a proceoding against these gentlemen for a nuisance at common law. I wish I could as in the last case save your Lordship the unpleasantness of hearing the evidence in this. I am sorry to say that a circumstance has come to my knowledee within the last few minutes which would prevent my taking your judgment upon whethera similar proceeding might not be adopted in the present case to the last. I am sorry to say that there are facts in this case which render it absolutely necessary that I should opee the case, and take your Lordship's judgment upon it. It appears that Mr. Y ong is the surveyor, and Mr. Piper the contractor for the erection of a school adjoining the Catholic Chapel at Moorfields. For the purpose of the erectioa they found it necessmry to excavate a portion of the burying ground adjoining to the chapel, and in the course of that operation they removed the coffins and the bodies of numerous persons interred there. It has been necessary for the city a-uthorities on various ocesasions to remove churcbes and churchyards, and the bodies have been untombed for the purpose of necessary improvements. Wherever that has been done It has been the uniform practice not only to hoard in the ground so as to prevent the indecency of pubUc exhibition, but to place a person in authority there of some position, education, snd feeling, in order to pre. vent tmnecessary violence to the feelings of the living by the unnecessary disturbance of the remains of the dead. I am sorry to say that these preeautions have been entirely neglected in the present instance. I do not desire to arouse painful feelings hy any recital of the distressing particulars of this case. They will be narrated upon oath by the witaesses who were present upon the occasion; but the circtfmstance which has just come to my knowledge which distinguishes this case in its present aspect from what I thought it was before is this :-It appears that a discovery has been made by the polce that a vast quantity of humar. bones that had been deposited in that yard have been actually taken away od sold to derlers in marine stores. (Sensation.) I am bound to say that I entirely acquit the defendants of any cognizance of any such transactions. They are both of them gentlemen probably known to your Lordship; they are weU known to me, and their name and character will protect them from the suspicion that they had any part in any such transactions but still men under their control, or who ougbt to be under their control, have been guilty of this gross outrage upon decency and upon the common feelings of humanity. I have had the heonour of conversation with the reverend gentleman, now in court, who is the officiating ecclesiastical director of the Moorfields Chapel, and I verily belive that the intended occupation of this ground as the site of a school was under the idea communicated frorm tbe Superior Board of Health that, with certain precautions and under certain circumstances, it might be right to use it for that purpose. I am sorry that the reverend gentleman had not been snuciently informed upon the subject to have induced him to communicate with the medtcal officer of health. He communicated with the superior board, but that does not discharge Dr. Letheby, our medical officer, from the task of seeing that the necessary requirements in respect to health and life are fulfiled. At this stage of the proceedings the olfactory organs of every person present convinced him of the presence of some animia substance in a far advanced stage of decomposition, arnd it was intimated to Mr. Goodman x(the chief clerk) that some of the human bones were in court. That gentleman immediately ordered them to be taken away, upon which two poUces-constables, after a good deal of lifting and dragging, removed from the court a sack which apeared to contain nearly three bushels of hones. The doors and iindows of the court were immediately thrown open, and afterthe admission of a little fresh air the business was proceeded with The City Solicitor.-Some of these remains that had been already disinterred were placed by the order of Dr. Letheby in a vault, and by the advice of that gentleman pending this investigation they will be walled-up. At the present moment the public mind is impressed with the imrportance of attending to sanitary matters, and happily no more interments take place within the city. A short time ago there was placed in my hands the following short extract from a sermon of Bishop Latimer in 1552 upon this very subject:- " And here you nay note, by the way, that tbeee citizens had their bur; inW ple witbout the city, wbhch, no doubt, is a laudable thiDng; an I uo marvel that London, being so rich a city, bas not a burying place without. for no doubt It is an unwholesome thing to bury within the city, specIaly, at sucha a tIme when there he great sicknes, so that msny die together. l think thae many a man taketh his death in Paul's-churchyard, and thitt I seak ot experience, for I myeelf, wben I have been there to hetr thesermorrno,have felt such an Il-favoured nunwolerome savour thatlI as the wortse for it a greet whileafter. AndI tinkno eerhutit e te ocasontofmuch sickne8ssand disreases. therefore, the citIzes of Nathrad a ugood and laudable CUdteD to buty theIr corses without the city, vhich ensamplo we may After a lapse of 300 years the citizens of London have receied the opinion thus promulgated by Bishop Latitoer. I am sorry to see that in the vsnlts be low the Roman Catholc chapels, as in the vaults of many of our churches, there is an awful accumulation of this festering material, the consequence of which it is almost impossible wholly to exclude from the external air. Mr. Harting,-W% ill the City Solicitor be good enough to mention the precise nature of the charge against the defendants? The City Solicitor.-Under the Central Criminal Court Act It Is rendered, if not absolutely necessary, yet desirable that-we should bring every case in which there is a contemplative prosecution into this court, and have the evidence stated and the witnesses subjected to crossexamination, in order that the defendant may know what he has to meet. In the exercise of my discretion and in conformity with the intention and object of that Act I have summoned the defendants here to-day. Mr. Harting.-My clients are most anxious to give every information in their power to thoeprosecution. They are very much surprised at this charge being brought against them. The circumstances connected with the bones have only come to our knowledge within the last few minutes. Under these circumstances it would be advantageous to us to have the opportunity of a few days' delay. I ask now for an adjournment. The City Solicitor.-I think the application is a perfeotly fair one, and ought to be complied with; but it must be with the undertaking that the defendants will render us every assistance in the meanwhile to apprehend the men who had been guilty of selling these bones. Mr. Piper.-We are only too anxious to assist in the matter, If the case had gone on we should have brought forward two trustworthy men, one of whom looked up the gate at night, the place being surrounded by a high wall. Both of these men declare that they believe it to be utterly impossible that the bones ceuld have come from the spot in question. The place in which the bodies were put has been built up with a brick walL The further hearing of the summons was then ad. journed. BOW-STREXT.-Catherine Lewis, a girl of notoriously bad character, was charged with knocking down an ostler named William Coleman, in Holborn, at a late hour on Sunday night, and stealing from hiu a valuable Isle of Skye terrier, The constable on duty in Holborn, F 141, had onceo already rescued the prosecutor, who was drunk, from the clutches of the prisoner and aparty of her comrades, and, seeing that they were still followmg the man, though on the opposite side of the way, he watched them. The prisoner crossed over to the prosecutor and at one blow felled him to the ground, at the some time snatching up the dog, with which sheranaway. Theconstable followed and overtook her, retained the dog for the prosecutor, and tok the prisoner in custody, The dog, wrhich was produced in cour, was a part icularly fine on e. She was committed for one month, Jeremiah Lomasney, a post-office letter-carrier, was sum. moned for delaying his delivery by loitering. He did not answer tohis name. M[r. JARDINE fined him 51. Mr. JARDIsN has received 11. Is. for the poor-box from G. M. H.' An acknowledgment in T7ih Times was requested. WORSlP-STREET, - George Badcock, landlord of the Marion Arms, Pritchard's-row, Hackney, was charged with the following atrocious assault upon bis wife. The wife, a good-looking woman of 30, was supported into court at the nlst examination by two officers, who helped her up into the witness-box; but the poor woman was evidently in such an agony of suffering, grief, and dtbility that the Magistrate instantly ordered her to be remnave and placed in a chair. Almoet inarticulate from pain, she Eaid,-I have been married ten years to the prisoner, by whom I have had four children. On the evening of Friday se'nnlght he came home with a new horse he had jnst purchased, as I was standing at the door, and said he should have that horse. I ventured to tell him that he had better not bny the horse, as he had lost by all the others he had bought; and I added that he had much better stop at home and attend to his business, instead of leaving a poor child only eight years of ago to take care of it for so many hours, or we should certainly be ruined. He buys horses of horae-copers, as they are called, and invariably loses bz them. The moment I had spoken the words be raised ais fist and struck me such a terrible blow upon the Jaw, under the left ear, that he nearly broke it andIstaggereda gainst a cart standing near, and fell againt tewaeofit. He then kicked me violently upon the loins and other parts so badly that I cannot walk. With great pain and difficulty Icontrived to drag myself up by the w eel of the cart into some neighbours' arms, and they carried me away. Mr. RA4,mny,-EHas he ever treated you in this brutal manner before? Wife.-Oh dear, yes, Sir, for years, and I know he will kil me; Iaam sure he wi/L The night before this he beat me cruelly and dragged me about the ground by my hair. On the Tuesday before heosharpened a carving-knife, as he said, for the purpose of murdenng me by cutting my toroat. He swears he will bring me to ruin, calls me the worst names he can think of, and says I shall support my children by infamy. Mary Anne Pelham.-l am a married woman, living next door to the prisoner, whom I saw strike his wife upon the neck, and afterwards kick with the greatest violence. She was very lanme when she went indoors, and I saw that she ws bleeding from one of her ears She is a very industrious woman, and always perfectly sober. Police-constable 326 N.-I was called to the house to take the prsoner into custody for asmulting his wife, whom I foun bleeding from blows, but on my attempting to secure him he resisted very outrageously, and struck me violently in the chest with his fist. Mr. HAxm1LL (to a respecthble-locking woman -who was supporting the wife In her arms).- She appears to be dreadfully ill; has she been examined by any medical gentle. man? Woman.-Not yet, Sir, as her own doctor lives some distance off, and, from the Injuries she has sustained, she will not have any other. The prisoner has given her one kick on the lower part of her stomach, which has very much Injured her, and I am afraid will be found very dangerous. Mr. HA3LTILL instantly adjourned the case, ordering the woman to be taken home carefully in a cab, but she became so distressingly sck and iUl that she was supplied with re8tonatives, and a long time elapsed before she had sufficiently recovered to be removed, the prisoner listening to her cries and suffering with the greatest apparent indif- At this examination the woman seemed scarcely any better. She was bent almost double from some internal injury, looked deathly pale, and was again obliged to be seated, She this time handed in a certificate from her physloisn, as she described her attendant, which stated her to be still in a very dangerous condition. She was only de. tained till. hs deposition could be completed and read over, and then led away. In defence the prisoner Wsid,-I had had a little drop to drink and do not recollect anything about it. I am now very sorry, and hope you will look over it as well as yoa can. Mr. H.cimL -No. this is an atrocious assault, aud of far too deep a magnitude for me to deal witb. You have most likely crippled this poor creature for life, and I shall send you. for trial for it. SO1JTTwAlR.-William Webb, a blacksmith, wag cbarged with committing a violent assault on Charlotte Web , his wife. The complainant, a middle-aged woman, vho exhibited a severe wound on the right eye, stated that she had been married to the prisoner 22 years, but for some time past his oonduct had been so bad that she could not live with him, In fact, she had been compelled to leave him five times and! maintain herself. On Saturday night she heard a knock at the street door, and on opening it the prisoner rushed into the passage and struck her on the right eye, nearly stunning her. Hie was about to repeat his violence when a constable came towards them and took him into custody. She had, however, no wish to punish him, provided he kept away from her. Mr. BuIcumn told the prisoner that he was a cowardly fellow to strike his wife in that manner. She appeared to be a decent woman, and couid do very well without him. Under the circumstances he should sentence him to three months hard labour in the House of Correction at Wands. worth. Mr. BuRcAmr has received 2s. 6d. in postage stamps from "S. P. B.," and the like amount from " D. C. L ," for the poor man Apps, who has lost his eyesight througl violence. lHe has also received lOs. in stamps from "I . W.," 3s. from "e.

Sir,-Tnto-day'sreportofthe openingof Exeter-hallonSun. day evenings it is stated that the employment of the litany by the IRev. W. Brock vsas probably the first irnstance of a Dissenter udng the Anglican liturgy. Permit me to say that there are many Dissenters, besides Wesleyans, whop regulhrly use the morning and evening service of the Prayer. book, with very few, and these merely verbal, alterations., I m ht mention Spa-fields Chapel and Surrey Chapel im London, and the Rev. Mr. Sortain's church at Brighton. Dissenters, as such, do not object to the order of Common Prayer, but only to a few expressions in it, and to the en. forced declaration of assent and consent to everything contained in that book. They refuse to have even a good thing enforced as essential, when it has been left free by the Creat Head of the Church. Let the church of England liberate. herself from the stigma of State support and the bondage of State control, and let her employ this liberty of self-action in leaving optional those matters of detail which are not essential to Christiani dectrine or to a church's true mission, and then Dissent will be comparatively needless. Till then it wiFlll more and more secure the sympathies of the great masses of the neonle. A LITURGICAL DISSENTRR MUWn WUD, NOV. Y;J.
TIz NFw HousEs OF PABLIAMENrT.-The handsome portico erected over the Lords' entrance is entirely finished. A few yards from it a stone bench has been laid down for the convenience of peers to dismount who may come down to the House on horseback; between it and the entrance a handsome carriageway has been constructed, and over the portico four magnificent lamps, hand-omely gilt, are now being placed. In the entrance to the lobby of the House of Commons two frescoes are just comnleted. The one is the execution of Montrose, forhis zesl and fidelity to his Sovereign; and the other the escape of Charles, after the Battle of Worcester, throu-h the instrumentality of Alice Lee, the daughter of Sir fienry Lee. Both have been executed by Ward, who appears to be the only artist employed during the recess in adorning the new Houses of Parliament. The interior of both Houses remains exactly the same, nor have any other alterations taken place than those just described. Tnux AcxmICA NAAVAL StvicCm.-The United States' sloop of war Saratoga was commissioned at Boston on the 6th of September, 1S55, and ordered for duty in the home squadron. Her crew consisted of men transferred from the Ealmouth sloop of war, which had been ordered home tn consequence of yellow fever on board. There was also a transfer of men from the receiving ship Ohio. The majority of the men thus transferred had less than two years to serve. They had rather a hard time of it in the West Indies, but were sent there again, and immediately the Saratoga, after cruising about the Wes Indies and Cen. tral America, and after sojourning for four months at Nav; Bay, was ordered to Norfolk in December, 1 56. This pleasant transition from the tropics to Xorfoik in midwinter may have Riven proof of the immense sagacity of 'he Secretary of the Navy, but it had rather a hard effect uponL the constitutions of the sailors. Some of them, it is stated, have not yet recovered from the shock. The Saratoga was provisioned and sent back to the West Indies. The ship was shorthanded from desertion and other causes, and divers greenhorns were induced to come on board with the fu.Uunderstanding that their services would not be required for more than eight months. The captain and bis executive officer have since been detached from the ship, but his dupes are still on board, and are in. formed that they can be legally detained for any period less than five years. Last May the Saratoga again visited Norfolk, and was despatched again shorthanded (and this was only a natural result) uun an indefinite outward. bound cruise. Many men were almost entitled to disebarge. Upon learning that the ship was again ordered to the WVest Indiea, they petitioned the Secretary of the Navy for relief. They petihoned in vain; every day of the three years must be exacted. But they were told that as their terms expired they would be discharged and sent home. Loug ago those penods of service expired, but the men are still doing duty on board. Some of them have offered to pay out of their own pockets tho price of a passage to Norfolk, but the comnmanding officer has utterly refused to grant any discharge. It is further complained of that the sailor is allowed no run on shore, being sometimes detained on board eight, 10, and 12 months. All this looks to us very much like swindling and tyranny and cruelty. We want efficient sailors, and to get them we must treat recruits equitably. If a man ships for three years he should be at liberty to go at the end of three years; and especially if he can be disobarged without any special expense to the Government.-Ncwv York Timrc.

MB. AZBEBT SMITH. Last night Mr. Albert Smith threw open his doors for the frta time this seaosn, and tho Egyptian-bali was at once filled inot only to repletion, but to repulsion, the cases of nonriSnmldon for want of room being formidably numerous, ILoud acolamations greeted from aUl sides the prince of " entertainers" as soon as he made his appearance, e-id he returned the welcome not only with the formal bow, bat *wlth a famliar imitation of a shake of the hand. The entertainment is completely remodelled from beginsdng to end. Indeed, we can saarcely say what is left of the earHier exhibition save the talent and good-humour of Mr. Smith himself, which, of couse, remain unaltered and unalterable. The " Ascent of Mont Blanc," which 's still noninally the subject of discourse, has been reduced for a Ion, time to the rank of a moving panorama, displayeci while Mr. Smith rests himself between the acts, and last might the picture of the Rhine was used as & mere Introduction to the whole, and indeed completely u4ed up, before Mr. Smith emerBed from his little door, and uttered a grave exordium fashioned on the model of Bacon Me ^aulay. His first part, which is occupied with Switzerland, is to a great externt new in matter, and completely new In form, terminating with a fresh medley song, entitled "Browaon his Travels." This song at once displays Mr. Smith's powers as a comic poet and a comic vocalist The words are distlugnished by the same felicity that is perennially exe mpliied in the ever-varying Gatignani's Mes3enger; the utterance of them, which reouires the greatest rapidity of articulation, is marked by sallertliges .ed Mr. Charles Mlathews.thraliges The second part of the entertainment, which is new throughout, is devoted entirely to Naples and its vicinity, Mr. W. Beverley having furnished seven beautiful pictures, successively Trpresenting Naples itself, as seen from the heights of Pausilippo; the Santa Lucia, the "houseof the tragic poet" at Pompeii, the ruins of Pssstum, the blue grotto at Capri, and the ascent and eruption of Mount Vesuvius, the latter bein" a real explosion, with aU the effects of flowing lava and falling ashes. In drsoribing his Italian excursion Mr. Albert Smith less aims at being continuously comio than is his wont, and while at Plompeii seems ever on the point of becoming the grave lecturer. But his mirthful spirit refuses to assume for any length of time the tone of serious instructioa; he finds his old friend Miss Simmonds married to a lergyman, and elicits a world of pleas-antry from tho meetOmng, and, better still, ho finds his yet older friend the on. gineer. who keeps the audience in a roar with a fresh gri evance as dreamy and unintelligible as the woe of former days. So deeply have the previous entertainments of Mr. Albert Smith been imprinted on the public mnind that if he revives a character created years aoo the voice and manner are at once recognized as those of familiar acquaintance, and no explanation is needed. Who does not know theengineer and the Nsrgilhypipe? Whoisignorant of the impetuous Florence Simmouds (now Mrs. Septimus Bandy) and the " Baby Simmonds," who always reveals truths, most unwelcome to her ow') family, but most welcome to the audience ? Bursts of applause foUowed the eruption of Vesuvius, which concluded the entertainment, and Mr. Albert Smith, who had retired, was once more summoned from his little door to receive the congratulation of his patrons.
TH-E SMITHESTREET REFORMATOBY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Afew days ago a letter appeared in The Times signed "Colonel Stace," asking aid generally for the Smith-street Reformatory, and especiallyfor a ticket-of -leaveman (his-wie and three children), who had passed tbrough the period of ppunishment for his but one ofenc3-the only offence that -we know of ! He had tried hard, we are told, but without success, to get money enough to emigrate to Canada, where he would get four times the amount of good things that h2s Euglish esrnings would get-a blei-ng that thousands of honourable labiurers, honest and self-denying, desire, but without hope. The "poor tickeb-of-leave" then got work at a law stationer's for awhile, and is now on the verge of stirvation. Indeed ! Surely neither the poor ticket-ofleave nor yet Colonel Stace need be told that there are manblons (unionriouses) in London and all over the kingdom where this fanily can knock and demand admittance, food, and shelter. v:th as bold a front as any nobieman can demand admittanco to his own mansion. He need not commtt any new crime, nut even murder, the. 3fore-a thing we have been told ia your journal has been perpetrated more than once because the Reformatory cau'; or could not take in the like of him. There is no excu8e for these appeals made to the thoughtless and kind-bearted to aid the funds of these so-ca '.cd reformat Dries, because the exuviie of our gaols can't alwvays be so disposed of and get work of the easy kind they ohose to do, and get also the luxurious entertainment bestoweed by the foolish persons who manage such places. Many of these ruffians leave our comfortable gaols having re ilved, according to Colonel Stace, " large sums of money from the Government, of which the greater part goes into the hands of the publican ;" and why so! Because they have no min to work, and don't intend to work while they can pass a winter in an English palace-gaol, or retire into a reformatory and betaught a handicraft, For many years past no losan of average ability, either as a skilled or unskiUed labourer, need walk and wait many days, nor expend the 101. or 12, he has received as a compliment on leaving prison, before he can get work. If he be a mechanic, he may start on the tramp, and as a shoemaker, carpenter, saddler, &c., soon enter a shop and get work, and no questions asked; he need not go necessarily to the scenes of his former crimes; and if he be a. unskilled labourer, as a hodman, a navvy, a scavenger, he may get employment at once. Perhaps I hardly ought to indicate that such interesting beings should earn an honest penny as dustmen or scavengers, but really that labour which an hononrable man gladly does a repentant thief would more readily undertake were he not encouraged in crime and made dainty by the reformatory. Crimeo will ever increase, rogues wil not turn honest, nor vill honest men continue so, while our prison-palaces, as Holloway and Reading, and our sumptuous reformatories (I use the word sumptuous advisedly), as Smith-street and ledhUll, bestow habitually a measure of comfort and luxury that ordinary workmen, while they remain honest, have no chance of onjoying. Our home missionaries, ourPoor Law officers, can tell how live the porters, the costermongers, and many of the ratepayers of London. The labourn'g people of the country get no meat nor a drop of beer by the weeks together, and they are clothed in unwholesome rags. Some time since I visited the Reformatory in Smith- street. I found a building of thick solid waUs, and, except in respect of decorations, as comfortable as a palace ; baths hot and cold; dormlitories large, light, and airy; good beds, one to each gentleman; a fire was burning in the bed room in the middle of the day; the blue and white dinner d'shes and lates were being washed up, and the smell of the London Tavern was never more savoury. The gentlemen had just left their dining-hrll.-no term of exaggeration (au hoaest ploughman dines agatnst a hedge or in a stable amid the stench of horse-muck)-and they were in their drawing-room (another fine hall-let doubters go and see), wbere was an organ and a huge three-feet globe. The weekly dietarY is as follows:- ToTAL, IVEIXLY. lb. oz 3Monday-Bread . 9 133 Tueaday-Meat . 1 8 Wedneeday-Pota' P3 4 0 Thursday-Cheese .. 0 14 Priday-Soup . S pints. Satu xY ay-0coa0 .. .. .. .. .. .. 14 , .s;. Mce azbstltuted for pobatczJ, and batt3r for cheeze, oes Sionaily. With such a state of things increase o' education will certainly increase crime. Our enduring fellow-covrtrymen have only been able to read and to understand Tltc Times day by day to come to the conelusion that rone but an honest fool will work hard in a wet c'7.ypit for s. 6d. a-day. Let these facts be known among the labouzers on the wilds of Cranborne Chase, those heroes of humble life whose daily self-denial and aching bones create that rer.t which Lord tihaftesbury lavishes on the Smith-street menagerie, and burning nnder this, to their minds, great injustice they will strike work, and tuirning thieves seek the comforts and luxuries of the prison and the reformatory. As honest men they may dine upon dry bread and an onion, as thieves they may pass out of prison. with 101. or 121. in their pocket (a fabulous sum of treasure to any of Lord Shaftesbury's Dor. setshire labourers), which when spent in riotous living they may find a comfortable bome in a reformatory, and there be taught a trade which wiU relieve them from hard work in all weathers, and in the end be sent to Canada, there to earn 6s. or Ss. a.day. The same thing with their sons; a poor man who brings his son up to hard work and honesty hardly as a matter of money calculation does his duty by him; for if as a thief he should be consigned to Rledhill Reformatory, a place far more delightful than even Smith-street, he will be taught a trade, be fed luxuriously-at lebat in his notion; with a full complement of clothes he will be sent abroad, and do weU if he become not an unannealed scamp. The cost of the Redhill plade no man knowvs; it is eiormou-; merely for the food, washing and mending, the fuel and lights, the cost for eAch young gentleman thief is 17/. 15s. Gd. a-year ; and, as a matter of comparison, those saine items cost atthe Orphan School, Haverstock-hill, 111. 10s. a-year eash child. Surely the orphans ought not to he worse taken care of than the young thieves ! It Is a good proof Of the improving seneo of benevolent persons that the funds are not forthoomiinlg to keep up these mnstlttosss for the reward <asd enoeuragemuent of crime, for suoh indeed they are. Colonel Staco urges subscriptions. Money spent in the most frivolous manner on balls and theatres, on opera tickets and whitebait dinners, on pictures, statues, and musio, will do much less harm, and even nuch snore good, than spent in the support of institutions where honest, self-denying industry, put out of countenance, is being lef' to saffer and repine, while rascality is painpered and solaced. I know that such comparisons as these are constantly being made by wvorking people, and to the deterioration of the national morality. Your obedient servant. I. H, E. Cannon-treet, Nov. 22.
