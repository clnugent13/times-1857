It is the nearet Hospital to 400,000 of the very poorest of the ilahabitaute of Lonaon. 1,M8 In-patients end 25,864 out-patients received relief Last year. The old parish workhouse was, In the first Instance, taiken on lease, repaired, and fitied up by the Committee. This bauiding afforded, in 1839, ample accommo dation for the 4,831 in and out patienta of that In ~the year 1819 the largeIncrease, of patients made It neceesry to increase the accom-modation. and by the mnunifient generosity of an unkown friend to the Charity, and other most noble gifts, a sufficient sium was raised to purchase an adequate site for a ver large building, bnd to complete about onehbalf of an entire.New Hospital. The Committee were3 for some t-ime of opinon that thopotn of the work completed by maeans of the effort coDmmenced in 1859 world meet svery present want, and that it would not be necessary for many =srto build toe remainuder of the New Hosptal ; hut in this view tey find themselves entirely mistaken. The folowing clrcmastanose have compelled them to renew their labours and agaln to appeal for ho?The large and Increasing number and neoeestieg of the sick poor Eeeldug relief. There were last year 155 more in-patients and 1 780 more oat-patienta then in 1855; and already, durn the first four months of this year, there have been maLny hundred more patients than in the corresponding timne last year. The Committee added 18 bedsf to the Hospstal during the Year 1818, but additional room is enlyrequired for the sick poor seeking relief from the Charity.

The House then went into committee upon this BilL Clause 1 having been put, Mr. DUNLOP explained the object of the Bill to be to simplify the laws relating to registration in Scotland, and to extend their operation to the case of long leases. The LORD-ADVOCATE expressed his approval of the measure. As the law at present stood the " land rights" in Scotland might be registered either in the register of the county within which the lands were situated or in a general regiqter, and the Bill provided that leases for a period not less than 31 years, which were not now subjected to the operation of the law, should be registered in the same way. The Faculty of Advocates objected to the Bill upon the ground that it would interfere with the rights of the landlord, but he did not think that such would be its operation. The efect of the measure twould be, he might add, not merely to provide a record of leases open to inspection,i but to maxe long leases of land a proper subject of security fordebt, and the landlord could not fairly be said to have any interest in the matter. It had long been his intention to move the issue of a commission to inquire into the state of the registration in relation to boroughs and counties in Scotland, and he believed considerable improvements might be effected in the present system. That question was one, however, which required some considers. tson, and he should in the meantme give to the BiU of his hon. and learned friend his cordial support. The clause was then agreed to, and the Bill passed through committee, Mr. Dunlop undertaking to fix the next atage of the Bill at a day sufficiently remote to enable the members of the legal profession in Scotland to take its provisions into their previous conrideration. INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS BILL The House went into committee on this BiL Clauses up to No. 4 inclusive were agreed to. In clause 5 Sir G. GREY suggested the insertion of words providing that the magistrates shoald not remand a child in order that inquiries might be made as to the circumstances of its parents, unless they received satisfactory evidence in support of the charge on which it was brought before them. Mr. ADDERLEY accepted the amendment, and it was agreed to. Lord E. HOWARD expressed a fear that the provision of this Bill which gave power to a policeman to arrest and take before a magistrate any child who might ask for a halfpenny from a passer-by would operate oppressively towards the poor. Sir G. GREY said that this Bil constituted no new offence. It only provided that, instead of sending a child guilty of vagrancy to prison for a month, a magistrate might send him to an industrial school. Ir. PAL T thought there ought to be introducod into the Bill a provision that parents should have sufficient notice before their children were disposed of. Mr. G. H. MOORE oomplained that the managers of a Protestant reformatory in Glasgow had refused to allow a Catholic child to accompany its parents to Ireland, and that the right hon. baronet the Home Secretary had confirmed their decision. Sir G. GREY promised to inquire into this case. Mr. DE VERE objected to the principle of this clause. Although no new offence was created by this Bill it would produce new consequences, and would apply them to a class of society to whom their application was most questionable. Mr. ADDERLEY defended the Bill, the object of which was to provide tutelage and care for children who had none. In reply to an observation from Mr. C. BuXTON, Sir G. GREY said that a policeman must not be called "officious " because he arrested a person for begging in the streeb. (Hear, hear.) Such a practice was most injurious, both to the persons who adopted it and to deserving objects of charity. At the suggestion of Lozd GoDEBItoH, Mr. ADDERLEY promised, at a future stage of the Bill, to introduce into this claiuse words rendering it clear that the magistrate need not necessarily remand a child to prison. Mr. EMADLAM and Mr. BLANDFORD supported the clause. Mr. FOLJAMBE thought that a good deal must bo left to the discretion of magistrates, who would easily decide whe. ther or not a chUd should be dealt with under this Act. Mr. MAGUIRE said that by this Bill, if an Irish labourer who had been employod for two or three years in London were thrown out of work, and one of his boys went into the streets under the pressure of necessity and begged, a ma,istrate would have the power of arbitrarily severing the ties between parent and child. Mr. DUNLOP saw no danger in a magistrate being allowed to remand a chUd found begging for a short period. The security required from the parent was only 1i.; and it should be remembered that the object of the provision was the good of the child. Mr. rACKBLOCK suggested that the clause should only apply to young persons who are " well-known beggars or vagrants." Mr. EENLEY pointed out the confusion that would be produced by the language of the clause. The words it contained were " vagrancy or begging," implying that there was a distinction between the two; and thereby creating an entirely new offence. Begging in itself was a species of vagrancy, and was now included under the head of that offence. Was it intended by this clause that if a child who swept a crossing asked for a halfpenny he should be taken into custody ? They wore told, mdeed, that the BlM was to be restricted to acts already within the scope of the law, but the words used opened a very wide door to laxity of interpretation. No doubt Il. seemed a smaill sum to he exacted from the parent as secuity, but it should also be remembered that when a poor man went before a magistrat and entered into reoognizances he was mulcted in a considerable amount for fees. With regard to the power of remand, there was no place to which a child could be sent by a magistrate except to a gaol or a staion-house, neither of which were suitable for such a purpose. These were all points which required careful consideration, and unless the clause were eo amended as to obviate the objections he had indicated he should havo no alternative but to oppose it. Mr. BAINES said the observations of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Henley) showed that the clause needed revision. The Government desired to make the Bill as perfect as possible, and if its present defects were not removed, the object of its introduction would be defeated. The pro. moters of the meLsure did not wish to ereate a new offence, but to provide a newniode of dealing, in the case of children, wItn Wban existing oilence. imOgg-g was an offence under the present Vagrancy ct, and ihetforefhtheeistinction set up by the phraseology of this clause couldonly produce ambiguity. The place to which children taken into custody under the provisions of the Bi should be remanded ought also to be bcetter defined. Mr. ADDERLEY was quite ready to omit the words or begging," and to retain merely the word "vagrancy." He I ad notadopted the present phraseology of the clause from any love ef tautology, but sumply because he had felt bound to follow the language of exiSting local and general Acts against vagrancy. With regard to the other objections t4on t4othe wording of tho clause, he hoped, as they were all a,greed en the principle, that the clause wrould now he 'dtan h necessary amaendmaents reecrved till the urangng up of the report. Mr. HENLEY could not admit that they were all agreed upon the principle. It would be very convenient if the hon. gentleman (Mr. Adderley) would inform the committee of the nature of the effenes specified in the local Aots to which he had referred. He (Mr. Henley) wa-a.not aware that the present law distinguished between begging and v -n c. A grea principle was involved in the question wheer a child was to be remanded to a gaol or to some other place; and the clauce ought to be postponed to enable that point and others to be cleared up. M.r. ADDERLEY again expressed is wilingness to insert w7ords on the report to prevent cbildren from belug re- manded to prison. If Wb e committeo could not a20ept that promise let the clause ba postponed. Mr. BOWYER thought this a highly penal Bill, as it would enable a chid to be taken into custody and kept there for a whole week, even though the place of its confinement mnight not be a prison. Its provisions shouldtherefore be restricted to the case of the habitual vagrant, and ought not to apply to any child who, under the pressure of temporary want, was found begging on a single ccasion. As this clause was to be postponed he wished now to give notice of an amendment to the effect that when one of these poor children was taken into custody, not only should the Eprent or the person with whom it was known to have been !set residing be apprised of the fact, bhb that the same intimation should be given to the minister or officiatin clergyman of any churen or chapel which the child or itS migh have usualy, or from time to time, attended. Snehts aprovision would throw an additional protection around t&is unfortunate class, and tend to mitigate the evils to be apprehended from the clause in its present shape. Mr. BRISCOE suggested the insertion in this Bill of the corresponding elause from the Scotch Industrial Schools Act as a means of obviating difficulties. That dause empowered the sheriff or magistrate to remand a child for 48 boors to the poor-house, for the purpose of instituting the necessaryinquiries previous to sendmng it to an industrial school. 3fr. PEASE, however favournble to the objects of the Dil, could not support it, because the means by which it was sought to carry it ou trenched so dosely on civil and religious liberty. Mr. BALL hoped that when the principle of the measure-vizs, the substitution of eduaetion for puolashmentwas so excellent, the imperfection of some of its details would not be allowed to caase its total rejection. Mr. ADD5IRLEY consented to withdraw the clause in the meantime. Mr. NEWDEGATE could not seeto what other body the temposry custody of these children could be entrusted but the paroe' authoritis. Lord GODERICHE observed that this last suggestion came a:month too late, and ought not to be acceded to. Mr. EIENLEY recommended, now that the clause was to be withdrawn, that a discretionary power should be gnted to magistrates of sending to industrial shools children who come under the provisions of the Reformatory Schools Act. That would greatly simplify the measure, and remove all dificulty as to the class of young pereons uith whom they should deaL Mfr. W. MILES.-It would be anjust to place children apprehended under this Bil in reformatory schoo2s, whico were intended for criminal chidren. Industrial schooil and reformatory schools should he kept perfectly distinct Sir G. GBEY.-It is questionable whether any industrial schools will ever be built, and magistrates ought therefore to have the power of sending vegrant chidren to the reformatory schools. Mr. ADDERwLEY.-There are already several industrial sohools, and I have no doubt that the passing of this Bill will immediately call many more into existence. The clause was eventualy struck out, on the understand ilg that, upon the bringing up of tne report, Mr. Adderley should submit a new clause. On clause 6 being proposed, Mr. W. MILES said that it distinctly gave to magistrates the power which he complained of-viz., to send vagrant rogren to reformatory schools, and he therefore moved its omisson. Mr. HENLEY suggested that, inasmuch as the very pith of the BiUi-vis, the cth clause-had been struck ont, and the clause under discussion, as well as several sucoceeding clauses, depended upon it, the chairma ought toreport progress. (EIear.) Mr. ADD ERLEY said the Bill would do very well without the 5th clause, and objected to the chairman reporting mrogress so Late iu the sesioe asa vitalrejection of the fr. 6. M IILuES appealed to thee oe to let the Bill class as it stood, because he knew that the hon. member Mr. Adderley) had cestowed great pains upon it, and believed that it would be a very useful measure The warquis of BLetoDFORiD objected to a postem new ment of the Bilu, bt suggested the withdrwal of clauses from 6 to 10 inclusive, as they were conected with the clause just struck o ut. Mr. BEA OEY disclaimed all intentio of getting rid of the Bill by a sdewind. He, however, thought it would be mere waste of time to discuss it until the House knew the nature of thec tb shbstituted for clause 5. As the Bill nowa steed everybody might be apprehended by the police. (Laughter. ) cfter some further discussion, nl which Lord GondisCl, Mr. AM'MDoN, Sir G. GBXY, and Mr. ADDaBLeY took part, The clause was struck out. On clause 7, mlr. BARROW said that, inasmuch as the Court o Queen's Bench had determined that wherever the wond "may" occurred in Acts of Parliamentiwith reference to the exercise of magisterial powers it was to be construed as if it were " must" or " shall," the words in this clause "may send such child to an industrial school," would deprive magistrates of all discretion to dismiss cases if they should think fit. He thereforeproposed the insertion of certain words which would enable magistrates to dismiss charges if that should seem to them to sethe best course. Thr. AmDERLEY assented. Mr. BOWYER objected to the clause, as introducing an anomaly and a novelty into the laws of England, inasmuch as it would enable a magistrate in the absence of a conviction to require a person who had committed no offence to give security for his good behaviour. cu es MAHON suggested that children might be maulcously apprehended under the Bill, and that it was therefore expedient to give magistrates the power of awardiUg costs to the pareuts in such cases. After some further discussion The amendment wass agreed to. Mr. HENDALL remarked thae if the security required by this clause were given by the theher, and the child afterwards lapsed into bad conduct within the 12 months the result would probably be that the father, forfeiting his recodgnoaces, would be committed to prison. In many cases this would operate very oppressively upon the parent, and also very Injuriously upon the ratepayers, since of course, if the head of the family were sent to gaol, the famly must go to the workhouse. (Hear, hear.) Mir. HENLEY also complained of the oppression which would be exercised towar;s the father if his recognizances, even thoughaamounting oly to a pound, should be estreated. A Iong and expensive process would be necessary in this case, the end of wvhich wrould probably be that, the sheriffs finding no effects, the man would be comnn itted t tohe county gaolas a debtor of the Crown, and would only be released after representations made to the authorities in london. (E[ear, hear.) Did the committee think that under such circumstances the magistrates would ever order these recognizances to be forfeited (Hear, hear.l He believed they would not, and that this provision in the clause would be a dead lettere but if not, it would ce-tainly involve a penalty upon the father (who might not be to blam in thematter), which the committee did notw a all mean to attach. (REar.) he hopedrhis honu friend (hr. Adderley) world consent to strike this proision out of the clause. Mr. HILES agreed in every word which hnd fallen fromn his right hon. friend with regard to the difficulties attending the security which was to be given for the child's good behaviour. Would it nt be betterd to d he ehild up to the parent upon a writton promise from the latter that he would take good care of him for the next 12 months, making the father liable to a fIe if the child were a second timwconvited during that periodl They would thus get rid of the difficlty attending these recognizancese Mr. BLD urged the postponement of the clause. Mr. HENLEY resedth ended his hon friend to oomit from the clause the provision requiring security to be given for the ehild's prouer car aud good behavio ur i wnig 12 month, leaving the committee to consider, upon br nging up the report, what other means could be adopted So make the parent responsible. Mlr. A DDERLEY assented, and The words objected to were struck out. hi. Serjeant O'BRIEN said, tha t the clause as it no;v stood, after the alteration just made, rendered a child liable upon a first conviction, no matter how willing the parent night be to enter into securiies, to be sent to one of these institutons whieh ceall them as you pleased, were nothing more than prisons. (Hear, hear.) Such a provision would infringe moat unnecessarily upon the liberty of the subject, and upon tho natural relation between parent and child. (Hear, hear.) A verbal promise had been made to intro. duce certain words on bringing up the report, but he thought the matter so important that the committee oaght not to be satisfied wita sen an assurance, and he suggested the postponement of the clause. (Hear, hear.) Mr. DEASY said that, as the clause now stood, a child might be brought up before the jiustices at eight years of age, and sent to one of these institutions for six or seven years, until he was 15 years old, during which period the parent would be compelled to contribute towards his support. This would be most unjust twards the parent and the remainder of the family- and most unjust towards the child so treated. (Hear.) He therefore moved the in. siertion of words limiting the term for which magtistrates might order a child to be sent to an industrial school to any period "not exceeding two years." (Hear, hear.) Mr. ADDERLEY pointed out that by the 12th clause, upon application of the parent, or other persons, the justices were empowered to discharge the child from the sohool, if satisfied that a suitable employment had been provided for him, or that there was otherwise sufficient cause. (Hoar.) This met the objection of the hon. and learned gentleman, whose amendment would bo a positive cruielty to the child as well as an injury to soCiety, for the child would then be discharged at the end of two years fthout probably a prospect of employmen.t or any provision that he would not be driven into the streets again. (Hear, hear.j MIr. BOWYER moved that the Chairman should report progress and ask leave to sit again. Clause 5, which was the foundation of the whole Bill, had been postponed; the most impoitant portion of dause 7 had also been postponed, so that they were now in fact debating upon a mere hypo- [thesis, and discussing a Bil which in reality did not exist. Lord INGESTRE opposed the motion for reporting pro. Ivess on account of the interest which was taken m the =asure out of doors. Rerjeant O'BRIEN sadd that, If the hon. member fo5 ,taffibrdshire would state that there was some security to be given by the parent upon which the child should not be sent to the reformatory, ie would not SUppOrt the motion for reporting progress. Otherwise he sheuld do so. ir. LD.DERLBY said, that that should be provided for, mnd the onlz diBculty was as to the nature of the security o beIven, IJpon that point he should like to consult with ids who were promoting the Bill. He should be lad, however, to take the sense of the House upon the mendmeat which had bee movedby the hon. and learned riember for Cork, as to whether the period of retaining the chii a the institutions should be restricted to two years or tntinued till the child reabhed the age of 15. Mr. COWPER said, that the hon. member for Staffordshire had shown such a desire to meet the wishes of hon. members that it would be rather unfair and unoourteous to pesist now in the motion for reporting progress. (Hear, hlear.) Mr. BOWYBR then withdrew his motion, and the commnittee divided upon Mr. Deasy's amendment, when the numbers were,- For the amendment ...3... ... .. 63 Againstit .X...t, - . .. ... 197 Majority .. .. .-1S The amendment was therefore lost. Mr. HENLEY suggested that the period should be limited to four years, otherwise the detention might be very lengthened when the child was admitted at an early age. Mr. ADDERLEY said, that his objection to this saugge3tio wvas the same as that which he had entertained to the amendment which the committee had just rejected. If the child could be provided for, there was ample power by the Uth clause of discharing him at any moment. Bat rather than adopt almitiwhich might result inthesechihiren being turned out uponthe streets when there was no one to receive them, and which wrould render the benefcial operation of the measure nugatory, he would throw up the Bill altogather. Mr. BARROW concurred in the views of his right hon. friend the member for Oxfordshire, and gave notice that on a future stage of the BiU he should move to limit the period at which confinement intheseinstitutions should cease to the age of 12 instead of 15. Mr. GARNETT saw no necessity for introducing any limit to the period of detention. It should be remembered that reformation rather than punishment was the object whioh they had in view. Mr. W AlHOl thought that a limit was dedrable, because not only was the period of detention of the chidren involved, but there was the further question of the expense imposed upon the parents of keeping these children in the schools. Lord LOVANE asked if the hon. and learned member meant to say that parents were not to be responsible for the support of their children, because all that the Bill said was that parents should maintain their children either in the schools or out of them? That was aU that the Bill said. Mr. GREGORY proposed to add the following pro. viso:- "Provided, however, if within the county where the child was taken into custody, or any adjoining county, there shall be any certiied iadustrial school conducted on the princiles of the religious perasion to which the parent of the child in the opinion of the justicess shaUl belong, and the managers of such school shall be willmng to receive him, such child shaUl be sent to such last-mentionedl school, an,d not to any other." hIr, ADDERLEY said. that nothing was further,from his wish than to tamper wi the religious faith of any-of the children, and he had no objection to the proposed pro. Mr. HENLEY asked whether there would be any objection to insert some limit to the distance? that the children might be sent from lthe places where they Eved9 Mr. ADDERLEY said that, if the parents wished to send the children to distant schools beyond the county or the adjoining county, he saw no objection to that being done, provided that the parents paid the expense. o Mr. HEsLEY said that, as the BiU stood, there was nothing to prevent a child apprehended in Cornwall being sent 'to Ct'mberland or Northumberland, and he should like, therefore, to have some limit introduced. Lord LOVAINE observed that in the case of vagrant children there would be a great advantage in allowing magistrates to send them to schools at a distance from the place where they happened to be apprehended. Mr. ADDERLEY agreed with the noble lord, that to define a limit beyond which the children must not be sent would be detrimental to the interests of vagrant children particularly. Mr. PALK thought a distance ought to be defined. It would be a hardship on those who were born in thinly populated districts to be sent to manufacturing districts, where these schools would be first introduced, and to be obliged to mix with a race with whom they had no feeling in common and whose language would be wholly unintelligiblo to them. (Laughter.) Hon. members might laugh, but he doabted whether a native of the wilds of Dartmoorwould be able to make himself well understood in the highly educated town of Birmingham. Mr. G. MOORE reminded the hon. member that it was to schools the children were to be sent, where the inha. bitants of his native county might, by the provisions of the Bill, be taught the EngUsh language. (" Hear," and laughter.) Lord GODERICH said that if the children were sent, as appeared from a subsequent part of the Bill, to these schools at the expense of the parents, the magistrate onght to be required to send theor to the nearest schools. The proviso moved by Mr. GREGORY was then agreed to. Mr. EHENLEY moved another proviso, to the effect that the child should be sent to the indastrial school within the county in which tho child was apprehended, or within an adjoiuing county. Mr. ADDERLEYsaid, thatthe best cheok againt sending a child to a distant school was the expense. The exMense meant to be thrown on the parent by a subsequent cMause was the expense of the childs maintenance, and not the oost of his conveyance to sohooL The committee divided, when the numbers appeared- For the proviso ... ... ... 55 ALgainst it ... ... ... ... ...200 Majority ... ... ... ... . --145 Mr. COGAN protested against the clause, on the ground that it constituted a most dangerous invasion of the law of the country and an unjustifiable interference with parental r,ghts. Mr. RIDLEY took the opportunity of again expressing his opinion that the union workhouse schools were the proper schools to which these children should be committed. Mr. LIDDELL said, there was nothing to prevent any well-organized workhouse school from being certified under the Bill. Mr. BRISCOE observed that hundreds of pauper children were educated at Anerley, in Surrey, and brought up to various trades and employments; and he concurred in the remark that it was to the workhouse schools these children should be sent. Mr. SLANEY thought the country owed a deep debt of gratitude to the hon. member for North Staffordshire for the attention bestowed on this subject, but he wished to point out the danger that might arise from the Bil-namely, that parents who were careless of their children might become doubly careless when they knew that the children they neglected would be taken care of by the paublic, and receive advantages which the children of most .,ndstrioas and careful people were scarcely able to attain. EHe therefore thought itimportant to compel the parents of the children sent to these schools to pay in some way for the support of the children. The clause was then agreed to. The 8th clause was postponed. i On clause 9, Mr. BOWYER moved that the chairman report progre. He thought the committee could not well go on with the discussion after clauses 5 and 8 had been postponed, and the very bowels taken out of clause 7. (A laugh.) The committee divided:- For reporting progress ... ... 16 Against it. ... 192 Myajority ... -176 The clause was then agreed to. On clause 10, which provides that a parent may (under conditions) have a child sent to a school which he approves, Mr. BARROW expressed his hope that such alterations would be made in the clause as would enable parents, at any time after their children had been sent to industrial schools, to apply for their transfer to other schools. Mr. HEBLEY did not see why, if magistrates determined to send children to Roman Catholic schools, and the parents wished them to be sent to Protestant schools, the parents should be muleted in the expense of transferring the children to schools where they would be educated in the religion ef their parents. After some conversation, Mr. CO WPER said, the clause as it stood gave parents the werof obcting totheirchildren being sent to a partioular ndustal school uponany grounds. Theymightconsiderthat one school was better conducted than another, and urge the removal of their children in the belief that they would obtain a better education, without any reference to religious teaching and he thout, therefore, if the clause afforded so much latitude, that the parents ought to be called upon to bear at least a portion of the expenses. Mr. HENLEY proposed that after the word " objection" the words " on other than religious grounds" be inserted. The amendment was agreed to. Mr. BOWYER moved the omission of the words " aud pays or finds good security to pay any expenses which may be incurred in consequence of his objection." The hon. and learned member was stating his reasons for proposing the amendment when At a quarter to 6 o'clock, in compliance with the standing orders, the House resumed. GRAND JUES (IRELAND) BILL.

MA2NACRMSYR ART TRBASURES Bx- HIBITION. (Continued from ne inwsas of June 1L) If Rubens may be called the embodiment of p:.- torial profuseness Rembrandt is the type of pictorial concentration. An obscwrity hangs about the life of the man not unlike the mysterious gloom which shrouds his pictures; and, as the touch of light in his compositions often falls on some hideous or misshapen thing, ao the few reliable facts in his history are most of them sad ones. Rembrandt of the Rhine is so called from his birth (1606) on the banks of tnat river, between Leydendorp and Koukerk, in the house belonging to his father's milL They stiU show a mill, with his name in gold letters over the door, but it is not the miU which Rembrandt etched, and which is usually thought to h&ve been his father's. His parents had means to send their son to Leyden for the study of the law, bat his bent to painting was declared, and he was allowed to follow it. We know the names of his maaters-Zwaanenburg, a mere ?wmiuis u6mbra, without a biography or a known work-Lastman, and Pinas, third-rate members of that large family of Dutch artista who haunted the studios of Elzheimer, Poelemburg, Sandraert, and their contemporaries at Rome; for Holland and Elanders seem to have supplied the bulk of the painters at the end of tho 16th century both to Italy and the Worth. In 1627 an accident revealed to Rembrandt, then at the Hague, the market value of hispictures. In 1628 he set up a studio in Amsterdam. In 1645 he married. In 1656 he was insolvent. In 1665 the small balance of his property was paid over to his only son Titus. How he was brought to ruin, when he died, where he is buried, are things at which his biographers have guessed, but as to which nothing is positively known. There is no record of his death or burial in any of the Amsterdam registers down to 1674, 10 years after the latest recorded date of a picture by him. One story makes him die in Stockholm i 1670, another in Hull, another in Yarmouth Quien sabe The painter lived as he painted, in shadow. His insolvency is the high lght of the picture, thanks to the Dutch law, which has preserved in the Court register of Amsterdamn the inventory of his effects. Thir inventory is the best guide we have to the way of life, tastes, and habits, of the painter. The furniture of eigrht roomns is eumuerated in it, including antechambers and entrance-halL There is a large collection of pictures by Rembrandt himself; one picture bv each of his masters, Pinas and Las-man; several by Brauwer, Hercules Seghers, Jean Lievens, and other Dutch painters;-of Italian pictures, a Palma Veechio, a Bassan, a Head and a Madonna by 3Raffaelle; a Child by Michael Angelo; and two copies after Annibal Caracci. Then there are many volumes of prints after Flemish, Dutch, and Italian masters, including Mfaro Antonio's from Raphael, and sketches and drawings. There is a reasonable allowance of Spanish chairs in leather and green velvet, a marble winecooler, and a walnut-tree table, in the front parlour; a blue suit of furniture with a bed, an oak table, a wardrobe or armoire, and a stove, in the saloon; a very feeble batterie in the kitchen, including, however, "a pewter ;" and of linenwhich the careful broker has noted as "then at the washerwoman's"-we regret to say,-including body and household, the stock is limited to three shirts, six pockethandkerchiefs, 12 napkins, three tablecloths, and "some collars and wristbands." But to make up for this scanty supply of linen there is an enormous amount of bric-&-brac, comprising globes and minerals, colun and china, busts of Roman emperors and ancient philosophers, helmets and armour, stuffed beasts, birds, and fishes; plaster-casts, including the Sibyl andthe Laocoon; walkingsticks and bamboo-pipes, musical instruments, bows and arrows, and a metal cannon; heads and hands moulded from nature, stag-horns and Indian armour, fragments of antique dresses of divers colours, halberds and swords, a wooden trumpet, and the skins of a lion and a lioness. We have enumerated this motley array of things for the light they throw on the painter's studies and tastes. He seems, judging by this authentic document, to have scorned neither the antique nor Italian art. As for the bric-dbrac, which bears as huge a disproportion to the linen and household furniture as Falstaf's sack to his bread, it seems to us to ilustrate better than words can do the character and working of Rembrandt's mind, its leaning to the strange, incongruous, and mysterious, its thirst after the play of light on quaintly carved and highly reflecting surfaces, its sense of the charm there is in tamished velvet and half-effaced gilding, its mixed relish for the fantasies of barbaric form, the glories of E:astern colour, and the severe loveliness of the antique. What is so like a picture of Rembrandt's as an old curiosity shop when twilight steeps ita multifarious wealth of trash and treasure in transparent brown, pierced only by the ray from an unencumbered pane, or deepened by the halo of a solitary lamp ? After seeing many of Rembrandt's pictures we need not be surprised to learn that his first paintingroom was a mill, and that his house in Amsterdam was a bric-a-brac warehouse. In the mill the atmosphere is one of mysterious shadow and luminous half-tone, with a pencil of concentrated light falling through the high-up window-slit, and illustratinge | the eftect of lighat upon form and colour all day long. It is not difficult to believe that this millroom and this one sunray did more for Rembrandt than a hundred Lastmans and Pinases could have done. They wrought on a mind gifted with one of the rarest and most mysterious imaginations that has ever been vouchsafed to painter-falling, by the mode of its manifestations, so far into the strange, that it is for the most part excluded from the sublime, but never failing to impress with a power quite peculiar to itself. In his earliest works there is least-not of this power, but of its fantastic operation. Such portraits as the two from the Eertford Collection (15 and 16), "Jan Pellicorn with his Son," and "Vrow Pellicorn with her Daughter," in their breadth, simplicity, and wonderful effect of naturaUy diffused light, exhibit really as complete a mastery over the magic of sun and shadow as even that awful " Noli me Tangere" (842), with i.ts ghostly Christ, and its mysterious blush of dawn, or that " Sleep of Jacob" (687), on his way from Beersheba toward Haran, when the angel bends over the sleeper with the light of heaven still shining on wings that seem yet to rustleifrom their earthward flight. In such pictures as thisRembrandt appears to be one of the greatest of all poets who have ever revealed themselves on canvas. But he speaks to us entirely through colourand light and shade-if light andshade in his hands can be distinguished from colour. All that heconveys byform and feature-through which most painters can beat express what poetry is in them-is sordid, mean, and redolent of the basest commonplace of life. What parallel can we find to this concurrence in Rembrandt of such colour and chiaroscuro with such form? There can scarce be fewer than 30 pictures of his at Manchester, displaying him as poet, as portraitist, and as landscape painter. It is difficul tto say in which track he walks most entirely apart from all other painters. There is something in the blending of g,randeur of effect with tameness of subject in his landscape, akin to the union of base form with grand chiaroscuro in his imaginative compositions. Lord Overstone's large landscape (664) is a case in point. Nothing can be flatter, duller, deader, than this expanse of fat plain, intersected by a river which all but stagnates between its muddy banks. What life one miht ask can be put by human art into such land and such water ? Rembrandt answers the question here by flashing on a span of this dead level a ray that kindles the dull fiat as a sweet smile irradiate? a still face,-there by veiling the dead reach of river under the gloom of a passing cloud. What matter levels or lines? Has he not light and shadow? VWhat flatness of land, or muddiness of water are beyond the transmutation of that alchemy? The picture (673) of I The Virgin and St. Josepha reading," with the divine infant in the cradle by their side, is one of those small and simple works in which the mere direction and force of a ray of light is made to uplift the imagination of the spectator, quite beyond criticism of the incident represented, or the personages though whom the action is carried on. You may rag, the Virgin is a Dutch field-vrouw; the St. Josepe a boor; the scene a LJower Rhenish cabin, and not a cottage in Palestine. What matter ? It is enough that we breathe in that picture an atmosphere of stilness and home content, and deep naternal joy, such as might well brood aboutthe cradle of the Saviour. How all this can be imprwssed upon the mind by the mere diffusion of window D ight roisd an ugly group of siim ng figdre inaoDutch hut i amore than criticismitan unidgule. "The Belisazzar's Feast" (695), contributed by Lord Derby, is not one of the mnastee Works QC wonder. We should have expected an infinSe. grancder treatment of the subject. The thicke4 blaekness of cloud and the most blinding brightnew of fire seem not too much that the hand. writing on the wall might burst from its con. cealing darlness upon the amazed eyes of th Assyrian King. But, instead, we have a diffuse light in the foreground, in which Belsh=a&rs pudding face and podgy figure, stripped of all glamour of transparent shadow, prolaim themselves as they are, to the destructioxi of all solemnity and awfulness. Infinitely mor, impressve is the " Daniel before Nebuchadnezzar'` (091), from Lord Scarsdale's collection, whether we class it as a work of Rembrandt's, or, with Dr. Waagen, set it down as a picture of his prupil, Solomon de Koning. E the pupil painted it, Rembrandt need not have been ashamed of the perform.- ance. The Daniel is not toougly and "fabsy" for the master. EBt a powerful imaginationhaswrolug1 in the heads of the indignant counsellors and tha chafing king. You feel that Daniel is even now im the lion's den. We seem to see-let others settla for themselves if they can see it-something leonine in the faces that scowl and the mo,ith that wrinkle fiercely, and the eyes that glouL and glow about the young prophet. Nebuchadnezzar himself seems grown a sort of idn- of the beasts. How finely fantastic, too, is that 'one gigantic pearl which, from above the throne, glows. with a weird, inward, opalescent light I The thought of that unaccountable and most fabulous. pearl is certainly worthyof Rembraudt. Rembrandts. portraits in the Manchester Exhibition are of the, first merit, in all the master's manners. For his broad and simple style, with silvery light equally diffu sed, besides the Pellicorn pair already noticed, here are the " Family Portraits" from Mr. Henry Hope's collection-a plain burgher standing in his own entrance-hall, with his wife seated nearhim. Nothing beyond soberest brown and black in the dresses, relieved by the white ruffsnothing beyond the commonest reality of a. passage-room in the background-nothing beyond the commonest citizen life in the faces and. attitudes; and yet out of this combination of coMmonplaces the painter's power has created a. masterpiece of individuality and interest. No man of any imagination could live in a room with these. portraits without building up a history of the pairone would almost say, without becoming acquainted with them, askinog questions and getting answers as. to their lives and circumstances. Here, too, is thepainter's own portrait at 36, from the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace (685), and the " Young Mlan in Turkish Costume," from Windsor (686), both fine works of the master's earlier manner. Lord Overstone's " Old Woman" (665) is the most wonderful transcript of a perfectly common place, hard-worked, little old housewife, in a mob-cap, folding her hands,-one of the pictures. which prove that every human face, truly rendered, has an ineffable charm for all who look at it. Of a. later period, and marked by greater rapidity of touch and more mastery of effect, is Lord farborough's portrait of the aged Duchess of Lorraiae(696), in which may be seen old ladyhood in decrepitude, rendered to every wrinkle about the fallen mouth, every angle and crease in the thin bonyhands. Positively startling for its modelling under strongest light, yet quite without blackness in the shadowvs, is the head of a young woman in a broac ruff (694), which once formed part of the Pourtales. collection, and is contributed to this exhibition by Mr. Charles Maud. Look as close as you will intoG this magnificent head, painters and critics, practicians and theorists-luckily it hangs at the level of the eye-who of you can tell how the effect is produced? But to say what we feel of every Rembrandt here would occupy a space for which there are but too many claimants. We pass from the master to his pupils, De Koning, F. Mol, Gerard Dow, Vander Eckhiout, and licholas Mass. But first let us point out a work of Jan Lieven's, Rembraudfscontemporary, whom, to judge by the number of his works in Rembrandt's possessisn, that painter must have admired. This is the powerful though painful "Job Tormented" (688), which most whosee it would at first sight take for a work by Rembrandt. If the " Daniel " we have already decribed be Solomon De Koning's, it is by far superior to his "Judas in the Temple " (673), or to "The Hiagar with the Angel" of F. Bol (674). Bol is seen to best advantage in the fine portrait. subject (665) contributed by Mr. T. Baring, in whichL a lady is trying the effect of an earring, or some such head trinket, at a glass, while the expectant; male sits by. From the gentleman's patience some may infer him to be the lady's lover; to us the expression appears more like marital resignation. It is a harmonious and well-composed work, marked by that yellow tone in the lights which is characteristic of this master. Philip De Koning, a brother of Solo-. mon's, was the greatest of Rembrandt's pupils im landscape. The large flat Datch subject here (from the Pourtales and Orford Collections) (703), though the pupil's sunlight somewhat lacks the glow of his master's, is a not unworthy pendant of the great representation by Rembrandt of a very similar scene already described. In Dle Koning's picture a. watery gleama falls on a town, kindling its brick walls and windmills with rare truth of effect. Gerard Dow cannot be said to be adequatelv represented in the four pictures of his here. The best of them is the young woman cleaning a saucepin, called " La Bonne Menagare" (1,075), from Her MIajestv's collection, and MIr. H. T. Hope's "1 Girl at a Window" (1,045), which are both gems as miniature representations of perfectly uninteresting objects. Of Eckhout we could have vwished for more examples than the single male portrait (688) contributed by MIr. Howard Galton. Nicholas Maas is better represented. Here are Mr. Labouchere's two fine examples of the master, " The Listener" (as favourite subject, which he repeated) (1,079) and the "Lacemaker" (1,050), Lord Ellesmere's "Girl Sewing" (1,071), and three other pictures, including a " Saint Anne teaching the Virgin to read" (657), contributed by Mr. Howard Galton, an example of that naturalistic Datch trea tment of sacred subjects which we shall have future occasion to refer to. Maas was the greatest of Rembrandt's pupilg in his mastery of chiaroscuro, but he tends to blackness and opacity where his master was al.vays transparent and brown. We may here mention one fine portrait and some inferior works of Vanden HieIst which should have careful examinati,m, though they bv no means do justice to the powers. of that manly painter. We arenow en PleibweHoUande. We stand before the works of that school which set its pupils resolutely and rigidly to work on the men and things: around them, and rather on the everyday aspectsr of both, than on the rarer incidents in whicl. men become tragic, and earth, sea, or sky beautiful or awful. The art of this school may ba the most prosaic arta that has ever existed, but it is also the most perfect art inits technical insne This technical perfection has preserved in esteem and raised enormously in money value representations of the tamest scenery and the coarsest or commonest life. The number of these masters and the amount of these works pioduced in Holland and ?landers between 1600 and 1700 is something marvellous. No race we know seem to have been soseager to possess unideal transcripts of their own shallow seas and round-quartered galliots, their own streets and churches, their own canals, polders, copses, and roads, their own sbeepand cattle and pigs, their own beerhouses and village kermesses, their own burghers and boors anc soldiers, as these Dutchmen and Flemings of thet 1'th century. So great is the multiplicity of masters, and so little is known of their lives, that. it is almost impossible to clasify them by schools_ It is doubtful, even with so great a painter at Hobbema, -whether he worked in Holland or im FlandersL Distribution into sahools is, however, less important for these works, because each of these schools was influenced by, and in its turn influenced, all the others. Perhaps the division by subjects is the least unsatisfactory; and this wa shall adopt, classing together the landscapes hera exhibited of Onyp, Hobbema, both the Ruys. daels, Van Everdingen, Lingelbach, Waterlou, Wynants, the Van de Voldes and Backhuysen, Vheger and Aart Van der Neer ; the townviews of Van der Heyden and Storch; the, low life of the younger Teniers, Brauwer, the Os. tades, Jan Steen, Schalken and Van Tilburg; ths' conversation pieces of Terburg, Metzn, Fra=n and Wi3helm Mieri, Netscher, Eglon van det Neer and Van Musacher; the battles, halts, anti skirmishes of Van der Meulen, Wouvermans, Ila Duc, and Wyc;; the cattle piees of Paul Pottebr Berghem, Dn Jardin, and Solomon Ruysdael- the interiors and exteriors of De Hooge, De Witte, ani

Tna ROYAL V1SIT TO MAicuxESTmR.-The approaching visit of Her Majesty and a portion of the Royal family, on the 30th inst., is looked forward to with intense interest by tbe loyal citizens of Manchester. It is generally felt that, as Her Majesty haa kindly promised to make a special visit to this city, at considerable inconvenience, in the midst of the fashionable season, it is but becoming on the part of the inhabitants to make their welcome the more cordial and enthusiastic. If upon the occasion of the last visit of Hler Majesty, which was a call while in the neighbourhood, the display of loyalty was great, it may weU be imagined that the formal visit about to be made will be responded to by Her Majesty's lieges in this locality in a manner at once gratifyinig to the Monarch and creditable to the subject. The arrangements for the state ceremoniaLl are not yet completed, but we are in possession of particulars which will be interesting to our readers; we therefore take the earliest possible opportunity of communicating the information we bave been able be gather. The Royal party will include (besides the Queen) the Royal Consort, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Princess Alice, Prince Alfred, and the Prince of l'russia. The illustrious visitors will be attended by Sir George Grey, as Secretary of State, the Mar. quis of Breadalbane (Lord Chamberlain, Lord Torrington. Colonel Phipps, Colonel Seymour, and the accustomed retinue of ladies-in-waiting, maids of honour, equerries, &c., in addition to a briliant aasemblage of peers and peeresses --by, in fact, all the appendages necessary to the completion of a gorgeous State pageant. The Royal party wll reach Worsley-hall on the evening of Mjlondday, the 29th inst., to which princely mansion they will prcceed by special train direct from the Royal Palace. They wil pass the night at Worsley, where they will be surrounded by the most distinguished assemblage ever colected in the county of Lancaster. It is expected that the Royal party will leave Worsley-hall for Manches. ter about 9 o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 30th inst. On the following day, when the Royal party make a private inspection of the contents of the Palace, it is belheved that the Exhibition will be reached without passing through the eity. We understand the arrangements contemplate the reading and presentation of two addresses, oae from the executive committee of the Art Treasures Exhibition, which wil be presented by the chairman, and the other from the MIayor and Cororation of Manchester, will, of course, be presented by ourchietmagistrate. Any other ad. dresses to jIor Mlajeisty will be simply presented without the formality of reading at the time. The presentatiors will take place within the Palance during the State ceremonial on the 30th inst., and no ad. diaswsa will be presented in any other place. The. inhabitants are now actively engaged in making preparations for giving a right Royal reception to Her Majesty; a general holyday on the occasion is being discussed in a favourable spirit ; and it is anticipated that the city and the townships around wil be illuminated on the night of the 30tM All who purpose being present at the State coremonial should bear in mind that admisMion to the palace on the occasion can only be smcured by the posession of twoguinea season tickets, which aue now seling rapidly. The above outline of the arrangements proposed Is tolerably accurate, but we hall be able to ie the -official tregranins before the close of the week. We oberehtteofial at the palace are actively occupied in cain Into effect the arrangements necesaruvto be made in theuilding fgr the approaching visit. *Ihe sa orchesta which has recently been ueed is shortly to be rmoved, and the large orchestra which was erected for he inauulday wi again take its place in the building.- EzancraEiem of yesterday.

; 7ONBY-M.ABKg9½idCITY !TESLLBNOEB. Wednesy Evening. The funds have been dull to-day at the prices to which they receded yesterday afternoon, and at one time there was a further slight depression. Consols for the 9th of July opened at 93 to J ex. cividend, and returned to that quotation after a period during which there were sellers at 93. The amount of general business was very small, but the majority of operations during the morning on the part of the public consisted of sales for delivery. Money was consequently still in demand a't 6 per cent., but later in the day the supply wras found to be more than adequate. The market, hovwever, at the close, exhibited no firmness of tone, the specalators having lost confidence in the prospeot of a reductioa in the rate of discount being adopted at the Bank Court to-morrow. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 2U4; Reduced, 92kto i; New Three per Cents., 92~ to {; l[ndia Bonds, 10s. to 5s. discount; and Exchequer Bonds, 98k to §. Exchequer-bills continue weak at 5s. discounlt to par. here was no particular pressre for money today either at the Bank or in the discount-market. Foreign securities have been less firm, and sales increased towards the close of business. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account were negotiated at 95f and 96i, and the Four per Cents. guaranteed at 1OIM. In Russian Five per Cents. transactions took place at 110 and 110I, and in the Four-and-aHalf per Cents. at 98 and 99. Brazilian Five per Cents., 100; Chilian Six per Cents., 102i; Granada Deferred, 61-; Mexican, for account, 221; Peruvian Three per Cents., 53q; Spanish Three per C,ents., 42k; the Newv Deferred, for money, 26i; for the account, 26i and i; and Dutch Two-and-aHlalf per Cents., 65X and i. The corn-market was firm this morning at the improved rates of Monday. The unfavourable reaction on the Paris Bourse continues. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. this evening were 68f. 50c. for money and 68f. 60c. for the end of the month, showing a further fall of between an eighth and a quarter per cent. The letters from Paris state that the stock of specie in the Bank of France is augmenting, and that an idea is entertained of reducing the premium at present offered for gold. Unless the Bank feels itself strong enough to take this step a lowering of the rate of discount will be manifestly unsound. Pending the elections which are to take place on the 22d inst. political considerations seem to wseigh upon the Bourse. Reports are again in circulation that an exposi of the nature of the claims of the rand Central Railroad on Count de Mornay, which were thought to have been settled by arbitration, is again in prospect. Even in the absence of any further immediate arrivals from Australia the available supply of specie seems likely to be sufficient for all current requirements. Some quantities of bar silver and five-frane pieces will remain over after the departure of the next China mail, the 211,0001. of gold and silver brought by La Plata on Monday has not yet been placed upon the market, and a total of 400,001. is expected by the next two Anerican steamers. The accounts from Milan regarding the progress of the silk crop are still extremely unfavourable. From Lyons, on the other hand, it appears that the improved symptoms lately reported have not experienced any check. Memorials have recently been addressed to the Government by some of the leading Chambers of Commerce in the provinces, as well as by the East India and China Associations of London and Liverpool, urgingthe expediency of every step being taken to promote tne new railway and telegraph route to India vid the Euphrates. Three months back the public were surprised by an announcement of its having transpired that Russia had long previously entered into a contract for a telegraph line towards India from Nicholaieff across the Caspian, which was suspected to be already in active progress; but, notwithstanding the popular feeling on the subject, nothing appears to have been *done to hasten the realization of a similar advantage for this country. A new prospectus has been issued of the Flax Mills Company which was introduced some time back. The proposed capital is 100,0001. in 201. shares, and the board of directors is composed of influential and experienced agriculturists. The object is to promote flax cultivation, by supplying the only want that has lately prevented it from assuming the inmportant place to which it is entitled in the national industry-namely, that of mills in suitable localities to convert the crop as harvestef by the farmer into linseed oil, oil-cake, fX fibre, and tow. The chief support of the scheme is anticipated to be obtained from the landed interest. Not more than a fourth of the capital is to be called up until experience shall have demonstrated its utility. A Parliamentary document relating to Hongkong has lately been printed, which possesses considerable interest, as it describes the exact position and prospects attained by the colony shortly before the breaking out of the war. It consists of a despatch from Sir John Bowring, enclosing a copy of the last annual report made to him by the Colonial Secretary on the progress of the island. It appears that the place has benefited not only by the increase of the Chinese trade during the past few years, but by the effects of the rebellion in promoting emigration from Canton. A consequent improvement was observable in the character of the Chinese population, and many of the natives growing in wealth had also grown in respectability. The increasing disposition to settle on the island was manifested especially among the better class of traders, and the general tendency to prosperity was further stimulated by many of the chief commercial houses in China, both British and American, having lately made Hongkong their central point of establishment. " The development of steam navigation," it is said, " the rapid extension of trading relations with Australia and California, the increase of trade on the coasts of China, the opening of Siam, and the security which the flag of Great Britain offers against piratical attacks are among the causes which have led to these results." The population, which in 1848 was only 23,998, amounted at the beginning of 1856 to 72,607. Owving to the happy fact of the absence of any Customhouse there are no means of furnishing statistical details of the imports and exports, but tbe signs of an active and rapidly increasmg trade were everywhere visible, and were corroborated by the rate of interest being as high as 36 per cent. per anmnum, although the latter circumstance is partly to be attributed to the comparatively needy condition of the small Chinese traders. The Government house had just been completed at a cost of 15,3181., and many other public improvements were in progress. Although the existing gaol buildings are pronounced tctally inadequate, it wvas only because larcenies and petty offences had increased with the influx of population, crime of the more aerious kind being rare. The impression as to the unhealthiness of the colony seems to be disappearing, and notwithstanding the large increase in the number of inhabitants the year 1855 in the town of Victoria was found very lavourable for foreigners. The Chinese consider the place not more inimical to health than the towns on the mainland. Many improvements remain to be effected which would doubtless add much to its safety, but the revenue even at its recent rate of increase would admit only of moderate undertakings. To meet al requirements the Colonial Secretary revived a suggestion for the imposition " of a differential duty of-say, Id. per lb. on teas sbipped for England from Hongkong." Sir John Bowring, however, in harmony with the view now universally e6tablished among commerial men, declined to smpport the recommendation.

LONDON, THUMDAY, JUNE 18,1857. The House of Oa,mmons yesterday, in committee, vent ito the detais of the Registration of Long Leases TScotland) Bill and of the Industrial Schools Bill. lhe clauses of the formner were agre4d to; but while the 9th clauae of the latter Bill was uxdcer discu-sion the Houzs reummd. Certain Bills were advanced a stage. The other orders having been disposed of without discussion, the House adjourned at 10 minutes to 6 o'clock.
The dismal history of WkAs's foray into Nicaragua has at length been brought to a termination. For about two years and a-half this bandit and his followers have carried fire and sword into the midst of a population which, as far as they and the country they represented were concerned, had been guilty of no offence. The Nicaraguans were weak, ill-governed, contemptible enough in the scale of nations, and therefore surely destined one day or another to fall before some stronger Power; but at least there was no reason why they should be exposed to the fruitless atrocities of a brigand such as this man. Of what avail has it been in any political sense that so many thousands of human beings have been slaughtered, so many homesteads fired and levelled with the ground, so many women given up to the brutal licentiousness of WALnan's armed rabble, so many towns-and among them the notable city of Granada-totally destroyed ? All this misery has been inflicted without just cause-all this suffering has remained without any result. Wars must be. The human race has made great progress in science, in mechanical processes, in knowledge of all kinds, in general civilization, but we have not yet got rid of the last dire arbitrament of the battle-field. The chronicles of the last 42 years are fresh in the minds of all, and how many of those 42 years have not been mainly illustrated or ensanguined with the military achievements of one nation or another ? It has been the fashion to speak of 40 years at least of this period as years of peace-but what peace ! Now the Spanish and now the Italian Peninsula has been red with the blood of contending armies; now the Turkish fleet has been sunk beneath the quiet waters of Navarin ; and now the Russian hordes have perished like flies in the autumn time, as with ever diminishing strength they staggered on to the diplomatio haven of Adrianople. At one time the cause of "liberty," at another that of " order," has been effectually vindicated at Paris, as the red gutters of the time could show; at another "tran"quillity," that Russian idol, was enthroned at Warsaw in a very solemn way. The smoke of the opposing cannon has scarcely yet curled away from off the wide Hungarian swamps. Need we speak of England's share in these peaceful transactions.? The North-Western Provinces of India, the banks of the Indus and of the Irrawaddy, have been the witnesses of our military glory. The fleets and armies of this country have already dealt one downright blow at the power of the Tartar dynasty in China, and even now the sword of England is bared, and about to fall in the same quarter with sharper effect. The story of that great contest which was waged in the Crimea may be passed over with but a passing remark, for that is generally admitted to be a stern parenthesis in the loving records of the nineteenth century. The French, however, for 25 years of that t. e have been steadily occupied in pursuing the African hordes from one mountain pass to another, while at the other extremity of that great continent we ourselves have waged two conte,ts of extermination amid the bush of Caffreland. So far of the peaceful history of the Old World. In the New, peace can scarcely be said to have reigned during the piping times of that murderous miser FRsciA in Paraguay; nor precisely along the course and at the mouth of the River Plate; nor among the Republics on the Pacific seaboard of South America; nor in Mexico, where of late the sturdy pioneers of the Northern States drove before them the hybrid population of that lovely region, pretty much as of old the steel-clad followers of CorTEZ swept before them the Indian hosts as the wind might have swept away the feathers with which they were adorned. It is idle to talk of peace in the past, and a dream to reckon upon it in the future. Let the best and wisest of manldnd struggie as they may, we must still look forward to war as to a probable contingency. It is a frightful evil, but we shall gain nothing by ignoring the fact. One thing, however, it would not be unreasonable to expect. Since wars must be, at least let them be the wars of great States ;-let them be conducted in the most efficient manner possible, but at least under the direction of statesmen who will not inflict evil for evil's sake, and of officers who will do their duty, but do no more. Let uB not have such bootless carnage, such frightful desecration of the humanities of life, as haa lately been witnessed in Nicaragua. Disputants given to paradox have dilated on the ilustration of ALExAnDn and the Robber. Now, A xA"NER was a great fact, and the Robber a little one; why not have hung him quietly out of the way ? It is much to be regretted that such a fate has not overtaken General WTTTIAM WALKMZ, who, in place of finding that appropriate termination to his career, was admitted to the honours of a capitulation at Rivas, and is now enjoying the adulation of his partisans and admirers at New Orleans. There can be no doubt that had not Commander DAVIS, of the United States' sloop of war St. Mary's, appeared in the allied camp, and negotiated the articles of this instrunent, WALKER, and as many of his followers as remained, were perilously near a most ignominious termination to their career, unless their own despair had anticipated the ultimate event. It is no business of ours to criticize this interference on the part of the United States, but at least we may express our regret that throughout the whole contest they should have given to WALKER's enterprise just that kdnd of half-sanction and half-countenance which he required. Even at the last, had it not been for an impolitic dispute in which the Filibuster engaged with Messrs. VAN_ DERBILT, it is more than probable that he would either have afflicted the country by his presence for a longer time, or at least that he 'would have made his escape laden with its spoils. The plunder of Granada, by all accounts, was no inconsiderable matter. In recent numbers of the Panama Star which have just reached us we have an accoumt of the systematic manner in which the destruction was conducted. On the 21st of November last WAIKER caused his followers-about 800 in number-to be paraded, when they were, under his authority, thus addressed by an officer :-" Fellow soldiers, "his Excellency WILLIAM WVALKnR is fully aware of the fact that for the last eight months you " have not received one dollar in cash for your long and faithful service, and he deeply regrets "that the commercial community have not yet dis"covered the value of his Treasury bonds. The "advance of those d- rebels from San Salvador, "Honduras, and Guatemala, in overwhelning "numbers, renders it necessary for us to evacuate Granada, and, since we cannot enjoy it, he is "determined they sball not." Every house and church was to be burnt, WAIaRn reserving to himself the plunder of the churches. Well was the ruthless mandate obeyed by the scoundrels who were told off to execute the accustomed work in symmetrical form. Eight churches, desciibed as " magnificent," were plundered and destroyed. All else that could be burnt, from the more solid houses of the wealthier inhabitants to the cane huts of the Indians, was committed to the flames. Let any one imagine all that ha has read of in the disastrous history of a town taken by storm, when the passions of a brutal soldiery, mad with combat and drink, have reigned triumphant for a while, and he will have a picture of the condition of Granada on that unhappy day. Forty-eight church bells, many of which were sad to be half silver, and a great store of gold and silver orna3nents, constituted a portion of the spoil peculiarly grateful to the chivalric feelings of the commander. The capture of the steamers by the Costa Ricans has defeated this little project of the President's for making provision against siclness and old age. The question after all this useless bloodshed aud plunder, is, will the practice of " Fii" bustering" any longer receive the countenance or American statesmen? It is no business of ours to encourage the more fervid politicians of Washington in their dreams of aggrandizement and ambition. They would, however, do less to injure the character of their country in the eyes of the civilized world were they once and again to swoop down, with or without cause, upon any particular province which it might suit their purpose to seize, than by anyfurthertoleration of this atrocious brigandage, which is called " Filibusterism." If they have but patience to await the course of events, they wil find Time a more efficient ally than WILLTASI WAT,BEn in any designs they may have upon Central America. It will fall to them soon enough. Why, then, commit a crime today to gain that which to-morrow, without a crime, wiU be your own ? We do not, however, aim at the lofty ethical tone of the Peace Congress in such matters. We know that war must and will be, and that the only security against it is to be prepared for the event. Let the United States make war and conquer if they can find a cause and are prepared to face the responsibility; but it is a disgrace to any nation which is chary of its fair fame to constitute itself the patron-even the unavowed patron-of such bandits as these Filibusters and their chief.
The second reading of the Ministers' Money Bill wiU come on in the House of Lords to-night, and Lord DEiRBY has given notice of his intention to move that the Bil be read a second time this day six months. For the first time since the meeting of the new Parliament the Opposition leader will be found marshaUing his forces in array against the Government. The Peers will, no doubt, listen to an excellent speech, which might wel have been made at a better season and in a better cause; for on what grounds wil the smoothness of this promising session be disturbed, and a victorious Ministry be bearded within a few weeks of their triumph ? Simply to retain for a few Irish clergymen the legal right to money which there is no chance of their ever getting. No dispossessed Celtic landowner of two centuries since, no Royalist French refugee whose domains had been split up into ten-acre patches and sold half-a-dozen times over under the Republic and Empire, was ever more completely without a chance of recovering his property than the few established clergy concerned are of obtaining their dues from the defaulting corporations. The history of the tax extends over a space of nearly two hundred years. The impost was first established by Act of Parliament in the reign of CHARlEs II., upon Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Drogheda, and Clonmel-all towns which are now inhabited by a largely preponderating population of Roman Catholics. The consequence is that now the payment is resisted, and cannot be enforced without litigation and all the many bitternesses to which it gives rise. The Protestants, of course, charge the Papists with dishonesty, with factiousness, with withholding what they covenanted to pay when they took the property on which the tax is levied; and the Papists reply with accusations of extortion, tyranny, and clerical greediness. That there may be much stinginess and much spite mingled with the opposition of the Catholics we can well believe; the rivalries of a provincial town and the tenacity of a business man's pocket may have much to do with the religious scruples which are so ostentatiously paraded. But it is the same in all these cases. As long as there is an appearance of injustice we must be prepared to find selfishness, vanity, and ambition making capital out of their opposition. The best thing is to remove all causes of discontent, real or affected. In this case the course is easy. The Ministes' Money is an anomalous impost which presses on certain localities preeminently Catholic, and does not extend to others where Protestants are in a majority. Cork pays, and not Belfast; Limerick pays, and not Enniskldlen. The tax was imDosed by an old Act of Parliament to supply a present want and encourage a Protestant immigration. It was in its nature partial and temporary. Circumstances have sincs entirely changed, and it is time that the enactment should be at once repealed. The loss to the Protestants will be little indeed, for the tax amounts only to a few thousands a-year, and, small as it is, it is to a great extent unpaid. What objection there can be to a settlement which should remove this petty grievance by foregoing this miserable benefit we cannot see. The second reading of the Bill was carried in the House of Commons by 313 votes to 174, or by a majority of 139, being only one less than the majority for the Oaths Bill. Thus these two semi-religious measures-one for the relief of Catholics, and the other for the relief of Jews-have been endorsed in the first session of a new Parliament by larger majorities than have generally been met with in late years. The example ought not to be lost on the Lords, who continually declare their respect for the representatives of the people. But there is a difference between the Billsnamely, that one affects the rights of a weak and yielding race, whose claims may be delayed or rejected with impunity, while the other relates to a pushing, turbulent, obstinate body of religionists, [who may at any time plunge half the towns of Ireland into confusion, and sound from hundreds of platforms and newspapers a yell of defiance. As a matter of peace and quietness, therefore, we think 'hat the Lords may well pause before they reject this Bill, which has been sent up to them with the approbation of so strong a majority of the Commons. As it is, in Cork and other towns there is certain to be a steady resistance to the payment of Mlinisters' Money. What, then, may we expect when Ireland learns that a Bill for the abolition of the impost has been thrown out by the Lords, after receiving the assent of a great majority of the Lower House? With what joy will each priestly firebrand receive the intelligence I With wha. interest will the agitator, whose occupation ha been of late years at an end, watch the sleeping embers of discontent once more emit a warning light 1 Every resource of cunning and pertinacity will be used to make the payment of Ministers' Money into a staudard grievance. We shall have martyrs in aU the towns -which are liable to the impost. Every corporation and every freeman who bas hitherto paid will now refuse to pay, except under legal compulsion, and any proceedings against them will be the signal for meetings, processions, banners, speeches, and all the machinery of agitation. The ministers whom it is proposed to protect get very little of their money as it is, but now they will get positively nothing. A perverse decision in the Lords will be the greatest blow to those whom the noble House is most anxious to serve. The fact is that the Conservative party bind up this question with the supremacy of the Irish Church. To apply the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commission to uses for which a tax on property has been heretofore available seems like a surrender of the principle that the people in general may be rated for the support of an Established Church. And, in truth, the Irish Church is so strange and anomalous an institution that it is difficult to say what will or what will not hurt it. It is quite possible that the extinction of an impost which extorts a few shillings yearly from each of a number of noisy and pugnacious householdera may have a dangerous effect on an establishment which is a contradiction to most rules. Bat, if the Irish Church be founded on any principle of justice or common sense, we should think that the passing of this measure can only be of service to it. The Bill removes the last of those payments which tend to aggravate and envenom the differences of creed. Church-rates and tithes have been legislated for long since, and the settlement of these questions has resulted, after a necessary interval, in the diffusion of goodwill among people who were before separated by immemorial hatreds. This little measure about Ministers' Money is but the pendant to the great changes of a quarter of a century ago. In those days the Lords showed an equal unwillingness to acquiesce in principles which a0e now universally admitted, and their opposition caused in the end more harm than good to the class they protected. We trust they will in the present case abstain from giving the Catholics a specious grievance while they seek to preserve to the Protestants a phantom benefit. Far better 'will it be that ten times the value of the Ministers' Money be lost to the Irish Church than that a field should be given for the renewal of the old bickerings and the old recriminations. Lord DaaBY will indeed be unfortunate if his plan of campaign for the session involves only attacks on such points as the Oaths Bill and the Miiisters' Money Bill. Every one feels that these are measures on which political rivalry might be content to sleep, and by passing which both sides might join to settle questions which have occupied the time and tried the patience of almost a generation of legislators.
Mr. AYRTON has lost no time in stating the grievances of the East-end Ratepayers,-with more haste than speed. The case he made out on Tuesday night is as short of the whole truth as the remedy he proposes is of the desired success. Excepting that inquiry commits to nothing, one cannot help suspecting that Mr. AYvToN had no wish to carry his motion, and would himself recoil from the measure that would have been the legitimate consequence of his speech. The more a man knows about the Poor Iaws the more he is dissatisfied with their gross inequalities, and at the same time the more hopeless of a remedy. Nobody has yet stopped at that half-way house, the Union, or the Metropolitan Rate; yet nobody has failed to discover that the next stage,aNationalRate, is a red uctio ad abmurdum of the whole enterprise. It is not everybody who acknowledges the failure, for it is the more common habit of mankind to sit down, fold their arms, and shut their mouths, when they find they have run out a political or a social theory. But if anything can be inferred from the silence of statesmen, from the utter abandonment of attempts, the failure of promises, the forfeiture of pledges, and the surrender of cherished hopes, the scheme of rectifying, widening, and equaliziug the system of Poor Law management and rating is as hopeless as tile attempt to take a ship in at Baflin's Bay and out at Behring's Straits. We are not conscious of overstating the fact when we express our belief that every one of the statesmen and economists who originated or promoted or prominently defended the New Poor Law has earnestly desired a change of rating and management in the direction of Mr. AYRTON'S motion, only further and more comprehensive, and even regarded such a change as a proper sequel and complement of the New Poor Law, but has eventuaUy been obliged to give it up, and so far admit the New Poor Law to be incomplete and onesided. After a long pause the work of completion was resumed some years ag,o in the shape of the measure making the poor irremovable after five years' residence without relief; and no doubt the principle of that measure was to destroy settlement, and to make the poor relievable on the spot, being so far in the direction of national management. This measure passed easily enough, for it was humane, and the country gentlemen, at least, had nothing to say against it. But there, again, the question rested; and at this moment the inequalities of rating are greater than ever, and still on the increase. Indeed, the strongest objection to Mr. AY'RToN's proposal is that they are as great in the country as in the metropolis,-that the evil is, in fact, too universal for cure. But, Hf the economists have had to give up the project of a more comprehensive rating area, the "ratepayers" are not likely to do more with it. This is not exclusively, or even chiefly, a ratepayer's question; it is a poor man's question and a landlord's question, besides having important bearings on the whole of our political system. Are rates taken into account in every arrangement between tenant and landlord, so that the more rate the less rent ? But every pound of rate saves more than a pound of rent, from the unpopularity of high-rated districts. Taking rent and rates together, you may get a house of given capacity at much less annual cost in a pauperized, high-rated parish, than in one under more agreeable circumstances. In these districts, too, the ratepayers are more generally yearly tenants; and the result of reducing the rates would be simply to produce a more than corresponding rise of rents, and present so much money to the landlords. There are, too, in these districts many very extensive works now heavily rated, and not unjustly, as the rates are for the relief of the classes on whose labour they depend. It is enough that Mr. AxYwrow does not introduce them, except for the purpose of an argument subversive of his case altogether. The proprietors of these works, he says, and the employers of the surrounding population, reside in the more fashionable and lighter-rated districts of the West-end, so that no injustice wil be done by making them pay a higher rate for their residences. Butt, if no injustice will then be done, neither will justice; for, on Mr. AYvToNoxs supposition, they will still pay what they ought to pay, neither less nor more. On the supposition of the West-end residents being Eastend employers, it cannot signify to them where they pay rates. The supposition, indeed, is very short of the whole truth, and, as far as it is so, Mfr. AYRToN's argument falls short of any conclusion whatever. By this time it is almost a paradox, but nevertheles a truth, that the present state of thingbas a great deal to say for itself. This, indeed, is going beyond Mr. BouvmmIs, who mainly miatiss. on the impossibility of devising a substitute, taldng credit to himself and his predecessors for having made the attempt. The present state of things is a rough approximation to the very best ideal of a Poor Law,-the industrial settlement. 'Though in very many instances the workman is in one parish and the work in another, and though there are many thousands of workmen who go wherever the work goes, neither of them having any fixed locality, yet the very first complaint made by Mr. AYBToN is that the East end of the metropolis is, in the main, the seat of industry, and the West end the favoured region of wealth, enjoyment, and fashion. Indeed, in order to make his argument all straight, he is obliged to assume that the employer is at the West and the men he employs at the East. But the best security for the relief of the poor is not the dwellinghouse of the employer, which may be anywhere, or his haunts of amusement, but his manufactory, his mill, his office, his warehouse, his shipyard, or whatever the place where his men are employed and his money made. The men will not be very far off, and, as rates are not very easily collected from the poor, the charge will fall where it ought to fallon the plant and stock of the master. It iD so, in fact, with the greater part of the i-nhabitants of the West-end. They contribute largely to the relief of the poor, not only perhaps in London, but much more at the places whence their income is derived. The occupant of a house in Belgrave-square may not pay so large a poor-rate for it as Mrr. AYRToN's constituents may thinL- he ought to do, but if his income is 5,0001. a-year he is almost sure to pay through his farmers or other tenants between 5001. and 1,0001. to the relief of the poor on his estate, or at his mines, or other works. That, in fact, is the East-end to which he contributes; and Mr. AYRToN's scheme would saddle him with another, which has no claim upon him. ITor is this the only practical consideration for the present system, with all its confessed and almost indefensible anomalies. When the working classes, as in Mr. AynToN's supposition, reside 'very much together-that is, in the neighbourhood of their employment,-and when the rate is levied on the houses and on the shops and other buildings that minister to their wants and depend on their prosperity, the industrial community becomes what it ought to be-selfsupporting. That is the best system for ordinary purposes. The expense of relief is diffused over the community, and falls ultimately on the rate of wages, thus ente-ing into the cost of production. On the other hand, an industrial community living round the seat of its own labour, but largely maintained by wealthy persons accidentally living a few miles off, but otherwise having nothing to do with it, would soon find itself paid by one class and working for another-a process inevitably ruinous to all parties. The ratepayers who have instructed Mr. AmoToN, and who complain so loudly that their rates are heavier than they have been, or heavier than elsewhere, would not be at this trouble if they were relieving their poor at the cost of West-enders, nor would they take equal pains to keep that cost within reasonable bounds. It is, unhappily, found in thismetropolis already that whenever the parish or union is a large one, and comprises both poor and rich districts, the management is apt to fall into the hands of a very second-rate class, who play into one another's hands at the cost of the richer, but less united, less businesslike, and less unscrupulous class above them. It is so already in several parishes that might be named. What would it be if the East-end and the suburbs had all the property of the metropolis, all the great national and commercial establisments, and the residences of our great proprietary to draw upon ? Mr. AYRTON himself must admit the result. If he wishes to improve on the existing state of things he must do more than erect a grand Metropolitan Union, and he must raise his cause into something better than a mere ratepayer's grievance.

THE AUSTRALiAN AND NoiTH AnnicA MA T. -LIvF-RsooL, Wednesday. -Three fine screw steamers, of the collective burden of 8,C00 tons, have taken their departure from the Mersey this afternoon. The first to leave the port was the Montreal Ocean Company's steamer Indian, Captain Jones, boand to Qulebec and Montreal, with the usual fortnigbtly mails for British A merica and 375 passengera The Liverpool and New York Steamship Company's vessel the City oi Baitimore. Captain Leitch, followved at 3 10 p.m., conveying to New York 422 passengers and a ship mail for the United States. At 4 o'clock the Cumard Comnpany's sorew steamer Emeu, Captain SmalL started direct for Melbourne with 22 cabin passengers and a very heavy mail for Australia, consisting of 504 boxes, being the usuai monthly mails for the Antipodes. The Emeu is chartered by the European and Australian Royal Mall Comnany to supply the place of the Oneida between Melbourne and Suez; the latter ve8sel being now on her passage to this country to repair damage to machinery which she sustained in the Indian Ocean in January last. EXAMIINATION FOR THE MBncRCAr MARM-E.- A circular has been issued by the Marine Department of the Board of Trade to the various local Marine Boards in the united kingdom, relative to the examination of maste-s and mates in the merchant service. This circular, after referring to regulations made in 1851, states that the only additions which have been made since are that masters are now examined as to the law of the tides; mates are required to be 19 years of age instead of 18, and to flid the losgitude by the chronometer; and second mates a-e requiredtohave a knovvledge of logarithms. The circular then states that there is no desire to raise the existing standard, buit remarks are made upon the different systems of examination adopted at some ports, and rnles are laid down for the purpose of insuring uniformity.

CoxwELs'g BALLoox.-Az -anouncad in The Times of yesterday, the baUoon which ascended from the Pavilion Gardens, North Woolwich, on Mlonday night at 1130, descended safely on Tuesday morning about three miles beyond Tavistock, Devonshire, having traversed 250 nsiles in five hours. Mr. Coxwell was accompanied by Mr. John Allan and Mdr. Youens. About 1 o'clock on Tuesday morning Mr. Coxwell expressed his belief to his fellow-travellers that although the balloon was approaching the coast it was onlyina skirtingdirection, and suchappeared to bethe fact, as it was afterwards ascertained that at that time it was over Dorcbester. As daylight broke the party found themselves hugginz the coast, and were going along at considerable speed. The River Exe was crossed over, and Starcross station between Exeter and Ermouth. Dartmoor was traversed near the Prison, when Mr. Comwell, finding that a fresh wind prevailed in the lower current, determined to avail himself of the shelter afforded by the hills, and descended in a valley about three miles from Tavistodc, where a meadow presented a good landing place. BRENTwoOD GBAmsAR StnooL.-Oa Tuesday, the 16th inst., the tercentenary anniversary of the foundation and endowment of this school, by Mr. Serjeant Antony Browne, in the reign of Philip and Mary, was celebrated. After the usual speeches had been delivered by the boys, and the prizes consequent on the result of the annual examination of the whole school had been distributed, a dinner was served to the boys and their ant the head master's friends, in two tents erected for the purpose in the playgpound. The patron, Mr. Tower, of Weald-hall, took occasion to eongratulate the head master, the lev. W D West, on the success which had attended his exertions in the conduzct of tne school, and referred particularly to the election, within the last few weeks, of three boys from this Echool to scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge.

IRELAND. hmoM Oflnr AW. f ' DUBLIN, WEDCXRSDY MoREsyg. TEINITY COWhEG}. The movement in the direction of an enlarged sytem of education for the middle classes now under -the cossideration of the two great Engish Universities bas been very favourably received at this side of the Channel, and there seems to be but one opinion as to the vast benefit which may be anticipated from the proposed plan should it be carried into effect. In the event of its operations being extended to Ireland, the Irish lUniversity would experience no difficulty in furnishing an efficient staff of examiners for the outdoor middle classes, and it is suggested that an opportunity would thus be afforded to the Board of Trinity College to provide more liberally for those Junior Fellows who are not tutors, and whose narrow incomes might be augmented out of the fees received from the candidates for associate degrees or certificates. THE IRISH COURT. A Waterford paper (the Mail), while condemning the motion for the abolition of the Irish Viceroyalty, draws the following terse sketch of the whole amount of benefit conferred upon the country by the retention of the solemn mockery of an Iish Court:- As regards the thing itself the people themselves arR purely indifferent. Once in the year the Iord-Lieutenant visits one of the provinces, and gets up a stir, and is feasted and flattered at an agrimcltnral dinner, and for the time the office is popular in the locality,where there is a ball for the ladies, and where the gentlemen for ono in theirlife rub their skdrts to quality, and where the shopkeepers get a share of the spoil and the money is spent pretty freely for a fortnight. Al the year round the office is popular In Dublin. Money is spent and jobs are perpetrated, and upstarts elbow their way into places where they have no business, and other impudent people, who have no better pretension than themselves, snub them fortheir snobbery. The Lord-Lieutenant himself enacts Royalty, and sometimes fancies himself almost a King, and gets prised and abused 'by rival factions, according to his own behaviour, or aecordIng tothe opinions of those who have their own selfish ends in view." Lord Carlisle was present yesterday at the halfyearly examination of teachers in training at the National Schools in Marlborough-street, ancd at the close of the proceedings his Excellency addreised the asembled teachers in a brief but graceful speech, in the course of which he offered this practical suggestion:- sc I am happy to see among you who now sit before me, as wel as among those who are gathered behind me, members of different religious persuasions. Now, I trust I should be the very last person to call upon you to undervalue the importanco of your different religious convictions; but I think you will yourselves have been able to ascertain dunng your sojourn here howv much good and worth there may be among the members of different persuasions (applause); and you will have derived no better lesson herethan if in your futur lives you incnlcate those results of your own happy experience upon those who will be placed under your charge. Inulcate upon them the love of learning, for at iS your special minsion as schoolmasters; inculcate upon them the lOVe of God, for that is your foremost daty as Christian men; and, assa branch, a mai branch, of t'hat love and the measure of your own experience here, inculcate upon them the love of oneanotber, and may the blessng of the .Almighty be alays with you I (Applause.)" LECTURES ON TfiE WAR. Mr. W. H. Russull, the historian of the late war, made his dibu as a lecturer in his native city (Dublin) on Tuesday evening. The Theatre Royal was the scene ef his new triumph, and one of the most brilliant audiences ever congregated in that building was, perhaps, the most marked compliment that could be paid to the gentleman who has added another bright name to the list of Irishmen who bave won lasting renown in the field of literature. The following critique is condensed from the Preeman of this moruing:- " Last evening Mr. W. H. Russell, the celebrated 'spe. cal correspondent' of The Timecs during the Crimean war, delivered at the Theatre Royal the first portion of his personal narrative of the leading events of that memorable campaign. The audience which aseembled to hear our gifted countryman wvas exceedinglynumerous. The pit was densely crowded, the dress circlepresentedabrilliant array offashion, and the upper tier of boxes and the middle gaUery *ere well filLed. When hr. Russell made his appearance on the stage he was greeted with the most cordial and enthusiastic appluse, which was again and again repeated. He commenced his lecture by asking the forbearance of his audience on account of the magnitude and diffioulty of the task he had undertaken, stating that it was his intention merely to describe the impression made uPon his individual senses by the scenes which he had witnessed, without dogmatically claiming infallibility for his own views. The first portion of the lecture, which was divided into two parts, comprised his own personal experiences and the principal events of the campaign from the departure of the British Exnedition from Marseilles down to the arrival of the aliea armies on the shores of the Crimea. The narrative was remarkably lucid and aninmated, abounding with shrewd and forcible reflections. quaint touches of humour, lively salies of wit, and dcescriptive passages of the most brilliant character. The entire of the second part of the lecture was devoted to an account of this great struggle and the events by which it was immediately preceded. This wvas a master. piece of narration-impressive, graphic, picturesque, and. glowing. The positions of the various divisions of tho allied armies and of the enemy were stated with great precision and pointed out on the map, so that the audience was enabled to follow the lecturer with ease in his recital of the engagement. Nothing coald be more vivid or thrilling than his descriptions of the gaUant achievements of the Second and Light Divisions-of the last rally made by the enemy-of the final advance of the Guards and Highlanders--and of the close and deadly conflict which terminated in a glorious but dearly-purchased victory. Familiar as these incidents were to Mr. Russell's hearers, they derived new charms and additional interest from the ski7lul and eloquent style in which he presented them. The audience listened with the deepest attention as he procoeded with his glowing narrative, whbich occasionally rose into st-rains of poetic fervour and beaulty, and at the conclusion expressed their feelings of admirtion by a load and prolonged burst of applause. It will be seen from what we bavestated that Mr. Russell's introductory lecture was eminently successful and fully equal to his great reputation."
TRUSTEES' RELIEF. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TINES. Sir,-Lord St. Leonards proposed to enact that where a trustee acts under the advice of a Qneen's counsel he shall not be responsibie for the consequences of so acting. NRow. if the opinion of the Queen's counsel be correct, the trustee is safe without the enactment. Therefore it means that where a Queen's counsel gives a wrong opinion, aud the trustee, relying on the opinion as being correct, commits a breach of trast by following it, the incorrectness of the opinion shall be its great value. If I could boast of a deep insight into the mysteries of equity as it is administered in the Court of Chancery and the House of Lords, I inight be able to ascertain the eqaity of this style of legislation; bat to an humble looker-on like myself Lord St. Leonard's course of legislation seems of a very questionable character. He takes it for grante d (in fact, it is the basis of bis proposed enaotment) that Queen's counsel wil give bad advice to confiding trustees; and by a process of logic which must be peculiar to the Chancery practitioners he comes to the strange conclusion that the only person who is to suffer by the wrong-doing is the poor, innocent, helpless "cestut-q'e trust t" Suely. Sir, nataral equity would seem to point out the erring Queen's counsel as the one on whose shoulders the loss ought to fall! But why should the leamned lord stop at Queen's counsel? Have they a monopoly of giving wrong opinions? Or are they the only men at the bar who go honestlywrong 1 It is not til all the misobief is done that the value of the bad opinion is to be ascertained. What is to bs the fate of a poor trustee who confided in the opnion of a gentleman whose gown was made of stuffs Is he to cal on him, when it is found that 20,0001. have been lost in consequence of the badness of his opinion, to "take silk," in order (like a Scotch marriage) to give that ststus to the offspring of his brain which is to make it as available for the protectiQn of the trustee as a decision in his favour by the House of Lords! I have hither'o been under the impression that one of the best reasons for relying on counsel's opinion was that on the accuracy of their opinions depended, to a great exteut, their professional success; and that a barrister, whether his gown were of stuff or of silk, whose opinions were known to be frequently incorrect, would soon cease to be generally: coasulted for the guidance of trustees. Imust have been wrong, for so great a lawyer as Lord St Leonards could not propose an Act to give to an ignorant orcareless Queen's counsel a preference over the-most learned, painstukzing, and conscientious junior; and I 2nuct be equally wrong in fancying that such an Act would bpen a new door to fraud. If any lavv lord of less authority than the only man whom the country has yet known to have been Lord Chan. cellor in both Irsland and England bad proposed such an enactment, I ,hould have thought that it might have offered a temptation to au UnsCrupulous man to get thu whitewas'!`ng opinion of a Queens counsel whose. only hope o£f teting his oWn living rested on: the fact that but for the, Act his opinions would be absolutely Initrust. woeirgt, while thrsugh tbe operation of the Act the would be all the bftter the. wn- +1-h. 41me ]CQ Yours obedieutly, Ui. -Z.
-THE .1ANDEL FESTIVAT, AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE. 'The second of ~ these great consxaenioration festi- "Vals was given yesterday in the prtesence of Her lkIa&eaty, with a grandeur and suecesa which left 1ot0hing to be wished for either ou the part of its zpromoters or the public. There was no hitch 'either by rail or road, no apologies or excuses at the eleventh hour; even the wearhvr was favourable, -dnd the arrangements both within anid with-out the building were perfect an.l thoroughly carried into effect. From first to last there occurred mothing which could detract fr',m the eBtat of the ,day, or lessen its claim to be considered as one which xMust ever form a conspicuous era in our musical 4annals. The anxiety of the general public to be present 'on the occasion when Eler Majesty honoured the jfte with what may be called a State visit showed itself in the neighbourhood of the Palace at a very -early hour. Probably long before even the most impatientJvisitors thought of starting, the turns in the road which would command a good view of the Royal cort-ge were occupied three or four deep. 'These spectators, too, were by no mieans of the ordinary class, but ladies and gentlemen whom one *vould rather have expected to meet in the galleries -of the palace itself. As the day advainced the num'bers increased, till the pretty lanies and woods 'oetween Dulwich and the building were completely lined. As usual most of these lookers-on were of -the gentler sex, and their bright dres&es and waving parasols seemed in the distance to make a glowing lower border to the fields and groups of trees around 'which they stood. Though all were naturally 4anxious to secure the most favourahle situations, 'there was none of that unseemly struggling which eo often nmars our gayest flfes. it ass in fact a kind of rural " drawing room," where ladies could 't)ow to Her Majesty en passant without incurring ' the aristocratic discomforts which generally attach such presentations. There were a good imany, also, of the public holyday observances -about the road yesterday. Before the carriages began to pass itineraut vendors of all sorts of commodities made their appearance, and were mnore or less attentive to every one e,, route to the Palace throughout the day. Apart from the wonrderful combination of wind anid water which, =nder the name of ginger-beer, was pressed -upon the occupant of every carriage, the notion seemed generaUly to prevail among the hawkers 1hat none could attend the festival without a pocket-knife, a walkingstick, a cocoanut, a basket of oranges, and a copy of each of the morning journals. Such trifles, with side-combs, complete songsters, and villainous programmes unknown to Eandel, were pressed upon all, with interludes of email bills thrown in at the carriage windows, inlEorming their hot occupants that now was the 'time for cheap greatcoats and woollen dread- noughts. Soon after 10 the carriages began to roll -along the road, and from that time, except during the short interval when Her Alajesty waspassing, Ihey did not entirely cease until past 2 in the day. 'The arrangements at the abominable tollgate were ibetteron this occasion-three persons were stationed to collect its heavy revenue, and, generally speaking, were equal to the duty, which, however, at no time was a sinecure. The trains from London-bridge commenced running early, and the working plana at the station were tsogoodandsowell adhered to that, even whenthe influx was greatest, allwereeasilyandrapidlydespatched -to their destination. There was an unusual number of half-gufinea visitors-indeed, all the extra seats allotted to them were among the first.occupied, so that many were glad to change their tickets for the reserved places. The great mass, of course, settled down at the south end of the bumilding, facing the Queen's box, where a complete view could be obtained of all the Royal party. These were the places first fiUed, and it was interesting to watch the gradual filliDg up of the remaining space,-how, minute by minute, the great expanse of seats diminished, till the whole resembled a vast 2ark2rc, but that it bloomed with a richness and 'variety ot colour such as no garden ever showed, in this country at least. With the saine admirable maanagemuent that distinguished the festival of iMonday last, persons found their seats without trouble or hurry, and all the officers connected 'with tbe Palace were most painstaking and assiduous in their eflbrts to secure the comfort of all. Her Majesty and the Royal party arrived at the 'private entrance a few minutes before 1 o'clock. A guard of honour of the Grenadier Guards, under the command of Colonel Hlopwood, with the band of the regiment, received the illustrious visitors with the usual salute-arms presented and colours lowered. Sir Joseph Paxton and Mr. :Ferguson were in attendance to usher Her Mlajesty and suite to the apartments which have been erected for their accommodation at the north end of the building. After a delay of a few minutes, the Queen, accompanied by the Grand DukeMaximilian, and followed by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, hisRoyal Highness the Prince of Prussia, the Princeas Royal, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Alice, and suite, proceeded to the Royal balcony, -which ha l been handsomely fitted up in the north corner of the transept immediately facing the orchestra. As the Queen approached a buzz of expectation ran through the vast assemblage, which rose by a simultaneous movement, clapping hands, and waving hats and handkerchiefs with such ,enthusiasm that even the Queen, though well used to cordial receptions from her subjects, seemed completely moved, and curtesied repeatedly in acknowledgment of the welcome. Ere this burst of loyalty had quite subsided the grand strains of the National Anthem pealed through the building in massive sounding notes which made the very floors and pillars vibrate as though rustling with a beavy wind. When its solemn cadence had completely died away there was another outbreak of applause, not so much of course for the National Antheam (though magnificently given) as for the august lady in whose honour it wvas sung. As the audience settled themselves into their places, Mlessrs. Negretti and Zambra, the photographers of the Crystal Palace, took a beautiful photograph of the whole sceue, making the Royal box its centre. It was a perfect likenesi, and so well and quickly done that copies of it were printed, framed, glazed, and laid before the Royal party before the first portion of the oratorio had con-cluded. The spot from which it was tahen was the gallerv over the organ, whence perhaps the Znest c.'tp d'a.il which the festivals of this country have ever shown wns presented yesterday. Immediately beneath was the great organ, like a .cathedral 0of music, with every tower and pinnacle of its vocal friame sending forth avolunme of sound amid 'which (,,en 2,000 hurman voices were alnost lost. Round this, in a vaist amphitheatre, came the -chorus,-Costa lowest of all, with pale and earnest face, singing in conscientious love every note of the 3nusic lie regulated; while below the orchestra, again, was ranged the brilliant mass of visitors, rank oni rank, like the divisions of an army of old, all richness, pomp, and colour. These features alone would have made it a prospect -on wlhich the memory would dwell, but when to it are added the tiers of close-fille<d galleries, rising high and spreading wide-the noise of the chorus as " with the hiss like rustling wvin7s" they rose to volume forth, " Sinig unto God," the Royal visitors all beating time, and watching every note, and the solemni anxietv of attention which seemed to reign over all-it was grand and imprl,essive beyond all powers of (description. The ex-cation of Judas Muccubaus, to the sur- prise of amnateurs, was on the whole even better than that of the Messioch. The music beiug less familiar to the generality perhaps caused the -.ingers aRnd players to be nmore on their guard, an.I naore anxiously careful in taking up the points; but, whatever the reason, the result was as we have -stated. A vast improvement was also noted in the ,effect produced by the solo voices, and this tnay be traced to the fact that there was a much larger -crowd in the area and south nave-the galleries, affording a less favourable view of the IRoyal box and its distinguishied tenants, having ,been partially deserted for the seats b.low. Madame Novello'a clear anA penetrating voice was 1heard to much better advantage ia the National Anthem; and her high " B flat," which was the town-talk after the inaugumation of the Omystal IPalace three years since, again excited admiration. The oratorio of Jutdas 21accabcvns, although it inuat not be compared with the Messial and Israel -iq Eg t, is still one of the greatest compositions of MandsL The twelfth of the 19 works of the same .claes witten by the illustrious musician in this cotutry, it was planned and completed in the short sp tce of one month (when Handel was in hisr 61st year), and performed atCovent-gardenTheatre onthe 1st of April 1747. with great success. One of its principal charms ie the variety which the nature of the book suggested to the composer. This enabled Handel to break repeatedly from the bonds in which he was held by the insipid muse of Dr. Thomas Morel], and, soaring on the wings of genius, to make the world forget the dullness of the poet in the greatness of the musician. The three parts into which the oratorio is divided are happily contrasted-the prevalence of pathetic music in the firnt, of heroic in the second, and of jubilant in the third, stamping each with a certain characteristic individuahty of -which the composer successfully availed himself. The music has been so often described, and the larger part is so generally known, that to comment upon it now would be going over well-trodden ground to little or no purpose. It is enough to speak of the admirable manner in. which it was executed at the Crystal Palace on this memorable occasion, and of its enthusiastic appreciation by the audience. In the overture, one of Handel's most spirited orchestral preludes, the fugue was led off and responded to hy the violins and other stringed instruments with wonderful precision. The opening chorus (lamentation for the father of Judas), so sublime in its expression of grief, was remarkably well given, and the subdued under-tone of the voices on the words, "is no more," in beautiful relief. Equa'ly good was its companion in musical pathos, " For Sion lamentation make," which, besides its very striking progressions of harmony, contains a phrase bearing close resemblance to " Behold the Lamab of God," in the Messiah. The choral supplication, "0 Father whose Almighty power," was highly impressive, and the basses seemed determined to expiate their rare shortcomings on the occasion of the first performance. The fugue, to which the words, " and grant a leader bold and brave," is set, was everywhere pointed and accurate. In this chorus, and in several others, Mr. Costa has introduced brass instruments, often with great felicity and effect, but at times, we think, too lavishly. If this was noticeable in such an arena as that presented by the central transept of the Crystal Palace, how much more would that be the case elsewhere ? Handel's original score, it is true, sounds meagre to ears trained in the modera style of instrumentation, which would hardly tolerate an orchestra of "s trings," with oboes, bassoons, and occasional glimpses of trumpets, flutes, and horns. Bat the task of supplying what aandel has left undone is one of extreme delicacy. His vocal part-writing is masterly, his use of the stringed band (especially) broad and fluent; the nicest discrimination is tberefore indispensable in the choice of where and what to add. It is dangerous to double his melodic parts, and it is dangerous to interpolate new ones; so that, really, a close consideration of the matter can only lead to the conviction that the labour should be confined to filling up the harmony of wind instruments in plain and conspicuous places, discarding invention and composition altogether. If the added instruments are so employed as to darmage the clearness of the vocal parts, or to disturb the progress of the instrumental figures, effect is rather lost than gained by the innovation-since additional noise can by no means be considered an. equivalent for additional strength. These remarks are not directed against the new accompaniments of Mr. Costa, who is a conscientious as well as a practical musician, and is too well acquainted with the orchestra and its resources not to be thoroughly aware of what rocks and shoals are inevitably in the wayof any one, less than Mozart or Mendelssohn, undertaking to interfere with the scores of Handel, They are intended for general application. For years we have bad to submit to the meddling of incompetent hands in some of the greatest and most lasting works of genius; and if Mr. Costa wivl make up his mind to bestow serious attention to the subject he may accomplish reforms for which the musical community may have to thank him. The other choruses in the first part were sung in very satisfactory style,-" We come, we come" (in the samne key as "He gave them hailstones," from Israel, and in some points bearing a strong similarity to that wonderful piece); "Lead on, lead on," and " Disdainful of danger "-short, bold, and vigorous illustrations of the same sentiment, and appearing in bold relief after the solemn character of what precedes them-were all effective. But still better was the final chorus, "H ear us, 0 Lord," which embodies simultaneously, and with infinite grandeur, the sentiment of religious faith and the enthusiasm of martial ardour. Mendelssohn evidently hadthis very fine composition in his mind when he wrote the noble and ingenious chorus in St. Padl, "Oh, great are the depths." The first part of the oratorio could not have terminated with more splendid effect. after the usual interval, which Her Majesty the Queen and her faithfnil subjects devoted, we believe, to much the samne object-that of reEreshment, the second part of Judas Maccametas commenced majestically with one of the most superb and dramatic of all the choruses of Handel-" Fallen is the foe: In this grand inspiration the author of the Messiah has displayed the singular faculty he possessed of seizing hold and developing any marked idea that might be presented to him through the medium of no matter what kind of poetry. Dr. Morell (happily) has refrained from treating the subject at any length. His allusions to the victory of Judas, and the destruction of the enemy, are comprised in a not very transcendant couplet:- "FaU'n is the foe; so fall thy foes, 0 Lord, "Where warlike Judas wields his righteous sword." That is all. But it was enough for Handel, and helped him to contrive a masterpiece-a musical poem o. astonishing and varied power. The only objection we have to make to Mr. Costa's additions here is that lie has filled up the intervals in that remarkable passage where the voices reiterate the word " Pall'n," three times, in an underbreath, the mysterious effects of which cannot but be injured by any interpolation. In this, anad in the tunefuil aDd beautifuRly harmonized choral piece which chimes in with the duet, " Sion now her head shall raise," the multitude of singers earned nothing but laurels. The high note (A) of the trebles and alcos, sustained during two bars, on the word " harps," was nothing short of thrilling. The pathetic chorus, " Ab, wretched Iser' (where the Jews are in despair at the approach of Antiochus) would have been irreproachable, but for the substitution of loud for soft in the concluding passage, which violated Handel's meaning without improving hin. The finest choral performance of the day, however, and onie of the finest probably ever litened to, was that of the glorious and magdificent "WVe never, never will bow down" (in which, by the way, Mr. Costa bas employed the brass instruments with powerful anid legitimate effect). The sublime progression of harmony in the xaajor key-onthe words, "We worship God and God alone"-the bass of which is afterwards treated, with extraordinary ingenuity, as a plain song (" canto fermo"), combined with an independent fugue-was delivered with astouuding force; and from that point to the cliniax the choir seemed to accumulate power. The audience, to use a familiar phrase, were conipletely " carried away" by this wonderful performance, the most perfect and the most impres- .ive that, tip to this moment, has distinguished the Handel Festival. The applause was tumultuous. In the third part the most striking point was the well-knovwn " See the Conquering Rero comes," which was cipitally performed, and re-demanded with even greater vehemence than " For unto us a Child is born," on MIonday. Mr. Costa, however- consistent to the wise principle he would seem to have adopted-proceeded with the march, heedless of the uproar behind him. The audience continuing obstinate, however, and evidently indisposed to submit even to a wholesome despotism, the conductor turiied to the gallery in which the Queen was seated, as if for counsel how to act. The niatter was brie6y settled; Her Majesty, appear- it"g to entertain the same wish as that which had been unanimously expressed by her asbjects, conveyed a signal of assent, anid the favourite chorus was repeated. The " Hallelujah," which brings the oratorio to an end-liandel's least important composition of its class-was given in a stvle worthy of the rest, anid appropriately terminatedthis remarkably fine performarnce. The principal singers, as we have hinted, were far more successful than on Monday, and for the reason already suggested. The chief honours of the day were awarded-and justly awarded-to Mr. Sims Reeves, who delivered the three trying airs, "' Call forth thy powers," "H ow vain is man," and "Sound an alarm," in a manner we have neven heard surpassed by any singer. As an examplaeoI florid exw.oin I "How vain is nsan" was ;nbsolntely faultlesa, wlsile the two great war sougs - maerpieco al declaub, tion. The impression made upon the e4wd waa commensurate with the perfection of the singing, and at the conclusion of each piece Mr. Reeves was honoured by a burst of applause as unanimous as it was enthusiastic. Miss Dolby was next entitled to commendation. Nothing could be more purely devotional than her "Pious orgies," nothing more correct and artistic than her "Father of Heaven," while in whatever concerted music she took rt he equally excelled. The sopranos, badame Novello and Mladame Rudersdorff, both had their triumphs-the former in the air, "From mighty kings," from which she discreetly omitted all .the antiquated shakes, the latter in "Wise men flat[tering," which obtained immense applause. AIr. Montem Smith acquitted himself ably as second tenor ; and the bass muaic was divided between Herr Formes and Mr. Weiss-the recitative and air, " Arm, arm, ye brave," being the distinguishing effort of the German, while "The Lord worketh wonders" gained most credit for the English singer. This improvement in the vocal solos (or rather, perhaps, in the effect they produced) was not the least gratifying incident of the day. After Judas Maccaheus (at the Queen's desire, if we are rightly informed) the old 100th psalm was sung, Her Majesty and the whole assembly standing. The third verse-" Oh, enter then His gates with praise"-was given in unison by the united voices of the 2,000 choristers. A more grand and impresaive effect cannot be imaginled. Hydn and M. Berlioz (the musical antipodes of each other) would have gone into ecstacies about this performuance, just as they did about the charity children in S,t. Paul's Cathedral. The refreshment department is now most thoroughly organized; in fact, nothing but a great institution of comestibles could have met yesterday's drain at the Palace, when 6,000 dinners and lunhenons were served, very many thousand pints of sherry drunk, and 800 quarts of. ices distributed before 6 in the evening. The attendance at all the many counters was ample-people not only bad what they wanted, but whenever they wanted it, and Mr. Staples, with untiring energ,y, personally superintended the comfort of vis,itors to each department throughout the day. To-day,at half-past 3 p.m., Mr.George.Cooper (of St. Sepulchre and St. Paul's) is to perform upon the new organ of Messrs. Gray and Davison. On Friday the Hlandel Festival will be brought to an end by the sublime and unequalled Israd in Egypt, about the choruses in which the highest anticipations are entertained. Why, after that, should there not be a people's day-on Saturday-at halfa-crown? Who, if not Handel, was the composer for the multitude?
COUBT CIRCULAR. The Qaeen and Prince Albert honoured with their presence yesterday the performance of the Oratorio of Judos 2acccbeuw at the Handel Festival in the Crystal Palace, Sydenham.

I T'H ROYAL I ISIT TO MIA GHESTER. A lively discussion took place in the Manchester Tovn. council yesterday as to the reception to be given to Her Majesty in passing through the city on her way the Art Treasures Exhibition on Tuesday, the 30th of June. It was moved that the Committee for General Purposes be empowered to take such steps as might be desirable ; but an amendment was proposed that the expense be limited to 1,0004 On the one aide it was contended that, while there was no intention to incur any extravagant expenditure, any limitation of the amount would be to measure the loyalty of the citizens by just so much money. and that it would be better to do nothing than to do it grudgingly, while the fixing of a limit implied a want of confidence in the committee. On the other hand, it was stated that on Her Majesty's previous visit a sum of 5,0004 was expended in preparations which were never completed, and that the extravagant expenditure on that occasion showed the necessity of a limit on the present one. It was further urged that if the expenditure of 1,0004. was insufficient to measure the loyalty and good feelings of the citizens to Her Majesty, so also probably would be that of 3,0004 or anything short of what might be deemed an extravagant amount, and that it was better to leave demonstrations of this kind to the spontaneous feeling of the citizens; and that the erection of triumphal arches-which were usuaUy anything but triumphs of art-and of street decorations, by a corporate body, afforded no real evidence of popular attachment to Her Majesty, who would, no doubt, receive a much more cordial expression of welcome from the lips of the people than could be given in any other way. The amendment was carried by a majority of 32 to 19. Addresses of congratulation were adopted by the council fo be presented to Her Majesty and to his Royal High. ness the Prince of Prussia on the approaching visit. In both these addresses the approaching nuptials of the Princess Royal aud the Prince of Prussia were adverted to, with the expression of a hopethatthe unionmight be advantageous to the interests of the countries thus about tooebroughtinto closer relationship. The address to Her Majesty is to be presented at the Art Treasures Palace on the 30th, during the Queen's State visit, and after Her Majestyhas been conducted to the dais, and not on her entrance into the building, as was the case with the address presented to Prince Albert on the 5th of May, when the Art Treasures Exhibition was opened. The address to the Prince of Prussia is to be presented to his Royal Highness at the Manchester Town-hall on the following day (July 1), on his return from the Exhibition, and after Her Majesty has returned to W7orsley. The Prince of Prussia will be accompanied ia this visit to the Town-hall, to meet the corporatioa, by their Royal Highnesses Prince Albert and the Prince of Wales, who will afterwards, in aU probability, visit some of the principal manufactories and workshops it the neighbourhood. On the occasio n of Her MEajesty's visit to the Exhibition, on the 30th inst., the route of the Royal corMge will be through Worsley, Swinton, and Irlams-o'-th'-Height, to Pendleton, and thence along Broad street, Chapel-street (Salford), and New Bailey-street, entering M1anchester by the Albert-bridge, thence along Bridge-street, John Dalton street, Cross-street, St. Anne's-street, St. Anne's-square, Exchange-street, Market-street, Piccadilly, Portland-street, Oxford-street, Cavendish-street, and Gretford New-road, which leads direot to the entrance of the Art Treasue Palace. Her Majesty will probabiy arrive there between 11 and 12 o'clock, The hour for Her Majesty's second visit, which is to be a private one, has not been fixed. The returns for Tuesday were as follow:-Admissions by season tickets, 1,283; on payment of Is. each, 5,282: total, 6,565. Of the total number of visitors 1,699 arrived by railway. There were no excursion trains.
EAsT INDi:A COsirAY.-A quarterly General Court was held yesterday, Mr. D. R. Mangles in the chair. The Chairman announced that the warrants for the half-yearly dividends would bo ready for delivery on the 6th of July. The Committee of Bylaws was reappointed for the ensuingyear. Mr. Lewin moved that the Court of Directors be requested to take measures to remedy, as far as was now possible, the evils that had resulted from the breach of faith on the part of the Madras Government towards the 6th B.egiment of lIaght Cavalry. The Chairman said the mutiny occurred in 1844, and the subject had been frequently discussed in that Court; therefore, without meaning any disrespect to the hon. proprietor, he should decline entering into the matter. Ater a few observations from Mr. Jones, Ar. Relps, Mr.MIackenzie and othersthe motion was put and negatived. The Chairman, in reply to a question from Dr. Beattie, said that the Indian Government had not furnished any report as to the cause of the recent mutiny among a portion of the native Indian army. No doubt an investigation would be instituted and rneans taken to ascertain the real cause of the disorganization that had taken place. Mr. Lewin then moved the following resolution:-" That the manufacture and sale of opium by the East India Company are in violation of the law which forbids them, with certain specified exceptions, pursuing the avocation of shopkeepers and petty dealers, and are i their consequences injurious to the national character." The motion was seconded by Mr. Jones. Mr. Mackenzie said, the whole question in regard to the trade in opium would be decided by the motion of Lord Shaftesbury, for referring the matter, as to the legality or illegality of the trade, to the law-offlicers of the Crown. He believed it would be for the interest of India if the company's monopoly were abolished and the growth of opium thrown open, and an export duty imposed. The chaIrman said, it was quite obvious that the Indian Government could not put an end to the trade in opium, and that if it were thrown open, instead of one chest going to China 10,000 chests would be imported into that country. The auri sacrafames would frmstrate all Custom-house regulations, and China would be inundated with opium. After some farther discussion the motion was put and negatived. Mr. Jones then suggested that an arrangement should be made for the payment of daty on smaUl parcels previously to their being sent to India. The retail trade between England and India would be greatly increased thereby, as it would put an end to the pernicious agent-y system, which subjected the trader in this country to a deduction of 10 and even 15 per cent, from the fair price of his goods by way of commission to the agent. The chairman said the suggestion was deserving of consideration, but nothing could be done reepectinb it until a communication had been had wfith the Indian dovernment. The Court then adjourned. Tna FRIsENDi OF- THE CEEBaY 0 oBATIOu;.-The seventh anniversary festival of this society was held last evening at the London Tavern. The Right Hon. Sir John Paldngton, M.P.. presided, and in the course of his speech said,-"The object of the society was to grant pensions of between 301. and 401. a-year to the widows, orphans, and unmarried daughters of clergymner of the Established Church, and to offer assistance to clergymen in times of temporary distress. The number of clergymen in England, Wales, and Ireland amounted to more than 18,000, and the average income of by far the greater numher was not above 1001. per annum. This fact afforded the strongest appeal in behalf of a society which sought in some smail degree to remedy the consequences of such a state of things. There were at the present time 76 ladies pensioners on the funds, and 128 applicants for admission." There was a full attendanceof thefriendsof the institution. The contributions during the evening amounted to 466. and the subscriptions in the course of the year have realized to the society 5,0001. The dinner was exoellently served, and the musical arrangements, under the direction of Mr. Francis, gave the greatest satisfaction. Mr. Harker was the toastmaster. TEE BEST AuTHORITy.-Ia he a burglar, or of the swell rmob ? I do aot accuse him of ocoupying either position (which would he libelous), bht I ask for information. Because my mimd is tormented by hisg4l§tually getting into houses into which he would keem to have no lawful open way, and by his continually diving into people's pocket-books in an otherwiss inexplicable manner. In respect of getting into the Queen's Palace, the Boy Jones was afoolto hirm. He knows everything that takes place there. On a late auspicious occasion, when the nation was hourly expecting to be transported with joy for the ninth time, it is surprising what he knerw on the question of chloroform. Now, Doctor Locock is known to be the most trustworthy even of doctors; and Her MajestZ's self-reliance and quiet force of character have passed mto an axiom. I want to know, therefore, how, when, where, and from whom did the Best Authority acquire ali that chlorofornm information which he was, for months, prow ling about all the clubs, going up and down all the streeis, having all London to dine with him, and going out to dine with all London, for the express purpose of diffusing? I hope society does not demand that I should be slowly bothered to death by any man, without demanding this much satisfaction. How did he come by his intelligence I ask? The Best Authority must have had an authority. Let it be produced. I have mentioned the pocketbooks in which he deciphers secret entries-many of them written, probably, in invisible ink, for they are non-existent evento the owner's eyes. How does he come by elI the ambassador's letter-bags, and by all the note-books of all the judges? Who gave hium all the little scraps of paper that the late Mr. Palmer wrote and handed about in the counrse of his protracted trial? He tells all sorts of people wiat wa in the all; he must have seen tbem, surelr. Who made out for him the accounts of this journal ? Who calculated for hin the sumu total of profit? And when will it be quite convenient to him to name an early day forhanding over to the Conductor the very large balance, with several ciphers at the end of it, which clearly must be owing the said Conduct-or, as he has never laid hands on it yet ? How did he get into the Russian lines H Be was always there; just as he was always in the EnFlish camp, and alw-ays coming home to put Mr. Russell right, and going back again. It was he who found out that the Comuiisariat wouldn't give TA4 Trimes rations of pork, and that the porkless Tim es would never afterwards leave the CommLlsariat alonie. Had he known much of the Russian leaders before the wan, that lae began to talk of them so familiarly by their surxames as snon as the first gun was fired? Will any of us e er. forget, while memory holds her seat in these distracted globes, orr aching heads, what we suffered from this mau in connexion with the ledan? Can the most Christian oLg uas ever forgive the lies he told us about the Malabihoff? I might myself overlook even those injuries butfor his having put so manypeople up to making plan of that detesatofortress on table-cloths, with salt. spoons, forks, desse*dikhes, nut-crackers, and wine-glasses, -Dickenss Housio!si'd Word&` BRtISTOL SU&;-3xAssscu, Wednesday, June l7.- We had a goo&bnsiness doing in sugas@T lsst week, at prices 6& to is pe} co'a. nbow4 those obtainable the week pre. * '.ous.

THE IND!AN DISAFFECTZOZf. TO THE EDITOR OF TEiE TIMES Sir,-Having just seen the letter from " 5pectator Orientalis " in your columns on the above sabiect, I cannot forbear writing a few lines. I have also had "several years' experience " in Indi, ihough not at Renares, and, while I fuUy agree Nvith your correspondent that the labours of the missionaries and the support given to them are in no possible way the cause of the disaffection, I believe his experience in referance to the regimental officers must have been very limited and also un_ fortunate. I have had no experience in the Besgal Presidency, though I have not unfrequently met o§cers of tbat army in India whose characters were very different from. that represented by *- Spectator," but I have rusided in various and very distant stations under tlE Mldras?residency, and I can say that the officers I have been acquainted with have generally been active, anterpris!g,. and often studious. I have frequented manZmessroans, and. been domiciled ofteu with officers of the lative, Infantry regiments, theArtillery, and Engineers, and-in their priva4e. habits Iwould represent themin the mxasaasbeinjvory, veoy far from an " idle, dissolute, extravagan, gambling, brandy. pini-drinking set of men."

Ihe stady of tie languages, the art ot war and texrtifica'don, ciltivatibg tbe SepoyS' confidence, the amelior ation di the atives, or even. natural history, botany, m'inralogy, geology, and sketehing, &-c., present endless soure es of asmsement and benefit. When I left India the Supp)' y of books had greatly increwed. but no doubt there is r' ,om for improvement ia this matter in many regimeents and various statics. It would be well if rome plan cou' .d be formed for facilitating the aupply of well-selected, volumes.

iFo01IWN INTFK GBYCB. FRA1VEI. (FnoM 0M OWNW OO SPO! DBNT.) [A porion of the following appe:red X our second edition EARI, TUESDAY, JTNn 16, 6 p.11. It must be admitted that, contrary to general expectation, the elecions are becoming very ani:mated. It is true that the animation is as yet confined to the candidates, but the movement seems to be'on the increase, and may gain the electors before it atopa. The Prefets are doing their best to stir up the Mayors, and the Mayors do their best to rouse the ardour of the peasants. The addresses and circulars of some of those functionaries are curious enough. Among the Government candidates for the department of the Seine-et-Oise is a gentleman mamed Camel de St. Martin, and the Mayor of Chaton, which is not far from Paris, has published an address to the electors, in which their sympathies are feelingly appealed to in his favour. The Mayor Rays - " Already familiar with the various requirements of the department, he is not ignorant of what is useful to you. He Imnows how to follow up affairs already pending in the different offices of the Administration, of which he possesses a apecial knowledge-all which renders the solution and the affairs themselves easy. Moreover, M. Carnel do StMartin during the session which has just terminated has become the son-in-law of M. do H. Marsault, our Prefect. This is an additional claim to your preference; they are the same interests which are united. Who can better represent in the Chamber the thoughts of the Prefect thanhis son-inlaw? Who can better defend your interests than he who has already obtained your suffrtges-than he who has united his destinies with the daughter of the most eminent magistrate of the Seine-et-Oise 'I Such claims have had their effect before, but have seldom been announced with more nairetU than by the worthy Mayor of Chaton. It was hitherto thought, or pretended, at least, that a deputylrepresented the intere3ts of his constituents at large. The deputy for the Seine-et-Oise, it seems, goes to the Legislative Body to represent the Preftct. If the 86 Prefects of France had each a son-in-law the electoral regulations might be simplified considerably, and some trouble saved by nominating at once those 86 sons-in-law to the Legislative Body. The Mayor of Bordeaux is said to have accompanied the voting tickeb which he issued to the indigent electors of that place with another ticket for 6f. each. Great exertions are being made to effect a combination between the Sicle and the Bstafetbe, which, as you are aware, present different candidates for Paris, though both are going on the Democratic interest. An opportunity is offered by the refusal of one of the Sicse's candidates, M. Reyneau, SubPrefect of Sceaux under the Republic. If a reconciliation be effected, M Eugene Pelletan, a name weU known in the Democratic press, would be admitted. No great hope, however, is entertained of uniting these sections of the party, and the division is likely to last. The SiZe contains the following analysis of the Legitimist press of the capital:- We have three Legitimist jourmnls in Paris-the Gamete de France, the Assebdc Nationale, and the Union. None of the3e papers agree at heart. The Gazete de France would experience difficulty in expressing what it really vants. It loses itself in barren words, which conceal the absolute vacuity of a policy that is without aim as it is without tact. The Gazee vrites for the sake of writing. Nevertheless, it has certain fixed principles-the sovereignty of the people, liberty, and monarchy. The Assem. bMe Nationale, on the contrary, marches boldly in tho path of denial of all sovereignty of the people. It persecutes liberty wherever it exists; it has a hatred of Jiberal Institutions; the word 'people' scalds its throat, and its aversion to universal suffrage It is impossible to describe. With respeot to Monarchy, its ideas do not appear clear, rnd it is difficult to state which is the monarchy It desires. Its legitimacy is slightly stained with fusion. Its sympathies are not warm for the elder branch of the Bourbons, and the younger branch possesses all sorts of faults in its eyes. The Union is undeniably the most serious of the three journals, and is decidedly in favour of the ancien rdgime. It lately approved even the right of primogeniture. Nevertheless, it is not hostile to liberty, espeially to testamentary liberty, which persuits convents to enrich themselves, and the liberty of education, demanded for the first time after the expulsion of the Jesuits. The Uniom is, moreover, as national in several of Its Ideas a the Assembfe is_anti-national. It witnessed with pleasure the suo. cesses of our asrm in the Crimea, which caused tho Aesemb!&c so much dissatisfaction. Such is the tonching agreement In principles, conduct, and tendencies which reis among the Legibimist journals. The one dedres the sove- I reignty of the people, another opposes it. The one pro. claims liberty, the others condemn it. And yet these three journals display the greatest bitternes in commenting on the dissensions of the Democratic party !" The same journal says.- " The electoral fever has gained Algeria, which, it is k-nown, is not represented in the Legislative Body. The journals of our magnificent colony ask whether this is just or politic. We shaU shortly examine this question." The Ursivers thus comments on the report addressed to the King of the Belgians by his Cabinet:- " The revolutionary party in Belgium has definitively triumphed. The riots in the streets, and the no less ilegal and dangerous rioting of certain municipal councils, have obtained complete success. The Belgian Government doss not confine itself to bowing its head before such demonstrations; it recognizes in them an expresdon of public opinion, and seeks to create au illusion by praising its prudence. This is one of the most deplorable examples of weakness and impotency ever offered by a Parliamentary Government."

In these times of steamers, railways, and electric telegraphs we are so accustomed to measure progress by a material scale that we assume visible material imnrovements in a country to be an Infallible in of its increasing prosperity, asd the absence of them just as infallible a proof of its stagnation or decay. This criterion may be true as regards the Wefst of Europe, and perhaps even there not without a qualification,but it certainly could not be applied, at least at present, to Turkey. turkey is to enter on a path qulite newr to her, and respecting whbich she can onl;y derive Imperfect, although valuable, information from the West. It would be therefore unjust to expect from her those rapid changes which astonish us at every steP in the West, and which alter and transformn the aspect of Europe in a few years, not to say months; and it would be wrong to suppose that no progress has been made because our eyes are not struck every moment by the visible signs of improvement. Every great ch.^nge in the life of a people must be preceded by 4 4alange in their ideas before it can manifest itWf'externally; and of this internal ne, W1o3i4ng ita way steadily agaiunst all opposi±ion'nd-o.favourable circumstanwe, there can be notWih-li^tee doubt. ILdt sis jol first of aUl at the effects whlch this cbsnqe a3 ideas has produced with respect to all questong oE material improvement. It is not SO yer since the first approach of T urkey toward wurope. Ugp to that tim he wls living isolated, sut in with scarcely any contact with thae Wetst, ignorant of the great progres which the litter was making, and not awrare of the superiority svl4) hi 9 apldprors was givig to Europe over all othex parto of thej_orld. To, ,,whohvn>er the advantages of everything tending to improve the material condition of a people, it maight almost seem absurd how anybody could be opposed to them; but we ought to remembeo how many prejudices had to be overcome before the most salutary changes, which ultimately proved mines of wealth, were adopted in Europe, and what distrust many new things excited which seem now Elf-evident to every one. The first thing, then, was to convince the Turks of tbe utility-nay, necesity-of borrowing from the West those means of material improvement which are looked upon as necessary conditions for the welfare of a people. This conviction is now spreading rapidly over all clamses who have the means of information, especially since the end of the last war. It is carrying everything before it, and prejudice and indifference have changed almost into over-anxiety. The best proof of this wil be found in reviewing the list of concessions wbich have been granted within the last eight monthsthe railway from Smyrna to Aidin, on which the Government grants 6 per cent. interest; the Euphrates line, which the Government glarantees likewise; the railway across Bulgaria and Roumelia, connecting the Danube with the Mediterranean, besides the railway from Rassova to Kostendje, which has passed the Council, and which will have the Sultan's sanction in a few days. To these concessions must be added that for the Red Sea telegraph, and last, but not least, the concession for the establishment of an Imperial Bank. It is true that all these concessions have hitherto remained only on paper, but it is surely not the Turks who are to blame for it. On the contrary, so anxions are they to follow them up, that, as soon as it became evident that the project of the Imperial Bank in Europe was not likely to succeed, they attempted the formation of another by means of native capitalists, the negotiations about which have been going on here for more than a month. Up to yesterday the combination was expected to be successful, but this morning many-tongued rumour speaks of a fatal disunion between the originators of the scheme. But, whether successful or not, this now attempt proves how much impressed the Government is with the necessity of an institution of this kind. This spreading conviction of a necessity of great reforms among the Turks, which I want to impress on your readers in this letter, is by no means confined to material improvements; it manifests itself imperfectly perhaps, and slowly, but still clearly enough to merit recognition. The regulations suppressing the trade in black sleves have been put into full force. Only a few days ago the Kangaroo, an English steamer, belonging to a native merchant, which brought troops from Egypt, was visited by Captain Glyn, of Her Majesty's ship Coquette, stationed in the Bosphorus, and six negro slaves were taken out of her and given over to the Turkish authorities. The brigandage which had reduced Epirus and Thessaly to a state of anarchy since the war has been completely suppressed. A score of brigands have been executed, and about 80 await judgment in the prisons. The merit in this case is due to Mehmed Pasha, Governor of these two provinces, and to his Lieutenant, Hussein Pasha, in IariaYa. A commission bas been sitting, as you will remember, to reorganixe the administration of the provinces, and considerable changes have been made wiith respect to the administration of justice, of which I shall have an opportunity of speakcing on another occasion. Even the delicate question of financial reform has comnmenced, and I am happy to say not without success. Every department has made some reductions in its own expenses. They are perhaps not so extensive as they might have been, but still they amount to a yearly sum of 100,000?., which is not a little, if one considers that hitherto the habit was not to retrench, but rather to increase the expenditufre and the budget in every way. On the other band, one branch of the revenue at any rate has been considerably augmented, and that vrithout any detriment to the people. This branch of the revenue is the Customs department. They are farmaed, ax~ you know, and every year in the spring an auction takes place. Each district is farmed separately, and in three of the districts-Smyrna, Salonica, and Beyrout-the sum haa this year greatly increased. As the duties remain the samne, the increase is paid by the rich contractors out of their enormous profits. Thus, you see, there is progress, although, peFhaps, to E uropean eyes, accustomed to the gigantic strides of material improvements at home, it may seem small. The great thing is, that there should be no standstill, which is so much to be apprehended in a place where intrigue is never at rest, and where a Government mus be continually on the alert against influences of one kind or another. The Sultan was to have made atour in the Sea of Marmnora, touching at Ismnid, Galjipoli, and several other places, wrhere preparations were made for his reception. At the last mnoment he changed his mind. Good-natured people say it is because he wants to wait for the ceremony of the circumcision of his son. Ill-natared people pretend that nobody would lend him 10,0001.; but how can this be, one might ask, as he is building three palaces entirely on credit I RIJSSIA . A letter from St. Petersburg of the 9th inst. says*. "&The haptism of the young Grand Duke Sergius took place yesterday in the chapel of the Palace of Tsarskoe Selo. The members of the diplomatic body, the high clergy, and the principal State dignitaries weore present. The Russianl ladiesvwere the national costume, and the men were in grand uniform. The Emperer aned the Imperial family went in proJcession, preceded and followed by the offiicers of the household from their private apartments to the chapel, the mperial infant being carried on acushion by the Princes3 SollykoE,; Lady of Ronour, the Grand Chamberlain Count Ribeaupierre and the Aide-dc-Camp, General Prince OrlofCi supporting the cushion. A t the entrance to the chapel the Emperor was received by the Mietropolitan of St. Peters. burg and his attendant clergy, who pres3nted the holy water. The Emperor then retired to an apartment near the chapel, the Greek Church forbidding parents to be present at the baptism of their children. The HIereditary Grand Duke held his infant brother in his arms to the moment of immersion, wihichwss effectei by Father Bajanof, confessor to the Emperor and Empress. The godfathers and godmothers w/ere the Empress Dowager, the Grnud Duke of Rees3e, the Grand Dukes Nicholag and MIichael, the Grand Duchess MIary of SaxeoWeimar, and the Queen Dowvager of the Netherlands. A l'e .Deum was afterwards chanted aid the ringing of bells and the roaring of cannon. Masis vvas celebrated by the Metropolitan, the E mperor bceing present. On the conclusion of the service the Chancellor of the Imperial and Rloyal Orders presented on a gold plate the insignia of the Order of st. Andrew, and the Emperor invested the young p rince with them. A dinner of upwards of 700 covers was set'ved at 5 o'clock, the foreign Msinisters being present at it. En the evening St. Petersburg and the town of Tsarskoe Selo were illuminated. " The ordinances issued durig the war for securing the circulation of specie and for controlling the rate of ex. change of gold are abolished and the former sateh of thing s re-established. By arecent ukase threegenerals and three superior officers n a number of high civil functionaries have been added to the government3s of Orenburg and Samara, which are the central points of the Russian Government for preserving and extending its3 influence in Central Asia." TEE STATE OF NAPLES. (FROM OUR OWrN COnnrSrorDXrT. NlAPLES, JON 11l The procSs against thoese accusedof murdering poor Mr. Blandford is now concluded, and waJpresentedto the Grand Criminal Court last Monday. On Taesday the deceased's remains were sent off to England. A very spurious humanity has prompted some of the foreign residents to raise their voices by anticipation in favour of the accused. Why has that voice beea silent, when for so many years the most flagrant acts of cruelty and injustice have been perpetrated throughout the length and breadth of the land ? There can be little sympathy with those who would plead in behalf of the presumed murderers of their fellow-countryman, and be silent or indifferent when thousands and thousands of unhappy beings were calling out for justice. A decree swa published on MIo-ay night wrhich has cheered all foreign visitors and residents in Naples. The price- of silver has been raised and fixed at D.1 34 1-10 par o7. of 30 trappesi of 1,000 millesimi of pure silver for the next six months, dating from June 16. The old standard price at te Mint from Medici's tim in 1818 up to 1854 was D.1 36 5-t1 per oz., being equal, according to some calculatioas, -to 23 grains the franc, and 575 grains the potnd *terling:- In 1854 itwasredoed to ... ... D.1 30 10 in las . ... ... 130. In 1856 ,, ,, ... ... 1 28 In 1857, first six months, it was raised to 1 32 4-10 In 1857, second mix months, , 1 341-10 There is a general anticipation that it will rise to its original value in December. If the par I hiave quoted above be correct, the present price of silver would fix the par of exchange at 22i the franc and 564 the pound sterling; but the freight of silver, insurance, and bankers' commission, as also the prenium on Bilver in France, will reduce it to 550. Its rise must depend on the amount of imports, which in a country where there is little power of consmption Comes0 to a tifle. ITALY. A letter from Bologna, of the 6th inst., informs us that for several days previously the Austrian troops who occupy that town had been constantly. employed in executing various manceuvres. General. Giulay, the Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian troops in the Lombardo-Venetian provinces, had arrived at Bologna, and was present at the military operations. One of those nanceuvres consisted of a sham insurrection, which was instantly suppressed. ThePontifical Gendarmes were posted at the corners. of the streets, to prevent the passage of carriages. and to leave the ground clear for the Austrian troops. The manceuvre concluded with a general discharge of artillery. The Austrians appeared anxious to show that though the state of siege is raised they had not quitted the town. Many of the inhabitants thought it a curious fact that a manoeuvre representing an insurrection. should be executed at the moment the Pope is about to pay the city a visit. It appears that the beat understanding does not exist between Monsignor Amnici, the Pope's Prolegate, and Count Degen feld, who commands the Austrian toops at Bologna. The General wished that Austrian troops should line the streets on the entrance of the Pope. Mlonsignor .Amici was perfectly aware that such a proceeding would irritate the population anmd diminish the chances of HIis Holiness meeting a good reception. Another cause of discord between the CardMnal and the General is, that the Cardinal wished that the Pope's guard of honour should be composed alternately of Austrians and native troops, but the General would not hear of native troops. On the 4th of June a travelliung carriage was stopped on the post road from Ferrara, at a distance of three miles from Bologna, by highwaymen, and the travellers (foreigners) completely stripped of everything they posse SPArN. (FROMt OU OWN CORUM:SON¢DEN2T.) MADRID, Jusu 12. As a curious illustration of Andalusian life and manners, I subjoin a translation of a letter received by a friend here from an enthusiastic lover of the bullring, a real tauromachian fanatic, at Puerto de Santa Maria. It is dated the4thinst., andirelates to the bullfighter Domiuguez. I have been obliged to paraphrase the elassic terms in which it abounds, and which have no exact equivalents in English:- " My dear Friend,-I have received the le'ter wheren you ask me for details of the great misfortune which we al lament, and I can give them to you very completely, slice I scarcely leave his bedside, except when absolutely comn oelled. Thus it happened:-The first 'oull was of a reddish colour, old, Barabbas by name, big-horned, shy, cowardlr. and very knowing. Twiee, as Dominguez advanced upon him at a wlk, he rushed out to meethim at such a distano that he with difficulty escaped the charge. After this, the bull standing rather near to the tabks (stout boards enclos ing the ring), with his head high and restless, Domingue3 attempted to give him a volap,io*which was the oompletion of the misfortune, and the last perhaps that will ever be given by this great combatant, who will eternally occupy the most brilliant page In the history of bullfighting; for having, contrary to his custom, chargai him from too far, the bull cut off his retreat, and succeeded in catching him with the right horn by the trimmings of the left side of his jacket, and, throwing him on to the left horn, inicted a woumd frightful to behold. Tbe horn grazed the lower jaw, passed through the palate, and knocked out his right eye. When he reached the to-ri (bal stable), which he did on foot (for he would allow no one l, touch him), his eye hung down to his mouth, suspended only by the optic nerve. The aspect of the bullring at tha moment he received his wound, and the cry of grief and dismay that burst from every mouth, defy description. Some faint idea may be formed of them if we bear in mind these words-tse wounded macan wa Dominguez. " Until I in the morning it was impossible to check the great hzemorrhage that ensued, and which all agreed must kill him. His body, his bed, his room, all swam in blood. As regards his present state, the phyician who is in constant attendance on him, Don Francisco Costal, tolls me that unless gangrene or cerebral inflammation sets in, he has hopes of saving him; that until now no symptom of those disorders has shown itself, but that many days must elapse before he will be out of grievous danger, although he has In his favour an iron constitution. What gives the doctor most uneasiness is the eye, for he says that while he, Medinilla, and two celebrated practitioners from Cadiz, were consWuting what to do with it, and finally agreeing to complete its removal, a physician from Xereo, amid the confusioa that prevailed, made his way into the torN, and replaced the eye in its socket, and thus they found it when they wentto sever the nerve by which it hung. They did not think proper to extract it again, because a little inflammatioa had already set in, and they must have caused him fresh suffering. Moreover they were convinced, in those early moments, that the hammorrhage oould not be restrained, and that he would shortlyc die. The doctor told me also that the eye must inevitably be lost. Such is the present unhappr oondition of our dear Dominguez; but he is great even in mifBortune, for no one has heard him utter a single complaint. He speaksto me every day on whatever subject oc curs to him, and as if nothing were the matter; and if any one asks him how he finds himself he says that he sleeps well and quietly." Were the victim a victorious General and hero, desperately wounded in a crowning triumph, he could hardly awaken greater solicitude, or be spoken of with more admiration and respect. But bullfighters are heroes in Andalusia, and heroes of no small calibre; and something of the enthusiasm seems to communicate itself to foreigners, for the southern papersinform us that at Malaga, the other day, the Polish Prince who is travelling with the Duke of Hamilton threwr a purse containing 10 ounces of gold to the famous Cuchares, who had killed a bull in his honour. The Three per Cents. were done at 40.40; ditto, Deferred, 26.15. * A vvlapid is when the matador springs towards the bull, thrusting at the same time, instead of waiting his charge, and allowing him to run upon the sword.

At the trial, which tookpPlace at Glocester at the last sasizes, the plaintiff obtainedl a vejrcUt, with 501 dlamages; but a rale was subsequently granted for a. new trial upon the rund that the verdict was against the evidence h erjeant PIGOr and Mr. GosFITS (with whom was Mr. Huddleston) now showed cause against the rule. The Solicitor-General and IfMr. Phips appeared co stpport the rule, but were not heard, as r.Justice Coleridge was obliged to go to Chambers. The hearing of the case was adjourned till Friday, the 26th inst. PAC}R V. WZTZsRBOT]LU The plaintiff in this action was a farmer, and he brought the present action aeabast the defendant, J. B. Winterbutham, a solicitor at Cheltenham and Tewkesbury, to recover possesson of a deed of transfer of mortgage, upon which he tthe plaintiff had advanced the sum of 3501. At the trial, which took p ace before Mr. Justice Crowder at the last Glocester assizes, it appeared that the defendant, in order to establish his son, who was also a solicitor, had purchased the business of a Mr. Thomas, a solicitor at Tewkesbury. The plaintiff had intrusted Thomas with 8001. to be laid out on mortgage, and of this sum Thomas was to employ 3501. in obtainingthe transfer of amortgage of some property at Glocester. Having got the money Thomnas deposited a memorandum of the transfer with the bank as security for an advance which he obtained, and subsequently absconded. The defendant in the meantime had purchased Thomans business, and when applied to by the plaintiff and his solicitors for the transfer deed he, according to their evidence, admitted that he had the deed in hts possession, but wanted the plaintiff to agree to take a cemposition of 1lOe. in the pound in respect of his claim. This the plaintiff refased to do, and the present action was brought. The defendant, on being examined, denied that he had ever made such an admission as the laintiff and his solicitors spoke to, but the jury found a ver'eaet for the plaintiff with 3501. damages. A rule ws subsequently granted for a new trial upon the ground,-1, that the verdict was against the evidence; 2, suspicion; 3, that the deed was never executed; and 4, that the damages were excessive. Mr. PowEnL now showed cause against the rule, and contended that there was no ground for disturbing the verdict. The SoLIcIToP.-Gzs,Xkx (with whom was Mr. J. Brown) supported the rule. Mr. Justice EBLxE after conferring with Mr. Justice Crompton, said,-We feel much pressed by the plaintiffs evidence, which was very cogent, and wre by no means wish to express any opinion on the verdift or upon the case, but, under all the circumstaneow, we think it best there should be some further inquiry up6o the one point whether the defendaut did or did not withhold the deed from the plaintiff. As to the other pcoints, wFe o not think there should be any further inquiry. There will, therefore, be a new trial, on payment ot costs, on the single point I have mentioned, and the platiffmay have liberty to change the venue to London if he thinks proper to do so. (SWings at Nz7s Pmius Wfore Lord CAxs:PrBT and Specic Jurier.) THE QUEER V. HRLABL The indictment in this cae charged that the defondar t, "on the 231 day of August, 1856, unlawfully did take one Rose Goodman out of the possession and against the will of her father, Abraham Levy Goodman, she, the said Ross Goodman, then and thexe being an unmanieed girl under the age of 16 years, to wit of the age of 14 years and 10 months." I Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. metcalfe, and Mr. F. H. Lewis conduoted the case for the prosecution; Mr. Serjeant Shee nd nlMr. Gifford appeared-for the defendant. IMr. Serjeant BALLANTnX aid It was his duty to state the facts on which this indictment was founded. The offence with which the defendant was charged was one under the statute of 9 George IV., cap. 31 sec 20, which enactedthat any person who should take au unmarried girl under 16 years out of the possession of her father and against his will should be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour. The prosecutor in this ease was a person namned Goodman, and the young woman, the unfortunate person connected with the transaction, was his daughter Rose. In July, 1856, she was staying at Hammersmith with her father and mother, when out walking one day she met the defendant, who had formerly been in the Austrian service, and was then a captain in one of the Middlesex regiments of Militia. He entered into conversation with her and gave her his card. She afterwards showed it to her father, who destroyed it. A short time after the prosecutor and his family removed to Brighton; the defendant appeared to have followed them, and saw the girl again and expressed himself very warmaly towards her. After a few weeks she returned to Loodon. He persevered in his attentions, and at length proposed she should leave her home with him. During all this period he professed his intentions were honourable, that he wished to make her his wife, but that his mother was a very religious woman, and would not allow them to be marmied in E ngnd. The result was the girl consented to leave home with hum, and on the 23d of August she met him by appointment, and proceeded with him toFolkeetone, and thence to Boulogne After she was missed the prosecutor followed them to Boulogne, and then went to Paris, where he eould find no trac of his daughter, and he was obliged to return home. It would appear from the statement of the girlthat when she and the defendant went to Boulogne the marriage did not come off. Defendant made excuses from time to them, but at length contessed he was a married man. This occurred at Mhayence. From that time she had no further intercourse with him. He abandoned her at the hotel at Mayence for a few days. She wrote to her father praying him to receive her back. He wrote to her to meet him at Ostend. The defenidai6, who had in the meantime returned to Mayence, accompanied her to Ostend. They there met her father. Some communication took place between the parties, and the defendant accompanied them to the pier, but the prosecutor then told him that if ever he came to England he would give him Into custody. Nothing more was seen of the defendant until the early part of this year, when the girl saw him in London. She told her father, and he at once gave information to the police and had the defendant arrested. If these facts were proved, he (Serjeant Ballantine) did not think there could be any doubt that the defendant had committed an offence under the sttate; when it was first enacted some of the Judges entertained a doubt whether some force was not requisite to constitute an offence under the statute. But in the case of " The Queen v. Manktelow," reported in Dearsly's CriminaZ Cases, it was decided that the offence was committed if the girl was taken against the will of her parents, although she might be a consenting party. He could not imine what I answer would be made to the charge. Inquiries bad been made, and some person brought from the Insolvent Court to get up some case against the prosecutor, who was unfortunately cennected with thc turf, but his character was no justiication for a person of mature age who had taken advantage of the inexperience of an innocent girl to obtain possession of her forimproper purposes. Lord (XArsrnnnr. said, he had been a party to the decision to which the learned counsel referred, and had aoted on it since. Tho witnesses on both sides wore ordered out of court. The first witness called was Bose Goodman. who, in answer to Mr. Serjeant BALLANTnEF, said,-In July, 185S, I was living with my father and mother in the New-road, Hammnermith. My mother was theu very ill, and is since dead. I was walking out one day In that month with a cousin who was staying with us, when I met the defendant, Captain Erlam. It was in the afternoon. I met him in the Tarnham-green-road. There was a band playing. He gave me a programme of the music. He was not in uniform. He spoke a few, words; he said he had been trying to get an intr duction to me, bat had not been able. I saw him -again the next day near Turnham-green; we spoke together. I met him several times at the same place. On one occasion he gave me his card. Some little time after I gave it to my father, who threw it into the fire. Soon after that we went to Brighton. I saw the defendant there several times; he aslked me whether I would nirry him? I said, " Yes." After that we came up to London, where I again saw him frequently. He spoke again of marriage; he raid hismother was a very religious woman, and would not give her consent to our marrying in Eugland; he said if I would leave En-land with him his mother would give her consent. I said, "No." The matter was several times talked of by him, On the 23d ofAugust I left my father's house; he wrs then living in Oxenden-street. I did not mention either to my mother or father that I was about to go. I met Captain Erlam at the bottom of the Eaymarket by appointment. I took nothmig -with me. Tins was on a Saturday. To Lord CAMP:ELL-The appointment was made on the Wednesday before. To Serjeant BALL.&-Tn ,-There was a brougham waiting. We droveto the South-Eastern Railway. We found a coupe engaged, and went down to Folkestone, and thence to Boulogne the same day. We went on to Amiens without stopping. We passed thenight there, Wfe slept togetherinthe same bed. Before we gottoAmless I asked him about oar marriage. Hle said e would write to his mother; he would have an answer in two days, and would marry me at Fkfort. From Amiens we went to Brussels, andlultimately to Mayence, He said frequently that he would marryme direcm y we came to Frankfort. We never went there. He madno other excuse for not marrying me. He said he was perfectly able to do so directly he got his mother's answer. In about three weeks time he showed me a letter which he said he had received from his motbhr, iL which she said that my " papa knew he was married." Up to that time I did not know he wl mareio.. Tnis was at hlAyence. After that I did not live with him in the same way as before. We were staying in apartments. He told me there was no use in my leaving him, but that if I would stay in the same house with him he would write to England and get a divorce, and marry me in a few weeks. From that time he had another room ; he did not leave the apartments until I wrote to my father. I was then left in the house with a servant. I got a telegraphio message from my father, and left Mayenco. Captatn Erlam accompanied me to Ostend. We got there before my father. The same day as my father arrived he took me back to England. From that time until the 27th of April I saw nothing of Captain Erlam. I then met him by accident in Regent-street. I told my father immediately. To Lord CaPBEL}.-I did not speak to Captain Erlam when I met him in Regent-stret. To Mr. Seajeant BAL3LATs.-I took no clothes from my father's houue,I found Captain Erlam had provided them foa,rme. They were in the brougham when I got in. He had sid he should brlng some. Croes-examined by Mr. Serjent Sn E -I had been living at Tarnbhamgreen about three or four weeks before I met Captain Erlam the first time. My compaion, M3iss Cohen, ha been there only a week~ WYeo ruently walked out t,ether. I knew where the barracks of the Militi were, We had several time walded pasL I hinksome of ths officers were living ii the hoteL I had aeenenem, at the windows. I had not spoken to any of them before Captain Erlam spoke to me; there was nobody with him. He never called where I lived. I gave the card to my father some time after. I cannot recollect bow often I had spoken to Captair Erlam before I did Eo. He had walked with me and Miss Cohen and another gentleman. I used sometimes to go out tomeet him; never after dark. It was sometimes by aPCointment. I never wrote to him while I was at Hammersmith. I told him where I lived in London. My father keeps a tobacconist's shop t'here. I returned ts London at the end of July. I then met Captain Erlam frequently, and wrote to him several times, making appointments to meet him. Mr. Page was generally withihim wben I met him. I came alone on several occasions. We generaly met about 4 o'clock, and remained together for an hour or half aa bour. We walked together. I met him once at my dressmaker's by appointment. I did not tell him I was going to Brighton, nor did I write to him from there. I saw him four or five days after I arrived. I was walking on the parade with my mother. I took no notice whatever of him. I scarely saw him. I do not know whether he saw me at the time. His friend followed me home. I was staying on the Old Steyne. I saw him the next day. HIe asked me what hour I would meet him. I wrote it on an envelope and threw it outofthewindowtohim. Itold himwhereI should be, and at what time. He could not see the time, as it was uLbbed out; but I 3net him the same day, or the next, and made another appointment to meet lnm at the Pavilion Gardens. I met uim there nearly every morning, about 8 o'clock, while I remained in Brighton. I never met him in the evenimg. My father was inxBriohton aU the time. My uncle Michaul was there for a few dy8. I do not know if he saw me with Captain Brlim. I know a Mrs. Mitlhel, at Brighton. She keeps tho house where we lived. She is the wife of Mr. MitchelL I do not know anythingabout her-whether she is married ornot. We havelodg ather house fortwo summers I went out with her twice. Iwent to Rottlngdean with her and Captain Erlam. It was at Brighten he first spoke tome about leaving home with him. He did not tell me he cou]d not marryme. He did not say anything of the kind, and I did not say that I would her live wth him as hi mistress than marry one of my own people. To Lord C-sLL.-My father and myself are of the Jewish persuasion. To llr. Serjeant SHIEE.-I did not say I would rather live with him as his mistress than with the gambling set of people I was anong. I swear I did not know that he was so cirmumstanced as that he could not marry me. I was in London two or three weeks before I went away with him. I met him every day during that time. I wrote hima letter from Brighton. ('fhe letter was then read.)

Before I went to Brighton I wrote to him:- | ' Dearest rlam.-IshouIdhave wittengStarday evening,butl had notime. You sked me what made me so serious and changed.

He told me he expected an appointment at the Cape of Good Hope, that he would take me there, and meet probably I would never come to England again. It was to that I referd then, as it wvould be dreadful to be without a friend. I did not learn from him who his relatives were. He told me his mother was living in Kingston. I told Mrs. Mitchell where she lived. AfterI went abroad I wrote home from Amiens, either to mamma or papa. I wrote the sane evening I got there. He wrote lso. I had no disagreement with him until he showed me the letter from his niother. We had been at Mayence three weeks or a month before that letter was shown to me. At Mayence he pretended to be ilL I do not think he kept his bed. He might have done so for one day. He had a doctor. I had no disagreement with him before I raw the letter. In consequence of my writing to papa he left me for three or four days. I was without money, and with a servant of whose language I did not understand a word. I was told by the person upstairs that he left 40 dollars for me to go to England wits, and that he himself had gone to Paris, Italy, or Vienna. When I said I would write to my father he struck me 6everaltimea, and threatened so cut my throat. I do not recollect his saying anything about a Prussian officer at the taWW dVMte. I did not want to ride out with one while Erlamwassick. Ilnow whoyoumean He gaveme abouquet and Erlam another at the same time. I never saw him but when Erlam was there. I did not orush Oaptain Erlarfs beforehisfaceandputthe other ittmybosom. IbelieveI threwboth out of the window because Erlam said something about it. I did not disagree with him because he would not goto the expens I wished. A family named Bourtnel lved upstairs. I did net see much of them; he did. He struck me twice and threatened several times to cut my throat. Imade no complaints to the Bourtnels. I could not speak to them. I had two letters from my father. A person came to me and said that if I would write to Erlam he would take it to him, but would not tell me where he was. I sent him one of my father's letters to Erlam. The letter from my father was- "I sI d I tEd ~~"New/market, Oct. 4. isis. ',I received your letter this day enclosed from Josaeph. I cannot erme or send till next waele.

A. h GOODM&lq n I wrote underneath this:- " Dear Josh.,-I don't even for a moment believe that your mother knows anything about it. and I don't think eOU are a villain." Before I sent him that letter he sent a person over to say he had written to England, and had had an answer from his lavyer to say he would get a divere in two or three weeks, when he would m^rry me, asd so satisfy my father. He sent me a letter with those words in it, which he afterwards tore up. The letter read was the first I received from my father. I did not live with Captain Erlamn after sending him that letter. We left MIayence for Ostend together; he slept in the house for two nights at Mayence, but in his own room. We stopped at Cologne; he then said that if I would not write a letter he dictated he would leave me quite alone, to get to Ostend as I could. I at first refused, but was obliged to do so, as I had no money. We were at Cologne only three or four homus I wrote to him from Mayene:- * My dear JoSgh.-Yon cannet tbhnk bow happy readung Your letter has made me. and you may be assurd whstever pass may say about y"u. ran never make me love you lens, and believe me. dearest, that I wai do everytbing you desire, it you wfi Only try me once more. 1 wrote everything I could to papa about you to make him albr his opinion about you. and when ha knovs you I am sure he will think hn I do about you. come to me directly. dearest; you cannot think bow anxious I am to aRe yOU.

To Mr. Serjeant S E-I never d-d him and told him to go to hell, at least not that I know of; but he deserves to go there if any one does. I will not swear I never did. because I canmot recollect what I may have said. I will swear I did not frequently. I did not strike him at Cologne. I do not recollect writing the postscript to the letter. Lord CAmiPBELi.-Whatever may be the effect of it I think the jury vill not have mach doubt that it is all in the same handwriting. Cross-examination continued.-We went in the same cariage to Ostend. We weretherefor one ortwo days before my father. I know I went out one afternoon with himL We dined together, but we occupied two rooms. It was in the coffeeroom I first saw my father. He and Captain Erlam did no go out together.

To Lord CAMPBErL.-They were not very good friends when they were diningtogether. My father scarcelyspoke to him. There was no objection made to his being il my bedroom. Papsarefused to dine there unless he was allowed to pay for his own dinner. I believe he paid for all the dinners. I do not know that they had two cigars.

Lord CAPBELL.-Brotber Shee, do you propose to ahow any revious consent on the part of the father ?

The defendant was then ordered to stand forward Lord C Br~i proceeded to pass sentence. He said,Joseph Erlam, yon have been convicted by a jury of the offence with which you wrbe charged. It is quite clear Shat under this Act of Parliament you did take away this girl, nose Goodman, against the wll of her father, she bning under 16 years of age, for the purpose of corrupting her wer eon. Ira anfrid she has the misfortune to have a parent who does not waech over her as ite is his d o d, hod there are circumstances of mitigtiionhere which will icafm, once thle sentence I am about to pass. Were it notfortbem your sentence would be much heavier than that which I now feel it my duty to pronouce. To seduce an innocent girl, and take her away from her arents fcr the purposes of prostitution, under pretence of mauriage, is a grievous offence, aud whether She was willing or not it is still en offence under the Act. I do find, however, some circumstances of mitigation in your case, because there was mufch temptation throsn and t o-r way, and this inforusnate young wfoman acted with a de gree of levity 'which led you to suppose that she was notbunwillig to be the victim of your improper views upon her; but, notwithytnding those circumstances, and, censurig as I am bound to do the conduct of her father, I must look to the offence you have committed. You aLre a married man; and yet when thedyoung eature unde the age of 16 camne under your observation you deliberately planned a scheme to carry her off from her parents, and take-her abroad to obtsan possession of her person. The sentence which I feel it my dutyv to pronounCe on you for this offence is t>hat you be imprisoned in the House of C orrection -for the county of laliddlesex for the term of three calendar months.

The circumstsnces of the case, as they appeared from a number of letters which were read, were,-some time in the course of last year a difference arose between Mr. David Urquhart, late M.P. for Stafford, and Dr. Barter, of St. Anne's, near Blany, in the county of Cork. Mr. ROES, of Bladensburgh, who was a mutual friend of both parties, exerted himself to effect a reconciliation, but without 'sccer. *While EO engaged be wrote one or two letters to Mr. Urquhart, the tenour of which that gentlem COndsidered to be personally offensive to him, and he requested the defendant to write to the prosecutor as a friend of Mr. Ross to demand a retractation and apology.

This was an information against the brother of the defendant in the case which was tried yesterdayintbis court, and, like that, the present information charged the defendant with using certain subterranean and unentered premises and machines in the making of malt, and with practising various frauds upon the excise laws. The enal tics sought to be enforced amoued to nearly 100,000. Mr. wilde and Mr. Beavan appeared to-day for the Crown; hMr. Eiawkins and hEr. Prentice represented the defendant. When the case was called on it was announced that a verdict for the Crown had been arrived at by consent and -without troubling the jury with the details. The jury then returned a verdict for the Crown for (By Common Juries.) BAINKS V. STOATE. Mr. PETERSDORFF appeared for the plaintiff in this case, which was an action to recover 5E. 4s. for boots and shoes suplied to the wife of the defendant at BAth in 1853. he defendant appeared in person, and sought to defend himself on the ground that his wife had quitted his abode, and had so misconducted herself as to exonerate him from the obligation to discharge the bill of the plaintiff. The CEurF BARON wasof opinion that, as the defendant did not impute adultery to his wife, plaintiff was entitled to recover, and directed the jury to find accordingly, inti. mating at the same time that the defendant might take the opinion of the Court above next term on the question of his liability. CRAIG AND OTHERS V. SHEDDE&N. Mr. BofiU and Mr. Lush were counsel for the plaintlffa; and Mr. Macaulay was counsel for the defendant. The plaintiffs are Writers to the Signet, and this was an action of detenue for four documents, with a count on a special agreement to give up the said documents, for the breach of which they sought to recover damages. The defendant is the gentleman whose name has lately been trought prominently before the pubhc on the occasion of a motion made in his behalf by Earl Grey in the House of Lords, praying for a select committee. It is well known that the defendant had inbtituted certain proceedings in Scotland to establish his legitimacy, and in the event of success it appears that he would have obtained a large property which had found its way, for want of heirs of his Sather, into the hands of Mr. Patrick, the defendant in the Scotch suit. That gentleman opposed the proceedings of the defendant, and in the course of the suit four important documents were given in evidence, and lodged with the registrar of the court. These documents were alleged to be forgeries bv Mr. Shedden, and as his temporary posses. sion of them was desirable, the clerk of the plaintifrs, in 'tihe usasl course, borrowed them from the registrar, and gave him a formal receipt for them, thus rendering his principals responsible to the Court for their restoration. After this Miss Shedden, the daughter of the defendant, who took an active part in the litigation, obtained these documents from the plaintiffs, giving a written receipt for them and an undertaking to return them. When the Scotch Court gave judgment against Mr. Shedden he appealed to the house of Lords, where he was equally unsuccessfuL During the hearing at the bar of the House, the docnments in question, which Miss Shedden had handed over to Messrs. J. Maitland and Co., the Parliamentary agents of her father, were by those gentlemen delivered to the defendant, who likewise gave a written receipt for thema. On the termination of the appeal it becane necessary to return these documents to the Scotch Court, and a formal application was made by the officer, at the instance of Mr. Patrick, to the plaintiffs, who in their turn demanded them from Mr. Shedden, but without success. The result was the iEsue of a process for their recovery against the plaintiffs, known to the Scotch Courts as n " Commision of Diligence and Havers," which, if carried out to extremities, would subject the plaintiffs to line and imprisonment. The plaintiffs, however, applied for relief to th Cout, ad thoe prceedng there objectionsorder tha they might htave teh°he Popopoeretunigty to do theyir best to recove the ocminssingdoumentso bylglpoedngsiaganst thve dreent.

The CHE'F BanRON havingg overruled these objections, inquired whether Mtr. Shedden could not and would not give up the documents in qutetioe m spr. MA CAyInoLeY, in erply, stated that his client was ceartainly a moet unfortunate man. Without offering any opinion prejudieial to the character of ais opponents in the legal proeeedings to which ealluion had been made, it was egh to sedy that, though {he House of inords had Riven gcdgment against umr. liedden, no less a man than Lord Grey had, npon information since gained, and throwing a newo bEt upon the subject miatter of the defendant's suit, moved for a select commit. tee to inquire into the whole matter. This motion had been supported by no less a peer than Lord Lynch hurst, so that it w7as clear that in the opinion of these nloble lords a case existed which called for further investigation, 51 r he part of the Hiouse. That motion, however, was unsaeesaful, but aS the doculments which were the subject of t.',is uction wvere alleged to be forgeries by 1Mi. Shedden, and ss he wvas desirous of pursuing his inquiries and claim to the utmost ltmit, it was very desirable that somue arrangement should be come to under which access could bo had by him te, them in the event of their being csveav up. At present they w.qrO tas wle gathered, in the custody of th = 'fnat,h2 Mr. LJuiu was readY to do a"> thing in his clien,t's power to asst Lir. Zhedde .z, but they were bound to restore tho documents to the couzt under heavy penalties, and if Mr. Shedden would apply to the Court for their protection thb would gledly assist him. ue Cuma BARox said that, in his opinion, nothing could be more unfortunate than that a speoial Act of Par; liameut should he made on bebalf of a litigant after a solemn judgent had been given in his cause. He, however, agreed, as these documents were stated to be forgeries, that the mere possession of office copies would not assist Mr. Sbedden, and it was but right that some such arraugement should be made as had been alluded to by Mr. Macaulay, by which access to the originals would be secured to his client. At present the plaintiffs were, in his opinion, entitled to recover the documents and the costs they had been put to by the detention of them on the part of the defendant, but he should stay execution till the 5th day of next term, with the view of giving the parties an opportunity for an arrangement. Mr. LusHi assented to that course, and on his suggestion the documents were severaUy valued by the jury at 1,0001., and a verdict taken for the plaintiffs for 4,0601., subject to the return of the documuents and the suggestion of the learned judge.

The list for that parisb, which the mayor and assessors had treated as an invalid list, was, in point of fact, a good and sufficient one, which it became the duty of the mayor and assessors to revise. The matter came before Mr. Justice Coleridge on the question whether the course adopted by the mayor and assessors was a legal and valid one.

CENTRAL CBIMINAL COURT, June 17. OT.Tn fnATTTp (Before M-. Baron WATSON and Mr. Baron CIAnNZLL.) Rebecca bose Hamnilton, 33, a respectable-looking woman, waa charged with feloniously sending a threaten. lng letter to WilLiam Alagham, with intent to extort money. Mr. Bodlin and Mr. Fry conducted the prosecution ; the prisoner had no counsel. The learned counsel for the prosecution said that the charge against the prisoner was made under somewhat extraordinary circumstances, and, although he regretted that his duty compelled him to make an accusation of so serious a kind against a woman of apparent respectability like the person at the bar, he was afraid, from the instructions furnished to him, that the jury could not entertain any doubt that the prisoner had been concerned in a system of sending threatenmg letters of the most abominable dessription to a great number of respectable mercantile gentlemen in the city of London. It would appear that for a considerable period letters of this descrsption, and wbich contained threats of the most abominable kind, were sent to a great number of gentlemen, and the police were for a long time unable to find out any clue to the parties by whom those letters were sent; but at length the prisoner was taken into custody, and-was tried at the last session of this court for a similar offence to the present. Upon that occasion she was acquitted, and at her own request the present indictment was postponed to this session, and when the jury had heard the evidence he should lay 'oefore them it would he for them to say whether they could entertain any reasonable doubt that the letter which was the subject of the inquiry was written and sent by the prisoner, and, if this was made out to their satisfaction, it would be their duty to find her guilty upon the present indictment. Mr. W. Alihngham, the prosecutor, deposed that he was asurgeon, and in February last he resided in Moorgate. street, but had since removed to Finsbury-square. On the 17th of that month the letter now produced was given to him by one of his servants, and afterfhe had read it he cormunicated with the police. The prisoner was an entire stranger to him, and he had never, to his knowledge, seen her before she was taken into custody. The letter was put in and read. Its contents were, of course, quite unfit for publication. Mrs. Emily Bruff deposed that she lived at No. 5, Bridge. water-square, Barbican, and she had known the prisoner for five years. and she had been her lodger for nearly the whole of that time. She formerly got her living by stock. making, but latterly she had not had any employment. She had frequently seen the prisoner write, andshebelieved that the letter that had been received by the prosecutor was in her handwriting. She remembered the officers coming to her house, and she showed them the room occupied by the prisoner, and saw them take away some papers from her The prisoner asked the witness whether one of the letters that were found in her room was not addressed to a girl named Emily Taylor, and she rephed that it was. In re-examination the witness said that Emily Taylor was a girl who worked for the prisoner. Bul, one of the city detective officers, deposed that the letter in question was placed in his hands, and he made aU the inquiries in his power with a view to trace the author. He went to the addresses named in the letter where the money was to be sent, but could obtain no information respecting the prisoner. On the 22d of April ha went to the lodging of the prisoner, and he there found in a box the two letters that he now produced. The box was not locked. These letters were put in and read; they were of the same character as the one sent to the prosecutor. Mrs. Collins said she was acquainted with the prisoner 13 years ago, and bad seen her write and was acquainted wih er handwriting. She had seen the letter received by the prosecutor, and she believed it to be the prisoner's hand- The prisoner, when asked if she desired to put any questions to this witness, replied, with very well affect inno. cence, that she did not think she had.ever seen her before in The witness said she knew her very well 13 years before. Prisoner.-Oh, 13 years ago ! What name did you go by, then, at that time? Witness.-Catherine Molony. E Prisoner.-Ab, now I do recollect something about you. 1(A laugh.) I Several other witnesses gave similar evidence as to their I belief that the letter in question was the prisoner's hand. Iwriting. ! The prisoner said that there were other letters found in h ber room by Thain, another officer, who accompanied Bull when the search was made, and she should wish those letters to be read. Mr. BODKIN said he had no objection to the production of any decunment that the prisoner might consider essential to her defence, and he called the officer Thain, who said that on searching the prisoner's room he found a letter addressed to Emily Taylor, a girl who had been in the prinsoner's employ, and another to a girl named Mary Anne Cowell, who had also been in her service. These letters were put in and read at the request of the prisoner. They contained a good deal of disgusting matter, but the object of the letters appeared to be to induce Emily Taylor and the other girl to make some statement against the prisoner, and also to prove that she was the author of the threatening letters. Thain, the officer, was recaleld, and, in answer to a question put by Mr. BODsIN, he stated that he had seen the prisoner write upon three occasions, and he had no doubt that both the letters that had just been read were written by herself. hrdfne e The prironer, when called upon for her defence, declared that there had been a conspiracy to get up this charge against her, and thatshe was entirely innocent of the offence, and she asserted that none of the letters were written bv er,b ut had been sent by other persons to get her into troubl. Emily Taylor and Mery Anne Cowelld the two girls ahtte rreistofd thoe lbprsonter,axnd they stated that they had certainly reoeived the letters that had been read, but it appeared that they immediately communicated with the prisoner and gave the letters to her. One of these witnesses also stated, in answer to a question put by Mt r BO , that while she was in the prisoner's service she frequently sent her to fetch wrtig-paper and postage stamps, end thet shie used to he writing for hours together in an adjoining Mr. Baron WATSON then summed up, and The jury' retired to deliberate. In about 25 minutes they returned into court, and gave a vcrdict of Guilty. The prisoner declared that she was jnnocent, and that the letters were not her handwriting. X y, BODxin said he thonght it right to st&te that bun' dreds of these abominable letters had been seat to different persons, and that since the prisoner had been In custody the practise had entirely cease& The learned JUJDG:E, in passing sentence, said that he en-. tirely concurred in the verdict that had been delivered by thejuy, and there could be no doubt on the mindj of any one who had heard the evidence that the prisoner had for a long time been carrying on this disgraceful traffic. The offence was one of the most odious description, the law had affixed a very serious punishment to it, and he felt that he should be neglecting his duty if he did not inflict the full sentence appointed by the statute for such a crime, which was that she be transported beyond the seas for the term of her natural life.

The circumstances of this case, so far as they admit of being made public, appeared to be these :-The dece3sed Mary Bingham, at the time of her death was about a rs of age, and the wife of an assistant warder in the hElbarnkPrison. She was in the familyway with her seventh child, and early on the morning of the 30th of April, in oonsequence of indications of her being speedily confined coming on, she sent for a midwife of considerable experience in the neighbourhood, named Fisher, and she came to her and assisted her in her delivery until nearly 12@oclock, when the infant appeared to have been partially brought into the world, At this time there appeared to be no doubt that the child was dead, and Mrs. Fisher, finding herself incompetent to deal with tho case, sent to Mr. Morgan and requested him to attend, and he did so immediately; and it appeared that he expressed an opinion that nothing more could be done, and that nature would complete the operation. The poor woman continued in great agony, but Mr. Morgan saw her several times, and appeared to have done all that lay in his Dover under the circumstances to relieve her, and at a late hour of the night another medical gentleman was called in and he succeeded in removing the infant by the aid o' instrumensa and it was then found that the difficulty of she birth bad been occasioned by malformation of the body of the infant. The deceased was in a very exhausted stat and she continued in that condition for three days, when she died, and upon a post mortem exination it was dis covered that the womb was in a state of mortiication, and that this had caused the death, and it was alieged that th circumstances connected with the delivery had occasioned this condition of the womb, the sgestiu n on the part of the prosecution being that therea ben neglect on the part of the prisoner m not resorting to the use of Snstru. ments earlier in the day, and also that he had resorted to improper violence to bring the child into the world, and that from these combined causes the death of the deceased had been occasioned. Mrs. Hunt, the landrady of the house where the deceased lodged, and th6 midwife, Mrs. Fisher, were examined, and they proved most ofthe above facts. Mrs. Fisher, hQwever, stated positively that she saw no violence madd use of by Mr. Morgan, and that he acted with great hindnies and attention to the deceased and visited her several thrnes, stating that he had left a very serious and important case that was under his charge to visit the deceased. It also appeared that Mr. Morgan 'ore a high character in the neighbourhood for his skill, and also for his lind treat. ment ot hispatients. - Mr. Robert Ne%gs, the gentleman who ultimately per. formed the operation of removing the child, detailedthe course of proceeding he adopted, and said that the case was a difficult one undoubtedly, owing to the malforma. tion of the infant; but he was of opinion that the use of instruments ought to have been resorted to earlier. Mr. Baron CHANNELL here interposed, and said he really did not see how the jury could find a verdict of manslaughter upon this evidence. It was not sufficient to make out that there had been an error of judgment, but there must be evidence of gross negligence and want of skill to justify the jury in returning a verdict of manslaughter against a medical man under such circum. stances. Mr. DOYLE said he felt that the evidence was certainly very weak. Mr. SLEGIH said he hoped the Court would allow him to state that 20 or 30 witnesses were in attendance to speak to the skill and humanity that had characterized Mr. Morgan throughout the whole of his professional career. Baron Csex,1LL said he must confess that he could not see any evidence to support the charge. The jury at once returned a verdict of NPot Guilty, and the defendant was ordered to be immediately discharged. NEW COURT. (Before the CoseoN SEizAssN,) Gustave Hahn, 23, musician; Arnold De Grintfer, 26, watchmaker; Eerman Babmer, 18, clerk; and Philip Worff, 36, shoemaker, were indicted for stealing 18 pices of American cloth and 36 calfskins, the property of Louis Morrice Bachrack, the master of Bahmer. Mr. Sleigh and Mr. B. Smith proseeuted,. and Mr. W. Cooper appeared for Bahbaer. It appeared from the evidence, which lasted a considerable time, in consequence of its having to be interpreted to the prisoners, all of whom are Germana, that the prosecutor is a merchant, carrying on business at 28, Clement's-lane, city. The prisoner Bahmer was his clerk, and had been so for about five months. Upon the evening of Saturday, the 2d of May, after the prosecutor had left and business was over, the prisoner Bahmer came to the warehouse, and said to the porter, "Give me the key ;" this the porter did, and Bahmer, after being there some short time, came out, and said, " If a man comes here for some goods, let him have them." He then went away, but upon a lad named Moore, one of the witnesses, coming to the warehouse a few minutes afterwards, Bahmer came back, and, looking at a letter brought by Moore, purporting to be an order for the delivery of goods, said it was all right, and that the porter was to let the lad Moore have the goods, which was done, and they went away. Upon Monday another order came brought by the father of the lad Moore, %ho is also a German, and the prosecutor, having by that discovered the fraud, gave Moore into custody. Moore teen stated that the prisoners Hahn and Grintfer and Worff had e ad him to deliver the order, and gave information wha ged to the apprehension of those three prisoners. Subsequently Bahmer went to his employer, the prosecutor, and coafessed the part he had taken in the matter, entreated his mercy, and said he had been led into it by the others and that they were going to LiverpooL The evidence against the other prisoners, which was very lengthy, proved that they had all of them taken an active part in getting the goods in question, which they had pawned upon the same evening upon which they had obtained them, and had also directed the elder Moore to go with the second forged order for the delivery of goods. The jury found them all Guilty. Mr. CooPER, upon behalf of the lad Babmer, urged that he had been led into the offence by the other prisoners. Mr. SLEIGH said that Worff had pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with having got from the prosecutor 11. under the pretence that he would get him back his goods, but had, in fact, done all he could to frustrate the ends of justice. The CouRT then sentenced Worff to six years' penal servitude, Grintfer to four, Hahn to 18 months' imprisonment, and Bahmer to three. THIRD COU7RT (BefOre Mr. PRENDERGAST, Q.C.) The greater portion of the day in this court was ocoupied in trying the remainder of the Mint cases, The committals were 28. The evidence given did not disclose any fact of sufficient public importance to warrant a report. Several of the prisoners were convicted of passing bad fourpeuny pieces, of which there seem to be a good many in Crcu- tion. Alfred Dowers, 25, labourer, was indicted for stealing a mare, valued at 121., the property of Henry MarshalL Mr. P. Salter prosecuted, and Mlr. Ribton defended. The prosecutor is a farmer at Acton, and the mare in quaestion had been turned out on the 26th of May upon OId Oak Common. Upon the following evening the prisoner, who is a peculiar looking mrn, with one eye, came and in the presence of some lads mounted the mare and rode her off, and upon the same evening the prisoner was seen at a beershop in Paddington upon a mare answering the de. secription of the one stolen. The mare had not been traced and prisoner was not taken until some dave afterwards, and that in consequence of the description given of the prisoner to the police. The jury found him 'UiVty. He was again indicted for stealing a mare, valued at 18., the roperty of George Leggatt. The prosecutor in this case lived at Egham, and the mare in question had been stolen from a field there upon the night of the 30th of November of last year, the prisoner being sworn to as having been seen in the field upn that night. Mr. Leggatt saw nothing of his horse until e 9th of this month, when it was stopped at Egham in the cart of a tradesman named Osborne, living in London, who at the time was going down to enjoy the Ascot Races. The account given by Osborne was that he had bought it of the prisoner, whose remarkable countenance he described to Superintendent Biddlecombe. The superintendent upon this came to town with Osborne, and not knowing that prisoner was in charge were about making inquiries, but going mto a house forisome refreshment they there saw in the paper the account of the prisoner's examination at Hammersmith Police-court upon the other charge, and hispeculiar descrip. tion at once convinced thom that he was the man, and the result was their going to the House of Detention, and prisoner being picked out from among above 100 other prisoners. Mr. RiBTON, after hearing the evidence, declined offer. ing any defence, and prisoner, being again founel Guilty, was
AIIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Wednesday, June 17. (Before Mr. PAsrnEy, Q.C., Assistant-Judge.) Henry Price, 12, was indioted for stealing caps, value 15s., theproperty of James Shipway, his master; and Edward William Harrison, 25, was indioted for feloniously receiviDg the same, well knowing them to have been stolen. Mr. Tindal Atkinson, instructed by Mr. Wakeling, prose. cuted ; Mr. Platt appeared for Harrison. The prisoner Price pleaded " Guilty." Mr. ATKISo having opened the case, Price was placed in the witness-box and sworn. He sail -I am 12 years of age. I was errand-boy to hMr. Shipway, and had assisted in his shop for about four months. Mr. Shipway's shop is in Upper-street, Islington. I know the prisoner Harrsson, and have taken things to him from may master's shop. I began to do so about three weeks after I went into his service. Mr. Sbipway gave me and another boy some old hats, and we sold them at Hanison's shop, in Wheatsheaf-yard, Ielington. He then told me if Icouldbrin him some caps he would pay me well for them. I did noW tell him where I lived, but he saw from the name inside the hats where I worked. I took several caps after he asked me, but I cannot exactly say how many. I took a cap the next morning out of a box in my master's shop, which I took to Harrison, and he gave me 6d. for it. The selling price of the cap was 2a. 6d. I took another cap the next day from a shelf in the shop, which was worth S& 6dL, and Harrison gave me 8a. for it. The next day I 'took aaother cap; it wa4 a two-and-sixpenny cap, and he gave me 6d. for thaL I took two half-crown caps the next day, and Harrison gave me ls. for the two. The day after that I took two more cap, and sold them to Hrrison at the same Frioe. On other days I took several more ca. and Harrison gave me 6d. each for them. I stole all the caps from my master. I took this one (produced) in May last (The witness then identified some other caps he had eold to the prisoner Harrison.) I met Harrison in the Oity-road two or three days after a polioeman had been to my master's Ehop, and he said, " How is it that I have not seen you so long ?" and I said that as I had seen a policeman come to my master's shop I was frightened to take any more caps. Harrison said that he would see that liwas right, an dhe then left me. After that I took some more caps and leather bands, which I sold to the prisoner. Cross-exanilned by Mr. PLATr.-My master has not told me what to say. HIe only told me to speak the tuth. I do not expect to get off through glving evidence, but I de not expect to be so severely punished. I took two caps sometimes toether from my master's shop. I do not know the price of ese caps per dozen. I did not tell Harrison when I took the caps that I had been sent by my mother to sell them, who was very busy making them. X have taken altogether about 70 caps to Mr. Hariison's shop. Harrisoa once gve me lOd. for a cap, but the price of that was 4s. 6d I have never been in trouble in my life before. Mr. James Shipway, the prosecutor, of No. 89, Upperstreet, Islington, said the boy Price had been in his service for about four months. From information he received he watehed him. On Saturday, the 9th of May, he called Price into his counting-house, and told him that he had been robbing him for some time. He took acap out of his desk, and asked him if he knew it. He said he did, and ad mitted that hehad stolen it. He began too , and said he shotld not have done so had he not been induced to do so by a man in Wheatsheaf-yard. He said the man had given him 8d. for the cap. He also said that he had taken a good many caps, leathers, and other things. Otherevidence having been given, Mr. PLaTT addressed the jury, contending that Harrison had received the caps under misrepresentations by Prices that his mother had made them, and being in distress was compelled to sell them at a sacrifice. A witness was called to contradict the boy, and evidence to character was given. The jury found Harrison Guilty. The prosecutor very kindly said, if the Courb would allow him to take the boy Price back into his employment at once he would do so, to afford him stRn achance of returningto paths of honesty and becoming a good man. The Assxs;TA 4JDGE said hat was very creditable on the prosecutor's part, and to enable him to endeavour to cry out his good intention he should sentence the boy to t,hree days' imnprisonment, which having already expired, dating from the commencement of the session, he would be at once dlscharged and given up to his friends;* and the ceril he had been rn-for he wfas liable to be transnorted for 1 years for the offence he had committed-would, be hoped, be a warning to him for the rest of his life. With respect to Harrison the case was a very bad one, but bethought he conld properly abstain from sentencing him to penal servi tude. Under the oircumstances of his case, and taking perhaps a too lenient view, he should sentence him to be kept to hard labour for 15 calendar months. John Weet was indicted for having stolen a truss of hay, the property of Henry Hawker. r. GXent prosecuted; Mr. S. Carter appeared for the prisoner. The prosecutor is a hay-dealer living at Harmondsworth, and the prlsoner kept a publichouse at Crauford-bridge, Hounslow * the former bought a rick of hay of the latter, whichl was uon his premises. The case against the prisoner was that he had purloined some of the hay after it became the property of theprosecutor. When accused of the theft the prisoner acnowledged it, and said he hoped he should not be locked up. The jury, after a long investigation, found the prisoner usity, bUt recommended him to meroy on account of his former high character. The ASSISTANT JjDGE sentenced him to three months' hard labour.

CRANWORTH, Chancellor.
POLICE. Gu rAmr.-Charles Harrison, a foreman in the employ of Messrs. Cooper, wholesale grooera, of Monument. yard was placed at the bar before Alderman HALc for futher exmination relative to the charge of robbing his employers. Mr. Humphreys appeared for the proseution, and fr. Wontuer for the defence. From the evidence taken on the former examination it appeared that the prisoner had been a foreman in Mess, Cooper's establishment durlng the last six years, andthat in such capacityit wa a part of his duty to draw orders unpon the sugar refiners for the delivery of loaf sugar, it being customary with Messrs. Cooper to purchase large quantities of refined sugar, to be cleared within stated periods, and they were in the habit of removing it in such quantities as were required from time to time. The prisoner had taken advantage of the authority placed in his hands, and had issued orders upon the refiners for large quantities of loaf sugar, and it was alleged that the sugar so obtained was sold to different parties by the prsoner on his own account, but in his employerse name, none of xuch transactions being entered in the prosecutors' books. In one instance Mr. John Anstey, a grocer, of High-street, Hoxi;ca, produced about 30 invoices of goods nurcdased of the prisoner, amounting to about 1801., and which Anstey believed he was buying of Messrs Cooper. The following was the evidence taken yesterday:- Peter Mossop said,-I am derk to Messrs. Elers and Morgan, sugar refiners, of Iambeth-street, Goodman's-fields. On the 22d of May I received the order produced for 40 titlers of sugar. It was signed "C. Harrison, for Thomas Cooper and Co.," and directed that the goods should be delivered to Johnson's cart. Johnson's carman brought me the order, and I wrote upon it requ esting instructions about the pacldng of the sugar, aond shortly after the carman returned wmth the prisoner, who told me to deliver the sug¢ar in white pa,per,and I did so. The weight of the 40 Cross-examiined.-Mesars, hlers and Morgan sold this sugar toMessrCooper, andit waspart of a lot of 803 titlers which Mepurched on the 19th of May, to be cleared in two montgs, Robert Stewart, carman to Mr. Johnson. said,-I went to Messrs. Elers and Morgan on the 22d of May last, for 40 titers of sugar, and the prisoner went with me and told me I was totale in 40 titlers, and he remained with me until they were all put into the carL Hle told me to take them to Mr. Durant's in Liypot-lane, and I accordingly delivered them there to a porter named Blatch. On the 2ith of llay I went to Mr. Dnrants for 35 titlers and a bag, which Blatch brought out to my cart, and I took them to Chamberlain's wharf, accompanied by Blatch. Henry Frederick Blatch said,-I am in the service of Messrs. Durant, of Lillypot-lane. The firm consists of Roger Durant and Ryder Dlurant. They are wholesale grocers and dealers in spices. I was present on the 22d of Ma, when the last witness brought 40 tltlers, and I delivered them to Ryder Durant, who stacked them in the warehouse. I assisted. They were all in white paper. Some of them were put in one stack, and some with other sugar. There were from 20 to 25 titlers in a stack. I went with the last witness to Chamberlain's-wbarf with 35 titlers, and they were mixed with otbers, but I cannot say If the 35 taken to Chamberlain's-wharf include the stack of 20 or 25, but I believe part of them were part of those taken to Chamberlae-wh Iput blue paper round them by direction of Mr. Ryder Durant, but Mr. Roger Dnrant was not then present. I took a big with the titlers and an address card, directed " From Roger Durant and Co., 5, Lillypot-lane. GeneralPostoffice, London.-B. Atwill, 95, Lower umion-street, Torquay. Roger Durant wrote the card and receiving note produced. The memorandum, containing the followig entries, is in my handwriting:- June 2. "To the Superintendent, OhAbrainb whagf-please ship on beasd the -. for Torquay, the undermentloned goods-viz., 31 titler,, 1 hag sundries 1 bag curranm and 1 parcel tea. Form . -AtwilL. L werUnlon-street, Torquay. "yrem R. Durat and Co.. 5, Llllhpt-isne, Noble-street, eity." Since the last examaination I have ascertined that Mr.Ryder Dorant is not one of the firm. Ee is only a servant, the same as myself, and is peaid wreekly. Alderman HTAI&-ho, then, is the Co. ? Witness.-I do not know. Mr. Ryder Durant told me taty he wasenotoneofthefi, I have not heard so from Hr. Humphreys.-How is it that the name of "W. Mitchell, 5, Lillypot-lane," appears 5n print on the back of the receiving note? Mr. Wontner objeced to the question as irregular, as it did not refer either to the prisoner at the bar or anything written by the witness. It merely related to something done by a third party after the goods had left the prisoner's possesson. Alderman HALE thought the answer might be materiaL Witness.-The name of Mitehell was over the window when I first went into Darant's service, but I have never seen Mr. Mitchell, neither do I know how long his name remained up. I know a person who acted on the premises and used the name of Mitchell. Mr. Ryder Durant was there when I first went, and he took possession of and opened all letters addressed to MlitchelL I read some of them, and I have taken orders in MtiehelPs name to Messrs. Cooper's for goods. Mr. Ryder Durant attended to the business referred to in those letters. The orders I took to Messrw Cooper's I received from Mr. Ryder Durant. Mr. Wontner objected to this mode of examination, as it was quite irrelevant to the charge against Harrison. Alderman HsA E said, if other parties were concerned with Harrison in this extensive robbery, it would ultimately be seen how the evidence affected him. Mr. Humphreys said Mr. Cooper had given him such information and instructions that he now felt justined in giving Mr. Ryder Durant and Mr. Roger Durant into custody for receiving this property, knowing it to have been The two Durants were then placed in the felons' dock, and the examination proceeded. Peter Mossop, realed, said,-I have been to Chamberlain'-wharf and seen the titlers. Some had my own private marks on the white papers they were packed in, and others had not. I unpacked those in white paper, which I exasuined, when found that the marks indicating the quality of the sugar had been rubbed off the bottom of each titler. .r. Humpbreys, at this stage of the proceedings, said he thought he had stated sufficient to ask for a further remand to enable him to complete the case. A solicitor, on the part of the two Durants a plied&that all letters, papers, and keys found upon them =e given up to them. Alderman HTAE said it was ratharV`unusual applica tion, as it mighttend to frstrat.ieds of justice. However, the officers would exaMte those papers, and if there wa nothing in them relating to the present charge, the appliication might be renewed upon a future day. lTheprisoners were all remanded to Newgate. BOWV-STsM.--John Samuel Taylor, a youth of about 18 years of age, apprentice to Messrs. Garrard and Co., silversmiths, Panton-street, H aymarket, was charged with steal. lug 24 ounces of silver plate, ths property of his masters, and George Salter, shop'oy to a bootmakerin St. Martin'slane, was charged with receiving it. The prisoners, who beth admitted their guilt, were fully committed for trial at the sessions. MALnBoRouGH.sTRm .-For W. Bray and his idiot family, "Pechene" has sent 10s.; "Anon.," lOs.; and "Slaidburn," 10s. MARYLEBONE.-Wiiam Drage, a coachman in the service of Lady Listowell, residing at Kingston-house, K3nightsbridge, was charged before Mr. BRtouGnToON with most violently assaulting William Eastwood, a cab driver, in the Edgeware-road. The complainant stated, that between 1 and 2 o'clock that day (yesterday) he was going down the Edgeware-road driving a four-wheeled cab, in which he had two passengers. He saw the prisoner, who was on horseback, before him, and endeavoured to pas him. In doing so the fore-wheel of his cab touched thehind quarters of his (prisoner's) horse. He (complainant) went on. In a few minutes he was followed by the prisoner, who gave him a violent blow on his head with the butt end of his whip. He instantly fell back in his seat, and was insensible for a few minutes. Dr. M. M'Cormack, surgeon, Bedford, stated that he Wa in an omnibus when he saw the cab pass. It was goin about four miles an hour. He saw the prisoner pass, and remarked to a passenger, seeing how he was riding, that he thought he was either a bad rider or intoxicated. He saw the fore wheel of the cab touch the horse. The Drisoner rode up to the complainant and gave him a desperate blow with the butt-end ofihis whip on shishead, and a quantity of blecd immediately1flowed from the{wound. Witness got out of the omnibus and sized hold of the horse. Witness observed to him, "Why did you commit such a violent assault when you were in fault?' By Mr. BROIJGIITON.-After the eomplainant was struck he ell on hia seat, and was in a state of insensibility for a few minutes. I thought he was dead. I cannot say what the result may be, but I am of opinion that he ought to have the advice of some medical gentleman. I thought it a most violent and unprovoked assault, and coms forward on publc grounds. I am obliged to leave town immediately. Police-constable D 171, who took the prisoner into custody, said that the head and face of the complainant who gave him (prisoner) in charge, were coverad with blood The prisoner sad that he did not mean to hurt the complainant. He was held to ball, himself in 501., andi two sureties in 401. each, to appear at the court on Wednesday next IA1NLErH.-Mr. Thomas Pearce, of the firm of Pearce and Watling, successors to Mr.Robson inL the business of antimony smelters on premises in Bowling-green-street, Kennington-comion, appeared before Mr. i330oTr to answer a summons charging them with carrying on a busness which, according to the certificate of the medical officer of health for the parish, caused a most intolerable nuisance inx the neighbouirhooa. The sTummos Was taken out under that useful and salutary Act the 8th amd 19th Victoria, chap. 121, the 27th section of which enacts that,- ," Any candle-house. meltng-hue, meltngplace orsoap-house or :cefor boiling offal or blood, or for boling, burning, or crushin _____e n orothermufactory. bhuldng. or place used for any trade butiness, po r maznuacture caudng efduvia be at any timie certified t^ theoaauthe borit y any mnedical officr or any two legaly qualified medical Practitloner to be a nluince or Inunous to the health of the inbabitant of the neiglbourhood, the icCal authority shall direct oomplaint to be made beforeanjustice who may summon before him Tshe person by. or In whose behaf, the Wcrkasocom(nlainedof re Caiedon; andsuch Justlceahallinquire Into sch oompla t andif it sball appear to such Justise that the rad, or businewcaeon is a nuisnoce, or casay effluvia injurious to the ealth of the Inhabitants of the nelhbourood, and that such penron shall not have used the beat practiable means for abating such MulanOe, O reating or counteractng such effluvia, the peccn so offendingsa, uT oul ootloi_n, forfsuch ofieit and wa sum of not more than u.orse than a seoDnd o on aon for such offencete sum Oor1 ,=o rnafor each zsb'equent convictiec a sum double the amont of the PenaImDosed on we lst preo g oossvletiD, buLt sh ibo mun fuc e alt lAnot in aul cas exceed the sum of AM" It wil be seen that the provisions in the above clause are sufficiently strong for the suppresion of all dangerous and disgreeable nuisane, but, unfortunately for the inhabitants of the metropol*, and other largely populated cities and towns, for whomr the provisions of the cause should be preserved intact, another clause was allowed to slip in at the end of the Act, w chichitisfesred,inthis and other instanoes, will deprive the inhabitants of that summary and speedy justice which such cases demand, and throw themTaok on the slow and unertain remedy by indictment, so that, by the id of a shifty lawyer and the eTnal law's delays, a whole neighbourhood may be tortured and stifled, if not sony olSoned, before the nuisace Di got- rd of.

Boffee, the ves=yelcrk of Lambeth parish, by whon& the suons hd been taen out, attended to support it by birection of the vetry. Af atr sating the nature of the n ce and putting_ a certificate irom hMr. Odling, the officer of heator th paa, and upon which the pro. ceedings were taken, he sid that in addition to the testimony of that gentlemn- he should sall two pect- able inhabitants of the neigh'ourhood, all of whom. would show that the nuisance complaned of was oee of an intolerable and daugerous description, and called for imme. diate suppression. Mr. William Odling vwa here sworn, and sid he wai medical officer of healthfor tho paxish of Lambethi, aini was well aquainted with the premises of the defenza ants, in Bowing-green-Street, Kennington-cros. He had frequently visited those premises, and saw them emit a white smoke, containing a quantity of suphur. o ts acd, which was a nuisance, and injuzious to the health of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, and no means had been taken to prevent it. The nuisance might be diminished, if not altogether abated, by i means which he (Mr. Odling) could suggest. The mann factory itself was a smelry of antimony, and the effiuvium emitted from the premis was a nuisance and deddedly dangerous to health. In answer to a question from the do. fendant, the witnes admitted that there was a similar mnanufactory in Broad-wal, in the pariah of Christ Church, Blackfriars, in a crowrded locality, and that hebadnot heard any com plaints abount it. The writness also acknowledged that he had sometlmes visited the defendants' preo mises, and had not pereived nthing of an unpleuant nature. Mr. Pearce, the defendant, acknowledged that on one, or perhaps two occasions, an effiuvium of an unpleant descrip. tion might have been oocasioned, but that was by their foreman throwing the buakets or paccages in which the anti. mony oil was imported on the fire, but this should never occur again, as the ma had received partioular orders on. the subject. Dr. Prse'l, a medical gentleman resing in Harleyford-place, Kesrnington-road, said that the premises of the defendants approxiated to his, and he quits agreed in opinion with Dr. Odling that the manufactory was a very great nuisance, and highly injurious to thehealthoftheinhabitants For his own part, he could say that he suffered very severely from it. His house was frequently filled with a vapour which perfectly poisoned it, end when it disappeared it seemed to have left behind ont the walls a portion of its noxious gas, which lasted for days. One night in particular the nuisance was so great that he (Dr. Pursell) coughed incessantly. The injurious effect of the gases emitted from the defendans premises was most perceptible in his (Dr. Pursell's) garden. There the colour of the grass, the trees, aud shrubs was completely changed, and vegetable life seemed destroyed. That morning he had called the attention of Dr. Odling to the gooseberries and currants growing in his garden, and showed him that they were so injured as to be perfectly destroyed and dropping off. In conclusion, Dr. Pursell said that serious com lsints had been made to him by many of his patients of the nuisance and Its pernicious effect on them and he perfectly agreed wih the officer of health for the parish that such a nuisanoe should not be permitted to exist in such a neighbonrhood. The factory, he said, hsd origi. nated with Mr. Robson, of Crystal Palace fraud notoriety. The defendant complained of this observation, which he said was used for the purpose of creating a prejudice. Dr. Pursell denied any such intention, and obeerved that he was about to mention to his worship that even in Rob. son's time the premises were a nuisance, and he for one was about to have proceedings taken against him at the time he took to flight, and it was only that circumstance which prevented his doing so. Mr. Artins, a tradesman residing in the vicinity of the defendants' premises, described the nuisance as most intolerable. About 10 nights ago his servants rushed into his room at n o'clock, and complained of being almost suffocated, and he himself was not much better. In the daytime he had fequently to apologize to his customers whilr in his shop for tnenuisance, which was of so disgusting a nature that it was as much as they could do to stop while they gave their orders The defendant said that a part of the time of which this witness acompJained they were not at work at alL He also denied that his premises were more a nnisance than thoss inBroadwall, and said he should be able to produce ierfectlcompetent witnesses to contradict the testimony givenL on toat day. Mr. Roffee remarked that, whatever mi;,ht be the zesult of the present proceedings, he had the directions of the vestry to prefer an indictment against the defendants. Mr ELo, without giving any opinion on the case at present, adjourned it for a week.
