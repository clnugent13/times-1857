Th mportance of ibis line wil be heat understood from the fact that it h as aleady been examined and reported on by the Deputy. Consulting Engineer to the Government of India, CaPtain Yule,.sad Its censtructon urged by the authorities of the province, In reference to this, Captain Yule ears In his report,II.&coDmplete line of raliway, extendingt from nhahiebanpoor, would then connect, in a space of 110 miles, the town of Sbahielanpoor (with a Population of 76000), Barell ( 1200) ,Rarpoor (probably 310.00~, ioradaba (6eWUmroha I NWO, I . eerot 140,000). and 40 mIles further, Delhi 15 I000).-a string of populousplaces which is rarely to be found inx the same coarpam."
Subsequently. it. is propoced to extend It in a north-westerly dirwction by war of bloozuffurnugger and Saharunpoor to the great military station of UmbOalla with a branch by the Government wrorks at Roorkee to Huridwar, the' Nlhnl-NoTgorod of India. At the celebrated fairof IIurdwar merchants congregate, not only from everypea of India, but from the mnost distant ris of Central and Northern Ari, n sud isuch crowds that the num~e of visitors is estimated, at times, to equal the population ofLondon. The linesto Hurdwar would also be the grat co.umunlcatico betwecen India and the western pert of Thibet, as well asian outlet for the tea of Debra Doon, and the timber of the lower Himalayas. From Umballab, the line wil con. tinue north-west through Loodheana to Urerirair, whore it will join the runjaub Railway; thus connecting the railway systemu of the Indus and the Ganges.
So-athward from ShebJehanpoor, abou:d it eventually bo deemed desirble by the authorities, the line would run through the recenLtly acquired territory of Oude vilt Luckcnow to Benare, where the Ganges Is permanently deep, and capable of floating powerful steamers, even tinthe "rest reasons, down to Raimnahal. Thus, an altemarnae lies would he offered for the convejanes of troops and storesto the- north,, west frontier, a strategic advantage of which it isrdifficultto exaggesate the Political importamce.
Such portions of lbs line as are required for beafTytTalf1Io wirbe formed of a substantial character. It has been estimated that the cost of oonatrmctingulo portion will exceed £8,800 per mille, suidsalarge portion wiLll not exceed one-baif that amount.
Theo first portion of the line intended to be constmected wil be about 200 mi!es,-nammely, from Fattinyhur to Delhi v1ift Shabjehanpoor, Bareilly,and Moradabad. For the completion of thissecton the estimated capital will be sutficient.
The syctem intended tu be introduced will be mnore suitable to the actual requIrements of the country than lines costing £9,000 to £10,000 per mile. The present rate of trasvelUlng in India by camels and carts aeldem amounts to 50 miles Per week. If, therefore. So miles per day can e acomlised llsobvoushewgret aboon wrn be conferred upo Idia O sus syte ths inewoldbe not only the model, but he fuitll prent By alabtohaca onneienwitht the iron distict, ad b It inxpesivecontmutle deeloinglocal trafice in pars ufited or erecoslywors, t wuldnotonl at uas ameet Imprtat nd ibralfedertothelies lradyincourse of construe-

The construction of thstrnmroad wll ha rendered very cheap by rca ounof the facility for dr-awng timber iuSny quantity rom the nad. jacent forests at the foot of the Himalayas and ultimately the COm. Dany expect to'obtain a large porilon of their Sron forrails at ssrednctlon of one-half the present cost f'romn the recentlydiscovered iron mines of Eumaon, vhere Iron weorks have been already commeneed. But the estimates for the line have In the mean tlime beenbaed upon the suppostilon that the iron will have to bobroughtout from England.
The Comuany hope to complete the line, recommenoedbhy the deputy coneutinmg engineer to the G overnment of India, from liutesyghnr throngh ehasjeh,npoor, Baretily, Itampoer, lIoradabad, and heernt, to Delbi Sin ahout three or four years from the time of obtaninng the es3neton of ths authorities.

The Representation of Manchester.
!The RBEPBRESBNATION of AIANCH1ESTER.
A densel? crowded meeting of the friends and supporters of Mera Gibson and Bright as the representatives ef Manchester was held on Wednesday eyening in the
3xeetrade Hal There were about 6,000 persons present.. JIr. George Wilson presided, and there were present-Mi. Cobden, dP..; the Right Hon. T. XL Gibson, XYP.; Rev. br. Halley, Rev. Dr. M'Kerrow, Rev. Dr. Davidson,
mr6. T. Bazley, R. N. Phillips, J. A. Nicholls, W. B. Watkins, J. Sidebottom, . Plott, R. Stuart, J. Slagg, N. leald, F. Pennington, J. h. Kennedy, J. 0. Dyer, Edmund Ashworth, H. Ashworth, B. Syddall, W. M'Call, S. Leea, Theodore Schunck, S. Pope, Aldermen XLackie, Hervey, ind Heywood, Mr. J. Simpson, &c. The entrance of the
apeakers and their leading supportors was greeted with the inoet enthusiastic cheering.
The C.LntIUN said, this meeting had been drawn together because ox his right hand sat the gallant champion (great cheering) who from that ground carried the 'dag of free trde (reeewed cheering), who stormed the fortrems of monopoly, and made the name of Manchester famous throughout the world (cheers); while on his left
iand sat his rigbt hon. friend the member Tor that ctty. (Loud cheers.) It was now in their hands to say whether he should longer remain so. (Cries of " Yes," and "N o, he shan't J" followed by renewed cheering.) At all events there were now present 5,000 electors of Man. chester, or about ],500 more electors than the number said to be recorded at the last election against the present membo (Loud apelause, followed by three cheers for Mr. Gibson.) The cnairman then zead to the meeting a long letter from MIr. Bright to him (Mr. Wilson), which he said was in some degree private, hut which he would nevertheless communicate to them, as he always did and would communicate, faithfully, anything which came from lr. Br 'ht. (Loud cheers.) This letter, ho believed, would showvthem that a more single-hearted man did not exist in the whole ef Europe than their absent representative. (Loud cheers.) Ie resa it also because he would not take the responsibility of issauing the address of Mr. Bright without taking the Vounsel of the largest number of electors that could by any possibiabe collected together. (Cheers.)
* The ldlr was dated Rome, MbIarch 8, and in the course of at Mr. Brght, after alluding to his improved health and the dlilSolty in w;hich he had felt himself as to offering to stand again for Manchester, said,--
" Aftermuch onasideration 1 have cone to a couclusion in which reshape, nothing is abeolutely concluded, for after stating the case
irlY I must leave it in other bands. The interestof the constituency -that is, of the Liberl mxajrity-and the welfare of the Liberal cause must, in realty, decide the quest:on. Don't, for a moment even, put say feelings, or position, or prospects, in the scale against what is best tor tho Intereets aud tho reputation of the constituency of Manchester. if there is a with that I should stand as a candidate at this election, and Ifitbe thOught that the sometbing of uncertaityastomyhealth andmy unavoidable abeuce from Eagland at this moment -il not leveut my return if I am brought forward, then I am willing to offer
yselU for re-electio, Itf, on the cortrarym many persona should doubt mybeingable agai to reta to pubhlife, and it they Ehouldbe unwiling thatone of their rpress utattves should be ro lout *s:ent coron lhe House, and if they should aaow a coldness becausel am not Dresent to assist in the wcotest, and to such an extent as to make the election a difficult and a doubtful one, thee I think ou will do your duty to ce and the coetituency by not allowing my name te appear. I am ure you wMil decide for the best, and I haltoe entirely satisfied with the result. I Vaink you sobuld at oLce tale tome step to onsult a considerable tnumber of our most judicious frieuds; let them weigh the matter well; let them not dwell on personal considerations, and lt their deistion be ouch as can be sustained before the electors at large. .2. . Nowv, my dear Wilson, donlt be led to act simply out Of friendship to m0e. Do what Is wire sad just, and what aln our best fbends canfully seomndyou in. It is no small trouble tome not to be 'with you, and tobe excluded from taking any part in what is being dlone among younY (Loud cheers.)
%lr. GresoN, on presentirg himself, was received with great enthusiasm, the audience rising to cheer him. After some preliminary remarks, he said he was present to answer for his pubHc conduct. (Cheers.) He was not there to make mere professions for the future, but to give the electors of Manchester explanations as to the past, and to leave to them the consideration as to what should be done for the future. They were invited to dismiss from their service his hon. coUeague and himself. (Cries of
"Nover, never !") They were right in doing so if they had betrayed the principles they were elected to support, or if they had neglected to advance those views which they were sent to Parliament topromote. (Hlear.) What werethe charges against them? It had been said that they had neglected the localinterests; butwas that charge true? ("No !' andoheers.) He would ask the accusers to be definite in their accusations, and point out what particular measures had been neglected. (Cheers.) The Local Dues Bill had indeed been mentioned, but there were no men in theo House of Commons more desirous of giving to that bill their fuU and streauous sp. port than the members for Manchester. (Cheer!.) The
3measure was a Government Bill, managed by the Government in their own way, withdrawn by the Government in the midst of a debate, and consequently when an oppor. tunity could not have arisen for all parties to be heard in reference to it. (Cheers.) The representatives of Manchester were in their places ready to support by their voices and their votes that bill. (Loud cheers.) The debate was adjourned; and, with the concurrence of the town-clerk of Manchester and a deputation from the orcration, who were present in the House, it was thought desirable that they shonld defer their speeches to the next day, when the debate would be resumed, rather than attempt on the same evening, at a late hour, and before an exhausted House, to travel through the long arguments which were required totonfutethe tatements of Mtr. Rorsfall. (Cheer) As to the animosety of certain leading journals, he could not help attributing some of it to his course in reference to the abolition of the stamp on newspapers and of the advertisement duty, because that course had created the competition of a cheap press in the country (theers- which bid fair, in many parbs of this kingdom, to rval t old high-priced press of the country. (Laughter.) But he would ass the electors of Manchester whether the advocacy of a cheap press, diffusing knowledge over the iength and breadth of the land, was a poicy that it became vhe advocate of liberal principles to supporkt and whether they ouid see in the result of that policy anything but adTantage to the general interests of the community? (Loud cheers.) As to Mr. Lowe's candidature for Manchester, it Wad been said by oe of the prominent supporters of that gentleman that the electors eould not ex ect that r. LoI e would present himself to them, but be (ir. Gibson) caid if these gentlemen had got Nr. Lowe, w y did they not produce him? Were the electors to knowv nothing of his politics ? Had the electors ever seen him ? (Crie6 of "No, no.") He remembered in the borough of Sad.bury, in the county of Suffolk, a gentlemai was elected who had a great deal of black blood in his veins, though not the less respectable for that; hut he was elected in the way in which they used to oonduct those nattersinthe borough of JlAdbury-sincedicfranchised,-aud after he was pronounced the representative by the returning officer, an innocent-minded elector said,-" Would there be any ob3ection to miking an inquiry as to the hon. members p1olitics ?1" (Laughter.) He rather thought that if the views advocated in Mr. Garnett's paper were the views of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Lowe), they would not fincd favour with the great mnajority of the electors of Manoliester. (Great cheering.) Now, the sitting members were L.lso charged with thwarting the Government. Mr. Lowe said that aU who voted for the motion of his honourable friend the member for the West Riding (loud cheers) were actuated by a desire to get hold of the loaves and fishes. (Laughter.) It did not occur to him as being possible that the gentlemen of England sitting in the House of Commnons could vote according to their conscientious opinions.
ear.) At least Mr. Lowe could not charge him (Mr. ribsen) ith giving a vote against the Government in order to get a place (loud cheers) ; for when Ile held office in the Goverment, and found that the necessity of CalvAYS susporting the Government was not consistent with his uty to the electors of Manchester (cheers) he resigned that appointment. (Cheers,) Now, with regard to always supporting tie Government, was that so easy ? ("No ") Was Manehester to be a Government borough, like Portsmouth or Devonport, where the Government of the day nerally returned the members? (" No," and aproar.) Well, then, without being actuated by any personal animosity to the members of the present Government, the course which he had taken was simnly to give his vote and voice in support of those pncipfes of public policy which he in his couscience believed to be best calculated topromote the interests of the manufacturing districts. (Applause.j Then, with regard to foreign policy, what had been he ourse of his colleague and himself as to the Russianwar, for instance? Speaking for himself, he was then, as now, of opinion that that war might have been avolded. (Loud cheers.) But when the war had been undertaken-when the country had Willed that war should be-he would ask them whether they had evor opposed, in the House of Comoncas, the supplies which were necessary to be voted, or whether. they had ever taken part in any factious opposition to the military aDd naval armament of the country during tha continuance of that wsr? Nothinq of the kind. They knew that if a war was entered upon Lt could only be suncereully waged by the voting of large supplies. There was one question, however, in which they did undoubtedly to some extent interfere; it was when a proposition was made to go into foreign countries for the purpose of raising "oldiers in order to carry on the war. (Cheers, anId cries of LShamne!") I He warned the Government when that Bill was introduced, that they would get no effective aid from the soldis they, would so procure; while, on the other
nand, tney would run the risk of embroiling this country in serious disputes with friendly nations. (Hear, hear.) Did they not go to the United States in search of soldiers, contrary to the laws of that country; and what was the consequence? T'he British Minister was dismissed with contumely from that country ; and he (Mr. Gibson) believed
that nothing but the exertions of some of the meembe s for the Lancashire district (applause) prevented that palf,ry dispute about the enlistments in the United States frorrm ripen. ing into a most serious quarrel, even into a war wish America. (Rear1 hear.) Then, as to the China war, and 3Mr. Cobdens motion, they had not, as was imputed, intrude& themselves on the country on that question. The Government of the country bad called upon the House of Commons to endorse their poicy. They were bound to ivo their opinion according to the evidence which was laid ,nefore them. (Hear.) How many were there in the country who had been so glibly asserting that his hon. friendaiud his suppo were inthe wrong who hadnot read dn&wgliword of tle evidence which had been sunphed to Prliament? ? le Tinms recommended that peo> e should noIk'geek information on these questions (lond aughter); than they did not depend on facts. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Lowe had also said it was of no use quibbling about the nation. ality of a vesseL This reminded him (Mr. Gibson) of a certain barrister who was very anxious to convict a prisoner, and begged and entreated the jury not, on any account, to be biassed by the evidence. (Cheers and laughter.) He (Mr. Gibson) believed that if Commlssoner Yeh bad even done sll that was imputed to him there was no neces. ity, without reference to the home Government (hear, hear)-without any attempt to obtain redress from the Emperor of China-at once to proceed to thosw dreadful hostlities, and t4 endanger, not only the trade, but the lie, Fav pypveFtiq of91 all OU tfhlow.Q9ll?ltlmtg now wp4
dent at ftosglkong or in Chinah generally. (Applause.) He condehined that policy, mnd he believed tho end of such poliy'o would be that for year our intercourse with China would be more in eopardy than it had been, and that this dreadful act of bombarding a defenoeless population would leave behind it such feelings of bitter animosity as yeas of after commercial intercourse might not be able to wipe away. (Loud cheering.) He was as sensitive of the honour and indepence of his country as any Englishman 'in the land. If he saw the rigbts and independence of his country,
attacked, he would be the first to call to arms. (Cheers.). But he did not believe that these wars were in self-defence;' he believed they were got up for the purpose of keeping on foot a great and expensive establishment, and to distract the mind of this country from domestic reforms. (Cheers.) It was one thing to support a justand necessary war, and it was another thing to sa that every war was just and necessary. (Cheers.) Now he believed that the interest felt in the country in consequence of the division on the motion of his hon. friend Mr. Cobden (loud cheers) was this, that it was felt that this was the first time, perhaps, that P arliamont had asserted its independence (cheers), and had said to the Executive, "You have undertaken an unjust and unnecessary war." The princple they were endeavouring to maintain was, that the se of Commons had nothing to dd with wars, but that all they had to do was to supply the Ministry with taxes to carrythemon. Sotheysawthatthe war with Persia had been undertaken without the Ministers having told Parliament what it was about. Yet the money had been expended, and peaee had been made, but the people were at the present moment as completely innocent of the real merits of the question as if it had never occurred. (" Hear, hear," and cheers.) Now, he would ask if those who advocated the independence of Parliament were to be sneered down, and told, because they were independent, that they would sell their contry for pounds, shilings, and pence? (Cheers, and " No.") Why, then, was all this fuss about the recent vote? It was because the Government saw that a pginciple was at issue. The people had gained a Step it mignt not be a great one, but it was a step in the rigZV direction. (" Hear, hear," and loud cheers.) England was great enough end powerful enough among the nations of the earth not to be afraid to avow that it would be guided by judges in its relations with forei;n States. (" Hear,'t and cheers.) Had they anything to gain in the way of glory by slaughtering defenceless inihbitauts of a large and populous commercial city ? (' No, no PI) Could it be said that the House of Commons, in givlng the recent vote, was actuated by fear? No, it was a sense of justice. (Cheers.) That vote did honour totheParliamentof England. (Loudcheers.)
Mr. T. Ba7zLY moved,-
I That the gratefu thanks of this meeting be given to the Ilght Hon. Thoma Milner Gibson and Thomas ]rMht, Esq., for the faithful
and unflinching fideity to the principles to represent wbich they we"e. sent to Parlniment; and that this meeting pledges iteelf to use all la
ful means again to return them to the Houme of COmmon.o" (Loud applause.)
Mr. W. B. WATxRs seconded the resolution, which was carried with about five dissentients.
Mr. CoBDnIL, MLP., was received with protraeked cheering. He said,-I appear before you on this occasion as the humble: representative of my friend Mr. Bright (three cheers were here given for Mr. Bright), and in his name I thank you for the all but unanimous vote with wlich you have announced his candidature at this election. Now, I appear before yeu on the present occasion under circumstances which I certainly never expected to encounter again. Ihave on formeroccaslonsfoundmynameprominently associated with measures in the House of Commons and ia the country that have led to dissolutions of Parliament and to the faU of Ministries. That was when I was connected with the movements in which our object was to cause dissolutions of Parliament and destruction of Ministmies. For three times, I believe, Parliament has been dissolved arising out of questions with which my name was promineutly connected, but I certainly never did expect to see again a dissolution with which I should be associated. Now, what re the circumstances under which this has arisen? On the assembling of Parliament we found ourselves engaged in two wars, the one with an em!pire of 350,000,000 people, with a territory about eig t times as great as that of France and alout ten times the population; tho other was with Persia, another of the most ancient empires of the world. Parliamt nt and the people had had no voice in declaring these wars; troopswere movingfromlndia to Bushire, troopewere movinrg from Ceylon toHongkong, and war was going on at your expense, and you had had no voice in declaring that war. (H ear, hear.) On the assembling of Parliament a demand was made from the Ministry for information respecting the Persian war. The answer we got was, that it would be contrary (it is the stereotyped answer), that it would be prejudicial to the interests of the country that any papers should be given referring to the origin of the Porsian var. But I found on the table of the House of Commons all the papers baving reference to the Chinese war, and it is a very rare thing, indeed, that we are so fortunate as to find such a record of what is going on in our name and behalf. I read those papers, as I was in duty bound to do, and, coming to the conviction that the origin of this war was a blunder and a crime (A Voice. - No ."and enthusiastic shouts of" Yes, yes !"), 1 fran ed a resolution, which I showed to my right hon. friend hec, and asked him if he would like to second it; and, without consulting any other human being (cheers), I put that motion on the paper of the House of Commons, and it lay there for a fortnight before my turn came for bringing on the motion. Singular tosay-foritis an unusual thing-not one word of that resolution was altered to accommodate the mind of any member of the House of Commons. (Cheers,) Well, I am told-and we hear it daily repeated in the columns of some of the London papers, whoso audacity of assertion certainly sometimes astounds *me, even though I am habituated to the perusal of 2ite Tese newspaper (laughter); there is it still every day the reiterated falsehood, as if the people had not yet had enough of it-that this was a motion brought forward in a factious spirit, and with a coalition of part%te, in order, forsooth, that we might overturn the Government and get possession of their places. (Laughter.) Well, now, there isa Kreat question involved in this, which I think the eople of this country ought to take very much to heart. Do you want the members of the House of Commons to look after your interests and watch the expenditure ? ("1 Yes, yes"), and to guard you from getting into needless and expensive wars? (" Yes.") Well, but you are not going the right way to work, if what I learn in your newspapers is going to be verified in the course of this election; forI am told that those members who joined in that vigilant care of your interests, and voted according to the evidence before us on the question of that war, are all to be ostracizedsent into private life-and that you are going to send up other men ("No,no")-to do what? to look afteryour interest? No; to go and do the humble dirty work of the Minister of the hour. (Loud cheers.) In fact, that you are going to constitute Lord Palmerston the despotic ruler of this country. ("No, no.") Well, butiif he is not checked by Parliament-if, the moment Parliament does check him, he dissolves Parliament, and, instead of sending up men who are independent enough to assert their and your rights, you send up mere creatures of his will
what is that but investing him with the powers of a despot? Ay, and let me tell you that it is a despotism of the clumaiest, most expensive kind, and at the same time the most irresponsible on the face of tho earth; because you surround the Minister with tho sham appearance of a representative form of government- you cannot get athim whilehe hasgot a Parliament beneath whose shield he can shelter himself; and if you don't do your duty in your elections in sending mnen up tothe House of Commons who will vigilantly watch the Minister of the day, then, I say, you are iLn a worse plight, because governed in. a more irresponsible way, than if under the King of Prussia or the Emperor of the French. (Loud cheers.) But who is Lord Palmerston, that we are to invest
him with this power? (Hear, hear.)' Who is he? ("A traitor."1) No, I will say nothing worse of him here than I have said to his face in Parliament (hear, hear) - but
when I want to know what a man is, I ask, "What has he done?" (Cheers.) There is no other test like that. That was Napoleon's question always if anybody talked to him about somebody being a great man-What has he done? Lord Palmerston has been 50 years in Parliament ("52")-52 years in Parliament. 'Well, he has belonged, I believe, to every Government, excepting one, during those 50 years. (Laughter.) I remember T nc 2Tm newspaper, which spent about 15 years in trying to blacken his reputation, and is now polishing him up every day (loud laugiter and cheers), when it had said everything else that was gross, vulgar, and vituperative about him, wound up by saying that he had been " boots" to every Administration for 30 years. (Renewed laughter.) Now, I beg you to understand that this is the language of The Times, and not mine. (Iaughter.) But, with what has his name been associated ?(I. Peterlco.") Yes, Peterloo I I am reminded that on thisvery spot of ground ("Yes, yes "'), when the peeple were cut down and trampled upon
ythe yeomanry cavaly, Lord Palmerston was one of the Government and voted in favour of that outrage. (Groans, anderiesof "Shame1") Well,butwhathashedone since? Because men may have been in the early part of their career, by circumstances like Sir Robert Peel, put into a certain groove, and hardly answerable for theecourse they were obliged to run. What has he done since he has been able to take his own choice ? What does he propose now to do? ("Ruin us P") He was a member of the Reform Ministry in 1831; he left his old party and Joined the Whigs as a Reformer. But was he one of those
vho put forward the cause of reform, or was he there as a draghain? I have seen to-daya speech which has been sent to me, delivered by Sir James Graham at Carlisle. He .ays-"I and Lord Joh,n_Ru ssell re the onlytwo Cabinet
Mimsters remaining alive who formed tbe Government which brought in the Reform Bill of 1831 -" and he say
" We had Lord Palmerston among us, but f very soon fonnd out that he was not very much disposed for the work that we were engaged upon." ("Hear," and cheers.) In December, 1853-little more three years ago-Lord Palmerston belonged to the Ministry of Lord Aberdeen. Now, Lor Aberdeen was not considered a ver
lberal man; we were all deluded with the idea that Lord Palnerston was the great champion of democracy, and that Lord Aberdeen was always the friend of despotism, I was not taken in by that, but a good many people were. (Cheers.) Well, but what did Lord Palme ston do in December, 1853, when Lord Aberdeen's Govern ment was preparing;a new Reform BSil, to be brought in in the session of 1854 ? Lord Palmerston left Lord Aberdeenr's Government because he objected to that modicum of reform that was then proposed (hear, hear); that bill, bearing on its back the names of Lord John Russell and Sir James Grabam,-certainly not two very rash or democratic Reformers (laughter)-which proposed to give a 101. franchise to the counties and a.modiflied franchise to the boroughs, so slghtly reduced that tome of my friends thought it would ratter operate as A restrictiorn in some boroughs than an extension ; that bill ~was too much for Lord PaimerSton to sWallow in 1853 and he left Lord Aberdeen's Cabinet avowedly because he objected to that bi1Ll (Bear, bear.) Well, what has he done since ? What has he done this very session? Why, he has orposed everything that bore the mere semblance of reform; he voted against Locke King's motion for a 101. county franchise which formed part of the biU of 1854; he has oppo'sed even the 40s. freehold franchise for Scotland, if you may believe the Lord-Advocate of Scotland, who is in the Ministry, for
he has gone down there and announced that the Government are opposed to It. Now,will youtellmeon what ground I am lbe called ulpon to surrender my independence And freedom of thought and action to the will of a ~j~~iatgr t~gb #. 1 is? t Wby,e It U plorm to Set
by such a policy ? It appears to mae it- u aboui the most E andacious attempt npon your credulity thit-c et wd practised in this coTmtry, to think of raising the-cry at an election in favour of one man-for there is no other cry
attempted on the hutisngs-and for that man to o the I eater of the Liberal prty without having one liberal tenet in his profesdon of faith. (Cheers.) Why, *hen I read of men that I have hitherto considered to be earnest Reformers-when I read their speeches. and addresses, in which they have said, " I am for the
ballot, the extension of the suffrage, shortening Parlia- I ments, against church-rates, and will give ray heariy 'support to Lerd Palmerston's Governnent,"-my natural question is, "Are these mren idiots?-('Yes')-or are they dishonest ? ('Dishonest!')" If you attempt to carry on a business in private life, uou don't go to a nan that yon know iadirectlyopposed In is viewasto whatyotLwishto accomplish, and put yourself under his guiiance. Lord Palmerston is not content -with a mere passive resstance to what you desire as Reformers. Ho lends an active oppos ton; he votes and speaks against every measure of reform that is brought into the House of Commons. (Cheers.) But we are told that Lord Palmerston' is a great friend of freedom abroad. (Laughter.) Well, noGw, go and ask those men in this oountry wliorepresent freedom abroad; ask Kossuth. (Loud cheers.) I will tell lounwhat hap. pened within my knowledge; it is no breach of confidence to say it. When that illustrious Hungarian was expected iEngland, after his impriaonment inTurkey, mv lamented friend Lord Dudley Stuart-whose devotion to the cause of these foreign refugees was as unbounded as it was sincerewent down to Southampton to meet Eossuth and receive him on the arrival of the steamer. Having to wait a day or two there, and being in the neighbourhood of Broadlands. where LordPalmerston lives, he went there and sai the noble lord, and received from hia a request to bring Eosauth over to Broadlands to see him. I remember receiving a letter from Lord Dudley Stuart, announcing to me this piece of inteligence with the greatest glee. He was delighted at theopportunity of taking Kossuth over to see LordPalmerston; and as soon as he arrived he announced to him the pleasing information. To his astonish. ment, he found Kossuth would not accept it; he woould not go near Lord Palmerston (cheers); and I have got a letter from Lord Dudley Stuart, asking me to use al my influence with Kossuth to induce him to go and call upon Lord Palmerston. He would not do it; and. my answer to Lord Dudley Stuart was this .--" You may depend upon it, Kossuth knows a great deal more about Lord Palmerston than you do." (Laughter.) Why, I could-not go into the particulars now, but they are all familiarto me. Every transaction of Lord Palmerston's foreign policy is known to me; I defy any human being to show an instance where anybody on the face of the earth has been happier or freer in consequence of Lord Palmerston's foreign polic
Cheers. He endorsed the invasion of Rome by teFrench. (Hear.) we have it inthe blue-books. He was the first in red othaste to congratulate the present Emperor of the French after his usurpation, when the blood was stil flowing in the streetsof Paris. Herefusedto seean envoysentfromtheHnugarians because he said he could treat with nobody but the Austrian Government. He treated the Italians in the same way. Are these facts or not? (" Yes, yes.") Nobody denies them. Do you think, then, it is consistent with common sense that the man who has no love for liberty or progress at home should have any love of that kind to ex. ort toforeign countries ? (Cheers.) Don't you think that
sm like liberality, and rogress like chatity, should begin at home? Well, what other title does he present to our confidence that the people of this country should be called upon by the impudence of three or four metropolitan journals, which, for reasons best known to themselves (hear), which I hope will be exposed some day, are calling upon the English people to lie down upon their belies in the dust before this man? What has he done? We are told he carried the Russian war to a triumphant conclusion. Now, I will tell you what he did in that war. Lord Palmerston was a memberof the Government which declared the war. (Hear.) If he be the man ef talent, with the powers of administration which we are told he has-if ho be A man of this towering genius, that we are all suddenly called upon to discover at the age of 73 (laughter), was he not likely, at least, three or four years ago, to have had a share of that energy, go that he might have imprted a portion of his policy spon the Government during bthe time he was one of them? He was respnsible for every blunder, just as much as any member of the Government. And what is the Cabinet now? 'Why, the majority of the Cabinet now was the majority of the Cabinet then. Lord Palmerston was not called upon to make a new Cabinet In order to carry on the war; certain members of the Cabinet-a nminority-seceded from it, and left the majority, of 'whoma Lord Palmerston was at the head. That maority is quite as responsible for everything that occurred during the early progress of the war (loud cheers) as they can claim to be entitled to any merit for any improvement in the conduct of the war after that minority seceded. But did Lord Palmerston ever himself lend his word to this imposture that is practised in his name? No; to do him justice, his toadies practise the imposture, but he has toldusmanfullyand inastraightforward way that he did not share in the delusion himself. (Laughter.) When Lord Aberdeen seceded from the Government, Lord Palmerston told Sir James Graham and the rest of the friends of Lord Aberdeen who remained in the Gorernment that he would carry on the government and the war upon greisey te smeprinciples that thueT, had been carried onL Dy Lord Aberdeen; that there sho d be no change in his foreign polc; and that he would only ask the some terms Of Peace as Lord Aberdeen would have been content, with. (Cheers.) That was not only mentioned privaLtely in the course of their discussions ameng, themselves, hut it came out in the House of Commons. Did Lord Palmerston himself ever come before us to complain of anything that had been done in the eArly conduct of the war while he was a member of the Cabinet? ; onthecontrary he defended everything. When Mr. Roebuck brought forward bis' motion (loud cheers) for inquiry into the toenes going on before Sebastopol, to try and hunt out, if he could, the cause of the ruin and disaster that had befallen our army did Lord Palmerston get up in his place in She House and say, "Here are admitted evils; I grant to the hon. and learned gentleman that this is a fair subject for inquiry ? No; he stood by things as they were, defended everything and resisted an inquiry by the committee. But what is moe
after the committee was appointed, and had sat nd inquired into the proceedings atS.bastopol, when Mr.Roebuckbrought forward a motion in the House of Commons consequent on the inquiry, did Lord Palmerston assist him' No; he voted against him again. What has he done besides? After sending out a couple of men--able and competent men (cheers), Sir John M'Neill and Colonel TLuloch (renewed cheering}-and after they had brought home a report certanly as able and, I believe, as conscientious as was ever made by public men-what did Lord Palmerston do ? Did he back up his own commissioners ? No. He would have done if it had been Smith, Jones, or Robinson that had been ooncerned (hear) ; but they were lords and earls who were in question-and what did he do? He appointeacom-
missioners. ("Shame!") And,then, whenpubHlcopinionrises to demand some improvement upon this state of things, what does hedo? Heinsultsthese distinguished men b.sending them a present each of l,000., which they sent back again (hootings and groans); lust the amount that was paid some
ime ago to apoliceman forhavingcaptured acelebrated political criminaL (Laughter.) Now, this isthesort of man that we are called upon all at once to fall down and worship ! Why, I say the brazen image shall have no worship from me. (Loud cheers and laughter.) But I want to ask these people that are here in anehester-I will first take Mr. Aspinall Turner. (Groans.) No, no, no; we will deal with them with reason, and not with clamour. (Hear, hear.) I want to put solmething before you that yenl May probably have the opportunity of asking them. The great complaint against ua, on the part of these gentlemen, is, that we are too indepeRdent of the Midnister. Now, ask them this qestion:-What would they have had us do in the case of that vote the other night that was threatened, to do justico to Colonel Tulloch and Sir John M'geill? I was in the Hounse of Commons waiting for the division, and certainly should have voted egainst the Government.. But Lord Pal. merston, seeing which way the wind blew, after havine spoken against the motion, got up and said " I won't divide the House upon it." Now, I want to know how Mr. Asnall Turner would have voted on that occasion. Would he have considered it very factious if he had joined the member for Devonshir4who sits on the otherside of the House,on this question ? Why, I see this gentleman's (Mr. Turner's) name as President of theCommercial Association,signedto a memo. rial, in which he states the whole of the facts I am stating, and says Lord Palmerston has not only failed to dojustice to these eminent officers who went out to make the inquiry, but has also given encouragement and promotion to the very men proved to have been culpable and neglectful. (Laughter.) r{ow, I must say I tbink Mr. AspinallTumrer islooking very much likes " 1conspirator" in this maatter ; he is guilty of a "coalition" with somebody to turn out a Minister. (Lsughter.) Well, what are we to do under these circumstances? Are we to follow this Minister, or to fellow the dictates of our own judgments and conscences? Now, I hear it said that we have been a thorn in the side of three Governmaents. We are told that three or four of us have been a thorn in the side of Lord Aberdeen, Lord John Russel, and now of Lord Palmerston. I can only say this,-if lfanchester should send up the two gentlemen that are nowcaudidates in opposition to my bon. friends, they wonltb be thorns in the oide of anybod. (Lod lugher. Wel, ut hatdo ouwant done in Parliament? Do you send up men to Parliament just to be told off into one lobby or the other according as the whipperin of the Treasury decides ? I suppose you want year members to do something better than follow the bidding of thc Treasury whip. Do you think there is much dangeer
now or your catching members of Parliament like]y to he too independent? I can assue you you Will find it just the contrary. And if the threats now held out should be carried into effect-if you should, unhappily for yourselves, lose those two members you have got (" Never !")-I will venture to say it will be a lOng timne before you will get two others of whom you will have to complain that they will be too independent when they get to London. (Hear, hear.) Why, now, it is the very thing of all others most difficult to find in London, is independence. Only cast your memories back. How few men bave we ever got permanently to join us in our attempt ever to thwart a Government? Four, or five, or six, or eight, or ten,-I could count them all on my ten fingers who remained resolute and determined to maintain an independent course. And why? Because the temptations, blandishments, and seductions practised on members of Parliament are very well known to those engaged in that avocation. Do you think I was not tempted like everybody else ? I have had my cards -my dinner cards, as large as that (exhibiting a h sheet of paper), and from Lord Palmerston too. (Loud cheers an laughter.) When I went up to Parliament in 1841 it would have been much easier, more tranquil, and to man
minds a much more agreeable life, if I had A once fallen into the track, and, instead of setting up an independent resistance to Government when I chose, I had -oined the governing class and becorne -no of their humbQe servants. But the very first day I went into Parliament, in 1841, when the lines of party were etill visible, when there ras a great gulf between the two vroat parties on the two sides of the House; when Sir Robert Peel had his 390 or 400 men, and Lord John Rusmell his 270 or 280 men, the very first time Igotnp and spoke asthememberfor Stockport, deearedl came to do somehing, sand that was toe eal the corn-lass, and I would know neither Whil

Lord Derby, Mr. Gladstone, and ir. Disreli have use&almoit the identical language-which I used on thlis spot seven or eight years ago. Here is my programme, "Non-intervention; diminished expenditure in your arsnmuentg, and diminished taxation if ton f6llowthat policvy. But am I when I see this policy, which seems to be advocated and very rapidly adopted by the whole Conservative party in the Hiouse of. Commons, immediately to turn from the course I took seven years ago ndsay, If you offer to reduce the establishments two millions a-year, you (Mr. Gladstone or Mr. Disraeli) only want to make a factious opposition to the Government, and therefore I will oppose you ? I want such factious oppostion. (Loud cheers.) I want you to bear in mind, though you have got free-trade, you are interested in gettln something else, and you will want something elsw,
3pea to yung men in shops and warehouses, foremen in jlaces of busin es who want some day to have the chance of
eing masters. ZLoud cheers.) I want the opentive who is educating himself to be a foreman, and who hopes some day to be a capitalist, to have the chance that he ma carry out his views and see a career before him. This mas the feting I had 17 or 1S years ago when we launched our assault upon the protective system. But there is a great deal more to do if you will make this country a place to live in, and for your children to thrive in, and sive a chance to every man, as I should like to see, oF rising in the -world, of becomingthe head of a family, and finding employment for his labour, and give him all the advantages of capital if he sets up to be a master. How is this to be done but by widening the circle of basiness operations, and by diminishing the pressure of your taxatiou? Now, what do we see In London? 20,000 or 30,000 unemplo ed workmen. Why are they unemployed? You don't nni that the newspapers connect cause and effect. They are unemployed because capital is scarce - because money is worth 6 or 7 per cent. at the banks. Who will lay out his money in building houses, to pay him at the rate of 6 or 8 per cent., if he can get that percentage for the money he
puts into the banks? Consequently thereis no money being 2nvested in buildings. And why is there such a high rate of interest? Because the floating capital of this country has, during the last two or three years, been wasted in sudden and extraordinary expenses. (Loud cheers.) But you don't see your newspapers that were bawling for the war, honestly tell the people in London that thereason they are p,ffering want of employment is that that floating capital, wbich is always a limited quantity in the countrythe floating capital which sets all your fixed capitl in motion-has been exhausted, wasted, by the course that has been pursued. It may have been necessar or not, I am not now going into that question; but I say let cause and effect be connected, don't let the people be deluded. They tell these poor people in London they may emigrate; but I say it is downnght quackery to talk of relieving the country of 20,000 or 30,000people by emigration. Moreover, if we remainat peae, nd keep our hinistryinordierduringthenext wo or three years, why, there will not be enough builders and joiners for the work that will have to be done. It is downright quackery and insulting childishness to say you must make people em3grate as a means of relieviog you of such a large surplus population. It is all moonshine. (Cheersand laughter.) Now I say if you are to have a progressive deveopement of your trade, you must pursue a polcyfavourable to it. Yoa must enable your Government to reduce taxation, and especially that taxation which presses on the labouring and on the miadle classes,-I mean the taxtion that is laid in an indirect form upon your articles of consuniption. (Applause.) The more you rewove these axes, the more your trade will epand, the more your population may increase and flourish, and the happier bw the oonditfon of the country. But you havecomenowtoadea.stnd still; andthisisone of my great complaints against this Government. It is the most incompetent Government in matters of finance we have had since that of Sir Robert PeeL Here you are laying on increased taxes on your tea and sugar- here you are, at this moment, to gratify the people wio have the votes and cried out against a 16d. income-tax, taking off 9d. from the tax. And it is perfectly certain (as Mr. Gladstone says) that the Government have not the means before them to do it honestly; and next year, unless you have a reduction of expenditure, there must be an increase of taxation. (Cheers.) I appeal to my right hon. friend here, wo has looked into the matter as weU as myself, whether it is not inevitable. And in two years from that time, if you do not reduce yoyr expenditure, you wl ave a deficit of something like 10,000,0001 to make up. Your present Prime Minister, who lives from hand to mouth in his poltical career-who has never cared for the morrow so that he can keep the cry of to-ay-is parsuing a most reckless course of finance - and if you had called out for the whole 16d. being tai;en off, instead of the Pd., he woould stil have let it go, and left it to somebody else tv find out how to make up the deficiency next year. t(Hear, hear," and laughter.) And not only that ut loo at your Indian finances-nobody looks at them; you have put a screen before your faces, so that yon are hidden from India, and India is hidden from you. (Cheers.) And so your Government sits down in London, and writes out to that country an order to send n army to the Persian Gulf, and another to Hongkong; and that the Indian treasury must pay for it, or the half of it. They have no voice inthematter out there. And how standyour Indian finances? Deficiton defirit every year-deficit lxst year andathe year before that-a constantly accumulating deftcit. And what has been done to meet it ? Why, they tried for a loan some time ago, at 43 per cent., but could not get the money. Then they have tried to realize it in India, at 5 per cent,, but could not get the money. And the last advices are that you cannot get the money. (Rear, hear.) But, as Sir Robert Peel told us in tho House of Commons on some occasion, you are as much responsible for the finanoes of India as you are for the finances in Downing-street; and if a Uow things to { on in this reckless way, by which you become emratZassed at home and embarrassed abroad, the time of reckoning wiU overtake you, as it does overtake all sendthrifs, and there will be au evil day for you and your children sooner or later. (Hear, hear.) Now, is it to be considered unreasonable that we have joined Mr. Gladstone in his motions ? I voted for his motion that there should boa reduction of the expenditure, and Mr. Disraeli also voted With him. Were we, then, to go into tho other lobby because we found MIr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraelivoting ,with us on that occasion ? I believe they were right,-l belive that they both took a most philosophical and able view of our finances; and what I want you to consider is whetheryou think the men who take theindependentcourse which I have suggested. whether you think they are men who ought to be denounced here by interested and jealous individuals, because they have had the manlinees to do their duty. (Cheers.) I come now fora moment to the conduct of my right hon. friend here and of my bon. friend whom I repre. sent here on this occasion. (Great cheering, followed by
Three cheers for Bright," and ' one cheer more.") I have lived with MLr. Bright in the most transparent intimacy of mind that two human beings ever enjoyed together. I don't believe there is a view, I don't believe there is a thought, I don't believe there is one aspiration inthe minds Of either of us that the other is not acquainted with. I don't know tha heei anything that I have soiught to do

CH o,as to my friendhbere io zits beside zoe (Mr. Gibson); he was not of mny selection; he was stelected in the palour of my late reverend friend 'Sir Thomas Potter (ap-
plause) and Iwas at the time mot averycnthusitic supprter. of the right hon. gentleman..Ho was broughthere, ansia,a
always went with those goodImen who at that time took the lead-Sir T. Potter, Mr. Kershaw, Mr. Callender, and others -I joined them, and fought the batle, and we won it for them. (Cheers) But this Iwi3llsay of him, that thoughbhe tometimes haa an arch look (great launghter in which Mr. Gibson joined), and sometimes seem as if lse were almost quizzing youx (renewed laughter), and you fancy that there is a little twist of sarcasm about him in all he says and.a he looks, yet this I will say of him, that there is an earnest. mess in his character which I every day more and more appreciate, and which I did not when I first saw him-as man7 others may not when they first se him-give him credit for. (Lond plaudits.) Well, naow, how has my right hob., frienid employed himself ?(Hear, hear.) He iniightbave g,onie into office, and was in c0lce. He is a man bred in fashionable lie-he has not the same excuse tbat I have for keeplny, out of that sort of company. (Great laughter.) Now, if he had allowed himself to beLbsorbed in, the aristocratic circles of London-noboby can doubt who sees hiim that he would, have been an ormament to those circles. (Cheers ian laughter.) He might have led a very happ
life thpreL; and, hetissgmemnber for Manchester, t'hey would hive~ been, I dare say, very -proud of him. And then thero would-have been none oftbis olpposition now set up &amaint himn. But he has taken an smdepeisdent bourse. Hre has worked in favour of great questions affecting the interests of
th.Poole. Now, there is one- question which he carried -1'not give himecredit for carrying it singlehanded, and that is; the question of the newspaper stamp. (Lound cheers.) He, carried that and the repeal of the advertisemenit duty by his dexterity and ability in debate, his exquisite tactics, his knowledge of the formas of the House, and by accepting the assistance of hon. gentlemen on the other aide of the Rouse. (laughter.) iremember the first time Ispoke in public after returning home from ab temporary absence on the continent, in 1847. It was at a. dinner party lin London, at which I took tho chair ; and I took the opportunity of launching this question of the press, and saymng that the newspaper press of England was not free, and that this was a thing w hich the Rerormers of the country ought to set aboutt-to emancipate it. Well, I got a most vicious article next day from The Times newspaper for that, iand 27wc Times has followed us both with avery ample store of venom ever since. ("1 Hear,)) and laughter.) But now thes are the very men, men like my right hon: friend who undertook these great questions, ind braved the hostiity of interested parties, that the rank and file of their constituents ought to support and protect fromr the Tengeance threatened against them. (Hear, hear.) Well, I am told there is a complaint rmade of these gentlemen bymy friend Mr. Alderman Neild, of whomi I always wislh to spea with respect, as an old friend of mine, and wh ihik te don' t pay sufficient attention to private Bills inLodn Well, now, may opinion is that theei a. good deal too much made of that. The fact is, the les
you have to go to Lo6ndon for private Bills the better. If you want a Bill carried in Parliament, the thing is done by the House of Comamons ; and let me tell you, when you want a man -who has influence in that House, to assist yoiu in obtaining a Bill, you mns t go to just such a man as my right hon. frienLd or Mr. Bright-men who have force in the House ; who have the ability to make themselves felt when they speak in that Hlouse.- (Cheers.) I tell you that those men who are independent in that House, who have the power of speak-ing so asto commaind the attention of the House, will do more for you by what they say in half-a-dozen words than an hour's talk will do for youx from one of those toadies who are always known to be at the beck anid call of the Government. (Cheers.) But I am told that this Manchel;ter School, as it is called, do not pay Tuffll cdent attention to the interests of M1anchester.N ow, I think we. have done as much for Manchester as anybody. Have oDunot got your daily newspapers now? Bet for my right hon. fri end you igt hav hd to be content with news three days olud. (Cheers.)nWho was it that got t'hose 4,000 names added to your register by having the clause inserted in faLvour of the compound householders ? It was Mr. Bright. Nlo man of less energy or influence than he could have done it, because it was a thing repugnant to the governing class in the House of Commons to have any addition to the register at all. (Hear, heaLr.) I ask thoes
4,000 men how they are going to vote ? (Cheers) I donet say to those men " You are not to exercise your vote, or your power, independent of Mr. Bright or anybody else ;
but thIssay, " Shame upon you if, having got the frAnchise for yourselves by a man who advocates the extensloud o the franchise to others, you iv the power vested in you to the hands of somebodyel, who will refuse the franchise to those who have not got it!I" (Loud applause.)Well, hut now, this Manchester school, and thecir etu the corn laws re~iealed and free trade esta-
blse,by which thetrado of this country has pretty neaLrly doubled during the last 12 years,-I sa, who has benefie
so much as Manchester by that? ( bar ear.) Bat, if you come to your own local affairs,imitellthese gentlemen who ae seting temseles upan swelling abolut as aldermnen, and sa we are pcoplIe who have not attended to the intret of .!ancesier,-1 tell them they owe everything to us-even their dignity. (Hear, hear.) If I were to take the watch out of thoyeocketof my friend in the chair there, and read the inscription upon it, why it would show that it was given to him by a number of us who associated together to getacharterof incorporationforManchester.(Greatcheerixng.)
am - dg to my friend Mir. AldermaLn Neild-I do not speak it in any spirit of egotisma now, because I may without vanity say that it does not at all add to my famne, but I would remind him that on one unlucky day for the lord of the minor of this place his steward summnoned me, along with 10 or 12 other gentlemen, to elect a. boroughreeve and constables for Mancelseter. I was taken into some d__~ cobwebbed, murky hole, and *%t down witha those ientle' men to elect a beroughreere and constables for Mancliester. After we had finiahied our business we were entitled, I think, to a leaden ticket-for some soup or a dinner. (laughter.) I saidl immediately,"el wha i
thbe world does all this mean?" Canit betthiat' UMnchester-for I was not an old Inhabitant of the town,-iA It that in this great town of Mtanchester we are stil living.under the feudal system? Doess Sir Oswaldl Moselcey.jliving up 2n Derbyshire send his mandate down here for us to come into this dingy hole to elect a government for Manchester, and then go and get a ticket oIr su at his ex In? (Getcering and laughter.)Why, now,I said, Iwl put an end to this thinig. (Cheers) And it so happened that just at that mnoment my friend, 3Mr. 'Nelld, was trying to gt sm amendment to the Act of Parliamnent by which theaffair-s of the plioe were carried en in this borough. Bet my friend Mr -e lwent to work- in that. as- he-went to work in everything-it was by a little bit of comapromise and concession. (Hear.) He went to the party whio were already in possession of the power of the towrn, and asked them to co-operate (hear) ; and they get some unworthy people to come to their meeting and upset the benches, Lnd make a great confusion, and the whole meeting wasdestryed - and in fact Mr. NTeid was very much diseomfited. Well, i wrote to M[r. Neild, and if he does me the honour to preLserro anything that I w-rite to him he has the note now. (IRear, hear.) I said,
11If you will do thin thing in the way that I intend to do it, and you will join wthme, I wfll undertake to say that we wil get a charter of incorporation for MAnchester." (Rear.) Mr. Neild, who had tried what is a commnon thing writh these gentlemen-somrething thst will please everyoy, butt failSto please_aubody-camseto me like aLn honest, excellent, trae7hr;2 man as he is and he said, "1I have triedi
myway, and it doss not answer, I will go with youx; alI stipulate is that you wfi not take any course hut what is consistent with morality and honou~r, and I will joiu you in anuy way youa choose, in order to put an end to this state of thines." (ReaLr, bear.) We were three years at that workc, anal at one time be was 1.2001 out of pocket, and I was between 7001. and 8007. deficient, huit we got the charter. (Cheem)rs. ask these new fledged aldermen who are running about and saying, "1We wfil attend to nothing but the great national questions," are there in Manchester any men who have left their impress upon the town of Manchester more thin the four men who are stigmatized by these people as never paying any attention to local matters? (Cheers.) I aLm going to Huddersifeid to-morrow. (Cheers.) If my voice does not fail mae, I should likce to come hack and have one more grvat meeting in this hall (loud c'heers), but it moust be on onec condition, andI that is, that
sme genriemun here set to work. (Hear.) IteU youhere isa combination,-I.1caltafOulconsPiracy (cheers) -toupsettwo of the ablest men in the House of Commons-one of them is absent and, therefore, it is no flattery to say that if the House of Commons had the power of returning three men to be members of their body I have not the least hesitation in saying that one of theseo men, if he was not in Parliamen5 would be John Bright. (" Hear," and loud cheers.) I tell you that it is you, and not they, who are upon your trials. You may dismiss them, but if you do you Wil never have them back agin for they will not be out of Parliament amonath. "Hear,hbear," and loud ap£lane.) And what will you have in the place of them ?
dpersonalities. I have only dealt with Lord Palmerston as a person because he has been but forward as a Policy. (" Hear," *nd cheers ) He is the only policy put forward on which the elections *re to turn. (Hear.) Bet now as toyournewcandidates There is Mr.Lowe. Seehim and hear him before you choose him. (Hear.) You have had one specimen of Ministerial oratory on this platform (laughter), and I want you to hear more of these " right honourable' and " hononrable" members of the aristocracy. Let them come and talk to you, and you will then know better howtoappreciatethemenyouhavegot. (Loud cheers.) Hear Mr. Lowe. I have heard kim, and I will say this, and in saying it I sbal be borne out by any impartial man in the Rouse of Commons, tbat, considering that he had somo reputation for ability when ho was at Oxford, and as a writer in The 2imes ("hear, hear," and laughter)
he has been the rnost consplcuous failure in the House of Commons that I have seen. (Cheers and latoter.) Then there Is my friend Sir John Potter. I willsy nothing upon this subject (a laugh), except this,-l am sorry to see him in opposition to his old friends.

PARLMIA1ENTARY INTELLIGENCE.
HOUSE OF LORDS, TuuBsDAY, ;MAxo 19.
Tho House met at 6 o'cTock.
The Earl of DONOUGHMORE presented several peti. tions from places in Ireland for the repeal of the Income. tax, and against the removal of paupers from England to Ireland.
Lord SH ATESBtRY presented petitions against traffic in opium from Leicester, Great WArley, Protestant Dissenters at O&lton, Hadlow, Slough, Beckenham, and Bishop Middleham.
T'o LORD CHANCELLOR presented a petitiorn from the Liverpool Guardian Society for the Protection of Trade, which stated that the business of the Liverpool County Court was most satisfactorily administered by Mr. Joseph Pollock, the judge of that court; but, inasmuch as the important mercantile pursuits of the community of Liverpool gave rise to very difficult questions as to the customs of trade, and other points which required very great attention on the part of that judge, the business of the court was often greatly in arrear. T hey therefore prayed that the grievance might be remedied by the passing of a BiU for the appointment of an additional judge. The noble and learned lord bore testimony to the zeal with which Mr. Pollock discharges his duties, even to the injury of his health, and said that the question of appointinig an additional judge was at present under the consideration of the Government, but it was a very difficult thingto interpose in tho case of Liverpool in consequence of the pressure of business, as other places similarly circunatanced might also ask for the a.ppointment of additional judges. It would, how ever, remain writh the Legislature to determine wvhether an ndditiona judge should. be appointed in Liverpoo],
THE PERSIAN TREATY.
JAPAN.
The Earl of EGLINTON, referring to the statement made the other night by the noble earl the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with regard to the various clauses in the treaty with Persia, said he understood that we were about to give up by that treaty the right of protecting Persian subjects, except those employed on our mission, provided other nations agreed to adopt a similar course; but the noble earl did not inform their lordships whether that right of protection would be extended to the wives and families of those emsployis. Now, as the immediate cause of the late warwith Persia was the Incarceration of the wife of one of those eniployes, it seemed to be very necessary that their lordships should know whether the proteotion was to extend to the wives and families of our emplicys as well as to those cmployds themselves. While he was on his legs he would take the opportunity of calling the noble earl's attention to the fact that we appeared now to have fallen into difficulties with Japan, for he had secen in one of the evening papers of yesterday a statement, copied from one of the Dutch journals, to the effect that there had been a conflict between two British ships and the Japanese. We had lately been trying our hands with all the weak States of the world-with Naples, China, and Persia, and he should not be at all surprised to hear that we were going to try our hands with Japan. If so, he begged to suggest that we should try to pick a quarrel with Timbuctoo.
The Earl of CLARENDON, in answer to the question of the noble earl, said, I have to state that it is true that we have offered to renounce the right of protecting the subjects of Persia, except those employed on the mission, provided other Governments will do the same. There has been no special provision made with respect to the wives and families of such cmploypds. It is, however, understood that they will be placed exactly on the same footing as they have always been, and therefore I believe that protertion will be extended to their wives and fanilies. The cause of that which the noble.earl has called the war with Persia was not the incarceration of a wife of one of the cnploy6s on the British mission; and I think that the noble earl must be Aware that, in truth, that was not the cause of the war. With respect to the paragraph which the noble earl has read in one of the newspapers, as to a conflict between some British ships and the Japanese, accompanied by a humorous invitation to a war with Timbuctoo, I can only say that Her Majesty's Government have not received any information with regard to it.
NAPLES.
The Earl of HARDWICKE said it would be in the recollection of everyone that after tho contest with Russia the plenipotentiaries of England, France, Austria, Prussia, Turkey, Sardinia, and Russia met in congress, and that after that congress had settled, or very nearly settled, the affairs ef Europe with reference to the Russian war, they thought 3ttheir duty to take into consideration other subjects with reference to the affairs of Europe; and it was resolved that the French and English nations combined should make a serious interference in the kingdom of the Tvvo Sicilies with reference to its internal govern. ment. That a serious step was contemplated there could be no doubt; for we knew this important fact, that it was resolved that the Emperor of the French and the Queen of England should send a combined force into the Bay of Naples for purposes which, in my opinion, are not at aU disclosed in the papers that have been laid before the House. It waa stated in those papers that that force was sent for the purpose of protecting British property within the territory of the King of Naples. That the matter was of serious importance as far as England was concerned there could be no doubt, for after having determined on this point the Government directed a very importantandgallantofficer-nolessapersonthan SirR. S. Dundns-to boist his flag on board no less a ship than the Dlke of Wellington, to take three or four line-of-battle ships, and to proceed to the Bay of :Naples; while the Emperor of the French collected a force of something like the same magnitude at the port of Toulon. Now, it was statedin the papers laid before Parliament that the object of the British force was the defence of British property in the event of an insurrection in Naples, and it was stated in a letter, dated the 23d of October, from Mr. Petre:-
"M. Carafa requested us to assure our respective Governments that British and French subjects would continue to receive at the hands of the Neapolitan Government that unfailing protection and enjoy that security to which their unblemisbed conduct and respect for the laws had always entitled them."
Thatwas the only insight afforded of the reason for the with. drawal of forces of such magnitude. Now, he recollected that in 1849, when the present First Minister was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and -when there were very serious troubles in that part of Italy, a single lineof-battle ship in the port of Naples and another at Genoa were sufficient for the protection of British subjects, and at Genoa a line-of-battle ship was able to give every necessary assistance and support to Her Majesty's subjects. Therefore it was utterly absurd to put forth that a fleet of the magnitude he had alluded to was intended for the purpose of protecting British subjects in case of insurrection. Then what was the purpose of the British Government and of the Emperor of the French -with respect to an armament of that description? He thought it not at aU improper that he should ask that question of the Government. It appeared very natural to suppose that this mystery and vacillation in the policy of this country, evinced in sending out a squadron and then suddenly recaUing it without any circumstance being explained to warrant such a course, must, on the mind of such a sensitive people as the Italians, leave impressions unfavourable to the constancy, decision, and promptitude, and general tone of policy of this country, and it was lamentable to think that this -was the second time within the course of a few years that such a course of policy had been exhibited to the Italians. Having said thus much, he found himselt stopped for want of information, and he would therefore now ask what was the cause of the sudden change of policy which led to the withdrawal of the squadron sent to the Bay of Naples.
The Earl of CLARENDON said he should confine himself to simply answering the question put to him. When it was determined by the Governments of France and England, for reasons of which their lordships were aware, that some force should be sent to Naples, it was thought best that each Government should send two or three vessels, that being the number which, by permission of the Govern. ment of Naples, they might send. When this intention was known, the English and French Governments received
mnformaton which led them to apprehend that the appearnee of the force off Naples might lead to an insurrection, and it certainly was not in the least the intention of the Frenh
or English Government to produce that effet. All that they desired and aimed at was a change of the system
there; bub it certainly was not their desire to increase the discontent, to produce insurrection, or effect a change of Ministry; and though theymight have subjected themselves to the imputation of vaciation in their policytheythought it better to run that risk, and the two Governments withdrew their fleets.
Earl GREY said it was obvious that this subject could not be discussed at the present moment. The attention of Parliament had been occupied with the still more pressing question of the Chinese war, and that circumstance had prevented the subject of the present conversation attracting the consideration of their lordships; but he hoped that at the opening of the next Parliament the subject would not be overlooked. The papers laid on the table deserved the most serious attention of their lordships and a fuU discussion. (Hear, hear.)
The Earl of HARDWICKE said he had received an nsawer very much of the sort he expected, and it was perfectly clear from it that there had been grave intentions of a serious description with respect to the Idngdom of Naples
that these intentions wero frustrated by some circumstances which their lordships were not permitted to under-
stand, and the frustration led to tho withdrawal of the force sent out to Naples. The two GOvernments of France and England must have been strre, when they resolved to send a force to the Bay of Naples, that insurrection,
was as certain as when the same thing was done before. On a previous occasion- the same operation was performed, which he saw, and anything more lamentable than the policy of England in those waters could not be described. An insurrection took place, supported by the outward show of the tricolour flag flying at the masthead of the flagship, and the tricolour flag being displayel in the theatres of Palermo by officers of the fleet. That insurrection was put down by General Filangieri with torrents of blood. He would venture to say that had the British fleet now gone to the Bay of Naples the same result was certain to have occurred. This was known to the two Governments of England and France, and therefore they must have had designs of very great importance with respect to the kingdom of Naples, but they weremost fortunatelyand most proporly stopped by circumstances which their lordships were not permitted to understand.
Earl GRANVILLE said that the noble earl who spoke last but one pursued a course regular and in conformity witli the u sago of their lordships' House. That noble earl stated that, in his opinion, the subject was deserving of discussion, and trusted that it would undergo discussion at the next meeting of Parliament; but the noble earl who last spoke had certainly pursued a very irregular course, and had stated what were the past intentions of the Government in a manner not founded in fact. The subject certainly had better not be discussed until it was brought more regularly before th'c House.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH would not go into the question at the present time, but he reeollected that this country had at a past period Incurred obligations to the people of Sicily which had never been fulfilled, and which should never be forgotten.
The following Bills were severally read a third time and prssed:-Customs DutiesBil, Race-horse DutyAct Amendment Bil, Paupaer aintenance Bill, Cinque Ports Act Amendment Bill.
The foUowinig BiUs were each read a secondtime:-Mutiny Bill, Marine Mutiny Bill, Mr. Speaker's Retirement Bill, Exchequer-bil's (21,049,700.) Bil.
CONSOLIaDATED FUND (APROPRIIATION) BILL.
On the motion that this BiU be read a second time,
Lord MONTEAGLE complained that the Bill had not been printed with the rest of the BiUs that had come up from the House of Commons. It was quite true that by usage the whole power of originating money Bills rested with the House of Commons, but the knowledge of the taxation of the country and the application of the publio money were matters in which their lordships had an equal interest. Serious alterations had been made in the form of this Bil, in consequence of the change that had taken place in the army and Ordnance departments, and, although he did not intend to do more at present than to point out the alteration, he trusted that next session the subject would come under the consideration of their lordshsps.
Earl GRANVILLE said that the usual practice had been followed in not printing this Bill. He would explain to-morrow in committee the reasons which had led to the arrangement in the form of the votes to which his noble friend had drawn attention.
After a few words from Lord PAM3=E and Lord MO.vMGLE, the Bill was read a second time.
THE TURNER BEQ-UEST OF PICTURES.
Lord. ST. LEONARD'S rose to call the attention of the House to the bequest by the late 3Mr. Tarner of his pictures and drawings to the nation. Having seen, he said, some time ago in the papers of the day that bequest of pictures to the nation stated, and knowing its great value, he was at first apprehensive that the country might lose the pictures by some neglect to perform the conditions on which the gift was made. With the view of knowing exactly how the matter stood, he inquired in their lordships' House for papers, and when he obtained them, which he did not do until a con5iderable time had elapsed, he gave them a careful perusal, and found that the case asmed a very different aspect, and that the country was in no danger of losing the bequest. But stiU Mr. Turner's intentions vere in great danger of being altogether disregarded; and the nation, having taken advantage of the gift, ought to perform the conditions on which it was made. It was difficult to estimate the great value of that gift, but he (Lord St. Leonard's) apprehended he spoke in no exaggerated manner if at a moderate view he said it could not be less than l50,0001. If the pictures in question were now brought into the market, so highly were
they appreciated they would fetch enormous prices; and at I a well regulated sale he had no doubt they would bring in the aggregate the sum he had just mentioned. This was a donation to the public, and it included drawings which were above all price (hear, hear); for if England stood, as it confessedly did, at the head o adl nationsm reference to water. colour drawings, Turner himself as confessedly stood at the head of the water-colour drawers of every nation. There was a purity, abrilliancy, a softness, and a correctness of execution in his water-colour drawings which delighted every person who saw them. His sketches were most striking from their great power, and his finished drawings it was impossible to overestim te. But he did what it was extraordinary he should have done, considering he was a painter in oil and such a first-rate artist. He altogether abstained
frommixing anythingwith his water-colours, andwas, there- I fore, a pure artist in water-colours. He (Lord St. Leonard's) feared that if our water-colour artists continued to pursue a different course in the mixing of their colours we should have to deplore the result in the deterioration of the art. There was a power, a depth, and a breadth in pure watercolours which it wvas impossible to overestimate; and he knew nothing better calculated to prevent the contrary system being carried to a deplorable extent than a familiar acquaintance with the inimitable drawings of Mr. Turner. He (Lord St. Leonard's) did not pretend to be a connoiEseur of art, and he had no more knowledge of water-colour drawing than he had aequired from a genuine admiration of some of the best specimens of it; but it was impossible to overrate the position of Mr. Turner with regard to art in this country. If not the first, he certainly stood among the first of English painters and he had placedhis country at the head of all others in reference to drawing in water-colours. He (Lord St. Leonard's) must, however, say that his pictures, containing al his various styles, ought not to have been mixed together in the way they had been, and that a greater attempt ought to have been made to classify them. He believed that Turner's habit throughout his lifetime was this. With his great genius he had that which alone made genius valuable-un. tiring industry and a determination never to lose an opportunity of pursuingthe art to which he was wedded. When he painted a picture, if he did not sell it immediately, his love for it increased the longer he kept it, and that was the way in hich sO many of his pictures had been accumulated. In his lifetime he would paint a fewpictures on commission but he would not sell a picture to which he became attached, although he had began it in that way. The picture it the
1ational GalUery of "Dido building Carthage,'5 which hands down his name to posterity, was actually sold, but he bought it back himself at what was then a very large price. In order to draw their lordships' attention to the obligations the nation was under to Mr. Turner's memory, he would state shortly what Mr. Turner's testamentary dispositions were. He(LordSt. Leonard'slbelieved they had not beenunderstood He could not believe there was any intention to go in direct opposition to the wishes and injunctions expressed by the testator; but he believed there was a general notion thathis testamentary dispositions were altogether void and binding upon no one. When, however, he (Lord St. Leonard's) remembared who were the trustees of the National Gallery-
articulaxly when he saw the noble marquis ospoite (the arquis of Lansdowne), who was so wel ye in art and so great a patron of it-he had only to point out to the noble marquis and to their lordships what was right and fair in this matter to have it put on a footing consistently with the real intentions of the testator, supposing they thought his suggestions right and fair. Unfortunately, Mr. Turner had had advice and assistance in the preparation of his testamentary dispositions, and the consequence was that it was very difficult to discover what were his real intentions. But it was not impossible to do so; and he (Lord St. Leonard's) had no hesitation in Eaying that, by carefully comparing the language and phrases used by the testator at different part of his testamentary dispositions, he had quite made out every intention which he had entertained in makemg those dispositions. By his 'will he gave the two pictures of " Dido building Carthage' and " The Calm" to the nation, on condition that they should be placed in the National Gallery between two Claudes. He (Lord St. Leonard's) had no doubt the trustees of the National Gallery had sought to comply with Mr. Turner's condition in this resect as far as was in their power. What Mr. Turner appeared to have meant was, that the two pictures, the " Dido building Carthage' and
Queen of Sheba" and the 'Isaac and Rebecca." Having described the relative position of the pictures, which was not, he thought, in all points satisfactory, the noble and learned lord proceeded to say that he was not finding fault with the hanging, because he considered the trustees had done all they could in this res ect, and really mcant to do justice to both painters. Ha should now pro. ceed to state the nature of the gifts in Turner's complicated will and codicils, so as to enable the House to understand-
them without perplexing it with technicalities. The will was very simple. It gave the " Dido building Carthage" and the "D Tabley" picture to the National GaLery. ALl the rest of his estate, real and personal, was to be converted into money, and the produce was to be invested in Consols, whAch with his own Consols were to form one fund, out of which certain legacies and annuities were to be paid, and the residue was to form and support a charitable institution for poor and decayed male British artists. A suitable building was to be provided for that purpose. It was to be called " Turner's Gift." This will was dated in 1831, 20 years before his death. At that time he manifestly intended whatever pictures he then had, exce t the two given to the National GaLery, to be sold for the benefit of his institution, but he did-not make any mention of them. They might assume that this oreneral I ift was void under the Mortmain Act, is -it was necessary to buy land for the institution. In the next year, 1832, he made a codicil (which was not attested, but that wvas now immaterial), by which, referring to Turner's
,he directed a gallery to be built out of his Consols to
Moid his pictures, so as to keep and preserve them as a collection of his works to be viewed gratuitouely. His money
in the fands was to be for the endowment of this galler)y
and of the chtarity. Bat he appeared .to have intended th!s to operato only in CfaSQthere should not be any leg al objection to Turner's gif. -If Ewithin five years after- bis. death
at could not e carried into effect, then he revoked the gift ia bis wil, and the funds set apart for it were to form part of the residue of his estate. He then disposed of the
residue. Be first directed his executors to keep all his pictures in his Queen Anne-street house entire aud unsold, the whole to be supportedc by bis stock in the Bank, and to be held as "Turneres Gallery." Then, after giving certain life annuities, he left the residue of his property in the funds to the trustees of the Royal Academy, subject to their having on his birth-dav an nnual dinner, the cost of which was to be 50Z, and if the value of the retidue exceeded this amount the surplus was to go to a professor of landacape, or in providing a Turner's gold medal for the best landscape every two years. If the trustees did not accept of this offered residue, he gave it to one OF his legatees. It was manifest that he considered his residue at that time as of small amount. In 1846 he made a codicil
afterwards cancelled andin part illegible, which was only materialas itshowed cld lythattheRoyal Acadenywere not tobes his residuary legatees. In 1848, 17 years af ter the first codicil, after revoking several annuities audlegaciks, he gave hts finished pictures, except the tro mentioned in his will, to the trustees of the Niational Gallery, preeided that a room br rooms were added to the present National Galery, to be, when erected, called "Turner's Gallery," in which such pictures were to be constantly kept and preserred* and until such rooms should be erected tha pictures zere t
remain in the gaUery and house in Queen Anne-street, ad he made provision forthem accordingly. He 'thc erx.-. -y provided-their lordships would observe his anxiet. .-- thc pictures should not be removed from the hnasus
galleryunless and untiltheroomswereattachedto be X2er-
norshouldthetrusteesof theNationaiGallery .uve .nypowe. whatsoever over the pictures unless his wisL, - before declared, was fully oarned out by them. It wv ja wmil that either the pictures should remain, and be called "Tarner's Gallery," and be the property of the nation, or that they should remain entire at his houso ansl gallery during the lease. lie directed the leaseto be renewed, "to the intent that sucb pictures might always remain and be one ontire gaUezy," to be seen by the public gratuitously;
it in case the trustees should not be able to renew trne lease of his gallerythe pictures were to be sold. He added no further directions. By a codicil of the same date he fixed the period within which the trustees of the National Gallery were to comply with his wil or the bequest to them was to be void. By the last codicil, in 1849, he limited the time to 10 years after his death. If Turner's gaUery was not erected within that time the gift was to be void, and his pictures were to be exhibited by his trustees gratuitously during the lease of his house, except the last two years of that term, and then they were to sell the pictures. Out of the producehe gave, first, 1,OOOZ. to the pension fnd, of the Royal Academy, provided they gave a Tuner's medal forlandscape painting; secondly, legacies to several charitable institutions, "and the residue of the produce to fall into the residue of his estate for the benefit of the intended hospital in his will mentioned." When the persons interested got together the questiou arose what was to be done, and bills were filed in Chancery. The result of that proceeding was that all the persons concerned were represented, except, indeed, the memory of Mr. Turner, and an arrangement was come to which was confirmed by a decree of Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, than whom no more eminent or painstaking man sat upon the judicial bench. It was, howvever, to be remembered thatthe Court was in'the habit of abiding to a considerable extent by the opinion of counsel in cases where anarrangement was agreed to, and that, no doubt, w as the case ontihe occasion to which he had referred. By that decree-
"The Court having before it the heirs at law and next of kin, and the executors and the trustees of the Royal Academy, and the Attorney-General, declared by consent that aU the pictures, drawings, and sketchea, by Turner's hand 'werato be deemed as by will given forthe benefit of the public.' fAnd when selected in manner thereby directed, they were to be retained by the trustees for the time being of the National Gallery ; and, by like consent, the Court declared that the trustees of the Royal Academy were entitled to the sum of 20,0001, sterling, free from legacy duty. The heirs were to take the real estate, and the next of kin were declared entitled to tho leasehold house in Queen Anne-streets and the residue of the personal estate, of which 20,0001. 3 per cents, were to be transferred to them at once. The Academy trustees waived their claim to the legacy of 1,0(01. bequeathed to their pension fund, and all other benefits under the wi and codicil."
Now, in point of law, the Royal Academy was not entitled to one single shilling of the propertyof Mr. Tarner under any provision of his will, so that they had obtainedc 20,0001. to which they had no more right than he himself bad. Now for his part, he should have thought that the Royal Academy would have been wiling to lay out that sum of mon in a way to do honour to Turner's memory. Nothing would have been more easy than to apply that money to
ouna gallery whichwould contain the pictures bequeathed to be added to the National Gallery, or, at al events, how easy to apply some portion of it to increase the sum of l,wI.which was to be employed in the erection of a monument to Turner in the place where such a monument ought to be erected-St. Paul's Cathedral. There were also many other modes in which that money might have been applied to the perpetuation of Turner's memory. After he had made himsef master of the whole facts of the case, he had felt itto be his duty to writo a civil letter to Sir C. Eastlake, the President of the Royal Academy, telling him that he was about to bring the matter before their lordships' House, and asking him in the first place whether the Royal
Academy considered that they were entitled to 20,00= , free from all condition or liabiity; and, secondly, whether the trustees of the National GaUery considered that they held the pictures of the late Mr. Turner disoharged from aU the conditions imposed by the gift. In answer to that letter Sir C. Eastlake had informed him that the trustees of the National Gallery held the bequest of the late Mr. Turner under a decree of ViceChancellor Kindersley, to which decree he begged to refer him. Now, perhaps he understood the mzeaning of a decree of a Court or Chancery as well as Sir C. Eastlake, but what he had wished to elicit from that gentleman was whether the trustees of the National Gallery or the Royal Academy considered that they were discharged from all the obligations laid down in Mr. Turner's bequest? Sir Charlesa Eastlake added in his note that the Royal Academy, from a desiro to carry out the wishes of Tarser, had instituted a gold medal for landscape painting. to be called the" -Turaer Medal." It thus appeared that, having taken 20,0001. without being entitled to a single shilling, the Academy thought they would discharge their obligations by paying 20Z. for a gold medal once in two years. There could be no doubt from the tenour of hisnotethat the opinion of Sir Charles Eastlake was that the pictures were beod subjeot to no conditions. It was to be hoped, however, that the Royal Academy, as they desired to stand well with their fellowcountrymen, and to honour the memory of their late brother in art, would seriously consider how much of the 20,0001. they could properly spend in carrying out the wishes of Turner. Even supposing that the terms of the will were to some extent inoperative in law, he contended that the nation having got possession of the pictures was bound to comply with the conditions. But there was nothing in the decree of Vice-Chancellor Kindersley to favour the view which seemed to be taken by Sir Charles Eastlake. That decree was singularly worded; but, while it declared that the finished pictures were well given by Turner to the trustees of the National Gallery, it inplied that the nation could not hold them except by complying with the conditions. Turner was evidently afraid of trustmg too much to a public body, although that body represented the nation, and therefore provided that until the Tmurer Galery was erected the pictures should not be taken out of his house in Queen Alnne-street. He also provided that the trustees of t-he National Gallery should have no power over the pctures unless and until the Turner Gallery was built. The house in Queen Anne-street, by consent of all parties, had been handed over to the next of kin without any conditions as to the pictures remaining there, and the trustees of the National Gallery, as the Queen Annestreet-house was no longer available for the purpose, might stand excused for having taken possession of the pictures. Bnt what had been done? If ever an intention was clearly and strongly expressed by a testator, so as to render escape from its inmunctions imposible, it was the direction of Tmrner that the National Gallery trustees should not have posseson of his pictures unless and until they had built a gallery for their reception. No attempt had been made to build a gallery, and instead of keeping the plotures entire in one collection, according to the provision in the codicil of 1848, the trustees had put a certain number of them in what had been called the " dark holes" of Marlborough-house. Some of the finest were exhibited there to great disadvantage, and, as if to cast ridicule upon the memory of Turner, they were placed alongside a number of his later pictures, which, although remarkable for their reproduction of aerial effects and management of light, were not worthy of his undoubted genius. The first thing which the trustees of the National Gallery ought to do was to remove the pictures from Marlborough-house and keep them safely in custody until the whole could be shown in one gaUlery. He hoped, also, that when they were exhibited in one gallery they would not be mixed up together, or placed according to their age, but would be arranged according to their subjects. There were among the watercolour drawings a. great mnanyunin~ishd pileces which oug'ht certainly to be exhibited, as thiev would be of immense benefit to students. YVery few artLsts knew where to begin in copying one of Turner's pictures, but these unfinished sketehes would enable students to learn how Turner himself commenced his works. While he was on the subject of the National Gallery, he might say that, during a recent visit to that institution, he had been struck by observing the statue of Wilkie standing alone, the sole reresentati-ve of
aintesd t, while vry fael w paintings by British artist re-
mained in the Galery. Nearly all the pictures there were those of foreign mastels, and he was at a loss to understand why the statao of Wi le should be placed among a collection of foreign paintings. It was also somewhat singular that all Wilkie's pictures had been removed from the National Gallery to Marlborough-house. With regard to the glazring of some of the pictures in the Galery, he thought it might be very advisable in particular cases, but he considered that the painting of Bacchus a-d Ariadne
one of the finest in the whole collection, had been completely,
spoiled by having glass placed before it. He -would suggest that while no ue-peer or peasant-'was excluded from
the Gallery, means should be taken to prevent the over-
crowding of the rooms and the adnission of persons in wet clothing, These regulations, he believed, would tend to the preservation of the paintiDgs.
The Marquis of LANSDOWNB, who was very iadii tinctly heard, said that, as he was one of tho trustees of the National Gallery, and as he was also connected with the Government, who felt it their duty to assist in carrying out the intentions of Mr. Turner, it might be expected that he should say a fewwords on this subject. He concurred in every. thing the noble lord had said in expressing his admiration of the talents and reputation of the, late Mr. Turner, and
he could assre the noble lord that the object of the trustees had been to give the publ tlihe full benefit of the pleasure and instruction which were to be derived from that gentle. mnan's magnificent: and munificent bequest. Although Mr. Turner could draw everything else, thereowas one thing he could not draw-amely, will. (Alaugh.) A the par ties who were interested in M r. Turner's will-the execu tors,.the family, and the representatives of the public-
agreed that it was impossible to carry out its provisions;
but7 a liberal compromise was effected, and the terms of that compromise were set forth ii an elaborate decr of the Viec-Chancelor, aainstwhieh no appeal had been made. lie thou iit, if the noble and learned lord had inspeced the house in which the decree directed that the pictures should be keptai he would have been satisfied that, had they remained thero, they would have beendoomed to utter destruction in the course of a year or twvo. 'Under these circumstances, the trasfees plaed the paintings in security in the onlI plae then at their command -what was alled the cellar of the National Galery. There was no place at present available so well calculated fo: the proper display of thepictures as Marlborough-house, but they certainly ought* not to remain there, and the Government Wrue prepared to of into effect at the earliest T)o;ible moment that part .of r Turner's will which airected that they should b placed in a separate gallery. (Hear.) If there had been any delay in doing this, it was ecuse iuquiries were now going on and plans were under cousiderntion for the consi4eration for thoerection of a ereat Y ;iomki Gallery, and It would not be advisable that ary plan ahould be hastily adopted for the Turner GrlJery whiet would interfere in any way with the larger d si-u Ele c mld mdertakc so say, however, for the present Go vs nent, and he thought be might undertake to say as ns, f *or their succesers, that the great object of Turner
2uld never be lost sight of, and that there would always be * disposition on the part of the Government to give every faoility for the study of his pictures; but whether it would be in a separate building or in a
allery built for them in connexion with the future National
llery, it was5impossible at present to say. He did not feel himself competent to discnss the legal point of the question but he hoped that the decision of Vice-Chan. ceDlor KEndersley, wvhich wvas concurred in by aDl the parties interested, would be allowed to rest undisturbed, tHesr, hear.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~er LordOVERSTONE thought that the discussionwbhich had taken place on this subject pointed out the necessity of losing no time in the erection, on a judicious plan, of a new National Gallery. By this means all the suggestions of the noble and learned lord would be satisfactorily accomplished, the public mind would be instracted, the interest of art advanced, and an opportunity would be afforded of doiniajustice to the memory of a great arist, and of displaying the national gratitude for his magnificent bequxest.
The Earl of HARDWICKE said he was sure from what he know of Sir Charles Eastlake that in writing the letter which his noble and learned ffiend had read it'never was his inteution to write anything which would be in any way painful or offensive. (Hear.) Sir Charles Eastlak-e was the last man to write a reoly of that sort. (Hear, hear.) Host probably he had writton that letter as the official answer of the Royal Academy and had therefore confmned it to a simple statement-thte legal settlement of the question put to him.
Lord ST. LEONARD'S, in reply, was 'understood to express himself satisfied withthe explanations of the noble marqui.
The subject then dropped.

The schools, which are called the Schools of St. Thomas, Charterhouse, are erected at the end of Golden-lane, at the narrowes aud almost the dirtiest part of that most narrow and dirty thoroughfare. One might almost be led to suppose that the choice of site had been guided by reference to the place where ehildren did most abound, for anything like the infantine fecundity of the surrounding neighbourhood we never witnessed. Children of a11 ages and sizes, and displaying all the various degrees of dirt and squalor, formed the very staplo of the population. They covered the footways,theyfilled the gutters, everywretched window was full of them, and courts and noisome by-ways seemed to have no other tenants. In the midst of such a fruitful neighbourhood as this the schools Are built. They are plain, unpretending edifices, substantially erected, and well and properlyl finished Inside. Their archi. tectural style is a modification of the Byzantine, but except two somewhat ornamental porches the faqade is plain, and the only effect obtained is produced by the use of coloured bricks. Great attention has been given to the fittings and school apparatus, which are most complete, and of the most substantial character, to meet the enormous wear and tear of such a colony of children. On the ground atorey is the infant school, 66 feet by 29, and 13 feet in height, and a well-paved and airy playground. On the first floor is the girls' school, over the infant school, and of the same dimensions and a lecture-room 28 feet by 14, but with a recess for a gallery. On the top storey is the boys' school, 67 feet by 30 feet, 13 feet high at the sides, and 17 feet in the middle, where it occuples part of the space in the roof, and a lecture-room 28 feet by 14 feet. The necessary hat and cloak rooms, washing-rooms, &c., are attached to each school, and rooms for a porter and his wife. There is a basement storey, containing kitchen, scullery, &e., and the heating apparatus. Desk accommodation is provided for 264 boe; and a similar number of girls are provided for at desks m working classes and in the gallery- 372 infants are also accommodated in the ga)lerles and at the writing deskh, giving a total of 900childrenin alL The roomsareweulighted with gas reflectors, so that ample provision is made for evening classes for adultsandthosewhose occupattionsprevent theirattendancebyday. The cost of the building, induding wa!rmng and school fittings, but exclusive of the cost of the site, is ,681L Mr. Heslket is the architect, and is the same gentlemanwhohasbeen engagedbytheRev. Mr. Rogers inthe erection of the other schools in tho district, which, together with these just finished, can accommodate no less than 2,600 children or adults at one time.
The ceremony yesterday took place in the Girls' Schoolroom, on the frst-floor, which was quite crowded with a numerous attendance of les and gentlemen.
Soon after 3 o'clock his Royal Highness Prince Albert, accompanied by the Prince of Wales, entered the room, where they were greeted with prolonged cheering, especially the youthful heir-spparent, whoee appearance seemed to create amost lively sensation. Accompanying, orinattendance on their Royal l "hnesses,werethe Arch shopof Canterbury, tho Bishop of London, the Very Rev. theDeans of Windsor, St. Paul'; and Salisbury, the Rev. W. Ro'ers, the Marquis of Aorcorn, the Earl GrannUe, lord Robert Grosvenor, 1M.P., Major-General Grey, &ic
Tl'he Prince Consort having taken his seat, with the Prince of Wales on his right,
The Rev. Mr. BOGiacS read the following address to his Royal Highnes:
"`}ay ft please youmRoya Hfighneas,

HisRoyal BighnessPrince AunI Treplied, in a slow, clear voice, as follows :-hlr. Rogers, and gentlemen, promoters and supporters of these schools, I thank you heartily for your kind and cordial welcome. I rejoico at the opportunity which his this day been afforded to me of visiting this noble establishment, and my satisfaction in doing so is increased by the circumstance that my visit occurs r.t a period of its existence-when the state of useful development to which by your exertions it has attalned is about, by a continuance of tho same exertions, to receive a still wider extension. (Hear, hear.) In the progress of these schools, struggling, I may say, from the most lowly and humble beginnings up to their present noble dimensions, we find a striking exemplification of the Divine truth, that the principle of good once sown is not destined to lie dormant, but that, like the grain of mnustardseed, it is calculated to extend and develope itself in an ever-increasing sphere of usefulness, and we may confidently hope that what you have now effected, following this universal law, will not be limited in its results to the immediate objects of your charitable exertions, but that it will provo the means of diffusing untold blessings among the most remote gene. rations. (Hear, hear.) For you, Mr. Rogers, who have been mainly instrumental, and at great personal sacrifice, in bringing about this great good, and for thoso who have stood by you, and contributed by their support to the success of your efforts, thero can, I am sure, be no higher source of gratification than in the contemplation of your own work. (Hear.) The reflection that you have been the instrnment, under Divine providence, of conferring up;on the poor and needy in this vast district that greatest of all boons, the means of obtaining for their children the blessings of education and of religious instruction, without which any lasting success in lifo or any permanent amelioration of their lot would seem hopeless ; and stiU further, the feeling that this inestimablo blessing will be secured in a yet higher degree to their children's children, will carry with it its own best reward. (Much cheering.) Still it will be a source of legitimate pride and satisfaction to yon to know that your labours have not been unobserved, bat that your noble and Christianlike exertions to benefit those who cannot help themselves have attracted the notice and admiration of your Sovereign, and of those who aro deputed under her to watch over and promote the education andmoral welfare of her people. (Hear.) The means which you have adopted to effect your work of benevolence appear no lees deserving of commendation than the object itself. You have not bsen content with the bare attempt to force, perhaps, upon unwilling recipieats a boon the value of which might not be appreciated, but you have wisely sought to work upon the convictions of the parents of the children you wish to benefit by extendingyour assistance to those who by a small contribution out of their hardly won earnings have proved that they aro awake to a sense of the vast importance it is to their oflfpringthatthe meansof being fitted to pss successfully through life, and by honest indu,try to boetter their worldly condition, should bo brought withia their reach. It is a source of high personal gratification to me that I have been enabled by my presence here this day, and by that of the Princo of WIles (great cheering), to mark not only my own appreciation of your labours, but also the deep ,interest which the Queen takes in the well
being of the poorest of her subiects, and that gratification will be greatly enhanced if by this public eepressionof the sympathy of the Queen andof her famly and Government this noble cause shall be still further advanced. Most earnestly do I pray that the same success which has hitherto blessed your labours may continue to attend your future progres, and that your example may stimulate other locali' ties to emulate your useful efforts. (Long continued cheers which were again and again renewed.)
The 127th Psalm was then sung by the children of the school with admirable good taste aud feeling, and, prayers having been read b,y the Bishop of London, the blessing was pronounced, and his Royal Bighness Prince Alberb iformally declared the schools opened amid great applause. The national anthem was then sung with the same care and sweetnershy the children, though the general effect of their harmony was somewhat marred by the voluntary efforts of a numerous chorus. His lloyal Highness Prince Albert and the Prince of Wales were greeted as they drove away with heart cheers fron numerous crowd which had colectcd outside tho schools.

RAILWAY YNTBLLIGENL7I.
(IRRAT WVqp.,D&TQ
A saeCals meting of this oompany'was hold yesterday at the railway station, Paddington, to consider a Bill now bWe fore Parliament for enabling the Great Western, Bristo and Exeter, asd South Devon Railway Comnanios to afforid further assstance towards the completioni o
Railway between Plymouth and Traro *for extending tha time for the com etion thereof; and lor other purposes; Mr. Mltls in tho ZPNll.
The advertisement convening the meeting having bcei read,
The CElrAs stated that the meeting was convened rin compliance with the standing orders of the Houte of Lords, and that the object of the bill had been approved at the last half-year meeting.
Mfr. Saunders, the secretary, then read the preamble ant boeds of the Dill, from which it appeared tho Cornwall Come pany had agreed to lease the line to tho Great Western, Bristol and Exeter, and South Devon Railway Companies, on condition of the associated companies asssting the Corn.
WaU Company with their credit to complete the railway.' The funds now at the disposal of the Cornwall Company being insufficient, it was deemed desirable, not only in re.
ect of the public, but of the associated compames, that e railory suould bo completed as soon as possible, and fot that purposo that the Cornwall Company should be antho. rized to sue 15,000 new prefereneo shares of 201. each, to rai6e 300,000h., and to be entitled, under the guarantee of the assocated companies, to interest at a rato not exceeding 5 percent. per annum. The Bill extends the time for thu completion of the railway to the 23d of June, 1360. The term of the lease is to be continued until the associated companies aro fully indemnified in respect to their engag. mnent with the Cornwall Company.
The CHAMIAIr, in replyto a question from Mr. MA=sS, stated that, the total amount-roposed to be raised was 300,0004., of which 125,0D00. h been already agred to b
the associated companies, andl there only remained175,000?4 of additional eapita trSatise to choempleterthe line.
Mr. EDWARDS was o p posed to any increase in the Xad bitities of thecompany, usess the directors had pledea themselves at former meetings not to enter into any fulrtheR liabilities.
The CHAxMssi said, the whole amount of additional liabilty, if the worst came to the worst, woulonot ba more than 2,000l a-year; that would bring the Mointcj profitablo operation and make that good which was already advanced. They had been invited to grant guarantees to other lines, but ad invariably refueed them. The Cormwall was not a new engagement, but merely for the completion of an old one; the principle had already been sanctioned by ordquiry meetings of the proprietors, and they were now re. quirea to give their formal assent to the Bill, in order to enable the Cornwall Company to complete the line.
Mr. SAUNDERS explained that the three companies had already guaranteed the interest on a certain amount of Corn. wall ebentures, and the proposed measure would enable them to open the line for traffic, which would no doubt pay the interest on the 375,0004, and probably on the whole of the new capital; at all events, there was about 750,000h. expended by the CornwaU Company, for which they would not receive a farthing until the whole of these liabilities were provided for. The length of line which it was intend to brmg into operation was G1 miles.
The CHAINRsA said, they should bear in mind that it was not an advance of moncy, but aii intervention of credit. The,y had no idea of going into any fresh liability.
lr. EDWARDS thought, as it was not a fresh liability, they could do nothing more than assent to the proposition.
Mr. lI&xMS said that, unless the undertaking were come ctcd, the sum expended on it would be a total los3. The
lravvaU Company could not finish their railway withoua the assistknce of the associated companies, and he would therefore be happy to move the resolution approving the Bill for enabling the Great Western, the Bristolyand Exeter, and South Devon Railway Companies to afford farther assistance to the Cornwall Company to complete their line from Plymouth to Truro, and to extend the time for the completion of the railway.
e motion was seconded and carried unanimously,
formal resolution, approving and confirming the agree. ment enterod into between the Cornwal and the associated companies in respect of promoting the Bil now pending in
atiamreat and or earrying out the objects thereof, was unimnously adopted.
In reply to a question it was stated that there was no doubt the sum mentionei would be sufficient to complete the Cornwall Railway.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.,
SCOTTISE NORTH-EASTERN.
The reaort of the directors of this cc(.pany states that the receipts or the half-year ending tho 31st of January last amounted to 89,8831 and the working expenses to 43,568&, leaving a balance of 46,315 Of this sum the Aberdeen Company takes 32,420. and the Scottish Mldland 13,8941. The net sum available for dividend on the Aberdeen capital stock for the half-year is 9,099L, after charging against revenue L,1644, being a whole year's surplus profits payable to the Arbroath and Forfar Company, one-half of which only i3 applicable to the past half-year. The siulm required to pay the dividend on the Gper cent. preference stock being 8 3004, but taking into account the deficiency of 1,7121. shown in the last - half-year's revenue cconnt, the amount divisible is 9134 short of meeting the dividend on that stock. The fell dividend, however, wliU be paid on the 15th of May noxt. Out of the sum of 11,411. appll. cable as dividerad on Scottish Midland stock the directors propose to pay a dividend at the rate of 3i per cent. per
annum, leaving 3924 to be carried to the reserve fund. A. marked increase, amounting to 6,8364, has taken plaes in the revenue from passengers, but the increased rates on traffic between England and Scotland have continued to affbet tho through traffic very prejudicially, and there hag been a considerable falling off under this head, amointei, to 3,2971, as compared with the correspondaing tri
of last year. The locomotive expenses have been reduced by 3,3104, as compared with the corresponding half-year' The total working expenses are 45 per cent, of the revenue, or 48-4 per cent., mcluding rates, taxes, and passenger duty,' being 4 8 per cent, less than those of the corresponding period of last year. The average rate of interest paid by the company istill as high as 4l 16s. 2d. per cent. As the bonds fatl due bearing a high rate of interest, the directors will have no difficulty inreplcing them at lower rates. The business of the transfer department is conducted on sound principles, and the stock and transfer registers are strictly accurate, Asunm of 5044 has been debited to the present re. venue accounttowards supplying the place of such engines as may become unfit for use. The directors have selected Forfaras the most eligible situation for the site of the new workshops. The directors will ask authority from the meet. ing on the 25th inst. to issue deferred dividend warrants for the half-year's dividend falling due on the 1st of May next on the Aberdeen 7 per cent, preference stock of the com. pany. The expendituro on capital account to the 31st of vanuary last in respect of the Aberdeen line amounted to 1,856,0344, and of the Scottish Midland to 667,4071, to. gether 2,523,4412. The expenditure on the joint account amounted to ll9,v55l4, including 46,05331 for rolliine stocl; The revenue account shows that 89,853C., or 48-21'Sd. per train mfSe, was received, and 43,668i., or 23-381d. per train mile, expended, leaving a balance of 46,3154
CHESTER AND HOLYHEA1D.
It appears that in consequence of an unavoidable dell,
in closing the accounts of this company for the past halfyear, arismingout of the recent arrangement with the London and North- western Company, and the necessity of adjusting all prior claims it has been found necessary to defer the iue ofthe usual alf-yearly statements of accounts. The meeting advertised to be held to. day will be held pi-o fornva only for the purpose of an adjournment to;a futmre day.

Thursdy Evening.
The English funds have not been active to-day, Ibut the slight recovery of yesterday has been fairly
2aintained. Consols for money, which closed last evening at 93i to i, were first quoted 93 to i, but aome purchases caused a return to 93t to j, and the final transactions wvere at 93k for money, and 932 to jI for the 8th of A pril. The supply of money in the Etock-} :change was again comaparatively abundant, and the rate for ahort loans on Government secunities was 54 to 6 percent. Bank Stock was quoted =2O to 222, with dividend; India Stock left off 221 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 988 to i ; India Bonds, 4s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills, ls. discount to 2s. premium.
Both in the discount-market and at the Bank to-day the demand for money was less active.
The operations in foreign securities continue numerous, but Mexican attracts the principal attention. There was less firmness to-day in the quotations, although the fluctuations were not important. For money the bargains were at 24, and for the account at 24i, 23k, 24, 23i, and 24k. Turkish was steady, prices being fairly supported to the close. In the Six per Cents. the transactions for the account were at 98k, 98, and 98i. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were dealt in at 101 and 101A. The other business comprised :-Brazilian Five per Cents., 102i; Granada Deferred, 6; and J; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45J. A large trans. action also took place in the Portuguese Loan of 1856, which has come into demand on account of its cheapness relatively to the other description. Russian Five Cents., 107k and J: the Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 97i and 98; Sianish Three per Cents., for account, 41i; Venezuela, 37; the Deferred, 14k; Belgian Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 655; and Dutch Two-and-a-Ealf peor Cents., G5.
The ~'nal quotations of the French IThree per Cents. "on the Paris Bourse this evenmg were 70f. 65c. for money, and 70f. 90c. for the account, showing a fall of a-quarter per cent.
It has transpired that Rnssia has taken more active steps than England to establish telegraphic communication with India. According to private and reliable advices just received, she made a contract previously to the termination of the late war for a line from Nicholaieff vid the Caspian Sea to Ispahan and Herat. It has since been in progress, and although, under the secrecy enforced in that couniry, no conjecture can be formed as to the probable period of its completion, the contingelicy is not impossible of our finding before long that she is in regular receipt of news from our possessions weeks previously to lts arrival in London.
According to some impressions; the recent treaty bettveen Mexico and the Uited States is not likely to come into effect. At the last advices the session of Congress at Washington was within a few hours of its termination, and the treaty had not been submnitted. Mr. Buchanan, the new President, will Immediately upon assumning office call together the Eenate, which, as an executive branch of the Government, must act upon all his appointments, and to wvhich he could submit for ratification a treaty strictly so called. But, as that said to have been concluded with Mexico contemplates a loan of money, it seems doubtful *whether under the constitution it would be valid without the sanction of Congress. The latter body, unless specially called together, will not meet until December next, and the prospect, therefore, with regard to the adjustment of the question is uncertain. The treaty was negotiated without instructions, and from the hesitation of the expiring Cabinet to bring it forward for completion an assumption is entertained that it Is regarded by them with dissatisfaction.
Thlle precise amount shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Pera for India and China on the 20th is 787,5871., of which 628,9951. is silver for Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, and Singapore, and 147,3371. for Hongkong, Canton, and Shanghai. The gold is 11,2551. for Alexandria, Ceylon, Madras, and Calcutta.
At a half-yearly Court of Bank Stock proprietors held to-day a dividend of 4k per cent., free of in come-tax, was declared. The profits for the iix months ending the 28th of February have been 686,3301., making the amount of the "rest" on that day 3,719,8551. After the payment of the dividend the " rest" will be 3,064,9701. In answer to questions, the Governor stated that the report of the directors being about to allow interest upon deposits is incorrect, and that the business at the west-end branch may be regarded as successful.
The Thames Steamtug and Lighterage Company, formned last summer for the purpose of introducing improvements in the goods traffic of the river, and which commenced operations on the 1st of January by taking over the business of Messrs. Keen and Blake, have just started a trial steam tugboat, of three feet draught, with engines by Messrs. James 'Watt and Co. of 50-horse power. Two others are to be ready within a month, and they are expected to produce a great effect in expediting the movemeiit of the heavy quantities of goods which now faid their way to the Thames from the London and North-Western and the Great Western Railways.
It is understood that the tidal trains between london and Paris, by way of Folkestone and Boulogi e, will be recommenced, at the latest, on the 15.h of next month, and possibly on the 1st. It is dificult to understand tho grounds on which the South-Eastern and Frencb Northern Companies allow an interruption of these trains to take place. The result is that during the winter mouths the ceonstantly increasing traffic between London and Boulogne is naturally attracted to another route. The number of boats between London-bridge and Boulogne has been increased from three to four a week, and will be further extended to six a week each way next month. The goods traffic is largely augmiienting, and indicates a considerable extension in the international trade.
The following refers to a note inserted yesterday regarding the conduct of Mr. Lionel Gisborne on the India telegoraph question. If Mr. Gisborne can brirng forward unqucstionable evidence to impeach any of its statements on matters of fact he will be entitled to space for the purpose, otherwise the subject must drop:-

Messrs. Perkins, Baecn, and Co. have asserted that the annouicemenit in the city article of Wedneeday that the Government expected to be unable for a month to issue new Exchequer-bills to the amounit of about G00,0001. against those recently seut in for renewal, owing to a portion of the plates azd paper having been destroyed at the fire on their prenuses,is a "most erroneous statement." Therewas no error in the matter. The Government, under date the 14th inst., intimated to the holders of bills to the amount of 726,7001. that, as the fresh paper would have to be manufactured and the plates to he repaired, it was " feared a delay of a month must take place before the new bils can be issued," and it has since been officially mentioned that the time might probably extend to six weeks. Messrs. Perkins, Bacon, and Co., in their hurry apparently to palliate the neglect of precautions on the part of the Exchequer to have an extra supply ready in case of accident, have allowed themselves to imitate the reckless examples of unqualified contradiction which, on points of administrative detail, have of late been

Tbere has been rough weather during the tast day or two, but a favourable change has now taken place, and field operations will, no doubt, proceed satisfactorily.
The wheat trade in this dist'rict has lost the busyant tone it had a week or two ago, and, although In some instances the beet samples have made last oweek's prices, there has been a general declne of about Is. pr quarter. At Spaldint, yesterday, there was a slow sale at that abatement. At Lynn, on te samne day, the Supply of wheat being short and the condition improved, a fir demand waa experienced for atl descrlptions at fnily last week's wices. Barley of a good malbing quality gets scarce, and fully maintains former rate. Otherkinds of sprng corn'bave have bcen somewhat dull and drooping.

Lord J. Russell In The City.
- LORD J. RU7SSLL IN TEE CITY.
A very crowded meeting assembled at the London Tavern yesterday, and, although the announcementadureaaed to the friends anda spporters of Lord Jolun Rusell merelY stated that the neble lord would meet them, it was understood to bh a counter-demonstration to the recent proceedings of the London Registration Association for the pmrpose of obtaining his lordship's re-election, notwithstanding tho studied omission of his name from the lit of vandidates pnu forward by the assoolition,
Among those gentlermen who appeared upon tho platform v ero Mr. Moffatt, Mf.P., Mr. W. Leaf, Ir. Bennoch, Mr. J. A. Hankey, Mr. T. A. Hankey, jun., Mr. W. S. Lindsay, M.P., Yr. W. hr. Christie, Mr. Pritchard, Mfr. John Abel Smith, MLP., Sir Thomas Philips, Serianot Parry, Alderman Salomons, Alderman Humphery, Mr. Cassell, Kr. Whitehurst, Sir David Dundas, Mr. H. C. Roberts, Mr. Samuel Warren, M.P., Mr. J. Whiteside, and Mr. George Moore.
Upon the motion of Mfr. M1offatt, Mr. Thomson Hankey wasvotedintothe chair. Whenthe cheeringwhich greeted Lord John Russell's appearance had subsided,
The CHAmPsa? said he would make no apology for hay. ing accepted that office, because he should consider himself nuworthy of the cause which he had always advocated if he hesitated for a moment to promote, as far as hig humble abilities permitted, the return of Lord John Russell for the city of London. (Cheers.) They were met to receive and welcome one of the oldest Reformers (renewed cheers) * a gentleman and a statesman whose name alono would be a passport to the favour of all who valued dvil and religious liberty, but whose devoted services as their representative gave him a peculiar claim upon the citizens of London. He hoped that before they separated they wouid agree with him in testifying by their vote that they were not villing to allow Lord John Russell to be turned out of the city, and that when the election took place they vould follow that up by returning him at the
ead of the poll. (Loud cheers.) So strongly had he felt it his duty to join in paying a compliment to their excellent and noble representative that he had left theplace where he was actively canvassing his constituents agaiust a powerful opponent in order to be present at the meeting. He would not detain them by eulogizing the great man they were met to hear. The address which he would make to them would doubtless be acceptable not only to those present, but to the citizens at large, and he should feel it a stigma upon every reformer in London if, in consequence of any differencesof opinion which might by possibility have arisen, their failure to return the noble lord should give the impression that some of them had deserted the cause to which they had been so much attached. (Hear, hear.) Ever since he had had the honour of a seat in Parliament he had beena supporter of Lord Palmerston, and he considered it no derogation from his consisteney that he now came forward as the advocate of Lord J. Rtussell. In him, remembering his great services, they still placed confidence. To him they still looked s their champion, and as the champion of pro. gress and reform. (Renewed cheers.) In concltsion, he asked them most attentively and with the greatest possibla silence to listen to the address of the noble lord.
Thereceptionof Lord J.Russellwas enthusiastic, butwhen the cheering had subsided there was some slight disorder in the further corners of the room, which compelled the noble lord to repeat three or four times the firsb sentenoe of his speech. It happened that the sentence referred to the Re. gistration Asbociation, and the interzuption was for the moment erroneously attributed to some of its members, When it was dlscovered that it only proceeded from a desire to see his lordship, and tha he disturbers Iere quite satis.
iedbyhiselevation onaneasy chair,whichserved both in purpose and appearance as a rostrum, the solemnity of tone ncident to fancied oppoition gave wray to a smile of good humour at the necessity for such an expedient.
Lord J. IiussKLL then spoke as follow vs-I come to appeal to you, the electors of the city of London, against a decres of the Registration Association which pretends to represent you. I come here to appeal against a decision of that association, which has excluded me, most unfairly, I think, as far,as they are concerned, from the nomination. The association met, and without any intimation to me, without any warning of any sort, they devised a resolution that four persons connected by commercial pursuits with the city of London should serve them in the next ParliAment. I am not going to discuss that resolution, but I beg you to observe-as I think every one must have observed-that, without making a direct attack on me, it was meant indirectly to exclude me from tho honour of representing you. The association, having
gain met on Tuesday last, proceeded to the nomination of four candidates together, thereby preventing that fair decision which the nomination of each candidate would have afforded. They again decided that they would exclude me Indirectly, withoutl allowing any discussion of the question whether I was unworthy to represent you any longer. They heard, moreover, a gentleman who is one of the four nominated candidates, and who made a speech of three-quarters of an hour's length, which oonsisted chiefly of a contrast between his votes and mine and of a censure upon my conduct in Parliament. As I complain of being unfairly treated, let me say that if a gentleman were disposed to put with his butler, his coach. man, or his gamekeeper, or if a merchant were diposed to I part with an old servant, wawehouisemid, *clark, or even
a porter, he would say to him, "John (loud laughter), I think your faculties are somewhat decayed; you are growing old; you havemadeseveral mistakes, and I think of putting a young man from Northampton ia your place." (Laughter and cheers.) I think a gentleman would behave in that way to his servant, and thereby give John an opportunity of answering that he thought his faculties were not so much decayed, and that he was able to go on, at all events, some five or six years longer. (Cheers.) That opportunity was not given to me. The question was decided in my absence, without any in'imation to me; and I come now to ask you and the citizens of London to reverse that decision. (Cheers.) Proud as I am of your confidence, it has occurred -to me in later years that the great question of free trade, upon which I first obtained it, having been settled, I might no longer encounter the labour or achieve the honour of representing you. But this does not appear to me an occasion upon which I can honourably shrink from the duties which are to be performed. (Cheers.) [A Voice.-How about Vienna?] Probably most of you saw in the Chinese Exhibition some years ago three large figures with "Past," "Present," and "Future" written og them in Chinese characters. I wil allude to the past, to the present, and, as far as one can anticipate, to the future. With regard to the past, I think it would be a proof of vanity in me if I were to attempt to enumerate the acts which I believe are useful to the country which I have brought forward, and which are now recorded in the statute book. (Cheers.) But, gentlemen, if Imay ive a few of them, there are-the repeal of te Test and orporation Act (hear, hear), the reform of Parliament (hear hear), the reform of municipal corporations, the settlement of the tithe question, the Marriage Act, by whichDissenters were relieved from what they thought unjust restrictionsmeasures respecting Ireland, giving them franchises vhich they had not before enjoyed; measures relating to the reduction and equalization of the sugar duties, by which the people of this country have had that article, almost an article of necessity, at a far cheaper rate than in former times ; and the repeal of the Navigation Laws. I thin], that enumeration may be fairly set in the balance against some secondary and desultory votes which Mr. Raike% Currie made a matter of comment
(Cheers.) But, gentlemen, passing to that which is the immediate present, I beg to call your attention to the course which I have pursued in this session of Parliament with regard to three very important questions. The first guestion related to the Budget. It was oijected by Mr. D)israeli and Mr. Gladstone that the Bndget did not give sufficient relief to the people, and very able speeches they made in support of that proposition. But it seemed to me that the Government had acted fairly; that they were endeavouring to relieve gradnaly those burdens which had bcen caused by the war, and that establishments could not be reduced suddenly, although they ought to be reduceod largely. I gave my vote and I spoke as strongly as I could in favour of the propositions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. (Cheers.} That at least showed that I was not disposed to view with disfavour, or to encounter with opOsition, the Government of Lord PPlmerston. But there came another question, and that question related to the extension of the right of voting to householders of 101. in counties as it is in boroughs. (Cheers.) I had on one occasion, if not on muore than one occasion, opposed that motion, wishing myself to bring forward a mnch larger and more comprehensive measure for the increase of the constituent body and for the settlement of some questions respecting the reform of Parliament. Bat as the measure which I wished to bring forward appeared to mc not likely to meet with favour at the present moment (on vvhich I shaLl say a word or two by and by), I supported Mr. Locke Kin's motion as introdncing a measure of ,;rest
pracoical advantage which might be exceedingly useful both in satisfying the mind sof those who are thus excluded and
in givinggreater weight to the county representation in Parliament. (Cheers The motion was strongly opposed by the Prime Mincster. Lrd Palmerston declared very explicitly that he was not for any compre. hensive reform, and that he did not approve of a bitby-bit reform (Laughter.) Well, gentlemen, we divided, and the case was exactly this -There were 21 persons holding office and 10 adherents of the Government, making 31, who voted aainst the motion. There were 10 others, all, I think, holding offie, who were absent. If those 41. hadl bee joine to 'our 179, we should have been 220, and the opposition to the motion would only have counted 160. We should have had a ma0ority of 60, which would probably have inreasd in future divisions, and that measure might have been carried. (Cheers.) It was not carried, as I tell yon, on account of tehe -opposition of the Governrment, and in that division there appeared against It Lord Palmersten and hsis colleagues, Mr. Dlsraeli, Mr. Walpole, and Sir J. Pikington, and Mr. Glastone and Mr. Sidney Herbert. Do I say that this was a " disgaceful coalition," do I sa.y that it was au. " infamous combination," or do I say that it was a "fortultousconcourse of atoms?" Far from it. I aythat if Lord ;Palmerston and his collegnes, and Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Sidney Herbert, thought M.r Locke King's motion wonld be injurious, they were right to consuIt their own opinlon, to follow the dictates of their own judgment, even though it maight bring them Into the same lohb q with gentlemen from whom they differed. (Cheers.) Tis at lent, may furnish some key to the next questlon on which I am about to touch-namely, the question reLating to China. I beg to say, in theofirst place, that I believe the charge of a " dlsgraceful combination" of an " unscranpuons eoalition" ls utterly false, (Cheers man faint hisses.) For my own part, I said to one gent leman who consulted me be.
fore the debate began, "el_si about the worst person yam Icould Ask to advis yu, because [ have not yet read the p"r, ad hae nt "Asupmy own mnind.' There was one gentleman with whom I spoke from time to timen-ir iF. Baring-a mnan of sas rupujous honour, of as strict. Integrty, of as sound pA*kiotism as any maan who sits In the House of Commons-anld we cAme separately to the opinxion th&~ :go radig llthe lpsers Sir J. Bowning was not juUi intemaue of ',Aolenee he had taken (hisse), and therefore that it wasnot consistent with the charater, the reputation, aind the honour of the Britita nation toa&pDrove of those proooedings. (Hora, hear.) I can answerr Flor yslf and. a j 1 jjs~ for some 48 gentlemen whlo sit ting an the Liberal side of the H'ous-'on the right band of the Speaker-cume to the same conclusion, and gave the same vote as Sir F. Baring, that noneofushadany concertor combination with anyotherparty. I knowuothing, of course, with respect to the views of Lord Derby, Sir James irhm n, r Gladstone, buLt they have denLiedl ("1Ok !")-they have denied, on their psrt, any coalition or combination uponi that question of China, snd I Thi*nk,a meno of honour, they deserve to be believe'd. (Hear, hear.) Bat, gentlemen, persons maiy combine in a very different manner. Several persons may combine in order to break into a house. SeveraL persons may combine in a juryioom to find them guilty of burglary1. (Laughter.) The one combination is very bad and very wncked, bat the ether is right san praiseworthy, and belongs to the ordinary administration of justice. (Lond cheers) sTow, itis tlat latter combination which took place in the ease of wrhich I am speaking. We thought, on reading the papers, that we could come to no other opinion. A great many persons, no doubt, belioved that the Govemnment did right ; a great many others believed that, although the G-overnment haa not been exactly right, it was very unadvisable to give A vote which miight displace them from offlce.- Upon that question let me read to yotu the opinion expressed by a gentLeTna of great consistency and highly repeted in the House of Commons, where as a Reformer he has had a seat for a great number of years. I allude to Mr. Ellice, the member for Coventry. (A.Voice, "Give us your own opinion.") This gentleman was- almost the only
pesn who, holding a high position in the House and not be~gin office, gpvc a vote against the motion maA by Mr. Cofn adin addresing his constituents he uses this
I did not approve, and I sincerelyv lament, the exreeneasures to which our civil and military authorities in China carried their proceedlings on their own responisibility, and without diret instructions from home." That is, in other words, Mr. Cobden's resolution. And therefore the only question-and I admit it is often a very difiult one for members of the House of Commons to solve-was, "1Shall we or shall we not, disapproving what has been done, record our disapurebation by our vote, at the risk either of a dissolution of PaLrliament or of a change of GovernmentVT There have been many occaions I must ow,in my long political life, in which I have voted either to' keep aGovernment in office, or to co-operate
wihm dpry where my opinion did not exactly coincide with my v ote. But I hold that questions Sometimes arise
oftersucs g=v importance, and touching so deeply the Intee~tsof t iscuntry and of mankind, that there is no other course open to youL but to give a vote accordlimg to your convictions; audiit seemed to me that the commnence. ment of hostilities-the burning down of pLart Of a populOUS cit7-thLe putting an end to the peaceful and amicable reIations of trade, ian exchanging thiem for the operations of war, consUtituted a question of. such paramount import&nece that I could not ito otherwise than make my vote agree wi'th mny opminion. (Cheers and hisses.) Well, if that was my course, far be it from mae to blame those who,thinkIug that the Government might have caused serious e'vils in China if they had not appreved the ryoceedings of Sir 3. Bowring, felt it their duty to adopt a &ffelrent one. I freely grant that it was a difficult questron for them to resolve, andi lapplaud the conscientious motives upon which they acted. But what I do protest against is that many men on both sides hAving, no douLbt on this, as on most other occasions, voted on party grounds-and, perhaps, more of them in aupport of the Government than against it- the conduct of the majority of the House of commons should be indiscriminately stigmatized as factious and unprincipledl, when unijuestionabiy a great number of those who composed that majority, having thoroughly investigateI thae qucstion, could not conscientiously come to any other conclusion than the one they adopted. (Hlear, hear.) To reverT to what I said a few minutes ago, if this is to be denounced as an infamous and disgraceful coalition, would not the same description apply to those who voted against 1r. Locke King's motion, differing as they did in party, and opposed as they wore in their general political sympathies? (Cheers and a laugh.) I now come to the idea repro. sented by the th-ird statue-viz., the question of the future. (Hear, hear.) You will perhaps recolect that the figure to which I have alluded had in its handsa closed book, signifyin, that it is difficult for us to read the pages o futurity. ow, I am sure you would form a bad opnon of me if, having hitherto acted according to my
sneof duty to the country on the various questions and measures which have comae before us, I were now to tell you that I would change that conduct, and for the sake of obtaining votes at the ensuing election would renounce any of the principles that I have heretofore professed. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me that we have three qnestions now
ut to the counz Thefirst*s whether LordPalmortn's Goernment s=houd- be supported, or whether it should be repheed by any other Govemnment. (Cries of "No, no I" followed by "-Yes!" andl some confusion.) Mty decidedi opinion is that Lord Palmerston's Government ouaght to be supported (hear, hear) - and if I had to choose between Lord PAlmerston atthe iead of the Liberal pary and Lord Derby at the head of the Conservative party, I shlould think it myduty to give my adhesion to the formerJE(Har.) Thesecond question which has been raised by'th ads made to the country hy men of all, shadles of opinion is whether Lord Palmerston should be supported, irrespective of any prin-
cipesli my profess or anymeasures he mixprepose. (".o-To-that question I should iive as de.cde a cea two. Bu~~~t, gentlemnen, 'there, is "a' tlurd question, and it is, I think, the most important of all. Puting asidle both the first and second ques-tions asimerely relating to personsmad to Ministers, it may beaskedi whether the great Liberal and Rleform party of tho city of London, and of allthe boroughs and counties throughout the kingdom, should hold fast by their principles, or whether they shouLld now abandon them. (Cheers.)1 believe you wil anticipate the answer I am about to give, for my own part, to that question. I hold that nothing could beso dangerous to that ,~eat party asto do anofthe principles upon which te have risen-; an htif you have what is called a Lbrlpr
which is not .kie advocate of any Liberal measures,
whichisahot faithful. to the cause of civil and roligious
librty you may be sure thaedownfallof that party is at had (Cheers.) It is only by remaininLg true to your banners-it is only by continuing the cours which you have for so many years victoriously pursued, that T'Ou. can maintain, the confidence of the couLntry, and contribute to its welfare and happiness. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, there is one question on which a present colleague of mine has beenx the embodimnent of religious liL-erty. I mean Baron ipRothcinent Hear,hea of I may,pteirhas,be tlhought iprothcild.t ame to speako many,ohe c-audi'date .vut myself, but I trust Baron Bothsachild, as being the representative of that great principle which you took up and have hitherto so firzaly mitained, will still be the symbol of your continued fidelity toth cause ofi re-ligious lbrty, and still remain the emblem of youar steadfast wish to see it mnade perfect in this country. (Cheers.) I am toldl that that subject, thaough it has been a long -while under discussion, has not made any great progress; but if you look back to the great questions which hiave been previously settled-to Catholic emancipation, to the repeal of the Teat and Corporation Act, or to Parliamentary reform-you will see how long they have had to struggle through the fire of puifdic opinion, and that it was not until that public opinion had become not only united, buxt energetic, that the Legislaturo was at length 2nduced, to sanctionL thei adptin. Hlear, hear.) There is another topio on which I trust the next Parliamnent will offer a firm front, namely, the retrenchment of our national expenditure. (Hear, hear.) I believe the estimates of the p resent year exceed, by more than fire mifllions, those of 183. I have said that I do not wish to hurry the Govemrnment in their reductions; but I think they ought to prepare in the course of the present year for such reductions as will enable them to make the income balance the expenditure, and, if possible, relieve trade from some of the taxes which press upon it. Hear hear.) Now, it is only by such retrenchments that usther progress can be miade ini that wise policy which, Stimulating industry by the repel Of the duties on ghlas, on sosp, and many other articles, has already contributted So much to the wdfare of the people. I cannot see why if du cownomy is practised, we may not in the next year allo
the duty on tea to fall to Is. per lb., as was proposed some years ago, and also lower the duly on sugar to the minimum. scale, likewise enacted by former legislation. (Hear, hear.) I now arrive, gentlemen, at the great question of Reform. And here I may observe that Lord Derby, as the leader of the great Conservative p arty,lhas traced certai limits within which he will permit legislation to go, and beyond which he will not suffer the Government to carry their measures. I refuse, for ml part, to be bound by those limitations. (Hear, hear.) cannot admit t'hat political reform ought to be excluded from our consieration ; and, as I voted for Mr. Locke rKing's motion in the presen Paliaent soI am disposed, if re-elected, ;to Preatl bnTthat voteinthe new Parliament. (Cheers.) I lokalo to othr extensions of the righit of votingf
for members of the ounse of Commons. I believe that safe and judicious extensions of the franchise wiU conduce to the benefitof the country. It s only by that means that an object which has been much discussed of late, viz.- administrative reform, can be effectuaUy achieved. (Hear, hear.) Parliament two sessions ago carried an addres to the Crown touching admioistrative reform; but unless we have a further enlargement of the suffrage I doubt whether any adequate measures will be taken to give practical effect to ot. (m Huc, heae' and some confuslon.) I will not detain yomuch longer; but there is one subleat with regard to which my conduct has boen somewhat criticised. I allude to the question of church-rates. (Hear, hear.) I am quite aware that church-rates are felt as a grievance by the great body of the Dissenters, and that they aro likewise objected to by many Churchmen. My course on that question has been based upon this ground ; that in abolishing this impost, if it can be abolished, yon ought at the same time to do that which is just towards the Church establishment of this country. In Scotland yon have a pro. vision bylaw for the repair of the curehes-in Ireland,too, you have a simnilr provision, and I think you ought to have one also in England. But it by no means follows that sach a provson need retain the form of church-rates, and if any measure can be devised by which those rates can bo abolished and due provision made for tho purposes of the established Church, I shtould be wiUing, most willing, to aid in its introduction and adoption. (" ear, hear," and confusion.) But gontlemen, asI bae already told yon, ifI am elected as your represontative in Parliament, I must go there, as I have hitherto done, free to act according to my general convictions. (Cheers.) I cannot consent to go to the House of Commons fettered and gagged. I must have full liberty to Tote according to the opinion I may form at the time of what is best for the interests of the country. That conrse, I am sure, iS the one most for your benefit. It must be better for you to have.a man thusunpledged-Thus ready to set in accordance with his known principles and his pastconduct than. to exact and to bind him down by any specific opinloss, or declared opinions, given on; any subject at the
moment of election (Heiar, hear.) Let me ny this one thingfurther. In 1807, now somo 50 years ago, a dissolation of Parliament too} place after a division oi a otioix by which it was intended to deprive our Roman Citholic fellow-subjects of that equalityof civil riglts which-they havo since obtained, and to which they were fairly entitled. That cry met with the assent of the countrt, au4 it was iiot till 1829 that the Ddke of WellEngton, amid the prospect of a civil war, removed those disabilhtis. and rastrictions by which nearly one-fourth part of the popula tion of the uuited kingdom had been oppressed. Going back still further, let me recaU to your ,ecollection that I h.o0uk'ears s0o there was a dissolution of Parliament
*ust at the commenoeme-,+ of the Amorlga war' and a
of that day afterwards sZu.4 rn tho it-use of Lords that the Government had hurried on tua diiatIon purposely that the question of that war might not be thoroughly sifted and examined before the elections took place. We know that a Parliament was zeturned which approved the war with Aujerica-which endea:voured, by force of arms, to subdue those 'who were then our brethren and our fellow-subects, and who are noiw the independent members of the United States. (Hear, bear. ) We know, with respect to the first question, that the hasty decision upon a dissolution, tended to aggravat the feelings and provoke the alienation of our Irish felloU-- subjects. We know that the cry raised at the dissolution of the previous date produced, and has perpetuated oven to this day, I will not say a rankling enmity, but a ranling distrust aLmong the people of tho Wnited States towards the people and the Parliamaut of GreatBritsin, (H:ear.) If audl are the painful results of an election conducted in the midst of a cry raised without sufficiently weighing the conse. quences, I ask you, as I should ask the electors of the united kingdom, on this occasion carefully to scrutinize the merits of the men who aspire to represent you, it may be for six Years to come-to consider, not whether one candidate calls out for the present head of the Government and the reform causo and another for the present head of the Government ana the conservative cause (a laugh), but whether you can find men who by their past conduct and their present character are likely to promote the cause of progress. (Cheers and cries of "Oh, oh !") I say the cause of progress; and it is my firm conviction that not only iS progress healthy, but it is lik-evise conservative (hear, hear)-as much more conservative than im. movability as is the flow of a healthy current than the
tagnationofanuunwholesomemarsh. (Cheers.) I believe, therefore, that you ought to elect men who will promote progress, and promote it in such a way as not to overurn the various intricate and complicated relations of our wealthy and prosperous society. I have slw&as had theso objects 3i
view, and I believe have been called backward and slow because I am not for disturbing trade. I am not for dis. turbing the pursuits of men or unsettling their relations to each other, thereby introducing estrangements and hostility in place of confidence and harmony between different classes of the community. I rePeat, howover, that I am in favour of progress-progress well weighed, amelioration carefully considered, the increase of the popular franohise and of popular power, but accompanied at the same time with an increased diffusion of education. (Cheers.) I look to the spread of education as the best security for our institutions, as the best and ablest men in the United States look to the spread of education as the best security for their institutions. Education is the best security for the peace and order of society. (Hear, hear.) With these aentiments and these declarations I hope, gentlemen, to have your support. (Loud cheers and some dissent.) Dearly as
prize your approbation, dearly as I value the honour of being returned to Parliament for this great city, much as I shoulid rejoice in being able to take my seat as the exponent of your opinonssin the new Rouse of Commons, and little as Iam disposed to bow to the dictation of a clique (cheers)for nO such approbation, for no such honour, should I be content to forfeit the approval of my own consolence. (Renewed cheers.) I am sure that you, as Englishmen, vill tespect that appeaL If you cannot agree with mcif you think that Ma. unfit to receive your confidence, mithhold it. But if you do think me worthy to continue as your representative I trust that no insidious mancwavre will be asowed to deprive me of a seat in Parlisment as member for the city of London.
The conclusion of the noble lord's address was greeted with three cheers for himself and one for Reform.
Mr. WmrxwuResT, chairman of the Ballot Society,
havn 'obtained rmisio
hving red percnsonf to put a question to Lord J.
,enp' expresedhis confidence in the noblo lord, bat said that a number of gentlemen were placed in an awkward position. The four candidates nominated by the Registration Association were favourable to the adoption of the baUot. He was quite aware that the noble lord had been hitherto opposed to it; but his lordship had receutl been a resident in Sardinia, where the ballot worked well, and was the corner stone of the Government. He wished to, ask, whether, with regard to the ballot, the views of the noble Lord had undergone any change.
Lord J. RUSSELL.-The viess on tho ballot which I remember I stated in Guildhall, in answer to a question which was then put to me, were these-that I thought that i thepresent state of our representation, there being, astho late Mr. Haum frequently said, about one in six of the adult males of tho unfted kingdom who have a vote, it is not fit that the sixth man should exercise such a power unknown to his feUow-citizens. (Slight murmurs.) Whether that reason be good or bad I do not propose, for the sake of fetting votes at the election, to change mry opinion. (Cheers.) I have formed that opinion not with reference to what happens in Sardinia, but a good deal from wvhat hapgens in the Uniited States (hear, hear), and from what I
ave hoard with respect to France, where the ballot was introduced, and believing myself that the ballot will not have thebeneficialeffects which those wIso are its advocate, represent, I will not pledge miyself to vote for the ballot. (h eer, and cries of "O lien voting," and "Honest John."}
Mr. BIzNoHu moved,-
"Thatthismeetingbhavheard with satlgefctlon tbemanlydeter. minstion of Lord John nsgelil to appeal So the freo sueerage3 of tho independentelector,of tho cityof Landon. Thaa theyhold tbis course to be such as becomes a candidata for the repre3entatioa of teis important eonstltnencY; and looklng at Lord John -arsell's eminent past services in thecause ot Cvil and religious libartY, and in the fall confidence that he wil CotinuO to bo tho dVocate and Promoter or liberal meas"res, thoy Plodgo themselres to give him their utmiost
spport."
He condemned the decision of the Registration Association, as improner, unwise, and indiscreet, as seeming to say, " Commercial men only ought to reprcsent the city of l]ondon; we are commercial men, and wro must represent the city." He objected to the choice of the electors being limited to a class; he doubted whether commerdial men were always best qualified to take comprehensive views, and ho expressed a strong belief that it was no part of the character of the citizens of London to bo dictated to by & 'clique." He pointed to tho history of Lord John Russell's public life as the history of the liberties of England for nearly half a century, and to the noble lord himself as tho foremost man of the ago. They knew that Lord Palmerston was wise, bold, and courageous in aU matters connected withr foreign policy, but that he was tho great obstacle to all reform in home affairs. Whether the war in China was founded in right or in wrong it must be fought out nowr Lord J. Russell had told them he would sapport Lord Palmerston when he felt Lord Palmerston was right, but oppose him when he felt him to bo wrrong. He coneluded by calling on the electors to place Lord John at the head of tho poll, and to send him h Parliament again as the free and independent representative of the city of London.
Mr. G. YoonRs, in seconding the motion, endeavoured to impress upon the meeting that the return of Lord John Russell at the head of the poll depended greatly on their individual exertions.
The ClUIRAIaM procecded to put the question for and againstthe mnotion. At first there wcre about 20 hands
negtie bin pu asecond held up against it, but npon th egaicbigpt3SC
d d to halfa-dozen. The chairman then declared the resolution to be eaided neniinc con-
Lord J. RuSSE.L then proposed a cordial vote of thanks to the chairman for the excellent manner in which he had presided over the meeting.
Mr. JoHN CASSErLL seconded the motion, taking occasion to eulogize the services of Lord J. Russell in the causo of popular education.
The vote was carried by acclamation, and in acknowledging it,
The CHARIURNY, having observed that after the result of that day's proceedings he should return with satisEaction to his own constituents, wound up the business of the meeting by earnestly exhorting the fnends of the noble lord to use every exertion to secure his trinmphant clection.
The assemblage then dispersed.
News in Brief
DERBY OR PAL MSToN ?-The speech of the Earl of Derby closed with a profession of Conservative faith about as vague as could be. No admirer of his can extract from it an election cry calculated to be of tho smallest nse. It is lust the old story-that whatever is, is to be preserv^J axnd if absolutely necessary, mended. So that the electors at tne general elcotion now imminent will havo to decide simpy btwen pre onsrvaiveandprogressive Reform. Theply wlnetplace ]t°heissue ontvhea maerits of the Chines
dispute and the division of the louse of Commons, but neither wtil they forget tho eminent services of Lord. Palmerston and his Cabinet in conducting thoelrte Russiatn war to an honourable and satisfactory closo. Even with respect to the hostilities now unhappily proceeding ilL China, they lell prefer to leave them m the hands of tho present Government, believing that peace wll thus be quite as promptly restored as by any other Ministry, and That our future relationS with China will be based on q.tuite as goodi principles as a Derby-Disraelito Admiinistra. tion could Jay down. As to domestic politics, unless the -people of England have retrograded, they Will manifest tho same preference here also. Lord Palmerston himself is, indeed, the only member of the Cabinet not gledsed by his own declarations to political progression. His Lordship'
colleagues bave throughout their political course advocated Reform, aud -we do not doubt that when the opportunizy a.rrives they will seek to carry their TIews into efect. As little doubt is there that a statesman who knows the temper of his countrymen so well as Lord Palmerston does will aid in conferring upon them rights to which they fel, entitled. It apers om Lord Granville's reply to Lord Derby, or Monday, that the Cabinet had aclial y decided to support :Ir. Locke King's motion for a 10. county franchise, and that it was ultimately opposed on account of the form in which the Bill was presented, and not on account of the substance. T'his statement wiU relievo the Government from much of the disapprobation which the division on Mr Locke King's motion had brought npon it. On the other hand, Lord Derby boasted in thie House of Lords that his folowers had consistently opposed the extension of the county franchise, and voted against the motion of Mr. Locke King. It admits of no possiblo doubt that tho way to promote an extension of popular franchises and the cause of civil and religious liberty is b euan oteHueo Commons t tlhi emsting iletio en oliberal politics, who are neither the slaves of party nor the instruments of faction-mecn -who wil generously uaphold a Liberal Ad-

xhe* n3nell measureso0f the Government have beon generally aprorTdW aud h-veeven found supporters among the members of the 'Oppbiiton.
And now let me say a few words on the paticular question which US led to the expected dlisolution, The accusation brought against the GOvernnsnt i,vhie-that, by giving their eanction to thne. eoeedADng Of Sir JOhs,EowrLcV and Admiral ilemour at Canton, they have Involved ibi s"esntry InA 'War withl China", without any just ground of ,qearrel.
If that acunatIon were 2me, the Government would, indeed, have deserved the cez4ure of Parblament,
But it doeappear tome tnbequite clear that thevolenors oommitted
3by th reO in Oarigte athbIP Anrow, haulintg down the Br tish flag, and earrying off to prison several of her crew, without any
previous ratice to the ngIlsh CCnL was in direct violation of our existing treities; and that It was Quite impaeble for the British au'horitisstoletsuchanouae passwith impunity. Wekcowthat lheir prc eedinwre apdroved not only by the ougilah merchants at Caston but also by the ?.rnCh and the Americans. We may form sine estimate of the Chinese Cormamisoner from the proclamations which be issued offering a Teward of 30 dollars fot every Inglishman vhoesoult boe hilled, Upon the whole, I think that IOU Wen erin - Posed to saY that Lord Palmerston was right, when he deermined to uphold and support thos servanta of the Cr,own whio,at sogreata die-

At the sae tier,Iamfree to express mo Fatisfaction tha the Government, far from seeking a continuance 0 the "to of war which bras been forced sipon usa, are desirous of bringing it to a clos as

LOZVDOB, FBIDAY, MAARCH 20, 1857.
In the House of Lords last night,
The Earl of EA.DWICKZ inquired the reason why the squadron sent to the Bay of Naples had been withdrawn.
Lord CLAEiNDON replied that the French and English Governments had been induced to Withdraw their ships of war in consequence of an apprehension that their presence might lead to an insurrection in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.
Lord GBty deprecated the discussion of a question of such importance under existing circumstances. The papers laid on the table deserved the most serious consideration, and would, no doubt, be fully discussed at the opening of the new Parliament.
The Earl of HAIDwIcKz attempted to renew the discussion, but the matter dropped.
Several Bills were then read a third time and passed.
Lord ST. LEoNaiR's called the attention of the House to the TuBwm bequest to the nation, and complained of the way in which the testamentary dispositions of that great artist had been neglected or set aside. He also complained of the " dark holes" in Marlborough-house, in which a portion of the pictures constituting the bequest had been exhibited to the public.
The Marquis of LANSDOWNE, while fully admitting the value of the bequest made to the nation by Mr. TURNER, said, it was clear, though that great artist could draw everything else, he could not draw a wilL The resolt had been that the nation had been forced to submit to a compromise with the next of kin. With regard to the exhibition of the pictures at Marlborough-house, that was the only place of exhibition at the disposal of the Government, and rather than not exhibit them at all the Government bad resolved that they should be exhibited at Marlborough-house, though it certainly did not intend themto remain there.
The subject then dropped, and their lordships adjourned.
Half a century ago it was usual to allow young
Half a century ago it ras usual to allow young gentlemen at our English, Irish, and Scotch Universities to meet for the purpose of discussion -that is, to hold what were called at Dublin " Historical Societies." This indulgence to the ambition or loquacity of youth was everywhere clogged with one serious qualification. No allusion was ever to be made to the politics of " the day," and the day was a long one, for it included a century, or thereabouts. The young orators took up somebody who had been dead and gone a hundred years before, and debated with much warmth whether he was a good man or a bad man, whether he deserved to be hung, beheaded, or shot, or to live in high honour, and so forth. The result was comparatively unimportant, and if the reasoning was sophistical, or the statements unfair, the victims of that injustice were safe in their graves. Now, memory, especially in the decline of life, will sometimes play strange tricks, and we could fancy Lord JoHS RuSSELL is all this time under the illusions of a second pupillage. Had his speech to a good many hundred men at the London Tavern yesterday been delivered to a debating society at Edinburgh it could not have been more a recollection of the last century. Of course, his Lordship goes again through the dismal old list,-the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, the Reform of Parliament, &c., down to the equalization of the Duties on Sugar, and a eulogy on that article. This is always expected, and it comes at the beginning of one of Lord Joi&s speeches as naturally as the style and title of a Plenipotentiary in the introductory clause of a treaty. Trae, it was nearly all done a quarter of a century ago, and Lord JoHN RusSEr in those days was a wellbehaved young man, and did as he was bid. But, whatever Lord JoHN was in those days, or at Edinburgh, he has not developed one bit, and he talks about the present and urgent affairs of an empire just as he would about the good or ill deeds of somebody reposing under a heap- of marble in Westminster Abbey. We don't mean to say that he is therefore more impartis] and just; on the contrary, there is no being under the sun so capricious, so violent, and so iniquitous as a young debater. We mean that his Lordship utterly forgets that this is a great empire ; that we are dealing with the tremendous future, not the dead past ; that tho matter in hand is at the samo time urgent and distant; that the scene of the afairs under discussion is 12,000 miles off; and that, whatever people may think of what has been done, there is no choice about the way to go on. In a word Lord JOHN forgets, or affects to forget, that this is a practical matter; it is not one for an idle comparison of barren opinions. The real question is, what are we to do with tho Chinese ? This question Lord JoHn RUSSELL, Lord DERBY, and all the other " atoms" in this " promiscuous" concurrence, have industriously shirked. But, though they have avoided meeting it straight in the face, they have all, with one consent, answered it in one -way-namely, that we must go on as we have begun. The difference is this :-Lord PALSTO.Xs says, "The Chinese have treated us, and the " people under our protection, with insolence and "crmelty. They have outraged our flag, and "obstinately refused proper reparation, or security "for the future. So we have chastised them, "without, however, bringing them to remon as "yet. We propose to persevere till we have "done so." Iord JoaN RUss= and all on his side say, "VWe have treated the Chinese
"with insolence and cruelty. They have mude-a "little mistalce, but offered proper reparation and
securityfor the future. We have ravaged their city with fireandbloodahed, with noother resuit than adding to their just indignation and their noble resolution not to give in. We therefore "propose to persevere in our atrocious designs."
If it answered the purpose or the humour of any number of young gentlemen or young ladies, or old gentlemen or old ladies, to hold a sham trial on some great historical personage,-Sir WALTER RALEIeH, for example,-to place a dozen of them in that "jury-box" which.Lord JoHN, for the tenth time, solemnly entered yesterday afternoon, to pull an antiquated correspondence to pieces, and declaim for an hour with mock gravity on the significance of casual expressions, we should class the entertainment with those private theatricals now so much in vogue. If civility required us to be present we should wish the thing over, and not ask for its repetition. But a farce which would be quite reasonable if the subject were OLvup CRo3wEL or MoNx is ridiculous when it relates to a living servant of the CRoWN, and the actors are politicians overwhelmingly interested to find the prisoner guilty. The " thorough investigation!' in this case is a thorough hypocrisy. There is every circumstance of the grossest injustice about it. There is that which Lord JoEn in his own case calls the greateat injustice,-tbat the prisoner is not present, and wiil not see a word of the charge till two months after the verdict. Lord JomZ- in his own case makes it a very great hardship that an Association decided for excluding him in his absence without giving him the opportunity of immediate reply. His Lordship, however, heard of it that afternoon and has replied in a week, both decision aud reply coming, not only before the election, but even before the dissolution. Such a grievance is but momentary and infinitesimal compared with the gigantic injustice of convicting a painstaking functionary on the other aide of the globe on the evidence of papers discussed at leisure, though relating to affairs of the most terrible urgency; the judges and jury all 'political partisans; the decision involving the great prizes of political life; and all parties being agreed, whether the prisoner's conduct be criminal or not, to do the same themselves at the earliest opporttunity. In fact, the real question is not whether a crime has been committed, but who shall have the pleasure and the honour of doing it next.
As Lord Jorm RussELL repeats to the City of London his laboured attempt to prove the " thoroiigh"' character of his investigation, the utter absence of a common understanding, the fortuitous nature of the concurrence, the purity of the political jury-box, and his own innocence from interested motives, we will take the opportunity to revert to a passage in his address to the electors of the City of London, and we trust those electora Will take it into their serious consideration. In that address Lord Jonx RUSSELL says,-
" On looking carefully over the papers relating to this mibject, I found that in the miserable affair of the Arrow reprisals had been resorted to and reparation offered. The Chinese Commissioner had proposed an arrangement for the future, which was declared to be I rery propc2' in a letter of Consul Parkes on the 22d of October. But on the 24th, when all was on the eve of adjustment, Sir John Bowring wrote as follows to Sir Michael Seymour:'I cannot doubt that the Imperial Commissioner will now feel the absolute necessity of complying with the demands which have been made, and I have to add, that if your Excellency and the Consul should concur with me in opinion that the circumstances are auspicious for requiring the fulfilment of treaty obligations as regards the city of Canton, and for arranging an official meeting with the Imperial Commissioner within the city walls, I shall wingly come to Canton for that purpose,' &c. The consequence was a demand for an official meeting with the Imperial Commis. sioner within the city walls, and, that demand not having been complied with, fire was opened on the Commissioneres residence at 1 p.m. of the same day upon which the demand had been made."
On this single foundation, therefore, his Lordship builds the whole of his five-story argument that the " new demand" was grafted on a quarrel which might otherwise have been amicably settled, and so forth. Now, the only letter of Consul PARKES which bears npon this part of the subject, dated October the 22d, is one in reply to a letter of Comnmissioner YES, in which that worthy declares that " Hereafter, if any lawless characters conceal " themselves on board foreign lorchas, you, the "said Consul, shall, of course, be informed of the "aame by declaration (from the Imperial Commnis"sioner), in order that you may act (in conjune"tion with the Chinese authorities) in the manage"ment of such affairs."
IJpon this Consul PAR1KEs remarks, in the letter referred to by Lord Jon- RUSSELL, "I should "further state to yoar Excellency that British inter" ests alone are placed under my care or control, "and not those of other foreign nations. When"ever, therefore, lawless characters conceal them"selves on board a British vessel it wiU be ' veri
" 'proper' that reference should be made to me "in the manner stated by your Excelency, and "that I should co-operate with the local authori"ties in the measures necessary for their apprehen"sion ; but in the case of a vessel under any other "but a British flag I cannot be caUed upon to in"terfere. But it is not only on aU future occasions "that this course should be pursuwed, it must also "be adopted in the present instance." Consul PAuRuXs concludes this letter by repeating his demands for " an apology for what has occurred,
an assurance that it shall not be repeated, and "the strict fulfihnent of the provisions of the "treaty in the proceedings necessary to be taken "with the Arrow's crew ;" and he adds that, " if your Excellency Cannot assure me that " these demands will be conceded, it is in vain for " you to again address me on the subject."
Here, then, on the most important point of the case, at the very place of the evidence to which attention ought to be most closely directed, Lord Josn, the " thorough investigator," the impartial "juryman," commits an amount of garbling and suppression that an old Bailey barrister might possibly have practised on a dull jury to get off a prisoner, but the lowest of the class would have disdained to practise in order to obtain a conviction. His Lordship, in order to produce the false impression that on Consul PABEES'
own evidence the quarrel might have been adjusted, and Commissioner YEH had done all that was required of him, carefully suppresses that the Commissioner wilfully and obstinately refused to make reparation for what had been done; while, even as regards his promises for the future, though the Consul called them "proper" as far as they went, it was only for the purpose ef explaining to the Commissioner that they did not go far enough, and were, indeed, designedly and fraudulently shortcoming. What therefore the Consul did say in the letter referred to was, that the Commissioner had neither consented to give satisfaction nor made an adequate undertaking for the future; and this is the very passage which Lord JO1}N RuSSELL has cooked into an admission by Consul PARKES that the Commissioner had made every concession required. We will leave this little matter in the hands of suoh of Lord Jon- RUSS-ELL's supporters as ever look into evidence or respect truth; but for the most suitable epithet to apply to his Lordship's part in it we must refer them to the vocabulary employed on his side in the recent debates.
Mr. DISRAELI is determined that his address to
IBfr. DisRAzi is deternined that his address to the electors of Buckinghamshire shall not be lost among the vulgar herd of addresses that aro Uow
elbowing one another in every newspaper in the country. One address, at any rate, there shAll be which is quite different from every other, which shall bear the undoubted stamp of genius, an(f shall astonish us all. We never saw ar moro determined attempt to be striking, and it has com-. pletely succeeded. It is, indeed, a very astonish. ing address. We know that Xr. DisitAxar is favoured from time to time with oracular impulIes, sudden mysterious insights, and penetrating visions which are above the ken of common statesmanship. The mist which obstructs our mortal faculties and perceptions rolls away before his eyes, and reveals some great political truth, aome solution of a deep enigma, which nobody else has seen. He enjoys a kind of pol-. tical second sight, and keeps up the ancient succession of seers and prophets in these degenerate days. Four years ago he had a magnificent vision, and saw a great policy " looming in the future," by which our whole system, political and financial, was to be regenerated. We have not heard anything more of this vision, by the way, to this moment, and cannot but think either that these communications from the supernatural world nre illusory, or that the seer does not make as much of them as he ought to do; that he is ungrateful for his visitations, and forgets in a little time that he has had them, as the ostrich lays her eggs and leaves them. The taste for the miraculous, however, has not left him yet; he is still suibject to sudden impressions that he has intuitively hit upon some great truth, andfolved some great riddle and mystery. It is the temper of the old magician and alchemist, who always thought himself on the confines of srome extraordinary secret, and lived in an atmnosphere of trembling expectation. " Eu"reka, Eureka r says Mr. DisRsELt; "I have "found out why Lord PAL51EISToN has dissolved "Parliament. I have got the secret. The motive "is ' to waste a year.'"
The reasons, however, which he gives for this discovery are hardly less preposterous than ,the discevery itself. The old rule against giving reatons foryour conclusion applies almost in the present instance; for, absurd as the conclusion is, it is made much more absurd by the reasons given for it. If Mr. DISRAELI had fairly avowed inspiration, or if he had said that the wise woman had told him that was Lord PAI.uERsToxN's motive, or that Mr. H.AnRisoN, of Uleeds, had told him so, he would not have been assailable by ordinary logic; as it is, anybody who has the gift of reason can answer him. His argument is, that " since "the dissolution the Mlinister has declared that
his agents in China wivU be superseded, thus acknowledging the justness of the vote of the "House of Commons." This is the groundwork of the argument. The next step is-" It is clear, "therefore, that the plea for dissolution is a pre"text," and the next is the important discovery we have mentioned:-
"What then is the real object ? "To waste a year."
Now, in the first place, Lord PALMERSTON Was strongly urged by his opponents in the Elouse, and by those who had carried the resolution against hin, to take the very step which Mr. DIsRALI now throws in his teetlh. ir. COBDENn S own words are,-" I say, clearly, send out a compe"tent person by this very steamer, armed with "full authority to represent the Executive "Government at home; let him supersede al the " existing authorities in China." Did Mr. DISRAELfs friends in the House on that occasion think that in urging this step upon Lord PALMERSTON they were asking him to do anything inconsistent ? They asked him to do this knowing what was the plain fact,-that Lord PALMERSTON did not agree with the resolutions of the House. Then, they could not possibly have thought that thi3 disagreement was inconsistent with this step. You cannot ask a man to do what you tell him in the same breath it would be inconsistent in him to do. That would be simply telling him not to do the thing. These gentlemen, then, plainly professed to regard the two things as perfectly colisistent. If they did not really think so all the time, their profession was false. Lord PAtEmrasTON was, moreover, pressed throughout the debate with the authority of the existing Parliament, and the necessity of appointing a new Commissioner to China was expressly put upon that ground,-i. c. it was claimed as an act of compliance with a superior authority overriding the Minister's own opinion. When the act of compliance, then, has been done, to turn round upon it as an act of repentance, and to say that Lord PALmERSToN acknowledged the justice of the resolution of the House because he deferred to it when it was carried, is simply to make a very gross mistake in a very plain matter.
But look at the act itself, and see if it in the least bears out lIr. DISRAELI'S construction. Does Lord PALXMERSTON condemn Sir JoHn BoWRING because he sends out a Plenipotentiary in a great emergency to take up the reins of affairs at Hongkong for a time ? How do you know that Lord ELGIN will not confirm everything Sir JoHN BowpjNGo has done? WVhether Sir JOHNX BOWRING is condemned or not, or whether even the slightest fault is found in hiis administration, depends on the result of Lord ELax-'s mission, and that result
is still in fldU1O.
What can have induced, then, Mr. DISRAELI so expressly to falsify his own reception of Lord PAL,
mERsTox'S announcement of' the dissolution only a fortnight ago I Mr. DIsnAELI then said: - I "exa not surprised at the counsel which the noble "Lord and his colleagues have tendered to their "SoYzERUGN. 1 think that the course which they "have recommended will be, on the Xwhole, most advrandageous to tliepttbic interest." Now it seems the dissolution of Parliament is regarded as a simple piece of mischiefmaking on the part of Lord PALMERSTON, an act for which no good reason whatever can be given, but for which the real motive, whatever other " pretext" or " plea" may be alleged, is to " waste another year." Will ir. DISRAELI say that he commended the dissolution before the appointment of the new Chinese Commissioner, but that now that appointment has been
made ne condemns the dissolution, as gratuitous and uncaUed for, for the reasons which he gives, and which wo have just criticized ? If he does, he preserves his consistency at the expense of a very gross mistake in reasoning. But he wil find it very difficult to persuade the world that he can have made such a mistake. The reasoning which would harmonize the two statements is unintelligible; the inconsistency of the two statements themselves stares us in the face. He will find it very difficult to persuade the world that he thinks the difference between a Dissolution being a salutary, just, and lawful measure, and being an unprincipled, profligate, and unconstitutional one, all depends on whether or not a new Chinese Commissioner was appointed. But persons who are on the look out for striking electioneering cries cannot afford to think much of consistency, and to " wast4 " another year" was too tempting. It sounded so well, was so short, and so plain to the meanest capacity.
Here is Middlesex, the metropolitan county, going
Here isaaddlesexothe metropolitan colnty, going $--begging. The important constituency of Southwark is almost in the same mendicant condition. Mr. BiRNAL OsBOnuz and Mr. Arsrxy FEPus.n
may console tbemselves with the reflection that nobody can be found to fill the places which they hv,v%.
left vacant. This is a strange comment upon the professions and practice of the ultra-reforming
)arty. Their cry has ever been for large constituencies for electoral districts-and we know not -what. Their most highly-seasoned invectives ha-ve ever been directed against rotten boroughs-pvcc et Uoroughs-and other similar rags of the old ytem which was destroyed by the Reform Bill. 'We have not forgotten how, in former days, Mr. COBDEN used to draw a triumphant com1arison between the importance and numbers ,of the constituei,cies whose representatives 4were in favour of Free Trade and the importance and numbers of those constituencies whose representatives still maintained the desperate struggle against the fixed purpose of the 'country. We are not of those who believe that there exists in the country at the present
onoment any violent aspiration for a fresh measure of Parliamentary reform in any shape. The desire will arise, it will assume a definite form, it will gather strength month by month, and week by sveek, and in due course it will demand, and must receive, attention. At the present moment the ,cry is simply raised for electioneering purposes. It is just a counter in the hands of the political -&art9 players of the Clubs and Associations. W"hen the time comes, and the cry for Reform represents, not the desire of certain gentlemen to obtain seats in Parliament, but the well-considered purpose of -the nation, it must and will be satisfied. Statesnen upon peril of their station and authorityprofe0ed politicians at the risk of their seats, and -heir fiiost cherished hopes of jobbery, must make up their minds to swim with the stream. Not all the pure Whigs at BROOxs's, not the most Venetian 'conclaves at the Carlton; neither the Court, nor the Lords; neither genteel society, nor the 3hangers-on upon that mysterious association, will be able to stop the way. When men are in -earnest, there is no possibility of mistake as to their earnestness. That the country in general at -the present moment is not zealous upon the -subject of Reform in Parliament we are confident; and we point to this singular hiatus in -the list of candidates for seats in Parliament as good evidence that mere politicians are, in point of fact, as indifferent upon it as the public out of -doors. What ! a Reform movement abroad, -and Middlesex and Southwark each without a -candidate ? lVhat would become of us if all -constituencies were numerous, turbulent, and formidable, lilke Middlesex or like Southwark ? The representatives of the last half-dozen boroughs which had been spared by the reforming legislator -s specimens of an obsolete world-as a dodo or an ornithorhlyncus paradoxus is preserved in a museum-would meet together in sleepy session at Westminster, job into each other's hands, and fall into sonorous slumber, not irritated by opposBition, nor disturbed by indiscreet questions. The British Hlouse of Commons would be even as the :Sleepy Hollow of the American novelist, or that solemn session of quiet Dutchmen who ruled the State of New York by assembling in council -and smoking their pipes.
One most astonishing point in the present -widowhood of Mdiddlesex is, that a representative of the family of BYNG exists-of that family which owes position, influence, distinction to the favour of the Aliddlesex electors, and he enjoys inglorious repose in a rotten borough in place -of soliciting the suffrages of Mliddlesex. We take it as evidence of insincerity on the part of the Reform leaders, that not one of them has the heart or the nerve to run the gauntlet of a Middlesex election, but we blame 'them only as public men and upon public grounds. The duty of standing by the Middlesex electors is hereditary in the family of ByNG. From father to son the representatives of that family should feel that if they meddle with public affairs at all, -the claims of Middlesex upon their services are paramount. At the present moment we find upon the roll of the Peerage the name of JOHN BYNG, Earl of Strafford, and of his son, GEoRGE BYNGo, Viscount Enfield, who both sit and vote in the House of Lords; and all this greatness principally arises from the connexion of the BYN-G family with the electors of Mliddlesex. In the present Hlouse of Commons the Hon. GEORGE BYNG sits as member for Tavistock, and he is looked up to as the rising hope of the Whig party. When Lord JOHN-SSEL is torn away from us, in MIr. BYNO;, we are told, we shall find a leader -capable of perpetuating the traditions of the Whig party. Had this young gentleman-he is but some twenty-seven years of age-been a mute, inglorious RIICHARD CnoAM7ELL, we should have left him in peace to his turnips, his mangold (wurzel, and his conscience undefiled. The opposite is the case. He is the future charioteer-so we are told-of this country; he is the pilot who is to guide us through future storms. How is it, then, that he has not the nerve to woo honour on the Mliddlesex hustings ? The epicurean representation of a pocket borough in Devonshire can never quali'y a man to play a great part on the political stage. Lord JOHN RUSSELL-to do him but simple justice-never shrank from a hand-to-hand contest with an important constituency. Even now, in the decline of life, -and with the opinion of his constituents violently -excited against him, he is entering the arena -afresh, eager to win, and at least resolved to stand the brunt of battle. All this while his successor is dozing away life upon a West country rockingchair, and waiting, as it should seem, till that honour is thrust upon him which he will not move a finger to attain.
This is a strange commencement of that which -we are told is to be a great political career. The -constitution of Middlesex, howrever, is in itself an anomaly. It is of course a county, with agricultural interests, and organized upon an agricultural basis, and yet the urban inhabitants of Chelsea and the eircumjacent regions exercise an overwhelming influence upon the returns. What possible connexion cau there be between the interests of a shopkeeper in Sloane-street or a Belgravian in LowndesSquare and the man who makes hay and grows turnips in the neighbourhood of IIampton ? lVhenever any nieasure of Reform is introduced one of its first and leading provisions should be to place that vast urban population of Chelsea and the
neignnouring regions in the position of any other of the metropolitan boroughs. If the distinction between town and country is to be maintained for Parliamentary purposes the present fusion is as unfair to Middlesex aS it is to a large portion of london.

ELECTION INENBLLIGBNCE.
W33STIITNKvT' -
LaTs evening a public meeting of the electors of Westminster, convened by the Reforn Association, was held at the Adelaide Gallery, Strand, to take into consideration the future represntation of the cit of Westmins ter.
Mr. Alexandte Wright was cld to the chair, and among those present were General Sir De Laoy Evans and Sir Johy Pallerstheale (the t eers for e city), Major Lo r.fPrm,bcthout,an manyther vs infentil vReformers of
cTn ofhe C snfr avingc brieflyaintro,dued the business of the eetng alle onthereprsenaties to address the
General Sir DP L. BvANs, M.P., in the course of a few remarks observed that somethipg had been said about a crisis, he did not know what it was, for if the question had been put off till the end of the season the Ministers would have had a majority. There was a majority, however, that he did not want to see, and that was a Tory majority, , hut there was not much fear of that, for althouga there were many who cahed tbemselves Tory Pxncerstonians. still there were many of that other classlknown astLiberal Palmerstonians. With regard to reform, he tbhoght much wns wantign in the way o an extension of the suffrage (ear , and Parliamentary reform was also needed. The Due of Wellingtons, for whose mtoil tary charater he had the most profound respect, said when he (Sir Do Lacy Bvans) first went into Parliament that the constitution was perfect, and no doubt that led to the Reformi measure which was then carried; but that reform was not sufficient, and Lord John Russell, in 1854, had proposed another measure of reform, which, however, bad it been carried, would not have been sufficient. (An Elector.-He never can bring forward a messure thatwill suit the people.) In reference to the Russian war he must tell them that for the sake of civilization he Bad felt that a warwith Russiae had been necessay for 30 years. (Hear, hear, and a laugh.) There had been squabbles and so on in Canton and othier places, but they should look to internal reform. (Cheers.) It was 25 years ago since he was first asked to stand for the city of Westminster, and he trusted that duringthat time ohadrepresented themtoheeabestof his abilty; he had also worked to procure reforms that he lssd mientioned, and be hoped he lad given satisfaction. (Cbeers.) His lion, colleague had the advantage of youth,
bichhe had not,but him longexperience in the borough had enabled him to understand their wants. (Cheers.) lei then referred to several local matters in which he had taken a part, and proeded to justify the r lifferent votes he had given during the short se,sion now at a close. He said with regard to the Tory party in the House, that they were very mild-in fact, they were almost Liberals (laughter), but he thought when they threw down the standard of protection they had no stanadard at all in the Legislature, and his opinion was, from what they had done in the session, they were bidding for positions. There was nothing in the flrst motion brought forward by the leader of that party about the income-tax, as was shown by the majority the Government obtained. There was, however, another nmeasure which was more tangible. Be alluded to hr. Locke King's motion. (Cheers.) There was something so clear in the measure that it required no defence, for he contended that there was a great defn of intelligence in the country that was not at all represented in arliament, because none others but 40s. freehelders and 50?. rentals had the right of voting. That Bill was stopped by Lord Pal.
Therston, who said it was not a general measure, but Earl Granville had said it wa a pity the Bill should have been stopped. That was something, comingfrom the leader in the House of Lords. (Cheers.) Ho regretted that Lord Palmerston should so have acted; but the greatest man had his faults, and he tbought that, although Lord Palnerston was the most flexible Minister (laughter), yet he was, under all circumstancs, the best inan they could have at the head of the Government. (Cheers.) He would not trouble them further; but with regard to what had been said against him he was ready to defend everything he had done. (Loud cheers.)
An ELECTOR wished to ask the General his opinion of the Chinese wrar.
The Cning! said that the course to he pured was that both the members shoeld first address the meeting.
Sir J. V. SalELLY, ALp., then addressed the meeting, and, after a few general remarks condemnatory of hole ana corner meetings, raid he was not at all afraid of mneeting the electors, for he could defend every vote he had given. Soe aUf these votes had displeased some, while they had pleased others, but every vote had been given with the conscientious conviction that he was right. Be then efluded to his political opinions enunciated on his first standing, and said that since that he hoped he ha give
satisfaction, anid that they would not now turn round on him. He alwany msupported the vote by bauot andanextension of the suftrage as the basis of electoral reformi. He always opposed taxing food, and as he was returnedl he had the oportunity of giving thelast ik to Protection. ha voted against al votes from the public purse for any other than secular putrposes, and had therefore opposed the CAynooth grant. He thought the greatest economy should be practised with regard to the maintenancse of the army and navy. They should, however, always bear in mind the defencesof the country. (Cheers.) He should always support any measures that might be brought forward for the benefit of the country. With regard to his doing the work of the city during the late war he certainly hai worked hard, but it was that Westminster should not be nelected in Parliament, and that the country should not be deprived of the valuable services of his hon. and gallant colleague in the Crimea. (Loud cheers.) He hoped that his conduct had tiven satisfaction to the constituents. (Cheers.) Hlaving alluded to the manmerin which Lord J. Russell withdrew his Reform Bl,pthe hon. baronet defended the condctt
of Lord Palmerston not only for the manner in which he had carried toe country through the Rusrian war, but he thoughit Lord Palmerston was deserving of every praise for the inanner in which he had appointed the reoent bishope,
aelthoughthe sdid not suit thoe ladstonitez. In conclusion, he rse i pm.t actions would secure his re-election, (Cheers.)
Mr. STUART wanted to know if GenerAl Evans would allow 70,0001. to be voted on the marriage of the Princess Royal.
Genera1 Ev%,As said he should not lend a hand to anything of the sort. (Cheers)
In answer to Mr. JACKSON,
Sir J. V. SHELLEY said he voted with the Government on the Chinese question, because he felt convinced the hostilities were called eor and necessary.
Mr. DExTER wished to know General Evans's opinion on the Chinese question.
General EVANS said he had found he was perfectly right in the course ho had ad'apted in not interfering In the question, as it was a most difficult one. He agreed with most of thei members of the Government that they regretted the hostilities in China, but sanctioned them as they had taken place. Therefore he thought the Government were perfectly exonerated from any blame in the matter. Bet the Government should have done when they first heard the news what they had done in the last 10 days-sent out a proper Government authority and a naval and military expedition to protect the British residents in China.
O doubt, they were good Parliamentaryvmen, but they knewv nothing of military matters, and tardiness and neglect often brought disgrace on the country. (Cheers.)
membero walk o utd of tahSe Hfouse whenan impoltant question had to be decided.
General EvAxNs said he had acted in accordance with the wishes of some of his oldest friends in the city.
In answer to lr. JONEs,
Sir JoHN VILLrS SreL1xy said he should always sup-

Mr. PnouTrthen moved the following resolution
*- That this meeting having been convened for the purpose or taking Into eonuIdaratlon tbo futum repTesentatlon of weWtminters and having heard from Sir De Icy Emuan anad Sir John Villiers Shelley a statement of their eondust during the pzesent Parlinment, and a declaration of their unabated attacament to the cause or progreseli
refori, resolve that imnmedate steps ba taSen to secure their return to Parliament as the future repsetentativea for this ciry."
Mr. ROBInSON seconded the motion, after which
Major LyoN, in a long speech, suggested that the names should be put separately to the meeting.
Mr. BIG GS asked the meetiDg not to decide the question that night, as it was not one of Parliamentary reform-it was a question of Palmerston or no Palmerston ("No! no " and cheers), and at great length denounced the conduct of Governnent in relation to the Chinese hostilities.
After some further addresses the motion was put and carried amid loud cheers.
Thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.
FINSBURY.
Mr. Serjeant Parry addressed the electors of this borough last evening at Winchester-hall, Winchester-street, Pentonville, and a resolution pledging the meeting to secure his return was carried.
SOUTH WARK.
Last night Sir Charles Napier and Mr. Locke, the two candidates for this borough, met large numbers of the electors-the former at the Europa Tavern, Rotherhithe, and the latter at the Equestrian, Blackfriars-road, at both of which places a resolution to support the candidates was agreed to. It is said that Mr. Scovell will stand.
LAMBETH.
Mir. W. Roupell addressed a meeting of electors at the Walwvorth Literary Institution. He was warmly received, and after repeating his political opinions, and answering several questions, a ,esolution was passed that he was considered a fit and proper person to represent the borough in Parliament.
A meeting was also held at Hawkslcne-hall, -when Ir. W. A. Wilk;inson,, 3I.P., addressedthe electors, after which a stormy and personal discussion arose between the hon. memuber and Mr. J. P. Murrough, MI.P. for Bridport, and an amendment was proposed by Mr. Culverwvell, hut ultimately t.hed original resolution in favour of MAr. Wilkinson
ROCHESTER.
On Wednesday eve Mrg. P. Wykeham Martin and Mir. Serjeant Kinglake, the Liberal candidates for the represen. tation of thi city, addressd a large and infloentiaa meet. ing of the eleotors of the borough, the chair being occupied by Mx. J. Foordl, one of the city magistrates.
Mr. MAR-TIN said he could confidently appeal to the whole body of the electors whether he had broken any of the promi.es he had made to them when elected last year. He was in favour of a considerable extension of the franchise to those enlightened and eduoated clses who were now deprived of it simply because they did not happen to live in a lOf. or 5?. house. (Cheers.) Any measure for extending the suffrage in counties and boroughs should have his entire support, and he trusted that the treat Libera party which would be returned to Parlsnent after the present election would force that question on the House of Commons. (Cheers.) Hl was for an entire abolition of church-rates, because he did not think it was just to advance his own particular form of religion by taking money out of another person's pocket who was op posed to it. He was aLso strongly opposed to the principle that an. religiouls belief should disqualify a man from Iae latifi, for his country, or th3t it should be a bar to ilsi
en;qiacig any of the colleges or seats of learning. (elieers.),
The subjeet of national education was the dsrling achemeof his heart, and he long- d to see the day when a system' of education satisfactory to all pazties should be adoptedL. Ia asking for a renowal oF their confidence he oulid assure them that no exertions should bo spared by hBa to sve them to the best of his ability. (Cheers.)
Mr. Serjeant KNGLAKE said it was a mere " dodge" of the Opp tition party in the Houseof Commons to make this election turn on the question of the Chinese war. Night after night Mr. Disraeli sat watching Lord Palmerston, to see if he could trip him up, and at length the Chinese question gave him that opportunity. Thero wasthimblerigging to be met with at races, but there was also something like it in politics, and no man had shown himself a better political conjuror than MIr. Disraei. (Aughter and cheers.) The real question the electors were called upon to decide was-" Will you have a Liberal Government or one formedbyLordDerby5" and he thoughttherecouldheno mistake as to the answer given by the constituendes. (Cheers.) Mr. Serjesnt Kinglakethen announoed himaselfas being in favour of an extension of the suffrage, vote by ballot, and the abolition of church-rates. If he went to Parliament he went as the adherent of no mnister, unles5 that Mister was determined to adopt progressive measures of reform. In a few days they would be called upon to elect their representatives and if they returned him he would most conscientiously carry out the principles ho had expounded. (Cheers.)
A resolation was unanimously passed pledging the meeting to support Mr. ).rtin and Mr. Serjeant Kinglake.
SOUTH WILTS.
Yesterday afternoon the Right Ron. Sidney Herbert addressed a numerous body of the electors of Sonti Wilts at the Assembly Rooms, Salisbury, some explanation of his political conduct having in several quarters been demanded. The chair was ccupied by Mr. JT. H. Jacob, one of the county magistrates.
The right hon. gentleman spoke at some length, and in the course of his remarks said that, although Lord Palmerston was a most popular Minister and had rendered great service to the conntr", yet he condemned the cry of "' Palmerston for ever !" without any mention of measures No body of constituents had a right to bind members to say that white was black in support of any Ministry and this was his feeling with reference tothe Chinese question. He was not satisfied witb the conduct of ouragentsnChina,irrespective of the question of war, and ho did not think it was to the honour of England to sell our flag or the right of using it to a set of Chinese who had settled in Hongkong, and who were no more Englishmen than the Japanese or any other half-savage nation they might choose to mention. When we got into difficulties with China our agenta did not act w"ith that spirit of plain dealing which ought to cbaracterize all our transactions with foreign nations. When we expressed a strong opinion against Russia for attempting to evade her obligations with respect to Bolgrad, what must be said of our agent in China, who wrote to his subordinates that the vessel about which the dispute had arisen vas not a British vessel and not entitled to British protection, and to the Governor of Cauton that it was a British vessel and that it was entitled to British protection ? In his opinion it was thoroughly repugnant to all principltes of fair dealing, and a disgrace to our diplomacy. The Government ought to have sent out somebody to supersede Sir John Bowring the moment the diffliculty arose, and he believed the Chinese question would not then have been heard of in the House of Commons. With reference to the late war with Russia, it had been asked why Odessa was spared, and it had been said it was because he had property there. It had also been said he had attempted to starve the army by witbholding supplies. In answer to the first point, he said he actually signed an order to attack Odessa, but it was not considered prudent by the Allies, because the 30.000 men by whom it was defended would have been transported to Sebastopol. The order to are the glace was ven by Lord ralmerston after heo r.erbert) nad left the Government. The charge of withholding supplies was disproved by the report of the Crimean Commissioners, who showed that supplies were abundant within a few mlles of the camp, but that owing to some mismanagement in the last few miles of transit the soldiers were deprived of them. He then referred to other matters, particularly to the support he had given to the embodiment of the mihtia, as thebest means of feeding the army, and concluded by expressing a hope that those present would support hin in the forthcoming contest.
A vote of confidence was proposed by MIr. HEyxmM, county magistrate i seconded by Mr. AiDnLvs, Surgeon, and carried by accfaioation.
lisses were then given for Lord lHenry Thynne, and the meeting, which was most unanimous throughout, sepa.-ted.
ABINGDON.-Mr. Burr, who was in the field on the Conservative interest, oppsed to Mr. J. T. Norris (Liberal), resiged yesterday (Wednesday). The latter gentleman has issued a handbUl in which he states he has the promises of the majority of the electors, and therefore is confident of the result of the coming election. There is no stir in this neighbourhood as to the representation of the county.
ASHEBnURTow.-A contest wiU take place for this borough, in opposition to 3Mr. G. Moffatt. The other candidate is Mr. John Harvey Astell, of 41, Eaton-place, London, and a gentleman connected with the East India Company. For some time there has been a division in the Liberal party, and they are now united with the Conservatives in bringing forward Mr. Astell.
B,UMSTA rLs,-Mir. G. Potts, in an address to the electors, says:
" Yiat(if elected) I sbaU en ter Parliament with one motive onlythe advancement of the beat interests of our native land ; secondlr. having a residence among yon, I must ever feel, as X always have felt a warm interest in the prosperity of the borough; thirdly, I consider t my duty tosupport Lord Palmeraton tn his efforts to sustin the onour cf the Briti3h flag In China; and fourthly, I hall endeavour to maintain, to -he best of my ability, the Proteatant institutions of our country."
BATH.-A meeting was held yesterday afternoon in the Gui3dhaU for the purpose of hearing an e Wpoeiton of the political principles of Mr. Arthur Edwin Wy of Ashtoncourt, who offers himself as a Liberal Conservative candidate for the representation of this city. In the course of a speech of rather more than an hour's duration, the hon. gentleman stated that he was in favoar of judicious and weU considered reforms, opposed to the schemes of the Sunday league, and to get rid of the laynooth controversy he would capitalize the 27,000g. now given to that institution. 'He gave the Premier his warm praise for the manner in which he had brought the Russian war to a termination, and justiIing his Lordship's conduct in reference to the Persian and Cbinese affairs. Jn conclusion he stated that, encouraged by the support he had received, he would tale the sense of the town as to whether he should be one of their members and would poll the last man in Bath. After cheers for Mr. Way and counter cheers for Mr. Tite, the meeting separated.
BBADFORtD.-Major-General Perronet Thompson d- drested a large assembly of the electors at the Circus on Wednesday night. The veteran reformer alluded to his diligent attendanco at every division when he formerly had a seat in the House of Commons, and expressed himself in favour of the ballot and for the freedom of all religious sects. In answer to questions, the gallant General said his friends the Chartists had damaged their cause by the way they had brought it forward; still he would assist to carry as much of the Charter as he possibly could, and would support an annual motion includmig one of its points. With regard to the education question, as far as he understood it. there was a great dispute between two estimable classes of men-tbe one class who wisbed education to be carried out by Government interference, the other in favour of educatirn without Government interference, but supplied by the voluntary primciple. Why could we not try to do both together ? Let the Government lay down a scheme for those who chose to join in it, and those who did not like to do so could support the voluntary principle. He was a man for peace when it could be maintained with honour. Ifa war were necessary, let us face it like men; if unnecessary, let us put it down like men. There ought to be something done towards advancing non-commisioned officers to commissions in place of the aristocrauy. as in France. e ecould not sup port the disendowment of the Protestant Church in Irelana considering that it would be beginning at the wrong end; he would go upwards, not downwards, and let the Catholies and Dissenters have more of the public money. The meeting unanimooisly expressed its confidence m the reneral political opinions of General Thomp;on, and pledgea itself to use every effort to secure his return to Parliament. Mr. W. B. Forster, who proposed the resolution, observed that the meeting agreed with General Thompson's views in the main, and stated his impression that the gallant General wil have "lwalk-over" at the coming election. The prevalent feeling at presentisthat r. Wickbsam and General Thompson wil have an unopposed return.
BrcxCsoeOCx-Colonel Lloyd Vaughan Watkins, a very advanced Ibheral member, again comes forwardL In his address he says:-
"The actfous aud, -am bound to say, incondstent oaitUon that as thus rematurely caumedthe dissolutiosn willhave the effect of eating the general sentiments of the coumtry, with lttle doubt In the mIndsof impartSal judgea Ma to the political conduct of the present

He expresses' his belief that the subject of church-rate will be settled in the next sesdon, and promises to adhere to the policy he has followed since 1832, when he was flirt elected.
BstECOySutxI- Sir Joseph Bailey has issued his addreEs in the Conservative interest, in which he says:-
" If you are pleased to re-elct me, into whatever h ndatho govern ment of thi great ooustry may be intruated, the safety and honour of tho people and the advancementof your especil and local interests sball ever have my beet attention."
Sir Joseph is not likely to be opposed.
BUCKWGI(AIMSH1RE-Mr. Disraeli has issued the followng address to his constitients -
"TO TPX zLxcross OF TBIM COUNT OF BUO GoHAX.
" Gentlemen,-The House of Commons having, by a solemn vote' ln hich the leading men of all parties ooncurred, censured the cruel and double-dealing policy pursued by the agents of the Government to. waifs the Chinese, Parliament hba been dissolved.

"If 3ou wiU accept the servioe of a soldier who loves his country and glorfes in her Conservative institutions and Ptotesant liberties, I shal he proud to receive the suppoTt which has been so coraialy promised nme.
CORINTWALL (WEST.)-A requisition cgling unon Mr. R. Davey to allow himself to be put in nomnation, on the Liberal interest, for the seat about to be vacated by the retirement of Sir C. Lemon, is being very numerously and respectably signed, and no doubt 3a entertained of the triumphant return of two Liberas for this division of the county. Great excitement bas been produced by the vote on Ir. Cobden's motion.
COVENTRY-Mr. Mellon, Q0.C, is canvassing the electors, and on Saturday evening addresed a large meeting. He declared himself in favour of retrenchment, but opposed to a " penny wise and pound foolish economy" and would support the Government of Lord Palmerston.
DAsTOUT.-Mr. James Caird addressed a great public meeting at Dartmouth on Tuesday night as a candidate, and on a show of hands had a large majority in his favour. He is supported by the Conservative party and all the lead. ingLiberals. Intheaddress which hehasissuedMr. Cird says:-
" My DoliUtical opinionS se tho3e of a steady Liberal who has experience enough to know that great questions of progress In this couutry cu only be carried after Public oDplion hag been formed by InTestlAtion and disnsason, but that when pubic opinion has been once matured the settlement of Any imPortant question cannot long be resisted, Free trade was cTrriedin this manner, and though there i. mo longer any quDstion about ihs reversal. it Is well to keep before our selves the fact that aplestifal sapply of food haa leswned crime, diminished poverty, and mitigated disease whUe it bs extended th trade and commerce of the 0oantry and increased the comfo.ts and happineas ot tha people. I am an advocate for a wise retrenchment of the public erpenditure, by the employment of the ablest and most efocent public servants and the dIcouragemeut of those who, havinz nO capacity for public business, owe their position to other circumatanes than fitness and abUity. I should feel it my duty to give a general support to Lord Palmeraton's
Admainistration. The manner In whicb he conducted lbo war wlth Russia to a satisfactory oonclusion, and, single-handed, insisted on the entice fuoliment of the conditions of peaceha, won for him the respect andgratitudeofthecountry. It however remainstob eacenwhether in his home politics and peace his Administration wi be equally sue. crefuLe Economsyand reform wi then be the testing point of hi. policy; and he wilt ever find in me a steady supporter Of wel]-consddered measwres having these principles In vlew. Bat whoever may he the umiister, there are many msumres of socilprogrom andimprovement to which Parlisment must early apply itself, and which the great resource of the country, at home and abroad, ontitle us todemand. The condition of the labourer is one which admits of much am-eoration, and I reckon it one of the first duties ot a country like thistomake ample proTision for faciltating enalgratlonfromShetowns and districts in which labour Is redundant to these towns and rich unoocupied lands In our colonies where the labourer and hhi family would be welcomed and their condition improved and elevated.'
DUDLEY.-All doubt as to the intention of Sir S. Northcote are now removed by the issue of a retiring address to the electors of Dudley, dated " Pynes, Exeter,' in which he states that he has been induced to offer himself as a candidate for the Northern division of his own county (Devon). 'This, he says, will lead to tho termination of his connexion with Dudley. Mr. Sandars, who has been talked about as his successor, has not yet deClared himself, although it is said his address is in the pross. e is understood to be put forward by the powerfal influence of Lord Ward.
ESSEX (Sou2).-A candidatebhas at length been found to oppose the present members, r. Bramston and Sir W. B. Smyth. The Hon. Mr. Ashley, son of Lord Shaftesbury, has con6ented to stand in the Liberal interest, and preparations are making for the contest. The struggle is expected to be between hint and Mr. Bramston.
FL,sBuny.-A requisition is being signed by the electors of Finsbury requesting Sir Samuel Morton Peto to stand for the borough. It is the general belief that if he comes forward he is sure to be returned, for the Dissenting interest is strong in Finsbury.
GLocxsTsR. CrTY.-The contest here promises to be sharp. A meeting is caUed for to-night (Friday) to advocate the introduction of the ballot.
HAuiAyX.-Sir Cbarles Wood and Mr. Frank Crosaley wMil address the electors on Tuesday evening next. Major Edwards continues his canvass.
H.ABtwicm-Mr. Jervis has started in the Conserrative interest for this borough. He says in his address:-
I'Deeply lamenting the mannne in which the Chinee wwar has been commenced, more especially at a time whenpescewas omuch wanted In order to enable the Government to reduce the estimates and tighten the burden of taxation, I am obliged, with my knewledge of Oriental manners, to urge that under the present circumstances It is abolutely necesary that it should be prosecuted with algour.'
HuDDEiSVIELD.-The contest for this borough promises to be a very severe one. The candidates are Mr. Edward Alcroyd, of Denton-park, near Otley, one of the largest worsted manufacturers in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and clr. Richard Cobden. The constituency of Huddersfield, which at present is represented by Lord Goderich (who is a candidate for the representation of the West Riding), is comnosed almost entirely of persons professing Liberalpinsples but theyare divided into two sections, in one of vhich almost all the Churchmen rank themselves, and in the other are the great bulk of Dissenters. Mr. Cobden was to address the electors in the theatre yesterday (Thursday) evening. In the meantime he has issued a printed address, in which he says,-
" Calle d upon by an inflneniial body of electors to alow myself to bheputtinonomination a acandidate for the hononr of representing yoerborough in Parliament, I beg mogt respectully to amnounce my Intention of takiog the earleetsopportunity of prewnUng myself for acceptance at apublic meeting of the electors and inhabitanta of Hldderefleld.

There is not likely to beany opposition.

The division has been represented bypCoservatives since 1841. Placards announcing the change In the position of affairs were published this evening ; andl at a meeting of the Liberal party Mr. Tillett, the chairman, announced that, after an ineffectual attempt at a compromise,' the Conservative candidates had surrndered at discretion.

I wagin respotelluy requesat you to retumn me to rarliament. Two yeas only have elapsed sinoe I taught your suifragea upon my acceptance ofOffiee. I took: that step, whi-h recived Your approbation at a period of extr-eme embarrasxnent, when, in the midst ot the greatest war in,which we h%re been sugared since 1815, Lord Palmerston, deserted hy his former associates upon the shallowest pretences, resolved manui lly to mneet all diflnculties aLnd carry on the coanilit in which thrse very ais oclatos had Involved us to a succeaful isuec and an honouraslol peuac. This nohle reault, in defiance of cmven counsels and tn the teeth of a fActious Opposition euch as lwa
offered to the Turkish loan, be baa aceomplisbed to the ealiofaction of the nation. No sooner has this end been acheveod than the earliet occasion is seired tD defeat his Administration by oue of these combinatioDs ot adrvese politicians which Saxon sincerity always ahboer and upon which he has now h oldly invited the expression of Your Opinion. The ouportunity for this 91ttck was one in which. with a gallantry whic h has trengtbcned every one who has terred the Crown by his recommendation, the present rrime Minister abuided by the acts of a dIstant envoy in a position of extreme delicacy. The quarrel int., which we were plunted bad become unavoidable. No recall of the mIssion, no withdrawal of our fleet, no ordera from home could have effected any reult but-tbedisgr.ce of the Britishfiag and thelmurderrofIlritish merchants. The emetrgency that hasnowarisen call for a plenipotentiary frully po--sened of the view" of the Gos-mmen&, who w iImmediately proceed to China. No oen can entkrtain a more entire abbocreuoe of unnecessary war than mny. elf, hut I am Oasmassred asanazy ruin can, be, that not one of the men who has beld high office and votod agiitut us would have acted otherwise had he been In power. The faied of battle, however, matters Utlttis a compared with the battle Itself. The People have to consider whether they willreaommesrd Her Majesty stil to be guided by the counmsels of one who has so amiply fuLlfilled their desires during the late maomentous war when that war was wreste by the poople from the hands of one coalition, or to confide It to anotisor juectlon of elementt still more discordauitthan the discaded omes. Pr myself, I believe that the same energy which met the aal on foreign troables will lalo effect large reforms In ons laws and steady improvement in oar Inetitutions, and for my humble shar
I cian assre you that, having pasted the whole or my ParlIamentary life in your service, never having sought or seeking any other, I still feel as fresh a wish as ever to advance before the age ins the developemnowt of the resources of thts great coDuntry, audito complete reliance on the good sense and character of its happy inhabitntL."

STA3iyonfi.-Lord IL. Cecil and Sir P. Thesiger have both issued addresse to the electors,.Lord & .Cecil says:
"1The grounds on which r voted in the majority apainst the Governmneutmay bo very briefly stated. The alleged insult on the part of the Chinese appears from the papers to have been no inult, but an act of auithority legally ustiiabloe ; and even if it had been an insult, the atonement exacted had been ample and abiondant before the merciless destruct'ion of the city of Canto n began. This was the view takes by a majes.ty of the House of Commnons, including every single man of any sort of distinctIon, with the eneeption of thes, who hold office. This remarkable agreement is of itrelf so strong an evidence of the justic of the vote that an attempt has been mude by the Government to decmp It as a *soialition for factions purpDose. But It Is simply ridiculous to suppose thai men so opposed iatalms and feelings3 as Mrr. Layardl and Mr. Gladstone, Sir Francis Baring sod Lord Stanley, M[r. Roebuck and Mfr.

Thoms and Sir John Ogilvie of Baldovfni both on Liberal principles. Mr. Thonms has since retired in favour of Sir John, considering that one point of difference between them (aMr. Thoms being opposed
to the Maynooth grant) did not linstify him entering on ae contest. Sir John Ogilvie is therefore likely to bo retureed. though some Radical opposition was threatened.
FALIIRK BUnosrs.-The Canidates for these bprgls are Mr. George Baird Conservative), brother of the present

CORK CITY.-The local papers say that there is to be a contest at the approaching election, and that the coming mans of the Conservative body is Mlr.Iobeart Longtleld, Q C of the Mutnster circulit, who, it will be remembered, 'offer
himself some years ago, in conjunction with Mtr. Leader, for the representation of the county.
DONEGAL Cou,,rr.-One of the Derry papers states it to be the intention of Sir Edmnund Hayes to retire fromt the represenktation of the county of Donegal, and one or two' namnes are mentioned as likely to come forward to contest
the county on Liberal principles. On the other haud, Mlr. A. J. R. Stow art, of Ards, is spoken of as the Conservative candidste. Major Conolly will, in all probability, retain his seat, nor is it likely thxt he will have to encounter any opposition.
DUBane Crrv.-Messrs. Grogan and Vance have issuetl their addresses. They indicate no modification of the oxtreme views which have found so mnuch favour in the eyes of the Dublin Protestants. They refer with great gusto to their opposition to the Psaynooth endowment, to the national system of education, and to the other usual t-opies. A meet-
ig of the Liberal party was held yesterday at the CommerCiaL.bui1dingzs, to takeointo consideration the expedienicy of inducing some gentleman to offer himself as a candidate on. Liberal and commercia principles. The Procedings were nok open to the public generally, but it is uderstood that tha feeling apered to be that as Mr. John Reynolds wus first in the f0ie is claims for support could not be overlooked, and for a colleague the mainus of three leading mercantile mnen were put forward-n%mely, Alderman George Roe, Mr. Francis Codd, and Mr. Jamst Porry. Ultimately a commititee of nine was a p pointed to consider the subject and to, report to an adjourned meeting to be held onThursd;ay afternoon. Of the three persons named Mr. Codd would be by many degree the most eligible candidate; and, sithough a, Roman Catholic, by far the mnost lik-ely to wia general spport.

PARIS, MARoH 18, 6 P.M.
The question of a modification of the French Cabinet is, after a long interval, once more among the rumours of the day. To what extent these rumours are accurate I am not in a position to state, but I think I can mention the ca-use to which they owe their origin. A short time since M. Mocquard, the Chef du Cabinet of the Emperor, was attacked by a severe malady, which confined him for some time to his bed, and which at one time occasioned serious alarm to his friends. The offlce of Chef du Cabinet is of the most important kind, and of an entirely confidential nature. The person who holds a post so near the Emperor's person must be, of all others, not only politically but personally devoted to his master. In case of dismnisal, resignation, or any other casualty, it would be difficult to find a successor, at least one who combined all the qualities which, according to general belief, are found in the present occupant of the post. During M. Mocquard's illness it was represented to the Emperor that, in case of its terminating fataly (which I am happy to say is not the case, as that gentleman is completely re-established, andhas for some dayspastresumed his duties),it would be necessarytoincorporatethe Cabinet of theEmperor with the Department of State and the Imperial household, as the Cabinet ought, in point of fact, to be a branch of that department; that the Minister of State is the principal member of the Cabinet; that, as at present situate, he is so merely in theory and not in practice, and that serious inconvenience would result unless the incorporation took place. This view of the case is by some persons believed to be correct; and the person who is at the head of the Cabinet, according to them, ought to be under the immediate control of the Minister of State. The recovery of M. Mocquard rendered the. change which was contemplated unnecessary or mopportune, but it is thought that the reasons alleged for it were rather favourably received by the Emperor, who, it is said, communicated them to his Chef du Cabinet and Confidential Secretary. Whether the plan of incorporation which was so near taking place has been merely postponed, or abandoned! altogether, I cannot say, but I believe it affords the J only ground for the rumours of theMinisterial modifications alluded to. One of these rumours was,
that M. dePersigny would probably be recaled from i the London Embassy, and appointed to a high andI confidential place in the Cabinet.
A Cabinet Council -was held a day or two ago of rather an unusual kind. Besides the Ministers, there were present the Minister-at-War, Marshal Pelissier, Marshal Randon, Marshal Canrobert, one or two other military men, and the Prefect of the Seine. This unwonted assemblage of persons excited some curiosity. Had the extraordinary convocation com-
prised only military men we might suppose that' the long-talked of Kabyle expedition was the sabject of their deliberations; but it is not probable
that M. Haussmann, the Prefect, is competent tol give advice on military operations in Africa. ItI appears that the nmatter these personages were called on to discuss was the project of a new boulevprd from the Chateau d'Eau to the Faubourg St. Antoine; and, as most of the improvements which have been made in Paris are with a view to strategy as well as use or ornament, it is natural that the opinions of professional men should be sought on the best mode of carrying a line of communication into what was the very centre and stronghold of insurrec. tion. Hence the presence of the Prefect and the Generals.
The second division of the Polytechnic School is to be broken up, and the pupils are to be sent home to their friends. The motive for this energetic measure is not political. It is adopted in consoquence of an act of violence lately perpetrated by the young men on an adjutant of the school, and which has placed his life in danger.
The Neuchaitel question presents, for the tenth, or perhaps twentieth time, a fair prospect of being settled pacifically. The King of Prussia has grown much milder; it is to be hoped he wiRl continue so. M. de Hatzfeldt had a conference yesterday with the Minister for Foreign Aflairs, who likewise gave audience to Dr. Kern, but separately. I am informed that the object of these visits was to come to an understanding on some knotty points which required to be arranged previous to fixing the day for he next conference.
Several changes are likely to be made in the French Diplomatic Corps.
The journey of the Bishop of Nancy (the Emperor's principal chaplain) to Rome is said to relate to the long-forgotten coronation, on which the Emperor still sets his heart. It is said that the Bishop writes to say that he found His Holiness well disposed to pay a visit to Paris.
A letter from Rome, of the 12th inst., announces that the question of an amnesty, which excites great interest, has been adjourned to Easter. In the meantime some solitary cases of pardon are mentioned. It is the custom to hold a consistory during Lent, and expectations beat high in the breasts of some interested in the promotion to elevated places in the prelacy. The consistory is, in fact, fixed for the 23d of the present month, but there willibe no great movernent, as no Cardinal's bat is to be given. It will be what is called at Rome a con-
sistory of Bishops. The seven sees vacant in! France will be filled up. There will be the usual grand receptions, which will add considerably to the animation of Lent. The presence of
Fling Maximilian of Bavaria and of the ex-QueenI of Spain, Maria Christina, wil add to the splendour. Scarcely a day passes without a fete given in their honour. The King likes his sojourn, and purposes remaining some weeks longer. It is said that
Queen Christina is determined to fix her residence! permanently at Rome. It is added that she is in I treaty for the purchase of a palace. The visit to Rome of the Empress Dowager of Russia, who is expected en the 28th of this month, has created quite a sensation. The preparations made for Her Majesty's reception at the Rondinini Palace, on the Corso, by Count Kisseleff, are on a magnificent scale, but the palace is not sufficiently spacious to lodge her numerous suite. She travels with such a number of attendants that 400 horses have been retained for her service between Civita Vecchia and Rome. 40 carriages are retained at Rome for her use.

AUSTR1A.
(FROM OUt OeWN CORRESPONDi'rN-.)
VIENNA, sAIcc 16.
Austria is perfectly well aware that more than one of the great Powers would be delighted to see her quarrel with Sardinia, but she is wilful, and has resolved either to obtain more complete satisfaction from Count Cavour, or to recall Count Paar, her diplomatic agent, from Turin. Men in office deny that there is any difference of opinion in the Imperial Cabinet in respect to the policy to be pursued towards Sardinia, bat in well informed private circles it Is stated that Baron Bach Is much more inclined to " strong"' measures than the other official advisers of His Majesty. All the Ministers agree in thinking that things cannot be permitted to remain as they now are, but none of them, except,
perhaps, the Minister of the Interior, who nonv and then humours the whim of the hih military party, ever dreams of employing any forcible measures .gainst Sardinia. This mention of
Baron Bach's desire to remain on a good footing with the men of the sword recalls to my memory a eircumstanee which occurredhere ratroIe.than four 'iy-e-arsi -ho . w then as. angry with Turkey 'as 'ho uow. is with Srdinia, snd' a Cabmiet Councll was held, at which -were discussed the measures that ought to be taken against the Porte. The majority of the isters wee of opinion that it' would not be advisable to take any steps which would give umbrage to the other great Powers, but the Minister of the.Interlor rose and strongly advised enereetic measures. The Emperor, who presided at the Council, was so won pleased with the sentiments expressed by Barou Bach, that he exclaimed, " I could almost fancy that my *oor Feli (the late Minister, Prince Schwarzanberg) was speakring I The end of the matter was, that the late Count Leiningen was sent off without delay to Constantinople with the note of February 3,1853, which, if the English and French Ambassadors had been at aonstantinople, would probably have been as fatal to Austria as Prince Menschikoff's note of the 16th of March was to Russia.
The information not long since given that Austria had agreed to let Prussia take the lead in the H:ol8tein-L~auenburg question is fully confirmed. On the 7th M. von Bisinarok arrived at Frankfort from Berlin, and he has already given notice to the Bund that Prussia and Austria intend to propose to the Confederation to take more energetic measures against Denmark. The Prassians already begin to talk of the despatch of Excutions-Tlppme (troops of action) to Holstein, but the King of Denmark has placed hmnself under the wings of the eagles of Russia and France, and consequently King Frederick William IV. will talk much and do but little. Austria has proposed to the Zoliverein to annul the Treaty of Trade of the 19th February, 1853, before the term for whlch it was concluded expires, and to substitute for it a regular Customs Union, but Prussia has declined to accept the offer. In the Treaty of 1853 it was specified that the Customs Union between Austria and the Zollverein should be completed by the year 1856.
The Protestants and Jews in Hungary fully believe that Government intends to make some important concessions to them, but there is reason to fear they will be much disappointed. The Protestants will always be made to feel that the Catholie is the dominant religion, and the Jews will hardly be allowed to acquire landed property. By order of the Cardinal-Archbishop of FUenna, the school children of the large suburb of Leopoldstadt went through "sIpiritual exercise," under the direction of the Jesuits, from Monday, the 9th, until Saturday, the 14th. A fter the mental faculties of the children had been as much confused as was possible during a period of six days, the Suffragan Bishop of Vienna gave them his blessing, and Te Deura was sung. In the morning of the 14th the Jesuits administered the sacrament to 1,500 children in the abovementioned suburb.
Yesterday there was a solemn mass in the "M Minoriten" Church, at which the majority of the Italians residing in Vienna were present. Outside the churchwas an inscription expressingthe gratitude of the Lombardo-Venetians for the clemency of the Emperor. His Majesty was described as the most benevolent and magnanimous of monarchs.
PRUSSIA.
(snoM oUR ow conRoNnDMiT.)
BERLIN, ItAcs 17.
Yesterday information reached here by telegraph from Copenhagen to the effect that the final treaty for the redemption of the Sound Dues had been concluded, and Baron von MIanteuffel took occasion, in the course of the sitting of the House of Deputies the same morning, to communicate the circumstance to the member assembled. In the absence of precise and circumstantial information, I presume this intimation to refer to the conclusion of the treaty by Prussia with Denmark, inasmuch as I have already forwarded to you information I had received of the treaty having been signed by the representatives of England and France in the foregoing week. The Mnister President made his announcement in the following words:-
" Gentlemen,-It is an agreeable duty which I fulfil in in. forming the House that in the course of the night before last a treaty for the redemption of Wthe Sound Dues was con. cludod and signed at Copenhagen. ( Bravo !1 from al Fides of the House.) As soon as possible I shal lay be. fore the House the papers connected with this treaty, and I trust that the House will derive from them the conviction that His uajestys Government hs been at some pains to futherth interests of the country as far as it lay in its power."
The members assembled at the time signified their full sense of the advantage conferred on the country by the redemption of this oppressive impost by rising at once from their places.
A lthough the redemption of the SoundDues is very far from being of that vital importance to England that it is to Prussia, it is nevertheless great matter of congratulation to the commercial interests at home that this bar to the trade with the Baltic has at length been removed, not only by the redemption of the duty, but also by doing away with the necessity of vessel lying to in a naTrow channel, difficult of navigation, exposed to all the dangers of a crowded traffic and a strong current, and thereby very frequently losing a wind and incurring long delays. At the same time that the sea passage through the Sound and Belts has thus been relieved entirely from this impost the transit duties across the Cimbric Peninsula (Jutland, Schleswig, and Holstein) have been reduced to one-sixth of their former amount; so that almost no fiscal hindrance will be left in the way of our traffic to the Baltic choosing this short cut by railway and canal from the ports of the German Ocean to those of the Baltic. What our exporttrade toRussia was before the results of the prohibitive duties there were felt in a decline of all manufactured imports is nothing compared with what it may soon become if only half be verified of all that one reads in the Russian press. There you find confident assertions of an approaching publication of a tariff containing no illiberal rates of duties-of a general conviction that is gaining ground with the bulk of the people of their having been unnecessarily deprived by these prohibitory duties of a great number of comforts and luxuries other nations possess, as well as of materials essential for the development of their manufactures and commerce, and of the general expansiveness and elasticity of the commercial world there. Any improved commercial relations with Russia would lead to an unbounded extent of fturther advantages; for every step gained in Russia towards an increased traffic with England is a note of release from the Zollverein sounded in the ears of Prussia; Austria is already making rapid strides towards a more liberal commercial system, and running the Zollverein very hardlin the south; and whenever Russia adopts any commercial views short of her present suicidal prohibitions the Zollverein will reel to its base. The chief advantages of the Zollverein to its component States were in the early stages the saving thLereby effected in the collection of the Customs the watching of the frontier, and the prevention oir smuggling; to Prussia's lot there fell subsequently, in addition, a species of commercial preponderance ner'rly allied to a poltical one; but, as each subsequent accession of a state or statelet has been pur-
chasedi by a protection assured to that state's. peculiar productve interest, the best informed men in Prussia are beginning tosee that their trade and commerce are being made to pay very dearly for their political whistle. If a few external circumstances come to the aid of this conviction, and the agitation that is rising up here in favour of a release from the Zollverein should increase in intensity, it is far from improbable that this institution, the days of which are already numbered to a span of about nine years longer, may not even live so long.
The King and Queen are now at Charlottenburg. The Prince of Prussia left here on the 10th inst. for the Rhenish Provinces. He will reside for a few weeks at the Federal fortress of Mayence in his capacity of its Governor, and will return to Berlin to be present at the spring parades of the Guard previous to his departure for England with the Princess and his son, Prince Frederick Wilhelm, who will, on this occasion of his visiting England, be formally betrothed to the Princess Royal. Prince Carl of Prussia left here on Sunday evening for Rome, where he intends to spend a short time in the society of his sister, the Empress Dowager of Russia.
Baron von Humboldt is for the present quite recovered. A member of the House of Deputies was taken inwell while spealing from the tribune, and fainted; after being carriea out into the Ministern' apartment he rapidly lost all conscoumesm and expired. The sitting was in consequence broken off.

3N BANKRUPTCY.-=x PAiBTE SlIOND. 1T WV- <--
(Before te LoRDs JusTios Or A-PrIET
This case, which was opened on Tuesday afternoon, was continued and concludeL It is an appeal by the bxnkrapt, Air. Francis Louis Sunond, lately in partnexasjp as a general merchaut with Mr. Cuilets, who had had died since the bankruptcy, against the deocision of Mr. Commissioner Fane, refusuig him any certificate or protection, and in twimting that if arrested his Honour would not release him until he had beenl12 months in prison.
Mr. SELWN, who appeared with Mfr. Tolier In suppor' of the petitioner's case, said that the appeal was presented more particularly against the view which the learned Commissioner most erroneously took of the judgment of the Lords Justices in the case of Mark Boyd, but, of course, incidentally, against his judgment pronounced against mr. Snmond. y this he meant that M1r. Fane seemed to say that but for the case of mark Boyd he would not have pronounced so severe a judgment upon Mr. Simond. The Court would, no doubt, be prepared to hear that the fate of their Lordships' decision in Boyd's case was the same as befel their other decisions in certificate cases,-namely, to be thoroughly misunderstood-for it was not possible to believe that they ware intentionaly mdsrepresented, as
uquestionably they were totally misapprehende. The feelng in Baeinghall-street seemed to be that. pis3 whatever3entenceonbankruptstheCommiss onersmight, the Lords Justies would mitigate their severity, andaccordingly M1r. Fane had resorted to the whimsical expedient of paSsig the severest sentence in his ypower, leaving to the Court of Apceal the duty of ascertainng the amount of punishment really due. Before stating the facts of the case he, Mr. Selwyn, would read such part of the Commissioner's judgment as related to the case of Mr. Mark Boyd. After adverting to one of the cases against the bankrupt, that of Mr. ILzar, Mr. Fane said, "F or such frauds perpetrated on the very eve of bankruptcy, by persons in a hopelcss state of insolvency, I cannot award other than severe punishment. The question Is what that punishment ought to be, and on this point I have delayed giving my judgment for some time, in consequence of a late decision of the Lords Justices of Appeal in the matter of Mark Boyd, a bankrapt before me, in which I had given the bakrupt a first-clais certificate, and in. wich the Court above reversed my judgment, suspended the certificate for five years, refused protection from arrest for a short period, and directed that the certificate, when granted, sho d be of the lowest class. It is my duty, and that of every Commissioner of the Court of Bankuptoy, to conform to the views of the Court of Appeal in bankruptoy in reference to certificates and therefore when I found so marked a difference of View between myself and the Court of Appeal in that case I determined to. examine Boyd's case again, and see what its prinoioaI features were, and endeavour in future to model my IuCgments in the matter of certificates more in conformity to the viewsof the Court above. Ihave therefore re-examinel that case, and I find that its principal features were that Boyd had commenced business, in partnership with his brother, as a stock and share broker, ia 1824, and continued that business with credit and respectability for 30 yearsthat is, to the time of his bankruptcy in March, 1855; that under the banhauptcy only three ordinary debts had been proved against his estate, two in connexion with his business as a stockbroker, and one a private debt. Of the two business debts one was for 2,500h, proved by a Mr. Simpson, who, however, was amply covered by securities, through which he has since been fully paid, and the other was for 3551. only. The private debt was for Ul. lOs. od. only. The joint assets received by the official asignee have been 5581., and the receipts on the separate estate have exceeded 1,0001. Boyd therefore was forral1 practical purposes a solvent man, so far as concerned ordinary debts. Unfortunately, however, for him he had in 1841 committed the Imprudence of becoming a director and shareholder in a joint-stock bank, which failed in 1848, and came under the Winding-up Acts in 1850; and under those Acts a call was made on him in 1855 for 30,4501., which he could not meet, and hence his bankruptcy."'
Lord Justice KNirnT BBuci.-Are we to understand that that is the whole of the statement made by the learned Commissioner of Boyd's case?
Mr. SLTwYN.-That Is so; and no notice is taken of the grounds of the decision. It would ill become me, as one of nIr. Boyd's counsel, to make any remark here upon his case, buat it is one of the errors of the Commissioner to have remarked upon the judgment without adverting to the reasons, and so made a decision so harsh and unnecessarily severe against Mr. Simond.
Lord Justice KmGHT Biioox-Besides other reasons we gave for our judgment, we distinctly enumerated a gross and criminal breach of duty on the part of Mr. Boyd towards a cuistomer in appropriating to his own use money entrusted to him as a broker for the purpose of purchasing specific stock, and leaving the customer unprotected until the eve of the bankruptcy. There were other acts of delinquency to which we expressly adverted as the foundation of our judgment. The case of Mr. Boyd, and not the judgment, was, perhaps, alone before Mr. Fane. Our reasons could not have been before him.
Mr. SELwyN was not informed uipon that point. The learned Commisoner concluded his Judgment thus:-"It would ill become me to express any opinion from this seat as to whether the sentence in Mr. Boyd's case exceeded the requirements of justice or not; though, as an individual, I cannot help sympathizing with a person who ends a trading career of 31 years solvent as regards ordinary debts, and only borne down by a call under the Winding-up Acts of 30,4501 But of this I am sure, that if Mr. Boydwas rightly punished under the circumstances of his case by a suspension of his certificate for five years, it is impossible for any Commissioner, desirous of acting in conformity with the views of the proper court of appeal, to award a less punishment thau a total refusal of certificate to a bankrupt who, like the present, beginning with no capital at all, has in the short period of six years inflicted on his creditors a loss of more than 80,000W., and bas substantially stolen from one gentleman 4,0004, and from another 2,0001 onthevery eve of bankruptcy. I therefore refuse thisbankrupthiscertificate altogether. I also refuse him protection, and if any incensed creditor should send him to prison I shall not release him till he has undergone a year's imprisonment. If on this occasion I err on the side of severity I have the consolation of knowing that my decision is subject to appeal." To proceed with the present case he (Mr. Selwyn) had to state that Mr. Simond, though he had the disadvantage of commening his business with smaU capital, had then veor
valuable elements towards mercantile success-credit with a wealthy firm, connected with him by marriage - c3nnexion with firms of repute and industry on his own behal F. The learned Commissioner in his judgment singled oat the case of Mr. Lazar as the worst against the bankruDt, and as it was connected with the wealthy firm he had mentioned it would be useful to advert to it first. Messrs. Schmidt and Co., of Amsterdam, had been long accustomed to accept draughts drawa upon them by Mr. Simond, and, relying on this being continued, Mfr. Simond, on Tuesday, the 12th of February, 1856, sent an agent upon 'Change to purchase 2,0001. worth of bills on Paris for remaittance. After the purchase was made Mr. Simond wrote to his correspondentq, Wm&ssrsSchmidt and Co., atAmsterdam,to ask whether they would honour his draughts for that amount, and, to his surprise, without any intimation thatconfidence hadbeen withurawn, Schmidt and Co. sent a telegraphic message to say they would no longer continue their usual supply of money. The custom on 'Change in such matters was to give three days' grace, and therefore for the bills bought on Tuesday, the 12th, payment should be made on Friday, the 15th; but, as the usual means thus failed, Mr. Simond had no resource but to stop payment, which ha did on the 14tb. Such was the explanation given on oath by the bankrupt, and his affidavit was uncontradicted. This was the case the Commissioner considered the worst against him, and complained that when Mr. Lazar presented a check upon the London and Westainster Bank it was dishonoured becaue there were no assets. The produce, it is true, was lost to Mr. Lazar, but not one shilling went into the pocket of the baakrupt, his general creditors reaping the whole benefit. Were there fraud or dishonesty in this or any other transaction the bankrupt could have no ound of appeal, for this Court had always refused a certi ate in such a state of circumstances. The other grave transaction on which the Commissioner dilated was that of Mr. Rion, of Paris, who sold the bankrupt clover seed for 2,0001., and obtained also from him acceptances for a similar amount on cocoanut o-l, which never reached Mr. Rion, as the bankrupt had never paid. for it. The explanation upon oath was this:-The bankrui,t firm had bought cocoanut oil for ready moner,
ana h&T paid 1751. on account, and then offer to S r. Mion either to take the bargain off his hauds at the price, or to take it on commission for sale. Mr. Rion cho tholatter alternative, and the bankrupt drew on him for the money, and Mr. Rion gave his accePtanCe3, out of which the Commissioner said he (Mr. tion) had beencheated; but, as the transaction between the bankrupt and the owner was a ready money one, that was not so. [This part of the cmse was explained from a long correspondence in French, wh:ch was read to the Court from translation, and which correspondence did not conclude until the 8th of February, the bankruptcy taking place on the 14th of that month.] The oil was not sent on account of the steamer being full, and it remained in the hands of the vendor's broker at the time of the adjudication, the delay being occasioned by Mr. Rion not having come to a decision on what account he would take the consignment. The learned counsel said that the assignees did not oppose the bankrupt, and the offi.ial assignee spoke with marked favour of the correct manner in which the books and accounts had been kept. The Comnmissioner, however, did not notice either fact in his judgment. ln MUr. Boyd's case this Court considered that he had b.n guilty of a fraud in not apolying a customer's mona1 as airected, and there the bsnkrript had paid creditors in or 'er to defeat the claim of the of ficial manager of a joint-stock bankr. Htere there was nothing of the sort,-no udue preference, no fraudulent dealimg, no dishonesty. All th,at
bere was was imprudence in trading beyond capitaL There was no paying of exorbitant interest for money to put off the evil day; but the moment the bankrupt knew that one of his essential sources of money supply failed he determined to meet his creditors, and therefore petitioned for an adjudication against himself, founded upon a declartion of
insolvency. As, therefore, Mlr. Commissioner Fane had not acted upon his own opinion of the merits or demerits of ti e case be fore himn, but upon his own most erroneous estimate of the judgment of this Court in Mark Boyd's case, it wrs submitted to the Court that some material relaxation oF the sentence should be made.
Lord Justice K>IsroIw BsIFuo.-I have before me ary iudgmenliin Mlark Boyd's case. I cannot conceive what the learned Comissioner can have seen there on which to ground his observations.

Mr. WIGRAM and Mr. BAG.LZY, for the assignees, said thatthere being nothing which in their opinion amounted to fraud they did not oppose the appeDant, and stated that the official assignee had felt ittobehisdutyto certifytotheCommissioner that the bankrupt had given his unremitting attention since his bankruptcy in making out and expl ming very complicated accounts.
' BA.scoN- ancl Mr. DzGxx appearedfor thetwo principal opposing creditors, AL Lazar ana .Rion. With regard to the pretended excuse for stoppage in money supply from Messrs. Schmidt and Co., there was no foundation for it, for the letter from the bankrupt, to which a message was sent refusing ocompliance, was one in which the banrupt sked for X,001. worth of accoptances on the security of some tartaric aclid warrants. As to IL Rion's eaws, that was founded in fraud, and so the evidence showed; and it was plain that that gentleman, having given his acceptances, was rghtfully entitled to have the oil shipped to him, and the excuses mado were mere subterfuges, and would not mislead the Cdurt as they had not misled the learned Commissioner, whose judgment was entirely consistent with the facts of the case before him, and was not warped or disturbed by any misapprehension of the ease of Mr. Mark Boyd. The learned counsel continued his address until the Court called upon Mr. ToUer to pl.
Mr. De Gex was not heard.
'Mr. Clement Swanston, who appeared for another opposing creditor, was not called upon.
Mr. ToLura was heard shortly in reply.
Lord Justice KNIGH;T BBuCxE said that M. Rion in Januar7 accepted bills as eiemittances on account of dealings subsistng between himself and the bankrupt. From the time of these acceptances XL Rion was entitled to the oil either as a purchaser or as a consignee upon a commission to sell it. No apology-no excuse had been offered for not sending it, and those apologies or excuses which had been offered only made the matter worse. His Lordship feared much that both the bankrupt and his deceased partner had succeeded in deceiving their own minds as tothe effect of their dealings withtheircreditor. He also feared thatit was impossible not to say that M. Rion's acceptances had been obtained by fraud. Then as to IL Lazar's case, it was clear that when the bills were sold the seller had a right to conaider that the buyer represented himself as haing ready money to pay, although a delay by custom of three days was allowei. Payment, however, was not made, and the reasons given were such that no reasonable mind could be satisfied with. EI such a state of things it was impossible, without the consent of the opposing creditors, to touch or in y manner mitigate the judgment of the Comminioner. His Lordship, however, ventured to recommend, so far as any recommendatlon was proper, that the opposing creditors would consent to some protection.
Lord Justice TuxRr regretted that he could not consent to any more lenient sentence than that passed by the ComDiSSioner. He hoped, however, that the opposing creditors would consent to a mitigation, such as a wspension for five years, and to allow the bankrupt to have protection.
The appeal was then dismissed with costs; the aoposin
creditors to have their costs out of the estate, but tho assignees not to have any costs fromthat source. The order not to be drawn up for 14 days to allow the bankrupt time to discover whether Messrs. Rion and Lazar would consent to any less severeinfliction on him.

HITCHCOCK V. CAREW.
(Before Vice-ChaneeUor Sir W. P. WOOD.)
This case came before the Court on further consideration. The queston to be decided was whether the numerous encumbrancers on the estates of the defendant at Beddington, inSurrey,were to be paid out of the corpus or out or the life interest. There were no less than 29 encumbrancers Snortgaiees, and judgment creditors,who were represented by the fo6owing counsel :-Mr.WJUcock, Mr. Daniel, Mr. Chandless, Mr.W. AL James, Mr. Schomberg, Mr. Southgate, Mr. Amphlett, Mr. Renshaw, Mr. Martineau, Mr. Giffard, fr. J. H. Palmer, Mr. Tripp, Mr. Roche, Mr. Toulmin, Mr. R. W. Moore, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Bnrdon.
His HoNuxm decided that the judgment creditors, subsequently to the settlement made by Mr. Carew in 1850, were to look to the Efe interest and directed the prior encumbrancers to be paid out of the corpus of the estate ; this to be without prejudice to any question as to the validity of the settlement, which was impeached in a suit now pending before the MIaster of the Rolls.
DICKSOX' V. LLOYD.
This was a suit instituted for the purpose of obtaining the opinion of the Court as to the construction of an obscurely worded settlement executed in the year 1818, aU the parties to it baing now dead.
The VIag-CH"c&ELop. accordingly made a declaration of the construction to be put upon the language which had occasioned the difficulty, and, as it appeared that no portion of the several trust funds comprised in the settlement, some of which were limited to the husband's family and some to the wife's, could have been administered without the aid of the Court, his Honour directed the costs of all contending parties appearing in the discussion to be paid out of the whole funds pro ta& by analogy to the practice of the Court in sinlnar cases when called upon to construe a difficulty on the face of a will in administering a testator's estate.

IN RE VON DER IEVDI A-n VAv -
(BeforeAMr. Comm?uioner FONBLA^NQVZ.)
'The bankrupts were tobacconists. This was an adjourned certificate meeting.
Mr. B3agley appeared for Mr. Delapere, banker, Paris ; Mr. Doria appeared for the bankrupts; Mr. L&wrance represented the assignees.
Thomas Holland, examined, Naid-He now resided at No. 8, Albion-villas, Dalston. His connexion with the bankrupts commenced about two years ago. The naturA of the transaction was this:-he(Holland) had been connected with the house of Davies and Co. in the tobacco trade. They were pressing Messrs. Von der Heyde. He (Holland) advanced thera, (Von der Heydes) about 1,5001, Had no bDusiness with them previously. He was Messrs. Von der Heyde's tobacco broker. Von der Heyde's being his debtors, he asked them to accept accommodation and other biUls. At the time of their bankraiptcy he believed Von der Heyde's were liable apon acceptances to the extent of about 7,0031. There were draughts upon them by Walter Irving and Co. and Kingand Co. They came into his possession that he might get them accepted. He received them from Mr. Da Jonge. Had no reason to believe that those biUs had not been drawn in the ordinary course of trade; neither, he believed, had De Jonge. Had sinme heard they were fictitions, but did not know that they were so. Certainlynot. Bad not, of conrse, communicated to Messrs. Von der Heyde that they were fictitious. Believed the bills had not come from Irving and Co. or Kingand Co. First formed that belief during the present yesr. The bills, when accepted by Von der Heydes, were passed by him to De Jonge. vho was a merchant. The bills came into his hands from De Jonge for the mere purpose of his getting then accepted. De Jonge had a channel opened on the Continent for discounting bills bearing the names of respectable people in London. De Jongo knew that he (Holland) wanted relief, and he knew that if he (Holland) got Von der Heydes' acceptances he could assist him. EAd not ore-
iously told De Jonge to draw the biUls in the manner they were drawn, but he knew that Von der Heydes' were to be drawn upon. Did rnot arrange with De Jonge that he was to be the party to concoct the bils. It wvas not true, a's Messrs. Von der Heyde had stated, that he had told them that King and Co. and Irving and Co. were respectable houses of New York and Bordeaux. He obtained through De Jonge assistance by means of these acceptances. De Jonge was acting as his friend; and he should say that he (De Jonge) did not receive any part of the proceeds. AUl the arrangement was that he was to assist De Jonge if he needed assistance. He stated positively that De Jonge brought the bills to him precisely in the state they now were, with the exception of Von der Heydes' acceptance or endorsement not being then affixed. He handed the bills to De Jonge. De Jonge's name was not on the bills.
After some examination by Mr. LWARmCE, from which the witness expressed a hope that he might be let off as soon as he could, and H. Christian (also a bankrapt) havinir deposed that he was in the same position as Me7srs. Von dfor Heyde, and that Holland bad represented to him that Irving and Co., of Bordeanx, and Xing aud Co., of New York, were respectable parties,
His HoxouR gave judgment. He exonerated the bankrupts from any actual participation in the very gross frands that had been committed somewhere, but they had been guilty of gross negligence, to which might be attributed the success of the frauds. Such conduct could not in the slightest degree be justified, and the certificate must be of the third class. Having regard, however, to the long tine they had been bafore the Court, the favourable opinion of the assignees, and the good bookkeeping, there would not be any suspension. He mnst, however, farrher observethatthepersonal expenses of the bankrupts had not been justifiable.
I ~~~~(Rclerc Mr-. GouLisuxi.)
Rv RE R. K. LAYE.
The bankrapt was a bill broker of Argyll-street, Regentstreet.
This was the certificate meeting. Mr. Chidley appeared for the bankrapt; Mr. Futvoye for the assignees; and Mr. Wilkins for creditors.
His HoNoURF thonght that the charge of vexatiously defending actions had been sustained, and that, taking into consideration the whole facts of the case, tho certificate mnst be of the third class, after a suspension of two years from the date of the petition in May, 1i85. Protection wvould be granted for ten days, to allow an opportunity to appeal.
it follows, that the bankrupt will receive his certificate in Mlay next,until which time-except for the period of ten days-he vill be unprotected.

The rails were very rusty, and had been purchased of the contractors of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and were used for temporary purposes. The prisoners had been in the habit of selling old iron at blessrs. Crawshays, and, from the evidence of one of their cervants, it appeared that on a day on which 12 rails were stolen from the prosecutors' field they sold 12 rails at Messrs.

CROWVN CotriT.-(Befor hr. Jus'Ce CRo)sfN.l o
John Oldershaw Joseph, ills,. ae-;, J,0h Buils, ju-., Williana Wragg ary Wragg And Sarah Dourne12 were again put at o bar this mornlig, on the chrge ainqt 15em of conspiring to ttter a forcedq ll of thgel laIfr John.Tackson,aw atha djourned-trial resumed.
Mr. TEXPLE, QC., proceded to address tho jury for the defence. He raid, the eooerse ed on the P3rt of th' prosecution was an mnusualu one. The rgbt', ooutse'
pursue would have ben to lnstitute clvil iroceedings to test the alidity of the will, to have filed a bil in Chancery, or to have proceeded by ejectment ainst Hsi Radbournm
when In either oourse an issue would have been directed to try whother or no thls was a valid will- and if that course had been adopted Miss Radbourne ana every one 'of tie prisoners at tne bar would have been a competent witnees and able to tell his owu story, subject to crosB examinatiosi, There would have been opportunity of comparing thoir evidence with the evidence en the other side, an-d of explaining every uspicious clrcumstance, and of ascertaining whether those statements said to have been made were in polnt of fact made or whether the± were distorted for the purpose of establishing a charge against them. The two Sills would have been witnesses for or against imss Radhourne, and he should have had an ODportunity of cross-examining them to determind wohet er or no they were wrthi f asnoment's credit. But the course pursued in first of all bringing a charge of forgery agaitnst the defendants before the magistrates at Nottingham, which was dimnissed, and then of travellng out of the county where the offence was committea, aznd where all the witnesses lved, and casting their net hbi means of han indictmeaet for conspiacy over every person cable to give any evidence ant support of the will was a ourse calculated to excite the sympathies of the jury as well as thei suspicions, and wouod lead them to wateh'
nore closely than ever the evidence which would induci them to pronounce the defendants gnst'. If he had not deceived himself and had formed arh d n ec
for the prosecution had failed entirely. ot was not for inm to call witnesses to answev a came not established, thf the prosection had not maide out a case to their satisfaction teyond the psdsibiity f reasonable doubt, the defendants were entitled to the benefit of the doubts o*a their mind; and the prosectors might then adopt the1 coursewhich they ought to have adopted in the first instanfce, and a ray would have the opporunity of comparing the vitodece for and againvt the vAlidity of the will. This was an indictment for conspiracy, and not for' forgery. The case could not be supported unless they were, of opinion that the wiU was forged; for, if not forged where was the offence They bAd no evidence of a con. jpracy, except what they ad was the overt act of the con. spiracy, whichwas forgin of th owill Ift he prosecution had not satisfied them that the wlgl was a fho d will, theno he should submit to hi Lordh that the whole charge fel to the grounid.
His LoRDsHip said, there was no evidence on the first count of a conspiracy to forge a wil in this county, aud he should leave it to the jury whether the defendants conxspired to utter a forged will.
Mr. TEmPLE said, the sod ndand third counts cha
acospiracy to utter a forged will, the first thing tohet
f ush dwasdt,at there was a forged wil to utter. If the jury were not satisfied of thts the whole case fell to the ground.Unless the wl was forged, there could be no conspiracytoutter a forgedwiLl. ot only did hesay a th prosecutors had not sustained their charge, but he might almost go further, and e sa that the had shown that this doet
ment w aas gasten a w the evidence to prove this to be forgery? The ist witneBsswas Mr.James Sollary. The onl peculiarity that he could speak to was, that in making the dJ" the decased be-an the light stroke on the right side of the down stroke. But there was a document produced by the prosecutors themselves in the ecclesiastical court as heari the genuine signatutre of the deceased, which had not that peculiarity.
Mhr. PRrcE.-Wo did not exhibit this as deceased's signature. It was proved that Oldershaw sometimes signed rece' ts for him.
Te learned JUDGE observed that Mvr. Temple had a right to maoke this comment on the evidence.
Mr. Tced an'n-For what other purpose was this p
produced before the judge of the ecclesiasieal court? ur.
li'Q ateen, the nextwitness, shid that the words "John" and eJackson" were each generally witten by deceased. without taking off the pen, but if there was any break it was hetween the IIJ" and the "o" in "John." He pointea out a hill to which he said he saw the deceased sign the receipt. On looking at the receipt, it is signed "J.Jackson.lThenh owas recalled, andasked if lie referred to the head of the bill, where the deceased's Christian name in ful was written by him. But the witness persisted that it was the signature at the foot of the bill which he saw the deceased write. As to the not joinng of the letters,they were as nearlyjoined as an old man in his last ilneces was likely to join them, except between the "J" and the "do." Mr. Fletcher groundeds knowledge of the deceasel's handwriting onTthecliarityof witing".ohn" wth an "I" and not with a " J. The wil is so signed. But upon looking at the will he said, he though the signature seinething like the deceased's. Wiian Was said he had seen Mnr. Jackson write, hut not frequently. He said, thin is not exctly like the deceaseds writing; that the "J"s is not likeo it, but that he is not enaficiently acqrainted with the handwriting to he positive. er. Josep Coope, a solicitor, ktnew the deceased 40 years, and the last time he saw deceased write was in 1847. A man's handwriting may change a little in 10 years, and after he is enfeebled by illness. On putting into this witnesss hand one of the documents laid before the ecclesiastical court by the prosecutors as hearing thendeceased's signature, the vwitneU said ho was confident that was not the deceased's andwriting. Then came the witness Edward Jones, who knew doceased 30 or 40 years, and stid he krnw his handwriting, because he saw him sun one of the receipts. On putting tbe receipt into his hand he said he cannot be positive, but that there was a sianilarity inthe formationor the I"IJ " This very " tJ "has not the pecularity of formation relied on by the other witnesses as indicating the deceased's signature. John Daly, who appearef to be better able thanmost of the witnesses to speak to the handwriting, because he had many recep ts from deceased, on looking at the wil and being ad if it was deceased's, said cI think it is." Then.mdr. Netherclife, an expert in handwriting, wlas celed; he thinks that the signature to the wilu was not a shaking hand, but written rith hesitation, and not with a firm hand. It is sid that the signature of the deceased and those of the witnesses are written with different ink Deceased writing slower than the others may have marked heavier, and consequently left a darker colour. But if the te h be forged, as suggested, why should it not al be written with the same ink? Again, below the deceased's signature are the words,
ILeaving John Oldershaw, builder, trustee." Oldershaw in his evidence before the ecclesiastical court said. this was written by deceased after the attesting witnesses had left. But if the will is a forgery, why was nuts fresh wtil written with this a pointment of Oldershaw as trustee in the body of it? The next head of evidence was of statements nmade by the defendants, particularly by the Sail, admitting themselves to be guilty of perjour. Their evidence was of a terrific and ytr most questionable character againt Miss Radbour'ne. He could not on her behalf cross. neamine them asuwitnesses. He must ask them to disbelieve them ; to say that they are this day-but their confession is not upon oath-perjurers. He suggest that they had been botght over. Down to the present moment those two persons had been making statements that them would be transo posted and so forth, in order to induce Miss RadXourne to buy them off. Among the documents produced in the ecclesiastical court was one dated February 6, 1854-about the time when the defendants were before the magistrates at sottihanemn-being a promise by George Butler to give Elijah Barker and one Clarke 1,000f. each in case the property of the late mur. Jackson should he recovered. Wes it not manifest that bribery and corruption bad been usad in this case? These Sils had throughout been play ing at fast and loose, hut there was notiA tittle of evidence that ArmlRadsournehad attemptedrto bribe them. Was their cor.fession true or probable that they grattitously leni thmselves to this iniquitous scheme without a bribe I He said not. Bfit was a bribe from the other parties to induca them now to impugn the will altogether improbable Mfi s tdborrne, inustead of bribing them, kept them throughout at armi's len,th, She had them imprisoned in Nottingham gcutor compeluthem to come to the ecclesiastical court in
Yor t prvethewil,and dared them to say there what the plase Wis tat heconduct of a person who knew that sheracy hae uilrty of la forgery towmais two of her confederats,inwhsepoershe must havelImo-wnshe was? Then Jame M'Queesi said that in teclatter end ofI tyeaR he hada onvrstio wth the younger Sills, and commenced by telling him that they had been badly used by being put into prison, andl that if he (the witness) wasin their pstio
he wom-ld speak the truth. Was not this 9-ethoe, first approaches of the tempter? The whitness then narrates the yalleged confesston of Sie.s that they signed the will out of the presence of the testator, That was ro forgery ; it might be an insufficient attestation, but no offence at lawv. lluch evidence was given as to the Wraggs. Wragg, being brother-in-law of Miss nbaourme, might have been officious; and here he might observe that the prosecutors, imputing to the defendanits a dark and secret conspiracy to divert a large property from its natural heirs yet gave evidence of the mnost open declarations from time to time by the defendants oftheir intention. Was thatprobable? jtremiah Sbaw said that he told Wragg he would Attest Mir. Jackson's Iwil if they could get no one else. Did Mr.- na-suppse n was aske t- do anthnwog?-
"haw suPrnose e svas asked to do anything wrong? He could not call Wragg to explain vhat was said, becauase the prosecutors had closed his mouth by including him in this
indictment. Then as to Oldersbaw and Miss Radbourne,
where was the evidence which implicated them? What the Sls andthe Wraggs had saidwasevidence againstthemselves only. The next witness, Horrobib., said, " Oldersbaw asked ine if I would come forward if wanted, and say that on the
day of the date of the will I was at deceased's house, and aw him, Oldershaw, and the Sills busy wvriting." That was bcforo the examination before the nagistrate at Nottin.
bem, till when it was not known that any corroboration of the Sills would be required. That wsas an extrordinary statement, given by avwitness who admitted that he had been in prison for stealng apples and a jacket. Tho important 'witnese not beheved on a former occasion-I mean Ms. Bailker-speaks ofthe Wraggs only. Her evidenco was most
sius.icious becauseitw.asbought. Thedocumentbehadalluded to promised 1,000g. to that woman's husband it Mr. Jackson's
property was recovered from MiasRadbourne. What need had an honest vitness of a bribe to speak the truth? Sbe was not believed btfore. Did they think her more entitled
to belief now that this document had come to light? Another part of the case of the prosecutors was that the deceased expressed his intention never to make a will. That accounted for the circumstances under which that will vas made. A distant relation-Mr.
Eearson-used to come to the house. If that was a civil prcccediung Miss Radbourne could have told her own tale
now Ehe had been induced to enter the service of the de-
cer d, how the had conducted to his comfort, and how, in hi Siness, he resolved-to proride for her. -3lie declared that he would make no will in order to prevent himself from
eisg haassedbyhisrelatives. The wholse was before
themn; were they satisfied that the defendants were guilty of this COnSpiracy?t Did not tho evidence rather how that
the proseoutors were the cons prators to suppress al the evidence in suppost of this wiftl The learmed counsel concluded an eloquent speech by caUing upon the jury to acquit the ptisonere in order that they and their prosecutors might carry on those proceedings ia tho civil tribunal, where alono the validity of the will could be satisfactorily determined.
The Sills declined to address the jury, except that they were entirely in their hands.
Mr. Justice CRomPToiN anmmed up the case to the jury. His Lordsbip said, the first count chargingconspiracy to forge having taken place in Notts cannot be tried here. The charge to be considered, therefore, is that of conspiracy to titter and bring forward a forged wilL . Whether ail or any two of the defendants, except Wraggs and his wife (because a man and his wife cannot conspire together) bave conspired to utter a forged will is the question for your consideration. You must bo perfectly satisfied the iostrunent in question was forged. The prosecutors adduce evidence as to the handwriting, but more a to the statements and conduct of the defendants. You must not determine the guilt of any of the defendants upon the statements of tbe others. Is ib consistent with the conduct of the defendants that there was a genuine wil nmade in November, 1853 ? That in my mind is the strong part of the case. It seems established that the deceased was averse to making a will. It is for you to say if you can account for this aversion on the grounds suggested by Mr. Temple. You bave heard from Mr. Temple a violent attack upon the prosecutors. It seems to me that the proceedings in the civil tribunals should have terminated before a criminal prosecution was iustituted, and you ought for that reason to look with some Jealousy upon the prosecutors, but not to carry that jealousy too far. It is imputed that the Sils have been bribed, and a document exhibited in the ecclesiastical court is relied on insopport of this imputation. There is no explanation given of this document. You must also consider the openness of the defendant's statements as to whal is alleged to ba a secret conspiracy. Mliss Radhourne propounded the alleged will for probate in the ecclesiastical court, which is all that she appears to have done. It is sugge-ted that the Sills believed the signature of the deceased to be genuine when they out of his pre'ence signed their names as witnesses. You must consider if this is likely. Oldershaw says that the Sills signed at decease&s house. The appointment of Oldershaw as trustee being Pitten below the testator's signature is not very materiil. The evidence as to the handwriting is not very satisfactory, and you must therefore pay the more attention to the other evidence. [The learned judge then remuarked upon the discrepanoy between Oldershaw's deposition in the ecclesiastical court, narrating his writing out the wiUl at the deceased's request and its execution in November, 1853, and his subsequent statements that deceased had made no will. The learnedjudge then read and commented on the depositions of the Sils in the ecclesiastic^l court, and their reluctance to come forward to mnake them. With regard to the deceassd's handwriting, the witnesses' belief from the general appearance of the writing is more satisfactory bhan from the formation of any particular letters or words. [The learned Judge here read and commented on the evidence of the witnezses as to the handwriting.] If the case depended upon this head of evidence only I should not be satisfied that this was a forgery. The other evidence as affects each defendant separately nmst be considered. [Thelearned Judge here wentcarefully through and commented on the rest of the evidence as it affected each defendant.] You must consider the case of each defendant, and say if they, or any two of them, ex. cept the Wragga, have conspired to utter a forged wil.
Te jury retired at a quarter before 2 o'clock. Ab 20 minutes to 6 they returned with their verdict of Guilty against all the defendants except the two Sils, who were Acquitu*d.
The learned Junn(;E then addressing Oldershaw, the two Wraggs, and Sarah Radbourne, said that he folly concurred in the verdict, and only regretted that they were prosecuted on this indictment, a nd not for the felony. The prosecutors, continued his Lordship, by indicting you here for a misdemeanour have compromised the course of justice. I have had doubts during the trial whether I ought not to stop It, and send you to be tried for the forgery. I shall, however, pass upon you the severest sentence which the law allows, 'Which is that each of you be imprisoned and kept to hard labour for two years. His Lordship added that he should not now keep the two Sills in custody, but they were liable to be prosecuted for perjurv.
The property which would have passed by the will, if eenue, exceeds in value, it is said, 30,0001., and not
,0001. as stated in our yesterday's report.
CIVIL COtJRT.-(Before M.P. Baron MARTry and a Special
Jur,p.)
WHITEHEAD V. WORRALL.
Air. Knowles, Q.C., Mr. Atherton, QC., and Mr. Hindmarch appeared for the plaintiff; and Sir F. Thesiger (speciaUy retained), Mr. H. fiU, Q.C., and Mr. Webster for the defendant.
Mr. HIINDMARCH opened the pleadings, Fand Mr. KNoWIs stated the plaintiff's case.
This was an action for an infringement of a patent, granted to the plaintiff on the 15th of August, 1844, for im. provements in the process of finishing fustians and other similar fabries. These improvements eonsisted in dying the fabrics immediatelY on their coming from the loom, before raising the nap, whereby the fabric, when finished, had a much better appearance, and the colour was more uniform than if dyed after the raising of the nap, as previously practised. At the close of Mr. Knowles's statement, the learned judgesuggested that the parties had better consider whe. ther asettlement might not be come to as the patent had a very short time fone year) to last, and tbe result of a verdict on either side might be only to cause further litigation.
The counsel on both sides having consulted for a shorb time, it was arranged that a verdict should be entered for the plaintiff, and that the defendant should take a heense.
Hi LoBDsn1P granted a certilicate that the validity of the patent had come in question.
This case being expectod to occupy above a day, no other civil cause was ready, and his LorJship sent over for a case from the Crown Court.
MARCH 18.
(Before Mrr. Baron MAsTirN.)
Daniel Diekenson, aged 36, James Gledall, aged 35, and WiUiam Marsden were indicted for a burglary in the dwell. ing-house of WiUiam Bradley, of the Manor Oaks, near Sheffield, and stealing therefrom 301. in money, a large quantity of plate, two gold watches, and other property, on the 8th of December last. They were also indicted for receiving this property, knowing it to have been stolen.
This case commenced yesterday morning, and occupied the greater part of the day. From the extraordinary circumstances connected with it the Court was densely crowded to hear the triaL
Mr. Overend, Q.C., Mr. Monk, and Mr. Johnstone, prosecuted; Mr. Price defended the prisoner Dickenson; Mr. Seymour, Gledall; and Mr. Campbell Foster, the prisoner Marsden.
Mr. OVEREeSD, in opening the case, said, the proseeu. tor is a brewer in a large way of business residing at a place caUed the Manor Oaks, about a mile and a-half from Shef. field. The prisoner Dickenson lived at Rawmarsh, seven miles from Sheffield; Gledall livcd at Barnsley, 14 miles from Sheffield; and Marsden lived at a house near the Manor Oaks. On the 8th of December the proseeutor arrived at his house about 8 o'clock, from Sheffield, and took home with him a quantity of money-between 301. and 401., in gold and notes, the notes being 51. -notes of the Doncaster Bank. His wife, as he was counting the money, playfully asked him to give her one of these notes, as it was a shabby one, and this circumstance led them to remark tho note more particularly. Mrs. Bradley's mother was at that time living in the house and in very bad health, and, to be near her mother, Mrs. Bradley that night slept in an ad. joining room to hers, and notin her husband's room. About 2 o'clock in the morning Mrs. Bradley heard a loud crashing noise like the breaking of windows; she immediately got up and went to her husband's room, and endeavoured to awake him, calling to him, "William, William !1" aud shaking him. He was hardly out of his bed when five men, masked with black empe, burst open a door into the reom and rushed in. The two first men were the prisoners Dickenson and Gledall. The three other men earried lights, and one of them had a revolver in his band, which, however, belonged to Mr. Bradley, having been taken from a drawer downstairs, and was not loaded. The men cried out, " D-n him, murder him 1" and rushed upon him. Mrs. Bradley, who is a stout active woman, got between her husband and the men at the aide of the bed, and protected him by her entreaties and efforts as well as she could. One of the men, Dickenson, got round to the foot of the bed and endeavouredto reach over. Gledall struck severalsevere blows with a life-preserver at Mr. Bradley, who endeavoured to protect himself as well as he could. One blow struck Mrs. Bradley on the bosom, and she nearly fainted. While she was momentarily in this condition Mr. Bradley was struck a severe blovgn his hand, which he held up to protect himself, and wn h broke one of his fingers. Somne of the men then cried out, "Oh! spare her; she is a good sort."
and the men ceased beating them. They then began to break open the drawers in the room, and from one drawer took a quantity of silver coins. They then took a wateb, and Mrs. Bradley sXW as they took it that ib was half-past 2 o'clock. After this they left
the room and a loud exclamation was heard of "I Key lads, this is the shop I" and they proceeded to a room where the plate was kept, and broke open a number of boxes there. They then proceeded to the servants' room and broke open the boxes there. After telling lr. and Mrs. Bradley that they would murder them if they made a noise, and that they should stay two hours in the house, they went away. On an examination of the house it was discovered that tho burglars had effected an entrance by breaking open one of the breakfast-room windows; and it was discovered that the house had been ransacked and alargequantity of plate taken away, besides Mr. Bradley's gold watcb, and Mrs. Bradley's gold watch from her room, with a number of trinkets. On a
Sower-bed in the garden there was discovered a foot print of a jseculiar character, which was carefully covered with a slate to protect it from injury, and footsteps were traced some distance. At 3 o'clock seven men were met coming in the direction from the Manor Oaks by a man named Cheatham, carrying bundles, and going towards Eclesfield. At a-quarter to 6seven men were met at Eclesfield one of whom would be identified as Gledall. At 7 o'clock four men were seen at Hoyland-
_mmon, carting something bulky, one of whom was Vilkenson. Sevral witnesses met these men going towards
Barnaly, who wvould speak to both Dickenson and Gledall. Oa thel6th of December flickenson and Gledall wecre taken into custody. On the 11th they were drinking w/ith others at a publichouse at Barnsley, and were changing several sovereigns, wrhich ecoited remarks from some of the company
hcbw theygot them, as they did nob waok for them. They raid ' None but foola andl horseg worked." The day after !he burglary Dickenson chauged a note at a publichouse on Wor7broug- common, and that note would be traced and shown to be the 51.-note which Mrs. BradUey had asked her husband to give her the niAht before. With regard to Marsden, a witne8s, Sarah Underwood, would state that Eie saw him and aix other men, two of whom were DickenEon and Gledal1, looking over a wall at the back of kir. Bradley's house at 2 o'clock on the day before the robbery. Nothing more was heard of Marsdan until the 4th of the present month, when, from some information i eceived, he VES taken into 'custody at Sheffield. At the time of the burglary he lived near Manor Oaks, but he left t here soon after and went to live at Hampden-view, at the other side of Sheffield. On being taken into custody he was searched, and upon him wrs found a parcel containing the two gold watches stolen from Mr. Bradley's house on the night of the burglary. On beiDg asked about them, he said he had found them in a held near Hampden-view. These were the facts which he submitted brought home the charge to the prisoners.
The learned counsel then called the following witnesses
Mr. Bradley, examined.-I carry on the business of a common brewer at Sheffield, and reside at Manor Oaks, about a mile and a-half from Sheffield. On the night of the 8th of December I went to bed a little after 12 o'clock. I had an elderly lady (the mother of my wife) ill, residing in my house. ln consequence Mrs. Bradley slept in another room to be near her mother. I was aw-kened by my wife. She got hold of me and caUed " William, Wiliam PI Just as I awoke the bathroom door wrs burst open and five men rushed into the room in a body and struck at me. Two of these five men had lights with them; one had a readincandle I had used the night before. The other two had lamys. It was a moonlight night. My bedroom is an ordinara-sized room without shutters, and there was mucb lieht in it. The prisoner Gledall entered my room first. Ue was dressed in fustian trousers. He had a black cotton mask over his face. It waved about and uncovered his face as he moved about. It was loose at bottom with a large hole cut for the eyes. Once or twice the mask moved on one side. To the best of my belief Dickenson was at7 the bottom ef the bed. I could not notice Dicken%on Eo mnch, only the build and style of the man. GledaU had a life-preserver 16 or 18 inches long in his hand. Somebody struck at me when they came in. I cannot tell who. Dickenson had a smock on and a mask. They struck at me with a life-preserver. I cannot tell which of them. They struck me several times on the bed, but I was moved away by my wife. They struck my leg. My vnfe placed herself in front of me, between me and GledU. Gledall repeated his blows, but without much effect, as my wife every time struck his forearm, and broke his blow. They cried out, " Murder him !" One said to the others, " Don't hurt her, she is a good 'un-she is a good sort; I know ber I" From the beginning to the end it must have been half an hour. Something seemed during the blows to run into my elbow joint, and my middle fin-er was broken in two places. They said they wanted my money. I told them they might take it if they would only save my life, and pointed to my breeches. Gledall and a small stiff man I cannot speak to took the trousers. There was about 38.
and among it three Doncaster notes * the rest in sovereigns. In the course of the night I had bad my money out. Mrs. Bradley wes present. I had one of the notes in my hand that night before going to bed. Mrs. Bradley said, "Y ou had better give me that." The note produced is the one. That was one of the notes in my small-clothes' pocket. There were somo drawers in my bedroom. They took a screw-wrench and forced open a drawer. It contained a few brooches and some old coins I had been picking up on the continent all nmy lifetime. I begged them not to take those, they were of little value to them. One of the men made use of a coarse exclamation, and pickedout the silver from the copper coins. They were then going to break open another drawer, but I begged they would not and said I would open it. I opened it and said "There is nothing of any value to youinit -only some title-deeds of no earthly value to you," and one of them, in the politest manner possible, handed the deeds to me. One of them said, " Where is the watch? I know he has got a good one." My wife asked to look at my watch for the last time as they took it away. They then asked where my wife's room was. There was then a call out, "Hurrah, lads, this is the shop !" and immediately boxes were heard breaking. There was much silver plate kept in that room, and my wife kept her trinkets there. One of the men presented a pistol at me, which much alarmed my wife, but I was not the least alarmed as I knew it to be my own and that it was not loaded, and that there were not the materials to load it in the house. After being in my wife's bedroom they, put their heads in my room, used some violent language, and said they should stop two hours, and call again in a week, and threatened us if we made any alarm. I promised not. In about half an hour I heard a boll ring, and went down. Mty wife wanted me to go down before, but I said, "We must keep faith with thieves." I saw two men outside; one a tall man, another about the size of Marsden. On examining the house I found they had made two attempts to break in at the breakfast. room windows. They had broken open several boxes, and had tried some plated things whether they were silver or not, and left them.
Cross-examined by Mr. PI'm.-I was uite unmoved while this was going on, although alasmed. rne of the men looked a little round in his back. The shutters broken were lined with sheet iron, and the wood and iron were all forced out together. My house is a mile and a-half from Sheffield, and five from Rotherham. A great quantity of plate was taken away. They all wore a slouched sort of hat-" billy. cock" sort of hats.
Re-examined.-He had no doubt whatever that Dickenson and Gledall were two of the men. Half a sack would hold all they took. They took two or three stones' weight. There were three silver teapots, three sugar basins, silver spoons, and forks.
Mrs. Charlotte Bradley was then caUed and examined, and gave her evidence in a manner which more than once excited an unrestrainable burst of admiration. She is a tall, stout lady, appaxently about 40 years of age. She said, -I am the wife of the last witness. I remember the evening of the 8th of December last. I came with my husband from the Palace Inn about 7 or 8 o'clock. He examined his money. There was a small old note. I asked for it. I said, " Give me that." He said, " You women never see monev but you want it." I said, "Oh, give me that, it is a shabby one." After going to bed I was disturbed by a noise of breaking windows. i jumped up and rushed into my husband's room. He was asleep. Ijumped onto the bed and put my arms round him and puled him andsaid, "William, WiUiam! I hearanoise in the house." Then the bath-room door was burst open. They rushed in. I said " What do vou want, you vilains ? You are buTglars! You are thievesi" My husband said,
'WVVhatdoyouwant." They said, '"We want your life, you d-d viUain," and they struck a blow at hin. I put the pillow before him, and the blow cut the p Mow.
then pulled my husband out of bed. Gledall struck that blow. All but Dickenson struck him. They never struck me purposely. I was struck twice. One blow broke a tooth and the other struck me on the breast. I turned faint. Wy husband held up his hand to protect himself, and while doing so his finger was broken by a blow. I recovered directly, and asw GledaU repeating the blow am,d grinning as he was doing it, as if about to strike with more force. I immediately struck the muscle of his forearm, and it turnedithe blow on the wall, and I saw the wea-
a was fastened to his wrist, or I would have taken it from m. Dickenson caught me by the nightdress to pull me away, and said, " Don't huxt her." The fastening at the neck broke, and his hand by accident struck my mouth and broke and knocked my tooth out. At the Town-hall, when he was in custody, I went up to him and asked to see his hand. I said, "You see youhave not killed me-let me look at your hand," and he refused. I thought my tooth might have cuthis knuckles. He was the man who broke open the drawer, and I remarked his dexterity in doing it. That man was Dickenson. One of the men said he would take the old lad's watch. I said "Just favour me with a l at look at it." It was half-past 2 o'clock by it.
Cross-examined by Mr. SvruouR.-The men were crying Kll him, kill the old villain, don:t leave him alive ! but don't hurt the woman."
Martha Broomhead, servant to Mr. Bradley, examined.- She heard a great noise about a-quarter past 2 o'clock, and she heard her mistress say " For God's sake don't murder us I" She saw the time by a little timepiece in her room. It was half-past 2 o'clock. Shortly after Daniel Dickenson, the prisoner, came into her room to the bedside, and he took hold of her by the head. She sid " Oh dear I don't hurt us ! andhesaia "D-uyou!liestill,andweiwonthuht a barr of your head." MEary Roebuck was in bed with her. Two other men came into the room and opened the boxes while Dickenson stood at the bedside. They had two lights -one a reading-candle, the other a dark lantern. Theyhad crape on their faces; but she could see-his face as he stood near the window. She had no doubt Dickenson was one of the men.
Cross-examined.-She could not see the skin of Diekenson's face, as it was black. She thoughtit was covered with crape.
Samuel Ienley, inspector of police at Sheffield, examined. -Heard of the burglary at S next morning. He observed footmarks on some flower-beds. Some of the impressions looked as if made by indiarubber shoes. There were some impressions of footmarks, which he covered from the weather. He afterwards received a boot from Inspector Sills (which he produced), and went to Manor Oaks with it. It had eight rows of square nails; six of the rows were not so
odstince as the other two. 'Tihey were on the inside of the sole. He compared the boot with the impressions on the flowerbed at Manor Oaks; they corresponded. He made an impression alongside the others. He afterwards took Dicken son into custody at Barnsley, along with Glover, Goldthorpe, Simpson, and Gledall. Dickenson said he ,was at apublichouse at Rawmarsh till between 12 aud 1 o'cloak on the night of the burglary.
Cross-examined.-Gledall's boots were, not examined till nine days after the burglary.
Joseph Linnaker, a servant of Mr. Bradley, traced the footmarkes on Tuesday the 9th, towvards Darnall, and found two knife boxes, an oilcan, and other articles between 300 and 400 yards from the house, which belonged to his master. HIe saw a boot (the one produced) compared with a foot. print protected by a slate. The marks corresponded ex-
Charles Fowler, examined.-Is a civil engineer. The Manor Oaks is a mile and a-half from Sheffield, a mile and a-quarter to the Globe Inn at Darnall. It is 54 mriles from Manor Oaks to Ecclesfield-common, to Hoyland 10 miles, to Qross Keys on Hoyland-common I0Q miles, to Bordswell Iliamiles. Rawmiarsh is 73 miles from Manorn Oaks.

They were tallish men, They had something like a bundle handkerchief .with them. Two of them were carrying. one bundle betwixt them. It seemed to be heavy.
Samuel Hallam, examined.-I live at Longley, near Ecclesfield-common. I went to work on Tuesday morning, the 9th of December, with my brother.

Eight or nine sovereigns were changed by them. They paid for quarts with sovereigns. Dickenson pad me a sovereign. Thorpe and Atkinson were there.
nen they kept giving witness sovereigns for quarts some one in the company (Thorpe or Atkinson) said they wondered were the devil they got their money from, they did not work for it. Thomas Simpson replied, "- It is only fools and horses that work."

On the 4th of Mfarch I apprehended MAarsden. He was standing looking through a window. I asked him if his neme was Brown. He said it was not; it was Marsden. I searched him at tho Town-hall, and found a parcel in his left hand breast pocket. I asked him what it was. He said it was nothing to me. I asked a second time what the parcel contained, and he said it was two watches. I opened it and found two gold watches and keys. He said he found them in a feld at the back of Hampden-view. It is on the oppoaste side of the town to Manor Oaks, four nnlsofIt is on the read to Ecclesfield, not directly to Bdassl.ey. It would ho a couple of miles from that
Cross-examined by Mr. FOSTEs.-The place where he said he found it was asout a mile and a-half from the road to Ecolesfield. There were new houses unfinished tbere. Hampden-view was in the outskirts of Sheffield.
Mr. Raynor, inspector of police at Sheffield, received from Inspector Sills two watches and two keys, which he produced.
Mrs. Bradley identified both the watches and keys.
E. Wright examined.-Was in the courtyard with Dickenson and Gledall. Heard them talking. Dickenson said, sthold they get off the present charge he would not get . next time with a few scratches and bruises; he would have his b- jemmy croaked. He did not know who they were speaking about.
Susannah Uinderwood.-I am wife of William IUnderwood, and live in Camp's-lane, Sheffield. I formerly lived mnBarnsley. I carry about cottons to sell. I was passing Manor Oaks at 2 o'clock onthe day of the burglary. I saw Marden, Dickenson, GledaD], and Simpson. They were at the back of Mr. Bradley's house. They got up some steps and looked over a wall They were a couple or dozen yards off the house. I wentforward andleft them there. I came back attho edge of dusk, about4 o'clock. I saw four of them going up the steppings again they went up before. One of them said " Here is the same woman again.P Gold. thorpe and GledaU I had known before. Dickenson and GleaD ere two of the men. I did not know the others. I have seen Marsden several times since then, but did not know his name. Up by Mr. Bradley's house after the burglary MArsden pxut up his hand to me and toldme not to own him.
William Bishop, sciSSor grinder, examined.-Marsden livedtwodoorsfromme, andnear Mr. Bradley's. He removed after the burglary. The burglary was a long while before he removed.
Examined by Mr. FosTEr.-He was drinkiDng at the Cricket Inn with Marsden til near 1 o'clock on the night of te burglary. Masekn was drunk, and left with his wife
r 1X: o'clock. YHe saw him at his own house At dinner next day. Helved near Mr. Bradley's. The Cricket Inn was half a-mile from Mr. Bradley's.
This was the case for the proSecution.
- Mr. PRIwo then addressed the jury for the defence, rely. ing on several small discrepancies in the evidence against Dickenson as weakening it and then said ho should prove an alibi, accounting for the whole of the time of the burglary, and showing that Dickenson was not present.
Mr. SxsIout, on behalf of his client commented on the mode in which a comparison bad been made with the boot and the foot-print in the garden of Mr. Bradley's house, which he said was not satisfactory, and also on the absence of witnesses who might have been called to establish the identity of his client.
Mr. FoSTmi, on behalf of Marsden, submitted that the strength of the case for the prosecution told in his clients favour, me witnesses had been called who saw the burglars, and not one of them had identified his client. If the accuracy of their observation were to be relied on, it was impossible to have stronger evidence that he was not at the burglary. With regard to the property stolen found upon him he submitted that it was probable enough that the prisoner's account, that he had found it in a field at Haml.
en-view, was true, as the burglars had passed on their route within a mile of the place, and they might have secreted it there; and the prisoner, living in the neighbour. hood, might possibly have found it as he stated. The evidence of the woman Underwood he stigmatised as unworthy of credit; and without that evidence there was nothing to connect the prisoner with the burglary, and at most he could only he convicted of the minor charge. If they believed.his story, which was from his conduct probablytrue, they must acquit him altogether.
The case was then adjourned to this morning.
Mr. PBICE then called witnesses to prove his alibi, which was that the prisoner Dickenson was drinking at a publichouse in Rawmarsh till a quarter past 12, with Gledall and others, and that they were betting about the Liverpool races. Several witnesses were called to prove this.
To contradict this evidencewitnesses were called to prove that it was practieable by getting on a luggage-train at Masborough, at 20 minutes to I1a.m., tobe at Sheffield at 1, and easily to be at Manor-house, a mile-and-a-half off, at the time the burglary was committed.
Mr. PRaCE having replied on this evidence. Mr. OvERlND rephed on the whole case.
His LoBi:sImp, m summing up directed the jury that theyt must find the prisoners guilty or not guilty, according to the evidence which affected each. Hi Lryd ship then went through the whole evidenco as fecting each prisoner with remarkable clearness. As regarded the pzrsoner Marsden, the evidence of the witness Under. wood was most important, as connecting him with the other prisoners, but that evidence was the subject of considerable observation. She said she had told the constable that night she had seen the prisoner, among other men, looking over the wall at the back of -M. Bradley's house. Why should she have done so, and, having done so, why had the authorities not examined her and inquired into her evidence before this trial ? If her statement were true, and she had been wilfully kept back, it was excessively wrong. Her evidence, under all the circumstances, ought to be looked upon with very great suspicion. If they were not satisfied t at her evidence was to be relied upon, then the possession of the stolen property by the pnsoer, unaccounted for, would warrant them in finding bErsden, uilty of receiving the property knowing it was stolen. They must take a
the circumstances into their consideration, and find their verdicts accordingly with regard to each of the pi isoners.
The jury retired, and after an absence of about two houts found all the prisoners guilty of the burglary.
The priqoners were then asked if they had anethin; to say why sentence of death should not be recorded against them by the clerk of arraigns.
His Losi ', in passing sentence, said they bad aU been found guilty of one of the most barbarous burglaries that he had ever had proved before himu. He had tried mant cases of this kind, butb this was the only case in which
wanton violence and barbarous cruelty had been offered where no resistance was made. It was quito unnecessary to offer violence to anybody. But they had beaten Mr. Bradley while lying naked in his bed, and but for the affection and wonderful courage of his wife, which had excited the admiration of every paerson who had heard the evidence, they would probably have murdered him and wonldnow havehad theirlivesforfeited. Asitwas,it was his duty to order sentence of death to be recorded against them, and he had had some doubt whether he should not allow that sentence to bo carried oui, as he thought it not wise that the sentence pronounced should not take effect. However, as in cases of this kind it was not the practice so to do, their lives would be spared, but, it was his duty to say, only on the condition of t heir receiving the next higltest punishment known to the law, that they should spendthe rest of their lives as slaves. One of them had used an expression
that nonebut fools andhorses worked" as applied tohonest labour, but they would find that they would pass their lives as slaves, and would ho made to work for the benefit of others, receiving no benefit themselves. The sentenco of theCourt was that thtey ho severally transported for their
His Lo sDm then tried a charge of perjury of an unusual character.
Edward Sedgfield Donner was indicted for perjury in an answer tG a bil in Chancery.
Mr. BliSS, Q.C., nd Mr. Bower prosecuted, and Mr. Knowles, Q.C,, and Mr. Overend, Q.C., defended.
It appeared that one William Hudson Denton was interested.in.certatn lands settled by his father on himself and brothers as trstees, and that the defendant, who Vas
stated to be a highly.respectable solicitor at Scarborough, was employed as the attorney to me the deed and subseuently toraea loan on the securitv of the deed. Mr.
onner hstself lent the money and became mortgagee.
Te debt and interest not being paid he became the purchaser. Subsequently a bil in Chanery was filed to set
aside, this purchase on the ground thatat the timethe Dade it he wasactingas the attorney for the vendor, and in the answer to that bill the defendant swore that in that transaction he was not acting as the attorney for the prosecutor, nor as his agent in any way Onthis statement the perjury wa asigned. Alter the necessary formal proofs DIenton was called and proved these facts, and on the case for the prosecution being closed,
His LoRDsms -was most clearly of opinion that there was no cas. It was clear that Mr. Donner's statement was true, because he stood in this transaction, not in the relation of attorney, but of mortgagee. In addition to that the evidence of the prosecutorwasuncorrobarated. The jury -must therefore fnd him NYot Gulut.
Mr. KNowLEs said he might say that the answer had been drawn by Mr. Lewin, of the Chancery bar, with a *fc]l kowledge of all the facts, and he had deliberately ad* vEed this answer.

WillamMorris BIking, 58, a respectable-looking welldressed man, described as a solicitor, and Martha Neale, alias Elkirg, alias Matilda Spencer, 40s a well-dressed womnhn, were jomtly indicted for feloniously forging and uttering an acceptance to a bill of exchange with intenst to defraud Jxmnes Barber.
fr. Johnson conducted the prosecution. The prisoners -were undefended.
The prosecutorof this indictment is an upholsterer at Chichester, and on the 24th of January the prisoners, who representedthemelyes to he man and wife, went to his shop and stated that they had taken a house in the town, and they wished him to furnish it upon the terms that the furnituro WaS to be paid for in three months, and a biU of exchange, accepted b a responsible person, should be given for the amount. Tho prosecutor consented to this arrangement, and upon hss inquiring swho the person was that wastoaccept the bill the male Prisoner told him it was a lay named Matilda Spencer, wjho lived at Portsmouth, and who possessed considerable property Eurniture to the amount of between 1201. and 14t
was tben selected by the prisonera, but the prosecator refused to part with any of itnntil the bill was given to him, and, on te 28th of JaPuryr, te male psisoner drew thebil; in question inrhis presence, nd told him thatho shonld send it to Portsmnouth forMliss Spencer to accept, and took it away asith him. A day or two afterwardis he again brought the bill to the prosecutor, and it then purported to he accepted by Mtatilda Spencer, of Portsmoutb, and on the prosecutor remarkingthatPortsmnonth was alarge pilace, and tbat some more definite addresshad better be given, the male -risoneradded thewords "High-street,"andthen handed the pil to the prosecutor,expectingatoncetoobtainpossessionof thefurniture hehad selected. Theprosecutor, it would seem, however, had some suspicion that aU was not right, and he at once proceeded to Portsmouth to look after the supposed acceptor of the bill, but he could find no such personas Matilda Spencer in the town, and upon his return to Chichester he gave the prisoners into custody, and when they were before the magistrate the woman said that her name was Matilda Spencer, and that she had written the acceptance at the request of the other prisoner, but she declared at the same time that she was not at all aware that by so doing sbe was acting contrarv to the law.
The prisoners, when called upon to answer the charge, denied that they had any intention to defraud the prosecutor.
The jury found them both Guilty.
Mr. Justice CtEsswwE, in passing sentencep, said, there could be no doubt from the proceedings which had been adopted by the prisoners that they were regular swindlers and got a livelilood by defraudinz tradesmen in this manner. lie was not aware whether the male nrisoner had ever belonged to the profession of the law, but there was no doubt that he ad some smattering knowledge of it, and that he fancied he could commit a fraud of this kind, and yet escape the legal consequences bp the mode he adopted to carny it out. He wes, however, mistaken, and the prisoners had been very properly convicted of the offence alleged against them, and the sentence he had to pass upon them was that they be severally kept in penal servitude for four yeasrs.
Eleanor Jane Harper, 29, a respectable-lookingyoung woman, was indicted or stealing several articles of wearing apparel and linen, the property of Sir Thomas Tancred.
Mr. Johnson prosecated; Mr. Creasy was counsel for the defence.
It appeared from the evidence of Lady Tancred, who was the princpal witness for the prosection5 that the prisoner wa.s taken into her estabishment at Tilington, near Petworth, on the 6th of December last, as nursemaid, and that she very shortly afterwards gave notice of her intention to quit the service, on the 6th of January. She contnued to perform the duties of her situation until the Ist of January, when the prisoner appears to have conducted herself in a very extraordinary manner, and insisted upon leaving the house of the prosecutor isniediately. Lady Tancred; it appeared, asked her for the keys of some presses and drawers that had been intrusted to her, and at the same time made an observation to the effect that one of the children had aeen the prisoner removing some rolls of linen from a cupboard. The prisoner upon this became very violent, and said that if Lady Tancred charged her with stealing sho would cut her throat, and that in half an hour she shouldbe in eternity, and that her death would be at her door. She then, it appeared, tore herclothesand rushed intoher own bedroom, and ILdyTancred, feaning ahe would reaUy commit some niolence upon herself, followed her; and the prisoner then asked that a policeman might be sent for to search her boxes if she was suspected of having stolen any of her mistress's property. SirThomas Tancred it appeared was in London at the time, and there was no one in tho house but her ladyship and some female domestics, and she was so much alarmed at the prisoner's conduct that she sent for Mr. Ridsdale, the curate of the parish, and he remonstratedwith the prisoner upon the impropriety of her conduct, but this did not appear to have much effect, At length the prisoner packed up her boxes andwas paidher wages and left, giving an intimationthatshewas going toMaidstone, and very shortly afterwardsLadyTan-ed discoveredthatagreatmanyarticles of wearing apparel and other property were missing. Information was consequently given to the police at Maidstone, and the prlsoner was taLen into custody in that town, and, upon her boxes beimg taken back to Tillington and searched, the whole of the missingproperty was found in them s but it appeared that while she was being conveyed to Maidstone sbe asserted that if any things were found in her boxes that belonged to lady Tancred she knew nothing about them, and they had been placed there by some person to get her into trouble. There did not appear, however, to be the slightest foundation for this suggestion, and the officer stated that when he was about to examine one of the prsoner's boxes she told him it was no use doing so, as it had never been unpacked since she had entered the service but upon his proceeding with his search he found at the bottom of the oox two silk handkerchiefs belonging to Sir Thomas Tancred, from which the name had been cut out.
Mr. CREAsy made a Tery ingenious addres to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and he particularlv pressed upon their attention the fact that she had herself requested that her boxes might be searched, and the great improbability that she would have done this if she had been aware that they contained stolen property.
The jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of Guilty.
Sentence was postponed.

HCKMAN AND OTHERS V. WVILLAXS.
Mr. Keating, Q.C., BIr. APMahon, and Mr. R. Kettle anpeared for the plaintiffs; fr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. Griy for the defendant.
The paintiffs in this action-George H. Hickman and Alfred Hickman-were ironmasters in a large way of business in South Staffordshire, and they sued the defendant Pbilip Wiliams, the Chairman of the Ironmasters AssociatiGn, to recover damages for slanderous words spoken by the defendant respecting the plaintiffs in the way of their b'usiness, imputing to them that they were in insolvent mrcumstances. It appeared that tho plaintiffs in the year 1855 had stopped payment, their liabilities being upwards of 11610001. ; but they arranged with their creditors, and gave an undertaking for the payment of 10s. in the pound. They afterwards continued their business, and had already paid 7s. 6d. in the pound when the defendant, on the 11th or 12th of November, 1856, aid to Mbr. Ryland, an extensive metal broker, who called u n him, "Have you heard that the HEckmans have the bains in possession of the Leabrook Works D Mr. Ryland thoughtthe statement so important that he went to a manufacturer, with whom he had contracted to deliver a quantity of iron to the plalntiffl, and communicated the information. Subsequently, on the 13th of November, the defendant at Birmingham said to a Mr. Wainwright, in the presence of the manager of the National and Provincial Bank, "I suppose it is no news to you to hear that Hickmans are again in trouble, and that the bailiffs are in possession o the Tleabrook Works, which are stopped." Wainwright and the manager told the defendant it could not be true, for the plaintiffs had recently paid the third instalment of their composition. Immediately afterwards he told a Mr. Matthews, another ironmaster, that the bailiffs were in possession of the leabrook Worlk, and that he had heard it from Mr. Morris or from Mr. Jones. The plaintiffs on the 22d of November wrote to the defendant to know upon what authority the statement was made. The defendant answered, "In reply to your amusing note, witten I suppose after dinner, I must refer to Mr. Morris ;" but Mr. Morris, on being written to, denied the authority. The only question was as to the amount of damages.
Mr. Justice CROWDER having summed up the evidence, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-damages, 1501.
SHOOLERED AND OTHS V. AXMSTRO1cG 4sD ANOTHER.
MIr. Gray aud Mr. Cook Evans appeared for the plaintiffs; Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. Phipson for the defendants,
The plaintiffs in this action, Messrs. Shoolbred and Co., were japanned-ware manufacturers at Wolverhampton and they sued the defendants, Messrs. Armstrong ana Haddock, who were formerly Ironmongers at Sunderland, to recover the sum of 841. 5s., being the amount due to the plaintiffs for goods supplied by the plaintiffs to the derendants. The defendant Armstrong suffered judgment to go by default; but the defendant dock, among other pleas, pleaded that his partnership with Arm tron was dissolved iu April, 1856, and that it had been agreed between theplaintiffs and defendants that the plaintiffsahould accept Armstrongs sepat liability, and release the defendant Haddock from all liability in respect of the said debt; and that, in pursuance of the sid agreement) the plaintiffs took
Armstron#'s acceptance for the amount, It appeared from I the- laintiffs evidence that the goods in question were suppl.in to the defendants before the dissolution of the part, nership, which tookplace on the 18th of April, 1856. On that occasion a circolar was sent round to all the creditors of the flrmt statig thast in fnture the defendant ALrmstrong would carry on the business alone, "aind that ail debts due *to and owing by the said firm will be received and paid by the said B. Armstrong." On the th of June the plaintiffs' traveller called at the defendants' usual place
of busines at Sunderland, and TvO in their account with Aitnstrong, sanoarAing to 84. The usual course was to draw a bil at three maonths, and some conversation having On place, in which it was mentioned that Haddock bIdleft the firm, the traveller was told to draw upon
B. Armstrong and Co." for the amount. This was done, and the bll was accepted by B. Armstrong and Co.; but before it became due te bill was retired and a new one accejpted. This seoond bill became due on the 19th of Sep. tember, but was dishonoured. After the dissolution of tho partnership the plaiftiffibadsupplied goods to Armstrong to heamount of 91. on his separate liability; but towards
e nd of the year 1856 Armstrong became insolvent, and proposed.a coenposition with his creditors, The plaintiffs,
owever, suea the defendwnts for the partnership debt, and now suggested that Haddock had taken all thecapital, 8001, out of the firm, and left Armstrong with the bad debts to meet the liabiiies.
ir. W Aarzxy called the defendant Armstrong to prove that the greement set forth in the plea had been entered Into between the parties, but tho witness did not state that any such areement had been expressly entered into, so that the defendant Haddock's case rested chiefly on the circular, and the fact that the plaintiffs had taken Armstrong's bill for the amount due by the partnership.
Mr. Justice Cnowm%, in summing up, said, in the ordinary course both the parties would be liable; bet his Lordship left it to the jury to say, upon the evidence, whether
te defendant Haddock hada proved his plea.
Thejury foundfor the platntiff for the amount claimed,

Josep h Embury, aged 40, boatman, and Joseph Edwards, aed 3u also a boatman, were charged with stealing one ton of iron, the froperty of Benjamin Gibbons, at Tipton, on the l9th of February, 1857.
Mr. J. Cook Evans and Mr. Chance appeared for the prosecution; the prisoners 'were undefended.
This was one of several procecutionm instituted by the ironmasters of South Staffordshire, charging tho prisoners who were boatmen on the Birminghamn Canal, with bein'
concerned in some wholesale robberies of iron committed on
It appeared that on the 21st of February a policeman saw the two prisoners wheeling a barrow from Dudley-port to iorseleynheath. He followed them about 200 yards to a marine store dealer's, and then went up to them and asked them w'hat they bad got in the barrow. They said they had got nothing but old rope, but the policeman upset the barrow and found that it contained iron underneath the rope. He asked them where they lived, and they said they lived "nowhere" but that they were "leggers"-i. c, men who get their living by working boats through the canal tunnel by lying on their backe and working the boet forwardwith their legs. The policeman asked if they had any boat, and they sPi they had not. He, however, followedthe track of the wheelbarrow back to the canal at Dudlevport, and there he found a boat with the name of ' Witshaw" painted on it. On examining tho boat, he found that it contained as much as 5 tons of iron, covered over with coal and slack, About one ton of the iron so found wa in pigs, witL the prosecutor's mark upon it. In order to connect the prisonerswith the boat it was sbown taat in the maonth of September last they bac hired it of "'Wilshaw" the owner. It was Proved that onthe 17th of I i'ebrn a;ismbui bad purchaseo 4h tons of coal and 2 tons of kc and put them intothis boat,whichat that time was empty, and remained till tho next day near the same place, which was not far from the prosecutor's works, situate on the canal, and called Corbyn's-hal New Furnaces. About midday onthe 18th Emhuryandanotbermantooktho boat past the prosecutores work, and through the Bronmleylock, and remained between that lock and the Nine Locks, distant onlytwomilesa part until some timethenextday. On the fternoon of the 18th the prosecutor's man had taken a boatload of pig iron of 20 tons, and left it, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, moored between the two locks. At 1 o'clock a.m. on the 19th he took the load down the canalto Messrs. Cockrane's works at Woodssde; and it was then found that there were only 19 tons of iron, and that one ton had been taken out during the night. It was shown that when Embury pamsed the romley-lock he produced a printed form, tDed op by himself, describing his cargo as consisting of ' 10 tons of coals," though in fact, when gauged, it was more than 11 tons, and when he i7ent through the Nine Iocks it was t edat12 tons and more. He accounted for the overwei ht hy saying that the boat leeked, but this was proved to be untrue. he pigs found in the prisoner's boat on the 21st of February at Dadley-port were identified by the prosecutor's marks upon them, and they made up the exact weight of iron which had been missed. The pnsoner Embury cross-examined the witnesses with some ingenuity, but the Edwards asked no questions.
Mr. Justice Wiuxs thought there was no case against Edwards, and then summed up the case against Embary.
The ijry found Embuzy Guiiky and Acqpuatd Edwards.
It was then proved against Embury that in March, 1855, he had been convicted of stealing three tons of pig iron from a boat, and sntenced to eight months' imprisonment.
Mr. Coox EvNs said, there was another indictment againt the prisoners, but as thera was no evidence to convict Edwards, with his Lordship's sanction he would offer no evidence.
Mr. Justice WIu5s then directed an acquittal to be taken on the second charge. His Lordship said that in general he did notlike to pass such severe sentences for offences a-ainst property as for crimes of violence, but, as it appearea the prisoners bad taken to a life of thievin, and the property was necessailymuchexposed,hePfeltbound a sentence of four years' penal servitude, pam a ese-

This morning the Crown Court was opened at 10 o'clock, with a calendar containing the names of 11 prisoners, including 1 chargo of arson, 1 of burglary, 3 of laceny, and 2 other cases of a rather unusual character. In the first of these a father and two of his daughters are charged with assaulting, starvng, and imprisoning for the spaco of three years a third daughter of the male prisoner, with intent to kill and murder her. In the second case a mother is charged with exposing and deserting her infant child in a field without suffident food and covering from the inclemency of the weather. On the cvil gide we have again to recorda blank, Indeed, all private litigation would seem to be " standing at easo " in the presence of political strife, John Bull being an animal who cannot do two things at once.

William Brown, aged 31, and Joseph Hart, aged 37, aere indicted for setting fir to a stack of haulm, at Wenning. toni, on the 12th of February last.
IMr. Power appeared for the prosecution; the prisoners were undefended.
It appeared that theprisoners were tramps, and that a day before the fire they so cited chadty from a poor cottager, who referred them to the farmers. To this Brown said, with an oath, that "it was no use asking the -'farmers, for they never gave anything to the poor, and ought to go to burning hell, where he wished to see them go." On the following day both tho men presented themselves at the kitchen door of the prosecutor, who is a farmer, and asked foralms. Being met by a refusal, Brown left his companion at the door parleying with the cook, and was seen by a 3oan at work in a barn to go up to the stack in question and thrast his hand into it. After this he returned to Hart, and then they both quittedtthe premises, but had hardlygot off them when names were seen to burst out of the stack in the spot to which Brown had gone. Being pursued, the two prisoners were soon taken into custody on this charge.
The CmxF BARox having expressed the opinion that there was no caso whatever against Hart, the case was abandoned as far he was concerned.
Brown, however, was Convided without any hesitation and retired from the dock, howling like a wild beast when he' received sentence of transportation for 14 years.
Edward Crewe, aged 54; Rebecca Crewe, aged 23; and Eliza Crewe, aged 21, were indicted for assaulting irtha Crewe and imprisoning her for three years, and refusing and
neglecting to supply her with prproosffcetfAadd
medicine during that period,
Mr. TozEs appeared for the prosecution, which, he sated, resolved iLtself into a charge of unlawful imprison. ment, and called several witnesses, who proved that the xubject of the indictment was the daughter of the male prisoner, and the sister of the two others. From the account Of the nei hbours it a*peared that the poor creature, who ofs 19the e nht, been confined - closo ri soner in the house of her father from February 53 1854, to August 18 1856; that during that period she had been heard to cry "Murder I" and to call out for food on several occasons, On one occasion the constable broke into the house, and, seeing the girl on the sta irs,asked if she wished to go away, and receiving a reply in the negative left her as he found her. From that period, which was earl in 1854, tho neighbours did not see the girl at all till the 18th of August, 1856, when she appeared at a neighbour's house in a greatly emaciated state, and solicited food and help. She was soon followed by her sisters, who took from her the food which had been placed in hier hands, and, saying that she should suffer for this;, took her back with them in thier aims to the house. Upon this the parish authorities repaired to tho house, where they found the poor creature in the hold of her sisters, who refused to let her go, though she beggod to be taken to the union. This was done and when she was there she was found to weigi only 561b. The medical men who examined and at. tended her stated that, though she was so reduced as to bo a mere keleton they could not undertake to say that her state *as attrbutableto want of food, for she was evidently labouringundersirofula, the tendency of which was to createanmorbid craving for food, while she was also of evldently-weak intellect, and died soon after her removaL.
The.4ther, when called en to defend himself, stated he had been left a widower, 13 years ago, with seven children, three of wlhom had died before Martba ; that he had endured trials and trbulations with patience, as he looked apon tlmm as the infidction of God, With respect to Martha, he added that he had suffered greatly on oer c count, That her appetite for food was inordinato. That she was alwaysunsatisfied, no matter how much she ate, and had often cried for foodl when ahe had some bread in her pocket. The dauhterssaid nothing.
TheCrUzFBAxo0 said, in summingupthecasetothe jUry;that it had been very correctly described by the leared counsel as one of illegal imprisonment only, and the question for them was whether Martha Crewe had been deprived of her personal liberty by the prisoners, or either of them, from any motive other than the desire to take care
of her. If any motive but that had caued that long, u- wholeEome, and dre imprisonment the prisoners were gulty of assault and imprisonment, but otherwise they would be entitled to an acquittal.
The jury having returned a general verdict of Gtilly,
The Ciuzy BARoN, in pasdng sentence upon them xaid that while he concurred with the jury, it was impossible tot to feel great sympathy for the distress of a family deprived of a mother to early, and perishing, one after another, of the sarne disease, no doubt, which ultimately killed the sister Martha. Though something was possible to be said in explanation of the illtreatment, they had no justiflcation for it in law. They had been guilty of cruelty, harshners, and unk}ndness to a relative; but cruelty was not to be suppreseed by cruelty. The object of the prosecution was to prevent the head of a family from supn poeingthat he could treatany member of his family in ths way, unless he could show that such treatment was adopted from the sole purpose of benefiting its object. It was impossible to understand how and why the neighbours allowed such a state of things to continue ro lang. Boththe medical men agreed in saying that a morbid appetite for food was a symptom of the disease under which the deceased vas found tolabour when rescned from imprisonment, so that the simple question was whether thatimprisonmentwas dictated byanyotbermotivewhatever than the desire to protect and benefit idarthaCrewe, and en that point it was clear that, if any blame attached to the psoners, the greater portion attached to the male prisoner e. sentence thereforo wvas that lie should be im-prisoned for threemonths,and his dau gters for one month, mnconsidera. tionxof thaefactthattheya alreadybeen imprisoned for six months.

This was an action for the pulling down of a newlybuilt house in a narrow alley called Fergusson-street, n Nottingham. The defendants, who are members of the Hlighway Board, pleaded not guilty by statute; that the close was not the plaintiffs'; and a justification that the building was an encroachment upon the bighvay.
It appeared from the opening of counsel that the street mamed, which adjoined the Southwell-road, was crected by one Samuel Booth, as long ago as 1824, and that at one end was p laced a post, and at the other a slaughteFhouEe, with a door contrived so as to entirtly close that end when deemed necessary by the tenant. That about 1840 some cross walls were built, at the request of the tenants, by which means the street was converted into a series of little courts. In 1837 the plaintiffs became the mortgagees of the premises by transfer from previous encumbracers, and in 1848 too possession of the whole ofthe houEes. In the course of that year they pulled down tho cross walls, and also, in 1850, the slaughterhouse; sai
thus, except as regards the post already mentioned, and'a nrinal which they put upon the site of the old open,ing, left the ends free. They also permitted a broker, who was resident in the street, to place his wares all tho way dove the street on one Fide; and these remained until 18g, when the plaintiffs pulled down a house at the extreme end of their property, and proceeded to take in about a yafd additional out of the space hitherto covered by the brokers' articles. Upon this they began a new house, and wben the walls had proceeded to the height of four feet the defendants interferod, and upon the plaintiffs' agent declining to alter the plans, partly upon the ground that sufficient time was not allowed, even if there was any right at all to interfere, upon the Monday succeeding the Saturday upon wbich notice had been given pulled down the whole wall and also, as alleged, dug up the foundations also. The learned counsel stated that there was no desire to obtain damages, but simply to try the question of highway or no; but he complained strongly of what he caeled the needless interference of the Board, and of the vexatious method vhich had been adopted to obtain a legal settlement of this question, when the removal of a few bricks would have answered every purpose
Upon the tbtledeeds being, in the first place, put in, it appeared that the first mortgage, of which the plaintiffs' was on y a transfer, only conveyed the houses, and not the land in front.
Mr. MACAVLAY objected that the legal estate in the locus in Suo was still in the mortgagor, and that he ought to have sued.
Mr. YEXRxTsvzs submitted that the words of the deed wvould carry this land, and also that the plaintiffs had suficient title by possesion to maintain the action.
The learned JuDiE, however, considered that the wrong parties had sued, and nonsuited the plaintiffs, staying the postea, on the application of Mr. Merewether.

The commission for holdinig the assizes in the county of Devon was opened in this city yesterday by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and Mr. Justice Williams. There was great excitement caused by the circumstance of the Lord Chief Justice being one of the judges, as it was in the city of Exeter thathe commenced the career which has been. so eminently sucoessfuL All seemed anxious to show respect to the man whose vast talent they had originally discovered and afterwards nurtured, and he must have been. proud indeed to again visit in his high position the old city where he first commenced his forensic labours.
After having opened the commission at the Castle, the learned judges attended Divine service at the Cathedral.
This morning the business commenced, the Lord Chief Justico sitting at Nisi Prius, and Mr. Jttstice Williams presiding in tho Crown Court. There were 12 causes entered, 6 of which were marked for special juries. There were 32 prisoners for trial, and the 'offences were very heavy,murder, manslaughter, arson, burglary, cutting and wounding, unnatural offnce, highway robbery, bigamy, adminizterin noxious drugs with intent, perjury, &c.

The prisoner was a farrier and horse iobber, going about to fairs and markets. On the 25th of Iovember ho went to South Brent, to the London Inn there, which was kept by a Mrs. Ward. He told her he had come over to purchase some ponies for the clergyman of his parish. He had some r- freshment, and then asked Mrs. Ward to give him change for a 56-note. Mrs. Ward asked him of what bank it was 2 Ho said, " Bank of England ;" and he gave her one from a roll of notes. She asked him if it was a ood one. Here plied that it was perfectly good, and wished he had 100 of them, and he added that he received it of his master, the clergyman, the day before, in order to pay for the ponies. Mrs. Ward gave him change. She looked particulatly at the note, and saw some names upon It, which enabled her to identify the note. She afterwards paid the note away, but it was returned to ber as a forged note. Tho prisoner was apprehended, and lie then said that he had received the note ho bad given to Mre. Ward from a person named Lambert, in payment for a horse which he had sold him. The clergyman, it turned out, had not sent the prisoner to purchase ponies.

Mr. Sloigh.-I now apply that the further hearing of this matter may stand adjourned till this day wtek. Your Lordship will, probably, not call upon me to state my rea, sons for making this applcation. 1 think it my duty to do so, and I do not think my friend will object to this conse.
Mr. Robinson.-Oh, no; we are quite prepred to give the fuUest explanation of this matter. In all probability ihere has been some misunderstanding, but I quite accede - to the suggestion of my friend.
Mr. Sleigh.-My friend speaks of some misunderstandIng. I think it richt, on the part of my clients, to say that this prosecution has been instituted without, I am quite zatisfied any misunderstanding on their part. I will say no more. Iy friend thought proper to volunteer an observation. and that is my reply to it.
*r. Robinson-I did volunteer an observation. I ani perfectly satisfied that there arc many facts in this case of which his Lordship is not aware.
The LORD MAYOR.-If there are any difaculties at all I wil go on with the case.
Mr. Robinson.-I do not think there are any. I think it a very great pity that my friend should make an observation of that kind. I believe that the defendants have a complete answer to this charge.

At the last examination Mr. Morris, one of the prosecutars, produced a receipt for 30., which had been given by the prisoner to the managing clerk of Messrs. Wilde and Co., solicitors of CoUege-hiU, in settlement of a claim in connexion with St. Bartholomew's HospitaL. Mr. Morris stated that the prisoner had net accounted to the firm for the 30l.
Mr. Humphreys said he should proceed with two other out of a great many charges against the prisoner, and then ask for a committal.
Mr. John Morris was sworn, and, in continuation of the Eirt charge against the prisoner, said,-The money, according to the receipt, appears to have been paid on the Uth of August last. Since that time I have repeatedly spoken to the prisoner upon the subject. I inquired of him the state of the negotiation respecting the matter pending between our house and the solicitors of St. Bartholomew's Ho itaL Iis answers generally were, that he had not been a5fle to settle the matters with them. I therefore believed that no money had been paid. The prisoner was taken into custody at my office. My partner charged him in my presence with having robbed us, and he replied, " Yes, Sir, it is true." I asked him to what extent, when he replied, "About 2001. or 3001." After he was in custody I found in his drawer two blank formis of receipt, which I produce.
Mr. J. MtEvily, a saddler, carrying on business at 26, Great Portland-street, said,-On the 16th of January last I paid the prisoner on account of his employers 171.; on the 29th of the same month I paid him 51., and on the 5th of February ol. I produce the receipts for these several
Mr. T.Down.-I am managing clerk to Messrs. Wilde and Co., of College-hill, who are solicitors to St. Bartholomew's Sospital. On the 7th of August last I received a check for 30l. from the derk of the hospital, and on the 11th of the name month I paid it to the prisoner on account of his em1ployers, and he wrote me the receipt now produced.
Mr. W. Mayor, cashier to the prosecutors, proved that the prisoner had not accounted to the firm for the several Rumns alluded to by the preceding witnesses.
Mr. Robinson declined putting any questions to the wit-
Mr. Humphreys asked for a committal upon the three eharges above deposed to.
The prisoner, who, after the usual caution, declined aaking any defence, and said he should leave his case in ;the hands of his counsel, was fully committed for trial to the Central Criminal Court, the IOBD MAYOR refusing to *ake bail for his appearance there.
GUILDnALL.-Francis Burgess, a young man of renpectable conne;dons, described in the ppolce-sheet as a clerk, residing at 5, Arthur-street east, appeared on bail before Alderman LAWRNCE to answver a charge of assaultmng a woman by indecently exposing himself to her in St. Andrew's Church, Holhorn, during the performance of Divine service.
The ALDiWn-iAN said, he felt the defendant's offence was such a breach of public decency and morals that he should not be doing his duty did he not visit it with the full penalty tho law allowed. The sentence, therefore, was that the de. fondant be imprisoned for three months, with bard labour, in the House of Correction at Holloway.
This decision appeared to take the defendant by surprise, as he evidently anticipated merely a fine.
As the prisoner was being removed the Alderman remnarked that the prosecutrix had conducted herself with great propriety in giving her evidence.
BoNV-STvxENr.-Joseph Thomas, one of the fellows known as " duffers," who infest the Strand, and live by entrapping foolish people into the purchase of pretended bargams, wvbich invariably turn out utterly worthless, was brought up on remand on a charge of this nature.
Sergeant AUen, of the Seats Fusileer Guards, was stopped in the Strand on Tuesday evening of last week by a man who invited him to purchase some cigars which he had to sell at very low prices. The proposition was accompanied with a hint about a ship's steward. AUen went with the stranger to a publichouse, the Goldsmith's Arms in Bedfordbury, where he was introduced to the prisoner, who Was dressed in the style of a seafaring man, and who enacted the part of the ship's steward. Alien was kept in conversation, the matter of the cigars being postponed on the ground that a third member of the party, who was absent, had the key of the chest. In the meanwhile the prisoner produced a ring, offering to sell it much below its value, which he said was 30s. He assured Allen that it was of gold, and the latter ultimately boughf it for Gs. The money was taken by the other man. The prisoner next produced a watch chain, which also he represented to beof gold, and which Allen ultimately purchased for 10s. and his own (silver) guard. He then went away delighted with his bargain, but in the course of the evening ascertained that the rng and guard were of common brass, the former not worth more than a halfpenny, and the latter, perhaps, as much as 3d. or 4d. He tben communicated with the police, who at once recognized the two mon by descriptinn, and the prisoner was apDrohended the same night, but his accomplice got off. On finding that the prosecutoriMeant to give him in charge, the prisoner offered to restore the chain and money. At the first examination 'before the magistrate the prisoner set up a defence, to the effect that he was only a looker on. and that the sale was the act of his companion. But haying, by a slip of the tongue, spoken of the latter as " my mnan," and the involuntary admission having been at onice detected by Mr. HENRY, he made no further attempt to ,defend himself.
On this occasion he was represented by Mr. Lewis, of Mly-place, who submitted that the case was one of constructive larceny, and suggested that his worship should deal with it summarily.
Mr. HENR'.Y was more disposed to consider it as a case of obtaining money under false pretences.
Mr. Lewis would treat the matter as if he was for the prosecution, and had to make out a cape of larceny. If the prisoner, from the beginning of the affair, had the design to possess himself of the property of the prosecutor by fraud, whatever the nature of that fraud-if, in short, the proposition about the cigars and all that followed were part of a plot to get the money and chain from Allen, then it was constructively a theft. Of course, all he now said would go for nothing it the prisoner was committed; but he submitted that in this case the ends of justice would probably be better served by a summary conviction.
Mr. ErmERY would take time to consider the point. in the meanw hile, he must have the evidence of a silversmith as to whether there were any gold at all in the ring and -chain.
M3r. Sayers, silversmith, of Brydges-street, was subsequently examined. The ring was of brass, but had been gilt. The chain was also brass, and not even silt.
lopo-ico 1had fa-le to trc the psoe. scopnn
The police had failed -t-o tr'a-cct'he p-ri'soncr''s"'companion, who, however, is well known by description. There was
no previous conviction against the prisoner.
Ultimately Mr. RI.B-RY decided upon treating the case summarily, and the prisuner, having pleaded "eGuilty" to sthe stealin, was sentenced to four months' imprisonment. His worship re Arked that Alen was not altogether free from blame, as wf le believed thesc articles to be real gold
hie must have su iosed themu to have been in some way dshsonestly obtained to be sold at such a price.
MARYLBSROsL-William 'Vebb, olias Philip Levy, the young man who h-ad undergone twvo previous examninations
bFore Mir. LOmca on tbe charge of having attempted to mnurder lMr. Aklfred Buckler in a carriage on the North london Railway, was again placed at the bar,.and seemed quit an3 indifferent to his serious position ashc did upon the
first and second inquiries.
Mr. LODNG told hiin that, having listened patiently and 4losely to aU the evidene which had been brought before him, it was his duty to send him (prisoser) for trial for the very heinous crime of stabbing the proecutorwith intent to murder hinn. It was not for him (the magistrate) to express an opinion as to guilt or innocence-; verdict in respect thereto would be pronounced in another court, after due consideration, by a jury. The worthy nwigietrate made a few other remarks, evidently under much emotion, in reference to the very serious position in which thmeprisoner ws placed; and
The prisoner, wvho seemed quite unconcerned about the matter, was then remnoved from the bar by Ansted, the gaoler, arnd loked up.
WousHssp.STRXE'T.-John Sweeney, a middle-aged man .of dissipated appearance, was charged before M£r. He,s n.L with the following scandalous outrage:-
,Fhe piswonee9 wife, whose left e pe wan shockiogly on-
tused, and all her features more or lesa dis6gured, stated,-
I have four childreux by the prisoner. who Last night wa;Athome sol'er, lying upon the bed. My children were e
Ixg about the end of the -world, and I was talkng good words to them, my daughter saying that she put her trust in God. when the prisoner sprang frons the bed, and, swearing at me for talking to the children so, struck me with bis fist on the top of the head, and I fell to the ground. He then exclaimed that he did not care for justice, and kicked me about the side, back, and, indeed, all over the body, and continued beating me, from first to hast, from 11 o'clock till about 3 this morning. Re hae beaten me for years, and once knocked my teeth out. I told him last Dight I would go before a magistrate, and he immediately kcked me again, and on my children trying to save me he illused them also.
The son, a boy between 14 and 15, who cried incessautly while giVing his evidence, said,-By mother was talking religion to me and my sister, 'when my father jumlped up, and, calling her scandalous nam es, hit her down with his fit, pulled her about by the hair like a dog, and kicked her all overthe body till she is dreadfully bruised. I interfered, and he chocked me cross the room and broke my nose.
Mr. HA,m, L.-Ts your father often guilty of these Lcts?
Son.-Oh, yes, he is always doing it. A few years ago he knocked her teeth out. My mother works very hard at the clothing for us, and is always talking for our good. My father and mother were both perfectly sober.
PoHleman 129 H.-I was on duty at 3 o'clock this morning, when I beard cries of "Murder" in three different voioes, and on turning my light up to one of the windows I saw a boy and girl, wlho said, *' Oh, for goodness ake, polceman, do come in, for my mother is being killed." I got in, and on going up found the wife bleeding from one of her eyes, the daughter from her cheek, and this boy from the nose. The prisoner threatened to jump his son's inside out, and the wife said she would give him in charge. I told her to reflect, as I knew she would change her mind in a few hours, as she had done before, but the prisoner threatened them sgain, and became so outrageous that I was fearful something very serious would ensue if I did not take him, and I therefore did so. They were both sober.
Prisoner.-She was draunk, beating the children on the floor, when Iinterfered, and she fell against the partition and broke it in. I am a hardworking man for a shilling, and never touched her.
The son was recalled.-My mother did not touch us, and the panel was split through my mother's head going against it when my father struck her.
Constabie.-I examined this partition, and the boy told me the same then.
Mr. RAsM= (to the prisoner).-Of all the very numerous cases of this kind that have come before me I really think that this is the worst. The best thing I can do, it is evident, is to keep away such a monster as you are from this poor woman for as long a time as the law wfil allow me, and I shall therefore sentence you to undergo six months' hard labour in the House of Correction, and at the end of that you must find good bail for another term of like duration.
SouTnvARx.-Caroline Gray and Mary Ann Scofield, two well dressed Lancashire girls, were brought before Mr. COmIE for final examination, charged with stealing a purse containing two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and e6. and 9d. from the person of Eliza Ann Ford.
Air. Solomon appeared for the accused. The prisoners pleaded " Guilty," when
His worship sentenced each of them to six months' hard labour in Wandsworth House of Correetion.
LAsmnri.-George Hlaines was placed at the bar before the Hon. G. C. NORTON on a charge of breaking into the dwelling-house of 3Mr. Richard Bailey, on the night of the 8th of December last, and stealing therefrom 40 sovereigns and a silver watob, the property of the prosecutor.
Froed the evidence, wnich was somewhat lengthy, it
peared that tho prosecutor is a cowkeeer at Norwood and, being uneducated, had been in the habit for eome time of employing the prisoner, who is son to the beadle of the prish to keep his accounts, and make out his biUs, and, being besides on friendly terms, the prisoner spent much of his time at the prosecutor's house. On the night of the 2d of December the prosecutor and his wife were from home, and, on reaching their residence on the following morning, they discovered that their house had been entered, and the property beferementioned carried away. Suspicion at that time attachedto the prisoner, firstfrom the face that the robbery must have been committed bya personwhoknewwhere the money was deposited, and next that it could not have been done by a common thief, as nothing of the valuable property lying about bad been touched. The suspicon received considerable confi-mation from the fact that the hand of the offender must have been bleeding at the time the robbery was committed, as there were marks of blood on the window and drawers, and the prisoner on the morning of the Sthi was found to have a deep cut over the knuckles of his right hand. This he said had been done on the night before, whlle playing at " Gapknife" at Masters's Tavern, but the suspicion attaching to him was so strong that he was requested to attend at the station-house. The officer on duty there did not, however, feel warranted in taking the charge, and allowed him to go at large. The posecutor, however, warned him aainst coming to his
ouse, and also cautioned his wife not to encourage him there. Nothing particular happened between them from that tffe until Thursday last, when Mrs. Bailey left home to accompany a crippled neighbour to St. Bartholomew's Hosuital, and from something that was told the husband respecting the prisoner and her, and of their being both in town, the prosecutor came to town also, and proceeded to the railway terminus at London-bridge. He had not been long there on the look-out when he saw his wife and the prisoner get out of a cab that had just driven Up, both the worse for liquor, and heard his wife say to the prisoner, " Now, my dear, pay the cab," and use other endearing expressions to him, which no one but a person on extremely familiar terms would have used to a stranger. The husband, enraged at this extraordinary conduct on the part of his wife, instantly struck and knockeI her down, upon which the prisoner took her part, and a fight ensued, in the course of which the husband was taken into custody, and transferred to the station, and his wife and the prisoner were left together. In the course of the night, however, both of them presented themselves at the Southwark police-station, where the prosecutor was locked up, and when there the prisoner was locked up also for being drunk, and in the course of the night he made a very determined attempt to hang himself with his neelceloth. While in the company of Mrs. Bailey, and before he was locked up, the prisoner made disclosures to her which led to his being Dut into the dock, and to prove which Mrs. Bailey was puC into the witnessbox. She said that after her husband ad been taken into custody she told the prisoner "she was done for ever;" when he told her " she need not fret, that he would malke her as good a husband as Dick, and quite as comfortable, as he had the -'s money." He also said that while her husband was in prison sho might sell off all his things and go and live with him.
A solicitor who appeared on behalf of the prisoner urged that if the expressions used by the last witness had been spoken by his client it was while under the effects of excessive intoxication; and as for the cut in the hand, he was in a position to show that it had been done at the publichouse on the night before the robbery.
Mr. NORTON observed that this part of the defence cut both ways; for, though he might have cut his hand at the
nublichous&uZst before the robbery, the wound might have
ed at the prosecutor'& The case was one inwhich he should feel,it to be his duty to commit for trial, hut should remban thihe prisoner for a wreek, to give more time to inquire

The Sultana sailing ship left Spithead, with troops for the Cape of Good Hope, on the 11th of NTovember, and arrived out on the 30th of December-49 days ; the Cul. loden, ditto, sailed on the same day, and arrived out on the 5th of January-55 days; the Stamboul sailed on the 15th of November, and arrived at the Cape on the 11th of January-54 days; the Abyssinian sailed from Spithead on the 28th of November, and arrived out on the 25th of January-58 days; whereas the steam troop frigate Vulcan, which left Spithead on the 19th of Novemaber, did not Inake the colony until the 29th of January-71 days I These ships conveyed the British German Legion to the Cape to settle.
The suggestion of "S. G. 0." relatiTe to floating hos. pitals (says our Portsmouth correspondent) is most apt. Theve is one vessel, an old 74 (the Melville), now fitting as a hospital ship professedly for the China station, and another, which was fitted out during the pressure of the late war, and which is now lying in Portsmouth harbour doing nothing (the Britannia three-decker), which might be immediately pressed for the same service. She is now an appendage to the military establishment at Portsmouth.
The officers and men belonging to the British and Indian depOts attached to the ProvisionalBattalion, Chatham, have commenced receiving instruction in escalading along with the troops of the Royal Sappers and Miners, under the direction of Colonel EL Sanudam, commanding the Royal Engineers.

Fatal Fire In Newington.-Last night Mr.
FATAL FIRE iN N wGTON.-Last night Xr. W. Carter, one of the coroners for Surrey, opened an in. quest upon the bodies of Emily Rayner, aged 33, and her rour chidren, aged respectively-Frances, 10 years and a balE; Alice, eight and a half; Susannah, seven; and Harriet, two and a half, who were anfortunately burnt to death in a fire which oczurred on Tuesday night lst at St. Mary's-terrace, Walworth-road. The circumstances of this case are of a peculiarly distresdng character. The ocCUpier of the house, Mr. Rayner, is a commercial traveller in 1a&u. chester goods, and his wife kept a light -i;Inery shop. jOn Tuesday last he left home about 9 o'clock to transact some business, and shortly after he went the shopboy put up the shutters. While doing so he gave an alarm of. fire, and a servant rushed upstairs from the kitchen, and met her raistress going into the parlour. Four of the children were in bed upstairs, and the baby sleeping in the ar_lour. Mrs. Rayner implored the girl to save her baby, which was done, and immediatelyrushed up airs to rescue her otherchildren. By this time the fire, which had broken out in the shop, was fast obtaining the mastery. It was perceived outside, and the spectators immed ately started for the engnes and fireescape, which, however, did not reach the spot until nearly 10 o'clock, by which time the whole house was in a blaze and, as described by one of the witnesses, it was pretty well burnt out. In the midst of the confusion, and while the engines were playing, Mr. Rayner returned home, having beard that his house was on fire. The fire was extinguished after some time, but Mrs. Rayner and four children were burnt to death. Mr. Rayner, who was the first witness examined at the inquest, stated that he had a family of six children, five of whom lived in the house and one wasinthe country. The witness, much affected, proceeded to describe aswellas he could what he sawonhisreturn homeonTuesday night. Hefound that the housewas on fire, the shutters of the shop being quite burnt avay, and the flames coming out of the upper windows. The house had nine rooms and in. cluded three kitchens. It was lighted by gas The stock and furniture were partly insured. William Flynn, of the fire brigade, deposed to the exertions used to extinguish the fire, but said it was impossible to subdue it until two hours had elapsed. The witness sd he did not bear of anyone being in the house when he arrived He proceeded to say that he afterwards found the woman lying on the floor and, close to her a child. He then went to the baek room, and there found another child. The other childrenL wer found in tne room. The child in the back room was upon the Iloor, between the bed and the fireplace. The woman lay on her face burnt very mueh, and the children were burnt still more than the motber.

Theitsual hlf.yearlyCoutof Proprietors of Bank Stock WU held yesterday in the BPank Parlour, but it was not numeroudy attended, Shortly after 12 o'clock the Governor, Mr. T. IL Weguelin, XP., aecompanied by the Deputy.Governor, Mfr. S. Neave, and the other directors entered, ani the proceedings were at once commencedL
The minutes of the former Court having been read by the secretary and confirmed,
The GOVERNoR. ssd,-I halve now to acquaint the Oourt that this is one of the half-yearl° meettings appointed by the 12th bylaw for the making of a dividend. The net profits for the half-year ending the 28th of Febuary last were 686,330W. 2s. 10d., 3mal-i,g the amount of the "rest
on that day 3,719,8;5 lOs. After providing for a dividend of 4. per oent., the "rest" will be 3,064M0?O lOs. The Court of Directors therefore propose that a half-yearlv dividend of interest and profit be made on the 5th of April next at the rate of 43 per cent., without deduction on account of income-tx. (Hear.) The Governor then put the question that a dividend of this amount be declared.
_r. 0. G. BRO%vN remarked that at the 2ame period last year tbe dividend was 5 per cent.; the value of money aince then had advanced, and there must have been an accumulation of profits arising from the increased rate of interest. Was there any reason, then, why the dividend should now be one-half per cent. less than it was in the corresponding period of Ilst year?
The GovxY:NoR-The hon. nroprietor will see that we have carried over 64,970M, which, if he calculates, he will find is only 8,0004 short of as 5 per cent, dividend. (Eear.) The difference of 8,0004 may be accounted for throu-h various circumstances, and the profits consequently are nearly the same this half-year as they were at the similar period last year. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. 1L CLA&B said, it was clear the Court of Directors could not give more than 41 per cent. without evading the rule of ing the-"rest" at 3,000,000& It was not the practice to divide quarter per cents., only halves; and, as they had on the present occasion only nine half per cents., and not ten, they could not make a 10 per cent. dividend. (Hear.)
The GOVEF NOR.-Thatis in reality the case.
The question was then put and carried unanimously.
The GoVzRxso.-I have now to acquaint the Court that the dividend warrants will be delivered and paid on Mionday, the bth of April next.
Mr. THOMPSON.-MAy I be allowed to ask if there is any truth in a report which has been circulated of an intention to allow interest upon deposits ? ([lear, hear.)
The GOVmRxOB.-That report is not correct, and was not authorized by the Court.
Mr. TH0oLPsoN.-One other questior,-Is the West-end branch successful?
The GovERNOR.-The West-ond branch is successful, so far as operations have at present gone.
On the motion, " that this Court shall adjourn,"
Mr. Mi. CLARK pro;osed a vote of thanks to the Governor, the Deputy-Governor, and the Court of Directors for their management. Considering the general courseof affairs, the perilous period through which the publi had passed, the state of the money-market, and the efflux of gold, great caution and decision were requisite in directing the proceedings of this important institution ; and, believing that these duties had been discharged in a most efficient manner, he begged to move that a vote of thanks be carried. (Cheers.)
Mr. BROWN seconded the proposition, and desired to add that, with reference to the 'uestion he had raised concerning the dividend, it was with the view of eliciting information, he being fully satisfied with the management. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. CLARK having put the question, it was immediately agreed to.
TheGovzssoR,in acknowledging the compliment, thanked the proprietors on behalf of himself and bis colleagues for this testimony in favour of the management, and he desired to assure them that the vote was appreciated. (Hear,
M!. Alderman SS.uouoNs suggested that the votes of thanks should be advertised in the morning and evening papers; and a resolution to that effect was proposed and carried.
The Court then separated, the proceedings having oceupied but a very short time.
The Lundhill Colliery Explosion.
THE LUHDHIZZ COLLIERY EXPLOSIoy.
One of the most painful incidents connected with this melancholy accident occurred at the offices of the LundhiU Company on Wednesdayevening last. It having been made known that the engineers wvould meet on that day, and that in all probability orders would he given for imnmediately commencing operations for drawFing off the water, a great number of the widowvs and female relatives of the poor men nfowlycitneg ien tthe pit surrounded the offices in alhngh state of excitement. ~ ~ t
s 7 o'clock the engineers-Messrs. Nicholas, Wood, and lihott, of Newcastle; and Eolt, Wakefield, and Woodhouse, of Derby, met at the offices. The report of Messrs. Web. ster, Maddeson, Coe, and Pearce as to the state of the pit since the meeting on Saturday last was given in. After consulting together for about an hour and a-half the deci. sion of the committee was made known to the proprietors. In consequence, however, of the great anxiety evinced by the assemblage outside MIr. Wood undertook the task of makinp known to them the conclusions they had arrived at.
Mr. WOOD commenced by stating that he had a very painful duty to perform in announcing to them the decision arrived at by himself and the other gentlemen who had undertaken the duty of opening the pit and recovering the bodies of the unfortunate men. They greatly feared that If the pit were prematurely opened they might have to close it again. It had been shown that the temperature of the water in the pit was not uniform, it being 61 degrees at the bottom and 66 at the top, clearly showing that buznin matter still remained in the shaft. They might rest assured that not a minute's time should be lost in getting the bodies out as soon as the pit was in a state to warrant them drLawing the water of. All of them, including the owners, were desirous of doing everything they could to facilitate that operation. The engineers had fixed upon a height which the water should rise before drawing off, and such height they were of opinion would be attained on Monday next, when, as everything was ready, he believed that they Would commence the task of getting out the water and reaching the bodies. Every one must deeply sympathize with them in their anxiety to recover the bodies of those belonging to them. In conclusion he hoped that the Almighty would support them in their great affiction.
The announcement that the emptying of the pit was put off to Monday nzext was received with loud lamentations, the women and children appearing almost overpowered with emotion. The scene was altogether of the most harrowing description, the agonizing cries of the poor women being painful in tbe extreme.
The Government Inspector said that he quite agreed with the decision the committee had come to, for sould the pit be opened, and any of the burning matter remained unquenched, the accumulated gas coming in contact with it might cause such an explosion as would not only greatly endanger the lives of those gallant men who had undertaken the onerous task of searching for the bodies, but probably be the means of entirely closing the pits. The mansmumn height which the engineers were of opinion should be reached before there rwas a certainty of
here being put out was 60 feet. As the water had lready reached 47 feet that height would doubtless be attained by Monday.__

THE CAMP AT COLCHESTER.-The wretched con-
THE CAMP AT COLcMU STExc-The wretched condition of the soldiers' wives at the Colchsster camp has led to some correspondence between the War Department and Major-General Gascoigne, which was published yesterday. It appears that in the middle of last month the scenes of destitution as to the wives and children of soldierr
inochester, from causes connected w;ith the army regnltations and the dearness of food, were truly deplorable. and "there wvere not so fewv as 250 wives and ~350 children next to houseless." The wvives of soldiers married withont the commanding officer's leave and who had no chileren received 2d., and many only a penny a-day to live cu, and it was feared that they would fall into habits of prostitution. TheSecretary of State for War wrote to Maor*.eneral Gascoigne on the 2d inst. to the effect that he (Lord Panmure) could not sanction the application to the cases of those women wvho bad married soldiers without the content of the commanding offioer of the Circular No. 1,235 (July 15, 1856, inasmuch as it contemplated the cmes of women who had been left behind at the stations at which their husbands were serving previous to their removal to a (amp, and not to women above the regulated number who helongto corps situatedasthadepdteat Colchesterare. Lord Panmure, however, agreed to grant free paages or travel. ling expenges back to their par.shes to the wives and famin
3ies of soldiers who had married without conset, or whose wives wece in excessof the regulated numbes provided they were willing to return. Lord Panmure at the same timeexpressed his surprise that soldiers who h#A mlarred vithout consent, and whose wives and families hd been allowed to accompany thera from Ireland to Colhesger, had beenplacedunderstoppage of paT to refund the XPse of

Sir,-I have often thought of a brief remark which is found curiously embedded in the midst of many profound reflections in Pascw4 "Di:scur dc bons mots, mauvais caacferc." I do not wish to apply the remark, thougb, doubt less, the result of much observation and experience, to your correspondent from "Broad Phylacteries;" but I do not envy the tone and temper of mind which, for the sake of exciting a momentary laugh, would wound the feelings of tho truly good man who pre3ides over the Church of England. Is it nothing to the sneerer that we can point to one who, placed in the highest gtation, is " clothed with humility?' Is it nothing that we can confidently say that in the poorest parsonage of this country you would seek in vain for one more meek and lowly-more simple in his ha bits and deportment-more thoroughly exempliying the mild graces and virtues of a Christian pastor, than the prelate who occupies the Palace of Lambeth ? I believe, Sir, that tho Archbishop's mind is still in its ful and unimpaired vig our, but, even if it weri not so, whst is the subject of your correspondents ungenerous ridicule? It is that the faithful follower of his Divine Master, even when his physical powers have no, escaped the sad penalty of advancing years, is still anxious to devote the hst remnants of his strength to the advocacy of Christian truth and Christian charity. If this be a fault, it Is at leat a fault " cxccssu amore DcO" We all know that " the disciple whom Jesus loved" was carried in his days of feebleness and decline into the church over which he had presided, and in which he was wont to utter his favourite precept of matual affection. We do not hear that any one was found to make a mock of the decays of nature, and to draw invidious contrasts between the failing efforts of an aged minister and the powerful oratory of a young aukd popular preacher. There was then, doubtless, a voice which repeated tho affecting admonition of the Son of Sirach,-" Despise him not when thou art in thy full strength. . . In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered."
Your correspondent is a great admirer of eloquence, and willing to listen to it from what quarter soever it may come. Perhaps, therefore, he will allow me to recommend to him, when the mirth which now enlivens " Broad Phylacteries" has a little subsided, to reflect on the feelings which prompted and on the feelings which are appealed to in the words with which the great Bossuet closes the noblest of perorations --" Henreux si, averti par ces cheveux blancs de compte que je dois rendre de mon administration, je reserve au troupeau quo jo dois nourrir de la parole de vie les restes d'un voix qui tombe et d'une ardeur qui s'eteint."

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Without entering into the question of extraecolesial preachers in our cathedrals I do hope that which has been raised in your columns will open the way t) greater freedom in this respect. About 17 years ago I served, as curate, an outlaying hamlet of Wells. Returning from the Sunday duty, I had to pass through part of the city which, from the neglected condition of its inhabitazts, was called " Turkey." I offered to give an evening service in the nave of the cathedral for those poor people who dwelt within its shadow, provided lights and benches were supplied. The Rev. James TAw, then " special commissary" for his father, the aged Bishop, immediately offered 901. towards it, but the Dean and Chapter would not consent-" red tapeism" stood in the way. I rejoice to hear that a church is now being erected for these people by the vddow of the late Dean. Butwhyshouldnot those noble stona puloits, such as are in the transept of Bristol Cathedral (the nave of which is demolished) and in the nave of Wells Cathedral, be regularly nsed? Why should that at Wells belie the inscription round it, "Preach the word; be instant in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine?' Why should screens of solid masonry shut the " naves" out from tho " choirs r"

TO TEE EDITOR, OF TEE TIS.
Sir,-As a smal pendant to the comparison from tho Broad Phylactery, Westminster allow me to state that I this morning received a lithographed programme of a series of " sermons in MS, lithography, composed and written by a clergyman of long experience as a writer." It was accomprnied by a lithographed request for patronage from my " faithful ervant, , Vwho shall be nameless. This dispenser of spiritual treasures ajppears to have a large heart, as he is prepared to sympathize upon the shortest notioo from a second floor in EHolboru with almost every hopeful phase of both the inner and outer life of my remote oountry paTish. Indeed, I am not sre that his charity has even yet found a limit. He has already practically endorsed the ndependence felt in my infant school of certain narrow conventionalities about initials, punctuation, and spelling.

A story of "$domestic interest5" spreading ovei a perIe! ef ten years, and divided into four acts, was la 2aighl brought out with the tie A Life's *fl The aisthot LI. Mr. Bayle Bernard, who ae #as tu , original.
The personages wlhose progresm occuplee the decenfiun:, extending from 1825 to 1835 may be. divided Into two. claes-the serious and the oomic; and, though theydonot so far participate in the nature of prlel lines ags nevet t
meet at all, their appearanoes is a great deal regulated br that alternate principle which prior to the Gallic invasot predoniinated on the English stge A bit of rentimeant then a bit of " fun," then atutinent again-such wus t good old British notion of symmetry.
The serious interest centres in Carolire Bochdale (Miwf Reynolds), a young lady resident in Wales, who, though :hct is a model of charity and benevolence, is exposed to w lengthened series of maisfortunes. She is engaged to - young West Indian gentlemau named Wyndham (Ir. We Farren), but she is also beloved by Wyndham's fdas flenS Hawksworth (Mr. Howe), who resolves to gain her at all riss Accordingly, he intercepts a remittance on whicla the betrothed youth depends for immediate subeistencea and persuades him to leave the country, while he also shows himisef such a friend to the fther of the yomng lady, whos
bank at Carmarthen has just broken in the panic of X2, thab she cannot do otherwiso than give him her hand in spite og strong internal dislike. Of course the marriage does not turn out happily. After a lapse of three years we find that.- Hawlksworth has taken to gaming, and has also committeZ a forgery, to escape the consequenoes of which he s ^boutto 6ail for America. Wyndham, who has returned fronzr the West Indies in a state of high prosperity, is zath, rally indignant when he hears that Caroline has matrieX Hawksworth ; but, learning likewi3e that she is on the Terge, of destitution, he pays her a visit with the most benevolent - intentions. Unlucldly, Hawksworth, though he has set off, unknown to his wife, returns for some missing artile, and thus the rivals are brought face to face, each looking: daggers at the otlher, the husband displaying aUI,e cool.. ness of deliberate malice, and the supplanted lover all the frankness of generous rage. A duel is fought on the spot,
and as Hawksworth's pistol misses fire bis life Is at;the mercy of his adversary. A cry, however, is raised that the officers ef justice are in pursuibof the forger, and Wyndliamassists him to escape. 'Let patnaot bre supposedd that any forgiveness of injuaes takes
cannot endure partners in his Tengeance; and llawkswortlx only accepts the proffered aid on the understanding thati another hostile meeting is to take place on somle futunr
When seven years have elapsed poor Mrs. IavwkswortTK bas, apparently, a chance of happines. Some mines that, ruined her father have turned out so prosperous that shet is enabled to live in opulence at a snug little villa, at Richmond, her worthless husband is reportel dead, and accident has renewed her acquaintance with thelover of her youth. Thus is fortune hountiful both ir. what she gives and in wlat she takes away Forgetting their past troubles, Wyndhan and CaroMe ares abott to be married, when a dark cloud appears on the hori. zon. This dark clond is, of course, Hawksworth, come back in rags from Amnerica. Conjugal duty restrains the wife from handing him over to the police, and she is obliged to grant him an allowance to make him conceal his position.
Isguig him6elf so effectally that all traces of his former sel are lost, he drags W,tndham into a gambling-housec and completely 'pigeons him. Such, as he explains
lifingnp his green spectacles, and revealing his .ace), isis vengeance; he has not aimed at tho life but at the wealth of his early rival, and this he clutohes in the shape of a pocket-book, weighty with bank-notes. However, at the moment of triumph the police enter ths gaming-honse, at the instigation of Mrs. Hawk-swortb, ana as the forger is recogized,he has no resource but to swal. low a poisoned pil w ch he carries in his waistcoat pocket, leaving his widov a prospect of happiness with a second: husband. The effect of the poison as rather more potent than had been intended, for the audience, who had takex
considerable interest in the progress of the story, were marveRously displeased at this inartiicial manner of cutting the Gordian knot, and several hisses acoompanied by the explanatory words "Bad finishI" followed the descent of the curtain, applause being but moderate.. This catastrophe was the less to be expected, as the second and third acts ha M terminated amid loud plaudits, and Mr. W. Farren, for his spirited exhibition of rage in ono of the "strong situations," had been called before the curtain,
The comic personages consist of M1r. Montague Spicerz (Mr. Buckstone), a grocer, who ruins himsell by aping fashionable manners; his sensible wife (3Mrs. B. Fitzwlliam), and Captain Tatters (M1r. Compton), an ad. venturer. In the course of the 10 years mir. S icor sinks into a state of mendicity, but, being raised there. from by the kindly hand of Mrs. Hawksworth, nltimately returns to honourable grocery. The Captain also goes3 through a series of dodges for a livelihood, but settles at; last as a respectable teacher of calisthenics. There is a great deal of fun in the dialogue of this comic portion of thew piece, which must be pronounced free from all sharein: causing the less amicable expressions that were uttered at the conclusion of the whole.
By the decorations much is done in giving reality to the generaloeffect. The streetin theoBorough, with the Town. hal as the principal object, the old yard of the " George
Inn,'and(lray's.inn-passg will come as old friends ta every true-horn Londoner; the beach ofTenby and ther Thames from Richmond are excellent specimens of stspee landscape, and for a brilliantly furnished and lighted
terser we have the west-end club or gaming-house. Thqartists are Mbessrs. Callcott, O'Connor, and Morris,
