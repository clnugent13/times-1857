MONBY-MAKRETandOITY IRTBLLIGBNOB. Tuesday Evening. The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per rmille premiiun, and the short exchange on London if 23S22J per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English MIint price of 31. 17s. 104d. per ounce fcr standard gold it appears that gold is nearly 3-10ths per cent. dearer in Paris than In Londoa. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 423i per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13-41 per 17. sterling. Standard gold at the Engllih Mint price is therefore at about the same price in LLondon and Hamburg. The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is variously quoted at from par up to 105 per cent., the latter being for first-class paper only. There is, consequently, at present an advantage in sending gold from this country as compared with drawing bills from America. The public continue to support the ftnds by investing largely, and there has been a recovery today of a half per cent. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 88, were first quoted 88 to . For some tinme they remained with an unsettled appearance, but ultimately the numerous purchases exercised a strong influence, and an advance took place to 88i, which was fairly supported to the close, the last official transactions being at 88a to i for money, and 88,* for the 10th of November. After reguiar hours the disposition to firmness was maintained, and the quotation for the account was 88§ to ;. In the early part of the day the rate for loans on Government eecurities was 54 per cent., but in the afternooni large sums were obtainable with ease at 5 per cent. At the Bank the applications were comparatively moderate, and in the discount-market choice paper was negotiated slightly below the Bank mfLimvrm of 8 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 87T to I; New Three per Cents., 87i to i; India Stock, 207 to 210; and India Bonds, 30S. to 20s. discount. The increase in the Bank rate has led to some sales of Exchequer-bilLq, and the price has receded to los. to 10s. discount. The Bank of France have to-day raised their rate of discount from 6.W per cent., at which it was fixed on the 13th inst., tio 7I per cent. Although a rate fio high has not previously been experienced in France, the limit until the recent modification of the charter of the Bank having beea 6 per cent., the movement does not appear to have created any additional uneasiness on the Bourse. The foreign stock-market has been quiet, with a tendency to advance. In Turkish there was a recovery of about 1 per cent. A transaction was marked in Swvedish; but, notwithstanding the announcement of the new loan, it showed no alteration from the previous rate. Brazilian Flve per Cents. were negotiated at 98S; Danish Three per Cents., 84; Mexican, 190 ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, '7; Ruissian Five per Cents., 106; Spanish, for the account, 40-; Swedish, 83; Turkish Six per Cents., for the, account, 874, i, and i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 98; for the account, 94 J; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 631 ; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, in the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates for Paris were higher than last post; the only other important alteration was a considerable advance ina the cases of Yienna and Trieste. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 66f. 7Oc. for both rmoney and account, showing a decline of only an eighth. The Heatherbell has arrived from Melbourne with 10,647 ounces of gold, valued at 78,5881. About 68,(001. of Australian gold was sold to the Bank to-day. It is said that about 40,000 sove. reigns brought by the late arrivals have also been paid in there. An impression has prevailed in some quarters that the Arago, which sails from Southampton for New York to-morrow, would take out about 200,0001. in gold. Up to this evening the total engaged to be sent was 4,600 sovereigns It is understood, however, that a further parcel will be despatched from London early to-morrow morning. The rate of discount at Hamburg has advanced to 90 per cent. Lotters frorm Milan to-day announce the suspension of the respectable bankiDg firm of Balabio and Co., of that city. It had been in difficulties for some time. Each day now f rishes to the financial world an illustration of the way in which they s3trive for distant facilities and neglect those at their door. If the Atlantic telegraph were in operation, what would be the first messages sought ? The state of the bullion in the banks on both sides. But as regards the Bank of England, we have the power to get the information, and permit it to be keptback until, practically, it is useless. All the calculations of our merchants and manufaoturers should be made with reference to the probable movements of the money-market, yet it is only after a lapse of seven days that they become acquainted with each return of the Bank of Eng. land on which those movements depend. While every effort is made to develope at any cost the system of instantaneous communication through all regions of the globe, a knowledge of the few figures upon which more than anything else our commercial judgments should be formed is allowved week by week to be withheld, although the very object of providing for their publication was that they nwight serve as the speedieat signals to check all iinprudeat action. But, objectionable and ridiculous as the case thus appears, it does not end here. Although the governors and directors as a body use efforts to prevent those figures which they withhold from the public from tranispiring for the benefit of individual speculators, it is notorious that absolute secrecy is not preserved. Even if there could be any plea for the concealment they profess to regard as desirable, it would thus be cut away. Indeed, In proportion as they assert the necessity for it they condemn their own laxity, which renders it unattainable. The management of the Bank during the last six or seven years has been in all essential respects so sound and so honourable to the country that it is disagreeable to have to enlarge upon the disregard of the interests and just rights of the commercial community manifested on this point. Some months back, when public attention was greatly aroused to it, there was a belief that arrangements would be made to enable the publication cf the returns to take place in the (Gazette of Tuesday instead of Saturday, or, at all events, that they should be publicly posted at the Bank on the morniing of Wednesday. The intention, however, seems to hale been allowed to drop. It is to be hoped it still exists, and that the delay in its fnlihnent has been but accidentaL. According to the circular of M. Arles Dufour, of Lyons, the advices from the United States have greatly aggravated the depression in the silk-market, owing to the belief that the consumption on that side must be small for many months. Opinions are greatly divided as to the future course of prices, I some persons anticipating a further heavy fall, while others, owing to the extent of that which has aready taken place, are disposed to rely upon a reaction. The following mercantile communication by the Brazil mail gives the latest details of financial and commercial prospects in the River Plate. An important reciprocity treaty appears to be contemplated between Brazil and Montevideo. With regard to Buenos Ayreo the satisfactory ancd novel statement is made that the Government is in honest hands:- " Montevideo, Sept. 4, "Everybody is br,sy about the elections, which are to coern off on the 29th of November. The Blancos are using the most strenuous efforts to secure the majority; but even if they succeed it is not certain that Oribe will be acknowledged as their undisputed head. There Is only a portion of the Plaiico party that can be considered as his out-and-out partisans. Had our President been the man he once was, I and as at his election it was fondly anticlpated he continued to be, these struggles would have almost terninated. It is expected that the next picket will bring us a new treaty from Rio de o aneiro of a nature that will be highly favourable to both this country and ultimately Brazil; but it is doubtful if it can be carrfed out. Neither England, France, nor the United States are likely to looL on in silence. If I am correctly informed, the produce of Montevideo is to be admitted into Brazil free of all duties, and in like manner the produce of the empire is to be admitted into the Uruguay Republic. As, unless it is jerked beef, we cau send nothing of importance to Brazil, while we receive sugar, coffee, rum, rice, tobacco, yerba, and many other articles, which pay a high duty, the reciprocity would be evidently one- Eided. To compensate this country for Its apparent sacrifices, Brazil is to advance on loan, at an interest of 6 per cent. per annum, 3,000,000 duros, whioh are to be devoted to the sinking of all military pensions aud half-pay, so that the country may be relieved of the incubus that paralyzes all progress. Neither France nor England sends the artioles enumerated, and, probably, wheat is the only article that would affect the United States; but It is a question If either of those countries will silently submit to a preference which in fact is only nominal. Should this tre7ty be carried out the revenue of this republic would for two or three years be ser'ously diminished, and as the guaranteed bondholders accepted the arrangemeSt in progress on thesupposition that the presert Customus' duties would not be seilously reduced, tbgy will have a fair claim, through the Foreign-office, for compersation. Iadeed I do not see how our Government could sanction so positive an infraction of their contract, for the contract is of their making. There is now a dispute between the Montevidean Government and Her Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires respecting the conditions of the contract. The formner is exhibiting another proof of want of all good faitb and con,mon honesty. I is to be hoped Mr. Thornton uill not give ia, and that he will be tboroughly supp'trhd by Lerd Clarendon. The claim of Mr. &onnioulhou, vibich was recognized the beginningof lastyear, and on which soanie onthly instalaients were paid and then sale cnded, has been approved by both Chambers; consequently the Government has felt itself compelled to resumue paynient. I should have informed you in my last that tbis Government has at length agreed to the appointmuent of B,itish and French commissioners to arrange, in conjunction vith national comimissioners, the amount and maode of i ettlement of British and French claims arising out of losses during theinvasion. It is to be hoped that claims justly chargeable against the Government of Buenos Ayres will not be saddled upon this poor country, particularly as many of those clainis arose from the miserable policy of the inrjpean Governments. The oommis8ioners should be sent from .Eglnad and France, and they sbould be men of great firmane,s of character. Neither Mr. Thornton nor M. Mallifer, wvho represent those Governments here, should be intrustel withthis business, for, although highly respected, they hava other matters to atteDd to. Mana's bank of issue has now been in operation for a month, and to judge from the papers it does not give z,uch satisfaction. No large notes remain in circulation, and, probably, not more than 5,0001. valae of smnall notes is out. The rate of discount is 15 per cent., and theallowancoof interest ondeposits is 10 per cent. The French project known here as Zienek's Bank finds more favomr with the public than formerly. The renewed privileges gohome by this packet, and the last chance is afforded to the French capitalists to establish a hank here, which could not faU to produce large profits, particularly if tho emigration scheme were added to it. The streets are now somewhat cleansed, and we have almost forgotten the fever ever visited us Exchlange, 43id. "Buenos Ayree never was so well governed as now, The nmin in power are honest, and it may be hoped the people will appreciate a virtue so rare mitnong those who aspire to govern in these countries. The inundations have carried off multitudes of sheep, and It is expected the present year's crop of wool will not exceed that of last year. While Buenos Ayres continues to progress In prosperity the Argentine Confederation appears to be getting into debt. Urquiza is not the man wanted for the occasion. Re in too pe-sonal in State matters. As Governor of Entre Rios, he prohibits the exportation of sheep, and exercises many other arbitrary acts. At present he is at loggerheads with ParanLay, and there is a talk of war between that Republic and srazil, v'hich, however, it is hoped may be averted." The Mooniteur of yesterday announces that the Austrian Lloyds have opened two new lines of steamers-one from Trieste to Malta, calling at Ancona, Molfetta, Brindisi, Corfu, and Messmia; the other fromn Trieste to Barcelona, calling at Bar, MeSBina, Palermo or Catania, Leghorn, and Mar- seilles. The dates of a-rival and departure are not yet fully determined upon.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. TuesdAy Evening.

London and South-Western improved 21., being now about I1. higher than the closing price of Saturday. East India shares are without alteration. Canadian have genera]ly rallied.

STATE OF TRADE. MANCCERSTEB, Ocr. 20. The market has been exceedingly dull and depressed. The feeling has been something akin to a panic. In yarns no concession would tempt buyers to operate, the difficulty being, not a question of prices but of means and a want of confidence. Xf the Bank had not farther raised discoumts probably some business would have been done, as a better feeling than prevalled last week was gaining ground, but this measuro has created an exceedinply uneasy feeling, and no business has been done worthy of mention either for home-consumption or export. Buyers eaunot operate be- I cause their paper is not discountable. Sellers of cloth make no quotable change in their terms, but practically the market is easier, if there was business. On domestics 1-16d. to Rd. per yard, and on longcloths and T-cloths lAd. to 3d. per piece, would have probably been conceded from the bigheet point in sorne cases to effect sales, and there has been more desire manifested to take orders for these goods than of late. The offers, however, have not been of a character to test values. Very little business has been effected in any kind of cloth. Turkey red cloths and jaconots have been neglected. A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Auld and Bachanran, calico printers, having establishments here and in Glasgow, is to be held this evening. The liabiities are said to bs 75,0001., and the estate wSl realie, it is expoeted, 13s. in the pound. About 11,0001. to 12,0001. are owing to Man Chester houses, and the remainder chiefly in GlasgowA small cloth agency house in Manchester, owing30,0001., Is said to be in difficulties, and a small buying agency house is also reported to have suspended paymente.

The tone of the market this morning was flatter than has been observed for some time, and scarcely any business was trausacted. Thero is ver;' little doing in the home trade, and it is not likely there will be much improvement unti we have a change of weather, for at present it is more lke spring than the close of autumn, tlie atmosphere being warm and genial. The retail dealers can do nothing in heavy goods, which are at presernt almost a drug upon their hands, and until the winter sets in more in earnest the consumption is likely to continue very much below the supply. No doutbt there are a variety of causes contributing to the want of activity manifested, and the rise in the Bank of England discount has not been without its effect. RIUDDERSFIELD, Ocr. 20. The market has been very quiet this morning, the state of the American trade, the rate of discount, and the price of the raw material all combining to check operations. There was very little done excepting in low goods. Devonshires wero inquired after, and there were a few transactions in drabs. Wools do not advance, but are firm. The next sales are fixed for Thursday, the 12th of November, though tho quantity at present in hand is only 33,054 bales, but it will, no doubt, be largoly increased before the sales.

Bridgend, was severely cut above the eye, with bruises on the face and other injuries.
RAILWA Y INTELLrGENCE. GRANTh TRTT'm ai n( NA nATAThA The adjourned annual meeting of this company was held on September 29th at Toronto, the Hon. J. Ross inathe chair. Mlr.GnseNr, the assistant-secretary, read the report, wlhich stated that the primary object of the directors ad been to open the line for local traffic as the sections were finished, as they condAdered this accommodation due to the peoplo of the province after the aid extended to the company by tho Legislature. Motives of prudence also rendered it good policy to do so, and every season's experience would indicate what requisites were necessary to secure the legitimate Ehare of the enormous goods traffic passng from cast to west at the varioas intercepting points on the lake as well as on the river. The success attending the Canadian mail steamers had acquired for them a prestige which has established the St. IAwrence and the Grand Trunk route as the shortest and quickest to the Western and South-Western States. When the Grand Trunk Railwvay is finished Quebec, Portland, Montreal, Xircston, Toronto, Hamilton, London, Detroit, Sarnia Colllgwood, l1eterboro', and Ottawa, will be connected by railway without a break, and as a commercial enterprise the directors feel confident that it will ultimately fulfil all the expectationswhich have been entertained of it. With regard to that portion below Quebec which forms part of the colonial cbain of railroad originally contemplated, the directors entertain the most sanguine hopes, confidently believing that no lengthened period can elapse before the New Brunswick Government will bave run its road to the frontier, and one unbroken line of communication will have been eflected between the western waters of L3ake Huron and the south-eastern extremity of Nova Scotia. w w to th trictions contained in the Relief Act of Ic6 wiitb respect to the application of the preference bonds for 2,000,0001. to meet existing liabiities, and for additional rolling Etock, station, arnd other accommodation, it is necessary to obtain the sanction of the shareholders. It is only Intended to issue an amount not exceeding 1,500,0001., the balance of 500,0001. being intended to be In substitution of the C debentures created last year, and which wil be cancelled. The directors recommend that these debentures rank immediately after the existing debentures of the company, and bear interest at the rate of 7 per eent. per annum, and that one-third be repayable in five years, one-third in 10 years, and one-third in 16 years. In 1856 an independent cozpiany obtained an Act for the construction of a railway from the' Grand Trunk line at St.Mary's, a point nine miles west of Stratford, to London, a distance of 22 miles, and it ws considered desirable that the sanction of the shareholders should be givers to the amalgamnation of the two companies at par, and to an agteement which has been made, for the construction and equipment of the railway, with responsidle Canadian contractors, at a cost of 8,0001., per mile, including roling stock, and which is included In the sum available under the Relief Act of 1856. The report of Air. S. P. Bidder stated that since the date of the last zeport no additional mileage has been opened, and the shareholders will bear in mind that the llne still remains in unconnected sections, a fact which fully accounts for the business of the road being almost altogether of a local character. Oat of a total of 663,028 passengers 555,012 were local; and out of 355,221 tons of freight 316,599 tons were also local. The links now wanting in the malIn chain of communiation fzom west to east are the esplanade in front of the city of Toronto, the lengths betwveen Stratford and London, Stratford and Sarnia, the extension east of St. Thomas's, and the Victoria-bridge, all of which are now being pushed forward with the utmost vigour. The total length of railway now open is 849 miles. The total receipts for the past half-year have been 289,4691., and the expenditure 284,6881. currency, leaving a balan,ce of 4,780& to the credit of revenue. The expenses would have been n uch less were it not for the very large outlay necessitated by extraordinary repairs on the leased lines from Montreal to Portland, in the reroling and relaying of lengthy sections of rails, and in the entire renewal of bridges, which renewals are still going on, and will require nearly 50,000 to complete them. During the past few mnonths 30,0001. has been expended in renewals of stations, bridges, and rails. The working expenses would not have exeeeded the estimate of IO, per mile per week(suffident to earn201.permiUeperweek), butforthese extraordlnary repairs, The sum of 31,0001, of thatextraordinaryexpen- u in the opinion of Mtr. Bidder, to be charged to capitaL He states that the emigration arriving at Quebec has received, during the past year, his especial attention, and that the through-booking arrangements,as completed by Sir Cusack Roney, in England, have been productive of the most beneficial results as regards the comfort and expedition with which emigrants have been conveyed to their places of destination after their arrival in the St. Lawrence. The number who have availed themselves of through tickets has been nearly one-third of the total numiber of emigrants who have arrived, and over 100,000 books, maps, and general information circulars with reference to Cardad as a home for the emigrant, have been gratuitously circulated from the London office of the company. Mr. A. x Boss, the englneer, stated in his report, dated the 22d of September, on the VIctorla-brIdge, that by the 12th of November lst year the two abatments and nine piers were oornpleted, tho dams for seven additional piers were commenced early In the sasson of the present year, two of these piers have been completed, the masonry of two more is in a forward state, and the masonry in the other three damns had been commenced and would be completed by the middle of November, makdng 16 piers completed out of 25. The Iron work for one tube was now la course of erection, and would be finished by the 1st of November. On the motion for the adoptlon of the report some discussion ensued in respect to the proposed amalgamation of the Grand Trunk Junction Company at par with the Grand Trunk Company, the length of the Junction line being 2P miles and the cost 176,000=. Resolutions were passed, adopting the report, electing .). T. G.

STATISTICS OF ALGERIA.-It appears from (Englisb) official returns that in 1855 the number of " civil Europeans," or rather Enropean civilians, in the French province of Algeria amounted to 155,G07 (to which number it had risen from 112,743 in 1849), and that there were 143,387 Europeans resident there in I834M, of whom 79, 577 were French, 6,279 Anglo-Maltese, 39,339 Spaniards, S,L3S Italians, 5,SS7 Germans, 1,910 Swiss, and 2,251 not specified. The French Algerian army in 1853 (the last year given) numbered 70,496 men, and in 1849 it nnmbered ,7o,000. It appears that the native population of the colony In the districts under military government amonnted in 1854 to 2,056,298 souls-viz., 625,296 men, 630,800 women, and 800,202 children. ln the districts " occupied by Europeans there were in 1854 143,387 Europeans (as already shown), and 105,860 natives, thus making a total of 249,252 souls. The ttal amount of Cmntows and navigation dues received Un Alger in 1854 was 2,552,769f., or 102,1111.-viz., 1,937,647f. frorn import due 329f. f-om export dues, 217,896f. from " other Cnstoms' receipts," and 396,Sudf. fromn navigation dues. There entered inwards at ports in Algeria, in 1S54, 6,817 vessels, of 437,912 tons; and there cleared outwards 6,703 vessels, of 428,240 tons. These include the vesseis engaged in the Algerlan coasting trade. 119 British shins entered inwards at Algerian ports, in 1854. The value of the imports int) Algera in 1854 was 81,234,447f., or 3,249,3781. ; and that of the exports 42,176,068f., or 1,687,0431. The inpDor's from Franoe alone are valued at 6, 902,294f.

The imports from all other conrtries were under 1,000,000f. The staple exports from the colony app to be skins, wool, coral, wheat and barley, flour, pule, tobacco, olive oil, and lead. These are the chief according to the valne enumerated), but the list is a long one. The land oultivated for grain in Algeria includes 761,470 heetares, or 1,903,675 acres; the average produce of soft wheat in 1854 was 11163 hectolitres per hectare, and of hard wheat 101o5 hectolitres per hectare; and the total produce of soft and hard wheat was respectively 207,0S2 and 5,054,275 hectolitres.

SUPPOSED OCUCSSIAG -SND ROBBERY.-On Saturday night, at a late hour, the police constable on duty in Drurumond-street, near the Euston-sqiiare terminus, discovered lying upon the pavement an elderly, well-dressed man In a perfect stato of insensibility, and frothing much at the mouth. He was removed to the University College Hospital, but notwithstanding all that was done he rapidly sank and died on Sanday. But previous to his death the deceased recovered a little consciousness, and with great difficulty it was elicited from him that he had only been in London a few days, in which he was a stranger pre, viously; that his name was Edward Ashton, carrying on business as a woollen factor at Leeds, in which town ha had a wife and family. It was ascertained beyond a doubt that the deceased's lnsensibility was produced by excessive drinklug, or that possibly he had been drugged. He died under the symptoms of ddirisom bvrncns. the fact of his being wvell dressed, but with no watch, money, or other property about his person wFhen discovered, would lead to the Imapression that he had been robbed. The police authorities at Leeds have been communmeated with, Au inquest will be held to-morrow,
LONDON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1857. After the immense amount of humanity that has been done at home, particularly towards murderers and other atrocious criminals, it may seem a new phase of the British character to find a general consent in favour of strong measures in the East. This, indeed, is rather understating the case, for the consent is the greatest for the strongest measures, and there are few people who would not think a simple extermination of the Sepoys on the field of battle rather a tame conclusion of the affair. To the few who in these times can sit still in their armchairs and calmly criticize these excesses of indignation EDgland must, of course, seem quite beside herself, or, what is worse, very hollow and inconsistent in her philanthropy. Tried at last, really touched in her pride, she flares up, they will say, like the most natural, unsophistical savage, and thirsts for revenge of the grossest sort,-revenge in kind, revenge in blood and fire, by the ignominious halter, the horrid cannon, the murderous bullet, or the cold steel. We perceive a sort of triumph over England, with all her progressive religion, with her mild toleration, her almost bloodless penal code, and her reformatory system. Is it not straining at a gnat and swallowinug a camel when ten or twenty thousand people petition HER MAJESTY to let off some fellow who murdered his wife, simply because he did not want to be plagued with a woman he no longer cared for, and everybody-ladies and gentlem n, preachers of all persuasions, and speakers of all platfotms, every tongue, every pen-demands the deEtruction of 70,000 Sepoys? Criticisms of this sc.rF, however, proceed on a very wrong idea, not enly of the British race, but still more of humanity. This virtue is not the general principle of sparing life, or of indulgence towards all sorts of crimes. Like other virtues, it goes into certain babits, is regulated by circumatances, and observes conditions. We are humane to the weak and wretched; to those of whom there is still hope, and whose actions may possibly belie their intentions. We are not humane to those who betray a deep-seated depravity; to the treacherous ; to those who practile any refinement of cruelty. During the last tbirty years we have had murderers who, with all our philanthropy, did not obtain one voice, that we remember, to ask for their livec. The whole nation joined to execrate the man wbo Atcod behind a door for an hour, with a dumb-bell in bis hand, to strike down his par. ticular friend, and, failing that, took him a trip into the country, and finished him on the road: it execrated the man who, with a grievance of some scrt to bear him out, burst into a house, and, with sufficient courage, shot down husband, wife, son, and maid: it execrated the trusted valet who slew his master in bed for his money and trinkets: it execrated the man who supplied the surgeons with subjects from the streets of Edinburgh, and the man who cut up the victims; and, more recently, the man who discharged with proper doses of poison all his gambling debts and domestic duties. No doubt, our indignation might be more consistent, and we are not standing up for the absolute consistency of our benevolence and forgiveness; but it is a niistake to suppose that Englishmen are humane in cases where humanity would be wasted, and where the offenders are, in fact, out of the pale of humanity. This applies, it may be said, to the actual offenders, or the abettors and accomplices in these borrid scenes; but not to the whole of the mutiness. We beg leave, however, to say that it does. It applies to the mutineers in the peneral, and to every individual of them, unless he have proved himself an exception. As a general rule, whenever the mutineers have had the power they have murderecd our women and children. In some casea, which we trust wM receive every possible consideration, parties of the Insurgents, or individual Sepoys, or native servants, warned the Europeans, and at the risk and even cost of their own lives led men, women, and children to a place of safety. They did this, they say, because they knew the certain fate of men, women, and children, if they should fall into the hands of the general body. If, in some cases, the whole regiment sent off their officers and their families unharmed, that was contrary to orders, for the instructions from the head-quarters of the conspiracy, as proved by letters intercepted all over India, were to destroy, with the Sahib, his wife and children. In general, at the time of each successive act of mutiny it was known how the women and children had been treated elsewhere. The massacres of Delhi, Jhansi, Cawnpore, with all their atrocities, were matters of notoriety before the bulk of the Bengal army had joined the cause committed to these horrible crimes. It is this deliberate consent and willing commumity in the most abominable deeds that removes those who have joined the cause out of the pale of humanity. It is enough to have made common cause with the perpetrators. From such men nothing is to be expected but a repetition of these crimes at the first opportunity; and, if anybody else doubts it, we doubt it not, that the men who have once played us false, and vented their foul barbarism on our unhappy people, would always be hanrkering after an opportunity to do the same thing again. We need not, however, go so far into the calculation, for our natural horror of such deeds is quite enough. For our part, we are disposed to regard this as a great providential opportunity of showing to the Hindoos that we boo have a caste, and that it is a caste of nature and humanity. We regard all who are ever so remotely compromised in these crimes as fallen below the level of humanity, degraded to a Low class of brutes, and fit only to be knocked on bhe head, or crushed under the foot. They are Dbjects of contempt and detestation. It is proper ,nd useful, with a view to the future schoolinig ,f the Indian mind, to mark in every s-ay our disgust of these acts, their authors md their abettors. Humanity is towards that which is human, not towards that which is bestial. L'he latter is the category of the natives at aU mplicated in these crimes, and it ou*mt to be nade clear that we so regard them. The opporbunity should be equally improved to impress upon the Mussulman fanatics that if they consider it bheir bounden duty to extirpate Christians, their wives, and children, we also consider it our bounden luty to extirpate the wretches who hold this doebrine, and we will try conclusions with them on ,his point. Our soldiers, indeed, will not wait for our sneouragement to take the highest views and ,he sternest measures on the subject. Nor is it likely that our remarks will so much as reach them before the main part of the business is done. 3uch of the civil officers, too, as find themselves n the position of soldiers, charged with the main;enance of order in cities full of conspirators, and with good grounds to expect an explosion at any hour, are generally equal to the occasion. After he conduct of the Sepoys throughout, in protesting their loyalty and affection up to the very moment that they broke in upon church, or messroom, or bed, and butchered all, we must say we are disposed to leave the responsibility in the hands of those officers who do not shrink from it. If they have good proof that a few dozen fellows are plotting to re-enact these horrid scenes, or taking steps that obviously lead to them, we feel very sure they are doing their duty by handing the wretches over to the hangman with as little delay as possible. It is the best mercy in the end, for the traitors themselves will not improve by keeping alive, and it Is better they should have as few followers as possible. We cannot conceive for what reason, just at this juncture, when everything depends on prompt and speedy retribution, and on functionaries enjoying the confidence of support, the Indian Government has thought fit to publish a silly proclamation, throwing censure generally on the vigorous measures of its civil servants, and indirectly, but not the less pointedly, on the conduct of the army in the field. We maintain on this occasion, as we have often before, that it is the duty of a Government to put the best man in a place; but that in cases where he must act on the inspiration of the moment we must respect that inspiration, and not censure, clog, or discourage him, unless there should be a very strong case indeed against him. The Indian Government, however, has taken the contrary course. During the last two months the successive mails have brought the serious intelligence that from Allahabad to Calcutta every city was festering -with conspiracy and menaced with open insturrection, and that large bodies of niutineers wore roving about, at no great distance, in correspondence with traitors within. At Calcutta and some other large cities the danger w as remnoved by the arrival of European troops. But at one of the cities named as on the eve of an outbreak confidence was aU at once restored and the danger entirely dispelled by the energetic measures of the civil officer left in charge of the place by the simple expedient of hanging up several proved traitors. If 'we are correctly informed, the red-tapists of Calcutta have procured the removal of this meritorio-us officer, on the grouDd that he ought to have sent the men to Calcutta for trial, or merely kept them under surveillance, or that he ought to have let the city go through the regular process of unbounded confidence, massacre, conflagration, long siege, tardy rescue, and so forth. We cannlot respect,-indeed, we utterly despise a truckling, huckstering humanity, whica ahows itself at the cost of good men, and to the encouragement of traitors and villains. The reputation to be got by such a course is cheap and worthless; and we trIst the British people will be so much of our opinion on this point as to insist on Justice being dono to the victims of this base policy.
A century has, perhaps, changed our ideas on no subject more than on that of Prison Discipline. what a sene did a prison Pr9ut in the days Qf HOWARD and the author of the Vicar of Wakefield! The latter wrote without the least idea of showing up the system, he had no philanthropic aim; he merely lodged his hero in a gaol as an adventure; but what an interior ii thus incidentally described-men, women, and children, housebreakers, horse-stealers, highwaymen, unfortunate debtors and bankrupts, aU jammed together in a I yard ! What filthy, damp dungeons, did HOWARD visit,-as if fever, rheumatism, dirt, and rotterness had been deliberately enlisted, as so many destroying angels, in the cause of justice ! Wliat a transitioni from one of these Infernoes to a modern gaol, with its cleanliness, classifcation, good food, Bibles, and chaplain! Yet those were not ill-natured times in which criminals mere treated in this way; on the contrary, good-nature and civility were the order of the day; everybody was bowing to everybody, and saying polite things. But the idea had not occurred to these powdered gentlemen of such an application of benevolence, and it would have astonished them not a little. A gaol was a gaot to them-it was a place consecrated to darkneas and horror, the walls of its cells were ex offiio green with mould, its atmosphere was poisonous and bred fevers. It would not have been a gaol if it had not been all this. How inconaistent to make a gaol not a gaol ! There was this old idea of a gaol, then, to be shaken off. Then our excellent ancestors -were not so fond of syatem as we are. We mean no reflection on modern advance, but it must be admitted that modern benevolence is much allied with machinery, so that it is really difficult to tell whether the love of man or the love of system predominate, in many of our schemes. What a horrible mechanist is your philanthropist often, with those alarming powers of arrangement and self-extension, or rather likeone of those glutinoua monsters of the deep, ab - sorbing you into his egotistical enthusiastic. pulp' How you tremble on the.bsink of that darki cavernous abyss of love, as you would on the black crater of xEtna, before he galps you down, body, soul, and purse, into, it I Hew you shrink I back froiz his affectionate but fatal hug ! He is. the true modem alchymist, sorcerer, amd magician>* and the mantle of all theee worthies who sat with conical caps, amid globes, compaseesj. and hourgla*ses, hae. descended upou him. We have got rid, then, of that siinplemindedc notion of ow ancestors that a gaol wax a gaol, and necessarily ahorrible and disgusting plaee. Our gaols are not only gaols, but reformatories ; aned not only are our gaolaturned into reformatories, but now we have got other- special refoamatories. besides these, which go by that name. A section of the new Association. is devoted to this' subject,, an&ddiscussed it the other day at Birminigham. Thi& is a new idea of punishment, then, which has, only risen to general. acceptance comparatively laely. Bat the danger ise that new ideas when they gain ground ! are apt to exclide old ones. This is a gDeat mistake; but so it is; people are so elated with a new discovery that they think immediately they can do without the old: ground altogether, and reject it as a mere old bigoted prejudice. This is the tendency of modern thought as regards the ratimale of civil punishment. We are so full now of the notion of civil punishment ai reformatory, that we are losing the ides of it aa punishment. But we cannot do without this old idea. We may obaesve every now and then a determination sgringing up in inteigeat sections of society to do withoult old ideas. ht strikes a certain set of people that such andl xuh a practice, or such and such a sentiment, is a barbarismn, that it only belonged to an old stagc of the world that has passed away, and must now be considered obsolete. Thus, isome half-dozc years ago, before the RussianWar, war was. voted, a barbarism by the Manche3ter School, as indeed it is; now. " How absurd," it was ssid, " how gro"tesque, that civilized, intelligent people, should "coolly and deliberately meet in a field for the "purpose of killing each other I There must be "some other way of settling.national disputes thani "this most ridiculous one. flow incredible and "monstrous a thing is a war at this time of day ! "How it jars with our whole idea of civilization !" This was said, and not without some- reason for it. A bloody war in this 19th century did look like some horrible, grim, fantastic old idol, some vision of chaos rising up from a trapdoor in the stage of the civilized world. It looked something unreal and theatrical, that mnixture of splendour and death, blood, plumes, and banners, flashing swords, and deadly fire, to a generation Quakerized by uninterrupted trade and a forty years' peace. But facts ahowed that war was necessary-that war was ancient and was modern too. So, in the same way, it has been voted by some that the old notion of retributive justice, as a basis of civil punishment, is a barbarism, and the reformation of the criminal monopolizes the ground. But this is to theorize. It is a pity we can never strike out a new truth without making a theory of it. Let us alter our gaols if we please ; let us introduce decency, cleanliness, and classification, but a now gaol is not a new justice. Justice is still what it always was,-that when a man commits a crime he should be punished. There may be other reasons for his punishment,-the safety of society and his ownl reformation, but people may be quite sure that without this old idea of retribution civil justice would be a very feeble thing. What is it which gives al the interest to the administration of the law in the popular mind ? Is it the safety of the community, is it a benevolent anxiety for the future amendment of the criminal ? When some great crime has been committed, and the criminal is not yet discovered, what is it which fixes all eyes upon his expected capture, and converts all society into a police ? Is it a sense of expediency, the caloulation that the capture of the man wil add to the general collection of data which deters from crime ? No, it is the old idea of retribution, which allies popular feeling with civil justice, and without the assistance of popular feeling the courts of law could not do much. The Courts can punish a prisoner when he is put in the dock, but how is he to be g.t there? \Vho is the detector, the capturer? The police, you say. Yes; but what would the police do w-ithout the people? Whence come those hints, scattered bits of intelligence, and faint lights, which ultimately lead to the triumph of justice, and conduct the policeman, after wandering in a circuitous maze for weeks or months, to the town, the street, and the staircase of the garrtt where the wretched man lies concealed from the eye of the law? At first he may be anywhere, but the circle of evidence gradually closes in upon him, till at last the fatal ring contains its prey. At every step of this process, every lessening of this wvide circle of proof is gained by popular assistance or suggestion. There is a game at wich probably most of our readers have played: One of the company is blindfolded, put in the middle of the room, and told to search for som.- thing hidden in some purposely odd and unimaginable corner, or buried underneath some pile of books or cu3hions. Not a hint or a particle of guidance does he receive from any quarter but from a friendly piano, the chords of which swell loudly or subside into softness again as he approaches near to or recedes from the mysterious subject of the search. He hears the instrunment Bound louder and louder, and his spirits rise, and his heart expands with hope, but suddenly the notes fall again, and he knows that a malicious chance has turned his fingora aside. The instrument swells again, and he hopes again. He puts himself into the most intimate sympathy with the guiding music; hesubmits himself to it, he lets it stir his frst impules, follows up its hints, and unites his whole action with the oracular strain, till at last it swells into undoubted triumph, and announces the dis-overy. The police is of itself but a blindfolded searcber after a criminal, and depends entirely on guiding notes from the people to direct it. We have nothing to say, then, against the reformatory principle; it has our heartiest wishes for it success. We are only against its being made a theory of, to the exclusion of the old notions of civil juetice. We may alter the whole regirme and code of war; but war is the same thing in principle now that it was when the 6irst savage tribe repelled a hostile tribe. The old principle of forcible self-defence is the same; and so we may alter the whole rggime of our gaols, but the old principle of retributive justice continues. If these are barbarisms, all we can say is that human nature must be content to bear with them. She mav struggle and atruggle, but she cannot throw t}em off. There will be Eomething of the primitive rudeness a=J first infancy of society cleaving to it in the very last stage of its progress and under the most advanced light of civilization to remind it of its origin and parentage.
There is no need in this conry for arguing in favour of local self-government and the nao.- centralizing system. Whether rightly or wrongly, we are all agreed on this sub$ect But perhape there is a danger in this very imanimity. Mr.. Tom TAYL,OR has ventured to drw attention to the other side of the question in a paper read in, the " Public Health Section" of the Association for the Advancement of Social Science at Birningham. Without arguing at all againt local selfgovernment, he maintains, very properly, that a akeck is wanted on it. This is plaiN enough as regards certain points; for example, with respect to borrowing money. It is clear that albeal Board has no rigat to, tax posterity, that Plarliament alone ought to have that power, and this is the vule we act upon, The rule is, that the- sanction of the Treasury is required to any rnrtgage or alienation of corporate property, though esceptiona are made, and eertain Loal Improvement- Acts do' give this power to Corporations by 2petial enactment. But the want of a check is also pain. upon general grounds, for what is the composition of lecalBoards? The truth is, we staud up, for local power on the strength of a great general iaw which, appeals to our common sense,-namely, that people lnow their own affairs best, and because, with all the impediments attending a popelar system2, it acts,. on the whole,as a most powerful stilustoinationali activity. A thousand heads are much more suggestive than one; they have miceh greater power of obstruction, but they have much more originating power also. You collect a vast quantity of intel- ligence of some sort or other, good, bad4 and indifferent, together, and set iA working. The cauldron bubbles, seethes, and boils. There is a foaming, spitting, and frothing, but there is so much greater amount of inventive power under the system because there is so much greater quantity of mind out of which invention can come. And the action of brain upon brain in these collisions of heas is an excitement to thought. But, though on general laws we stand out for local self-government, we are aware that the material forsuch government is in many cases rude and coarse enough, that the noisy, bustling, and self-importat takeposession of the ground, to the exclusion of the discreet, quiet, and sound-judging, who stay away because they do not like the rude encounters which take place in such scenes. To be sure, this is an objection which may be raised against all government, central as well as local. Quiiet men do not get into Parliament, or, if they do, they are not the men who sway Parliament. Your quiet man of excellent judgment, but too scrupulous, or too idle, or too modest to act, is the man who Is governed all the world over, and not who governs. It must be admitted that a certain unpoetical hardness, vulgarly ealled " brass," enters a good deal into the composition of that able man, who, whether he fakes in this sublunary scene the form of a Caifre Chief, or a Railway Chairman, or the GRAND TIRnt; or a Parliamentary speaker, is the person who gives the turn to the course of earthly events. Still, it must be confessed that local administration does bring out very prominently obstreperous ignorance, prejudice, jealousy, and faction. Mlr. TAYLoR draws a distinction between large and small towns in this respect. " In our great cities-the "centres of manufacturing indtustry-the same "shrewdness and intelligene which are brought to "bear upon private enterprise are laid under con"tribution to a large extent for local govern"nent. But in our second or third-rate "towns the quality of the material for "local government is, I fear, deteriorating " rather than improving." It stands to reason that there should be central check and supervision when such is or may be the material of local government. On sanitary questions, for example, what divisions arise in towns, what factions fight each other when the interest of rival parishes or the plans of rival surveyors and builders come into competition ! Picture 200 people in a town discussing a plan of drainage, whether the filth of the town must be carried to the river or to a deodorizing reservoir. All sorts of questions come up in such a debate,-chymical ones, geological ones, engineering ones. Imagine a crow vd of persons comparing measurements and caletclations, cross-question- ing contractors, talking furiously about bad smells, bad water, bad air, all the different parts of the town having their different grievances, and trying to get their share of the public money ! It is plain that sanitary inmprovement will often go on slowly enough under such circumstances. A single vote will perhaps upset a long-considered sheme, an d compel everything to begin afresh again. A town sometimes w ill not spend the money which is wanted; people will not tax themselves. W Vhat is to be done in such a case ? When IvIr. ToUaInx SMTir sets down all central interfcrence whatever with local government as " bureauracy " and functionarism," he forgets that the local government is an interested party, and that, like a 'l interested parties, it requires watching. Sanitary improvements and improvements of a U kinds muat be paid for. It is quite true that the advantage to the inhabitants thomselves is in most casos enough to secure the outlay, without any other appeal being necessaxyy; but in sanitary caaes the main advantage, which is not the mere removal of a smell or an eyesore, but the prevention of disease, is something so prospective and contingent that it is rather difficult to proeure a proper outlay. The doctrine of acting upon chances is rather a philosophioal than a popular doctrine. How are you to a ct, then, in such a case?? Are you to leave a town entirely to itself, and let it spend as little money as it likes. or is there to be a central power of enI forcing improvement ? It is clear that the latter is wanted in some shape or other. You must not let filth accumulate, and allow that li;oovered satreara, whiclh once ra n through f resh roe n u amdows I amid lines of willcws, bYit rolls naor as black as ink with all the abominations of tho town In it, to spread poison and disease. There ate two sidews then, to eths qtrtion, and when lIr. TouL" SmrrH taQk «bout absolute local hndependence he forgets tls Teons of common se", and the w2dts of human tatuare.

Genius discoveras trrth, and puts new ieas into the pusblic mind, and, pub)lic opinion in turi curbs and iodifies genius. iHuman nature is futl of internal checks and counter-cIteeks, intellec balancing feeling, and feeling intillect. We must not make even our favourite principle of locaO self-governme 4 a hobby, and ride it unmnercifully. Indeed, Mr. To ust SsnTR himself, if we are rightly informed, while declain!dng agains3 all centraJ interference, suggests gratuitoiuly a most; definite and summary form of itt proposing a addi. tional Under Seeretary of $ate for the Rome Department, " to take mea3urer in the Court "of Queen's Bench to compel the executon of " proper works." The cry for local self-govern- men may, as MIr. ¶AlioR says only be in some! months a call for "a clear fieM for small jobs, "petty authority, and unchecked rule of NO. "1.'

This piece, which is rather built upon-than adaptedo ftom the Toacesl s of M. Scribo, is the., work of Mz. A C. Troughton, an author (we believe) new to the stage,, who, though he takes his plot from a.foreign source, displays consideraboe ambition in his dialogue. Brilliant repartee is. evidently not his aim, and a conversation more perfectly free from joke or point than thattn wrhich his,perronages Indulge itis scarcely possible to conceive; but, neverbheless, he preserves throughont a tone of. good soclety, audi tae chaacters, mot strongly marked, are delicotely. indicated throughout. In the treattment oft his subject hohel, however, made one mistake; and, though In recalling the work of 1s. Scribe to mind we are obliged to look through the vista of something like 25 years, we do not think he i found this mistake in his moodaL Unless oun, memory deoeives us, Toujour was in two . cts, one devotsd to the infatuation, the other to the cuzs.of the perverse yonng gentleman ; and,whether our meraory deceives usor not, it will be obvious to any one who impartially considers the story. that this is the natural division of the subj,bct Novw, the Englilsh piece Is in three ass, and the a fitlonal act is obtained by elongating thbs earher portion of the story, which, after all, is but introductory, whilI the latter portion, which contaixs the emtire Idea, presezves its original dimensions, and is thus rendered less sgnificant than it ought to be by the length of the prebce which ushers it In. There is no doubt that Mr. Troughton's inent was to elevab, a dramatic epigram, rather 5arcastic than otherwise in its tendency, into a moral comedy, iUuAtrating the mutual duties of parents and ofB-, spring. Nevertheless, however laudable the motive, it is always hazardous to extend the duratlan of a piece without a corresponding increase of incident, and there is no doabt that the success of Leading Strmn!7A unequivocal as it is, sbould be attributed rather to t-e smart, close, bustling third act than to the elaborate dia3ogues that have preceded it. The acting of the piece is exceedingly good. Mrs. Stirling gracefully intertwines the attribates of the fond mother and the shrewd woman of the world; Miss Wyndham is hearty and huoyanta s the good-.nmoured, unsopbisticated Flora; and Miss Swanborough aptly assumes the frigid haughtiness of the aristocratic E}ith. The more arduens than thankful part of Frank, wbose perverseness nevo, becomes rnal passion, Is sustained with commendable zeal by Mr. G. Vining, and Mr. Addison contrives ta elaborate a striking bit of individualty out of the old. deaf butler by the pesfection of his malke-up and the characteristic play of his countenance. Indeed, the imp2rsonation of the senior keeper in I3Fr. Wilkie Collins's Zi,qh,ousc seems to have given Mr. Addizon an inmpetus that separates his pesformance during the last few weeks firom that of his whole previous career. For years he has been known as a, seoriceable aetor of old gontlemen, whoso.merits bave made. no deep impression on the memory; bat.now he comes 'oe-- ward as the carefil elsborator of idiosynoracies, presentUg marked specimens of character that ar: est the eye, how-vor abundantly the stagOe may be neoplei.

These, Sir, are days of what is called " muscuar Christianity ;" there is a great ral bustling going on-school fuss, pulpit fuss, plaLbrm and post-,andial fuss, all- aiming at manuh good. There is a wonder.ul development of the `"bieeps," but 30mehow the neruous strong stroka has yet to be aiven. Sin is as raaipant, as well anw as foully drcaed as ever.

The meetings are of lirnited duration, they thern disperse, and the oldest forester, I believe, cannot tell why they came, what they did beyond the noise and personal exhibition, nor is anything left behind that anyone would like to pick up. Surely, Sir, men in our day do much as these birds do. We have political, polemical, social " curling " groundsg; we are punctual to attend, fret our hour at the appointed spot, make the old noise, go aw;ay and return again, again to do the same, again to deplore, to denounce, to propound, to prophesy, to theorize, eat, drink, sleep, and aooomp'lsh nothing.

IREL AND. (F1R' OUTnR 0WV tORRF.RP01vlmv' ) DUBLOT, TUESDAY MORNINa. ME1ETING OF THE ROMXA CATHOLIC BISHQOPX. Tho Freenan of this morning chronicles the arrival in Dublin of I1 Roman Catholic prelates, who, along with further reinforcements from the provinces, are to raeet at the Metropolitan Presbytery to-day " for the consideration of several mat-ers of importance." MNCUMBERED ESTATES COURT. On Saturday the estates of Mr. W. H. Rogers -were put up for sale in the City of Cork by order of the Co;nmissioners. The property, connisting of the demesne lands of Lots, Lotamere, &c., situate amid some of the most beautiful scenery on the banks of the Lee, produced 23,G251. Five lots only -were disposed of, the amount realized by their sale being sufficient to discharge all the encumbrances on the estate. The new petitions in the Encumbered Court embrace property to the extent of about 11,0001. per annum. The Earl of Kenmare is a petitioner for the sale of his estates in Carlow, Kilkenny, and the Queen's County. The gross rent is -estimated at 4,0001. a-year and the encumbrances are met down at 110,0001. MR. SMlTH O'BlIEN. Mr. O'Brien has addressed a letter to Mr. John Francis Maguire, M.P., enclosing a subscription towards the fund worthily set on foot for the erection of a monument in memory of the late Father Mathew. Smiiall as the opportunity was, the exchieftain of Young Ireland has something to say -to attract the attention of his admirers, and accordingly the "Bunkeyism" of his countrymen (tbe phrase is the Cork Examirer's) furniahes a theme Tor bitter censure:- " I confems (he writes) that it pains and humiliates me -to perceive the readiness with wbich my countrymen award honorary distinction to the representatives of English dominion in this country without considering whether by their personal merits or by their connexlon, past or future, with this country they can rightfully claim a title to couple their names with the institutions and meraorLis of Ireland. I was amused by finding In a Cork newspaper which reached me lately an illustration of this tendency in the name given to a building appropriated to the insane, which is caUed I The EgliUnton Lunatic Asylum.' "Now, though I am not jealous of the aswciation of n-mes which I find in this particular case, I protest against the practice wbich has hitherto prevailed of leaving unhonoured the memory of the most illustrious children of our own sol while we bestow compliments, often empty because nndeserved upon every delegate who maybe sent for a tinxe to administer among us the dominion of England. Impressed with these feelings, I have recently witnessed with much satl faction the erectirn of a statue at Limerick to the memory of O'Connell, -which will, T trust, be soon followed by the construction of a memorial in honour of Patrick Sarsfield."
TO THE EDITOR OF TfHE TIAMS. Sir,-At a time when the publiW prints are teeming with .'er true tales of the treachery, ingratitude, and crueltie8 of tho Indian soldiery, it will be a rehef to aU riglt-minded People to hoar a contrasting story, aud one oqually true, of the generosity and good faith of an Indian Mussulman, a sowar of the Hyderabad Contingent, to whom I and another English lady owed our safety on the night of the mutiny of 'the 1st Cavalry at Aurungabad. There are few indeed df such tales to break tho monotony of horror of the atory of tho revolt of the Bengal army, and it seems an imperative ,duty not to hide under a bushel this welcore little ray of light shinig in a dark place. On the 12th of June, the day preceding the rmem open mutiny of the Ist Cavalry, Hyderabad Contingent, we heard That some part of that corps had armed itself on the previous night with the intention of advancing on the cantonment, but that from the absence of unanimity among the men the plan had been, for the time, abandoned. We heard also that they had spoken of murdering their officers. These and other reports made us feel very uneasy; bnt n the course of the morning a sowar of the 3d Cavalry, Hyderabad Contingent,' named Booran Bucksh, whom we had known for some little time, and whose character we had always rz apeoted for ita truthfulness and simplicity, came to my aiunband sad told him he need feel no apprehension for Ais family, for he had made every provhson for their staety and for that of a lady who was staying with us, to whose husband he wa greatly attached. He said, " They shall travel to Ahhmednuggur as my family," and, looking MP to oeaven, he sw3re " by Allah" that he would never sach that place alive alone. He added, " I will leave my children behind, and if any evil happen to yours you may .destroy them." On the evening of that day we thought it prudent to go -as usual to the bhnd to avoid the appearance of suspicioa -and as it became dusk we observed some horsemen watching a-s from a distance, and on going bome we heard that some -of the sowars of the lst Cavalry had been in the lines of the 2d Infantry to inquire which of the houses in the canton. mnent were ocoupied by English officers (the coops had only accently arrived at Anrungabad), and also to ascertain the state of feeling of the 2d, and their intended line of conduct should they receive orders to muarch towards Delhi. These and other facts whicb had come to our knowledge increased our anxiety, but faithful Booran Bucksh had said, " Fear Mnothing, I will watch day and night; sleep quietly, and the enoment danger approaches I will be with you." We tinPlioitly relied on him, and my husband having Issued some necesary order, for the night to a native officer of the 2d -'etired to rest. At i to'clock th6t night Booran returned to -us, and said we must prepare to leave, as the Cavalry were zgain arming. My husband, hastily commending us to hiwi .care, left us to make preparations to man the bridge between 'the cavalry and infantry lines, and Booran, placing us in a country cart, and covering its open front and back with sheets, in the fashion practised by the families of htussulrnans when travelling, armed himself, and, mounting his ,horse, proceeded at our side to a place some 20 miles distant, *whero wo halted for a time. We continued the jotrney for -several suc^essive days, till we reacbed Ahmednuggur, and 'he endeavoured the whole time, by the most vigilant atten tion and kindness, to lessen the discomforts of the road. I,n the course of the four or five days I several times offered himi -s bag of rupees, which I begged, nay, besought him to take and use as freely for his own wants as for ours, bnt I could only persuade him to take very small sums from time to -time, as they were required for onr expenses. Again a"d -gain in the course of our subpequent Intercourse, knowing Eihm to be much emibartassed by a large and unavoidable addi. -ion to his usual expenses, I begged him with great earnestness -to allow nue to relieve his necessi:ies, or even (as I found it Elmpossible to induce him to listen to this proposal) to accept jAny sUnm he might require for a time, and till, possibly, he I calght be in better circumstantes; he sBaid it would be a " great disgrace" to him to accept money fromn me, and that ihe only desired " that his name might be good" among the Ritglish. and neither by tears nor entreaties could I ever persuade him to change his mind. I had some difficulty in lnducing him even to accept as a nmemorial a ring of little value which I chanced to have on m y finger when I bade hlim farewell, but the tears streamed from hit eyes when I *,old him I felt I owed him mnore than I ever could repay, .and that to the latoGt hour of my life I should consider him .one of my most valued friends. Since the above circumn. ,Aance occurred Booran's house las been burnt down, as it Is mpposed, by some one initnical to the English. IJp to the time I left India-now about two monthsago-this g0ood and true-hearted man bad not been promoted, but. I ope and trnut he may be so ere long, for surely both poli y and gratitude would suggest that in times like these n, instance of fidelity and attechmem,t on the part of the Indi%n noldier to the Englieh ahould fail to be both publicly an I ,privately recopnized and rewarded. I am, Sir, yours faithfull. AN ENGLTSH LADY. .iJ AU. ThIs Wm the rU ient %bat mTutile &d cuit down Brialie VmokeLz,o at 813oranam two Iear" apQ.

"Sir,-There will be a county meeting held at Woroester on Saturday next, one principal object ot which will be to raise subecriptions in aid of the Indian Relief Fund. " I therefore venture to trouble you with a letter of inquiry as to the proceedings of the Mansion-house Conimilttee. " A preliminary meeting was held at Worcester yesterday, and I was thore toid by several gentlemen, as I have heard from many quarters elsewhere, that there exists in the publio mind in combination with a desiro to subscribe a feeling that no adequate security has yet been offered with respect either to the responsibility under which the fund is to be ad ministered, or the principles, regulations, or conditions under which it is to be Applied. "I shalls therefore feel obliged to you if you can. send me any summary of your plau, or other informatlon, whiah may tend to mitigate a feeling of distrust which is much to be lamented. " I hope this application Wvll not be conidered incon. slstent with the sincere respect which is generaUly felt, anid in which I cordially concur, for the charltab'le exertions of the Lord Mayor on this subject.

I enclose to you & list of the names of the gentlemen who compose the Relief and Finauce Committees, -which you will fiud to include East India direotors, Bank directors, merchants and bankers, and officers, both military and civil, who have occupied important positions in India. " The meetings of these committees are uniformly weUl attended, the Relief Commaittee being assisted by two honorary secretaries, whose laborious duty it is to investigate aud report upon every case for the relief of whioh application is made to the Fund. "The committee have placed themselves In communication with the Relief Committee at Calcutta, enclosing to them the accompanying address and resolutions, requesting their suggestions, and the transmission by every mail of a full record of their uroceedings, including an account of their receipts and expenditure, and the particulars of every case to which they afford relief. " I will only add that a concurrent audit of the accounts of the committee is conducted under the supervision of Mr. Anderson, of the Treasury ; Mr. Andoe, of the Audit-offioe and Mr. Prescott, of the firm of Grote, Prescott, and Co.

Pakington, Bart." The following account of the proceedings of the committee in Calcutta will be read with interest:- "1 A meeting of the General Committee of the Relief Fund was held at the office of Messrs.

A county meetIng, called by the Eigh Sheriff, Mr. Robert Biddulph, was held yesterday afternoon In the ShirebaliL The High Sheriff was in the chair, and among those present were the Bishop of Hereford, Mr. Booker Blakemore M.P., Mr. George Clive, MI.P., the Rev. Arher Clive, the Dean of Hereford, the Recorder, and Mr. W. Money Kyrll. The Bisao' proposed the first resolution *- "T T thti meeting deeplys; mpathizas with the ufferm by the mutiny in Indis, and desires to expre Its abborenoe of the cruelties ccmmitted on detenceless woomensad chlbden in that o,,untry.0 The mutiny (he said) had sometimes been attributed to tho oTser zeal of our missionaries; but to him It appeared that it was the want of missionary exertions which had produced it. Upon what ground could It be said that the misslonaries bad in any measure contributed to this result? Who were the people who had revolted? Were they not the mercenary troops who had been employed by the East India Government, and not the vast native population of the country ? (Hear.) Seeing that it had been a revolt of mercenary soldiers, we could hardly wonder that such atrocties had been committed, because all hisory told usswhathorrible cruelties had been committed by mercenary troops when once excited to sedition. In fact, it seemed to be the natnre of rnereocnarles to commit themselves and their followers to extraordinary acts of cruelty. They must be rbused to desperation at once, and thus we found that that treacherous monster in humsan shape whose name had unhapoily become so familiar to almost every child in England had een obliged by policy to resort to extraordinary measures of violence. But we might derive encouragement from the fact that all these disturbances had been brought about by a tumultary band. Was it likely that the Mahomedan and the Hindoo could cordially unite in carrying out any commou object? They might, indeed, pretenld that their reli. gion had been assailed, but they knew that that was not the case-they knew that their religion had been scrupulously respected, and that England had not devoted the power of its Christian Church to the work of proselytizing, Though, however, we had not given the blhssings of a Christian education to the Indian people, we had given to them such an education as had trained up many men as able disputants, who were eager to discuss points of theology and questions of policy, and who, at Calcutta and elsewhere iead with avidity translations of Parliamentary debat s, tstimates, &o., from the English newspapers. Such men we bad trained up wvithout the foundation of the Christian religion, and, having no sound principle to guide the,n they were ready to follow any leader who seight be found prepared to lead them on to change, revolution, and violence. Such were the principles that had been at woik in Ildia; and hetrusted that, as a result of the sad experieuce which we had gained, the troops who bad been sert out to fight the country's battles would, at the earliest convensient season, bie follov;ed by the mnore nescefulsoldiers of the uross or Christ, audl that Wre should regard the present trials as a rebuke of Providence for our baving done so little as a nation to spread the truths of the Gospel in India. (Bear, hear.) Mr. BOoKEREBLAREMORE, M.P., seconded the resolution, which was unanimously adopted. Itir. W. A LSIONEY Kra,E proposed thenanhreeolutlon" Tbat %uhcstpDions le oollited in this county in aid of Lh urgeist wants of the euff,rera; and thxtge, tkimen bh-ehy lr.rited to f'rn local committets for thu purpor., of collecting subscrip,tions a iS forc wasding the ramse to the Central Comiauttee in Lwoao'o." Mr. G. CLivE, hLP., in seconding tbh- resolution, said, he eoncurred with the Bishop that missionarise did not cause the rebellion, and believed the grariual di:oo,eiastisn of religion not unfavourable to our domnison in India. The labours of the missionaries, as far as. they had gone, had tended rather to pievent than to cause.reblelion. ThEk ast India Company had for many years regarded tbat empire as a gem which should he kept entirely to themselves; it had never been really open and free to the eaterprioe of, the British subject. In mary parts of the scuth it vwas as bealthy and salubrious as our ovt counitry, an it those provinces had teen colonized by Ehglish, Sotch, and iish, we should not have been in suc& an oesurgeA*y as this. The Bengal army had beenm taughb to believe Itself superior to anything that ouhkIbe bronght against it, and a mutinous spirit had been r idly doveloped, -which might ;atan earlier stage have been rlecked.

MILITARY AND NAVAL I2NTBLLGRNCE. Yesterday a general court-martial assembled at Chatham garrison, by ord er of his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, for the tril of Lieutenant George Wiliam Vansittart Yule, Royal Engineers, on a number of charges preferred against him by the authorities at the Horse Guards. The court was composed of the following members- Colonel C. lrhirst, commanding the 3d battalion at Chatham garrison, president; Lieutenant-Colonel G. Elliott, Royal Matines; Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. G. Ross, Royal Engineers; Lieutenant-Colonel J H. GHascoigne, Royal Marines; Major D. G. A. Darrock, 3d battalion; Major A. Wombwell, 2d battalion; Captain 3. V.

The Deputy-Assist. ant Adjutant-General, Lieutenaut-Colonel J. W. Reynolds, offieiated as Deputy Judge-Advocate. The principal charges on which the prisoner was arraigned were,-first, absenting himself from early morn ig parade on the mornings of the 31st of August, and the let, 2d, 3d, and 4th of September, although ordered by Major B. P. N. H. Nugent, the adjutant, to be on paradeat 6 o'clock. Second, absenting himself ont several ocecsions from the officers' hall of study, Brompton, and when desired to wite- a letr explaining his reasons for so doing, allowing the officlal letter to remain unAnswered for a period of 23 hours. Third, absenting himself from a regimental court.nartial ordered to assemble at Brompton barracks on the 6th of September. Fourth, assigning unsatisfactoryreasons in a letter he wrote to Major Nugent, explaining his absence from the court-martiaL Fifth, for scandalous conduct, unbecoming the character of an officer and gentleman,in having stated that he was absent from his quarters all day on the 5th of September, and that he did not therefore see Major Nugent's letter, aud also inl furthAb falsely stating that he left his room at 1 p.m. on the 9th.-of September and did not return until 5 o'clock in the afternoon, when he was not absent from his room that day until 6 o'clock in the afternoon. The prisoner pleaded "Not Guilty" to the whole of the charges. The only evidence taken yesterday wAs that of Major Nugent, whose examination occupiea the entire day until the Court rose. The witness stated that, although he had ordered the prisener to attend early parade, he had neglected doing so on the several occasions mentioned in the charges, and had forwarded trifling aud unsatisfactory excuses for his absence. He also proved the prisoner's absence from the hall of study from 8 till 8.45 on several occa9ions and likewise his absenting himself from the regimentaf court-martial, of which he was a member, alleglng as n excuse that he had private business to transact in the town. The prisoner cross-examined the witness with the view of sbhowing that his absence on the occasions referred to resulted from his being unacquainted with the general orders. At 4 o'clock the Court adjourmed until this morning, when the trial, which is expected to occupy several days, will be resumed. Yesterday an order was received by Colonel W. H. Eden, Commandant at Chatham garrison, directing the whole of the available non-commissioned officers and men of the 94th and 98th depots to be medically inspected this day, at Fort Pitt, by Dr, J. .

The number of recruits arrving at Chatham weekly averages nearly 300. Mr. Charles S. Icely, chief engineer, R.N., has been ap. pointed to the Scylla, 16, at Sheerness.

T!HB INDIAN MUTINIES. The following are extract from a letter dated Allahabad, September 6:- " General Outram's forces marched In two columns. The first, of 683 men, left this yesterday (5th) at 1 o'clock. The second, also of 680 men, marched with the General at 10 o'clock last night. The advance column it is intended should reach Cawnpore on the 10th inst., and the General on the 11th of September, and if General Havelock has by that time managed the crossing the whole force wDll at once move on to Lucknow, and the place has every chance of being relieved by the 15th or 16th, and, even allowing for delay in the crossing, by the 20th. The rivers have all fallen wonderfully, the Jumn a having gone down 30 feet in a week ; this will help the crossing greatly. and enable us to act on the enemy's flanks advantageously on the march to Luoknow, which could not be done at the time of the previons advance owing to the whole country being under water. We have information that the Lucknow garrisen have provisions to last them until the 20th inst. General Ontram has taken some beavy guns drawn by elephants." In another letter it is mentioned that Mr. Colvin is prepared to aid a column advancing on Delhi with camels and other carriage as they approach Agra. At Meerut they ha-re also collected c&arage to some extent. The 5th and 90th are armed with Enfield rifles. In another letter, dated the 29th of August, writes from Allahabad:- "W We have sent on 400 men this week to Cawnpore by tran (40 miles), and the sick and wounded men of General Havelockls force arc now on their way here, and will come in the last 40 miles by railway." It appears from the above extracts that in addition to the two columns of Outram's force of 683+ 680=1,363; a detachment of 400 men had Dreceded him, which would give a total reinforcement of 1,763.

In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,016; but as the deaths of last week occurred In an Increased population, the average, to admit of comparison, should be raised in proportion to the fn. crass, in which case it wil becorme 1,118. It is to be in. ferred that the metropolitan population now enjoy good health, for the figures show that more than 100 persons survived last week whosa names would have been ploacd on the registers if the average rate of mortality had pre. va.led. The births were very numerous last week, and exoeeded the death s by 782. The deaths from diarrhcea were 39, belng nearly the same as in the previous week. Of that number 25 occurred to children under two years of age. Scarlatina has increased considerably; it was fatal in 52 and 49 cases in the last two weeks. Three children died within nine days of scarlatins maligna in a house in Wilderness-row, Clerkenwell; in reference to which Cases the medical attendant adverts to the bad condition of the house and its neighbourhood, and to the fact that one of the dead bodies wAs retained for seven days among the living. Four children died of the same disease in the south sub. district of Chelsea; two oftheseIn a family in Beaufort-terrace west. Two deaths occurred frqno smallpox In Wellesley-street, Somers-town; in one of the caseS a woman of 27 years waa the sufferer. Foour deaths from cholermad choleraic diarrho3a were registered last week. In Bethnal-green one girl, aged 4* years, and one boy, aged 6 years, died at 17, Cranbrookstreet of choleraic dlarrhoea; and one girl, aged 2, died of cholera infantum at 2, Sweet Apple squsre, on Saturday, the 10th of October. The soD of a brass-finisher, aged 14, died of " Asiatic cholera" at 2, Peter-street, Bromley, after an Illness of 20 hours. He worked in a factory on the banks of the Thames. "H e was perfectly well," Dr. Bain reports, " on Thursday night, his father having taken him to a tailor's for a new coat; at 5 o'dock on Friday morning he was seized with diarrhoca, vomiting, great prostration, darkness of the surface, thirst, loss of voice." A.t 1 o'clock on Satarday morning the poor boy died. Seven deaths by cholera have also been registered in the West Hamn district, which adjoins London, but is not within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Act. Cases of diarrhoea and of cholera occur every year in London; but the annexed case, which was published in a former table, appearedto bear an epidemiccharacter:- St. Olave-St. John.-At Horsleydown, on board the LAutken, on the 22d of September, a seaman, aged 27 years, " cholera Asiatica (19 hours)." Mr. Platt7 the registrar, says, " The ship Luiteen arrived at Horsley. down, St. Jo hn's, on the afternoon of the 21st inst. from Harburg (Hanover); she bad touched at Glackstadt and stopped there 20 hours, at which place cholera raged lately, and carried off 5 per cent. of the inhabitants. Deceased had not been ashore at Horaleydown." An immense commerce is carried on between England and HAmburg, on the Elbe, in vessels which are in a very unsatisfactory sanitary condition, the berths of the steamers conveying passengers being at times satuated by the steam of waterclosets, The condition of the ordinary vessels may be easily imagined. To avoid the delays of quarantine all steamers should undergo sanitary inspection, and the sailing vessels in the river should be thoroughly cleansed. They should get pure water, and they would not then form a bridge over which epidemics can march from EHaburg to London. Dr. R. D. Thomson has repeated his analysis of the water supplied by the Southwrk Company. On the 14th of Ootober a gallon of It contained only 17 6 grains of extraneous matter. Oa the 15th of October the total impurity in the pump-well of Abbey-row, West Harn, amounted to 5616 grains in a gallon, comprising 4-40 grains of organic matter. All the London waters should be analyzed weekly under preeent circumstances for the protection of the public. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean barometricsl reading in the week was 29 915 inches; on two days the mean reading was above S0 inches. The mean temperature of the week was 552 deg., whlch is 4'9 dcg. above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determ-ned by Mr. Glaisher). The mean daily temperature was above the average throughout the week. The highest reading of the thermometer in the shade occurred on Monday, and was 67'? deg.* the lowest was 423 deg., and occurred on Wed. nesday. The range of the week was therefore 25-4 deg.

SUBWAYS IXV THE hfET1OPOLIS. In January last the Metropolitan Board of Works deter'mined to offer prizes for designs showing the best mode of layilg out the surface and subsoil of sareets, and the most convenient diposition of " the privxte vaults, sewers, gas and rater pipes, telegraph wires, with any parta of the eoil appropriated to other useful purposes." Competitors were required to furuish designs and estimates for streete described as " first-sinai" and " seond-class," adapting their plans to A new street in Southiwark, 70 feet in width, as an example of the first clans, and to a new street In Westminuster, 50 feot wide, as an example of the second Thirty-nine competitors entered the lists, and their plans and draWDngs wer referred to a comMIttee of seven gentlermen, including three members of the Board of Works-the, chairman (Mr. 'Thwaltes), Mr. Alderman Cubitt, and Mr. Alexander Wright; three civil engineers-Messrs. Roberb Stephenson, T. Hawkeeley, and George Lowe; and Mx. T. R. Wyatt, architect; who were assisted in their labours by Mlr. Bzalgette, the engineer, and Mr. F. Xarrable, the superintending architect to the Board. Three prizes were offered for plans for each cLass of streets, and the committee have awarded the first prize in the first class, 100 guineas, tG Mr. I. L . Davis, 227, Midahill West; the second prize of 5D guineas to Mr. J. T. Knowles, 1, Raymond-building8, Grays-inn; and the third prize of 10 guinea, to Mes F. and A. Warren, 2, Duke.street, Adelphi. Three prlzes of 50 guineas, 20 guineas, and o guineas wero offered iD the second cLass, and they were respectively adjudged to Mr. W. H. Cu]lingford, 4S, Pembridge-villas, Bayswater ; Mr. W. Reddall, 3, Chapel-place, Poultry; and Messrs. Hughes and HopkiDs, 14, Park-street, Westminster. An opprtunity will be afforded to the public of forming their judgment upon the merits of all the candidates, whose plans and drawings have been arranged in the theatre of the Society of Arts, Jobn-street, Adelphi, in order that they may be thrown open to general inspection. Yesterday a private view of the designs took place and attracted rDany profesional gentlemen and members of the vaious public bodies In the metropolis and its suburbs, whose official position causes them to take a more than ordinary interest in the subject. After giving their award, the committee stated in their report that-- " The difficultie3 In the way of ardrneg st a saffa-tiry decoai have beeu very great; no general prinoiples were forund to appli, nor waa It posible either to approve or onudemn all the purts of awy of the Oeelva submitted to compettlton. " Your comraittlee bave therefose selected those desians which appeared to tbera to be most eusceptible of suca pr&ctical ada: titiona as would render them moet genermy spplicable to the lrroaulsucas of the metropolis." The main object of the gentlemen who have engaged In this competition has been to devise such a system of subways between the surface of the streets and the sewers as sbal suffice for the arrangement of gas aud water-pipes, telegraphio wires, &c., in such a manner that they may'ce readily accessible for repairs, and that the constant disturbance of the roadways in the most frequented thoroughfares, which is so fruitful a source of annoyance to passengers, and Interposes so serious an interruption to commercial traffic in our crowded and busy metropolis, may for the future be obviatemL There is, therefore, considerable simiarity in the prominent features of the various plansMost of the competitors propose the construction of a oontinuous Tault or passage, about six feet in height, under the Centre of the roadway in each street, along which the waterplpes, g.pipes, and telegraphic wires cau be carried, and from which ready access can be gained to the sewers beneath. The suagestions with regard to the arrangement of the water and gas services, as might be expected, differ very materially. In some of the designs the main waterpipes are placed on each side of the vaulted passage,the gaspipes being above or below them, while in others the waterpipes are arranged on one side the subway and the gMpipes on the other. It Is, of course, impossible by any written description to convey an accurate idea of numerous plans and sections -which differ materiaUy in their details, but we may endeavour to give a general description of two or three of the designs which have been stamped with the approval of the committee. 3Mr. Davis, to whom the first prize was awarded, proposes the formation of a continuous subway or passage, about 9ft. in width, under the centre of the road, and above the eower. On either side of this passage would run the water mains, and above them, supported upon stone corbels, the gas mains. He proposes that vaults should be constructed the whole length of the street on either side of the passage, and observes that this system would afford increased cel. larage to the houses-an important consideration to business quarters of the city. The subway would be wide enough to allow a man to walk in the centre, and the gas and water pipes would be fixed In such, a manner that they would be easily accessible for repairs. The telegraphic wires would be. carried along the subway on projecting stone corbelsa Entrance to the subway would be obtained by vaults reserved at the intersections of streets at distances of *boat 400 yards. If this plan were carried into effect any dist- bance, of the surface of the roadway, unless for the purpose of renewing it, would be rendered wholly unnecessiry. The cost of its adoption, including vaults for the houses, wouid be S6G. per lineal yard. or about 101. per yard more than the cost of the ordinary system. Mr. Knowles, who gained the second prize in the first class, proposes the formation of a central subway, 15ft. in width, with vaults on either side, the expense of the construction of the side vaults being defrayed by the owners of buildings fronting the street. He recommends that Tentilating shafts for the main sewers, to be carried sufilcieritly bigh to discharge all noxious gases into the atmosphere above the surrounding housetops, should be provided at the interseetions of streets at certain intervals. The estimated cost of this plan for first-class streets would be 22N. 14s. 7d. per Lineal yard, exolusive of the expense of constructing the private vaults, or 161. 5e. 7d. per yard for seeond-class streets. The first prize in the second class was obtained by Mr. Cullingford, who proposes the formation of a pasge over the main sewer, along which the pipes for the supply of wat'er and gas and the telegraphic wires caa be fixed. He suggests that the sewers and passaes should be ventilated by means of fiues. carried intothe chimneys of each alternate house, side by sido with the kdtchen fues, with which they should be carried up to the top of the buildlng. The cost of this design appliedto a first-claes street would not exceed 151. per lIneal yard, or 121. per yard for a second-clas street. Mr. Reddall, to whom the second prize in the second class was adjudged, suggests the formation of a continuous passage below the footpaths of suffictent eapacity to contain the water and gas pipes, and to allow workmen to perform all necessary repairs and alterations. Ea also recommendsmeans for preventfng the escape of edifXvium from the *ewers, and proposes a, system of ventilation vary similar to 'hat suggested by Mr. Cullingford. The estimated expense of carrying out this plan would be 2Sl. per lineal yard for a first-class street, and with slight modifications the system would be applicable to second-class streets. Many of the designs are very elaborato,, and-if the obstacle of expense should be surmounteif-will doubtless afford valuable hints for the establishmentLofa complete and efflcient system of subways in the metropolis.

FOBEIGN INTELLrGENCE. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRPONDFNT.') (The followng appeared in o. seeond edition of yeetard"v -1 PARIS, OCT. 19, 6 P.. I alluded last week to the difficulty experienced by the mercantile and manufacturing classes of Paris in obtaining cash payments. The resolution come to by the Directors of the Bank of France to raise the discount on commercial paper from 5; to 6i per cent. has not improved their position. 'They have accepted the measure, however, ithout much complaint, preferring, no doubt, a comparativelY high p rice for accommodation rather than that the period or discountable bils should be shortened. The retail trade has improved during the past week. A considerable number of Parisians, and of foreigners who habitually reside here, have returned to town for the winter; and the demand for warm clothing, of which the neceasity is gradually making itself felt, has grown brisk. The " dead season " has lasted ionger than usual. The Lyons and St. Etienne manufacturers congratualate themselves on having received so few orders from the Jnited States this year, as they have thus escaped the consequences of the commercial crisis which has occasioned so much injury in the cbief towns of the Union. The last advices from New York announce that French siUks were selling in that city at from 25 to 30 per cent. under the manufacturers' prices at Lyons and St. Etienne, conmequently the shopkeepers do not intend to send orders to France until some improvement shaU take place. Laarge orders were received in the course of last week by the manufacturers of fancy articles (articWles de Paris) from St. Petersburg and other towns of Russia. Similar orders, it is confidently hoped, will be received to a greater extent, as the modifications lately introduced into the Customs' tariff of that country wiUl multiply the commercial transactions between Paris and St. Petersburg. The consequences of an abundant harvest are now indeed felt throughout France. The Drice of bread has fallen to 14 sous the 41b. loaf in Paris, and to 12 sous in several of the departments; and these are, 1 believe, the ordinary prices in plentiful years. There was no further fall in the cornmarket last week. Prices are firm, but without any appearance of a serious rise. The offers of wheat for sale were less numerous at the last Paris market. The farmers resisted a further reduction, and prices remained nearly the same as during the previous weeks, namely 31f. the 120 kilogrammes for wheat of the first quality, and from 28f. to 30f. for other descriptions. In the markets of the central departments quotations were lower, but were firm or higher f the east and in Alsace, where purchase were made on account of Prussia. The ship. ments of corn for Spain have contributed to keep up prices at Marseilles. Hard African wheat has nsen there from 34W. the measure of 160 litres to 35f. 50c. It appears that on Saturday last the market at A-rras was not overstocked, and that prices remained firm, without variation from the previous week. Seed wheat sold at 22f. the hectolitre. At Chartres much business was doing In wheat at a riss of If. the hectolitre; at Dijon it was firm at 23f. 50c. and 24f. the 100 kilo,,rammes, and flour at 44f. the sack of 125 kilogrammes. The market at Montereau was brisk, with an advance on wheat of 70c. the hectolitre. The Paris flour market was more active last week than for several weeks previous; prices were maintained at from 42f. to 55f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. The factors declared 4,680 sacks for delivery within ?0 days at these prices. In consequence of the firmness of the market, flour for bakers' use was more demanded than offered. Although a large quantity of wine has arzived at the wine market of Bercy, prices are wel sustained on all qualities, nor is any important reduction anticipated during the present year. An improvemnent has taken place in new wines in tho markets where prices had fallen, and Roussillon, which was sold in the country after the vintage at 751. the hectolitre, now brings 80fi and 85f. Brandies are also looking up. Spirits of wine distiled from beetroot is quoted at 1081. the heotolitre in Paris, and 104f. at LiUe. The distilers in the north, who felt apprehensions on account of the good vintage, are now more confident, as they learn that the wines of the present year will be kept for drinking, from their superior quality. The Moniteutr publishes the official return of the Customs revenue for the month of September and for the first nine months of the present year. For the former period the receipts amounted to 15,967,537f., being an increase over the correspondIng month of last year of 738,056f., and for the latter period to 143,180,538f., or 13,3S8,532f. more than in the corresponding months of 1856. The items of revenue which have shown the greatest increase during the nine months of the present year are-coffee, 5,528,668f.; potable liquors, 4,108,098f.; nahogany, 60,256f.; linen or hempen thread, 96,572f.; coal, 522,088f. ; indigo, 72,888f.; hemp, 128,153f. gold and silver, 63,469f. ; nitrates of potash and soda, 72,665f.; foreign sugar, 8,331.,692f.; linen and hempenwovengoods,25,618f.; sundries, 3,571,663f. Those articles which show the most material faUing off are-corn, 849,339f.; cochineal, 56,918f.; raw cotton, 1,064,596f.; oleaginous seeds, 15,839f.; taUow, 71,341f.; raw wool, 261,942f. rough castings, 714,493f. ; bar iron, 2,718,120f.; pepper, 11t,859f.; French colonial sugar, 3,061,888f. The plan for reconstituting the Ministry of the Interior, which was arranged by M. Billault, and of which the Emperor adjourned the examination until after the vacation, was submitted to His Majesty at the last Cabinet Council, and was approved, with the exception of some unimportant changes. A decree relative to this question is to be published during his stay at Compiegne. General de Goyon, who is now at Naples, is, it is said, charged with a private misslon to examine and report on the military forces of the various States of italy. Despatches have been received at the Foreignoffice from M. Lefevre de Becourt, French Minister to the Argentine Republic. They announce that the difficulties which existed with the Republic of Buenos Ayres are arranged, the President Urquiza having acceded to the demands of the French Government. A letter from Belgrade, of the 11th inst., states that the persons arrested on a charge of having conspired to assassinate the Chief of the State are confined in the prisons attached to the military hospital, where they are chained and watched by a numerous guard. It is thought that the two incendiary fires which broke out near the Palace, one the day preceding and the other the day of the arrests, are connected with the conspiracy. The Emperor, the Empress, and the Prince Imperial arrived at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon at Compi6gne, where their Majesties will remain until the middle of next month. To-day a number of guests are expected at the Palace, where they will remain for a week, and be succeeded by others; who have received invitations for the following, weeks.

It is such a notorious fact that the recent elections in Moldavia and Wallachia were conducted in a most illegal. manner that it appears unnecessary to lay before your readers any of the numerous letters which have reached mae on the subject. A person residing in Bucharest states that the heroes of 1848 have for soime timae past ccterrorlved" their fellowcitizens, and he expresses his belief that M, de Basily "is greatly disgusted with their conduct." No perfectly reliable intelligence has yet reached me on the subject, but it is very probable that my Bucharest friend is right in supposing that the Russian Commissioner disapproves the doings of the revolutionists in Moldavia and Wallachia, for the well-informed Constantinople correspondent of the Triester Zeitwtg wrote on the 10th inst. that M. de Basily had expresaed his disapprobation of the conduct of M. Place, who is, as I believe, the French Consul-General in Moldavia. The next statement made by the correspondent of the Triester Zeitung is so remarkable that it may be as well to give a literal translation of it ;- " The Russian Minister In this city has recelved a report from Mjl. de Basily, who openly asserts that the rlghts of tho Porte are being trodden under foot in the Principalities, and that such proceedings cannot possibly be tolerated. Further, the representative of the Czar at this Court has In the course of the week had two conferences with AaIl Pasha, and an in. terview with the Grand Vlzier, which lasted some hours Credible Information has been given me that M. de Bontenieff, in the name of his Sovereign, gave both statesmen extremely tranquillizing assurances." It is believed here that the Emperors Alexander and Francis Joseph came to some general understanding respecting the Danublan Principalities while they were together at Weinar, but It is not probable that such was the case. Is it not more likely that the two Russian diplomatists are alarmed at the preponderance which the ultra-democratic party has recently acquired In the two Principalities? An Austrian writes from Jassy that the Princess Vogorides persuaded her husband to forsake the anti-Unionist party but her intervention was unnecessary, for the Arince explaimed to his friends that he had joined the Unionists, " becauso it was a rule with him always to side with that party which had the beat chance of success." A misunderstanding has arisen between Turkey and Persia respecting certain frontier forts, and the Porte is about to send an Envoy Extraordinary to Teheran with powers which will enable him to settle the matter bremi manu. The diplomatlat In question is to leave Constantinople with Omar Pasla, who will start for Bagdad in a fortnight. The Osservatore Triestino has a letter of the 4th of September from Teheran, in which it is said that the Turkoman tribes have made inroads into and laid waste parts of the Persian provinces of Taberistan* and Ehorassan. Troops have been sent against the predatory Turkomans both from Teheran and Herat, According to letters from Bagdad, Said Mehemed Ibni Salem and Said Helal, two extremely influential sheiks, hava intervened between the Imaum of Muscat and Said Turk!, his brother, who lays claim to the sovereign power. The two sheiks propose that the Imaum shal give his brother the government of a province. Letters from Georgia make mention of the capture of the commander of the Russian fort of Nokka, in the province of Chik. The Rusian commander and 10 of his officers fell Into an ambuscade while out shooting, but he was not taken prisoner by the mountaineers until two o' his suite had been killed, and three others severely wounded. The Vienna Presse of this morning has a leading article on the subject of the incorporation of the Turkish district of Wasojevitz by Montenegro. That principality is with perfect justice accused of being in a state of permanent hostility with Its neighbours. Whenever they are in want of provisions or are tired of inactivity the Montenegrins make an inroad into the Austrian or Turkish territory, and, after having filled a sack or two with human heads, retire with whatever they can lay their hands on. A'ustria, for some reason which is known only to her rulers, invariably pockets the affronts which she receives from the Montenegrins; but the Turks are less peaceably inclined, and have repeatedly inflicted severe punishment on their assailants. The Presse says:- " Cettinye is the principal seat of the national party, whose avowed object is to deliver all the Slaves in Europe from the Mahomedan yoke, and to unite thbm under the rule of Prince Daniel, who lnceantly agitatea against the Porte, and exdites the nahiss (districts) and tribes to sedi. tion. The Montenegins positively refue to acknowledge the supremacy of the Porte, and if some measures are not spoedily taken to keep Prince Daniel in check, the integrity of Turkey will soon be as much endangered by the Slaves rA it is by the .oumans. The Slavonic raS in Euraopean Turkey are only waiting for a favouzable opportunity to rlse, and Prince Daniel consIdere himself appointed by Providence to be aS the head of the great national move. ment." There is little or no doubt in my mind that the Russians and Montenegrins were the originators of the conspiracy against the Hospodar of Servla, who during the war thwarted their plan for bringing about a general insurrection In the Tarkish provinces in Europe, by declaring that he was resolved to remain strictly neutraL . rince Alexander acquainted the Austrian Government with the intentions of the Russians, and the information led to the concentration of an Austrian corps d'arm4e, with the necessary pontoons for throwing bridges across the Save and the Danube. It is a fact, which must be well known to this Government, that a plan was formed by the Rusians for seizing the Hospodar and his official advisers and sending them across the river into Austria. In two or three days It will be officially made known to the public that no more railroad, shares wUl be brought into the market until the beginning of the year 1859, and it is tolerably certain that if the communication had been made a fortnight or three weeks ago the crisis would have been far less severe here. The creditors of Boskovitz and Co. have not yet accepted the proposal of the Credit Bank to advance a million of florins on the assets of the bankrupts, because that institution wishes to make conditions which are considered "unreasonable." The Credit Bank Is the prinipal creditor of the firm of Boskovitz, and it wishes to make the other creditors pay for the accommodation which it is willing to afford them by obtaining full security for its own claims. Ths in other countries would probably be considered fair enough, but Austrian men of business are prone to indulge in false sentiment, and to expect that others should do more for them than they would do for others. During the present criis the moneyed world has continually looked to the Finance Department for assistance, and it does not seem to feel that the ceaseless interference of Government is its bane. When the Credit Bank and the new railroad companies were established Baron Brack interfered in their affairs in a way which is fortunately totally unknown in England. Persons of his recommendation were made members of the different Boards, this or that firm had a certain amount of shares at par because he wished that it should be so, and the Credit Bank was obliged to invest much more of Its capital in new railroad shares than it was inclined to do. The moral pressure exercised was at last so unbearable that the Board of the Credit Bank lost patience, and positively declared that it would not take sharec in the Carinthian Railroad to the amount of 15,000,OOfl., which the Minister of Finance was endeavouring to force it to do. It Is now seriously considered whether the Austrian Bank should not raie the rate of dLicount, as it has been observed that foreign hous borrow money here at 5 per cent., instead of obtani"ng it at home at 7 per cent. ine measure would probably have been taken long ago had It not been feared that It might inerease the embarrassment of the mercantile men and manufacturers, many of whom are in a very tottering state. The Queen of Greece is on her way from Ischl to Trieste and Greece. It is now known that Her Majesty is endeavouring to persuade the Great Powers to transfer the succession to the throne of Greece from the house of Bavaria to that of Oldenburg. A Duke George Louis of Oldenburg wants a place, and his affectionate relative is willing to provide one for him. The Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom arrived at Yenice from Monza on the 14th inst., with the Archduchess Charlotte and her brother, the Duke of Flanders.

The Irnvalide biuks the silence that the Russian press seemed to hawve Imposed upon Itself on this head, and, indirectly referring to that rencontre, it expresses the hope that, although an everlasting peace may not be to be expected, it wvn nevertheless be easier for the future than it has been in times past, with the exercise of a little common sense and goodwill, t.3 maintain the European harmony. Before closing the article, however, the Invalide gives Sweden a little backhanded slap, and points out how that Power, of aU others, after having on mature reflection entered into an alliance offensive and defensive with England and France, felt no little trepidation at that meeting of the two Eml perors; and then consoles its Swedish neighbour with the assurance that a Russian never bears malice. The consolation, though kindUy meant perhap, is not very implicitly to be relied on, and it is to bohoped that Sweden finds in her own strength and her alliances something more satisfactory to fall back upon in case of disquieting intelligence reaching her from Russia. The press in Russia continues to devote its attention almost exclusively to the events pasin in India, and, from its observations on this suDject, we may in some degree appreciate the interest they inspire in that country. In a recent letter I pointed out to you in what degree the Russians feel themselves also nationally concerned in our conflict with the Governor of Canton, and to-day I will lay before you what the Invalide more particularly has said of lateon this subject, prefacing it with the remark that the Russian (Governnent seems to entertain lively apprehensions lest the unquiet rebellions spirit among the Mahomedans, which is giving us so much trouble, should spread across the Indus, and endanger or disquiet its recent acquisitions in Upper Asia. General Katenin, the Governor of Orenburg, has, it is understood, already taken his measures to put down with a strong hand any unusual symptoms of resistance or aggression against the intrusive foreigners. The Invalide pointa out that the latest news from India is anything but couleur de rose, and seems to justify the doubt which had lately been expressed, as some persons thought prematurely, as to whether England would succeed in " reconquering" India. While modestly refraining from pronouncing upon the future in anything like an oracular tone, it proceeds to take exception to the term " reconquer," and to show, that what EDgland now possesses of India, particularly her acquisitions made between 1757 and the beginning of this century, she did not so mnuch conquer by force of arms as she bought them up bit by bit. It will not deny that England has had able Generals, valiant armies, and has earned plentiful laurels in India; but, on the whole, its empire there Is the produce rather of arts than of arms. The arts here alluded to are explained to have been the diplomatic arts of the resident agents of the East India Company, and the time when they were most successful that period of general disunion aud distrust among the native Princes which ensued upon the fall of the Great MoguL The Invalide will not pass any judgment upon the course pursued by the East India Company under Clive, waren Hastings, and Wellesley, but does not at the same tlme imply that that rule was on the whole injurious to Inaia. It points out, however, that Lord Canning and Sir Colin Campbel have a totaUy different task to fulfil, and must set about it in a different manner from that In which their predecessors went about theirsm There are no longer any nabob3 and native Princes who can be bought over to ell their own country; such as are still alive of the old races are either in the receipt of subsidies, or are confined in fortresses, and have no Influence with the native population. India has now to be conquered for the firt time, and that too with the Vreatest despatch, for every month, nay, every week, of delay will see fresh enemies rise up around the English forees there. " What, however, wil England do if, instead of a paok of rebels, she finds she has 200,000,000 of malcontent,, oceupying 450,000 squar versts, to bring to reason ? Will England's strength suffice for this7 England has our best wishes towards her task of stifling this barbarous, atrocious rebellion, and we shaRl look on at her successes without envy. But can it be permitted, in case of England's strength being found wanting, that th:' enormous empire, inhabited by millions of human beings, and so rich In natural products, should be lost to commerce, industry, and civilization? What may be impossible for England's strength alone would be feasible for Europe united i a European protectorate must then take the place of England's exclusivo empire. The extension of eivilization in India would then be a common subjeet of interest to all Europe, and in that case there would be good ground to exclaim, better than the English journals do when calling for vengeance and extermination, 'Finis coronat Opus.'

The article in question was in no way officieuz; it only eontained the feeling of enlightened and educated men In Russia. The same freedom of expression which The Times vindicates for itself is a right enjoyed by other nations. The sanguinary scenes In India, the sacrifices that hai resulted from the barbarous fury of the Sepoys, had revived recollections of the English exploits ia Kertch and on the coast of Finland, but they ha I engendered only pity, and not revengeful joy.

The Bee can afford to pas lightly over the lion, for she is no cock (a hit at our Gallic nelcrhbours) to whom the lion's claws may be formidable~. Aproyos of the different Russian organs of the press, I may as well add here, at the end of my letter, that the Kreuz Zeitung has been showing itself very uninformed of late in connexion with The Times, which it took to task, and, to cover its own blunders, has been silly enough to fall fou of your correspondent here again, and affoi d him some tempting opportunities to showup the emptiness of its pretensions and the malevolence of its spite.

Ml. R. P. COLLIER, M.P., AND MIR. JAMES WHITE, M.P., AT PLYMOUTH. On Monday evening Mr. R. P. Collier and Mr. James Whits, the members for this borough, addressed their constituents in the hall of thae Mechanics' Institute. The hall was densely crowded, and on the members making their appearance they were greeted with loud and prolonged cheenng. Mr. oRowse, solicibor, presided. Mr. R. P. COLLIER on rlsing was received with applause. He explained his oft-repeated views as to the desirability and vantageof members of Parliament yearly meeting their constituents and explaining their votes-a course which was becoming popular. He was happy to say that both he and his colleague frequently sat on the same benches, and as frequentti voted on the same side, but of course there wqre times in wch their views differed, but he believed that in the main their opinions were in unison. (Applause.) He was perfectly well aware that at the present time the attention of those who comprised the meeting-in fact, the whole country-was almost wvholly absorbed in Indian affairs; but at the same time he reminded them that their attention ought not to be wholly abstracted from what occurred nt home, for It would be a double grievance and a double calamity if those affairs were allowed to interfere so greatly with their home affairs. He should make no further apology, therefore, for adverting to the affairs of the past session, bus at once proceed to them. He then detailed seriatim the measures which had been a4opted, and commented thereon; after which he referred to the measure for the emancipation of the Jews, which was passed in the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords-a measure respecting which the Liberal party of Plymouth were nearly unanimous on, and it was a rag of religious intolerance which ought to be swept away. (Applause*) He adverted brlefly to Parliamentary reform, and, while they were about that, they might as well reform their Indian administration (hear, hear), bat he believed this would depend on the people, and it the people desired It the Government would be compeled to follow their voice, and if the people desired it it would be done, ("Yes yes!") With regard to the Indian affairs, he dia not pretend to have access to any peculiar information which others did not possess, and were it not for his standing in the position of their representative be should not ocutpy their time by speaking on the subject. The question of India was one which must be brought before the House of Commons, and be dealt with in the shape of legixlation, therefore constituents had a right to inquire of their representative what course he intended to pursue. ("Hear," and applause.) This great calamity, the details of which were so horrible and heartrendibg, mighttend to beneficial results; he believed, in fact, it had already led to a highly benefi&al result-that df awakening the attention of the people of England, and at last seriously directing their attention to Indian affairs. The conscience of the oountry had been raised to the awful importanoe and responsibility which attended the government and direction of about 200,000,000 of human beings. When addressing a large assenbly he liked to speak the trath, whatever might be the consequences, and he stated without hesitation that the English people were to blame in not looking after and attendmg properly to their Indian affairs, Englandj had acquired a large empire bv what might be termed haphazard. It had been acquired by no principles; they did not know how they got it; they had got it by a series of events which the most daring romance-writer would hesitate to make the groundwork of a novel-so strange a fiction was It. It had been obtained haphazard and had been governed haphazard; it had been used as a digging for tho extraction of so much gold; it had been used to make fortunes, and there had been an immense amount of jobbery and corruption. The government had not been so bad as it might have been, or yet so good as it might be. It had not been exactly wicked, but it had been a careless, self-seeking, low, unprincipled, huckstering government. Still the worst form of European government was much better than the best native rule. After referring to the state in which India was formerly governed by the native princes, and the cruel and bloody wars so frequently waged against themselves with so much fury, he said that, in the first place, it was desirable to ascertain what was the nature of the revolt - secondly, what were the causes of it; thirdly, on what principles ought it to be dealt with; and, fourthly, how were they to prevent its recurrsnce and maintain permanently the Indian empire? These were the questions which presented themselves (applause); and he should make a few observations on them, What was the revolt? It was merely a military mutiny, and not a popular insurrection. They must dLstinguish between the two. The truth could not be concealed, for if it had been a popular insurrection, a rising of the whole natives of Indaa In a mass against the Government, we could no longer have maintained our Indian empire, and India would hAve had to be abandoned, and we should not again have set foot on its shores. It was essentially a military mutiny. The mer. cantile classes in India, such as the bankers, the merohants, the shopkeepers and traders had, fortunately for us, nothing to do with it. Some of the natIve population-and to their honour be it said-sheltered fugitives from the unheard of barbarities which were being perDetrated by the Sepoys, and this they did at great risk. If'the people had been against them they could not have held India; but, on the other hand, if the whole of the people had been with us, the mutiny would have been almoeS Impossible. The mutineers were not to be confounded with insurgents in a popular cause fighting for liberty or under a banner. If they gained the victory the Mahomedans and Hindoos would cut their own throats, All the European States had expressed their indignation at the unheard-of barbarities, and all continental nowspapers-with one or two villanous exceptionshad smpathiZed with England. Withrespect to the second qiest2on orinquiry-" What was the cause of this mutiny?" ow, here he confessed himself in a great degree at fault, as full information on Uhs subject waa not poaessed ; but it was somewhat strange that a mutiny of this sort, so lon in preparation-for so it appeared it wvas-should have beeU so exceedingly well organized as to escape the notioe 3nd observation of the Indian Government; and he could not but think there was shortsightedness somewhere, and that there was a little routine end red tape. The Government had been warned by Sir C. Napier, but had not attended to the warning. It had been said that the Indiscreet zeal of the missionaries in propagating the Gospel had been the cause of the mutiny. This he entirely discredited and did not believe there was any foundation in it. They could not disguise from themselves that the Christian faith had made but small progress in India, for he had been informed that all the converts in Bengal amounted to 10,000, and in Madras 40,000. Now, the outbreak had taken place in Bengal, and not in Madras, where the greatest number of converts were made, and that did not look as if the missionaries had had to do with it. There was this consideration,-the Government had confined the efforts of the missionaries, and had prohibited them from interfering with the Sepoys, and had themselves abstained as much as possible from interfering with their religion, although the suttee had been abolished and other barbarous rites and ceremonies of a similar nature. In abstaining from interfering with the religion of the Sepoys, they had carried their abstainlng gnciples so far as to be subversive to military discipline. He then quoted Instances of the ridiculous attention and subservieacy paid to the high caste Sepoys, and proved his Argument that it was subversive of military discipline. kie understood that the average number of Europeans in the presi. denoies were in Bengal 1 in 24, iu Madras 1 in 16; and in Bombay 1 in 9. Now, he could not help thinking this disproportion was too great. Although Delhi had been fortified, and extreme care taken in supp ly ing it with stores, &c., still there was the grievous oversl ht that there were no Europeans to take care of it, 'he tbird question was " How was this revolt to be dealt with?" On this point there could be no serious differenco of opinion, for he believed every Englshman whom he migbt address would agree that England must put forth her whole strength and energy for the purpose of putting it down with a high hand. It was absolutely necessary to restore the prestige which we have lost, and show nations that we are not to be Insulted and offended with impunity and without returning a severe and just punisbmeut. In fighting for our Indian empire wwevre, in fact, fighting for our own empire, for ther v ere those on the continent envious of England's greatness who were found bo say that her sun was declining, and if we failed to put down this mutiny would say that we had lost our native energy; tbat our country was on the wane (applause); therefore let them fight abroad, or eLe they might have to figbt at home. It was with satisfaction that they saw their soldiers had not deteriorated. The men who were fightina under Havelock were as valiant as those who fought under Wellington. The English troops had not only beaten 'be Irdians, but had beaten those very Sepoys whom they had themselves trained and instructed in arms. (Applause.) If in the absence of reinforcements they had been enabled to hold their own it might be confidently hoped that when the reinforcements arrived we should be speedilyvictorious. Therewould be ansarmyas great,or grebter, thau that in the Crimea, and led by an effioient commander-Sir Colin CampbelL (Applause.) He was a man who did not owe his position to high birth, but he had earned his rank by his achievements and behaviour in numberless battles; but he was afraid he would be hampered with bands of red tape. However, If he was, he must break them. He was not the one to breathe the cry of vengeance, but mattors could not be mincedL The ringleaders mus suffer death, and after the mutlny had neon pu cotwn iG was then the time to talk of elemjencJ and not at present. Nothing would rive him greater pleasure than to We a gang of the hig caste Brahinns breaking stones on the roads. (" Mear, hear," and applause.) Transport_tiou wonid be the punishment of al excepting the ringleaders, who must suffer death. The blgho-r the caste the greater had been the atrocities. The fourth question was the most important of all. That was, " ow were they to prevent a recurrence, and permanently secure their Indian em pire ?" This was a question which must without delay occupy the I attention of Parliament and the country. It was necessary the people of England should speak their minds, and whatever was required to be done would by the voice of public opinion be carried into effect. Publi oDinion was as necessary to ventilate the Government department as the air which they breathe was necessary to ventilate a room. Indi3n discussions were never attended by the members of the Iziouse; but this was becauso the debates on the sub3ject were never read ; and if the peoplo had read themn more interest would have been felt by the mem- I bors. It was nominally ruled by the East India Company, but really by the Board of Control, and it did seem to him that under this system there was a sort of juggled hocus- pocus existing, and no one knew who was responsible for what. ALl governing powers should bo vested in a Prime Minister, who alone should be as respoonsible for the government of India as ho was of this country. In organizing a fature Indian army great care should be taken that the European element was larger in proporrtion than hitherto. A native army must be organized -as the army could not be entirely an European one-and it must be re-organized on different prlnciplns. Hitherto high caste Brahmins had been selected, and these were the men who were at the bottom of the mischief. Civil reforms must also be made, and a new system of magisterial juris- diction, so as to secure to every man as far as possible his rights and privileges. (Applause.) Mr. J. Wncvz, on rising, was received with cheers. He detaled at length his short experience in the House of Commons, and briefly referred to the measures in which he had taken a part. He characterized the Jewish emancipation es a wreck of the moediaval ages, and which ought long since to have been swept away. He afterwards referred to the sll-engrossing topio of India, and dwelt with considerable length and ability on the mutiny question. Many thousands of the natives considered there was pollution in the greased cartridges, but it was to be remembered that for the last 50 years the rifle regiments had used greased cartridges, though it was true that the grease was of a somewhat differont colour. The ealamity had come, and we were unprepared for it, for Sir Charles Napier's warnings were not heeded, nor was that to be wondered at, when It was known in what strain he spoke of the Governor-General and the 1ast India Company. He stigmatized the Company as being agents of the Devil to make men miserable, aud used similar language in reference to the officials; therefore, he again assertod it was no wonder his suggestions passed unheeded. He did not considtrthe missionaries had done any harm, and that ho beheved was a grievous error which had been circulated to that effect. Some time since it came to light that the native officera employod to collect the taxes used means of torture as the quickest mode of obtaining the revenue and Government taxes. He believed good cause had been given for the rebellion of the people, but not for the mutiny of the military, which body were treated with every consideration. Of the opinion entertained with reference to British rule, he quoted an answer which had been given by a native when asked how he should like to be under the British rule and the answer was, " Of all misfortunes, save me from that." The nunber of Europeans there was not sufficiont, and he was confident that there were thousands on thousands of natives who had never seen a white man; in fact, the Europeans were in the proportion of 1 to every 5,000 Elin. dloos, and one magistrate had so large a district that he had to go 150 miles to try a chargo of murder. He was confident England had not done her duty with regard to India. (Hear.) India's greatest misfortunewastheconstitutionof a Board of Control, which wasa greatobstrnctionto her essential progress. He said this irrespective of all party, for no despatch could be sent out by the East India Company, whatever might be its tivial importance. unless it first passed the sa rvision of the Board of Control, and, as the Boardrmade no defence, the East India Cam pay were now abused. Itnmght be remembered that the Board of Control exercised the right to makue the Persian wrar and that the East India Company had nothlnx to do with it. After stating some further opinions, which were principally corroborative of Mr. Collier's view of the matter, and Which were interspersed with extracts from books and blue-books, the hon. member resamed his seat amid much cheering. A vote of confidence was pased to the hon. members, and after a vote of thanks to the chairman the meeting separated.
BANQU7ET TO LORD JOHN HAY. Lord John Hay, M.P. for the Wick district of Burghs, was entertained to a banquet at Wick on Thursday by a number of his constituents. Lord J. HAY, In speaking of India, said he had been for some years connected with India, and some of his relatives had been intimately associated with Its Government; so that he naturally felt a deep interest in the state of that country, and was in some n,easulre qualifled to speak on the present crisis. He thus continued:-" I shall not have the presumption to affirn what have been the causes that have led to the present state of matters there. I think it is right, and maybe useful, to state certain facts which may to some extent be regarded as the cause of the state of matters which we all deplore, We have seen it reported in the papers, and heard it in the speeches of public men, that the disturbances in India were long since prophesied by men of eminence, such as Sir Charles Napier and others, who are said to have warned the various Governments of the approaching outbreaks. Now, I confess I do not believe such to be the case. I have searched all the publio documents of which I could avail myself, and I have :never found the slghtest indication of any such waraing by these would-be prophets. It is said that Sir Charles Napier had asserted that the internal condition of India, the low state of discipline and the physical state of the army, were such as to lead to mutiny; but I have searched in vain for any statement of the sort On the contrary, I find that, instead of complaining of the state of the army, Sir Charles Napier was one of those who defended the army and its system of management, and cularly the Bengal army which is at the present time distinguished for mutiny and revolt. I do not mean to depreciate the merit of such a great man and high authority ; stiUl I think it right to state the fact which I have now given. Nor doI intend to relieve the East India Company of all blame. It would have been a strange thing indeed if, after an existence of 100 years, there had been no cause of complaint against the Company and its system of management; stil it Is worthy of notice that even Sir Charles Napier was favourable ko the present system; and consequently it seems to me that the Company were not so much to blame after all. With regard to the cause of the outbreak, it has been said that the introduction of the greased cartridges among the native troops has] been ;,he chief cause. For myself, I do not believe this to be a cause at all, and am satisfied that it has only been seized by the Mussulman to work up the minds of the Sepoys and induce them to revolt. (Cheers.) What maybe the real cause I do not pretend to allege. The great question seems to be in regard to the future. I do not say that we should interfere to break down caste in India- nor do I think it necessary or proper to interfere with ihe religion of the rpIe. I believo that all people should be allowed to profes8 and carry out any religion they pleaso, and that It Is not the duty of any Government to coerce. (Cheers.) In fact, I feel assured that our indirect interference with caste has done not a little to produce the present state of affairs. For instance, the establishmeht of railways in India, approved by every thinldn man has been one of the strongest blows against oaste. The fact of its changig the value of property, and of altering the condition or villages which had remianed in the saime state for hundreds of years, and given proprietors of land a new position in the country, has greatly affected caste. Another important thing which affects it is that whoever pays a certain money price for a seat in a railay carriage can sit side by side with the most powerfuuL Thus in India the greatest Brahmin has to sit by the sAde of a pariah, whom he regards as worsa than the dlrt on which he tres. This is indeed an ordinary ocurrence; and yet before the leveling influence of British rule was felt the same pariah, If he saw a Brahmin at a distance approachin him on the road, would have to go over the hedge or a ditch into the field, to avoid tainting the Brahmin. This is not an exaggerated view, but is a fair index to the general state of the people; and therefore we can fancy the existence of a very good reason for the higher classes not being particularly pleased with English rule. Among other things it has also boen the fact that promotion in civil situations has been by merit, to the great objection of men of high caste in India; consequently it is quite clear that men of low caste who did good service were better rewarded than men of high caste who performed fewer services, and whose ideas are that men low in a certain position, while they may descend, onuht never to rise. There Is another matter. This country has been accused of annexing large tracts of territory to our Indian dominions; but 1 think the charce has been made by those who are not sufficiently acquainted ith the question; for, while it cannot;be denied that considerable annexation has taken place, it Is not to be forgotten that the people have been greafly benefited by the change, and that no annexation has taken place without sufficient reason." With regard to the future of India, Lord John held that the Government had already shown by the activity displayed in sending out troops that the country might depend on Lord Palmerston, that he would introduce such vigorous measures to Parliament as would he worthy of support. On the subject ofrecrulting Lord John said,-"One thing I tbini- has been a mistake. I refer to tho measures adopted for recruiting. No doubt, there has beea great activity, yet the number of recruits has never exceeded 1,200 a-week and the reason appears to me that in the present state of tlo country, when wages are so high, and when fadilities fer the emigratlon of the surplus population are so abundant, a greater number cannot be expected to offer themselves to the service. But I feel convinced that were the standard height to be lowered there would be found among the people between the height of 5 feet I and the present standard a large number of exceeodingly strong and well-built men fit for the Iiidian service. There are many big men who bave no large heart, and many little ones who have quite enough of pluck. (Laughter and cheers.) And you must remember that inIndiathe tallestBrahmin would look very diminutive when placed by the side of the smallest man in this room. You winl therefore see the importance of my suggestion." Lord John defended the present system of purchse in the army, and contended that there was more necessity for looking for strong bodies and patriotic minds, well trained to physical service, than for offioers educated by set rule in mental or moral science. He said,-" We have only to look to the state of the troops in. India to see that something other than the knowledge of science is nocessary. It is quite evident that men of strong healthy systems, ab'e to endure fatigue, are needed, and that training in military science is far more necessary than in those branches on which examination now takes place. In the proession to which I have the honour to belong, and in which I have spent greater part of my life, such is not tbe case. There no officer is appointed who is not thoroughly acquainted with all the details of the profession." As to tho next session of Parliament he did not see why a Reform Bill should not be introduced as promised ; but it should be remembered that India was the a-engrossing topic at preient, and until that question was settled, or the way to its settlement more clearly sean, it wva not likely that any other subject not necessarily important and urgent would bave much chance of being discussed. As to himself and his Parliamentary conduct, he said:-" That I have no great gift of eloquence is quite true ; and if you had only seen as much of the Legislature as I have you would come to the conclusion, with myself, that the number of our orators is exceedingly smalL There are, no doubt, plentv of men who like to hear the sound of their own voice; but now, as in past times, as the history of the world proves, wlhile we have had miiany generals of eminence, the number of orators can almost bo counted on oar fingers. At the same time, I hope I shall ever be able to make myself intelligible to you, and to explain my views in a plain manner." A cordial vote of thanks was passed to Lord John for his cenduct as representative of the burghs.
MURDER AT METlR T-YVIL.-A man namod Cornelius Donohue met with his death at Merthyr TydvU on the night of Sunday, the 11th inst., under circumstances which involved a charge of murder against four persons named Ellen Burke, John Burke, Johanna Brien, and Timothy Sullivan. The coroner's jury who sat on the bodr of the deceased returned a verdict of "Manslaughter ' against Ellen Burke, but the police having brought the matter under the cogiance of Mr. J. 0. Fowler, stipendiary magistrate of Merthyr, along examination took place on Monday, whFen namerous witnesses deposed to having seen the assault on the decemed man, and that theprlsoners were engaged In it. The magIstrate oommitted John and Ellen Burke and Johanna Brien to take their trIal for the wilful murder of Donohue, and Sullivan was discharged, It appearirg that he had not taken ay part in the fray until after its fatal termination.
THE FATAL SHIPWRECK OP B3IDEFOBD, A(ORZ'H DEVON.? We briefly stated in The Timms a few days ago that a melancholy shipwreck, by which seven lives were lost, had occurred at Saunton Sands, off Bideford. The captain was among those saved, and from his statement some fuler particulars of the fatal disaster have been ascertained. It appears that the vessel, which was caled the Warden, wss an Amerioan bark I Mr Boshier, an inteligent man, being the commander. un Thursday afternoon she left the Mumbleo, laden with 460 tons of railway iron, previously shipped at Newport for Cuba. She set sail with a fair wind, but at 10 o'clock a squall came on, which induced the crew to furl the top-gallant sails; the jib wma split and carried away. Tbey then made Lundy Light, and kept it in view until 11 o'clock. The weather then began to thicken and rain, the vlind N. and N W vessel close hauled on a starboxid tack, sihted land about 12 o'clock, which was s. - posed to be Hartland-point, about three milea off; T. then hauled the mainail up, and wore the ship round on the port tack, close reefed topsails and courses, ship headMIn ENJ.N, wind blowing in violent gusts, rain ani hail falung heavily in drifts. Continued on same tack until half-past 2, when the man on the lookout cried ' Breakers ahead I" The captaia imagined at that time he had made a mistake in supposing the land he had sghted at 12 was Hartland Point, and that it mnst have been Baggy, and that the breakers seen were on the Helwick Sands; he then attempted to wear the ahip, but before she filled on the other tack she struck the ground. This was between 4 and 5 on Friday morning. The crew then cut away the main. mast, which went over the side. The boat stove. After remainig on the poop for a short time the crew took to the mizenmast, where they remained half-an-hour, when the mast went by the board, throwing them into the sea, which at the time was running mountains high. The cap. tain seized a part of the wreck, and escaped to land in a very exhausted state. Three of the crew also escaped -viz., John Ward, an American, of Lolel, State of Masa chusetts, Thomas M'Intyre, an Irishman, of county Mayo, and a Swede named John8ton. The remainder of the unhappy crew met a watery grave. Their namea were: -Minet, an American, chief mates Flavier Juderee, of Nova Scotia; a Swede named Fredericlson' the secord mate, HArry Haisted a trussian, wlho hd married in Boston, but leaves no family; a negro cook, name unknown - a Spanish boy, named Emanuel; and Charles Bradford, a boy of the State of Maine, in America The poor fellov a who escaped with their lives found shelter at the farm houses of Saunton, where they arrived between 7 and 8 o'clock-l'Intyre at Mr. James Huxtable's, Launton-court; and Johnston at the cottage of Charles Smith, a labourer cn the Barton; Captain Boshier and Ward at Mr. Janes Tucker's, the warrener, In Launton-village. The poor fellows lost everything the p essed-watches, money, and clothes. The vessel which, as wo have stated, wa American built, fir planked with oak ribs, was dashed in pieces in a very short time, and a more complete wreck was never seen. The coast was strewed for miles with frag. ments of spars, sails, cordage, and casIs and boxes, The active collector of Customs at the port, Mr. Richard White, was early on the spot directing operations, whither he was followed by Mr. Thomas B. Chanter, of Bideford, Lloyd's agent; a number of Coastguard men and of the county con. stabulary were also on duty. The herd of wreckers who hung upon the outskirts were disappointed of much booty, but there were a few instances of pilfering. Two of the bodies have since been washed ashore, one at Braunton, the other at Northam, on which inquesta have been held. The unfortunate survivors have received the greatest kindness from the persons on whose hospitality they were suddenly thrown. The Warden was the property of a Boston sner. chant, whose name she boro, and the vessel was partlaly insured. The cargo, worth 4,0001, was not iusured. An auction was held on Monday on Saunton Sands, when the d6lris of the vessel was disposed of, and fetched 1204

A NERvOrS TRAVELLEIR AD IiIs TRiu.-I recoently took a trip west, and while passing over the F- and L R. RH, being fond of " the weed," had taken my seat in the baggage car t for the purpose of indulgin in a "havanna,` when a nervous lndlvidual entered the car and commenced overhauling the bhiggage. The baggage maser, after eyelng him a moment, acosted him rather gruffly with, " What's wanting, Sir?" "I am look-ing for my trunk," demurely answered the nervous man. " 1 will take care of your trunk, Sir ; that is my business," retorted. the baggage master. " Oh 'I am awrare of that, Sir, but I would always much rather i.eep my trunk unIder my eye. " "Well, then, Sir, you ehould have been born an elephant, and thea you oould have your tunmk under your eye the whole time." The nervous man suddenly vamosed.-
THE COLLISioN OX H2HB SOUTH WiALaS BAzLt WAY. INEAT14, TuEDDAY. The Inquest on the body of Sarah Ann llarmuer was continued after the despatch of our parcel yesterday, and the evidence was concluded, an adjournu er.t taking place to this day for considering the verdict. The examination of William Davy, a porter at Stormy station, wvas proceeded -with after the last train left on iMonday afternoon. He went on to say that if the telegraph elerk at Port Talbot had been attentive and understo(d him be could have sent his messages, and prevented the up train leaving the Port Talbot station. lie was in tbe office when Days wvas workiDg the instrument, and heard liim repeatedly read the message, " Send down passengers on." Witness was looking over his bills at the time. Da¶s was working the telegraph at the time he read the message as being received from Port Talbot. JohnI)ays, the policeman at Stormnv, was recalled and corrected the !ast witness, swearing positively that the words which he read were, "H Have you sent the down train on e' and not '"Send down train on." Davy uust have misunderstood his first words. On the day of the accidert he sent a telegraphic messago to Mr. Langdon, the inspector at Swansea, to the effect that a collision had taken place near Stormy through Port Talbot sending a passenger train on after t6legraphing for the down train to coine down cn the up line. Mr. Tripp here produced a copy of this message, which ran in these words: "'These has been a pitch-tn between here and Port Talbot, owing to the sending on pamenger atter being telegraphed not to. Mr. Whlte sent with 6530 down on up uine, Three minutes after I seceived a message to say passenger bad left Port Talbot." Edgar Evans, the station-clerk at Port Talbot, who was examined on Friday,was recalled, and distinctly swore that the only message that be sent to Stormy on the morning of the accident was to keep all trains there, as a goods train had broken down, and that nothing more was received from Port Talbot than that they understood his message. He did not receive nor hear any such message from Stormy as, " Can passenger come on." Witness could not read a single needle instrument, and the Stormy man corld not read a double one. Remembered a lady speaking to him, but did not hear her say they appeared to be confused, and tlat Mr. Turner ought to be sent for. Barney, the porter at Port Talbot, being also recalled, swore that no such message was sent by the Stormy telegraph as "Can down passenger come on ?" He repeated in substance his evidenco given before, that he could not make out their telegraph messare from Stormy. There were two or three letters, hut he ;ould make no sense of them, and he remarked to Evans, the clerk, " They are making a fool of me." Did not receive any such message as 'Down train not come back from Pyle." At this stage an adjournment took place for half an hour, it being understood that an important witness would be rodaced who would speak to the receipt of a message of which the telegraph clerks themselves denied all know. ledge. Miss Catherine Llewellyn, a lady resident in the neighbourhood, depoEed,-I was at the Port Talbot station before the arrival of the up train which leaves Swansea at 10 25, and was in the office before they conmmenced issuing tickets to pamengers by that train. While there I heard a coicrsation between the clerks inside the counter. There was a bell ringing, and from what I heard I understood the tolegraph was working. They were trying to miake out a message. Heard the letters " c-a-n p-a-s-s-e-n-g-e-r-s c-o-m-e o-n" repeated, and then heard the words repeated "Can passengers come on ?" Then there was a discussion between the persons inside as to the answer to be given. Remember they discussed whether "Yes" was to be the answer. They argued upon the point, but I don't know what they decided upon. All this took place before the door was opened for issuing tickets. When the door was opened I took my ticket. There were two persons there then; one of them was Evans, the clerk. I said I thought Mr Turner ought to be bere; and Evans asked me "'Why so ?" I replied "Because they did not seem to understand the telegraph." Evans then said Mr. Turner would soon be there, and that he was engaged in removing a broken truck on the down line. I remained at the station until the arrival of the up train. I heard enough to convince mne that they were very much perplexed and embarrassed. I heard one say to the other, " WVhat can he nmcan l" That was 'when the aperture was closed, and they were carrying on the discussion about the telegraph, before tickets were given out. Beard also the Eentence, " Bere's a fine mess !" Heard a peat deal more, which I don't remember. Left Port Talbot by the up train, but heard nothing about the down train coming on the up line. I was told, while standing on the platfornm, that the train I was going in was not to leave until the down train came in. I feel quite convinced that the words I heard read off from the telegraph, were the words I have said-viz., "s Can passengers come on ?" I was alarmed at what I heard, but was persuaded to go on, hoping my fears were groundless. By the Jury.-I can't say whether they sfnt the answer "Yes." Made the remark to two persons that there was something amniss, and that there was confusion. One of tneEe partes was agentleman named Evans. Riohard K1napp, platform policenan at Port Talbot,proved that on the arrival of the up goods train !e stopped it and told Forshaw, the driver, he could not go on, for that the Irish train had broken down on Pyle Bank, and that perhaps they might have occasion to work a single line. Knew it had been done so SOnie time before, Afterwards ordered him to go into the top siding and put the train out of the way. Did not tell Forsbaw that they had telegraphed from Stormy that the clown train was coming on tho up line, and that he was not to move on. Did not say anything to him about telegrapb, nor about the down train coming on the up line, because he did not know anything about it. Never heard at any timne that morning before the up train left that the down train was coming on the up ] 'i. Detained the up goods 66 minutes, and the passenger train 51 minutes at Port Talbot. Asked Mr. Evans if he would start the train, but he said, " No," and then I said I would not. Saw Mr. Turner come in and give the signal " all right" for the up train to go on. He had not reached the station, the train started, and then witness saw Mr. Evans, the clerk, running across the line towards Mr. Turner. The passenger train started at 11 56. Peter forsey, of Carmarthen, traveller for soaue Bristol merchants, next presented himself for examination.-He was at Port Talbot on his way down to Briton Ferry, and saw the station master get on an engine and go up the line. Saw hlm return some time afterwards with a oods train. After waiting an hour and a quarter, and the own train not arriving, he askedEvans, the clerk, when the train was likely to arrive, and he replied, " I don't know. 1 don't understand the Stormy man, and he doesn't understand me." A porter added that theStormy man was not at his post, 'or that he did not answer his bell. When Mr. Turner returned after the arrival of the broken down goods train witness asked him when the down train would arrlve. He replied, " I suppose presently." He then asked him if he knew that a message had been received from Stormy to say that she left Stormy at 11 50, and he replied, " Oh, a parcel of fools, they don't know anything about it." Mr. Turner then wont into the office, and wftness outside the screen beard the message reiterated by the clerk, that the train had left Stormy at I I50. The clerk appeared to refer to a paper before him while telegraphing. Witness again asked Mr. Turner where was the down train, adding, "An accident is one thing and mismanagement another." He had seen the broken down train removed an hour and a-half before, and thought the down train ought to have arrived. Asked Mr. Turner if he had been to look for it. Mr. Turner replied, very pettishly and angrily, "Allow me to know hest what to do, and I shall not (or cannot) go to look for the train." A telegraphic message was then received-he believed fronm Swansea, from the general superintendent, Mr. Clarke-asking for the whereabouts of the train; on which MI r. Turner got on tbe engine and spoke to the driver, who shook his head. Other parties then got on the engine, some discussion took place, and Mr. Turner walked up the yard, when witness saw a man running froni the direction of Pyle. Mr. Turner met him, and he then learnt that both trains had been smashed and that the dead and wounded were lying on the line. "While waiting at Port Talbot three traines-the up passenger train, whicb hame In collision with the down train, a oods train, which followed it, and the express train, which fo.lowed both -were all despatched before it was known at Port Talbot that the down train was so long overdue. [No explanation was given as to how the express train was stopped.] William Chapman, clerk in the locomotive department of the Great WVestern Railway at Stormy, deposed that on the down passenger train arriving at l'yle station he met Mr. White near Pyle. Mr. White said he was going to take the down train down on the up line, and witne5s advised him not to do it on any account, but Mr. Wkite said, " I shall thlegraph, and itwiUllbe all right." Afterwards saw Mr. W hite in the office, with Days and Davy, in the Stormy talegraph office, telegraphing. Witness's inpression was, that .dr. White was taking the train down cin the up line on his own responsibility, and not In pursuance of orders. John Roberts, bead guard of the tip train, arrived at Port Talbot at 11i27 on the day of the accident, and left at 1157. While at the station, having got out the passengers, he asked if he might go on, and Evans said he could not until hIr. Turner came back with the goods' train that had broken down. Ileard the telegraph bell ringint, and Evans said that he and Barney could make nothing of the telegraph. W'itness understood that no mesage was received from Storny in the half-hour while he waited at the station. Heard from Evans that the down traiu was at Stormy, and that Mlr. Turner had telegraphed to them not to send anything down to Port Talbot. There was no message eent, " Where Is dcown passenger trainu?" while he was waibing at the station. Edward Williams, guard of the up goods train detained at Port Talbot, deposed that on arriving at Port Talbot he was told by the policeman that the Irish goods train had broken down, and that he (witness) was to keep clear of the up line, as he expected the down passenger train would be brought on that line down to Port Lralbot. Evans, the clerk, told him he had telegraphed to Stormy, and could make no sense out of them. Mr. Tripp said he did not propose to produce any more witnesses, unless the jury required information on any point. The Forernan of the Jury said that they were satisfied with the evidence that had been brought forward. The Coroner, however, wished to read over the evidence and consider it before he charged the jury, and, after same di cussion, it was arranged to again adjourn the inquest to this morning (Tuesday). Accordingly, to-day, shortly before noon, the jury re. assembled, and the Coroner proceeded with some care to review the evidence that had been adduced in the course of the three days' Inquiry. Two other inquests were opened yesterday at Swansea, before Mr. Collins, coroner for that borough, on the bodies of persons who caame by their deatbs through the same accldent. The names of the deceased are W. Ashman, pork hutcher, of Cardiff, who It will be remembered, was tear. fully mangled about the body and head, and had his skull fractured. He was alive when placed on the train for removal to Swansea Infirmary, but died on the way. The other deceased Is an aged woman, Mrs. Israel, of Pyle, who bad received severe internal injures, as already described in e Tinma, and who died after she had been removed to Swansea. In these cases, after a formal Identification of the body, the inquests wfere adjourned until the olose of the Neath inquest. A representative of the British and Provident Lfe Assurance Soiety, in which offie Mr, Ashman 1 ad insured his life just before the accident, attended this I reliminary inquiry, (BY ELECTRIC ANI INSTERNAIONAL 'IELEGRSAPH.) TEE VERDICT. The jury returned a verdict of " Manslaughter" against Charles White, the station-master at Stormy.
REFORMATOBY SCHOOLS AND STATB OF CRIM!E IS BERKSHIRE. At the Berksbire sessions, which were opened yesterday at Abingdon, before Viscount Barrington, Chairmian; the Right Elon. E. P. Bouverie, M.P.; Mr. J T. Norris, MLP.; Sir R. G.Throckmorton, Dr. Arnould, Mr. Merry, andother magnitrates, an elaborate report on the State of Crime and Reformatory Schools was read by the Rev. J. Field, AA., who has for many years held the office of ohaplain to the dl odel Gaol at Reading, and who is well known as among the first adrocates of that separate imprisonment which his various publications, perhaps more than any other means, have promoted throughout the country. The Rev. Gentleman said,-In my reports of the last two years I had the pleasure of showing that a considerably less number had been committed to your prisons. I am sorry that my statement with reference to the year just completed cannot be equally satisfactory. The statistical statements which I have prepared show an increase of about 60 on the former year, although the number does not exceed the avezage of several preceding years. Various circumstances may account for the increase :-first, the facilities of transit, which have caused a greater Influx of London thieves; next, the return and disbanding of many regiments; but still more, the vigilance and general efficiency of our new police force, which have been evinced particularly in the apprehension of those guilty of petty offences. Hence the fact, which may be in some respects satisfactory, that the increase is found entirely among thoso whose crimes were punished by imprisonment not exceeding one month. Indeed, the last year has been marked by an extraordinary proportion of such offences-only 86- not ten per ceLt. of the entire number of your criminals-having been sentenod to a longer term of punishment than three months. But, whatever sa9isfaction may be derived from the comparatively trifling nature of the offences committed, I revert with regret and painful approhension to the fact that such a large number of evil-dispesed or guilty persons should have been subjeckd to an imprisonment which, while sufficient entirely to destroy their character and to degrade them from their social position, was altogether insufficient for that correctional discipline on which alone we can rely for the prevention of future crimes. Wfith few exceptions, I believe such punishments to be only preparatory to the reconviction of the viotim of this supposed clemency. Allow me, therefore, to repeat my humble protest against a portion of the recent Act for Diminisling Delay and Expense in the Administra. tion of Justice in Certain Cases, which, however plausible in its pretensions, yet, inasmuch as it augments the number of short imprisonments, is truly mischievous in its operation. No returns from other counties enable us to ascertain the number recommitted after punishment under this Act as compared with those sentenced at the court of assize and quarter sessions; but, as respects those of such class recommitted in this aeunty, confining our attention to thcse whose liberation preceded the commencement of the current year, I find the number of the former to be three times greater than that of the latter. Having had the honour to suggest the clause in this Act which invests magistrates with increased discretionary power, I deeply regret that the great advantages derivable from its exercise are frustrated by other provisions. When, through the advocacy of a distinguished member of your hon. bench (Mr. Robert Palmer, M. P.), the clause was inserted which empowered justices, in adjudicating on trifling firs8 offences, to dismiss the case without inflicting punishment, the intention was to lessen the number of short imprisonmerOts,-not by ignuring tle crime, but by suspending the punishment; and that the offence being recorded a cumulative penalty mlgh.t be Imposed if the offender should be again convicted h but sach intention is entirely counteracted by the direotion not to proceed to a conviction when, from any circumstances, It may se n undesirable to inflict punishment,-a direction which precludes any record of the orime, and, sbould the criminal again offend, the utmost penalty then pTovided for the repetition of simple larceny is the insufficient term of t---e months' imprisonment. Anxiety on this subject ind 1 me last week to bring It before the special notice of zhe Association for the Promotion of Social Science, and the recognition of its importance by many members of tli'i society will, I trust, lead to an amendment of the law; b it so desirable an object would be further promoted if it obtrHned the approval and recommendation of this Court. By the tables which I have prepared there is another fact shown to which I beg your attention as oE great Importance. The educational tables exhibit the undiminished proportion of nearly one-third of the most Ignorant classnamely, those unable to read. Now supposing the populatioD of this county 30 years since to have comprised 6O,000 thus totally uninatructed, there cau be little doubt that by charitable exertions, assisted by Government.l grants, the numberofsuch mustnowbereduced,4one-balf. Howimportant, then, such instruction has been must appear from the inference that since the same proportlon of the mast ignorant criminals has continued, had the class from which such were committed remained undiminished, double the actual number would have been convicted. We have, in fact, a double proportion of the untaught, whereas, from the in. creased number of theeducated, the proportion of criminals 's in a corresponding diminished ratio. But this fact is significant in another respect. Ignorance is proverbially the parent of crime, but ignorance alone does not produc It. Crime, like other offspring, has two parents-an agency is provided which acts upon ignorance and begets crime. The | uneducated, having no mental enjoyments, seek their plea- sures in sensuality and excess, and we must expect 'he I crimes they commit to be in proportion to their temptations to such indulgences. We may observe, then, that beerbouses abound where schools are scarce, and I do not hesitate to affirm that these generate crime among our unlettered population to an extent which fully accounts for the increased proportion. Seventy-one juvenile offenders have been convicted during the past year, and of these I regret that only five have been sent to our reformatory schooL These five, with those who preceded them, afford much hope of their permanent amend. ment. But allow me to say that I think the improvement of boyssAubjectedto this judicious treatment may bne still more effectually promoted by a longer term of correctional discipline previously to their removal to the school. This is especiaUy desirable in the case of some who, although young,werevery early addicted to crime, and havebeen reconvicted. The importance to the community of providing for the effective correction of our younger criminals is, indeed, evinced by the number committed of those now forming that class, but it is yet more forcibly shown by a reference to the tino of life when confirmed and oft-convicted offenders entered upon their criminal career. Of this class in your prison during the last year I discovered not less than 66-that is, more than 40 per cent. were under 17 years of age when first committed. During two years preceding the number had been 102, and of these 1-68 had been imlprisoned 924 times, being an averase of 6A to each, lour schoolmasters have performed "heir duties with diligence, and the usual amount of instruction bas been jimparted. As respects other officers of the prison, I have further pleasure in referring to their conduct as showing a high tone of moral and, I trust in the case o several, of truly religious principle. In concluding a report upon your prison discipline and its effects, with which, probably being the last I shall have the privilege of presenting, mythoughtsrecurto the condition and treatment of your criminals when nearly 18 years since you intrusted them to my spiritual care, truly the contrast is such as to excite my '.eartfelt gratitude for the improvement which has taken place. When first I entored upon my labeurs as your prison chaplain I felt disheartened, but sustainedby hope that the justices of this county would not suffer the continuance of a system so shocking in its operation and consequences that it was too truly described by one sent to prison, who was less debased than his companions, " like coming to Hell itself," I determined, rather than desert my post, to represent its condition and strenuously to plead for an entire change of plan. I thank sod the effort was successful. Your investigation and discovery of such malignant evils were the sure earnest of remedial measures. The polluted scene of such enormities was swept away, and with the reconstruction of your prison you substituted a system of discipline, severe, Indeed, as a punishment, but most merciful in Its correctivo agency, Your plan has been admired and imitated in other counties and in other nations ; and I am well convinced that inany from among those whom you have been compelled to imprison do at present, and will for ever, bless you for the result. For myself, although anxious and incessant labour through so many years has dinminished my stiength and rendered me unequal to the performance of duty as heretofore, yet, if obliged to relinquish my office, believe me I shall always cherish a most pleasing remembrance of the encouragement, the courtesy, and the kindness which I have at all ttmes received from the magistracy of this county; and, although I must lament many shortcomings, failures, and faults, still I shall reflect with gratitude that, through d's abloesiang uon the opportunities you have afforded me, may labours have not teen rin vain,
" TELEGRAM" VERSUS " TELEGRAPH." TO THE EDITOR OF TIE TIMES. Sir,'-I am not to be so easily "disposed of" as your correspondent " X" irmagines. The word rfAXe is a preposi. tion as well as an adverb, and often occurs In Homer and elsewhere governing a case, as rjXe wrcirpag. If so (even on " X's" own showing), reXt'yp6ow Is as nauch according to rnle as ri7XEypa0Ew, and then rq\Eypappia, Anglic~ " telegram," follows as a matter of course. I am bound, however, to admit that riXtypaitonpa is better Greek than I thought it; but the common sense and praotical judgment of your readers as to what is short, simple, and serviceable will, I feel cortfident, endorse "telegram" as the better term. The messengers of the Electric Telegraph Companies In Founder's-court and Cornhill would take a week to learn how to pronounce " telegrapheme." I am, Sir, your obedient servant. E.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinglhal-strect, Oct. 20. IN RE SADGROVE AND RAG{: (Bcfore U:. CoMmiSsioncr HOLROYD.) The bankrupts, WiUiam Henry Sadgrove, jun., and Pichard Ragg were upholsterers of Eldon-street, Pinsbhry, and elsewhere. This was the oertificate meeting. Mr. Bagley ,appeared for the assignees and Mr. John More, of No. 5, Market-street, Finsbury; Mfr. Stopher for creditors; r. Lawrence for Sadgrove; and Mr. Pook for Ragg. Mr. BAGLE said the partnership commenced in 1854, when Sadgrove had a capital of 9001. and Ragg 1,060L The returns during the trading had been 191,3911., the profits 15,2221. or 101 per cent., and the expenses 15,5081. or about I1 per cent. In February, 1855, the bankrupts commenced a system which must receive the condemnation of the Court and occadon the total refusal of the certificate of one or both of the bankrupts. In 1855 the bankrupts negotiated accommodation bills to the amount of 8,7221.; in 18a6 to the amount of 2",0001.; and un to February, 1857, a sum making the total aimount 39,3781. according to their own accounts. Of these bils 12,0001. were outstanding at the time of the bankruptcy, and had become proofs against the estate. These bills nad been drawn by the bankrupts either upon parties who proved to have had no existence at all, or who cad no oxistezce as described by the bankrupts. Some of the bills were behl'eved to be purely fictitious; others were upon men of straw, who had no dealings with the bankrupts. Early in the partnership the bankrupts commenced the practice of discounting their customers' bills, and from that circumstance they had afterwards been able to put into circulation ficttioous bills to the amount of about 40,0001., according to their own statement, but which amount was beheved to have been very much larger. Bills to the amount of 20,0001. had been drawn upon one Gardner, the bankrupts' foreman, and 4,000!. of which were out at the time of the bankruptcy. Another batch, to the amount of between 38,0004 and 40,000!., had been drawn upon one James Taylor, in their employ. The way, indeed, was almost laughable in which bills had been drawn upon parties alleged to reside at various places who either did not reside there or did not exist at all, and which bills bore the appearance of trade transactions. These bills were discounted by bankers and others, and his client, Mr. More, had proved against the estate for 2,700!. The bankrupt Ragghad assured Mr. M ore that some of these bills were genuine trade bills, The bankrupts' books had been very badly kept, there being omissions and inaccura_e of the very grossest de. scription. Shortly before the bankruptcy Ragg had pated with his furniture to Gardner, and to Taylor a douceur had been given of 200!. He bad more to say about Ragg than about Sadgrove, Ragg havnn had the management of the fin,ancial department. The C!ourt would, however, decide whether it could make any distinction between the partners in respect to transactions which had been so irregtular, so improper, and so dishonest. A number of bills of exchange were negotiated purporting to be drawn by the bankrupts upon Mr. Barton, Dukestreet Berkeley-square, and accepted by J. Barton; upon Mr. woodman, upholsterer, Torquay, and accepted by George Woodman upon Mr. Burch, Ann-street, Wooiwicb, and accepted by Henry Burchs* upon Mr. Hirons, Middleton-terrace, Maida-hill, and accepted by L. A (MaryAnne) Hirons; upon hlr. Turner, 16a, EEbury-street, Pimnlico, and accepted by Timothy Turner; upon Mr. Pettit, 75, East-. latne, Wdvworth, and accepted by Henry Pettit, and The bankrupt Isgg, examined, said he bad discounted all the bils produced. They were all drawn by him. He knew some of the acceptors-viz,, Turner, Pettit, Buroh, and Barton, but not the others. Did not know whether " the others" were fictitious. Ead no business transactions with them, and he did not draw some of the bills himself. The bill produced upon Woodman, Torquay, was in his own handwriting. Woodman had accepted 20 bills for his accommodation ; in fact, as many as he wanted. He was a poor manliving in London, and did not carry on any business. e (Ragg) had not a room alled " his manufactory," where these bills were made. These were bills drawn upon Air Brown, of Stratford-terrace, who at one time did reside there. He used to draw bills upon Brown 12 months beforehand, as they might be wanted. Brow" also gave verbal authotity to him (bankrupt) to authorize Alfred Wiliam Sadgrove, the nephew of -is partner, to accept bills for him Wrown) for any amount that was wanted. (Laughter.) That authority was aot in writing, and no one was present. Young Mr. Sadgrove did accept bills in Brown's name. He (bankrut) also got two of the younger clerks to accept hills. the name of one of themn was Meycrs. Meyers accepted in the name of Bradley. (A laugh.) Bradley was in existence at the time. The ill produced was drawn upon Thomas Bradley, upholsterer Portsea. Bradley was not hving at Portsea, and he could not %rite, but the bil was accepted in his name. He told Meyers to accept bils hin thateform. Alfredn WlliamaSadgrove and a lad in their service named Black, or Jones, also accepted bills in another name than their own. Bradley was a friend of his. The bi of Brown produced was accepted by young Sad. grove under his directions. It was entirely as an accommodation bill. Nobody was present when Brown authorized him to authorize others to accept bills for hiim (Brown). 12,0001.-worth of this sort of bills was out at the time of the bankruptcy, and he had blank acceptances at the time by him to the further amount of 5,0004 These acceptances were by parties with whoma they had no business transac. tions. Many of the bills discounted by Mr. More were long dated bills-six months. He was not aware that hol told More that his best customers required to be thus drawn Upon. Re-examined.-The bill produced purported to be accepted by Woodman, of Torquay. Did not know of his own knowledge that Woodman ever resided there, but Woodman had told him that he had. Woodman was formerly in his trade, a poor man; now,he believed, holding a situation in the Custom-house. That bill was accepted in their (bankrupW) counting-house. In respect to two other bills producea one accepted in the name of James, and the other of J. J' Brown, both in the same handwriting, he did not know why one was James and the otber J. J. Brown. The acceptance of T. T.Brown was not, he thouoht, in Meyers's handwriting. He thbought bath were in Alfred Sadgrove's writing. Another bill produced as addressed to Mr. Hlrons, 5, lUiddleton-terrace, Taida-hill, was accepted by M. A. lirons; that was by Mary Anne Hirons, Mr. STOIIfIER.-Why address her as "Mr." wlhen her name was Mary Anne ? (Laughter.) The Bankrupt.-She was a friend of mine, and a dressmaker-a married woman. She had been in the employ of their firm at 8s. or 9s. per week, Mr. STorcsE.-Por what amount did she accept bills9 The Bankrupt.-About 2,0001. or so. (Laughter.) Mr. BAGLEY.-I have one here of the lady's for 961. Examination continued.-Bils had been drawn upon Mr. Smith, Veninor, Isle of Wight. He drew the bill produced, but he did not know what many of the bills were when they were drawn, Smith was a person living there; at least he thought so. He had seen Smith. Did not know whether he saw Smith sign the bill. Smith used to give him a dozen at a time. (Laughter.) He believed Smith came from Redcar or Ventnor. Last saw Smith about a year and a-half ago. Never saw him anywhere else but in his (bankrupt's) office. He believed that Smith did at one time or other reside at Redcar or Ventuor with a person named Grant, but h6 never inquired. He very often used to give him a sovereign for 2U accepiances. Had seen Smith only twice in his life. Used to send a lot of bills for his acceptance by post. Mr. STres'nx.-I don't believe that he ever existed. Examination continued.-Only used to slip ihe letter and bills into an envelope. Did not remember that he had Smith's letter, or that it came from the Isle of Wight. The next biUl produced, purporting to be accepted by Turner, of Ebury-street, was accepted by one Turner, a gentleman's servant. He did not know the name of the gentleman whose servant he was. He lived In Grosvenor-place, two or three doors from Tattersalls, and Turner's wife lived in Ebury-street. He had not seen Turner since he stopped paymnent. Turner had accepted bils for him to the amount of some thousands of pounds. He had seen him many and many a time when the family was in town, but did not know the name of the family. Could not account for letters being returned stating that no such persons as Turner was known at the address given on the bills. During the three years he had been In partnership with Sadgrove bills of this kind might have been accepted to the amount of over 100,000!., but he thought not to the extent of 200,0001. The name of Taylor, one of the acceptors, was W. J. Taylor, The bill produced was addressed to him, Moreton-house, hIyde. He was residing in Londen, but his (Taylor's) father had resided at Ryde. Taylor, who was in his employ, had accepted for a good many thousands. (A laugh.) Re-examined by Mr. POOx.-He comimenced discounts with Mr. More in 1847, and they amounted to between 200,0001. and 300,000!. Mr. PoOR;.-Not in one year, surely ? Bankrupt.-No. About 20,0001. a-ear. His charge was about 10 per cent. More never inquired respecting the acceptors or whether such persons were in existence or not. Knows one Alabaster, More's son-in-law, When he (bankrupt) got in difficulties he let Alabaster have some wine at its fair value. auld the amount had been set off against the debt owing to More. During the seven or eight years he bad discounted with More the latter never sustained a single loss by him. He was satisfied with his name upon the bills, and made no inquiry as to the sufficiency of other parties. When he first told Mr. Stephens, who had discounted somne of hiis bills, that the bills were aenommnodation bills, Stephens said, " You had better not itoppaymnent and I will renew them for you again and again2 He (ba ,rUD a ue nrsc A nomtontal" blswr ccommodation hills. All the parties whose names had beexnused had an existence, and they hadsgiven him authority to act, Re-examined.-Mrs. Hirons's hills had been addressed Mr. Hirons, so as to give them the character of trade bills. Hie knew they were accepted by Mrs. Hirons, who had Eeven or eight nwhUdren. Mr. John More, jun., examined, said he was employeDd in his father'scountinghodzse. aggcused to say that hisbest customers gave the long-dated bils and that he had great difuculty t In ettingtherm from the countr,y. Hisfatherws the holder e, 24 of these alleged country and long-dated hills, and which now proved to be acceptances drawn uponx persons in London. Had no reason to believe that the bills were not true bills-honest customers' bills. Cross-examined.--.Was very intimate with e&gg. Dined with him every Sunday, and was accustomed to say that his paer was very good 'paper for "1running off." His father hadl no limit for his discounit, and had never refused to discount the hills which were brought by the bankrupt. Mr. Johln More, son., deposed that he had no reason whatever to suppose that the bimls were not genuine trade bills. The bankrupt used to speak about the difficulty of getting the bills from the country, and say, "ILet there be no mistake about the discount, governor." He had miade minute inquiries of a person who had resided 27 years- at Portsea, and 'he believed no such person as Bradley had ever lived at that place, If he had not had reasons to suppose that the hill were genuine he wouldl not have discounted them; certainly not. Cross-examlned.-Commeneed discounting for the banakrupt eight or nine year ago. Thought he had not discounted his bills since that tine to the amount of 20,000!. or 1.5,000!, a-year; but he might to the extent of 10,0001. a- year. When Pagg joined Sadgrove he had discounted for them. His charge was 10 per cent. Mr. POOK.-Dung the eight years you would have thus received 10,0001. on the discount of 700,0001.? Mr. BAGLEY.-He does not say that tho amount was 100,0001. Crossexamination continued.-He had not refused to take a preference, and he had received such preference. It was not until the assignees found it out that he gave it up. Mlr. Maynard, accountant, deposed to the bankrupts' books having been very irregularly kept. William James Meyers, a youth apparently about 16 years of age, and whose appearance in the character of real Simon Pure, or acceptor of bills of exchange, occasioned a general smile throughout the court, deposed that he was in the service of the bankrupts, his wages being 201. a-year. He ad acepted the bill produced. Ragg told him to sign it. Bagg sad that Mr. Bradley could not write, and he told him to write the name for him. He had done this several times. Never saw Bradley or heard of him except from RBagg. Could not say how many of these bills he had accepted-fouror five. Did not know every person who came into the counting-house. Mr. Bradley might have been there without his seeing him. Mr. BAGL Y.-There is another boy acceptor-the boy Jones. (A laugh.) Frederick George Jones, apparently about 18 years of age, deposed that he was in the service of Sadgrove and Ragg. His wages were first 5s. and then 6s. a vweek. He had accepted bills in the name of "John Gutteridge." Mr. Rasgg told him that Mr. Gutteridge was a gentleman of independent means resident at Norw ood, and so afflicted with aralysis that he could not write. (Laughter.) Alfred adgrtovdeand Ragg wee present at different times when he Alfred Sadgrove, under 22 years of age, but marred, dep osed that he used to accept bills in the name of James Jocn Brown. Accepted the biU produced. Did not know James John Brown. Ragg wished him to sign the name, and said he had Brown's authority for his so doing. Never accepted an bills except in the name of Brown. Accepted the two bills produced, one in the name of James Brown, the other in tne name of James John Brown. Accepted these bills at Ragg's dictation. Did not know whether James and James John Brown was the same person. He was only a servant, and as his employers directed so he did. He might have lost his situation if he had not done so. The bills were accepted payable at the Commercial Bank and Wiliam=, Deacon, and Co's, and when they became due he took the money from Ragg to meet them. Believed moost deoidedly that Ragg had Brown's authority to have his name thus used. Did not know Brown. Mr. BAGLEY submitted that the bill system pursued was one of obtaining money by false pretences, and a mode of coining base money. Public consaderations and the interests of commerce required that such a case, distancing as it did aU others, should be severely punished. It was the duty of this Court to uphold mercantlle honour. Sadgrove had not been eeen to act in the matter. He ought, however, to have known what was passing, and it reauired great faith to believe that he did not know it. Whether the Court could make any distinction between the two was a matter that he must leave to its discietion. It would not be possible to carry on trde, and general involvement must result, if a case like this was not marked with the strongest condemnation. Bundles of letters had been returned, conveying information that no such persons were known as those described, and that the persons were wholly imaginary. Mr. LA%RAXCE called attention to clauses In the part- nership deed, to the effect that Ragg only should sign checks and lhve the management of the finanCIal department. Sadgrove being thus specially restrained could not be held to have been a participator in his partner's errors in finance. Sadgrove had a very latge and valuable business, which he had successfuly carried on for a very long perod with unblemished charaeter. He was inl 1854 joineudhy Rlagg, who had also a high reputation. Sad. grove was to superintend the manufacture and sale, and Ragg the financial department. This division of labour was necessary in a business the returns of which had been 140,000 . Each partner confined himself to his department and there was a clause that speciaUy mentioned that, with the exception of Ragg, no other person than Mr. William Henry Point Sadgrove, the bankrupt's father, should be allowed to interfere. The fact of property worth 1is. in the pound having been given up to the assignees, and which had realized sufficient to pay IOs. in the pound, showed that there had been no Intention, certainly not on the part of Sadgrove, to commit a wrong. Sadgrove's expenditure (8001. a-year), considering that he had a large famUy, was not excessive. During his long career his mercantile bonour had been unimpeached, and he submitted that he was entitled to an immediate certificate. Mr. Poox urged that Mr. More was more culpable than the bankrupt lagg. Forupwrds of eight years he had discounted bills at 10 per cent, and according to his own statement he must thus have realized thereupon 10,0001., but according to the bankrupt'sstatement 20,0001. BuAtfor that drain the bankrupts would have been solvent and the estate have shown a large surplus. The bankrupt's expenditare had been at the rate of only 1001. a-year, and there could have been no reasonable motive for issuing the bills fraudulently. He had only drawn out of the business about onehalf the amount he had put Into it. He would frankly admit that the bankrupt had done wrong, but he had been aided and assisted by the man who now opposed him. His Ho.ou, deferred judgment.
MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Oct. 20. (Before Mr. BLISs, Q.C.) Wiliamn Cavanagh, 42, jeweUer, was indicted for having stolen a gold ring, the property of Thomas WiUilam Eady and another, his masters. He pleaded " Guilty."> The prosecutors are manufacturing jeweUers in Red Lionstreet, Clerkenwell, and the prisoner was in their service. The case against him was that he stole a ring from a drawer in which a fellow-workman kept his work, and sold it at a refiner's shop in Jerusalem-passage for8s. 6d. The prisoner was apprehended near his own house, 36, Augustus-street Cumberland-market, by Tyler, detective officer of the G division. He was intoxicated when taken into custody, and said he knew nothing of the ring. Mr. BLiss said it was a very bad case, and sentenced him to six months' hard labour. E;liraHolden, aged 20, pleaded "'GuiltyV of stealing in the dwelling-house of Elira Harding, her mistress, tw o St.-notes, two sovereigns, a pencil case, be., her property and money hfr. BuTss sentenced her to nine months' hard labour. Several similar cases came before the Conrt. Caroline Deane was indicted for stealing a watch frorn the person of James Crisp. The prosecutor. who lives at No. 8, Wareham-street Hoxton, was in the company of 'he prisoner, a girl of the town, at a coffeeshop In Wenlock.road, and from something which the landlady told him he missed bis watch, which was found in the prisoner's possession She alleged that he had given it to her Instead of money, and that was the defence now set up. The iury Aicquitted her, Mtr. rayne prosecuted; Mr. F. H. Lewis appeared for the prisOner. John Wiliams, 24, was indicted for obtaining goods by false pretences. There were three charges against him, Mr. Platt prosecuted; Mr. Poland appeared for the prisoner. The mode of plunder adopted by the prisoner was this He would go to a tradesman's shop and order goods to be sent to the residence of some person who he had ascertained was a customer, then intercept the errandboy who was sent with the articles, and obtain possession of them by saying he was going back to fetch them, as there had been delay in the delivery, the goods being wanted for immediate use. The jury found him Guily, and he was sentenced to nine months' hard labour. Wiliam Grant and Mary Grant, husband and wife, were indicted for stealing a cash-box, and 261. in gold and siSver the property and money of Edward Charles Battey, propritor of the Duke of Cambridge beershop at Hounslow. Mr. Atkinson prosecuted, and Mr. Payne appeared for the prisoners. The male prisoner belonged to the South Middlesex Miitia, and one night he and his wife slept at the prosecutor's house. A cash-box was stolen from a bedroom, and there was suspicion that the prisoners, or one of them, had soinething to do with it, but the evidence did not amount to sufficient proof, and they were Acqzuitted. Mr. Payne remarked that as the male prisoner wore a Crimean medal it was the more unlikely that he would commit such a theft, and that as he was a volunteer for India it would be much better that he sbould be acquitted and sent to use his muscle and sinew against the miscreant Sepoys than shut up for no good at ali in a prison. (Bcfore hfr. CREAtSY.) RoberttBaker 44, was indicted for unlawfully and indecently assaulting Eliza Winterflood, with intent, &c, Mr. Sleigh appeared for the prosecution. This case was prosecuted by Mr. Vann, vestry clerk of Shoreditch, under the direction of the authorities of that parish, the offence with which the prisoner was charged having been committed in their workhouse. The prisoner was a pauper inmate, and was occasionally employed as a watchman. It appeared that the prosecntrix, a girl about 12 years of age, whose parents live in Charlotte-row, Angelalley, Bishopogate, committed a petty theft and ran away, and, being too frightened to go home, she wandered about the streets until she was taken by a policeman to Shoreditch Workhouse for the uight. The prisoner opened the gate and the policeman left her in his charge; he took her to a dark place and committed the offence imputed io him, after which he conducted her to a ward and left her with a nurse. She did not then complain of what had occurred, because she Paid the prisoner had threatened to flog her if she did, but on being taken home next morning she immediately told her mother, and on being taken back to the workhouse she singled the prisoner out from seven other men. l'he jury found him aGuilty, and Mr. G,RESY sentenced hima to 10 months' hard labour. It was a very proper case for the parish to prosecute. Frederick :ock, 23, sailor, was indicted for unlawfully and maliciously assaulting and wounding Charles Smith. r.Honey prosecuted; Mr. Sleigh appeared for the priThe prosecutor was a saUor, and a dispute arose between imn and the prisoner and two of his mates. The prisoner applied a particular epithet to the prosecutor's wife, and they had a fight. While they were preparing for a second round the prisoner ran up to the prosecutor and stabbed him in the arm and ran away. Theljury found him Gitily, and Mr. UREASY sentenced him to four months' hard labour. Willam Smith, 31. was indicted for unlawfUlly assault- ing and beating Johni Hewett. . Sleigh prosecuted. The prosecutor stated that he lived at 84, Drummondstreet, St. Paneras, and was an officer of the Bloomsbary CountyCourt. On the 17th inst.,about half-past 10 oelcck in the evening, he went to 21., BriU-row, Somers-town, to serve the prioner with a judgment summons. He went to aroom on the first 'door occupied by the prisoner, knocked, and the prisoner opened the door. He told him that be had to serve him 'with a judgment sunmons at the suit of Paine and gave him the document. The prisoner sid he dia not owe the money, and that he had a good mind to throw him downstairs. He told him not to do that, as he wu only doing that which was his duty; but as he turned to descend the staircase the prisoner pushed him from behind and he fell down 13 stairs, injuring his head and back. He had been unable to resume his daty in consequence, and could now walk but at the rate of one mile an hour, whereas before he was injured he could walk from four to five. The prisoner said he did not do It wilfully. The jury found him GuiUy, and Mr. Cnn&sy sentenced him to six mouths' hard labour. Ellen Ward, 20 was indicted for stealing four sovereigns, the moneys of Josephine Hammett and a book and other articles the property of Henry and Eiiza Jane Atterbury, Mr. Sleighl (instructed by Mess. Iulens) appeared for the proseation o Josephuae EIa;nmett, of No. 2, Caroline-street, Bedford. square, stated that she had the care of a house belonginP to Mr. Atterbary, of No. 14, Pembroke-terrace, Caledonan. road, where the prisoner was employed Ls servant. A gentleman also lodged there, but he only slept there oCCasionally. His bedroom was on the ground floor, and witness's was on the first floor, and no one but the gentleman, herself, and the prisoner had access to the rooms. On Saturday, the 12th of September,- the witness missed four sovereigns from a drawer in her room, which had been seen safe a short time before. On the night of the 12th of Sep. tember she went out for about two hours. Jane Atterbury said she had engaged the prisoner as eer Vanttto her brother, as she represented that she wanted to get into a place, as she had not much money and could not afford to pay for a lodging. She said that her late mistress was out of town, or she oould have produced a good character, and in consequence she was taken into the service without a character. Edward Silverlock, of No. 3, Norfolk-place, Lower-road, Islington, linendraper, proved that on the evening of the 12th of September the prlsoner came to his shop and purchased articles to the amount of 31. It was further proved that on the prisoner being searched at the station-house some stolen articles were found secreted on her pieron. The jury immediately found the prisoner Guiy. Mr. Sleigh said there was another indictment against theprisoner for stealing one sovereign, &a., the property of Miss Atterbury, but he said he should not proceod with it. Mfr. CRXAsy said the sovereign might have been t-aken at the sme tire as the articles named In the first indiotment, and therefore he should treat this as a first offence, as he found no other conviction against her in the return before him. He then sentenced her to imprisonment and hard labour for three months. Augusts KInlan, 30, hawker, was indicted for stealin two beds and other artieles, valueo I0, the property of Joseph Muskett Yetts and others. It appeared from the evidence that the prosecutor is a solicitor, residing at Homerton, and he is also the owner of a mushed cottage adjacent to his house, in which his aervants slept. On the nfght of the 9th inst., at about 10 o'clock, on the servants going to their apartments as usual for the night, they found that two feather beds, three cotton dresses, and other articles, value 10., the property of the prosecutor and the servants in his employ,hadbeen taken away. Upon the discovery of the robbery the matter was at once put into the hands of the police, and from information they received they went to the house of the prisoner, who lived in the neighbourhood, and there found the whole of the stolen property. The prisoner said he bought it of a mnan whom he did 'not know, but had frequently seen him at miarket at Old Ford. The day he named as that on which he had bought them was previous to the commission of the robbery. The jury found the prlsonertGuilly and Mr. CREASY sentenced him to hard labour for six months. With respect to the case of William Smith, mentioned above, at a subsequent part of the day the wife of the prisoner complained to the Court that she had paid a solicitor, Mr. John Pater, of 33 Argyle-square, a suLm of money for the purpose of obtaiang counsel to defend her husband but ne had not appeared at the tria and the prisoner was consequently undefended, Mr. Pater, who was in court, protested "upon the honour of a gentleman" that he had been taken by sarprise, and wished the case to be re-heard. Mr. CBEASY, the presiding judge, told him not to talk to him about the "honour of a gentleman;" or he should have to sAy something he might not wish to hear, for it was quite clear that he had taken the woman's money, and yet the man had bean tried without counsel. Mr. Pater then wished to address the jury, but Mr. CRx&sY imper-stively ordered him to quit the court, or he would commit him, and instracted the prisoner's wife to put the case into the hands of the county solicitor.
POLICE, O Un A&LL-John Williams, an emaciated and miser. able-looking man, about 30 years of age, was charged With stealing a set of letter scales and weights, three coats, and other articles, the property of Mr. B. Muggeridge. from 27, St. Andrew's-hill; also with stealing 141b. of loaf sugar and Olb. of coffee, the property of Messis. Copstake and Co. ; and a silk mantle and other articles, tho property of Isabella Holloway, from 28, St. Andrew's-hilL The prlsouer was further charged with burglariously brealing out of the lastnamed premises on the nght of Thursday, the 15th inst. Policeman 64 B said, in consequence of information, he went to a house in George-Street, St. Giles's, and found the prisoner in the kitchen with several other persons. The prisoner had all the property mentioned in the eharge by his side with the exception of one of the coats, which he had on, and a number of small articles concealed in the pockets of the coat. He accounted for the clothing by saying he bought it in Petticoat.lane, and the scales he said he brought from California, where he had used them for weighing gold. The prisoner had a skeleton key in his possession when taken Into custody. William Colis, foreman to Messra. H. and E. Mfuggeridge, of A.Andrew's-hill, said he locked up the premises on the night of Thursday, the 15th inst., and when he came in the morning he found the doors outside all safe, but his own desk had been broken open and several of the articles produced taken from it. The counting-house, communicatine by an open window, had also been visited, and the coats and other property belonging to Mr. Benjamin Muggeridge taken away. In the yard was a ladder against the wall leading into the window of the adjoining premises of Messrs. Copestake and Co., from which place the coffee and sugar had been taken. It further appeared that some person must have been concealed during the day, and the back part of the premises being open facilitated the operations of the thieves, who were, howvever, obliged to go out by the front door to get clear off with their booty Nearly the wfhole of the property w as identified, and the prisoner was then remanded for further inquiry. BoW-SmmExr.-George Berrington, D.D., formerly a clergyman of the church of England, but now a ticket-ofleave man, was brought up on a warrant issued a few days ago by Mr. HaLL, to be recommitted for the remainder of the term of his original sentence. That sentence was passed at Lewes on the 1st of December, 1852, when Berrington was condenmed to seven years' transportation. At that time he had acquired considerable notorety for the extent and ingenuity of his frauds. The offence of which he was convicted was that of obtaining a sum of 201. by falee pretences from a young lady named Ilichardson, who had oeen attracted to apply to him for an engagement as governess by an advertisement in which he described himself as a " clergyman about to proceed with his family to Australia, in his own vesseL" He engaged her at a liberal salary, and obtained the 201. from her on the pretence of laying it out to advantage. Of course the ship, the intended voyage, the salary, and the investment were equally fictitious, and the handsomely furnished villa in which applicants were received (at Rottingdean, near Brighten) had been furnished upon credit, without the slightest intention of payment. After serving three years and four months, nearly half the term of his sentence, he obtained his ticket of leave in April, 1856. Lately it was ascertained that he was living by victimizing tradesmen, but had taken care not to render himself liable to criminal proceedings. This, however. was sufficient to justify the revocation of his license and the issue of the warrant for his apprehension. The constables invested with the warrant (Gymer, rS4 F, and Mason, 25 S) first sought him at a villa at Holloway, whereBerrington had for some time been residing, but found that he had suddenly disappeared, as the tradesmen with whom he had run in debt were beginning to open their e es to his true character, and were becoming troublesome. had left in possession his son and daughter, who, of course, refused to give any clue to his whereabouts. The officers then resorted to the following ruse :- -They sent Ito the house one of the lads of the Electric Telegraph Company in his uniform. The messenger pretended that he had a telegraphic despatch for the Rev. Dr. Berrington, which must be delivered at once, and into his own hands. So earnestly did he press the matter that the prisoner's son was at last Induced to take the boy to his father. The officers followed at a distance, and thus discovered the prisoner's retreat, in Mabledon-terrace, Burtoncrescent. They found him enjoying his pipe, and with a bottle of gin by his side. A lady was in the room, in her night-dress, and expressed herself much shocked at the intrusion of the constables. Berrington admitted his identity, and suffered himself to be taken without resist. ance. On the question being put by the Magistrate whetber the prisoner had anything to say why he should not be recommitted, His counsel, Mr. Sturgeon, said that it was impossible for him to show cause, as he was not aware on what grounds he was recommitted. It was not stated in the warrant. Mr. HALL said it was not necessary. The license, however, did set forth the several grounds on which it might be revoked, so that the holder was fuUy warned of the consequences of any breach of the conditions on which it was granted. At all events; he (Mr. Hall) could not entertain any question as to the grounds of recommitment, as he had but one duty to perform, and no option. The prisonermust be committed for the remainder of his term. Wi,ih respect to the recent seizures in Holywellstreet, It will be remembered that Mr. Jardine gave judgment on the 13th inst. that certain of the books, &.k, were obscene, and ordered them to be destroyed, subject to a delay of seven days in case of appeal, and also subject to the discretion of the Government as to retaining any portion of them to be produced in evidence in any future proceed- The period of seven days expired yesterday, one only of the defendants having given notice of appeal, This was JamesThorhil],of 5, Holwelltreetwho towtnderedI the required ba, The sureties, William Palmer, of West- s t re e t , S ft . a rt i 'snlx a nze s* >te re o ty p ce f o u n d e r, a n d T h o m a s Clar, o th CrokedBilet, n Wch-tret, were bound in 501. each, and the appellant In 1001, MAYLEBOE.-The court was crowded to excess in consequence of a report which appe red in our paper of yesterday of the examination of lMr. John Probert, a wealthy farmer at Llanfelly, Abergaveuny, wvho on the previous day wfas charged with having been concerned with another lxi stealing property to the amount of 1001. f rom the Londonstreet, I'addni4n'o buIness in r.Grrannge attended, as sbefore for the prosecution; and It wil he remuembered that the robbery took place on the Mr. Herringt addressed the mnagistrate atasome longtha an with much abilit with regard to the pemuijar facts in connexion with the case, and sid that as soon as poaible after his client was given in charge a telegraphic communication was made to his wife, informing her that her husband was in custody en a chaige of robbery, and requiring her to send up to London instantcr such persons as gould be able to prove beyond a doubt that he (prisoner) could not have had any knowledge of or participation in the abstraction of the jewelry and watches said to have been stolen on the day alluded to (the 3d inst.).

Ir. BROUG11ToX.-Whom do you first call? Mr. lerring.-Ili first put in the box, Sir, a highly respectable tradesman. George Price ws then sworn. Mr.kierring.-Wbee do you reside, and what are you? Mr. Herring.-you are a grocer and a butcher, are you Witness.-I am, Sir writ errineg.-Have you known the prisoner long? Mr. Herring.- What is he r Witness.-He is a farmer. Mr. Herring.-How long bave yon known him ? Witness.-About five years. Mr. Herring.-What opinion have you formed of his character ? Witness.-His character is in every respect unexceptionable. Mr. Herring.-Has he held any publio office in your parish ? Witness.-Yes, Sir, that of a road surveyor. Mr. Herring.-An; othert-At this time, Sir, he is a collector of land and asessed taxes. Mr. Herring.-Now, as to his moral character what do you say? Witness.-I never knew a stain cast rnon it. He con. stantly attends with his family at the parish church, and a more respectable and well-conducted man does not, I believe, exis. In reply ito furtber questions the witness said,-I called upon the prisoner at his house on the 2d of this month, at 11 in the morning, and on the next day, the 3d, between 8 and 10. I saw the prisoner going along with a number of sheep to a field called the "I Hentld=" (on the very morn. Ing the robbery, as alleged, took place), and I spoke to him, Pror to my going into business I was gardener to the Ven. Archdeacon Williams, now Dean of Llaudaff. The defenr dant is a wealthy man, and has a very extensive stock. Mr. B5ROUG51Toi.-When did you first know of the prisoner being in custody ? Witness.-Yesterday morning, Sir, between 5 and 6 o'clock. MD, Herrlng.-Dld you start immediately for London? Witnes.- did, and arrived in London last night at 6. By Mr. Grange.-I came up at the instigation of Mrs. Probert, the prisoner's wife, to whom the telegraphic message had been sent. I had not received any message from Mr. Herring. The next witness ws Henry Evans, whio said-I have been in the employ of the prisoner since the 5th ) f Jane last. sr. Herring.-Do you recollect the evening. just.?1 Witness.-I do, Sir; on that day I made cyder -or my master, and at 9 in the evening my master sat down to smoke his pipe. He said to me, " Henry, will you have a pint of cyder?" and I said, " Yes, Sir, if you please." Mr Herring.-Did you see him the next morning ? Witness.-I did, at 9 o'clock. MIr. BROUGHTON.-How do you know the time you have sworn to? Witness.-I know it well, Sir * know when the Fast day was, and that it was on the 7th. I am certain it was three days before that. Caroline Ltoyd, said,-I have been in the service of Mr. Probert (the prisoner) since the last Monday in July. Mr. Herring.-Daring that time, up to last Wednesday, have you seen your master at home? Witness.-Yes; he has slept in the house every night, atd I have seen him after he got unD the next morning. Mr. BROUGHTnO.-When did you first hear of your master being charged ? Wltness.-Not LiII the message came by telegraph to my mistress. Mr. Grange.-When did your master leave home to come to London? Witness.-Last Wednesday. A letter from the rector of the parish in which the prisoner dwells was handed to the worthy magistrate. It was highly favourable with regard to the character of the accused - in fact a better testimonial asto moral worth and respectaole stanimg could not have been given to any one. Mr. Grange, for the prosecution, said, that he really could not hold out, nor would he attempt to do so, agaix,st the evidence in favour of the prisoner which had been adduced. There was no ,indictive feeling in connexion with the prisoner being charged, and he would not have been taken to the station-house if the servant girl had not spoken positively as to his identity. Mr. Herrlng. in an able address, contended that an aZibi had been clearly made out, and that his client was entitled to an honourable acquittaL Mr.BRouoGxoN, after many remarks upon the case, came to the condusion that an atibi had been clearly and satiafactorily established, and he should therefore discharge the prisoner. Mr. Stradtht from whom the valuable property had been stolen, now said that from what he had heard while in court he was convincead that the person accused was innocent; his servant ve him into custody herself, being quite satisfied at tne priod of her doing so that she coul not be mistaken; he (hr. Stradth) had been threatened with an action, but he could not imagine how any action could be brought against hlm, inasmuch as his servant gave the accnsed in charge herself, being quite sure at the time she did so that she was acting perfectly right. Mr. Herring.-With regard to the threatened action you speak of, you will very likely find that the intimation which you have received thereof will turn out to be no joke. Mr. Frobert with a laember of his most respectable friends then left the court. LIxBxTEr.-Mrs. Susan Hamby was further examined before Mr. ELLorIT on a charge of passing three notes, two for 51., and one for 101., well knowing the same to be forged. On the former examination only one charge was known against the prisoner, and that was for passing a 10I.-note to 3Mr. Toby, boot and shoe manufacturer, in Wellingtonstreet, London-bridge, and by the evidence it appeared that the prisoner gave anuorder to the prosecutor for boots and shoes amounting to 101. 4s., requesting them to bes ent to a houseein Cambridge-terrace, Wandsworth-road, where she said she was about to open a shop, and on the goods being delivered gave a forged 101-note m payment. Yesterday in addition it was proved in evidence that the prisoner gave an order at a draper's shop in King WilLIam-street, London-bridge, for goods amounting to 51. 7s. 33d., and on their being sent to Cambridge-terrace, she gave a 51. forged note in payment, and in a day or two afterwards it was found that the house was deserted, and that, in fact, it bad been merely taken for the purpose of receiving the goods and passing off the two forged notes. A third charge was preferred against the prisoner by Mr. Turner, landlord of the Globe publichouse, Regent-street, Lambeth-walk, who deposed that on Thursday week the prisoner came to his house and asked him for change for a o1.- note, which sbe handed to him. On looking at it he said he thought it was a bad one, but the prisoner assured him that it was not, as her father had received it at Somersethouse. The prisoner at that time was a stranger to him, but she said she was the daughter of Mr. Finch, who lived at No. 5, Gray's-place, in the neighbourhood, and that her father and family had dealt at the house for years. On this representation he said he should give her the change, and told her to write her name and address at the back. She said she could not write, but requested him (Mr. Turner) to do so, and after marking it with the prisoner's name and address he gavo her change. He subsequently passed it to his brewer, and it was returned stamped *' Forgery." The w,itness added that after the note was returned he made inquiries, and found that the prisoner's father resided where she stated, and he (the father) had acknowledged to having sent his daughter with the note, but said he did not think at the time that it was a forgery. The father also offered to return the 51. provided witness did not appear against his daughter, but witness felt it to be his duty to attend. Mr. Joseph Bumsted, inspector of banknotes at the Bank of Eugland, pronounced all the three notes produced to be forgeries, and expresed it as his opinion that they were all of the same manufacture. The prisoner was committed for trial on each of the three charges, but as it was represented that she answered the description of a personwho, in connexion with a man ramed Stephens, had paseed several other notes of a similar descriptlon, she was remanded until Monday next. The following donations, received on 1behalf of John Hugill, the poor old man the distressing account of whom appearedin The Times on l$aturday last, were requested by h1r.

RAIKES' DIARY.* Again we are taken into the conG-hlence of Thomas Raikes, Esq. Two further, and e's we assume fin1l,: volumes of his Diary, containin', such portions of it as ihis editors have judlciou 4y selected, bring us i down from the middle of '3V' to the commencement of '47. Dturing this nlter val he was ordinarily a resident in Paris, but he. varied his sgjmir in that capital by occasionally (rossing over to Eugland anxd by some continental e- 'cursions. Otherwise he wss still in "society," atill mingling with the grand 'jibris of political aD d fashionable life, and still able to watch the iniacbiLnery-the ropes an;d pulleys-by which the world 's operated upon fromn above and behind the scemB ,a. At firt we thought these voluTrees in.ferior to thi'.s predecemsors, but as we read on we. altcred onr -ep9nion. They contain a less proportiont Df stories we have heard before azid a larger propcrtion -of statements which more nearly coneern uls, ineas.ch as they connect themselves with re-nihusCn.es which are less stale and with reputations les remote than those of the eass of the Reform PX1L Moreover, while Mr. Raikes's opportunitios were not abridged, it is singutlar to observe 'thatizds views expanded as he grew older. We shall refer to this phenomenon more closely before we corclude our remarks, but for the present almost the only treatment these volumes admit is to give -somo account of their miscellaneous contents. ioesidiug at Paris from '36 to '47, it was natural that Mr. Rai!:es should comment on a variety of incidlents which still sound familiarly enough to most of us. The faetions, the diffieulties, and intrigues which surrounded the throne of Louis Philippe, the series of attempts to assassinate him, the questions of the fortifications of Paris, of the Syrian demonstration, and of the Spanish marriages; General Evans and the Carlists in Spain, the Duo de Bordeaux in England, Louis Napoleon at Boulogne and Strasburg, with such secondary performers as Mrs. Norton, Abd-ei-Kader, Madame Laffarge, and the Duke of Brunswick, together obtain a large share of Mr. Ralikes's observations. He narrates how he was first to communicate to the Dulke of Wellington the accidental death of the Duo d'Orleans, and how they discussed in comrmon its consequences to the dynasty of Louis Philippe. Also he tells us how he went to the Variet6s to see the "Kean" of Alexandre Dumas, and that the writer showed a profound ignorance of the usages of English life. There the English actor is made the intimate friend of the Prince of Vales, and his rival in the affections of the Court beauties; but Thomas Raikes omits to mention the catastrophe, w-hich, if we remember rightly, is so truly Britannic, where the Prince banishes the great Edmund witlh some such sentence as. "Jc vous deporte aiox clonises puuir us an." On several of these topics, however, MIr. Raikes communicates particulars that are both novel and interesting. Ilis own curiosity was evidently excited by the relations of his friend Montrond withLouis Philippe, and the question of the services which that wily potentate, who used everybody that he could use, must have exacted in return for his outlay of cash and )etits suins. A characteristic portrait of Montrond, by D'Orsay, is prefixed to the fourth volume, where we see his egg-shaped cranium concentrating its attention upon trumps. Mlontrond, who dies in this volume, page 322, in the odeur de saintetM, gives a final explanation or key to his own career. The Abbe Petitot, who has come to shrive him in preparation for the " last trump," which he bad somewhat disregarded while the play was otherwise brisk, said to him attheir first interview, -" Vous avez sans doute dans votre temps fait beaucoup de plaisanteries contre la religion." "Non," replied-Montrond, "j'aitoujours vecu en bonne compagnie." A wortly who lived in such company so invariably was likely, of course, to see and hear circumstances worth narrating, and possibly some which it was well worth tho time of Louis Philippe to lidten to. At all events, Mr. Raikes need not have been so surprised at the circumstance which follows, nor his editors so unnecessarily dark as to the party referred to. " Sunday, 9th.- Thero is some mystery abotut the infla ence which - decidedly has over Louis Philippe; he is in possession of sonme secret or Ppaers vhich might seriously in plicate the interests of E. 1, who is therefore anxious to secuire his goodwill by benefits and attentions of no common order. The pension which he enjoys from the privy purse is far more considerable than people imagine ; he has 487,Ofr. a-year, paid quarterly, and occasional donations from the same source of 12,0OfOr., at atime, Nvhenhea 1plies for it. The othor day, when the marriage of the I u o of Orleans was finally concluded, the king sent for Prince Talloyrand, and desired hini to go forthwith to - and announce to him the evont. The old Princo obeyed the command, and sras lifted up by his two footmen to -'s apartment, where he delivered the message. - called for pen, ink, and paper, and immediately wrote a letter of congratulation to the King, who that very day retorned himi an answer i, his oan handwri'uing, to thank him for the interest which he evinced in the welfare of his family. Now, this from a king to a subject may be deermed an extraordinary condescension, and has created much conimenm among the few who have had opportunities of knowing it. " Both are wily characters, and ready to spare each other for thoir own privato interests. It is supposed that - is in poEsession of certain letters written many years ago by Louis Philippe when In Sicily, which prove the underhand part he even then was acting to supplant the elder branch of the Bourbons, and porliaps of others relating to schemes of the like nature, though of more recent date. - was violent in his abuse of Louis Philippe when he canie to the throne in 1i,30, but the means of pacifying him were soon found." The long intimacy of 50 years between Montrond sad Talleyrand is accounted for much more reasonably. "M. de Talleyrand ne so plait plus quo dans la conversatnOU de ce ,fdi's Achates, gui a fait pendant quarante ans assaut d'opigramn, es et de roucries avec lui, et cC deux grandi dbri-s se coasoflcie c7ar ensx. Si l'on veut savoir le secret de la liaison de ce deux homrmes, qui s'estiment et se connoisent, on le trouvera dans les deux mots suivant. " hL do Tallcyrand disolt un soir dans les Gpanchements de l'intiuljt6, 'lu)lnesse de Laval, savez vous pourquoi j'aime assez Montroid ? C'est parceqlu'il n'a psa beanconp -de pijeg6S.' Moutrend r6pliqua aussltut: 'Duchesse de Luynes, -avez vous pourquoi j'aimoe M. de Talleyrand? C'est qu'il n'en a pas di tout.'" At the last appearance of Mlontrond, prior to his subjugation by the Abbe Petitot, lie has become thin aud emaciated, leans on a stick for support and wears green spectacles. " Soleie one wishing to be agreeable, said to him to-day at dinner, 'Je vons troutv e bon iisaoe av,cosurd'hu-i.' Hisreply was, 'lVa foi, ss sib-Xs post'iiflirils.' M. doeTallyrand, also, on a tradesman asking hisim when he vould pay him, said, MAtJai, rtis9 es hie-n ri"eix- !"' As we have referred to the resemblances and close -connexion of these two personages, we wvill now turn to the greater and more famous of the two, who came to his end some three or four years earlier. Tarieyrand was very anxious to make a -speech at the Academy, which he had been at some pains in preparing,-in sbort, of 'making his last adieui to the academicians, and he went through the oxertion at some risk in his then -enfeebled health. " His speech," says Mr. Raikes, vwas so warmly panegyrized by the little court which surrounds him that he was induced to print and publish it." Alas ! it turned out to be a composition savouring of the qualities which Gil Blas remarked in thn -ermon of the Archbishop. Two months later, on the lth of May, 183S, Mr. Raikes has to -nalke the entry that "This day, at 4 o'clock, Prince Talloyrand died." "It would seeon that the priest, who arrived on Tuesday mornlig, was sent for privately by Mademoiselle Pauline Perigord, the daughter of Madame de Din,, but the dying man would have no comnunication with him, and refused -the consolations of religion. The priest thlerefore took up his pest in the ante-room, awaiting a favourahlo turn in his sentiments.

A t the appointed time he received the AbbW Dapanloup and other friends, in whose presence he nm-de confession, and a formal recantation of his errors ; after which he received tbs holy Sacrament. He undersigned twot letters, one to tho:!'ope, the other to the Archbishop of Piris, professing his faith. His recantation 'vas read aloud to the company by AhOamane do Dino "The Ki;ng and bladame Adelaide paid him a visit at half-past S, when he remarked that thrw individuals in the room had never been presented- namely, the two physicians and the valet de ohamubre, whom he fosmally introduced as a matter of etiquette, thus adlering to wordly forms to the Last. In thsLt room must have been assembled individuals whose real feelings at such a scene, coald they have been aid open to public view, would have 2'oruied a curious subject ofspeculation. The Prince throughoutahis closin' scene, though suffering much bodily pain fr'om hic disorder. showed great firmness and composure.

It was ir, miniature the scene of the death of the old kiugs of Fraav5e. He died in public. The lit rary adjoining the Prinoe's bedroom, and from which it was only eaparated by a pactiere or curtain, was constantly filled with servants and dependanas. Frequently one of them wouid draw backtfhe curtain when unobserved, saying to those in atteudance, IVoyons a-i-il signe ?

M. do Talleyraud,had'been so often ill, and bad so often recovered, that even at his age of 8l he would not believe that his case was hopeless. On this account he eo long persisted in refusing to sign his recantation, or to receive a priest, being determined not to make this public avowal of & religious feeling little in tenor with his past life til he was absolutoly on the point of quitting it. 1' It was a perseverance in the dread of public opinion to the last hour which was fearful. At the moment when he was summoned into the presence of his God he seemed more anxious to avoid the scoffs of the world in caee of his recovery, which was impossible, than to mnake his peace with Heaven-before that tribunal where his appearance must be immediate and inevitable. His acquiescence at last was only obtained by the entreaties of the little Pauline,* who told him if he deferred his signatnre she should feel miserable for the rest of her life. The comments of the world on his death are, as may be supposed, various. The Legitirnists say, 'II est mort en bon gentill homme.' A lady of the viecile cou- said last night in my hearing, 'Enfin iI est mort en homme qui sait vivre.' And M. de Elanomesnil said, ' Apres avoir roue tout le monds, il a voulu finir par rotter le bon Dieu."' Mr. Raikes informs us that there was a deliberation in the Council as to the propriety of seizing the Prince's private papers, but probably the news that he had deposited them in England stopped this act of injustice. Where or with whom they are deposited Mr. Raikes does not communicate ; in fact, he elsewhere speaks of this circumstance as a rumour. But he adds the information which was generally current at the time ofj Talleyrand's death, that the declaration attached to his will contained the strictest prohibition to his heirs from publishing his memoirs till 30 years after the day of his death. The date when this prohibition will determine will be May, 1808, at which date the world may, or may not, be gratified with the harvest of scandals which it reasonably anticipates. Mr. Raikes walked in the crowcd at Talleyrand's funeral, and listened to the 'earious sarcastic comments on the occasion. When the funeral cortege deviated from the line previously announced the disappointed spectators cried out, "Voyez donc, il noustrompe meime en mourant.." The device "Rien quoe Dieu," which ornamented his catafalque was of course too suggestive of odious comparisons to escape notice. Mr. Raikesgivesanaccountof Talleyrand's kitchen, which w as modelled upon that of the old French noblesse before the Revolution. It included four cheefs, the r otiaseur, the saucier, the patissier,and the oficier, the latter superintending the dessert, the ices, asd the confitures. Ten men were regularly employed in producing his dinner, and his was the only regular table of the old school kept up in France, partly from the rarity of such an immense fortune, and partly from the indifference which Mr. R3ikes reprobates, to the culinary refinements of a courtly age. From other particulars which he gives of Talleyrand's character and habits, and the estimation in which he was held, we extract the following consecutive passages, as containinc, varoiis observations of interest. a "The foUowing character of Talleyrand, evidently written by one acquainted with him in England, has appeared in the lIorntng Yost, and is worthy of remark *- ` ' Talleyrand is cortainly the most extraordinary being of his kind the world has produced since the creation. Take him in his physical conformation alone, and think of his having outlived so long all the great and good of his timne. "' ;Talleyrand was born lame, and his limbs are fastened to his trunk by an iron apparatus, on which he strikes ever and anon his gigantic cane, to the great disma7 of those who see him for the first time-an awe not diminished by the look of his piercing gray eyes, peering through his shaggy eyebrows, his unearthly faee, marked with deep stains, covered partly by hls shock of extraordinary hair, partly by his enormous muslin cravat, which suDports a large protruding lip drawn over his upper lip, with a cynical expression no painting could render ; add to this apparatus of terror his dead silence, broken occasionally by the most sepulchral guttural monosyllables. Talleyrand's pulse, wthich rolls a streamn oi enormous volume, intermits and pauses at every sixth beat. This he constantly points out triumphantly as a tlst of nature, giving him at once a superiority over otbermen. Thus he says all the missing pulsations are added to the sum total of those of his whole lfe, and his longevity and strenoth appear to support this extraordinary theory. Ho likewise asserts that it is this which enables him to do without sleep. Nature, says he, sleeps and recruits herself at every intermission of my puls3. And indeed you see him time after time rise at 3 o'clock in the morning from the whist table, then return home and often wake up one of his secretaries to keep him company or to talk of business. "'At 4 he will go to bed. sitting nearly bolt upright in his bed, with innumerable nightcaps on his head to keep it warm, as lie said, and feed his intellect with blood, but in fact to prevent his injuring the seat of knowledge if he tumbles on the ground; and he sits upright from bis tendency to apoplexy, which would no doubt seize him if perfeetly recumbent.t We may remember the newspapers stating he was found a few years ago, his head having dropped fromn his pillow, so drowned in blood that not a feature was to be seen. Although he goes to bed so late, at 6 or 7 at latest he wakes and sends for his attendants. He constantly refers to the period when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, and when his power to live without sleep enabled him to go out and seek information as well as pleasure in society till 12 or 1 o'clock. At that hoer he returned to his office, read over all the letters that had arrived in the dav, put marginal indications of the answers to be given, and then on waking ahi t 6s read over all the letters written in consequence " ' When TalUeyrand was engaged in the protocols herei he used to tire out all his younger colleagues; and fnUl well we know by experience that at the time of the Quadruple Treaty and on many other occasions his eyes were wide open while Lord Palmerston slept. When the storm of the three glorie-uscs broke over Paris, too happy to escape from France, TaUeyrand came over to England. One cannot refrain from laughing on thinking how he appeared then. He gave his audiences to his countrymen in his salon in Hanover-square with a round hat on his head, on the front of which was a tri-coloured cockade six inches square - while lying tout au long on the sofas were three young saes- I culottes of July he had brought with him to give himself an air of Republicanism. Louis Philippe got settled on his throne, the tricoloured cockade was torn off the round hat and thrown into the fire, and the new-born embryos of Republicanism were sent back to Paris Talloyrand, freed from all fear of tho Republic, gave vent to all his natural despotism. He then had here the whole world at his feet; all the nobility of England sought his society with eagerness; the diploinatists of every nation bowed before him. Lord Palmerston alone resisted Talleyrand, not only in great things, but in the most trifling and childish affairs. Talleyrand then used to settle affairs beforehand with Lord Grey and Lord Holland. Lord Palmerston managed, however, to annoy Talleyrand, who, tired of bickeriDg on trifles, and doubtful what turni affairs would take as regarded the two parties In the State, with both of which he wished to keep on good ternis,-Talleyrand, we repeat, took the first opportunity of going on leave to France, from whence he gave in his resignation. All we shall add further is, that Talleyrand is not a man of imagination nor of invention. He never could make an extempore speech in his life. His forte is his impassability and his cool and perfect judgment. He iR very silent, and is always stimulating those who approach him to talk on the important subjects of the day. He will listen for hours to the opinions of men of mediocrity, and out of all he hears makes up those webs in which other politicians get involved like giddy flies. To this power of judgment Talleyrand adds that without which neither statesmen nor generals can ever succeed-namely, exceedingly good luck.' "Wednesday, 30th,-I received a letter from Charles revie. He says :-' I cannot say how sorry I am for Talleycand's death. B.e was one of the last of thatgreat school of politeness and social eminence which is now nearly it not quite extinct; and, e'hatever he may have been in youth and middle age, Isis declining years have ebbed away with tranquillity. and in the constant exercise of very many admirable qualities, as well as of a conservative wisdom and moderation, becoming to hinself and beneficial to the world. He will be a loss to the King of the French, for his counsels were always prized by bin,, and he combined in himnself a sort of link between the old and new men.' " From Talleyrand to the King of the French the transition is natural, and Mr. Raikes makes his comments on the latter without predilection or re- serv,e. I-e was no friend to the throne of July, but, if he had been such, as an unbiassed spectator of its selfish objects, its unscrupulous and petty intrigues, and its cheap expedients, he could scarcely in the end have judged it differently. We know of no character in modern history which has descended in public estimation so steadily and irretrievably as that of Louis Philippe, and this from no vulgar deference to the success of the adversaries who so easily crushed him with all hig web work, but on the permanenit and unimpeachableAground of the paltry narrowness of view and the inyaan instincts which unfitted him for the part he was called upon to play. As respects the forwnar, a spurious Ulysses; and, as respects the latter, the most considerable ".iper a so0n insie" that the world has beheld, he appears, from the stovies which reached Mr. Raikes, to have justified all that has been said of him by his most contemptuous &-semies. D-.ughter of his niece, the Duchesse de Dino, now Conn. teee H1. de Caistellane. f Prince TaUoytand's bed was mnade with a deep slope in the middle, rising equally at the head and at the feet, his nearest app-oach to lying down. It was his habit to eat nothing ruitil dinner time. Att ehis, bis only meal during foar and tweaty l49urs, his appetite wvas enormcous g Bis ingaratitude is zhesvn in many instances, as also his double dealing; and, again, that fatal propensity to nepotism whidm induced him to scheme for the peconiary interests of his family in the midst of the political dangers which hourly threatened him. Mr. Raikes relates his detection in a flagrant attempt at imposition whereby the estate of Ramboniillet, ieally worth 1,100,030 francs a-year, was estimated as an appanage for the Duc de Nemours of only 500,(00 francs. Also, he relates in refereace to simi, lar transactions a conversation he had with M. Beugnot- " Feb. 20.-At Madame de Girardin's, this evening, I had some oonversation with hL Beugnot, a very inteUigent and agreeable man. He describes to me the despicable state of the Chamber of Deputies under the present system, guided solely by petty private interests, and open to bribery in every shape. 'The King,' said he, 'if he was not so chary of his money, might hAve a large majority on any question if he pleased. The fact is, that those from the Provinces are in such needy circumstances that they can hardlg afford the expense of a iouarey to Paris, or their stay during the meeting; such men are always on the watch to sell their votes. A sutn of 500f. will very often decide them to support any nweasare;and 'when the case is urgent the Government, 'with money, can always carry their point. You talk,' said he, 'of the profligate times of Sir Robert Walpole in England ; but here the venality is more contemptible, because the times are snore enlightened, the bribes are more insignificant, and the corruption mors general. Casimir Perier, who squandered tne pubhc money in this way, when a deputy named his price, never offesed him more than one-half, and generally succeeded in his object. The primary object of Louis-Philippe is to gain money, and his accession to the thronae was a mere commercial speculation. In other monarchies, the privato property of the sovereign is blended wvith his Royal appanage to support the splendour and dignity of his Crownv; but Louis-Philippe was determined from the beginning to gain all he could, and give nothing in return. He v,as elected King of the French on the 7th of August; on the previous day (the 6th), he made over by a deed, drawn up by Dnpin the lawyer, all his private property as Dake of Orleans, being five millions per annum, to is children, reserving the usufruct to himself ; he enjoys the income of the Duo d'Aumale, gained from the Prince de Conde, tiUl his majority, and his civil list is from 12 to 14 millions per annum. With these colossal rneans the whole study of his life Is to throw by every manueuvre bis own incidental expenses on the sboulders of the nation. It is then only that he is really magnificent." Further references to his jobs follow in vol. iv., page 226. Then we come to his duplicity in the affair of the Spanish marriages, and a whole series of such passages as the follow ing:- " July 1.-The other night at Nenuiy, when there was a large assembly and several diplomatists, Louis Philippe began in his usual way to declare most vehemently that from the commencemeat he had never interfered either directly or indirectly in Spanuis affAirs, that he had aU along maintained the strictest neutrality, and would still continue the same course. He then addressed the English Ambassador, saying, ' And I earnestly request of you, Lord Cowley, to repeat this my assurance to your own Court in your nest despatch.' I believe the other was almost tempted to say, 'Indeed, Sire, I shall gwrite just the reverse.'"' Mr. Raikes, having from time to time communicated to the Duke of Wellington his impressions of the tricky monarch, had at length the satisfaction of ascertaining that the duke's favourable opinion of him was shaken. " I said to him ' I hope then, Sir, that you do not think my opinions about him have been exaggerated?' 'No,' he replied, ' not in the least.' Her Majes,ty herself, on the testimony of the Duke of Beaufort, was very much incensed against Louis Philippe when, after the bouirgeois cajolery employed at NVindsor and Eu, at length he threw off the mask. She says that he has not only been guilty of a low dishonest political intrigue, but has forfeited his word of honour as a gentleman t.' her personally, while pretending the most sincer3 friendship. She will not allow his picture to be pua up in the Castle and would not be disinclined to g e to war with him." Perhaps the very best story against him is that related to M:r. Raikes by th3 Dutch Minister. "Aug. 8.-I called on Fagel this morning. and we had along conversation on the state of affairs here, conCerning which his convictions agree exactly with aLl that I have written. His opinion also is that Louis Philippe is the greatest four-e that ever existed. Fagel has been Dutch Minister here ever since the peace, and hag watched his career in public and private lire. He mentioned several anecdotes of him; one exemplilies him completely.. It was shortly after the days of July, *rben he bad accomplished his wisbes and had become King. One of his secretaries was loitering in a salon of the Palais RoyaL when he suddenly observed the King advancing through the suite of rooms with Dapont de 1'Eure, engaged in very serious conversation; wishing to get out of the way, and seeing no means of escape, he posted himself secretly behind the door, which was open, in hopes that the two might pass on without observing him. It so happened that they stopped in the room where he was coacealed, so that witbout meaning It he saw and heard aU that passed. Louis Philippe had his hand on the other's shoulder, and in the most earnest manner was expressing his determination to act in the way most consonant with the ideas of the Liberal party; he was lavish of his cordiality and gratitude to Dupont himself, and when they parted shook his hand in the most friendly manner. No sooner had the other turned his back to go out, and before he had quitted the room, than Louis Philippe began to hold up his finger at him with a face of mockery, and made a movemernt with his foot, as if he could hardly prevent himself from kicking him; a feeling which he aicerwards reduced to practice with Lafitte, Lafayette, and all those Liberals who contributed to his advancement." What a picture is here of the jubilant Ulysses "taking a sight " at the supposed dupe who was actually destined to supplant him. Christmas Pantomime by Majesty in person, and vulgar farce amid the realities, if we may so term them, of Courtly intercourse ! The Royal clown in the act of stowing away his sausages, unconscious of the observant policeman at his elbow, is caught by the ear and dragged forwardi to the footlights. There we leave him in the face of an audience of the nineteenth century. (To be continaed.)

BOAD REFOR.M IX E4SZ LOTHrAA. The question of turnpike abolition and maintenance of roads by assessment, welh has been for 10 years in afitation in Haddingtonshire, as well as in the counties of Fife, Forfar, Lanark, and others, was brought to a crisis in the first-named county at a meeting of the general turnpike trustees, held at Haddington on Thursday last. A keen and animated debate took place, in which the proposed reform was advocated by Lord Elcho, A P. for the county, and resisted by the Right Hon. R. A. Christopber Nisbet Hamilton, Mh.P. for South Lincolnshire. The result was that the numbers were equal for and against reform, when the chairman (the Marquis of Tweeddale) gave his casting vote against the proposed change. The question came before the meeting on the report of Mr. M'Connel, the emrinert road surveyor, who had giren In an elaborate report on the roads of the county. Some of the roads had fWen Into disrepair owing to the falling off of the toll dues, resulting partly from the absor - tion of the through traffic by the new highwav,-the ragway-and by the diverting of traffic into the side roads t- wards the rallway stations, on which it was not intercepted by tolls. The couaty had on varios ocCssions sanctioned resolutions and even draught bills for the abolition of toUs, and the imposition of assessment on lands and heritages and on horses, in lieu thereof, and the farmers' clubs had almost unanimously supported the proposed reforma. Before finally deciding, the county had employed Mir. 'Connel to report on the whole subject, and, ater employing nearly two years in the collectio, of sSatistics, that gentleman reported in favour of the present, system, with a readjustn.ent of the toU bars, so as to intercept the altered currents of traffic. Lord ELcuo, in moving "that, In the oplnion of this meeting, the system of maaintaining roads by teols and statute labour should be abandoned," contended that the toll system was inconvenient and expeusive, and quoted the letter of an hon. baronet, last year an opponent and now an advocate of the present system, depicting its great inconvenience in calling on the wayfarer to unbutton and deliver his twopence, and its expensiveness from the fact that it sometimes cost one penny to coUect the other. He quoted the testimony of reports previotisly adopted by the county that it was partialand unequal, making one man pay toll for a single mile and enabling others to travel 10 or 11 for a single toll. Se addnoed the report of Mr. 'Connel to show that on even his economical system of farming the tolls the expense of collection was 13 per cent. for merely local collection, or, as his Lordship held, from 20 to 25 per cent. when the expense of general management, the usual allow. ance for loss in colection, and the expenses of toil. houses, &c., steel yards were included, An assessment, on the other hand, could be levied for 5 per cent. The equitability of an assessment, he held, admitted of no dispute. I know, said his Lordship, that my right hon. friend holds the doctrine that those who use the roads should pay for them. That Is a doctrine that he holds in common with that great authority, Adam Smith, and perhaps he will allow me to compliment him on being a disciple of Adam Smith. (A laugh.) Mr. NISBET HAAMILTON.-I always was. Lord ELCHO.-Perhaps -with respect to roads, but not in other articles; but I am very glad he is a con-vert to him in any point. But with regard to Adam Smith, I thought It [right to look up what he says on the [subject. No doubt Adam Smith says that those who use the roads should pay for them, and nothing could be fairer; but you cannot make people pay in proportion to the damage done by them, for the man who travels one mile pays the same as he who travels five, and unquestionably the latter does more damage to the roads. But what does Adam Smith also say ?-" This tax or toll, though it is advanced by the carrier, is finally paid by the consumer, to whom it must always be charged in the price of the goods." And In another place he says: - "The expense of maintaining good roads and communications is no doubt beneficial to the whole society, and may therefore, without any injustice, bh defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society." Mr. N. HAatILTON.-The nation. Lord ELCRO.-I know my right hon. friend means by that ironical expression to imply that it would be a general assessment like the income-tax. But my objection to tbe roads being maintained by national funds is that the roads would be in the condition in which the roads are abroad, where they are maintained by the State, and where the through lines are in a good state, but al the local roads are up to the knees in mud. I apprehend that the road assessment would be put on the same footing as any other county assessment, whether for police, prison, or other purposes. At last meeting Ireferre to whathad takenplaceSnIreland, and Iquoted from thereport of the commissioner appoluted to make the inquiry. I find that Mr. Clements, who was the commissioner, says, with reference to this argrTment, that those who use the roads should pay for them :-" The specious fallacy of ' those who use a road ought to pay for It' has never stood the test of inquiry, the correlative proposition that those who do not use a road ought not to pay or it being contrary to present practice, and to our fixed notions of maintaining highways for the common benefit." Mr. Clements's report was drawn up in 1856, and in accordancewith it an Act of Parliament waspassed whichabolished al tolls in Ireland, and substituted au assessment. I say that an assessment is the fairest way of raising the revenue required for the maintenance of roads, that every person is interested in having good roads, and that it is good roads that make property valuable. The authority Ihave already quoted, Adaam Smith, says :-" As vicinity to a town is a cause of rent, so vicinity to a road, navigable river, or canal, by diminishing the expense of carriage to some great market, may have the same effect." Therefore every person's property is dependent on having good roads. fWithout them you cannot get your corn to market; and thou-h a proprietor may never put his foot on the road, stiEl it is reasonable he should be caUed on to pay for roads which raise his rent, and which indeed give him rent Lord Elcho proceeded to say that the roposed assessment was but an extension of the old statute fabour principle, by which all but the principal lines of thoroughfare were still maintained. The turnpike system was first introduced into tbis county in 1750, to meet the case of the through traffic then opening up throughout the country, but now that the rnilways had absorbed the through traffic the reason for maintaining roads by tolls entirely ceased. His Lordship then cited the following eight Acts, in which the Legislature had sanctioned the principleof assessment for maintaining roads - -1. Highland Roads and Bridges Act, 5Wth of George lIt. 2. Peeblesshire Act, 1818, for Improvement of Roads and Extinction of Debt; assessment, Gd. sterling in pounds Scots. 3. Argyllshire Act; assessment not exceeding 8d. per pound on rental and 4s. on horses, where the person is not otherwise assessed. 4. Orkney; assessment, Is. for roads and ls for debts. 5. Perthshire; a road aloDg Loch Earn, made by Sir Peter Murray. (i. Welsh Consohdation Act, after the Rebecca riots. 7. Isle of Man Act; assess ment on wheels and dogs. S. Act for Ireland, on Mr. Clement's report. Lord Eleho concluded by adverting to stalistics collected in the counties of Fife and Lanark, showisg that the burden on property would be less, as well as -more equitably arranged, under a system of assessment instea-d of tolls. Mr. AiTcnisox seconded the motion of Lord Elcho. The Right Hon. NISBET HAMIsLTON moved *- "T'hat this meeting is of oplulin that the nicat equitable mode of laishig fun is for the maintenance of the public roads 1s by a well-reguated system of tolls." He said,-Unless my noble friend can prove beyond the possibility of contradiction thab it;is impossible to maintain the highways of this county by means of turnpikes aud statute labour assessment, which I maintain he has failed to do, I cannot conceive his introducing, especially in a district like this, the dangerous principle whiclh he proposes-a principle which is mnost obnoxious in the general taxation * f the country, and which, if introduced into local matters, whether In the form of an addition to our income-tax or our assessed taxes, would te stil more odious than the form in which these taxes already (xist. The income-tax is, I hold, a system of imposition that ought only to be applied-and I believe statesmen will generally acknowledge It to be so-to the raising of pnblic evenae in cases of great emergency, and ought not to he employed if any other equitable means can be brought forward for the purpose. I carnot possibly conceive that in a county like this,which is called the garden of Scotland-and very justly, beeause it is so highly farmed,-and where thcre is a considerable amount of intercourse from place to place, it is impossible to uphold that ancient and, as I maintain, that equitablessystem of levying tho revenue from tolls, by which the money is drawn fronm the pockets of those who use the roads. When I find Mr. C'onnel laying down this broad principle that I have mentioned in his report, it certainly appears to me to be a practicable as well as equitable thing to raise the revenue by a system of tolls fairly arranged. It is clear to me that by consolidating the different road trusts of the county under one general board, by converting many of the statute labour lines into turnpike roads, and by placing toll-bars at the points best calculated to intercept traffic, the required revenue would be obtained. My noble friend has referred to different places that have resorted to the assessment principle, such as Argyleshire and Orkney. But let usconsider what tbe highways of those countiesarem Their chiefcommanication Js bystearaboatsandother vessels, and in Argyleshireat least the roads were made at the public expense, and not by local arrangement. And as to the county of Orkney, you might as well talk about putting turnpikes on the Bass Rock, My noble friend says there is a considerable amount of expense in collecting this tax. Not the least doubt about it. There is also immense expense in the collection of many of our national taxes; but that is no reason why the county should abandon that which is a just mode, and substitute one which is oppressive, inquisitorial, and unfair. Are we to adopt a system of confiscation because it is simple and easy ? I maintain toat no greater blow ould be inilictedon the landed interest in this country than that system, which had its commencement in Manchester, and is now taken up by a set of conceited shopkeepers in London, of invariably lay. iDg the burden, if they can, on the land of the country. After adverting to the diffulty of obtaining legislative sanction to such a measure, especially in the face of a strong opposition in the county, Mr. Nisbet Hamilton said he would rather have the three tolls in his parish (Dirleton) doubled than sanction this unjust arrangement, which would not even exempt property, as the inconme-tax did, when burdened by family settlements or otherwise, but would assess on the full rental free and burdened estates alike. My noble friend, he continued, has referred to Fife and Lanark as having adepted his view of the case. Now, I can quite well understand a parcel of Glasgow manufacturers and shopkeepers overwhelming the landed Interests in Lanarkshire and compelling them to make roads for their use. We know very well that the assessment on mills, factories, and houses never amounts to anything like the assessment on land. A man might make 50,OOOf. by his mill and yet net have a tithe of lhe land which a proprietor has who only receives o,000l. a-year; and all this shows how cautious we ought to be before we adopt a principle of this sort ; for de- pend upon it when you once adopt it there will be no retracing your steps. (Hear, hear. When you come to establish your rural police, and build gaoLs and lunatic asylums, you will be favoured with a little more of this principle. Butthis agi.tation is not a new one. Au agitation of a similar nature exists eLsewhere with regard to the assessmeDt for the poor. It is held a convenient system to assess the land by gentlemen living in towns and places of that description-it isheldvery much by the manufacturing interest through which pauperism naturally exists to a. considerable extent in these particular places, io conseqiuence of gentlemen who have mills employing a good deal of labour, and when- ever that labour becomes incompetent to carry on its work like a machine, the labourer is set about his business, and the consequence is that the poor-rate in towns becomes enormously increased. An attempt was made of that kind by means of the Government of the coantry, but was re. sisted by Parliament, to obtamn what yot will probably have here if my noble friend's motion is carried, namely, a national rate for the relief of the poor. Now, I think it is the duty of the landed interest to resist all this. Dopend upon it, yon wvllhave burdens enough without fishirg for them. l With this mutiny in India you will liave plenty | income tax cares for the next few years withoat fishing for the most inconvenient mode of repairing yoar roads- and I recommend you to be very cautious before you take - this leap in the dark. A national poor-rate would hsg the most unjust thing in the world, and would tax the country for the relief of the towns. We have another agitation is London among a set of conceited shopkeepers, agitating for a system of "road reform and turrnpike abolition." Tlihe English of the system is that the land is to bear the burden, and that these gentlemen are to be entitled to roll along the roads in their carriages aud four without pying a farthing for the roads they use, My noble friend alluded to Ireland, We all know that formerly there was seldom anything done with regard to roads in Ireland without a job. It was done by presentmnents, by grand juries, and the maost atrocious jobs used to take pl ce, and the people were made to contribute to the maintenauce of roads to gentlemen's houses, or roads leading to nowhere, and probably the change that has taken place is just the consequence of that great abuse. But no Fuch evil euiste here- and I agree to the principle of equity and to the mode pointed ou-t by common sense that those who use the roads should pay for them. Mr. Sisbet Hamilton then referred to Mr. M'Connel's report to show that the valued rental of land In the county was 290,0001., while the rental of mineral property did not exceed 7,2001E He maintained that it was the mineral, and not the agricaltural Droperty that out up the roads, yet this was the proportion they would severaUy pay under an assessment. The mineral interest will have nothing to pay, whereas the good simple landed interest will present their throats to be out by these butchers, (Laughter.) With reference to the theory that it was the consumer who paid he asked whether the manufacturer would acoept that theory if they were to propose to put a tax of Id. per yard on cotton. It was only whenuthey came to deKl with burdens on land that they were told about the tax falling on the consumer. HIe thought it was the wiser policy to adhere to the present system, modified so far as was necessary, in consequence of railway communication, and placing the bars so as to intercept the trafii3, and charge it in the most equitable manner. Sir GEORGE sURs, SUTM seconded the amendment. The Earl of HADDrnGTox thought it would be for the advantage of the county if they could establish an equitable and moderate assessment. It would be much more convenient, and likely to cause a much better feeling than the present system; forthat reason he wouldvote for Lord E leho's motion,on the understandingthat he should be after. wards at liberty to move the reservation of statute lsbour from it. Among the other speAkers were the Marquis of Tweed- I dale and hIr. Brown, ho opposed the motion chiefly on the ground that the proposed change was a local and not a general mesune, and would unjustly affect certain dis. tricts, especiaUy those parishes in which frontier tolts must stiU be maintained. The Marquis also entered into figures to show that in his view the saving in the collection was too small to induce them to go into the change. The vote was then taken, when 18 voted for the motion and 18 for the amendment, the Marquis of Tweeddale giving his casting vote for the amendment, which was therefore carried. On the motion of Mr. NISBET HAMIILTON a select committee was appointed to confer with Mr. 'Connel with regard to the most practicable means of consolidating the several turnpike trusts within the county into one, and the readjustment of the tols, so as to secure the largest amount of revenue with the least inconvenience to the public. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
