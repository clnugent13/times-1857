RAILWAY AND MINING SBREABS. Thursday EvenlDg. The absence of business, coupled with the apprehension that the present state of trade will seriously affect the traffic returns, has caused further depression in the railway market. Great Western advanced 4 per cent. solely from a scarcity of the stock for transfer. South-Western were also higher. Great-Western preference shares were heavy the 5 per Cents. being quoted as low as 92 to 9. (polo nial deacriptions, especially Indian, were in better demand, and showed atendencytoi.mprove. French continue flat from the falling off in the traffic, and a redwction occurred in the Dutch Rhenish. In American securities Illinois Central shares receded, and a further advance took place in Canada Government Bonds. In mines Wheal Edward improved 5s. from purchases. An average business was transacted in joint-stock banks generally at former prices. In miiscellaneous securities Peninsular and Oriental left off nominally higher. OnDINAEY BEARnS 'A1R BT(1

RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE. LONDON AND SOUTH-WESTERN- A special general meeting of this companywas held yesterday at the Waterloo.bridge sttion, Lambeth, for the purpoee of considering the report of the directors respecting the making of a brach railway of about five miles from Exer to the port of Topsham, and ex plantorv of certai other objects zor whilch it Is proposed to eek additional powers from Parliament; Mr. W.J Chapln in the chair. Mr. L. Crombie, the Se~cretary, read h eot nasrc Of which ha appeared in aVC Time.8 The CHArRMiN sad they would perceive that the report embrhe nine requirements. MAot of them were eo smalU that it would not be worth while to trouble them on the subject, but there were two or three matters that required the unction of Parlianent. They were all aware thbat agreements with their approval had been entered into with te Wimbledon avd Epsom Railway Company during the lasb session of Parliament, but the standing orders would not admit at that time of the introduction of oertaln clauses In the Bill to sanction the arrangementsbetween the two companies; it w&s therefore necessary to applr for those powers in the present seesion. The next matter for which theyrequired the sanction of Parliament related to the Saliabury and Yeovl Railwawy, the works on whioh were proceeding vigomusly. They wanted power to enable theoi to cary out the agreement for th6 lease, which would' remove oertain diffioulties; he therefore asked for permision to prooeed with that applicatio. The works on the Yeovil and Exeter line were also prooseding vigorously; and as it was neoessary to make some improvements in the line and levels which would effect some economy in construction, but could not be done without additional power, he had also to ask their assent to that proposition. I t was desirable to purchase land at various places on their liie for additions and improvements to everal stations. With regard to the proDosed branch to Topshaum they felt it their duty to promote it, although there wLas a desire to withdraw from all further extensions (ear, hear.) The Yeovil and Exeter line would pas thin 4 miles of Topsham, and it was the only port to which they oould obtain acoes between Exeter and Salis. bury, and would be of condderable advantage to plaes near their line for the shipment of wood, corn, and other produce, and for the import of coal and other materids requinred at Honiton and other places en the, ralwy. The Exmuouth people had obtAined powers to make a line from Exmouth to Exeter on the broad gaue, to join She 8oath Devon or Bristol and Exeter &2%wy at Exeter, but sosoon asthey found that the South. Woetern Company Weroe maling a line to Exeter they re solved npon making the portion of their line only between Esmouth and Topsanam on the nartow gauge, provided the South-Western Companywould undertaketo make a branch from their Yeovil and Exeter line to meet the Exmouth lne at Topghain The branch to Topsham would be 4R miles in length from a point 1I miles from Exeter. Their eation in Exeter was well chosen and It was expected that the taffic would be considerable over the branch to the watering place at Exmouth They thought it would have the effect ef reducing the expense of their terminus At Exeter, and that they ouldsnotdo better thanlmakethearrangement,subJect t the approval of theproprietors. Theyweretoworkthe line when completed at 0 per cent, of the receipts. He flattered himself they would excuse the board for entering into thbt arrangement. Another matter was for power to make a small for' at Southampton to facilitate the traflic from the man line to the Dorchester line without coming into the station at Southampton. He then explained that small quantities of land at various stations for additional aceommodafton were required, and concluded by moving a formal resolution for the adoption of the report and of the recommendations therein. Mr. HXRAPATH hoped that the proposed branch to Tops. hon would not lead to a Parliamentary contest with the Great Western, or the broad gauge lines, as the Exmouth and Exeter line was authoried to join them on the broad gauge at Exeter. He quite approved the proposed branch, as forming the easest and best communication from Eseter to Exmouth, provided its contruection would not involve any contest with other companies. (Hear.) The CHArM}f said the object of adopting that line was economy. The inhabltants of Exmouth miuited the SouthWestern Company to join their line t Topsham, stting that they vere prepared to promote a Bill In Parliament for the abandonment of the Dortion of their authorized line between Topsham and Exeter, provided the South-Western Company would make the branch to Topseham. kr. RERAPATH was actuated by a feelng of peace, with a view to preserve harmony between neighbou ring companies; but so far as the line itself was conoerned,he thought a better one could not be selected. Mr. EHws believed that no company had a moral right to romote extensions beyond their original undertaking wale the shares of the company were nnder par because shareholders who were opposed to extensions could not quit the company withott loss He sincerely hoped they would not promote the Topshasa line if it would involve a Parliamentary contest The map in the room was not drawn either with candour or accurcy. He believed the Exeter and Exmouth broad gauge line was intended to enter Exeter on the western side of the river Exe. He thought their project was premature, and that they should wait until Par- .ment hadecde the question before seeking powers to -oke that branch. Parliament had already decided that it'sbould be constructed on the broad gauge, and it was not certain whether they would reverse that decision, as it was Impossible to say what oourse Parliamentary committees wtonld adpt. The CH-UERN said the Exmouth line on the broad gauge was not going forward, nor had they capital available to carry it out. The E xmouth people had stated to them that they had funds sufficient to complete the line from Exmouth to Topsham. provided the South-Western would promise them to make tne branch to Topebam, and the directors had done so subject to the approval of the shareholder. Of coure, if the Exinouth Company failed in their endeavours to obtain the rnquisite powers, the arragement could not be carried out. lr. TITE, Y.P., was not by any means disposed to have a broad gauge fight. The Exmouth and Exeter line was originally granted to the South-Western Company as a narrow gauge line, but it subsequently fell through, and afterwards Parliament granted powers to the Exeter people to construct a line on the breed gauge. They were now, it appeared, prepared to go to Parliament to limit the line from Exmouth to Topsham, provided the South-Western jotned them at the latter place. The population of Exmouth was 4,300 and of Topsham 3,700; he believed the trafficwas worth extending their line to those plaes, but if there were to be gauge contests he would advbe them to pause before they asked for Powers to make it. With regard to the Wimbledon and Epsom arrangement, he hoped it would not involve them in hostilities with the Brighton Company; it so, he wouldsay wait. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Serjeant GAsELEE said he unfortunately differed with his colleagues on the subject of extension. e dld not recommend the line to Topsham. He agreed with Mr. Helps on the subject of Parliamentary contests, and from the absurd system of dealing with Railway Bills he would never oppose any Bill In Parliament, for whether they won or wthetzer they lost, they were sure to have a frightful bill of costs to pay. If the people of Exmouth or Topsham wanted a railway let them make it. His constituents had sent him to the board to advocate 3 non-extension policy, and he would adhere to it. Mr. BIRCHA-M, in reply to questions, stated that if Parhamenut declined to sanction the Exeter and Exmouth Bill the Topeham extemnson line could be withdrawn. In reply to questions it was stated that the traffic of the proposed le was estimated at 1,4001. per mile per annum that the broad gauge companies had not sabscribed an thing towards the Exmouth line, and had refused to Su6scribe towards the construction of an expensive bridge over the Exe to enable the Exnouth people to form a junction with the broad gauge lines. It was believed they were quite indifferent to the matter. Mr. FooKs, seconded by Mr. CAMPLIN, moved an amendment, to the effect that the report be received and its recommendations adopted, except so much of it as related to the making of a branch railway to Topebaan. On the amendment being put there appeared 18 in favour of it and 20 against it ; on the motion for the adoption of the report and its recommendations being nut there appeared 20 in favour of it and 18 against it. The motion was declared camried. On the motion of Dr. SNow a vote of thanks was passed to the chairman, and the proceedings terminated. CRYSTAL PALACE COMPANY. The directors of this company have just issued their report It states that on the 17th inst. four new dIrecors will be proposed to be added to the board. The directors believe that the whole of the ascounts for the year when made up to the 30th of April, 1-o5, will show a surplus of from 10,0001. to 12,00uL. to the credit of the revenue accounts, after deducting interest ai all borrowed money and debenture etock, aud a year's dividend on the 7 per cent, preference shares. This result has been arrived at from #Lu Actual balance of the company's books for the first six months (namely, to the 3lst of October last); and for the remaining six months, from an estimate based on the assumption that the receipts will equal those during the corresponding period of last year, and that the ordinary expenditure during this period will he kept on the scale to which it has bcen reduced-a scale which the directors believe is about as low as can be established consistently with the preservation and protection of the compDany's pro- perty The g receipts for the six months ending October au ount to98,5.57b Only about 31,000?. of the 6 per cent. debenture stock has been taken up, in respect of wthich 18,0881. has been already received In cash. ln regard to the applcation of this money the directors beg to state that it has been made strictly in accordance with the provision of the Act of Parliament, and that a similar amount of debenture debt has been extinguishcd. The directors are quite aware that the position of the moneymarket, as wel as other circumstances, has been unfavourable to the taking up of this stock, but they feel It to be their duty to state plainly to the shareholders that it is now absolutely essential, in order to meet debentures immediately falling due, nd other Liabilities on temporary loans secured by debentures, that a very considerable additional amount of the stock should be forthwith taken up. They feel that it is only from the shaireholfers and their friends that thi3 ssistance to the concern c be expected, sinoe the rate of interest, six per oent. (and which is the maximnm allowed by the Act of Parliament), does not, at the present moment, offer. sufficient inducement to the publio to subscribe for it Further, it should be distinctly understood that the directors have no power, even if they had theinclination, to sanction the issuing of the stock under its par value. Thils stock, by annihilating the existing debenture debt, and the balanco of the original purchase-money for the land. will form A first charge on all the property of the company, before even the seven per cent. preference shares, and it therefore would appear to be amply secured, and to present such an investment as 4o shareholder need hesitate to make. The capif* account of the compauy has been practically closed fir some time past, and there has been no addition rcade tobe amount of debt showrn by the balance-sheet ubmt'tothe meeting in June last, and which will be absorb4'lrhen the debenture stock shall have been fully ta thas been already shown that the annual re- ample cover for the interest on the deben. turf it , and the property of the ompany over which it wvll form the first charge is upwards of 200 acres of freohold lnd, with the plzat and wrorkc upon it, in addition to the buildings of the Place, with the grepter portion of their valuable contents, an amount ot property in the g ggregate which It seems only resion ble to asume could not, inder =y clrcumustanoes, realize less than half a million of money. With regarrd to the reduction of capital, the dfreoXors propoeo, In conformity with the powrer conterred on them brteb tParliaiaent, tht in respect of evry orditr and preference shae which shall be speed to be extinguihed a ticket shall be isned to the propietor of uch share, entitling him to a certn number of gratuitOs admions to the Palae and grounds on aU orinar shillg days The ticket to be issued in exchange for she share to be called a shareholder's ticket, to hAve the name of the proprietor impresed upon it, and to be prep&red in snch a rorm as will oonvenitutly admit of the number of admisions in respeot of which it ig used beng from time to time recorded upon it; for which purpose the ticket must be kept entire, and atter the full number of admissio for which it is insed hAve been made une of it Wil expire, and be returned to -th oompanv The ticket to be available without the neoesity of the proprietor's peruosl presenee.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, THURSDAY, DEC. 10. The LoRD CyA?iCELLOR took hi seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock. Lord SHArESBURY preented a petition from the Indai Cbritian Assocition o Edishurgh, praying that in any meares for the future government of India stepe be takea for the complete removal of all Government encouragement to caste, all public su,cport of idolatry, and all ob6tructions to the profession of Christianity by the natives, or to the free promulgation of the tmths of the GospeL TRANSFER OF REAL ESTATE. Lord ST. LEONARD'S laid on the table a BiU for smplfying the Transfer of Real Estates, which was read a ilyst time. BANK ISSUES INDEX[NITY BILL, Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY said he believed there had been a generAl understanding thatt the discussioa upon this Bill should take place upon the third reading, and therefore he now proposed that the Bill be read a second time and any debate pon It should take plce to-morro w (this day). Earl DERBY was not present upon the occasion when the presumed understanding was come to, but he had to desire to interfere with it. It was very inaportant that the Bill should not be aUcwed to pass withoat being discussed (hear), but at the same time he had no wish at all to impede a measure which he believed was but an act of justice to the Government. He, however -would avail him- elf of the present opportunity of calling tGe attention of the Government to a part of the Bill of which, as he conceived, some explanation was neces6ary; he referred to that part I ef the Bill which required that the rate of discount should be kept up during the whole period of the suspeneion of the Act of 1844 to a minimum of 1l per cent. He could understand that at the p riod when the suspension took place it might have been quite proper and necessary to do so, but it was different wben they were passing an Act not merely of indemnity but for continuing the Busension of the Act of 1844 for 28 days alter the meeting orParliament in Februnary. The continuance of so high a rate of interest after the absolute necessity for it had psased awav was most un;desirable, as tending to prevent the restoraton of public confidence and to inf'ict great and perhaps undeserved suffering upon the smaller clas8 of traders. Howas vaot prepared to move any amendment upon the point, but he thought the Government would act wisely in leaving a discretionary power to the, Dank ol England, instead of prescribing an absolute restriction for two months longer. If the Government should press the p rovision to which he had referred, he hoped at least they would be prepared to give some explanations of the reasOns which induced them to take that course. The Bill was then read a second time. TRANSPORT OF TROOPS TO INDIA. Viscount DUNGANNON, in moving for coples of any correspondence that might have taken place during the present year between the East India Directors and the Boatd of Control relative to the transmission of troops to India observed that he did net seek to inquire into the question whether the Government had commenced sufficiently early to send out reinforcements to India, but he wanted to know ,why, when the necessity for reinforcements was admitted by them, they had not adopted means to forward the troops with the utmost expedition. It appeared that a passage through France had been offered by the Emperor Napoleon, but it had not been accepted, neither had a similar offer on the part of the Sultan. Troops were sent in clipper ships which by some peculiar mode of reasoning were conceived by the Government to be a quicker mode of transit than steamers. There was an impression among the public that the best means had not been adopted to forward reinforcements, and it was desirable that the paper he asked for should be produced in order to verify or disprove that belief. The noble lord concluded by maoving according to the terms of his notice. Earl GRANVILLE said the noble lord was perhaps not aware that a committee of the other House either had been or would immediately be appointed to investigate the whole subject, wbo might require the documents moved for by the noble lord to be produced before them, and it was unusual In such cases to anticipate the possible action of a committee. Lord DUNGANNON would not press his motion, upon the understanding that the papers should be laid before the committee. Earl GRANVILLE wished to be understood as saying that the committee would have power to call for the papers If it chose, but he could not pledge himself that they would be required. The motion was then withdrawn. THE'HOME AND LOCAL GOVERNMIETS OF INDIA. lord MELVILLE-Thero Is one point which has not, I think, been alluded to as It should have been, upon which I should wish to have some information. It seems extraordinary that the local Government should have had no Information of an organized mutiny like that in India, while from Calcutta to reshawur it was well known the Bengal regiments meant to mutiny upon a certain day. Fortunately for us, however, it broke out at Meerut before the day, or our difficulties would have been greatly Increased. I am told that information was given to the local Goverm ment by indigo planters and even by officers, that this information was disregarded, and that many letters which veresentwere not even answered or noticed. How the local Government, possessing this information, should have gone on wilthout making the slightest prepcaratlon to meet the mutiny I cannot Imagine. I beleve the Government at home had little or no information, and therefore I wish to ask wvhat information they had received upon this subject from the local Government. Earl GRANVILLE was understood to say that Her Majesty's Government were not aware of the exact nature of the information which the local Government of India had received, and that he was, therefore, unable to give a definite answer to the question of the noble earL The Earl of DERBY said the question which his noble friend had introduced to their notice was one which ought not to be dealt with lightly; but, although be was o opinion that any discusion with respect to It would be a the present moment premature, he thought it was the bounden duty of Parliament to inquire into it when the proper time arrived. (Hear, hear.) THE ASSASSINATION OF MR. SULLIVAN. Earl POWlS then rose to ask what information Her Majesty's Government had received In reference to the assassination of Mr. Sullivan, Her Majesty's Minister at Peru, and what steps they had taken in the matter. The noble earl in doing so observed that the case of Mr. Sullivan was one of very great interest, not only to the family of that gentleman, but to the country at lrge. The Earl of CLA.RENDON.-It was only in the month of August last, my lords that we received from aer Majesty's consul at Lima an account of the maurderous attack which had been made on Mr. Sullivan. Hle was, it appears, fired at by an assassin while dining in company with his secretary and another person. The assassin, however, escaped, and I may observe that Mr. Sulivan, Immediately beforo his death, was heard to say tbat he did not believe he had an enemy in the world. Indeed, his general opinion was that he had not, for there never lived a more amiable or good-natured man. The assassin bad accomplices waiting for him, who escaped with him outside the city. It is, however, due to the Peruvian Government to state that nothing could equal the activity of the measures which they took to have the whole transaction cleared up. They expressed the utmost regret at its occurrence, and I may add that the Peruvian. dinister for Foreign Affairs attended at the funeral of Mr. Sullivan, together with the consul, as chief mourner. In thfe month of September the same Minbiter communicated to Her Majesty's Government, through the Peruvian consul here, that he bad reason to believe tbat thu man by whom the murder had been committed was a foreigner; that they knew where this foreigner was concealed, and that a police force had been sent to apprehend him. Whether that force succeeded in the attempt or not we have been as yet unable to ascertain, but we have been made aware that another man, who has been recognized by the servant of Mr. Snllivan as having been one of the accomplices of the assassin, has been taken prisoner. The Peruvian Government offered, In the first instance, a reward of 3,000 dollars for the apprehension of the guilty party; this sum they afterwards raised to 10,000 dollars, and we ourselves have offered a rewvard of 300t. I have only tol say, in conclusion, that the Peruvian Government entertain every hope of being ablo to arrest the assassin, and that no fault can at all events be found with thc aourse which they have adopted in the matter, BANKS OF IRELAND AND SCOTLAND, Lord MONTEAGLE, in risingto move for accounts showing the circulation of the banks of Ireland and Scotland, said that the object which he had in doing so was to obtain accurate information upon the subject, It appears that the monetary pressure which had recently prevailed had been at first attributed to the system upon which the banks in those two countries were conducted; but in dealing with that question he should confine his observations to the management of the banking establishments in Ireland, Athough he was of opinion that whatever he might have to say of those establishmentsmight, muta* mutandiq, be aplied to banks in Scotlan. Of the banks In Ireland he tha t te ucmagn aset withoutt fear of c-ontradiction, that to the manner In which they were conducted the inconveniences which had arisen on this side of the water could with justice neither directly nor indireotly be attributed. It had, however he must admit, been stated, with some degree of truth, that a pressure had been produced upon the banks of this country in consequence of demands made upon them from Ireland. That pressure, however, he must contend, bad not been the result of indiscreet trading or of iDjudicious banking operations, inasmuch as during the recent crisis there had not been an instance in Ireland of suspension of payment upon the part of even a single bank. Hle was not, however, prepared to deny that the state of the lawi tespeettobankingtra3sactionsbetween England and Ireland waa not such as to require alteration. When Lord Spencer introduced his Bill containing whe4 was called the Bank Charter Act of that day, he introduced a claus which he very erroneously and very unscientifically called the legal tender clause. That designation, without firtherexplanation, would seem to imply that Lord Spencer bad sanctioned the Principle that, without qualification or restriction, the Bank of England notes were to be made a legal tender. Such a step, however, would have been entirely contrary to the opinions entertained by Lord Spenoer. Wbat that nobleman did ssume was that a banknote convertible on demand into gold was equivalent to gold so loDg as the convertibility was strictly and practicaUly maintained. Upon that assumption, therefore. a clause was introduced allowing a banknote to be a legal tender in all case except on the part of the Bank of England itself. That was the strict limitation which Earl maintained, and their lordships would observe r so long as the Bank of England were bound to pay their notes on demand in specie, and so long as that proimise to pay was performed, it could be no breach of faith or violation of principle that parties indebte should hzve the power of paying either it' sPecie or in notes, which, being convertible, were equivalent to speOie. Butt to'show with what strictness Lord Spencer carried out that view, he introduced Into the vary clause in question a limitation, reciting that theme Bank of England tnotes should not serve as a legal tender exoept so long as the Bank palid its notes in cciie The instant there was an interruption in that payment the power of discharging public or prirate engagements by notes was to cease. This had been the state of the law in relation to Bank of England notes throzghout England and Wales from that time to the present. But the clause of the Act was somewhat ambiguously worded. It did not appear from the language of the clause that its operation, or that of the Act itself, wis to be confined withln England and Wales. About tke year 1837, however, a very considerable failure occurred in Ireland-that of an establishment called the Agricultural and Commercial Bank-which was exceedingly il-managed, and which, indeed, deserved to fall. He Lord Monteagle) was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, an application wam mnade to him, on the part of theIrish Banking interest, a i to the applicability of the legal tender clause to Irish transactions, He took the opinion of the law officers of the Crown on the subject, and it was their opinion that the Act did not apply to Ireland. Arrangements were however made by the Treasary of the day which gave caurrency to Bauk of England paper paid for revenue purposes in Ireland, and thus affordea very great relief to the existing distress. So the law stood until the Government of Sir Peel In 1845 (the year after the Bank Charter Act) introduced two Bills for Ireland and Scotland, into the formerof which a clause was inserted, reciting that doubts had been entertained with respect to the applicabilty of the legal teader clause in the original Actto Ireland, aud enacting that Bank of England notes should not be received as a legal tender in that country. That wa the state of the law at the present moment, and what was the consequence! Why, that at any time of general pressure, like that which had lately taken place, there must be, upon the oentral point from which all monetary transactions prooeeded, a verygreat pressure2ndeed, and considerable sums of specie must inevitably be exported from Englaud to Ireland and Sootland. It was the object of the papers for which he intended to move to exemplify theese transactions. Had the legal iender clause extended over the whole kingdom these difficulties might to a great extent have been met by a transmission of convertible paper in the place of spec:e, In that case we might have realized wvith respect to Ireland I and Scotland the benefits extended to England by EBrl Spencer's clause; and he was at a loss to know what earthly reason operated to rew2re a different rule in Bristol aud Liverpool from that vn2ch prevailed at Waterford and Glasgow. The only objection which oould be raised was, that the legal tender clause In Ireland and Scotland would not produee the same benefits, owing to the existence there of a small note circulation. Now, he admitted that the effect of the law might not be extly the same in these countries, but he could not understand how any one could doubt that it would. as far as it went, be productive there of great good. It was a curious phenomenon that, throughout the late banking crisis, in the south of Iredand (he could speak of that district from his own experience, but believed that what he was about to sy would applyequallyto the wholeof Ireland) there had not been the least pressure with respect to the note circulation. The demand of the people was for their deposits, and it did not seem to matter whether these I were paid in gold or in notes. There was another remedy suggested, namely, the abolition of the small note circula. tion; but into the merits of this proposal he would not now enter. For the present he would confine hlmself to movng for returns showing the ciculation and bullion of the banks of Ireland and Scotland, in continuation of returns previously made on the same subject. Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY said, there was no ob'action to the production of the returns for which the noble lord had moved, asthey were mere continuations of returns which had been laid before the Bank Committee of last year. His noble friend had dwelt with very just satsfaction upon the manner in which the convertibility of banknotes had been maintained by the Irish bankers during the rocent crisis. At the same time, considerable inconvenience was occasioned to the Bank of England by the great demand for gold which was made at a time of pressure, In order to enable the banks of Irelard and Scotland to meet their small note circulation; and undoubtedly that inoonvenience would be obviated to a great extent by making Bank of England notes a legal tender in those oountries. Whe objecI tions to such a measare had, however, of imated with the bankerg of thoese countries, who were afraid that their own Issues might be superseded by Bank of England notes. He agreed with his noble friend that it was most desirable that the Government should seriously consider whether some alteration of the existing law In this respect might not b3 made. The motion was then agreed to, and Their lordships adjourned at a quarter past 6 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, THxsmy, Dzo. 10. The SPrZx5R took the chair at 4 o'clock. Mr. BARING took the oaths and his seat for Thetford. Petitions were presented by Sir J. SHBLLny, from wqrk. men in Mr. John Jay's emrloy, at Thames-bank Wharf, praying for the abolition of- the toll for foot-pasengers on the new bridge leading to the new park at Battersa. and from 266 inhabitants of Pimtlco, to the same effect; also, a petition, silgned by 424 inhabitants of Belgravia and Bel. gravia South, complaining of the nuisance to them and to their famlies by certain foreigners ginding barrel and other rgans in the streeta for the purpose of obtaining money, .omplaining of the want of uor'er under the Police Act for the removal of the nuisance, and praying for redress; and by Sir E. LYr'rON, from Lieutenant Morimon, praying for revard to persons vho save lives from shipwreck round there coasts Mr. WISE presented a petition from the British Inhabitants of Calcutta and the Bengal Chamber of Commerce praying for the removal of the government of Indla from the East Indiu Company and the substitution of the direct government of Her Majesty the Queen. On the motion of the hon. member, the petitionwas read itlength by the clerk at the table. THE WESTMISTER BELL. Mr. BOWYER asked the First Commisstoner of Works what was the result of the inquiry regarding the cracking of the great bell, and whether the founders were to pay tl e expense of the new bell; also, whether the new bel was to be warranted sound and durable by Messrs. Mears, the bellfouzders. Sir B. HALL, in reply, sdd he had put himself In communication on this subject with Mr. . B. Denison, who probably knew more about bells than any man In Europe; and he thought he could not do better than read the reply which Mr. Denisoa had kindly sent him. It was as follows:- " 42, Queen Anne-street, Dec. 9. My dear Sir,-The cause of the cracking of the great bell was correctly stated in 2%se %ime. of the 19th of November. *' Through some mistake or acident, which the founders say they cannot account for, the waist (or thin part of the bell) was made 1J inch thicker than I desiged it. The consequence was that it reauired a clapper of 12 Owt. instead of 7 to bring the full souna out; and although the sound. bow or stidking part of the bell bore this clapper for nearly a year, it gave way at last. "If the bell had cracked when it was first tried with this clapper the founders would undoubtedly have had to recast it at their own expense, as they had engaged to make it according to my drawings, and in fact had refused (as yoa know) to undertake the job unless I would take the responsibility of designing all the bells. But as it seemed to be able to bear this large clapper, even when puUed by 10 men, and was generally approved, Mr. Taylor and I did not feel justified in withholding our oertificate on accontt of the deviation from the prescribed thickness, weight, and note; for the quarter-belis were not then made, and could as easily be adapted to the note E natural as to E flat, which I had intended the great bell to be. Moreover, we were quite satisfied of the soundness of the casting by various tests, and, therefore, Messrs. Warner were paid, and cannot now be fixed with the cost of recasting. " It is right, however, to add that this recasting wiUl not bring the whole cost of the bells above the original estimate, as it included a large margin for contingenoies on account of the obvious risk of casting five such bells as these in tune with each other, the smal.est of them being as heavy as the largest bell of an ordinary modern peal, and the largest 15 times as heavy. There is no further rlsk now, as the quarter. bells are all cast, and only exceed my estimate of 8 toos weight by 291b. "1 The new bell Is to be delivered sound by the 19th of February, and is not to be paid for until it has bean tried by ringing with a 7cwt. clapper, nor unless it agrees with the prescribed dimensions, composition, and speoific gravity. Nothing more can be done to secure its goodness and its durAbility. I I The best bells in the world, such as the old Great Tom of Lincoln, sometimes crack quite capriciously, while very bad ones, such as Great Tom of Oxford sometimes obstinately last a great deal too long. "The great bell of the Roman Catholic Cathedral at Mffontreal cracked in about a year after it was hung. So, in that respect, we are no worse off than ether people; and, luckdly, our bell was not hung before it cracked. " Yours truly E.B'DENISON. "The Right Hon. Sir B. Hal, Bart, I & COMMON LAW COMMISSIONERS' REPORT Mr. WARREN asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether any steps have been taken by the Government to carry into effect any of the recommendations of the Common Law (Judicial Business) Commissioners, in their report of the 31st of July last, particularly with reference to the proposed alterations in the existing circuits of the judges; whether all or any of such recommendations a.re to be carried into effect by Act of Par- liament or by authority of the Executive Government, and in the former case, when the Bill for that purpose will be introduced, and in the latter, when an official announce. maent of the contemplated changes will be made 9 Sir G. GREY replied that the report of the commissioners had been received, and that he had since addressed a letter to the Lord Chief Justice, who was at the head of the commission, stating the views which the Government entained upon the subject. Perhaps the best course would be to lay that letter before the House, and if the hon. and learned gentleman moved for it it would be produced. Only be mad c f alimn, an,d with regard tdon LAND TRANSPORT CORPS. On the motion of Mr. T, DUNC03ME an address w&3 agreed to for a copy of the instructions given by the War Department to the board appointedI to investigate the clatims Preferred bynOn.comnmisajoned officers, artif"e~, or pri-s vates In the late Land Transport Corps, together with the namnes of the officers or others constituLting the said board EAST INDIA. -ADDITIONAL TROOPS, 2Xr.

CONVEYANCE OF TROOPS TO INDIA. Sir J. PAKINGTON moved for and obtained an order for copies of all correspondence that has taken place with reference to the conveyance of troops to India by way of Egypt, either between Her Majesty's Government and the Court of tirectors of the EAst Indis Companv, or between Her Majesty's Government or the Court of Directors and the Peninsular and Oriental, the European and Americau, or other steam packet compAnies. EAST INDIA (ADDITIONAL TROOPS). On the motion of Mr. W. VANI AliT there were ordered to be lbid on the table copies of any recommendation or despatches, during the Governor-Generalsp of India by the MarqTis of Dalbousie, received by the Court of Directors or by the President of the Board of Control from the Supreme G-overnment or Commander-inchief in India, for an increase of European troops, subsequent to the acquisition of the Pun ab, Pegu, Nagpore, Oude, Sattar, JhlnsL Berar, or other disticts, and the replies to the same; and also of any paper showing the number of additional troops sent. THE CURRENCY.-CAUSES OF MIERCANTIE DISTRESS. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCBEQUER-I beg to give notice that, in the event of the House acceding to tha motton 'for the appointment of a committee of which Ihave given notice for to-morrow night, I shall move that " it be an inatrnction to the committee to inquire into the caunes of the recent mercantile ditres3, and also to inquire how far It has been affected by the laws regulating that banknotes shall be payable on demand." Mr. DISRAELI.-I wish to give notice of the amend. ment which it is my intention to move to-morrow to ths motion of which the ChanceUor of the Exchequer gave notio a few nights ago. What I propose Is to move as an amendment to the motion of the Chmeellor of the Exchequer - " That in the opinion of this Iouse no farther inquiry i, necessary into the operation of the Bank Act of 1844, 7th and 8th Victoria, chap. 32." The words I have used are thoseused as an instraction to the committee of la; seesion. LTABILITY OF BANKING COMPANIES. M1r. HEADLAM gave notioe that after the Christmas recss he should move that banks be placed upon the same footing as other companies in regard to tlmited liability. ELECTION PETITIONS. Mr. A. STEUART wished to ask the Secretaxy of State for the Home Department whether Her Majesty's Governiment have had under their consideration the law regardin the procedure on election petitions, and will be prepared either to introdutce a measure after the recess, or to agree to the appointment of a, select committee to inquire into the whole sabiecX Sir G. GREY said that in the oourse of the discunsions upon this subject lmt sesion he had expressed an opinion that it was very desirable that. any neW legislation u no the law regulating the trial and withdrawal of eleoidn petitions should be preceded by a careful inquiry into the existing practice. H[e therefore thought It expedient that a committee shonld be appointed during the present session to conduct this investigation. PROBATE COURT (IRELAND). Mr. HATCHEELL (in the abeence of Mr. DEAsY) asked when it was intended to bring into operation the Act of last sossion relative to probates and letters of administration In Ireland,; and also whether it was intended to provide for the sitting of the new Court of ProbAte in the Immediate vicinity of the Four Courts. Mr. FITZGERALD said the Act would come inte operation on the 11th of January next. It was intended to provide for the sitting of the new Court in the vicinity of the Four Courts, and temporary acommodation would be found so as to meet the public wishes in that respect SAVINGS-BANKS. lffr. COLLINS asked whether Her Majesty's Government intended to bring in a Bill with reference to savings-banks, or to appoint a select committee to consider the whole snbject, including the appropriation of uavings.banks securities for purposes other than those required for answering the draughts of the trustees of such institfona The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-It is not my intention to ask leave this session to bring in a Bill upon the subject of savings-banks, but it is my intention, unless I find the House should offer any objection to that course, to move after5the holydays, that the whEole questions of avingsbanka-including the appropriation of savingsbanks r*curities, adverted to by the hon. membershallbe referred to a select comamittee. I will move that thelaw rclating to ravings-bank hbe referrod to a select comamittee. REFORMATORY SCHOOLS. Mr. GARNETT wished to know whether it was the Intention of the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education to cancel the minute dated the 2d day of June, 1856, so far as it related to reformatory schools, certified by the Secretary of State under the Act 17th and 18th Victoria, cap. 86; and if so, whether It was intended that the 7s. per week at present allowed by the Home-office for the care and maintenance of each inmate detained under sentence in any such reformatory school should be the only public money granted for such purpose . Mr. COWPER said that the time appeared to have come when Reformatory Schools ought to be plced on a more permanent footing. The Home-office had appointed a special inspector for Reformatory Schools, and it was desrablethat the vote4 to these schools should be distributed throegh a single department, instead of two. Reformatory Schools were now able to obtain important aid from borough aad county rates, and it had become necessary that the minute of June 2, 1856, should be greatly altered and modified. For wome months past no new Reformatory Schools had received the grants of the Committee of Council on Edueation, and notice had been given that after a limited period to be named the existing reformatories would cease to receive thee grants altogether. STATE OF THE THAMES. Mr. ADDERLBY wishad to ask the First Commlssioner of Works whether any report had been made by Mr. Guraey in reply to the reference which he promised to make to him on the subject of the state of the Thames opposite the louses of Parliament; and, if such a report had been made, whether he would lay it on the table of the House. Sir B. HALI-Mr. Gurney presented a report to me a day or two ago, and if the hon. gentlomen desires that It should be laid on the table I have no objection. THE AUTHORS OF THE TEL1EGRAMS. Mr. LYGON should be glad to hear from the Presiden' of the Board of Control on whom rested the responsibility of providing that the intelligence transmitted by electric telegraph to thin country from the East Indies should represent as acourately as possible the detailed information conveyed by the malls. Mr. V. SMITH said that when the telegrams were frst sent some confusion arose in tranSmitting the intelligence. Orders had, however, been sent to the Secretaries of the Governmentin India to transmit of6cial telegras, which I had been very diligently compiled and carefully selected. It had happented occasionally that the telegrams were not in [ tine; and then the summary was tranamitted by the Consuls, who aso exercised great care. There were. hoever, coca. slons when misakfes in Indian names were made. TROOPS FOR INDIA. Sir J. .PAXINGTON wished to know whether it was trae that Lord Elphinstone telegraphed to Lord Canning'that he had steamvessels at Bombay which he would send, If deeired, to Saez, to facilitate the conveyance of troops overland to India. Mr. V. SMITHE-We have no information of smch a tele- having been transmitted by Lord hinstone to Lord 9a8n2R. I do not think it very Ikely that Lord Elphinstone would send such a message, s I have a private letter from himn, in which he speaks of the difficulty of providing transport, all the transport he could furnish having been required for the Persian war, and being then in the P ersian Gulf. He also speaks of the danger of navigating the Red Sea at that particular season. It is not very likely that Lord Elphinstone would propose to do what he said in his letter to me was difficult, and almost impossible. I cannot, however, say that sulch a message was not sent. THE CLIVE FUND. Sir J. PAKINGTON said It would perhaps be convenient to the President of the Board of Control to answer the question relative to the Clive Fund to which he alluded yesterday. He wished to ask the right hon. gentleman what was the present state of a fund of 70,0001., created by a donation of Lord Clive in 1765, who paid a legacy which he received to that amount Into the East India Company's Treasury at Fort WiUliam, to be at interest for the sunport of European officers and soldlers who might be disabfed or decayed In the Company's service in Bengal, and for the widows of officers and soldiers who mght die on ervice tere. Mr. V. SMITH said that he wrote yesterday to the aocontant of the East India House to furnish him with a detailed account in figures relative to this fund. It had not, however, arrived when he came down to the House. As to lhe state of the fund, the best answer he oould give was to refer the right hon. gentleman to the evidence of Sir Philip Melville before a committee of the House, in which he stated that the Clive Fund had been superseded as to European offlcers by the grant of retired half-pay by the Company to a greater amount than was provided by the fund. Both the principal and interest of the fund had long been exhausted, and the pensions were now supplied by the Company. TROOPS FOR INDIA. Mr. ADDEBRLEY asked whether any more regiments thin the 95th, 89th, and 13th had been sent from the Cape to India; whether the 89th were not under orders for New Zealand, and the 95th relieving them; whether the two regiments so deducted from the forces at the Cape were all the set off against the addition of the German Legion on full pay, equal to four regiments in strength; and whether the to result of an increase of forces at the Cape by two regiments; was wholly at the expense of this country. Mr. LABOUCHERE.-I propose to-morrow to lay upon the table a paper which will give the House full information with regard to the conduct of the governors of colonies In the vi9lty of India when they received direct intelligence of the recent revolt. I refer to the Governors of Ceylon, the Maurtius, and the Cape of Good Hope. With regard to the Governor of Ceylon, I may state that Sir HI. Ward, having received a despatch from the Governor-General of India, stating that he should be glad to have every soldier he could spare, did send to India almost every European soldier in the colony, aud thereby afforded most effectual Rssistance to the Governor-GeneraL Lord Elphinstone ECnt an officer in a vessel to the Mauritius, and thence to the Cape, to ask for succours. The G.,vernor of'the Mauritinu sent one regiment and a company of ArtUlery, which, conidering the state of that colony, mus', I think, bave included every soldier who could po&.ibly be spared for the assistanoe of India. (Hlear, hear.) WLth regaxd to the Cape, Sir George Grey, the Governor, sent three regiment at on0e to India - twro only of those regiments belonged to the Caee establihment, the other was oa its way to New Zealand, Dut Sir George Grey very properly took upon himself the responsibility of diverting it; and I can asure the hon. gentleman that he is mistaken if he suppoes that Sir George Grey's efforts to send succoar to Indawverermited to thoie Ih voedescribed. At the satne time Sir George Grey sent two companies of Artillery, and knowing that there vas a great want of specie at Bombay, he remitted 60,000Z. from the colonial chest, which was nrost Eatefully received by the Government of India. (Hear.) The hon. gentleman asks if he has since sent further suecours to India. I have this morning received a letter from Sir George Grey, ia which he states that he has sent another regiment, the 80th, to Ceylon. Whether the whole will remain at Ceylon or any part go on to CalcUtta ±am not aware ; but at any rate he has sent that regiment practically for the strvice of India. (Hear). With regard to another most important mode of renderlng assistanoe, Sir. George Grey, with his usual promptitude and esergy, anticipating orders which I had sent (that be should immediately suppl 1,000 horses for the same servioe), had began at once, an id by the letter reoeived to-day, had either prepared for embarcwtion, or already caused to be embarked 1,000 horsee, of which 500 or 600 were taken from corpe, and therefore already trained. Indeed, the number of horses sent by Sir George Grey from the Cape befor receiving any orders from home eems only to have been 11 mited by the amount of forage which ceuld be obtained to send :with them. (Eear, hear.) WhUe mentioning this I cannot forbear alluding to the manner in which the colonists of the Cape have come forward to support the Government on this occaion. (Rear, hear.) Sir George Grey erites that, in order to enable him to send rnore troops, the Inhabitants of Cape Town volunterea to do garrison duty in that colony when it was more than usually onerous, because the town wa fahll of Caffre prisoners. (Hear, hear.) Auming that the hon. gentleman means to infer that, oonsidering the large number of troops at the Cape, more succours can be sent to India, It only remains for me to say that what Sir George Grey has hitherto done has been witbout any precise instruotions, and that some months ago, by command of the Govern. ment, I sent instractions to him to despatch six regiments to India, wnless some very novel and unexpected circum. stanoes should arise in the oolony maLing it neceswary to retain a larger force. I hAve every reason to believe that Sir George Grey wll act upon these instructions. I have the utmost confidence in the promptitude, spirit, en.e and. discretion of Sir George Grey and I am yertFt satisfied he will glve every aistance in his power. rCheers.) As an instance of zeal on the part of the Cape coloistg, I may state that Sir George Grey and the leadiug men gave up their own prilate horses, and the inhabitants generally sold their horses at the usl prices, not allowing them to be affected by this unusual demand. (Hear.) I believe that the Cape colonists have, in every manner co. operated with the public authorities In asssig the service of the country. (Cheersv) M1LITARY AUDITOR. General CODRINGTON uked the Under-Secretary for War whether in the office lately established-viz, that of "military auditor," attached to the troops in China-any separate authority was given independent of, and with financial oontrol over, the general offioer in command of the troops; wvhether the expenditure required on active service in the field must not neessrily, as heretofore, be decided on the sole responsibility of the general officer; whether those persons employed in the office of military auditor with the troops in China were amenable to, or independent of, the provisions of the Mutiny Act. SirJ. RAISDEN could &asre his hon. and galLan fziend thattheappointment of the militaryauditorattachod to the troops In China would not in any way interfere wita the authority of the general inoommand of the forces. The duties ofa a military anditor were to audit accounts, to settle claims, and to be a referee on all points of financial regulation in the army; and it was expected that, by his assistance, references home of minor points would be avoided. In the instructions to the military auditor it was pArticularly stated that he would exercise his functions subject to the directions and instructions of the general commanding the forces; but perhaps it would be maore satisfactory if he were to lay a oopy of those instractions on the table, which he should ask leave to do on that evening. (Eear, hear. Withregard to the question whether the persons employed in the office of military auditor would be amenable to the provisionsof the Mutiny Act, his answer was that all persons cocnnected with the War Depatent, whea employed under the command of a genreral of ficer In the field, were, by the second clause of the Multtiny Act, brought nnder thae provisions of that Act. (Hlear, hear,) THE FRINDLY OFFERS OF FOREIGN POWEBRS. Slr J. PAE1NGTON.-I will now ask the First Lord.of the Treaury the questions of which I have given notice - Whether it is true that Lord Strtford de Redeliffe telegraphed to Her Majestys Government that he had obtained a firman from the Sultan for the passage of troops through Egypt to India, and, if so, what was the date of that communication5 Perhaps the noble lord will allow me to ask another queation, of which I have not given him notice. It js-whether it is within his knowledge that, by the joint influence of Lord Stratford de Redeliffe and 3I. Thtvenel, the French Ambassador, a firman was actually obtained from the Porte for the passage of French troops to Pondicherry through Ept ? I will also ask what was the date of the friendly offer made to Her Majesty's Government by the Emperor of the French to permit British troops to pass through France on their way to India? Lord PALMERSTON.-I wir first answer the second question, with respect to the application said to have been made by the Britsh and French Ambassadors for the passage of French troops to Pondicherry. We have no knowledge of any such app'ication, and I do not believe that French troops did go across Egypt. (Hear.) With regard to the first question, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe on the 30th of June informed the Government by telegraph that he would apply to the Turkish Government to Allow troop; to pa6s through Egypt on their way to India If the British Go. vernment thought it advisable that that course should be pursued. On the 2d of July he was informed that it was not the intention of Her Majesty's Government at that time to send any troops through Egypt; and perhaps I may be allowed to state shortly the reasons. To send a large body of troops, as was then Intended to be sent, through Egypt, would have required complicated arrangements, and taken upinfiitely more timae than would have been saved. If we sent, for instance, 5,000 men to Alexandria for the purpose of going thronSh Egypt, there would be great difficulty in transporting so large a number of troops across the Desert. When they arrived at Suez, unless there were ample shipping to take them down the Red Sea, there would be a great delay at a place where there would be no poasible means of putting them nnder proper cover. They would also be exposed to very severe heat in the passage down the Red Sea, which might render them unfit for service when they arrived in India. Moreover, as they would have required a very large amount of shlpping to be ready at Suez, it would have been quite tnpardonable In the Government to have sent them there until they knew that there were sufficient transports at Snez. It would also have been necessary to send them through Egypt in light marching order ; whereas, sending them by siea, we 'were able to send them with baggage, stores of all kinds, and guns. They would arrive in good health, and when landed, would be perfectly ready for any service that might be required of them. There was another coUateral reason, which, upon a balance of equal advantages, would be calculated to turn the scale. In a national point of view it was of importance in patting down the mutiny that we should do it with our own means in every respect, and that it should not be competent for any foreign nation to say that if it had not been for certain facilities afforded us by friendly Powers, which might have been withheld, we should not have been able to accomplish our purpose. (Hear.) I do not mean to say that if there had been a great difference in point of advantage In favour of one route over the other such a reason ought to prevail, but when the balance was against the overland passage that consideration was entitled to be taken into account. (Hear, hear.) On the 2d of October, when the season had moderated, when the great bulk of the troops had been sent, and the Government had occasion to send smaller detachinents, the pae of which wass-ore easy. Lord Stratford was desired to as the formal permission of the Porte and the Pasha of Eypt. The permissiion was obtained. and in the first place two companies were sent across Egypt to reinforce the garrison at Mden. Some Artillery and E3ngineers have been sent Lo Calcutta and Bombay since, and from that time we have been sending detachment4 or regi- mnents, which are now on their way by that route. (Hear, hear.) The right hen. gentleman asks what was the time when the French Government made their offer of a paSage through France. That was on the Sih of October, and at that time the bulk of the troops had gone. AlthouRh the offer did great credit to the friendly disposition of the French Government, and we are very grateful to them for It, we thought that thG difficulties of a land passage, and of landing and reshipping the troops with their arms and baggage, rendered it better that they should go round at onoe by Gibraltar than paSs through France. (Hear.) THE COMMERCE OF THE BLACK SEA Mr. WISE asked the First Lord of the Treasury whother the regulations for admion into the Russian ports of the Blc Sea had been framed in a spirit favourable to the development of commercil transactions, and to whst ports in the Black Sea English Consuls had been sent by Her Majesty's Government? Lord PALME3RSTON.-I cannot say that the arrangements which have been made by the Russian Government for promoting commercial Interconrse on the eastern coast of the Black Sa, as at present framed, are in accordance with the spirt of the Treaty of Paris. We are told, however, that those arrangements are only temporary, and that when the Russian Government have established custom-houses in the various ports that they will proceed to open them for commereial intercourse. At present there are but three ports, Souchum-Kaleh and two others, to which we could send consuls. Mr. WISE said, that if the noble lord would name the ports to which consuls had been sent the information woould he very frateful to the Britsh merchants interested in that trade, who were at present in entire ignoranoe on the matter. Lord PALMERSTON,-Their Ignorance Is not at all inexcusable, seeing that no consuls have been sent. My noile friend at the head of the Foreign-office has been waiting to get information, whish has oDly recently reached himi, in order to enable him to determine which are the ports to which it would be advisable to send consuls. I believe my noble friend has pretty well made up his mind, but until the appointments are made I cannot state the I orts to which the consuls will be sent. TEB STADE DUES. br. FENWICK asked the Ftrst Lord of the Treasury whether Her Majesty's Government had been in Regobiation with the Government of Hanover, with a view so the extinction of the Stado Dues; and if so, what progres had i been made in the negotiation; and whether any amsurance could now be given of an early and satisfactory settlemnent of the question? LordPALMERBSTON.-The Stade Dues are of the same nature as the Sound Does, and, though it would no doubt be very desirable to get rid of them, that can only be done by i negotiations, not with Hanover alone, but in concert with many other Governmentts interested in the tatter. We have had communications for the purpose, but they have not yet come to such a point as to enable me to say that there is an Immediate prospect of getting rid of the dues. Being of the same nature as the Sound daes, of course they can only be got rid of in the same way-by compensation. MARKETS AND FAIRS IN IRELAND. In answer to Lord F. CoNYGoFA,31 Mr. HERBERT said, it wa the intention of the Govern. ment to introduoe a measure this aeseion for the regulation of enarkets and fairs in Ireland. TEB BRITISEI ENGINEERS AT NAPLES. Lord J. RUSSELL asked whether the noble lord at the headoftheGovernment had looked at the letter of the Britlth Vice-Consul at Naples in referenoe to the treatment of the two engineers in prisn there, and whether he would lay it on the table T Lord PALMEESTON.-Ths letter has aldy been laid on the table. JEWISH DISABILITIES. On the motion of Lord I. RusszLL the Houe resolved itsef into a committee to consider the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, and to consider the disAbilitles affectlng Her Majests Jewish subjects. Lord J. RUSSELL (who was very indistinctly heard) aid,-I am glad to be able to assare the commaittes that I shall not have occasion to detain it for any length of time, as this subject has been so frequently under discnion, and the House of Commons has recently heard a very able statement on it from my noble friend when introducing his BQI, of lat ssion. The oommittee Is weU aware that the principle of our legislation is not to disqualify any man f ot legiative fonctlons or for the possession of office on zaoouont of religious oplinons. That prindple has been estblihed both with regard to Protestant Dlssenters and Roman Catholics, although In those instances there were political objeeftons, which operated in former times, but which do not apply to the Jews. The committee is also aware that there is no positive enactment affeoting Her Majest's Jewish subjects, that their exclusion is only owing to the constrction put upon the oath of abjurationl and that that oath was not orlginally intended for that purpose, eo that the persons refusdng the oath of abjuration, viz., 40,000 of Her Majesty's Jewish subjects, are treated in the ame way as 40,000 Poplsh recasants I shall not touch upon the general reasons for religious freedom. Those resons, as I have sid before, stad recorded In the statut book; nor shall I go into the reaons for altering the present oath, which upon the fee of it is exceedingly absurd, and pledges maembers of this House not to support the claims to the throne of persons who have no existence I will, therefore, state at once what is the nature of the Bill which I propose to introduce. The Bil of last year contained a dmple form of oath, not similar to the one which I intro. dueed in 1848-which could be token by all members of this House-but an oath which could be taken by all persons who were not of the Roman Catholic persuasion. Tbat is the oath which I propoee to introduce on the present occasion, but I proposo to add to the words of that oath the words contained in the present oath, " This I declare on the true faith of a Christian." The reason why I propose to Introdnoe those words is that, having been long in se, they have got a sort of prescriptive value in the eyes of many, and also that one of the most eminent supporters of Jewish claims, the right hon. gentlemanthe member for Buckinghamshire, has more than once expressed his opinion that those words should be retained in the oath. I propose, of course ya subeequent clause, that whenever one of Her Majesty's Vewish sub ects oomes to take the oath those words shall be omitted, Hear, hear.) It follows, of course in a more logical way than from the BiU which my noble irlend introduced lat sesion, that Jews would be disabled from holdinz certain ofJfies which canot be held by Roman Catholics. I do not pror to put Jews in a superior position to Romun Catholics, but to give them the same privileges (Hear, hear.) There is another question upon which I cannot refrain from touching for a few moments It so happened that in 1847, after the debate which took place upon the suspension of the Bank Charter Act, on the 10th or 11th of December, I introduced this Bill, or at least a similar Blll on this subject. That BiI and other Bils for the same purpose have been rejected by the other House of Parliament, and I think the question may be fairly asked what prospect is there of this Bill being more favourably received by the other House than its predecessors ? (Hear, hear.) To that question I should answer, In the first place, that I have drawn the Bill in the most conciliatory form posdble; that this House has at all times-except onoe, when I proposed to extend the oath to Roman Catholics-affirmed the principle of religious liberty; that last year the majority of this ouse was far greater than It had been before; and that In the whole course of our history repeated deesisions of this House by considerable majorities with respect to any matter of internal policy have always had great weight with the other House. But I do not wish to conceal from the House my intentions upon this subject. At the end of last session I ws informed that the learned Attorney-General was of opinion that the Act of the 5th and 6th of WiUiam IV. entitled this House to frame a declaration to be taken in place of the oath if it should so think fit. (Hear, hear,) On hearing that opinion from so eminent and distinguished an authority as the Attorney-General, I thought It right to have the question examined by a select committe of this House. The House consented to the nomination of that committee, and in it the question ws very fuUy debated. No witnesses were examined, but the subiect was debated by gentlemen belonging to the legal profession and bF other members of the oommittee with much ability and in great detail, The result of the disenssion was unfavourble to the position of the Attorney-General, but at the same time the majority against that position was a very narrow one, consisting of one only of the original members of the committee, and of two of the gentlemen of the long robe who had been added to it. The right hon. baronet the member for Droitwich had prepared a motion which he wished to propose,butwhicb, owing totheform observed incommittees, could not then be proposed, His motion was to the effect that the Houses of Parliament were included in the Act of Willism IV.; but that it was not expedient to use the power conferred by that Act unless It should appear that there was no other constitutional mode by vhich the object in viewmight be accomplished. It was not my duty, being chairman of that committee, to express any opinion, or to take any part in its dlscussions;but'crta..irly, if I had been called upon to give an opinion, it would have exactly coincided with that of the right hon. baronet the member for Drotwich. Such being my opinion, it is unnecessary now to enter into the argument on the subject I wiU only say that that argument was stated with almont more than his usual learning and ability by the AttorneyGeneral, and that the motion which he made, "that tie words included the Eouses of Parliament," met with the concurrence not only of the right hon. memaber for Droit. wich, but also of the right hon. member for Bnckingham. shire, the noble lord the member for Lynn, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, and many other distinguished members of this House. Fortified by those opinions, and convinced by the argnments which were used, I should not think it right to a ow this question to drop altogether without giving the House an opportunity of considering whether or not they will adopt the proposition of a declaration instead of an oath to be taken by members who may object to certain words in that oath. I must confess that my opition Is, that we have been perhaps somewhat negligent in allowIng the subject of the seat of a member of this House to be discussed, as it has been, in the courts of law. My belief is that it is a question, which by the constitution of the country, the courts below are hardly competent to decide; and, as it would be impossible for them to entertain the question whether a member who was elected to this Rouse bad been duly elected, so likewise it is not competent for them to decide whether the oaths have been properly taken. Such was the principle on which the House of Lords acted in the case of Lord Wensleydale. (Hear.) Some persons may think that they were right in the decision at which they arrived; others may think that they were wrrong ;nt nobody has dispmuted the competency of the HIouse of Lords to act as they did-nobody has denied that they were perfectly able, after Her Majesty bad by letters patent created a peer, to decide whether that peer hxd a right_to take his seat in thn House of Lords. In like masnier I believethat we are fully competent to decide whether a member who has taken the oatb, or the declaration, as the case may be, is eligible to sit in this House. (Hear.) That, however, is not the question at present. My object is to bring in a Bill, and to endeavour to obtain to it the assent of the whole Legilature; but at the same time I shall not be prepared to abandon the rights of the House of Commons, as they have been ably stated by very high legal authorities, believing them to be in conformity with the liberty of the subject and with the privileges of this House. (Eear.) Sir, I beg | to move for leave to bring in aBill to substitute one oath for tile oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, and for the relef of Her Majesty's subjects professing the Jewish religon. (Hear.) Sir F. THESIGER believed that the noble lord who had just addressed the comnmittee understood that it had been arrranged that there should be no opposition offered to the introduotion of his Bill, or to its being read a first tlme, the noble lord, on his part, having engaged that he would not ask for a second reading until after Christmas ("Hear" from Lord J. Russell); and he (Sir F. Thesiger) must suggegt to his hon. friends, who agreed with him on this subject, that, considering the various shapes in which Bis had been from time to time introduced for the admission of Jews into Parliament, it was very desirable that they shonld see tat onee hat was the particular measure which was now proposed, in order that they might be enabled the more satisfactorily to discuss it after the recess. (Hmr, hear.) He could not help congratniating the noble lord opposite on having resumed hisnatural position on this question. In 1817, when the noble lord was fist returned for the city of London with Baron Rothschild, and when he gave a pledge from the hustings that he would introduce a meaure for the relief of the Jews, the subject seemed to belong as of right to him; but on the last two ocasions on which the question had been sub- mitted to the House the noble lord had been rathoir plaoed in the back ground. In 1856, owing, posibljr, to. the young and zealous advocutes for the admision of thor Jews being somewhat diassatisfied with the slowns of the' movements of the noble lord, 3jr. MltferGibson foreWM the noble lord in the introduction of mere, ad such wu the exuberance of that gentleman's zel that he pro. oeeded to the extremity ofendeavouting to get rid a1together of the oath of abjuratlon. The duty of the noble Ikrd upon that occasion wAs limited to corretffrg the ze of his amsociate, and, desiring to retain portiong of the Oath or abjuration, he introduced an amendmuent in committee by which a new oath of a biur*tion was to have been substituted. During the last seesion the noble lord fought undethe banners of the noble lord at the bead of the Governumnt; He (Sir F. Thesiger) believed that that course was adopted more from policy than from humility (a laugb), becauEe the noble lord w thus enabled to move the whole machine of the Government, and t, exert all its weight and influence in support of his darling object. The noble lord had now appeared again in the front of the battle, and he was happy to find that he was onca more treading in constitutional paths, though not without. some little glance at those indirect and crooked ways whicIh had been occasIonally attempted for the purpose of forcing the Jews on Parliament. (Hear, hear.) The noble lor(d did not now, indeed, threaten them with a resolution whilcz should seat the Jews in defiance of the House of Lords; b.t he bad adverted to that which was one of the moat extra. ordnary circumstances that had occurred among the variety of schemes which had been from tine to time proe fot that gurpose; and it appeared that he clan to te powe whic he presumed that the Act of William LV. would give him, and imagined that he should be enabled by its meang. to force the Jew upon the Tegisature in defianoe of the courts of law. He (Sir P. Thesiger) rnust confeXt that few things had struck him as more eAtraordi. nary than the discovery vhich was a11 at onoe made of that Act of ParliLment, whicb, altbough It hadbee.M overlooked for rmany years, Was supposed to afford a short cut to the object which so many persons had at heart. The suggestion altogether appeared tohin o strange that, though everyone admitted the great talent of the noble lord and his remarkable fertility of contrivance, he immediately ome to. the conclusion that some more acute and subtle mind hid propounded it to the noble lord. (Elear.) The noble lord hal now satisied them upn that point, and had told them that it was his hon. and learned frneid the Attorney-Genera to. whom it had first oocurred that that Act of Parliament, s long overlooked, would attain the obect wbich he hadin vieLw. Re could imagine the pleasure withT which this new 1ghtfasahed upon his eyes and the joyful haste with which he hurried to the noble lord with his Eureka (laughter)bhe (Sir F. Theslger) hoped not exactly in the state of the per. son from whom that exclamstion first proceeded. (Renewred laughter.) It wu sid that it very much enhanoed the' merits of an inventor or discoverer If the subject of discovery had been lying for a long time, as it were, upon the' surface, unperceived, although in sight of the world, until the happy moment when the discoverer soped as it vere, on the ground and pioked it up. But ihak sbould they say of the merts of the hon. and learned gentlemn, who, while gentlemen of ingenious ad anxous. minds who had had their thoughts turned continually irn this direction had entirely overlooked this wonder-workIlg Act of Parliament. lighted upon it and discoveredb that which had escaped the attention of so many otherst The noble lord had said that it might be necesary to revertto that Act of Parliament upon some future occasion if he, should not sacceed in a constitutional manner in obtaining the admission of the Jew to Parliament; but he thoghit that the noble lord would pause before he adopted a oour which would be socompnLied with so much danger, with the certainty of a collision with the courts of justioe, in whieh it wan not very ikely that that House would oome out of the contest with any credit to itself. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord had supposed that he found a precedent for the. application of this Act of Parliament without the inter. ference of the courts of law In consequence of what occurred! in the House of Peers with regard to the life peerage of lordi Wenale dale; but he (Sir F. Thesiger) was quite sure that the noble lord had not adverted to the distinctlon between. the two cases--viz., that the oaths which were required ta be taken by members of the Legislture were oaths which. were imposed by an Act of Parliament, and that there were penalties attached to persons who might sit and vote witu. out taLking those oaths. Now, if the words " upon the traue faith of a Christian" were an essential and substantial part; of the oath, as had been frequently decided, not merely by courts of law but by the determination of the noble lord himself, then the question whether a person sitting and voting in that House, having taken the oath with the omis. sion of thees words, was no' liable to a penalty, must neoessarlly oome before the courts. (Hear.) They all knewhow' the oourts maust decide that question. The noble lord hA adverted to the names of the genUtlemen who oomposed the committee, perhaps ratber invidiously. He brought forwardi on the part of the minority a number of Very distinguished names, for all of which he (Sib P. Theciger) had the very highest respect. But at the same time it was very iwrtaut that the commnittee should bear this in maind-he I looked very carefully through the division list of that coimittee, and he found on the part of that minority not one single name of any member who had not either for a very considerable time been favourable to the admieoon of Jews, or who had not been recently converted, converts being proverbially not the maot lukewarm in supporting their nevw opinions (LAughter.) And he also found this remarkable distinction existing between the majority and theminority-that among the majority were to be found at least five members of the House who had been in favour of the admisdion of the Jews (hear, hear), but who, not being satisfiedt that the construction which he had no doubt the Attorney. General had with the greatest posdble ingenuity endes. voured to put upon this Act of Parliament was the co:recl one, would not allow their wishes to influenoe their opinions, and pve their vote, which swelled the mnajority, and eaved the House, for a time at least, from all those perilous consequenoes which he anticipated from the course which the noble lord had darldy shadowed forth. (Cheers.) Let the House consider the position in which it stood with regard to this question. The noble lord spoke of religious liberty ixt general, and of religious liberty as far as the Jews were concerned, and upon a former occasion he had spoken of removing the last remnant of religious intolerance, or of placing the last stone upon the edifice of religions liberty. But, If he understood the proposition of the noble lord, he was not upon the present occasion. prepared tonlace the last stone upon the edifice of religious. liberty. What the noble lord now proposed to do wsar merely to crown tha,t edifice by a stone un favour of the Jew, leaving every other antiChistian still excuded. Now, he, did not know why, if the principle of the noble lord wa&the removal of all religious intolerance and the completi( a of the edifice of religious liberty, this tolerance should net extend to the Hindco and the lahomedan. (Cheers and counter cheers,) He heard a cheer, which he understood to be a cheer of approbstion of the principle that every" denomination of anti-Christian should be admnitted to a sest. In that House. (Cheers and counter cheers.) To be sure, considering the circumstances that were ocouring around! us-the feeling of hostility which was manifested againsb Christianity by the Hindoo and the Mahommedan, it did appear to him that the man who could entertain an idea of that kind nnust have extraordinary notions. (Hear, hear.) Of oourse, with regard to the Jew, he (Sir F. Thesiger) knew perfectIy well that whatever might be, nay must be, his latred to Christianity, he was not likely to rage so furiously as the be then, or to be guUty of the savage ferocityof tho Mahomedan; but if his feeling of hostility were as deep s theirs, was it a desirable thing to give him the power, by means of sea t in the legislature of the country, of effect. Ing in close design by fraud or guile that which by force he could not effect ? Nor would religions tolerance stop at the point to which those in favour of the admission of the EHindoo, and the Mahomedn vwould carry it. Their edifice of religious llberty would not be completed by the admission of theEindoo and the hishommedan as well as the Jew. Sappose the Atheist, the fool who said in his heart "There is no God" were to come (hear, hear), and to say, "Why do oUt oompel me by your oaths to profess with my lips the existence of Him whom in my heart I deny ' " would not he oomplain of your religious intolerance if you did not get rid of the oaths to accommodate what he called his con. scienoe? Well, then, the first step in that direction was taken by the noble lord. But their edifice of religious liberty was not uniform. They wanted many more stonesto oomplete it (cheers and counter cheers), and when they once admitted the principle for which the noble lord contended it was impossible that they could stop short. They must proceed to the end. They must sweep away all religlous distinctions (cheers and counter cheers), and admit every one without scruple and without hesitatian to a seat In that Hionse. It seemed, as the noble lord had said, that there were those who were anxious for that consummation. The noble lord, by the course be was adopting, would advance their views; and he (Sir P. Thesiger) most earnestly entreated hlm to pauses nd consider what the consequenoes would be, which his great. name and his high position in that Hnuse would have produced by the introduction of that which was treated only* _ a partl messure and an instalment of that which was due to the subject. (Hear, hear.) He felt strongly upon this question, and regretted that he had trespassed so long upon the attention of the House He might be still blinded by' those arguments which had been already urged, he miglt. be still bigoted and unyielding to them from a feeling of religious intoleranee, but he ws resolute in maintaininig the position to which he had always adhered, and in everystage of this Bill he would to the utmost of his ability resist the proposition which the noble lord sought to introduce. because he believed that by giving a seat to the Jew ia the Legislature of this country they would give a fatal blow to Christianity, which was intimately interwoven with everydepartment of the State, (Cheers) Mr. DILWYN believed that whenever a considerable. constituency had elected a person properly qualified to re. present them in the Legislature effect ought to be given to their choioe. This he tbought the House had power to do. by resolution; and for this reason ke had endeavourednot by any crooked course, as was insinuated by the hon. nd learned gentleman, but in an open and straightforwrd!; manner-to induce the House to proceed under the Act ot the 1t and 2d of Victoria, by omitting the words whichx pevented a Jew from taking his scat He had, however, given place to the noble lord the member for London, who. was so well entitled to take the lead on this question. Another Act bearing on this subject was the 4th and 5th of William IV., by vhich a declaration could be. substituted for an oath; but by whichever of these two Acts they proceeded they must not allow the, question to go up upon appeal to the House of Lords, wh cb was not competent to decide 'upon the privUeges of the Commons. It vas true the committee, by asmall majority. negatived the views of the Attorney.Geseral;bui, sanrun ber of the members did not attend to hear that hon. ana learned gentleman's arguments, their decision s not de serving of us much weight as mnight otherwise have bem attached to it. He did not doubt the power of the IHoneg to proceed by either or by both of the Acts above named. and it shbould be remembered that if the noble lord's BiO failed to pass, the House did not abandon its right to pro, ceed by resolution. After exhausting every means of cono ciiation, they would be bound to assert the right Oocrr n them bjlaw and by preoedaet.Viz,., thst of interpreting tl-e lAw akfetig their Own Privilege for themsgelves.

How, then, could It be said -with truth that those who -advocated the olaims of the Jewsg did not Intend to unchrisatoanie 4the eIgislature? he believed, for his own part, that if it courd be fairly explained to the country, as it might be by A well-eoncerted aietation, that these annualBills, nominally only for the admis snof Jews, were Intended to strike down the Christian charater of the Ie gs , the people would regardn with Indignation all such Insidiouaxproposals. (Hear, hear.) When the hon. misembor for Ftasury recommended the Hous to seat laron RiothsoiUcl-thtt profitable object of compasion-by way of resolution, he could tell him that the position whic -Lios client would then occupy would be stil more miserable than that of a shuttoock between two battledoree, No sooner would Barn Rothschild have taken his seat than he would finid himself involvedI in the courts of law, bandied 3bout between two sets of lawyers, with the certain result of being subjected to a fine of 5001. for every thne he venitured to vote in that House. (Rear, her.) The noble lord the member for the city, after having introducedo a B last session which doubly violated the standing order now condemned his own proeedings by asking the Rouse to resolve itself izto comaittee for the pduose of considering his proposl in Its true ses as a retlitouuquestbone Onbly last seslion the noble lordl decled over atn ever ain that his proposal to admit the Jews was but a stop in the directpon 'of tat for which he had continually voted-the open and -$Vowed destruction of the Christian character of the Legislature, (Cries of "No, no.") The statement of the noble 3ord was that he would have no restrictoionupon thenad. mission of Jews to v el offices, that he would no longer e a security-mogner but that his object in future wol be to deprive the Iature of its Christian cearxterwoslo Lord J. RUSSELL said that the hon. member wa not .,quotIng correctly. Re never made such a statement as that npow attribtetnd to him. (Hear, hear.) Mr. NEp WDEGATIi could not at that meomsent refer to dffnsard, but cmording to theat authority, which he had consulted the night before, the noble lord informed the Riouse last seon that If It did not adopt his propo ta for the admisiaon of Baron Rothschild he would no longer ,meddle with the advocoay of those seurities which bharacterized his Bills of 1847 and 1849, and which he had abandoned so long ago as 1854, He thought the noble lord would not deny that statement; but, however that nay be, 'ea could not but feel thedeep impropriety of the present pro. posal. The country had felt and had acknowledged theyhand of Almighty God in the calamitous events which had taken place in India; it had humnbled itself before God, holding s acreld a day for that purpose; and, having thus acknowledged the power of the SupreLe Being, and -deprecated is anger, there had been throughout the length and breadth of the land an unanimous expression of the fervent hope that India might henoeforth be g med spon Christian principles. (itar, hear.) Whakt,then,'was the proposal now before the Rouser? It was not aproposal that India should be governed upon a principle of religious indifferentism, or that the Government of Indis should hide Its own relion and bow down before the miserable muperstions thatsurroundredoit. hut it was a proposal that the Iomperial Parliament of England itself should abandon its -%Oristlanity, should prove how little it valued thab religon In the defenae and professon of which the victims of the mautiny in India had so gloriously died, and should do that at the very moment when a heathen host was banded agAinst the Chrtean faith and making martyrs by tens of thoe. sands. (Hoa.) He spoke thevoice of the people whern he stid that thisproposal would grate upontheirfeng(Ra)Ty would say "1when we wee Christianitythsaaieinnd, .and multitudes of our countrgnen rendeigu hI ie rather than abandon their faith wearsdgutdwhte proposal that the Parlia6ment of Englnshudctofis -alleguance to God as reveaed to usthog oublse Redeemer."

We had had warnings enough. While that Hnewsdsus Ing the Bill of 1847 the revolution was beigi rne ("Ha,hear," and laughter.) The honourbemme o - Shffie.lrd seeed to rejoice at the resultoftareluin 'but he, though a Tory, regretted thatFrnehdlshr -constitutional freedom. What was the prelue of that loss? It was that the Parliament of France cost off "Chistaniy a t chraceriticproesso,Tecne *-~unosofthtstp lmbre fr10yer, t h epia revolution denied a 'woman as the goddess of zreson, and 'which fell with a csh, from wbhich the liberties of Fracee hadnotsinoe recovered, And then the honourable member "for Sheffield chuckled and laughed when he heard that great -country had by her abandonment of Christianity proved her ncapacity for self government. He did not wish to detain the Rouse (cheers), but as long as he had a seat there he could not hea a proposal mado for the destruction of its Christian character without entering his protest -gainst the proposition. There was no instance of a -country abindoning Christianity without falling, and the Protestant oonsttution of this country could not be naintaneod unless the Parliament continued Christian | Protestantism was Chrstanity purified, and he could not uneerstand how any man who valued the freedom whtch we -enjoyed, and w ho admitted, as he believed the noble lord ~did admit, that the freedom of our constitution grew out of 'the reformationk of our religion, could make such a pDroposal -s5 this The otuntr thanked God that it had a lRouse of Lords to defend it, and that year after year that eenibly -resisted the endeave of members of the House of Comunons to sacrifio. the fundamental principl Of the GoverneMent, Mr. PEASE was one of those who desired that that Rouso -should always be, as it was always intended to be, Chris- tian; but he took a view of the best means of maintaining its Chritanity different from that which appered to be -entertained by some hon. members. In the course of a former debate upon ihis subject the hon. and learned member foz Stamford reviewed in a very clear and forcible mnanner the vaous guards which the law had established to preserve the Chrisinity of Parliarnent sad of the institu. tions of thi country ; but he gave to tho3e guArds andforms I higher importance than he (Mr. Pease) could allow £iem, He held that It was the eesence of the principles of -ehristlanity which had caused the House from time to time -to establish these forms, and tbat, ,'although the forers shouold be abolished, this essence or spirit would still preserve the Christianity of the Legislature. lie was sorry to say that it puas hut little that he understood Christianity, but if he understood it at all it was a principle which had no reaon to fear the Jew. Were the Jew ten times richer and rnore learned, and had he ten times more social influence than he was alleged to pomm, the Christian ought to he able to go down to the rock ofhis belief and say eshaU outlive your principle, my Christianity abahoatlive~ the diSpesadon tha went before It" (Heale, hear) Thre wsaDime when it was said of wh%t we calld the inferior dispensation "One shall chase a thouand, and two shahx put ten thousand to flight." If we inherited any part Of tbe faith Of the martyrs who were burned ages ago we mi&ht adopt very similar language as to our religion as because he feared the admmission of Je Int P aet. He respected the Jeas his neighbour and as his friend (hear ear) as one who had an equ right with himself. to the enjoyment of hig own opinioDs, and as one wbo had worthily filled many offlces of trust, profit, and responsibility; bat at the same time be was bound humbl tomaintainhisown faitb, and to desire that it might be spread to Jews also. Ee would make one remark with regard to what had been skid of the noble lord the member for the city of London. In the British otuse of Commons it was riot necessary that so humble a voice as his should he heard on behalt of thxt noble lord, but it was due to those whom he represented that he should state that they believed the noble lord to be actuated by motives very different from those wbich had been attributed to him that evening. (Hear, hear.) If be went into the north of England he should hear it said that the noble lord had been for 10 ears, and twice 10 years, the teady and uncompromisIng friend of eligiou liberty, and that in the year 1857 it wras unnecessary to allege such mea and ordid motives as had been insinuated that evening in order to account for his pursuing the only course which, as the consistent member for the city of London, he could adopt. Mr L BUTT said that on a fornler occasion he voted against a measure silnilar to that to whichthe noble lord now asked the sanction of the House, because he believed the exclusion of the Jews from Parliament-to b esesential to the maintenance of the Christian character of the nation. He was as anxious as ever to maintain the Christian charscter of the Legislature, but he bad, upon reflection, become convinced that the admisdon of the Jews would not Interfere with that character, and he should therefore now givo his vote in support of the proposal of the noblh lord. (Cheers.) At the proper time he ahould be ready to justify these views, but let him now warn his bon, and learned friend the member for Stamford, who seemed to dmsent from hIs proposition- Sir. F. THESIGER,-I neither sdd nor did anything which could intimate either dissent or assent. Mr. BUTT.-At all events, he did so when he addressed the committee. Let him warn his hon. and learned friend that by arguing that the admision of Jews would unchris. tianize Parliament he was putting a sword Into the hands of I those who argued that its Protestantism had been deetro ed by the admission of Roman Catholics. He believed tat the Christian character of this nation rested upon something very different from a phrase in an Act of Parliament, a nbrase frorm which Rochester did not shrink, and which iibbon used as glibly as the most pious Christian. Itreted primarily upon the prevalence of Christian doctrines and Christian precepts among the mas of the people; and secondly, upon tbe result of that prevalenoo as evidenoedby these laws which were inseparably interwoven with our social constitution. So long as we followed the precepts of Christianity in our conduct towards our fellow-men we should better uphold our national character, and set a better example to other nations, than by the retention of a useless phrase, which a man who'had no Chris. tianity would use, but from the adoption of wbich a man of a sensitive conscience might shrink. Ho did not intend to trespass further on the time of the House, but he did not wish to avoid expressing his opinion, because there was to be no diviion at the present moment. and when any division should take place he would be found recording bis vote in favour of the BilL Mr. STANHOPE congratulated the hon. and learned gentleman who last spoke on the position he had assumed of being doubly right. When he voted agains the noble lord's Bill he conceived himself perfectly riht, and now, when asont to vote in favour of it, he fancied himself equally right. (HEear, hear.) He believed that, as the hon member for North Warwicksbire had intimated, they must consider the proposed measure in oonnexion with the future Govern. meDt of India, and with the question how far the support of Christianity was to be the rule there In futue. If they once laid it down that Chriatianity ws no longer to be the great rule of action here, they had no right to blame those having thenanagementof IndfA for rnot sutridentlymaintain. ing Christianity as the basis of their government, or for enooaraging, In order to preserve their dominion, the superstition of the Hindoos and the fanaticism of the Mahomedans, (Hear, hear ) The people of his country and their fellowsubjects in India would deem tht they rwere actually estblishing a system of hypocriy if they violated In this country a principle which, It was urged, should be acted on in India, even contrary to the wishes o the inhabitants. (Hear, bear.) MIr. GRTFPTHIX, who spoke from the Opposition bencheos, was unwilling to allow it to be supposed that every member on the Opposition lide of the House was opposed to the noble lord's measure, which was the culminating point of that edifice of civil and religious liberty whlih the noble lord had had the honour of raising in this country. (Hear, hear.) Those wrho uniformly opposed the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts and the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act might deem it right to resist the present measure, but he was bound by no restrictions of that ldnd. The deep debt of gratitude due to the Jewa for the preservation in their language and observances of one great bulwark of the Christian religion must not be overlooked, and for its preservation and transmission the Jewish sect had been miraculously selected, and allowed to exist till the present day. The House of Commons was a political and not a religious assembly, and it was impossible to believe that it could be unebristianlzed by the presenoe of one or members of the Jewish body, which was not characterized by intolerance, for the Jews of the present day subscribed to Christian cbarities. (Hear, hear.) If the House rejected the proposed BUI, it might as well, in conaisteny, appoint a committee to inquire snto the private religious belief of every hon. member. (Hear, hear.) Mr. WALTER did not rise for the purpose of prolong the discussion, about which It appeared to him to be difficult to say anything new; but he could not help thinking that the events which were passing around them furnlshed a s'ngular illustration of the lisne of argument adopted7by Centlemen on the other sdde of the House, What was It that excited so much alarm in the minds of those hon. members ? Why, that the Bill for admitting the Jews to Parliament woould have the effect of destroying the Christianity of the country, Why, that was the very argnment used by the Sepoys, who complained that their religion was going to be destroyed by " greased cartridges." What was a religion worth that could be destreyed by such means? But was the apprehension of the Sepoy a bit more irrational than that of2 hon. members who thouglht that Christianity could be destroyed by an Act of Parliament s It was degrading Chrstianlty to make it amenable to any such influence. He always disliked quoting Scripture in that assembly; but there was one pasage in Holy Writ wbich seemed to him to bear so remarkably upon the subject before them, that, with the permission of the House, he would draw their attention to It. He referred to that passage in which the Divine Author of our relglon Him. self depicted the character ef His kingdom. He said-" My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now Is my kingdom not from hence." Now, without meaning any disrespect, he must be allowed to say that the only functions which the House of Commons had to perform were essentially those of an earthly kingdom. (Hear, hear.) The Christianity of this country depended, not on the House ot Commons, but on the personal religion of the individual members of society (hear, hear); and they could no more destroy Christianity by an Act of Parliament admitting Jewrs or even Mahomedans-if any constitaenoy should be so mis. guided as to send one-to that House thau they uncbristlanized the country by their admission to society. (H3ear, hear.) Mr. ADAMS felt himself constrained to defend the oommittee of lst year from the attack which an hon. member (Mr. Dillwyn) had made on at least a portion of Its members. It was impousible for any committee to >y more marked attention to any question than they did and if there were ans gentlemen who did not attend duing the whole of the sittings it would hardly be said that doing so was on all occasions necessay to enable members to arrive at a sound conclusion upon a subj'ect He oould advert to gentlemen who voted in the minority who did not attend all the sittings, but it -would be ungracious to do so, and therefore be factious. He believed that the members on both sides were actuated by consdenntious motives, and it was well known that the conclusions the majority arrived at received the approbation of tbe most distinguished members of the legal profesdon. (laear, hear.) He hoped this would be argued as a great quetion, and tnot on individual and personal grounds. (Hear, hear.) It was too vast a queation to boso dealt with, and he hoped it would be constdered in a manter worthy of the House of Commons, and not in a mere vestry spirit, or that anyone ,would be influenced to i.k a partisular course because gentlemen were threatening nlterior steps, (HeAr.) He oertainly did not understand the noble lord (Lord J. Russell) to have thrown ont the threot Imputed to him. He did not undersand the noble lord to threaten them with any abstract resolution if he did not sUceed in his present object. The noble lord by no means went to the extent of sy that simply becauxe he could command a majority of that House he would use the influenoe of his high position to cary by the force of numbers a resolution that would effect his object. It would have been unworthy of the noble lord to use such a threat, and because It wa unworthy of him he knew well that the noble lord would not have recourse to it. He was not now discussing the principle of the measure. Other opportunitIes would be afforded them of dolng so, but he mnust join In the protest that had been uttered by others against the ill-timed introduction of the measure. (Hear, hear.) When It had been determined to enter upon the consideraon of other great questions, and especially of one which deeply interestd the publc mind, he did not see that there wras such urgency in tba Jewish queetion as to entitle it to urecedence over them alL. (Hear, ear.) He would rerve himself for the consideratlon of the Bill when it came before them; but in the meantime he might say that whatever step was taken he hoped it would be in strict accordance with oonstitutional usae, and that no violation of the constitution would be recommended by the noble lord vbo had evex been an eamest and eloquent sp porter of the constitution In that Hous (Hear, hear.) One hon. member recommended that they should not only proceed by resolution, but that they should go further and prevent the interference of the courta of law. (Hear.) What ! Were they who made the laws to hold forth the example of settin aside the courts of law? (Hear, hear.) Were they to declare by a resolution that because they disagreed with the judges as to the state of the law, therefore the judges were not to be permitted to Interfere ? (Hear, hear.) He begged to remind the House that they had never come wel out of any conflicts they had entered Into with the courts of law. (Hear, hear.) Let them endeAvour by all constitutional mears to alter the law, if alteration it required; but let every such alteration be made by the three %atates of the realm, by whom the law wa%o*ginally fr&med. (Hear, her.) SKnoh a course only would redound to the credit of that House and to the honour and welfare of the country. (Elear, hear.) Mr. DILLWYN explained tbat he bad only referred to the conduct of the mxjority of the committee because the bon. and learned member for Stamford had previous1y re. Eerved the proceedings of the minority. Lord J. RUSSELL-No gentleman is more entitled to speak In regard to the conduct of the committee than the Ion. and learned gentleman who has just sat down, because the hon. and learned gentleman made in it a speech of great ability, which I think had a considerable effect on the decision at which they arrived (hear, hear); but when he states that the decision of the majority was supported by the most eminent members of the profession I mtst say that there is no one either in the majority of the committee or out of it more entitled 'to respect as a member of the pro. fession than the Attorney-General (Hear, bear.) I hold lian to be one of the highest authorities whose opinion could be taken on this subject. (Hear, hear.) The hon. and )earned gentleman says I should not have introduced this measure so early In the session. Now, ir I had interfered with the Indemnity Bill, or with the Committee on Com' mnercial Dlstress and the Bank Act, there would have been some reason for what he had said; but, as no business of very great urgency had been put down for this day, I do not think it can be said that I have Interfered with the public' business. (Hear,) It mnst be recollected that the city of London elected an member of the Jewish persuasion to represent them in 1847, and that the question has never yet been finally deoided, and there. fore, I think, the subject is one on which a Bill ought to be Introduced at as early a period as peeoisbl of the session. (iEear.) But, though I have brought forward the question in this short session, I quite admit the propriety of putting off the ecoud reading of the Bill till we meet again. The hon. and learned gentleman sa,s this House has suffered in its conDicts with the courts of law. That may be so with reard to some questions of privilege ; but with regard to the decisions of courts of law the country might have- beenstill paying ship money and we might have been still under tha power of the Crown if this Hous had rested satisfied with those decisions. (Hear, bear.) An ob'ervatUon has been made dnring this debate more personal than wag necesary, and not over civil, by the hon. rcember for West Norfolk (Mr. Bentinck). He said that I was, no doubt, acting under the influence of a great capitalist-by whicb, no doubt, he meant Baron Rothschildupon this question. That hon. member appears not to know the history of this question, and he has evidently not observed that long before the year 1847, whenever this subject was introduced into this House by Sir Robert Grant and othen, I always supported the claims of the Jews (cheers) and that whenever the Jews asked to be admitted to a fell enjoyment of the privileges of the constitution I have always given my vote in their favour. The hon. gentleman also omitted. to notice that at the t election, so far from any part being taken by Baron Rothschild In ry favour; he joined with three others, that the votes of the electors were asked for those four ; andthatasfarasBaronltothschildwa conoernedlshonldnot at this moment be a member for the city of London. (Hear.) However, the people stood by me (cheers), and I am grateful neither to Baron Rothschild nor to the princely mer. chants of the city. But I am under obligations to the people-to the great body of the citizens of Londonwho supported me when they thought with me that I was unfairly attacked. The hon. ventleman's personal observa. tions have, therefore, not much foundation, and his knowledge of the history of this question is evidently very inaccurate. (A laugh.) The hon. gentleman the member for North W arwicksbire (Mr. Newdegate) says that I intend that Christianity shall no longer be acknowledged in this House as tho basis of the constitution, and that I wish to destroy the Christianity of this House. As regards the form of this Bil I might again quote the wordsof Mr. Canning, and say, I am not blwa a bound to find a security for your faith." I hbave always contended that the Christianity of this House would not be destroyed by admtting the Jews to this Houe, but that you would gve a more striking proof of Christianity by breaking down these barriers than by maintaining them as they stand. I always put this question to hon. ;entlemen who ado=t the argument of the hon. member- Do you aoknlowlege this to be a Christian nation? Tbere are 48,000 Jews in it, and if the existence of those 40 000 Jews prevents the existence of a Christian nation then you ate not a Christian nation. But if, although you have 40,000 Jews in this country, It is stil l Christlananstion, then I ask why the admission of one or two Jews Into Parliament would not still leave this a Christian ParliaI ment ?I (Cheers.) To that question no answer has been given or can be given. (Hear, hear.) I have always contended tbat the Christianity of this Honse is not dependent upon the oath that Bolingbroke and (ibboa have taken, but that it depends unon the personal sentiments of the members of this HEonse. (Hear, hear.) It is no doubt to be wished that they should be uiRded by Christian sentiments, but the Christianmty of this eountry is not dependent tbereon. Having said this much I do not wish to carry the discussion futher; but I will aid that the hot. and learned member for Boston was right in supposing that r said that in case no other constitutional mode should be left I should think It right to bring before the House for its decision the question upon whioh the Attorney-General has formed a decided opinion, and which he expressed in emphStic terms. That is a matter to be hereafter considered. The question was much debated in committee, and it is right that the House, in a matter of suoh grave importance, should come to a decision upon the sauject, if no other constitutional course should present Itself. (Cheers.) Mr. CONINGHAM, as the representative of a large constitnency, ws convinced that he expressed their opions when he declared that they took the same deep interest in the removal of Jewish disabilities whioh he himself felt. It was not for him to canvass the reasons that had Induced the Government to hand over a measure embodying a vital principle to an independent member (hear, hear, nor was it for him to raise any objections to the hands in which it was placed, but, as a member of the Liberal party, he would tell the Govornment that those who entertained liberal opinions were carefully watching its proceedings on thls Bill, espeoially as the noble lord at the hoad of the Govermoent had not made this a Cabinet question, but had allowed an influential member of the Cabinet to walk out of the other House without voting. He trusted that Parliament was notabout to see a repetition of stch a proceeding. The question was not whe'ther Baron Rothschild should be admitted, but whether a man should be excluded from a seat in that House for his religious opinions. The removal of these religious disabilities was nothing but a complement to the Reformation achieved some centuries ago, and he was certain that in spite of all re. l=tance this question must ultimately be carried to a triumphant issue. (Hear, hear.) Mr. NEWDEGATE wished to say in explanation thaithe bad never awerted that the majority of that House would cease to be Christian if Jews were admitted into the Legis. lature. It had, however, been admitted by the highest constitutional authorities that to recognize their claims c ould be to violate the Christian character of that House which had so powerfully regulated its prceeedings. Mr. BE NTIN2CK wished also to explain that the inaccurcy whichthe noble lord (J. Russell) had imputed tohim was notin his history, but ia the noble lord's memory. What he said was, that the noble lord had brought in this meare at a time and under circumstances that rendered it an irregular and, in his opinion, a factious proceeding, and that such a course, when taken by so high an authority as the noble lord, would lead one to suppose that some pressure from without must have Influenced his oonduct in so doing. Mr. STEUART thought that the House of Commons, even if it were the politioal vestry that some represented it, ought to hestate before it admitted the Jews. Give the Jew the fullest politioal and social rights, but his feelings and principles were such that he could not be a useful legislator there. The Jew had bigher views and consolations, and, a3 had been well said, he looked to a greater Exodus than that from Egypt. The hon. member for Brighton hsd declared that the country ws anxionsly watching the conduct of the Government on this subject. He believed, on the contrary, that no question had excited less interest at the last election than the admnon of Jews to Parliament. (Hear.) He did not think it quite accurate to Bay that there was any real excitement upon the question among the liberal party, except among certain members in that House, and persons who, like Baron Rothschild, were peculiarly interested in It. (Hear.) The motioa was then agreed to. The House resumed, and the rolution was reported. Mr. FITZROY moved for leave in accordance with the resolution, and the Bill was subsequently brought in and read a fint time. T1H PUBLIC HEALTH. Mr. COWPER, in moving for leave to introduce a Bill io amend the Public HeslthAct (1848), said, it was the s me Bill whiob was road a first time last seson and could not be proceeded with for want of time. Being anxious that the Bill should not be again exposed again to the same fate ha had taken the ea2liest opportunity to introduce it, aud Ise trused that the House would be prepared to oonsider it afer the Christmas recess. The general object was to provide that every town in England, great or small, should have the opportnity of acquiring, without any considerable cost or difliculqy, local zpreeentative government5 armed with sufcdent powers to provide structural works and to make regulations necessary for the saxitary Inprovement of the inhabitants. The tendency c,f manufactures ad the movement of particular branches of industry caused the rapid growth of towns in places which were previously tbinlY Inhabited. The suburbs of Birmingham, Manchester, and the estern district of London had rapidly accumulated verylargepopulations. Houseewerebuitwithont method and wit-hout under-drainago, so that the refuse was arrid into somne neighbouring ditcb, where it remained to create noXIous vapour injurions to health. It was hardly to be ex. pected that any private Individu would bave so much publio spirit as to risk the expense, in cae of fallure, of an application for a private Act, and thererore these places had Io organization at alL Many of the older town were also desdrous Of acquirng larger powers than were afforded by the Publo Health Act. Both the towns which had and the towns which had not representative government wished to be able to adopt the Public Health Aetwith greaterfacilitie3 and with provisions more adaptd to their wants. He proposed the interventiort of the general board only in cases where the boundaries had to be adiered, and where tome of the provisions of the Publio Health Act had to be modfied. 7he powers to be acquired under thls Bill would be for making structural works, borrowing money, ssPPlYing water, lighting streets, and providing regUtions wbich were necessary for the good govern3nent of these towns, There were some who asked, Why such meddling and such unnecessary interf--onoe? The purpose of the m1eddling was to get rid of tbhrefuse of thousands, whioh had the effet of substituti.-g disease for hesilth, wes.ini. .Dm %txhngthi, and deoth i, -pi, *; r Z. n-mier of deaths from preventible causes was estinates at 80,(00 a-year, a large, proportion of 'which wxoae from' dieases ltIogetinr -to be prevented if tows were properlY cleansed. It was acknowledged by the highest iniecical authorities that typhus fever was generated be overcrowdiog and by noxious exbalations; and in blind purliens, oourts, and alleys, typhus numbered among its victims about 17,000 persons. Other diseases, as erysipelas c nsumption, and scrofula, were greatly increased by the "ime causes. It was admitted that cholera was a dlisease which could be prevented being fatal by cleanliness and care. No better iustration was afforded than by the two towns of Tyne;nouih ard Newcastle. In the Interval between the last twovsitsations of cholera sanitary memures. were adopted in Tynemouth, and neglected in Newcastle. At the last visitation the deaths in Newcastle from cholera 'were 2,000, and in Tynemouth 4. Similar results 'were traeable with regard to pure water. It was found, by comparing the deaths 'which occurred among the pt'pulation of London served by the different companie, that those who drank the foul water taken from within the iidal ae died in a proportion three and a-half times as sreat as those who drank the pure water whfch was taken from above the tidal rear Cholera, with diarrhoea and dysentery, destroyed 27,000 annualy. In the same way the mortality of inauts depended greatly upon the influence of the air they breathed, and Dr. West mentioned that infantile diarrbosa, in the severe form in which It prevailed in the Ill-drained districts, was not to be found in the well-drained dIstricts of the metropolis. There v'as a tendency, continually going on in this country, to gavitate towards towns ad to live Iees in rurl districts.h The town population was snore unheilthy than the raral. It 'ws found that people died in large towns at the rate of one-third more than in small towns and villages Among many causes which increasd the unhealthiness of towns was the neglect to remove Immediately from the neighbourhood of house the refus which, if allowed to decompose, polluted the air and tainted the water.

Tlhe trducet hon ~entlerrtan oacludd by m~oving for lea to in- Mr. AYRTOIj said, the right hlon, gentleman was under a misaoprehenslon If he supposed that the opposition with wbich bis Bill of last year had been received, was to Ahe end to which it was directed. It was to the indisereet means by which it so-tght that end, and to the disposltion evinced to bring all the action of the local authorities under the control of one central office. Provided that the Bll were drawn in such a manner as to effect the end of improving the sanitary condition of the people without infringing on their personal liberties It would meet with hi support, Sir A. ELTON thanked the right lon, gentleman for the clear exposition which he had given of the objects of the Bil. From his own experience, as the head of a local board, be -was convinced that it wa eminently calculated to unrther the welfare of the people. It was a poor man'o question, for the poor man had no security against the neglect of his landlord to provide for his health and comfort but the law. Though he was a supporter of the principle of local freedom of ction, yet be thought there ought to be a power existing Eomewhere which would set right the wrongdoings of the local authorities, and stir them up 'when they neglected their dnties. (Hear, hear.) Leave was then given to brlng in the Bill, which was subiequently brought in and read a first time. SIR H. HAVELOCK'S PENSION BILL On the motionfor the second reading of this BUI, Mr. W. WILLIAMS said that, thouigh he had very frequent occasion to oppose votes of public money, in this instaoe he felt great pleasure in supporting the proposition of the Government. General Havelock, by his exploits, had covered himself with glory and conferred an inestimable service on his country, and he fully merited all the reward which the Qneen and the Leislature oould betow upon him. t Mr. BOWYER thought that Parliament was dealing very inadequately with the great services of General Havelock. (Hear, hear.) He had peformed one of the greatest exploits known in the military history of the country-he had saved an empir-and the reard proposed for that was 1o0001 for his life. What benefit wassuch a reward to his family? He was being shot at now 50 times a-day-nay, a report had been circulated within the last hour-which he hoped the Government would be able to contradlet-that he was actually killed. At any rate his life was in hourly risk. Generally these pensione were conferred for one or two lives-for the lIves of the son, or son and grandson, of the person who had performed the distinguished servioes. That was the case with regaril to lord Gough, and the service performed by that distinguished nobleman was scarcely of eater importance to our Indian empire. General Havelock had been made a baronet, but the same dignity had been conferred on a gentleman who happened to hold a high municipal offlce when the Prince -if Wales was born, and on another who gave a dinner to the Emperor of the French; so that the honorary disction which had been bestowed on General Hxvelock cwas by no means overwhelming. Parliament ought therefore to be more anxious to sme that what had been called the substantial part of his reward should be amlple. (Hear, hear.) If no other member undertook the duty he should himself move in committee that the pension be continued to the sOn of Gleneral Haveock, himself a gallant officer, whose services had procured hira the great distinction of the Virtoria Cross. (Hle r, hearg) Str C. 1APIER thought that the Government had not conferred s&ilent bonour or remuneration either on General Havelock or General Wilson. (Hear, hear.) Re wAs quite certain that Parliament would have been ready to bestow a much larger pension on General alvelock if the Government bad proposed it, (Hear, hear.) Never in the annals of the Britiah army had there been such an example of extraordinry skill and undaunted courage, The same might be said of General Wilson (hear, hear), whose assault on Delhi-a strongly fortified place, garrisoned by 15,000 or 20,000 soldiers, 'was one of the finest exploits recorded in history. He hoped that the Government would reconsider the propriety of conferring still higher rewards on the men who had saved our Indian empire. (Hear.) What was 1,0001. a-year for life to General Havelock, shut up in Lucknow, with 70,000 men outside the walls, in hourly danger,-perhaps at this very momaent killed? He would not say this was a shameful way of rewarding him, but oertainly It was not a proper wAy. The army was notsufficiently rewarded for its services-cer. tainly not that portion of It 'which served in India. is gallant relative fought two great battles and conquered a kingdom, and what was the reward he got? Her Majesty took a bit of red riband oft his neck and put it over his shoulder-that was all he got, not a fartbing of pension, General Havelock had not been properly rewarded he repeated. How had the lat batch ot peers got their honours? One was made a peer because he was father-in-law to a duke; another because he was brother to a marquis; and a third because he had written a book. (Laughter.) He believed if they polled the whole population of England the nanimous opinion would be that General Havelock ought to be made a peer, at all events. (Hear, hear.) General Keane was made a peer for his military services; but did he perform half the military services that Geneal Havelock had rendered ? So, too, was Gough. He, it was true, was Commanderin-Chlef; but Havelock excelled every man of whom he iSir C. Napier) had ever heard. "Why, bless my soul 1a laugh), General Havelock has gained more vlotories in a few 'weeks than were won in the whole Peninsular campaign; and now, with only between 2,000 and 3,000 men under his comrnand, he is menaced with 70,000," He and General Wilson had performed some of the most extraordinary marches, and that too under a troplcal sun, while thousands of men on thelr way from this country to India to reinforce them had been tossed about st seatfor weeks and monthsinasailing vessels (hear, hear), who might have been oonveyed to their destination by steamships without any unnecessary loss of time. (Hear, hear.) He would read to the House a copy of a letter which appeared in T1t eiwma of that day, and was written in Calutta on the lst of November:- "The sailing troopships Nile, Areta, Barham, Ulysses, and Surrey, are al that have yetarived of those which left England with troops In June and July "The steamers Golden Pleece, Sydney, and Australian, which left England on the 14th and 16th of August, and tho steamer Thebes, which sailed on the 31st of July, have "The Golden Fleece brought a complete regiment (Her Majesys 34th) in perfect comfort, without a sick man, in OSdae "Would it not be a well to keep up 12 or 20 such 8hips in Her Majesty's navy expressly s steam troop transports for the relief or reinforcements which may be required for the colonial, Indian, or war service of England? The advantages would be,-firstly, a whole regiment is trnsported complete it all parts and ready to act together. There have been some porhons of Her Majesty's regiments here for six weeks the other portions of whic have not arrived. Secondly, the greater speed and greater certinty would enable more correct calculations of periods of arrival and of movements dependent on them. Had the soldiers deapatched in June, July, aud August in sailing vessels been sent by steamers, ten regiments might have been here and mnarohed up on the 1st of October, instead of one so marched up then; and on this date such ten regiments might have been at Cavrnpore. Thus, instead of the hard and desultory fighting in Oude nowr going on w;ith some peril to the be. sieged garrison, the whole of our force could have been employed in such strength as to crush and destroy the enemy by a complete and overwrhelming blow. " /Hear, hear.) It would be in the recolleotion of the House that in June last both be himself and an hon. member on the opposite benche-a mzan 'who had had great experience in navigating the Indian seas-urged the necessity of employing steamvessels In preference to sailing ships in conveying the troops then about to be sent out to India. They were, ho ever, overruled; for the First Lord of the Admiralty, and he beheved the Secretary too, told the House that saling vessels would perform the voyage AS soon as steamvessels. (Hear, hear.) He (Sir C. Napier) asked, bad they done so? He had rea them a communication showing that salling vesels had not arrived in the same time, nor anythingglike it. e said that was a grievous error oz the part of the Admiralty, and it was a fit snbsct for the Hous to inquire whether the country was ruled by people -who understood their business or by thos who did not. (Cheersm) He admitted that afte-r they opened their eyes'which it took thom a precious long tln.o to do ialaugh)-tho Admiralty made the grepbest efforts. o repsir the blu4der they had committed, es. 'i alO s 11'rime tiner, the F4 eretary for War, and tbh rest of the Government H'e dia not blame the noble lord at the head of the Government for mot sending the troops aoross the Isthmus of Suez, as son,e had urged him to do, inasmuch as he could-never calculate upon what number of saUing vessels eould be got thers for conveying them on to India: It was stated the other night eleewhere that one reason why the trocps ewere not sent out to India in men.of-war WAs that officers in the navy had a great disinclination for snoh a service. That feeling might previl ataong them to a cer. taini extent. He could underetad a captain of a msn-o1f, war disliking t carry troyps in a fllUy manned ship to Portszounth or Plymouth ; buit In .suob a crisis as this Indian rebelion he did not know a eaptain in the navy who would not have been delighted to sail to India on sucb a service. (Eear, ber.) Such a ship as the Duke of Wellington, for Instance, wouId have carrled 1,090 or 1,200 troops out with all the ease in the world. Why, then, had that not been done? It wa not the fault of tbe Government; it was the fault of the House of Commons and those gentlemen who led It. After the Crimeanwar was over the luniversal opinion of the House was, that we should keep up our army and navy, and never let them be reduced so low aganm. When Parliament met In 1857 we had a navy on the home station of 10 sail of the line, and a disposable army. But the diaols. tion of PArliament wax decided on, and thou aroe the cry of retrenchment. (Hear, hear.) And who raised that cry? First of all, the noble lord the member for the city of London; then the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, and then the right hon. gentleman tbe memnber for Bnckinghaushire. (Cheers.) It was those tbree distinguished individuawswho raised te ryof ecoomy and retrenchment, jad he (Sir C. Napier) remembered standing up in his place and dolng the beet he could to dissnade thenoble lord atthehead of theGovernmentfrombeing ledawayby it. The-nobelorddil notchooseto $a.eh advioe. He (Sir 0. Napier) snpposed, like all inister he had a certaindegree of fear that he might lose his place (A laugh.) What, then. did the House do ? Why, theT paid off the navy by wholeusle-discharging marines; amen, boys, almost everybody, in fact, connected with the service right and left. In somethbig like 48 hours any one of the menrof.war on the home station could have been prepared to si with 1,200 troops; and let the House conceive what wrotld have been the effect in Calcutta of the- arrival there of a squadron of 10 or 12 sail of the linke, ecad coniveying 1,000 or 3,200 seldiers. (Hear, hear.) He did not mean tosay that Cawnpore might have been saved; hut what would have bees the resnat In the garrison at Lucknow, the Tery next news from which might be-but God forbid that it should be so-that our whole army there had been destroyed and the women and children butchered? Before, however, so horrible a tredy should be committed with innocent women and children as was enacted at Ca wuore he trusted General Havelock would placethem onhis magazine and blowthewhole of themnp No English general ever would permit women, atil less hus own oountrywromen and their children, to be so ontraged if he himself had the means of terminating their lives at once (HeaLr, hear.) The general in command there would take the whole reeponsiblity of. such a lst reso rcupon himself, fearff gas it might be, and would figlgt to the last moment, as would every soldier under hit oommand, rather than that a single woman or child should be touohed by such infernal villains. (Cheers, and a laugh.) The lst news from Lucknow was thaI the garrison were short of provsions, and that they were obliged to kill their own gun-bullock& What of that ? Rather than that the people about him should starve for want of food, if he were General Havelock he would kill every Hindoo that came in his way and eat him. (Great laughter.) Hon. members might lagb; he spoke his own sentiments. (A iugL) A bit of a Rndoo would certainly not be a very agreeable meal (a laugh)- but he would destroy every one of them rather than alow a single hair of the head of any woman or child to be touched by such inhumanruffians. Hetrusted, however, they would soon have better news from Lucknow than the last, and tbAt Almighty Providenoe, which had done so much for us already in this crisi, And a great deal more than we had done for ourselves, would protect our unfortunate country. men and,women, and that General Havelock would still be able to hold his own. (Hear, hear.) Mr. P. OBRIEN said, as this was au oocasion when the House was called upon to pa a tribute of respect and admiration to a distingunished individual, he rose merely u a represntative from a particular portion of the empir In order that the people of Irelnd might be understood as Joining in the general feeling of admiratioA of the gallantry displayed by the heroic man who was the xubject of ths dlscussion. (Hear, bea.) He would wiluingly support the proposition to prolong the grant if such a motion were oonsistent with the rules of theHouse, whloh, however, he wAa told wsz not the case. But it was not by any money test that the value of servies of such a man could be ascertained, and the expressed feelings of the House and the country could not fail to be l4ghly gratifying to him who w;as the object of such praise. At the same time, without seeking to detract from the greatness of the service performed by Sir H. Havelock he might observe that there were not only other generals, but also soldlers in a humbler sphere, who also hbd a right to the consideration of the House and of the country. He wa induced to make that remark from the recollection of one now no more, who had been his contemporay and friend-the gallant Nicholson (hear, hear); a man who by his great mind and powerfulenergy had been enabled to enlist in our cause the Sikh nation, and had thereby been our slvation in Indla. To him was due the suppresion of the Seaeloto mutiny, and by him, in conjunction with Sir H. Lawrence, the Punjab was preserved to us. The widowed mother of that gallaUn offioer was now residing In a northern town of Ireland, having previously lost a son in the Affghan war, while a third sonhd lost his arm in the attack upon DelhL He (Mr. O'Brien) would be wanting in his duty If, at a time when those honours were being paid which -were valued by high-spirited men more than mere money, he had not come forard as an Irish gentleman to state facts which would insure to that poor lady in her affliction the consoling thought that her gallant son's services had elicited the enthusiastic approbation of an assewbly of English gentlemen. (Hear, bear.) HIe thought honour was due to all brave men-generals, sabalterns- down to Private Scully, who, at the hard of his life, fired the train which blew up the ates of Delhi. (Hear.) Sir H. VERNEY reminded the House that they were discussing a particular subject, but he thought the short debate which had taken place would not be without itsb dvantage, as it would convince the Government that If they thought fit to advise Her Majesty to confer any higherhonours that House would be prepared to support them. i(Eear, hear.) He would submit that theconduct of our armyin itho eld and the movementSrf bodies of troops required higher qualtfications than the mere command of an army besieging a fortress, and if that were so, were not the services of General Haveloclc entitled to special recognttion and reward ? (Hear, hear.) That gallant offioer vras now between 60 and 70 years of age, and this proposition was but a small reward. (Hear, hear.) The Governmeat were prudent in dealing with suoh a matter in a cautious spirit, but now that the feelings of that House, the representatives of the people, had been so strongly expressed, he hoped the noble lord, who was always inclined to generosity, would consider the matter onoe more. Mr. CLAY hoped this was only an instalment of reward fcz the services of a great man. (Hear, hear.) He, however, rose because the gallant admiral had stated that a peerage had been conferred upon an eminent man simply for wring a book. The hon. and gallant member should re. collect that there were other modes of rendering good services than by fighttng, and he (hMr. Clay) was certain the Queen rarely conferred an honour which had met with such unusual concurrenoe as when Macaulay ws made a peer. (Rear, hear.) Captain SCOTT spoke s a friend of the Havelock family, and one who had served for 20 years in the same regiment vwith the late Colonel W. Hvelock. That officer, who might be known to some as the "fair haired boy,' was he who saved a division of the Duke of Wellington's armT,, and for that service he was rewarded with a lientenantwcoonelcy in the 14th Light Dragoons, and finally lost his life at lamnuggur. He (Captain Scott) had addresead the House because the Havelock family might have considered it extraordinary If he had not expresoed his disap. poiutment and disatisfacHon with this life annuity to be granted to Sir H. Havelock. He must express his disappointment at the inadequate reward to be bestowed upon that gallant officer, The family of the Havelocks was not a wealthy family. The late Colonel W. Havelock had nothing but his pay to depend upon, and he believed Sir H. Havelock had nothing more,having for many years remained a subaltern, which he would not have done had he been possessed of means to enable him to purchasehi s steps. Upon his death the value of his oommnission would be lost, as in the case of his brother, and his family would lose the benefit of the annuity now proposed to endure only during the lifetime of Sir H. Havelock. Hlis son, a young man in the army, wras probably dependent upon his pay, and at the death of his father he would find himself hampered w;ith a title with nothing but his pay to support it, IJnder these circumstances be thought tt very hard that the annuity should not pass for two lives. (Hear, hear.) Sir F. SMITH, as a military man, 8hould be sorry to give a sile nt vote upon this in teresting q nestlon. In common with his brother officers he looked upon the conduct of Sir H. Havelock as aa honour to the British nation, and as forming one of the highest pages in our history. (Rear, bear.) He was sure that the Government, in reo7gnition of such gallant services, seeing the sense of the oose and the feeling of the public would be inclined to deal in a liberal spirit as regarded money matters with Sir H. Havelock. If he should be spared, as God grant be might be, he had no doubt that further hoours would be in store for General Havelock; for he w satisfied that nothing could surpas the conduct of that officer and of General Wilson. (Hear, hear.) He believed that in modern times there was no record of any siege at all to be compared, eitber with respect to the difficulties to be overcome or the sucess of the operations, to the siege of Delhi It had been attacked by a force sometimes not exceeding 2,500, although it poeFessed a population of a warlike oharacter to the amount of 100.000, and actual defenders to the number of 50,000 or MM,000. We might gatber what ba been at all times the warlike cbaracter of tbe inhabitants of Delhi from the exploits of Tamerlane, who had prefaced his operations Sin t the city nearly 500 years ago bi nssacringin coTd ino 100,000 Eindcoo prsoners, and bytbe dlffi ltiesexperieneed by Nadir Shah somewhat more than three oenturies later. He certainly must say that the sucess of the recent siege appeared to him to be Aaamrelloau considering that our men were suffering from the heat of the climate from sun-stroke frnm cholera, and from hard work. (Hear, bear.) AU military men apead that there was no instance of such a siege being undertaken except by regular parallels and approaches; but Genl Wilson had adopted the bold daring, sand danagerus Imeasure of establishing batteries in the open air, as It was termod, the last battery being actualy withinL 150 yards of the plame There was nothing On recordl equal to that. (Rear bear.) He raode a breach in the wall and stormed the place wikhout those suppc.te whic al miitay me thugh tobe nGeessary.

LBECT1ON INTALLIGBNCB. V.AqlP T[7J.N The election of a member to p clythevancy in the representation of the Eastern Divin ot the county of Kent, occesioned by the resgnation of Sir B. Dering, on account of illhealth, took place yesterday at Barham-downs, near Canterhlry. The high-sheriff of the county, Mr. John Savage, having brIefly ened the proceeding, SiW. rRN&ATCHBDTLL stood forward to propose Mr. W. Deedes as a fit and proper person to repreesntthe county in Parliament. He said he wa sure that they would all concur with him In an expression of regret at the cause of the resignation of their late hon. member but, as they had lot his services,the duty devolved upon teiem of electing another gentleman to represent them, and they could not, in his opinion, return one more fitting for the office than the hon. gentleman whom he now proposed. (Cheera.) Admiral DAPH seconded the nomination. The EIIGH SH.aurP then put the usual formal quetion, -wbether any other candidate wras to be proposed, and no answer being given he declared Mr. W. Deedes duly eected a member to represent the eastern division of the county of KIent In Parliament. (Cheers) Mr. DZEDs then stood forward, and ws received with loud cheers. He said he could not forget, and he wa sre they did not do so, that only eight months ago he bhd stood before them and avowed himself the defeated candidate but, although defeated, he was not disgraced, and when he retitre he felt that there was no imputation upon his political conduct, and the Assurances to that effect that he had since received and the manner In whtch he had been returned that day showed that he was justified in entertaining this impression. (" Hear, hear," and cheers) The hon. gentleman who had proposed him had alluded to the cause of their being amembled that day, and he could assure them that he most cordially joined In the expreSsion of regret that illness had compelled that hon. gentleman to retire from the Important posttion of their representative. As the vacancy had, however, occurred, it became the duty of the electors to return another representative in the placa of the gentleman who had resigned, and he should not have come forward as a candidate but for the reception of a most flattering requisition to that effect from a considerable body of the electors, and he now appeared before them in obedienoe to that requisition. (Hear, hear,) They had done him the honour to elect him as their representative without opposition, and it was olear that the requisition could not have boen a very bad one; Indeed, his hon. friend the member for Sandwich, whose zeal for the new party with which he had connected himself they were all acquainted with, couna not ssy, at a recent meeting that had taken place in the'county, anything more against it than that it appeared to have three names appended to it which ought not to have got there, ("Hear," and 4 laugh.) Having said althat he considered necessary pon peraonal mattershe would now venture to express his oplion that the proceftdings of this day should be regarded as a proof that the opinions of the majority of the electors of EastKentwereunaltered,andthat they still as they always had been ,were in favour of the prinCiples of Conservatism (HIear.) They had returned him unpledged, exceptto the extent that he should perform his duty honestly and conscientiouly, and that he would exercisehis deliberatejudgment nponevery measure that might be introduced to the House of Cowmmons, (Hear.) lIewoujd never acet the position of arepresentative except upon those terms. He never would be a delegate, but would always exercise his ewn independentjudgment, anduon severaloccasions he had, as they were aware, supported the measures Droposed b the Government of Lord Palmerston, contrary to the feel gs of the party with whom he generally acted, nd he had done so because he believed that thoe meesures were expedient, and calculated to operate for the benefit of the country. (Hear, hear.) He ssured them that in future he should continue to pursue the same course, nd he should only look at the measures that were proposed without ay reference to the party who proposed them; and, whii deter. mined to support and preserve all the ancient institutions of the country, he should at the same time readily concur In any changes that the lncreasing wealth and inteligence of the people might render necessary to be mado in those instiutions. (Cheers.) There could be no doubt that matters of very grave inbportanco would have to be discussed during the ptresent session, and that the representatives of the poople in the House of Commons would be called upon to decide upon a great man y important questions (Hear, bear.) He wrould not detains them hy any long disquisition upon political matters on the present oocca sion, because he considered that wfas not the place to do so, particularly as he had alws freely and servedly given his opinions upon the most importnt questions before the public upon previous occaons, and he should only brlefly allude to one or two questionsthat were likely to be discussed in Parliment, and which were undoubtedly questions of the greatest importanoe. The first was the currency and the commercial crisis through which they had recently passed. Everybody, of course, must desire that the Legislature should do something that would be calculate to prevent the recur rence of such a state of things. (Hear, bear.) It appred to him, however, impossible for any law to have the effect of preventing over trading and speculation, to which the recent state of affarz was no doubt In a great mcasure to be ascribed, but they should, at all events, take care not to do anything that was calculated to encourage improper speculation, and tbhat it was a very dangerons principle to enunciate to the commercial oommunity that if they got themselves into difficulty by their own rookless proceedings the Government was ableto release them. (Hear, hear.) It occurred to him that such a course was calculated to produce the evil that had lately arisen, and he shold certainly do all in his power to oppose every measure he considered calculated to produoe this effect, and to prevent the recurrence of sunch a state of things a that which had recently existed. The state of the money-market would, he fed, be calculated to produce a grest deAlof diatress sthemanufacturing diatrits,by cadog a lrge number of workmen to be thrown out of employment, but in agrcultural districts the p wsre would happiy not be felt so severely; bnt, as it might still have the effect of indueing employers to part with laborerswhom otherwiso they would be glad tolceep,he hoped theagriculturlst would not forget that tbey had besn hlessed with a most bountiful harvest, and tbat it was tfeir duty in tbe present condition of the ouatry to do all in their power to aIleViate the distresss of those wrho were in a less favourable condition of 3ife, and t}at they would continue to give as much employment as was consistent ith their means to the labouring populateon. (Ber, her.) With regard to the question of India he shook ouly say a very few words. ]t appeared tbohim thatitwaa the duty of every member of the House ef Commaons to support the Government of the day in every measure calculated to put down the mutiny and to restore order ia that eouatry. (' Beer, hear," asA cbeers.) Bofore theeends wee efed it woald be idle to propoe w inessure fo?the goverment of that oountry in lutue, aud,be was of oplsie« tbAt tbey ogbht not to begrudge either en or money k> restore order, And plae id once me4re ox n afi and s fe footing, aud again render it ons ef the bzightest Jewels of the Crown of this empie (Cheers.) Upon the subject of 2eform all he ad to say wi that be abhoid give any measure that was proposed his most careful And deliberate eonEideratlee. It seemed they were not to be ibdalgei wit the details of the measure tat was intended to be psoposed by the Government until the House met Again; but wez tey were he should be prepared to support auy proposntio he considered calculated to reme*y any abue that existea in tbe reptesntatin of the eopie; but heahoa'd f,rib fi rpeo e every propoesitie rhichrhe no sidei dangrous to the constitution or calculated to impaix ths, e1ciexcy of the old institutions of the country.

LONDON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, The Bank Issue Indemnity Bill was read a second time. Some other business of an unimportant nature was despatched, and their lordshipa adjourned. In the House of Commons, in reply to queations by Sir J. PAEINGTON, Lord PALMERSTON gave very full explanationa respecting the passage of British troops through Egypt to India. The House having resolved itself into a Committee to consider the Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, and Abjuration, and also to consider the disabilities afecting EiR MAJESTY's Jewish subjects, Lord J. RUSSELL, in moving that the chairman be directed to move for leave to bring in a Bill to substitute one oath for the Oaths of Allegiance, Supemacy, and Abjuration, and for the relief of EER MlAJESTY'S subjects professing the Jewish religion, stated the nature of the Bill, the chief feature of which was the addition to the oath proposed in his former Bill of the words " on the true faith of a Christian," and by a subsequent clause authorizing the omission of those words when the oath was administered to one of MER MAjESTy'S Jewish subjects. He did not propose, he aaid, to alter the Roman Catholic oath. He referred to an opinion of the ATTORNEY-GmENmEu, that the Act 5th William IV. entitled that House to frame a declaration to be taken in lieu of an oath, and suggested that, although the result of an inquiry before a committee was unfavourable to this opinion the decision was arrived at by a small majority, and the question might, if necessary, be revived. Sir F. T1lESIGER observed that it had been arranged that there should be no opposition to the Introduction of the Bill, and that the aecond reading xhould be deferred until after Christmau; but he entreated Lord J. RussEM to pause and consider the consequences of a measure which would be a stepping-stone to other innovatlons, to the admisaion of Mahomedans and Hindoos. He should, he said, resist the measure in every stage, because he believed that, by the ,dseaaion of Jews to the Legislature, a fatal biorowould be given to a prlnciple interwoven with every department of the State. Mr. DrLWN and Mr. Cox supported the motion, which was opposed by Mr. BNmrTDcK and Mr. NEWDEGATE. Mr. PEAS, i supporting the motion, argued that the relaxation of forrs did not impair the Christian characer of the giiature. jHe had ;ls4ened, he said, with pain to the small amount of vital power attributed to Chrintianity, the principle of which had no occasion to fear the Jew. MIr. B13, though he had voted against the former Bill, would support the prsent measure, upon the Chrtian principle of doing to others as he would that others should do to hix. The motion was opposd by Mr. SrArOp;, and supported by M. G Br'4 Ir. WAvj regarded the argument of those who alleged that the admission ofa Jew Into that House would destroy its Chrisianity as very much aldn to the notion of the Sepoys, who thought a greased cartridge would destroy their teligion. The Divine AuTuon of our faith said, "1My.kingdom is not of this world." The Christianity of the country depended upon the personal religion of the people, and the presence of Jews in the Legislature would no more destroy its Christianity than the country wUs unchristianized by the presence of Jews in it. After a few remarks by Mr. An.Sx, who reserved his opinions upon the meaaure; a brldf reply by ILord J. RUssELT, and some further diseusion, in which Mr. CONnINGRTA and Mr. S=AAT took part, the motion was agreed to, the resolution wa reported, and the Bill was ordered to be brought In. Mr. COwPxR, in moving for leave to bring in a Bill to amend the Public Health Act, explained its nature and objects, and entered into various details relative to the sanitary administration of towns. A few observations were made by Mr. AmTOx and Sir A. ELTox, and leave was given to Introduce the BLl Sir HEnsBY HAVEOCk's Annuity Bill was resd a second time, after a discunsion, in which the title of the galant officer to a higher reward was strongly urged. The House adjourned at half-past o'c1ocl
There are political mea3ures carried by enthusiasm-there are others that win their way by the force of conviction and the strength of principle. So, if there be a party inclined to sneer at the removal of Jewish Disabilities on the ground that the annual Bill is a farce, that the country is tired of the question, and that it is only a hobby of one or two leading Whig politicians, the supporters of the measure can only bear the taunts, and reiterate their former arguments. To suppose that Lord JoHwRussunn could in the eleventh year of the discussion bring forward anything new is of course out of the question. Yesterday in a Committee of the whole House he introduced once again the clims of HER MAiSTY's Jewish subjects, and a Bill was ordered to be brought in to remove their present disabilities. By many devices and in many forms have the friends of emancipation proposed the measure, so as, if possible, to obviate the objections of the opposite party. Last year it was determined to unite the abolition of an absurd oath with the removal of the words obnoxious to the Jews, and a Bill passed the Lower House to change the Oaths of Abjuration and Supremacy into one which both Christias and Jews might equally take. This year Lord JoHN RussELL asks directly for legislation in favour of the Jews, and proposes that to the form devised by the House of Commons last year the words "Q On the true " faith of a Christian" should be added, but that when a Jew comes to be sworn those words should be omitted. The reason alleged by Lord JoEN is, that the words have obtained a sort of prescriptive value in the eyes of many, and also that Mr. DIsRABx has expressed an opinion that they should remaiu part of the oath. But, under whatever form relief is demanded, the principle is the same. The question simply is, whether men of all religions shall be admitted to take their seats if elected, or whether religious exclusion in any form shall be retained. Lord JoHN RussELL tells us, that it was on the 10th of December, 1847, that he brought forward his first Jewish Disabilities Bill, and on the 10th of December, 1857, exactly 10 years later, the persevering Statesmau again appears with the same demands. The sum of the arguments used during this long siege of the fortrem of intolerance may be given in a few words. If we go back to first principles, we may declare that no Englishman ought to be excluded from a seat in Parliament on account of his religious convictions. This is but the logical conclusion of aU the legislation of the last 30 years. We admit Unitarians and Romanists, Quakers and Swedenborgians ; we must even admit the members of the sensual fraternity of Mormons, Bince these sects are willing to utter the words " On the true faith of " a Christian." It therefore follows that practically there is no obstacle to men of every variety of religious opinion taking their seats in the Legislature. In fact, it has become a commonplace of platform oratory, that no man in this country shou!d suffer disabilities on account of his opinions. It is proclaimed that in this reapect we have adopted the principles of religious equality in their widest sense. Now, how is religious equality understood in other free, or at any rate civilized, countries ? In the United States, in France, in all our own colonies, including the prosperous communities of Canada and Australia, the Jew takes his seat, if elected, as readily as the Episcopalian, the Roman Catholic, or the Mlethodist. It is certainly of little force to resort to speculation, and ask what would be the consequences of admnitting Jews to the Legislature, when we see those consequences exemplified in some 50 communities of our own race, religion, and language. Is Canada a Christian country ? Is the Legislature of Victoria a Christian Legislature ? If to, in the name of modesty and common sense, let the cry about unchristianizing England and the English Parliament cease. Then, the arguments drawn from the evident intention of the Legislature in framing the Abjuration athseem to us unanswerable. In the days when that oath was imposed it was certainly thought out of the question that a Jew shoulId be elected to a seat in Parliament. The Jews had been only two generations before admitted to reside in England; they were a totally foreign race, speakincr mostly Dutch and Italian, and were as much divided from the people of the country as Gipsies or Lascars are in the prerent day. But, if the law did not contemplate the possibBility of Jews taking their seats, it as little contemplated the introduction of Quakers or Unitarians; and, as t) the wilder sects of the present time, we may be sure that if it had ever been thought that persons holding doctrines that differed so much from the o-thodox standard would be elected a test would have been introduced to exclude them. 5, that if the Legislature intended to exclude Jews the whole spirit of the Act has evaporated, and they ought to be admitted on the same footing as other non-orthodox sects; and if the Act was merely directed against the PRETENDER!'Sadherents, and the Jewish dificulty is accidental, then, in common fairness, the words ought to be removed. This seems to have been really the case. There can be no doubt that all which our forefathers desired was to ecure a Legislature and an official body firm in their allegiance to the Protestant succession. The words " On the true faith of a " Christian" are well known to have been used to bind more stringently the consciences of Catholics, and the penalties denounced against those who should refuse to Bwear point only to this conclusion. Under certain circumstances the person who would not talce the oath was to be considered as a Popish recusant. It was never supposed that any but a Jacobite or a Papist would refuse to swear. Then, again, it is plain that the case of the Jewa never occurred to the Legislature, or else it would have remembered that a nonChristlan might have Jacobite leanings, and that it might be necessary to to adapt the oath that it might be administered to Jew as well as Christian. Indeed, in whatever light we look Iat the matter, this exclusion of a certaiu class of Englishmen by a form of words which has no relation to them seems totally indefensible. But we are ware that this reasoning will have little effect on the opponents of the memure, simply becaus they have long given up the defence of their position by argument. The old cry about unchristlanizing the Legislature will be repeated again and again, as if the Legislature could be more unchristianized by the admission of Jews than the country is by their sojourn in it; and as if the Christianity of the country was anything more than the Christianity of the people-of the individual units who make up the English nation. We can only appeal to the good sense of all classes to bring this wearisome question to an end. It must be remembered that until the HIouse of Lords choose to yield to the reiterated wishes of the Commons one or more seats in the Lower House must always be kept vacant. There is nothing to prevent 50 Jews being returned to Parliament and being members of the Legislature without the power to legislate. Do the Conservatives expect that the City of London, that the liberal party, will ever give up the struggle ? Is such an acquiescence in religious exclusion to be hoped for by the stanchest partisans of immobility? If not, there seems no course for them but to yield to what is clearly inevitable. It is trlie that on this question there is no excitement. The Jews are not powerful, like the Catholics or the Dissenters, and the Tories can safely reject their claims for years together. But the Conservative leaders must feel that the measure will be carried sooner or later, and we are sure that they will satisfy the country, and perhaps a great part of their own followers, by no longer offering a wearisome opposition.
The question " What is constitutional?"V has some analogy to the question "What is providential T' The clarsical poet argued that navigation was a defiance of PROVIDENCE, because the sea was designed to separate one country from another. But the answer to that is, that if the sea is a providential separation, navigation is a providential remedy for it. And so now some excellent people argue against taking morphia in surgical operations, on the ground that bodily pain is an infliction of PROVIDmCEC; the answer to which is, that the same PRovIDExcE which sends the pain sends the morphia. In fact, this argument about PROVIDmCE, and this answer to it, run through almost the whole of life and nature. Twenty years ago thousand of worthY persons thought railways impious. What business had we to think of travelling so quickly? Was it not a proud aim at ubiquity-an approach to assuming an attribute of omnipotence ? And before the time of railways old-fashioned people looked ominous on the subject of the " Rockingham"' and the "Highflyer." Ten miles an hour was contrary to PROVIDENCE when men had been accustomed to go six. All the great creations of art have thus been voted in their Way defiances of PROVIDENCE-shlps, railways, cities-for " GOD made the country, and man " made the towu,'-as if the discovery was not in any case just as providential as the original difficulty which it cured or diminished, as if a wheelbarrow could be providential if a locomotive was not, and as if a ferryboat could be safe from the charge of impiety if the Great Eastern was open to it. The eame kind of argument goes on on the question of what is or is not constitutional. Thus, in the debate on Wednesday on the subject of Sir HE-NRY HAvELocx's pension, it was argued by Mr. GLADSTON-x that the " interposition " of members of the House" in the case of granting rewards to public servants was unconstitutional, because the constitution made the CROWN the fountain of honour. But the answer to this is, that if the constitution gives this privilege to the CRow-N. the constitution also subjects the exertion of the privilege in any case to a vote of the House of Commons; and that men have a clear right to make remarks and suggestions on an Act to which they are called on to be parties, and to which their concurrence is necessary. Mr. GLADSTONE cautioned the House against meddling with the Royal Bounty, and so marring its grace, and interfering with its character as a free spontaneous act. Thi,s argument would have had something in it if the CRowN, according to the working constitution of this country, acted quite independently in these matters, and without the slightest reference to Parliament. But this is not the case. The CROwN gives rewards upon the recomnendation of Ministers, and the Ministers represent the opinion of Parliament. That is the working constitution of this country. We do not say that it is so described in any written statute, or that you can give index authority for all this ; but, whether it is or is not " DE LoL.Nr's Constitution," it is the de facto constitution of England now. The CROWN does not act independently, even in its executive character, but in concert with Parliament, and the Royal bounty is an act of the nation, and not an act of tbe QUEEN alone. It expresses the gratitude of Parliament and the country for particular services, and therefore it is nonsense to say that the freedom and grace of this act are interfered with when Parliament takes part in the bestowal of it and offers suggestions upon it. So far as it is the act of Parliament, so far it can be interfered with by the deliberations of Parliament. This sort of Parliamentary prose is like a great deal of the advice which we meet with in didactic works, in letters from fathers to sons, in fictitious speeches of sages to your,g men, and in books about education and the management of families. With good and sensible hints every now and then, the great mass of the teaching of such books is, however well meant, extremely useless, simply because it is artificial, technical, and arbitrary. They lay down fixed rules on subjects which do not in the least admit of them, and make statute letter the guide in mnatters on which the only true guide is common sense and good feeling acting for the best according to the occasion. Nothing is easier than laying down rules, prescribing limitations, interposing vetoes, and drawing imnperious distinctions. The only difficulty is to get them confirmed and ratified by common sense, acknowleclged and received among men of independent judgment. There wasLordGRnEy, the other night in the Hou-e of Lords, laying down the law very strongly against all criticism whatever upon a Governor-Genural of Inidia in times of disturbance, on the grouad that suell critici.m might weaken his authority in India, and interfere with the effectiveness ox g- vernment. But does Lord GBEY seriouly think that everybody in this country is bound to keep solemn silence about every act of Lord CANiNNG's until this whole mutiny is over and tranquillity is completely established? fI this duty imposed by conscience or by Lord Gz There is a reason indeed given for it,-a man muist be very badly off if he has not some reason or other to give,-but if we are to accept such a reason as this for such a prohibition we must really accept so many reasons for so many prohibitions that the country and Parliament might as well at once abdicate their privilege of speech altogether. There is a possibility of some harm resulting from such criticism. But we should like to know what exertionx of what human function or talent in social or political life is not accompanied by such a possibility. All freedom has risks attending it. Everything does harm,-Parliament, the press, public meetings, elections; the only question is whether the good does not overbalance the harm. The air we breathe has deadly elements in it, and roast beef may be a fatal poison, but the general effect of both is more profitable than noxious to life. We cannot have all the advantages of a freedom and all the advantages of a despotism too. A despotism can do what Lord GREY wants, and prevent all the riak which accompanies the exercise of speech, by suppreming that faculty; but for our own part we think that the remedy is worse than the evil, and that the systeem which allows us to criticize a Governor-General of India is ultimately better for the government of India than a system which ties up the tongue of a nation. These rules, that people are not to open their mouths under this, that, and the other position of affairs, would soon give us a Count DE MoRw-'s Parliament; there would be always some reason or other why persons were not to.speak. In the imagination of many there is a crisis always at hand, if there is not one actually present; if it is present we must not speak till it is over; if it is approaching we shall only bring it nearer by speaking. These rules, in short, are a sort of respectable recognized fudge, to which a man gives vent when he finds himself in a didactic humour, or in a critical humour, or, possibly, in not a very good humour-when a digestion slightly out of order is appeased by the agreeable stimulus of coercion, by the satisfaction involved in cautions and checks to his neighbour, telling him he must behave himself better and must act according to this rule and that. How many a solemn reprimand bas proceeded from this latent cause,-how many a grave reproof, backed by the most oracular expression? Fortunately, nobody attends to these rules, nobody cares about them, nobody thinks himself in the slightest degree bound by them, and the adviser himself least of all, who, after they have answered the purpose of a temporary set down to somebody, breaks them quite coolly the next day. With all deference to Mr. GLADSTONE, then, we must give our opinion that the House had a perfect right to express itself as it has continued to do on the subject of General HAvXoci's pension. Such remarks were quite constitutional, and the occasion called for them. General fAvELocK is now between 60 and 70, and his life is exposed to all the risks of a sanguinary war in a trying climate. To annex the pension, then, to his life only may be to give him nothing. All precedent is in favour of a continuance to the son, andc certainly auch distinguished services ought not to be made an exception to the rule.
At a moment like the present, when the efficiency of every division of our Indian Army is watched with such painful interest, and when the general conditions of military service in the East are likely to acquire such extraordinary importance, our readers will derive no little satisfaction from a cer tain docuiment which we publish this morning. The position, liabilities, and opportunities of the British soldier in India, and especially on a march, are there set forth on the best professional authority, and the conclusions resulting from actual experience having been embodied in a brief code of plain maxims have been placed, by Sir COMIT OA1PBEIes orders, in the hands of every officer and non-commissioned officer throughout the European portion of the Army. It is surprising what an economy of life is promised, and what an amount of apprehension may be dispelled, by this little summary of practical advice. "With ordinaTy precaution and attention to "the common laws of hygiene Europeans may live "as long and preserve their health as well in India "as in Britain." This simple doctrine, proclaimed upon competent authority and affirmed not merely as a speculative theory by philosophers at a distance, but as a notorious truth by medical officers on the spot, ought to carry consolation and assurance to many anxious minds. There is, in fact, nothing prejudicial in the rays of the sun either in India or elsewhere. Excepting where the exigencies of military service may occasion excesaive exposure there is little to be feared from mere heat of climate. It has been the error of Europeans to consider the atmosphere as everything and personal management as nothing, whereas with sensible precautions, and a judicious adjustment of habits to climate, the heat of Hindostan might be endured and encountered with as much impunity as any of the other extremes of weather against which an Englishman holds himself proof. Hot countries require not only a dress, but a diet and an economy, of their own. The native, who can outmarch our best troops and face a sun from which our hardiest soldiers would shrink-, enjoys his immunities by virtue of his regimen as well as of his race. His head is protected by the voluminous folds of a white cotton turban, his unencumbered neck permits the fiee circulation of blood, he lives mainly upon wheaten cakes and rice, drinls no spirits, and bathes often. The European in India adapts himself, probably, to Eastern skies as regards some assimilation of apparel, but with this external testirnony to the occasion his concessions cease. He still looks to beef and runi for his meals, indulges in fruit without discrimination, and manages himself in other matters much as he would at home. Frequently, indeed, any change of habit is made for the worse. The aspect of a new country, and the influence of a new climiate, invested, in the minds of many, with certain formidable attributes, suggest a recourse to some extraordinary measures, and these meazures are often exactly the reverse of what they should be. Stimulants appear a natural remedy for lassitude and enervation ; they are taken in unusual quantities, and habits which would be prejudicial anywhere become rapidly fatal under an Eastern sun. Exhaustion of this character is, no doubt, one of the ordinary effects of the climate. Asiatics feel it as well as Europeans; only, iastead of taking spirits, they take repose. All this while, the min stands chprged with the mischief which is due to mistakes of personal economy alone, and the evil is aggravated by apprehensions without ground. Air and exercise are just as necessary to health in India as in England, though they should be taken with greater precautions. If out-door work were but shunned a little less, aud in-door work a little more, the bargain woould be improved at both ends. If the blood is k.pt free from inflammation and exe tenieiit by diet and treatment adapted to the climate, the sun, even of Hindostan, may be braved in moderation without much danger. One of Colonel JA(:OB's recommendations to Indian officers was that they should not be afraid of the sunshine, which would do little harm except to a frama disqualified for enduring it by injudicious living. Even the night air is not so perilous as 1I fancied. Sir COLIS maxims contain a regula-. tion which few medical authorities will be found to condemn. "At night," says the rule, " unless the weather is very cold, two of the "tide walls of every tent should be removed. "Protection from rain and dew is all that is "required. More harm is caused by the respira"tion of contaminated, close, and irapure air than is ever brought about by exposure to the night "wind." Climate, in short, only operates deleteriously when it is permitted to act upon constitutions disorganized by unsuitable habits. EngL;shmen in the Arctic Regions are as hearty as Esquimaux, because they attire and manage themselves in much the *ame man5jner. With corresponding precautions in India they would be as well off as Hindoos. It is something worse than folly to imagine that the attributes of the Anglo-Saxon race are to be preserved only by the usages of Anglo-Saxons perpetuated in every climate of the world. Stimulants. befit not the English blood, but the English atmosphere. Living, as we do, in a country where an impenetrable fog of yesterday may be followed by a brilliant ain of to day aud a piereing fros6 of to-morrow, and where gloom and damp have a tolerably quiet reign for about four months of the year, we Can take a moderate amount of stimulant without raising our frames, after all, above the temperate level, but when we forsake our insular mists we may leave our insular customs behind as well. An Englishman carries with him to the last all the qualities of his race inherently secured to him. He need be under no fear of losing them for lack of liquor. If the case were one of colonization, it is possible enough, certainly, that after three or four generations even the sturdiness of Anglo-Saxons might not be proof against the influence of climate operating without intermission upon father and son, but such influences are utterly imperceptible during the brief period taken for military service out of a single life. All that an officer or a soldier need do is to see that his natural powers are not impaired by the sikness which ill-considered habits are likely to induce. It may perhaps have occurred to some readers that all these recommendations about diet and selfmanagement are more easily enjoined than observed, and that the appliances desirable for health may not be 7ery readily obtained in all parts of a country like India. The regulations before us, however, convey incidentally the most remarkable assurances on this head, and it really appears as if Indiawas, in these respects, as good a country for campaigning as a soldier need look for. We are not speaking here of imported comforts, but of the supplies commonly attainable on any line of march. Water, We are told, " can. "generally be procured from some stream or "tank; if these are not convenient the wells will "always furnish abundance." Elour can be obtained " from every village, and, with it, no " European detachment need ever be without the "staff of life." Rice also-an article of food especially suited to the climate.can "be had " anywhere ;" fishh, in the vicinity of large streams, such as irrigate Hindostan, "can usually be had " in abundance," and " inquiry will prove that in "the neighbourhood of nearly every halting-place " there are fields of carrots, turnips, onions, and of " many native vegetables." Certainly, with such materials as these in aid of the Commissariat rations, marching in India cannot, under ordinary circumstances, be attended with much privation. M;any persons, no doubt, and those, perhaps, especially who have had some miltary experience, may be disposed to think little of the practical efficacy of such regulations as those we have been considering. The recklessness of our countrymen is unfortunately so notorious, and the difficulty of controlling them in their own interests so great, that in many a camp all these wise precautions may be published in vain. It is certainly probable that some soldiers will continue to do and' suffer as others have done before them-to indulge in ardent spirits, to expose themselves without protection to the sun, to neglect proper ablutions, and to persist in improper diet. We cannot, of course, expect that the notions of 30,000 men are to be changed in an instant by the publication of a sanitary circular. We do, however, believe that the measure in question will be productive of no small benefit, and it reflects high credit on the Commander-in-Chief that he should have inaugurated his operations by a proceeding so judiciously devised. Such reforms must have a beginning in some quarter or other, and, if regimental officers do but take up the matter, more good may be done than veteran campaigners might expect. Of late years, both soldiers and sailors have shov-n themselves very amenable to advice, and have learnt that frugality aud temperance are pleasant as well as profitable virtues. A move in thie right direction is generaly productive, even at first. The recommendations, for instance, of our own Board of Health have certainly not yet made all our dwellings what they ought to be, but, as a matter of fact, they have been followed by a most distinct improvement in the general health of the population. We should anticipate from Sir COLN CA&DLxL]r's suggestions much the same kind of results-not, indeed, al instantaneous discontinuance of prejudicial habits throughout the army, bat the introduction of a better system, a gradual attraction of men's minds towards its advantages, and, as the certain consequence, a steady improvement of the efficiency and position of the soldier.

TilE LE' VIATHAN. Since the efforts to move this vessel were brought ito an abrupt clowe by the fog of Tuesday, the whole rof the hydraulic machines employed have been moved up close to the ship's cradles, to as to exert their force through a very short interval and save the loss of power occasioned by their being at a distance from the ship. Early yesterday morning they were all set to work again, and, after a considerable delay and after their pressure had been exerted to the very utmost, a short slip of 14 inches aft and 13 inches forward was effected, but beyond this trifling distance it was found impossible to move the ship. in the subsequent efforts which were made the mooring tackle which hauls the rtern towards,the river, andwhich (with similar tackle at the stem) is now mainly depended on for heepinog her in motion when once the rams have started her, gave way without breaking, and the anchors which held it began to " come home." This defection of so important a part of the apparalus was final, and after a short consultation Mi. 1runel determined to give up further efforts tiU to-morrow (Saturday) morning, or until such time as a firm, unyielding holdfaLst can be obtained for the moorings in the river. Since the Launch war first begun these river moorings have been an insurmountable impediment to anything like rapid progress At the commenceinent they were not in great request, but now their services are absolutely essential, and, of course, when iust most wanted their break-down becomes most difficult to meet. The reasons which render them of such importance now is that the Leviathan has hithert-) been moving on an incline of one foot in ten, but fronm the present and until she reaches the water the "ways" over which she baa to travel only slule at an inclination of one in twelve. For the future, tberefore, it will require a greater force to start her, and a greater strain to keep her in motion for five or six feet at a time. It is only by hauling on the river moorinbs that a continuous strain of this kind can be exerted, for the hydraulic pressure of coiure ceases the instant the vessel yields an inch. For this purpose anchors of all sorts and sizes have been laid down right across the river to hold the moorilugs from which the strain is exerted. As each of these in turn proved ineffective, others were resorted to, until last week a large anchor of Trotinan's patent was laid down to secure the moorings at the stem, and another at the stern. The former still holds, though in such unfavourable ground as to make it doubtful whether it will bear the required strain, but the ground where the latter 'was cast is such a peculiar kind of dense concrete that a pickaxe scarcely makes any impression on it, and all attempts even to drive piles into it have failed. Intu this gravelly mass even Trotman's anchor has been unable to penetrawe mnore than a foot or so, and it has been at last decided to give up eitber faith or hope in anchors altogether, and drive piles-for the stem tackle inthe wharf of Messrs. Humphrys at the other side of the river, and for the stern in the loose gravelly soil on "he river's bank, near the Watergate Ferry, at Deptford. With the strain which these piles will enabjle the tackle to put on the Leviathan it is confidently hoped that at every start she will be kept in motion for tive or six feet at a time. Should this prove so, of course this most lingering of all launches will soon be over. We must, bowever, own we are not sanguine as to such immediate results, and smuch fear that now that the vessel is on a slighter incline its rate of progress will be even slower than heretofore. The total distance it has already accomplished iB 104 feet 6 inches forward and 9G feet 1 inch aft. To-morrow will be the earliest date at which operations can be resumed.
MOR.Y-MABRKTand CITYINTELLIGDNCB. Thursday Eve lg, The English funds opened this morning at a fractional improvement, and subsequently experienced a further advance of three-eighths percent. Consols for the opening, which left off yesterday at 91k ex dividend, were first quoted 911 to i, whence, under the influence of several purchases, they steadily went to 91j to g. In the Stock-Exchange the supply of money was abundant at 5 per cent. for short loans and 8 per cent. until the dividends, and this, with the large amounts of bullion flowing into the Bank and the prospect that the xazette return of to-morrow evening will exhibit a great recovery, constituted the chief causes of confidence. Bank Stock left off at 217 to 219; Reduced and New Three per Cents., 91i to A; India Bonds, 355. to 25s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 2x discount to Is. premium. At the Bank to-day there was a rather increased demand. In the discount-market the beat paper is negotiated at about 9i. The only change in foreign stocks has been an advance of I per cent. in Turkish. BusinessLhas been limited, the few transactions officially marked being in Brazilian Five per Cents., at 98; Mexican, ISc; Portuguese, 44 and 43i; Turkish Six per Cents., 92g; for the account, 92 and 92i ; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 991 and 100. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. for money, and 66f. 1io. for the end of the month, showing an advance of an eighth. The gold taken to the Bank to-day amounted to 160,0001. About half was Australian; a considerable portion of the remainder was Russiau. This is the time for great practical authorities to speak out. The question before Parliament and the world is whether a person who makes a contract to exchange one article for another at a eertain date should be held bound to fulfil it; or whether, if he has promised an ounce of gold for four tons of coal or any other commodity, he should be permitted to substitute something else if he finds that gold has become scarce and the bargain inconvenient. According to old-fashioned notions each man's intuitive perceptions would have been supposed the best authority on such a point; but the " interests of trade," the " expanding requirements of the commercial classes," the " springs of industry," and the "necessity of upholding credit," are phrases that have thrown all simple ideas so completely out of sight that nothing but everlasting discussion and an abundant use of all those great names that are supposed to embody the lights either of official or general experience can now help to show us where we are. "I have the high authority of a former Governor of the Bank," says one. "I make such and such a statement on the authority of an eminent partner in a discount firm," says another, and so on through ex-Chancellors of the Exchequer down to some unnamed but " highly influential" business man in a provincial town, who may have happened that morning, in advising the consignment of a bale of goods, to have added a postscript expressing his ideas of the functions of currency in general. If people are to bow to autho. rity, the advocates of the BankCharterAct had better retire. Tne balance in that respect has been against them for some time. They sustained a heavy blow last week when an experienced merchant at Glasgow, whose credit is so high that he has been allowed to overdraw his account with the Western Bank by 60,0001., testified to the prevalent want of bank accommodation. But yesterday evening there was a final discouragement. Mr. George Hudson,the member for Sunderland, pronounced against them. "Fevw men," he reminded the House, perhaps - needleesy, " have had more experience of money matters than I have." He remembered the former panic and the difficulty then encountered in obtaining advances, and that on that occasion, when he wished to get a loan on 100,0001. Exchequer-bills, he had absolutely been told that if he wanted to realize the amount he had better submit to a heavy loss and sell them. Since then he has " thought a great deal on the subject." Ten years have passed, and in the interval he has ripened a suggestion which he bestows upon Parliament and the country. It is, "that power should be given to the Bank of England to issue notes upon bills under discount to the extent of one-third their value." "Surely," he added, "bankers' bills and the bils of first-clam3 mercantile houses are worth 6s. 8d. in the pound." That, perhaps, depends upon circumstances. Messrs. De Volf and Co., Pattison and Co., Macdonalds, and a variety of others were all distin guished firms a little while ago. But it would be a pity by smaU cavil2 to interrupt the reception of a scheme so grand in its simplicity. All that is wanted is that its author should explain what he means by saying that the " power" to carry it out should be granted to the Bank. Already they have the power not only to advance 6s. 8d. but 20s. in the pound on aU bills they may think proper to take, the only limits to its exercise being such as may be interposed by their being fastidious as to quality. To do any good, therefore, it is evident tho system must be made compulsory. Either it must be understood that all traders carrying on business of a certain magnitude shaU have the 6s. Sd. per pound furnished on whatever paper they may present, or some Board must be constituted free from the illiberal prejudices of that institution to decide upon each application. In the formation of such a Board there could be no difficulty, and Mr. Hudson might confer on the country the benefit of his vast experience in everything relating to matters of accommodation and account by consenting to act as chairman. " The Government," he observed last evening, "had been blamed in some quarters for not standiDg by the law. But what Government would have dared to stand stil and let the people starve to carry out a principle ?" Would they fear that under the vigilant care of Mr. Hudson anything would be allowed to be sacrificed for such an object? Large engagements continue to be entered into for sending silver to Hamburg, but the delay in the preparation of the ingots or bars has hitherto retarded shipments. About 25,0001. out of the 305,0001. of gold by the Tamar will be sent to the Contlnent; the whole of the remainder is expected to go to the Bank. The following relates to an important decision in the Court of Common Pleas on the subject of crossed checks. The law is that any check crossed with the words "and Company" shall be payable only to or through some banker. A customer of the London Joint-Stock Bank sent a check drawn upon that establishment and crossed in that manner to a correspondent by post. It was stolen, and the check was presented and paid by the Bank, the words "and Company" having been dexterously obliterated. The drawer held the Bank responsible. If they had paid the check after any other part of it had been tampered with they would have been liable for the onsequences, and he naturally ecusidered that the rule applied in this case. The Bank resisted. He brought an action, and a verdict, yesterday, was given against him. The decision was avowedly based on one of those subtleties peculiar to legal rather than commercial minds. The Lord Chief Justice had some perplexity on the point. "icIi, doubt was wbether the crossing had not become a part of the check, so that an alteration in the crossing would amount to a forgery. Ea, considered, however, that, aftex all, the morn- conrect view was that the crossing is an addition anly, As it iaclUed in the statute, and a irqction tcih.ba-iker, and not an integral part of the check, and that al; alteration in the crossing would not amolnt to a forgery." Of course it is not for the public to question the interpretation thus given. They can simply take warning from it in their future transaction. TJnles3 in the hurry of commercial business and the daily interchange of hundreds of thouands of pounds merchants and others are prepared to resolve nice distinctions as to whether a certain writing is an addition to or part of the body of a document, and to recognize that the writing ijs good for something in the one case, and for nothing in the other, they had better not trust to any such contrivances. Let them assume, henceforth, that the crossing of a check gives no positive protection wbatever. It used to be looked upon as one of the greatest safeguards of business, but it was deprived of much of its value a year or two back by a decision that there should be no specific validity in a crossing with the name of an individual banker, and that the only security afforded should consist in the necessity that a crossed check should be paid through somw banker. The alight utility then supposed to have been left is now ahown to have been illusory. It is such as will be latughed at by any adept with a penknife or chymicals, and can therefore. have little effect, except to beget a false confidence in the mindc of those who may have failed to notice the circumstances bywhich it has been rendered of no account. A meeting of creditors of Messrs. Sanderson, Sandeman, and Co., blUbrokers, whose suspension was announced on the 1]th nlt., was held this after- noon, when the accounts previouily published were. read and taken into consideration. MIr. Turquand, the accountant, stated that out of 5,298,9971., the total liabilities when the firm stopped payment, 2,013,6901. had since run off; of this sum the biUs returned amount to 91,0981., of which about 49,0001. will ultimately be paid in full, and, valuing the remainder at 10s. in thepound, there results a charge against the estate of about 20,0001. upon upwards of two millions o' liabilities. A similar calculation for the remaining three millions of bills not yet due gi,ves a further loss of 30,0001., although the latter are of a better character, making 50,0001. in all. Aessrs. Sanderson's assets are being paidinto the Bank of England for the benefit of thelr creditors, and a auna has already been collected of 19,0001., and partly invested in Exchequer-bills. The capital at the time of the failure was 83,8201., to which it had accumulated, by non-withdrawals of profits, from 34,0001. Mr. Rees, the solicitor to the firm, proposed that the estate be worund up under inspection. A creditor observed that this was the only course open; the Court of Bankruptcy was out of the question, and a deed of asaignment was equally objectionable, being in itself an act of bankruptcy, and requiring the consent of every individu*l creditor, however small his claim might be. After a short discussion as to the wording of the resolutions, in the course of which it was stated that the winding up would possibly lsst over a year, the proposition was agreed to, and tbree creditors were appointed a committee of inspection. iSNo doubt was expreased as ta the ultimate payment of all claims in full. At a meeting to-day of creditors of Messrs.

Considerable discussion took place upon the large amount sunk in the sugar refinery at Mayaguez and the debt due from Decastro, Lindegren, and Co. It is proposed to continue the refinery for a short time, with the view of effecting a sale of it, if possible, and enabling stock to be realized to the best advantage. The interests of creditors will be protected by sending out the necessary deeds and instructions to Porto Rico, and it -was ultimatelv resolved to wind up the estate under inspection. In the course of the proceedings it was stated that Messrs. Decastro, Lmdagren, and Co. have authorized the payment of a composition of 10s. in the pound in three instalments to the holders of their draughts. A meeting has also been held of creditors of Messrs. J. H. Baird and Co., a firm engaged in the Australian trade. The statement of affairs, prepared by Mr. C. F. Kemp, the accountant, gives the amount of liabilities as 21,2581., the assets being estimated at 21,0831., subject to the doubtful realization of propertyin Australia. The immediate cause of the suspension wtas stated to bethe discontinuance of remittances from Messrs. Wbarton and Co., of Melbotirne, with whom Messrs. Baird had been connected in business. It was finally resolved that Mr. Baird should proce ed to Australia to make the best arrangements in his power, and Mr. Kemp was instructed to act in his absence. The dollars brought by the Mexican packet have been sold to-day at 60;d., and the bar silver at 62ld. per ounce, being an advance of {d. on each description beyond the rates obtained for the preceding packet. At the beginning of last week the price of bar silver had receded to 611d., when the state of affairs in Hambuirg gave rise to a sudden demand from that place, which, coupled with the orders for the next Indian mail, has caused a rapid advance to the prices now given. - The Essex has arrived from Australia with 105,255 ounces of gold, valued at 421,0201. The North British Daily Mail states that a branch of the National Bank of Scotland is to be opened at Ayr to-day on the premises of the Western Bank.

T?B BRAMBALL MUBDER. I - CHESTER, THURSDAY. DEC. 1O. *Xhe foUowing evidence was given yesterday after my I parcel was depttched- Mi. Walke' ex minatlon continued.-On the following da.y I received a note from the prisoner, ask-ing me to meet him at the house of his sister, Mrs. Frome, in Holme. I went at 7o'lockl, and remained till L Issw the pri3oner and 3Mi. Frome. Ptisoner took out an account-book. He said he wished to show me that he had paid out a great deal of money for that old rascal, who was deeply indebted to him. We both examined the book, and prisoner pointed out the various sums which he said he had paid for his father. I said to hirA that I understood quite differently, that sums were charged against the father that cugght thot to be charged. I also told him that I had een his father, and that the vlolence used upon him had been great, Aud that it was not a proper way for a son to use his father. ' told him that the old man had told me that he (the prisoner) had done such to him, And that I was told he was the only one who cansed the disturbance in his father's house. I advised him not to go out to his father's house, but take a lodging in Manchester, for I was afraid that if he persevered in going out there and being the cause of such broils murder might ensue. He spoke of his father frequently as the old villain, rascal, &c. With iegard to being the cause of the disturbance, he said hia father was the cause of it himself. 'He aho said that he and his brother Thomas wwredetermined totake the.managementdf thefarmn from the father. Itwa gtdlahould go toBrahdaLeuthe next Sunday to tryto ake pes, but I ws,prevented by aiothvr engagement. On the day of the murder the pri. soner called upon me, and I sw' him' about 1. o'clo6k. I had heard of the murder. He came in with a young mn named Mathieson. They both sat dowrn. I said,-" This 5s s ad circumstance that has -taken place. How did it occur 1" The prisoner answered,-" On Monday last my father had a sale of cattle, and when I came out of town I was told that the anctioneer had said there were some susoiclous characters aboat the house. When I heard that I irent in and loaded my double-barrelled gun, and put it into the corner of my beWfoom, ready to meet any robber th6t.might come that night, but none came. Next morning I observed a few birds on a tree In the gardeia; I took out my gun and had a shy at them and brought down one. Next mornnig, about 2 o'clock, I heard a ' fistling' of noise Upon the landing. I took out my gun, and by the dark light of the window I saw a man six foot high standing. I put my guan to my shoulder artd let drive at him. It struck him about here (pointing to his neck on the right side). le gave a jump and a loud screech. I saw two men pass byme and go downstairs; they had mnufied feet. I called out 'Thomas, there are robberp ia the house.' Tom came out and said, 'What is it ' I said,. 'There are robbers in the house; here are three.' My brotber Thomas then said, ' There are more of them; I have seen more.' I said, "What did you do then?" He said, " We went downstairs into the kitchen and then into the sitting-room, where I saw my writing desk broken up, and 141. lOs. of my money taken out of it. We then went into the cellar and found that the villains had been there, as they had left the ale cask running. I then went up to my own bedroom and to the old an'es room, and I shall never forget the longest day I live the sight I saw this morning." In reply to a question whether his father was shot by a pistol or a gan, he sad by a gun, and aLso that his tather had not a momeat to spAk. I drew nearer to the prisoner, and pointing my finger atbhim, Isaid, "Nowr, l.r, Henderson, rest assuredupon it that the murderer of your father will be found out. If man cannot find him, God wilL" I mentioned the cases of Manning, Rush, and Palmer, and said, " Such horrid murderers cannot escape." He was then sitting with his hat between his knees, and he seemed much agitated, He made no reply, but after a few more words he went away. Between March last and the time of the murder I frequently saw the deceased. I thought bim of sound mind, and quite capable of managing his business. Cross-examined.-The young man, Mlatthieson, lives at Manchester, but I bave not seen him here as a witness. I think before March last I had only once spoken to prisoner with reference to his father's affairs. I have never said that I oould hang the yonDg man. I never advised him to send Thomas to market with tho old man to count the money, as he was too blind to see It, Prisoner told mp that his father had given away a sovereign in a mistake for a shilling. I do not recollect seeing a man named Turubull at the farm in March. John Cooke, land agent of Colonel Davenport.-The late Mr. Henderson was his tenant. I know the prisoner, and recoltect receiving a letter from him about October, 1856. It consequence of it I met him at his father's house. Prisoner said he wished to have a little private conversation with me during his father's absence in Scotland. He began by saying that what he was going to say was a hard thing for a son to say against a father, but his fither's temper was so bad that he could not do with it any longer, and he wished to know if It could not be arranged that he and his brother should have the management instead of the father. I said I thought he could not, as the father was the tenant, and unless Colonel Davenport was agreeable there was an end of the matter. He said he thought it could be arranged by speaking to Colonel Davenport about It. He said that his motber and sisters were agreeable to such an arrangement, and that he did not think hls father was fit to manage the farm, and that'he had had a lawsuit in Scotland whish had almost r.bined the family. He spoke of his father's eyeslght being bad, and that he had on more than one occasion paid a sovereign instead of a shilling. He said, *'I do not know whether you are aware that I found the greater portlon of the money forzmy father to come on the farm."' By the lease the rent was to be increased in four years, and prisoner said that his father had freqinuty declared that he sh6uTd not be able to pay theadditonal rent, butif he and his brother got the management ho would see that the additional rent should be punctnally paid. I have frequently had convertions with the old man; he was qnite sand,and understood business as a farmer. I was attesting witness to that lease. Thomas Smitk, of the firm of Smith and Saunders, cornfactors, Manchester, said,-Prisoner was in my employ as cashier. On the 30th of Septamber he called at my pnvate honse in the morning, and said that robbers had been in the house and his father was shot or killed. He said that the first thing he heard was the sound ot shot in his father's room; that he jumped up and fired at the figure of a tall man on the stairs. I said, " Do you think you hit him 1" " Oh, yes," he answered, " for he gave a loud soream, and immediately afterwards two or three men ran out of my' fatheresroom by me downstairs." I said, Why did you not give them the other barrel ?" He said he had only one barrel loaded. I afterwards drove hun down, as he was a little lame, to the police-office. The prisoner debited himself in the cashbook on the 26th of September with 211., the balance of hJs salry ; he took tbatsum; Idid nosgive ittohim; itwasduetohim. Edward Jonme, agent to the Central Loan Asssociatlon, said-The late Mr. Henderson made an application to me for a loan of 2001., in Mtay, 185. 1 advanced it to him. We made further advances, altogether amounting to 1,0001. He paid 9001. off. I saw him last on the 24th of September. He was vigorous in his mind. After some other witnesses had been examined the case for the prosecution was closed. Mr. Serjeant PARRY then addressed the jury for tho defence in a long and very able speech, which concluded that day's proceedings. THuRSDAY. His Lordship took his seat at 10 o'clock this morning, and the trial of Henderson was resumed. Bis LoRDSHIP, commenced his summing np by saying that the prisoner stood charged with the wilful murder of James Bienderson on the 30th of September last, and the charge was the more awful as the murdered person was the prisoner's father. The first question that would arise for their consideration was one which he did not think was attended with any difficultynamely, whether the deceased .was murdered by any one, or whether he died by his own hands. But, referzing to bis habits of life, his age, and the position in which he was lying when found dead, the evidence was such as seemed clearly to lead to the conclnsion that the wound was not inflicted by himself. The next question vas, by vhom was the wound inflicted? Was it by the prisoner at the bar? The leArned counsel had properly vaarned them, that was the only question to which their attention was to be directed. But though that was the question for their consideration. other matters were involved in the inquiry, because if they were satisfied that an attempt bad been made to molest the family, and that there were robbers in the house, It would go a long way to enable them to form a proper conclusion. Uis Lordship then proceeded to give a minute description of the house and premises, alluding to the fact that there was paved ground between the house and the road, so tbat footsteps might not be traced. In regard to thvrarionsstatments respectingthetransaction itself made by the prisoner, his Lordship observed that those statements tallied pretty well one with the other, with the exceptsoa of the' staement le made to Mr. Walker. He did sot say that the statements were true, for that was a matter for further in. quir,. lMr. Walker was called and added some circungtances. to the* statement which had noS been not-iced b the. other prersons, but an addition was not a centradiction. There was one point ia Mslr. Walkere statement Oat did omittlled ols lt th te staieynents. MIr. W41ker. omitted one circumstance spoken co by the other witnePeS,: thatthe prisoner said he heard a shot tired bafore 1e himueIE fred on the stairs; bnt different questions.-wose put by diffErent person,s, and this might account I5r thervariauce in the statements, 'His Lordship then re&.* tbe evidence f the witnesses to whon the prisozer bhai nmade staements and left it for the Jury to say 'whetber they thoughisthq prisoner had in sibstance vren a connected and con' sistert account throughout; and., without throwing azy discredit on Mr. )4lker's evidence, whether I it would not be safe to ad-,v,t. tke vraaion of the other witnesses. The imnportant pZi was whetler tht pieces whica bad been picked up in a."eased's roorm were identified as cart of No. 77 of The atSggc Oist, part of which number bad been found in the prhsoner's roon. He pointed out that itwas provinglittle t ,sbohw thatw' atwasfound nearthepekrtree -as part of tha t ikumber, because the prisoner was said t have fired a shot in that directlon, and might have used 'part, fi the number for wadding. It yroved not)- ino -by Itself to show that the piece found in the po*. vas part of that number, nor was it anything to |' -ove thai the single piece found on the stairs was Part Of Ao. T7, becauso the prisoner did not deny thst he wll, r iun upon the stairs, aud that gun mi~ht have been wi'hc iarged with wadding taken from the inside of No. 77, i ,ut leading to any demonstration of guillt against the ,. jner. The great question rwas, whether thev were sat ,sied that tbe piece of paper found In the de- Jseed's room camne out of No. 77, because if they were s9tis- ted of that point, then a very differeDt conclusion arose His Losd.hip b,.ying then read and comm,,ented upon the teatirrony of the other witnesses, said it was not enough tbat the evidence left in thrir minds a suspicion, or even a grave SUSg2Cion, that she prisoner was guilty, bhut i oughi to lead to. this conclusion, that, viewing it aa reaso'able men, it was rationally consistent with the prisonues guilt only. 3nb, txking ;1l the circ=tances into oculderMtiC, snd gtving the prisoner all the benefit of the statements that had been made in his favonr, though made by members of his family, it as only froma oonvictlor t.hat they ought to hring ina *verdict of guilty. The sumuming up laeted three The jury retired At 1 o'cloco, and returned at 3. Immediately on coming into court a deep silence prevailed, and the prisoner on being called up into the dock cast looks of great anxiety at the jury. After calling over the names, The Clerk of the Court pid,-How ayyou, gentlemen,' Is the prisoner at the bar gult or not guiilty The Foreman.-NOT GuYLTY. The verdict was received in court with loud applause and clapping of hands, which continued till stopped by the offloers.
THE HEALTH OF BUROPEAN SOLDIBRS IN INDIA.* The folowing auggeBtions, which have been ap. proved by his Excellency Sir Colin Campbell, the! Commander-in-OhiefS are made for the use of officers who have had no Indian experience:- On a campaign the mortality caused by sckness Is some. times more than double, or even treble, that caused by the *weapons of the enemy. Disease may so plyze an army that the best efforts of a General are thwarted and rendered abortive. An originally large force dwindles away to a mere shadow without constant reinforcements. This happens in all countries, but perhaps to a greater extent in India than elsewhere. When men ar, disease.stricken they come under the hands of the surgeon, and it.ia then. his duty to treat theme, and apply wlat remedies are required; but before they ane. thus struck down everything depends upon the commanding-officer. " Prevention is much better than cure," is an old and most true a-dom, and one which every man in India ought always to bear r mind. In nine caes out of tan sickness may be traced to inaprudence- -imprndence ariting from recklessness, frdia want of thought, or fom ignorance. Kno'wledge on the part of those in authorlty may do much to hinder the imprudeiceof those under their po0wer ; and it is the object of theee memoranda to point oct common thlng, easy to remember and eay to enforce, which will have a marked influence in preventing the stealthy approaches of the worst of foes. Trifles constitute the sum of human life; thousands of human lives have been lost bythe neglect of trifles. Let officers carry out the trifling directions in the following few pages, and they will quickly see their good effeot. The instructions are very brief, and are purposely put into terse and stringent language, to make themmore impressive They treat only of those fev points with which every officer if he does his duty, must become acquainted. Mf AiRCNG. When practicable, the best time for marching is undoubt. edly in the early morning. The march should be fiished by two hours after sunriee. The pernicious custom of serving out a dram on the line of march sows the seeds of disease and should be avoided; but, as it is injurious to undergo fatigue after a night's rest upon an empty stomach, food of some kind should be given to soldiers either before starting or at the first halt-tea, coffee, chocolate, or milk, with bread, biscuits,. or chapdtis. In warm weather every precaution should be adopted to enable the European to stand fatigue, and to prevent heat. ing of the blood. The neck should be bare, to allow of the free return of blood from the head. A flannel roller round the belly and loins is sll the woollen material required. All other superfluous articles of clothing should be dispensed with. In cold weather a flannel shlrt, cloth coat, &o, should be worn, In accordanco with tbo temperature, Every soldier should be strongly impremsed with the danger of exposing the head, uncovered, to the direct rays of the sun. A light, cool, and comfortable cap, which at the same time allows of evaporation from the surface ofthe head and shades the eyes, temples, and back of the neck, should he provided. The men should be instracted never to throw this offi under any circumstances; and they should be told, on the first symptoms of giddiness, flushing of the face, fulness of blood in the head, or dimness of vision, to pour cold water over the head, and to keep it wet (with the cap on) forsome hours. Strict adherence to these instruotions would pre. vent the large majority of cases of coup de solei. lNo soldier sbould be allowed to remain in wet clothes longer than can be avoided. While in exercise no dznger results; but, from lying down in damp clothes, fever, dysentery, or disease of the liver inevitably ensue. When in tents, the candis- on the shady side should be thrown down, and the air be allowed to circulate freely. At night, unless the weather Is very cold, the kandta on two sides of every tent should be removed'. Protection from dew and ain is all that is required. moreharm is caused by the respiration of cointaniinated, close, id impure air than is ever brought about by exposure to the night wind. Dry straw, grass, karbi, or any of the stalks used in thatching, make excellent bedding, when covered with blankets. BA urxG. The urgent necessity of keeping the pores of the skin open in a hot climate is only recognized by officers in reference to themselves; Its paramount importance is not fimpressed upon the men. soldiers should bemade to bathe at least three times a week in cold wLter. *This operation should always be performed upon an empty stomnach, and the morning before breakfast is the best time. It is not safe to bathe when the body is much heated, if at the same time it is fatigued. Hence, on the march, the evening, about four hours after dinner, would be an appro. priate time. The skin should be thoroughly dried and rubbed. Water can generally be procured from some stream or tank; If these are not convenient, the wells will always furnish abundanoe. If every so!dier were provided with a metal vessel, with a long slender cord attached to it, for getting wvater up froml wells, he would be independent of the services of a MWL' At present no European can get water, either for dinking or washing, without the aid of a bhiwti FOOD. Experlence proves that the same amount of animal food is not requiredin a hot climate to preserve heath andstrength asin acoldono. A largc amount of animal food, instead of giving strength, heats the blood, rendersthe systemfeverish, and consequently weakens the whole body. The Rijpfits of Rfljpiit.da, and the Sik-ba of the Punjab, are physicaUy as stror,g as Europeans, and they are capa'sle of enduring more fatigue, and withstanding better the vicidsitndes of the climate Of India. This Is due, partly to race, but chiefly to the nature of their faod, of which. the staple is wheaten floar, made into chepitis. They eat but twnce a day; and, although they partake of animal food, tbey do so in very much less proportion than is the habit in Eurepe. The best food for a soldier is that which the country freely produces, and which is nutritious and digestible, and, at the same time palatable. The large quantity of porkindulged in by soldiers isnmost injurious. Pigs are foulfeeders; and any one. marzhing one day in the rear of aa Eoropean reginent, may ses the pigs, destined to feed the men, acting the paxt of scavengers, and dearing off every imaginable kind of filth. The owners and drivers of pigs are the lowest class of natives, who purposely drive their animals over groand where they mr-find *herewith to fil tfhemselves. It can radily be understood that meot thus fed nest be unwholesomeI and that by indulging in it the bloud. becomes graduaLfy poisoned, and rendered prone to recsive auy disease. Hermetically sealed, preserved, or salted provi5ias are noxious, if partaken of for a proloeg*4 period, or to, the exolnsion of fresh iood. Bread when tolerably well made is, of course, ase of the best articles of diet. Biscuits are nat so digesflbl but they have the advantage of being eeily carxied, and-of being always ready. In tVe- absenee of these, floar- ((ta) can rlways be precured, and shapdtii (a thin unlestieaed cake', are easily mde, are highly nutritious, and ana perfectly digestible when eaten fresh and bot.

THE 52dZ REGIMENI. The following letter describez one of the achievements of this celebrated corps, which is still adding to the laurels gained in every battlefield of Europe fresh renown in India:- "Camp before Delhi, Aug. 2(, 1857. "You will probably have heavd of our encounter with the 46th Native Infantry and a wing of the 9th iUght Cavalry. They mutinied at Soalkote, sacked the place, murdering several personm, male and female. We 'there' lo0t all our property, private as well as mess-In faet, everything. When we marched from Sealkote we were ordered to move as light as possible, and the bulk of our property vas placed In a building'assigned by theBrigadier, and under a guard of the 46th Native Infantry (P. fair case for compensation, you 'will ay),but when these fellows rvutinied we were at Umritslr, and upon hearieg which, and that everything had gone, we started to cut them off. We left rmritsir at half-past 8 p.m., and reached Goorduepore, 42 miles, at 4 next day. There we heard of our friends, some 1.5 alnes off, on the other side of the Ravee river, the ford over which. was 10 iles from Goordespore. They cros&ed this ford early the next morning, and we marched at 10 to meets them. They had heard of our approach, and we found them drawn up In line, both raulns kneeling, and the cavalry threatening both our flanks. Onr numbers were only aboat; 280 of the 52d, about 120 newly-raised Sikhs, and nine guns; they had aboat 800 infantry and 300 cavalry. On our drawing up In line about 250 yards from them they opened 'a fusillade, and in about five minutes we had about 40 casualties in the force. However, the moment we beganto return the complhment with grape andc Enfield rifles they made preparations for a bolt. Several oF their cavalry camse right in among us, cutting down some of our gunners, and wounding a few of mine. They were, however, speedily disposed of, when up come on our left Blank their right subdivision in skirmishing order, and so desperate were the fellows that they were aU killed- withir 15 yards of our line. The left subdivision behaved equally well, and wore all kIlled in covering the retreal of their main body. A good many of tbem w ere drowned in their hurry to recross the river; many threw away theirarms and clothes, and bolted into the villages ; but were all brought in the next day and shot. About 200 of them go' upon an island, where they had a large gun. I crossed about a mile below them two days after at d:light, and!destroyed them alL They fought their gun to the lastmoment, but their shooting was not good. Sevetr of them were kiled at the gun ; one of them in the act of- rmaming anotber dose of grape. Orotes's company havl the houour of taking the gun. Altogether, what with tbo long march and the utter destruction of the two regiments k-believe weare entitled to some credit-; miles to Goodespore, 10 miles next day, and after our fight 10 miles back to our camp,-6M miles in 4-S-hours,is wonderful work, when the heat-of the sun is considered. My casualties in the tvo fights only amounted to one offloer wounded, six men killed, and 1S wo7nded. Thls' example being considered an extingusber to the-mutiny in tho Pmnjab we were ordered towi. here (Delhi7 And arrivedon the 13th inst., having marchod W7(0 miles in tire hottest season of the year. I forgot to mnentton tha on the day of' the first fight about 20 of my men were strucz down by the son, but only threo of them died. W'e have new marched in lesthafonuryears upwardsof &,000-niles,-unparallelea, I believe, In thia or ay other army In the wcild, and still the discipline is, I am truly glad to say, as pre eminent as, ever."

FOREIGN INTELLICENNE. FRANCE. (YROM OUR OWN CORRBSPONDYM.) [The following Appeared in our second edition of yes I PFAR, WEDKLSDAY, DsO. 9 6 P.M. The Poles residing in Pari a few days back cele. brated, as usual, the annlversary of their last insur. retion in 1830, first by attending mam in the Church of the Assumption, where a sermon wa3 prewhed by the Abbe Jelowicki, anda collectioa made for the f und of the charitable society presided over by the Princess Czartoryska, and afterwards by assembling at the Polish Librarr, where the Polish Literary and Historical Society held a public meeting, in which Prince Czartorysdi once more pronounced one of those speeches which, for 27 years, he hasa on similar occasions addresed to his fellow-countrymen. The Prince, among other things, said- ' As for the ever-renewed offers of the Poles to lend their assistanoe to a cause which they oonddered as that of their country, they were always rejected by the commanderx of the armies in the East. However, one cheering reme. brance remains to us from that painful period. At the moment when the siege of Sebastopol ws alreay iar ad vaneed, one of the Aliaed Powers, that one which hbs always bn most generons to us, that one whose noble hosptAlty enables us thbs day to pour ouat our eart to each other-France, I rnan-t last declared that, In order to continue the scrifices required by tho war, it had beoome neoessary to asign to It in future an object more worthy of such great effort, and that the re-establishment of Poland must Inevitably follow. Enbglnd, who for four centurie had always taken part with Russia againsi Poland, had at last determined to form and use agalst Russda a distinct Polish corps; nevertheless, she considered the proposl of Franc prema. te. However, the rumour of this proposal transpired, and was not unoonneated with the unoxpectd empressme=sm wit which Russi-weakened, moreover, and undermined by a corrupt administration, which she Is at present making baste to reform-acoepted the proposals of peace, which were so strongly recommended to her by her two German neighbours. You see, gentlemen, that the West, and more especWly France and the Emperor, 'were inclining In our favour-the Emperor who ever extends to us his magnantmous protection. But circumstances frustrated his calculations. The peace of Paris hs restored Europe to the condition in which it was previous to the war. The ame uncertinty prevails, the ame dangers threaten; and, in con. sequence, there is the same neessity to hold armies In readiness for a struggle for which the very repose enjoyed seems but a preparation." It is said that M. Ollivier, onei of the democratic deputies for Paris, has addresed, or is about to addres, a letter to M. de Morny, as President of the 1*lative Body, protesting against the "moral violence" practised towards him in the Chamber, in not being allowed to speak on the resignation of M.Segur. The new elections to fill up the vacant seatr for the Haut-Rhin and Paris will not probably take place before March. The Courrier de Paris, which has changed its politics and become 'what it calls a " constitutional opposition" journal, contains the following article:- " Under the Empir, 'which has universal suffrge for its foundatlon, and promised liberty for Its prosetive conpletHon, dynastic parties are but regrets-they are no longer hopes; they poeas but the past-the future is not for them. On the day when this liberty shall ceas to be a prondse, to become a guarantee, what reason wil there be for the existence of those parties ? WhAt can they give ! What can they promise? Being able neither to promise nor to give anything, they wrll lose all vitality-they wlll become mere shadows. The interest of the Empire, ther fore, Is to show the same confidenoe in the promised liberty that it has done in univoersa suffrage. The same suCCOSs wil attnd the same oOnfidenoe. All that is said of the danger of the promised liberty, and about its being likely to become a weapon Inthehands of pries, wa said oontinuaUyfrom 1830 to 184I, and was repeated in 1S50 against universal suffrage. If thene pusillanimous oounses had been listened to, would not the electoral taxpaying qualification have boea re-established? If that qualification had been re-established, would not universal sffrage, inAead of being the invincible arm of the Empire agains parties, have become the most rdoubtable arm of parties against the Empire? Would not the re-eablishment of universal sufage have becomo In that case the chief article of dynastio proprammes? 'Universa suffrage is the tomb of parties, but the tomb remains open; the stone which must close it up Is liberty. They know this; and therefore It is that those who know how to look undeo their mask perceive that their great fea Is lest the promised Hberty should oome to oomplete the work of univenal suffrage-that new principle which, as the New P7Rmsian GazcU admits, is called upon to replace in the publio law of modern societies the old principle of eg. timay. Their fear is our hope. The Empire will not too long leave to dynastic parties this their lat chance, poor s It Is-this their sheet anchor. The tactics of the Legtilmist, Orleanist, and Fusionist parties ae to prek7nd that the Empire and liberty are incompatible. In what, we should like to kanow, is liberty mnore in. compatible with the dynasty of universal suffage than with the dynasty of an eleotoral qualification of 300t., or of a dynasty of an electoral qualification of 200t., without throwing in capacis t Either liberty is poesible i France or It Is Dot. If it be posible at all, It is under the Empire. If It be possible at any time, It Is at the present time, for when was power ever stronger or less die. puted than it is now? 1 And why should iberty, which is possible in England, Belgitm, and Piedmont, not be posdble bnFrance? 9s Fnce,elther in regard to civzlixatlon, sentimnents, or Ideas, behind the other three countries? Is the Emperor Napoleon m. less firmly seated In the Government supported by eight millions of suffrages than Queen Victoria, King Leopold, and Kir7g Victor Emmanuel are upon their thrones? Has he an ay less considerable or less devoted? Reas he a less vgilat police? Is he less well served by his administration.? Are French finances in a less flourishing condition than the finances of England, Belgium, or Piedmont? And, besides, what could liberty gain by turning against him? She iwould have everything to lose and nothing to galn by such a course. It has been sid that liberty would be abused to reproach the Government with December 2. But who would have a rlght to use that date sa a weapon? Would it be the incapables of February 24, 1848? Would It be the dynasy of August 9,18? Would it be the restoration of July 8, 1815? It has been also said that liberty would be abused to open the flood paes of revolution. But under that standard could a inew revolution be attempted? Would its wat-ohward be ' Progress?' But oannot all progress, proved to be such, be accomplished under the reign of the new dynasty? Is there any progress whatever which b Incompatible with It? No, the Empire has othing to fear from liberty; liberty would be Its strength n the fture, as niversal t age has been in the p W defy any one to show the contrary. This is so tirue, that the Empire might repeal all lasw of proscription, and revoke all decrees of exile, without the slIghtest risk; the day of that repel would be the dyIng day of partles,sentenced to extilnction b! universal sufrae.9' The Three per Cents closed to-day at 661. 5c. for the end of thre month, and the EFour-and-a-HaM per Oents, at 91f. lOo.; Orleans Rallway Shares, 1,283f. 75c.; Grt Northern, 897f. 60c.; Strasburg, 6501.; Paris to Lyons and the Mediterranean, 840f.; Western of France, 650.; Bordeaux and Cette, 517t .;c.; Great Central of France, 6201.; Lyons and Geneva, 615f.; Bank of Cridit MobiL:r, 711f. 25c.; Austrian Railways, 665.; Roman lways, 4751. ; Ruian Railways, 495.

Now, the artillery and i " maer" are entirely in the hands of Austa, but still her representative is unable to produce the kles of the powder magazine which was blown up on the 18th of November. It is not proved, but it is nitrally believed In Mayence, that the Auxtian utilletymnn, Wienmer, abtaced the keys of the M*tlns Tower from the room of the Austrian managing captain (ZeUgs-Hauphmann)a "who was accustomed to keep them in some exposed place, inBtead of locking them up in a drawer or chest." The concluding words of the petition of the Municipal Council of Mayence to the Bund are:-" May the hon. Diet grant a just indemniification for all the damage done to the property of the inhabitants of Mayence, and may it make known itb resolution to that effect as soon as posible (bald mdPlichit)" In order that each confession may have its proper share of the large sums sent to Mayence for the relief of the sufferers, a committee, consisting of the Roman Catholio Bishop, Protestant Superinteindent, and Jewish Rabbi, has been appointed to examine into the justice of all claims for relief that may be made. On Thursday, the 3d inst., Baden laid its convention with France, respecting a masive bridge across the Rhine at Kohl, before the Diet. The latter, as a matter of course, referred the matter to Its military committee. You will probably recolleot that the Emperor of the French some years since proved to the Germans that it was a matter of little importance whether there was or was not a bridge across the Rhine. He was at that time a suitor for the hand of the Princeua Caroline Wasa, who is at present married to the Crown Prince of SaxcUy, and to give her and the Grand Duchae Stephanie of Baden a favourable Idea of his power and gallantr, he threw a pontoon-bridge over the Rhine, and rode across it with a numerous suite. A man was tried here on the 4th init. for murdering his mistress, and during his examination the followineg facia came to light :-He had served 32 years in the army, and during that period had been guilty of theft, fraud, and robbery. He had made two atterapts to commit murder, and had deserted seven tires. During the 32 yea he had received 260 blown with a stick, had 25 timea ran the gauntlet through 300 men, and had been kept for 14 years and 7 months at hard labour with heavy irons on his legs and body. PRUSSI. (FROx OUR oWN COBBUsOND=T.) BERLIN, Dxo. 8. The continued improvement in the King's health may to a certain degree be measured by the vists he is now permitted to receive, which necessarily evidenoo a much inc ed atrength both of mind and body. IThus on Sunday last he received the visit of the Princes of Prussia, who had attended divine service at the chapel of the Ciarlottenburg Schloss, and in the evening Baron von Manteuffel, the Minister-President; this is the first instance of any political personage having been allowed to approach His Majesty aince he withdrew frm the conduct of public affairs, for hitherto, with the exception of memben of the Royal Family, only his Adjutants have been admitted to his preeence. On returning from CJharlottenburg the Princess of Prassia repaired to the ILager-Haus, where the remains of Professor Rauch lay in readiness for the funeral to be held on the following day, and deposited flowers on his coffin. At the solemn service which, according to the ritual of the Evangelical Churh in Germany, ia celebrated in the house of mourning previous to the corpe being carried to the grave, the Prince of Prusaia, the Princes Aidalbert and George of Prussia, Prince Radzivill, all the Ministers, Baron }Iumboldt,and every diatinguishedchef of the ay and civil adminition, were present, together with deputations from the municipality, with the Burgermeiers at their head, the members and Senate of the Academy of Art, and almost every artist of renown in Berlin. The centre and most capacious of the three large ateliers, in which the living sculptor had conceived and executed so many glorious works, was converted into a funereal chapel for the reception of his mortal remains; all that told of every-day work was removed, and the walls hung with black draperies adorned with silver wreaths; the coffin itself, of larchwood, rested on four silver trusses In the form of lions legs and clawa, and waa covered with flowers and votive wreaths ; the whole lit by seven candelabra, bearng a profusion of waxlights. The background of the coffin was formed by a niche of the wall, containing young palm trees and exotic plants, in the centre of which stood, on a high columan, the bust of the deceased, bearing the golden wreath that his pupiblshad presented to him on his 70th birthday; immediately at the head of the coffin were placed Rauch's statues of the Praying Youths, the genii of Love and Faith, and,slightly elevated over them in the centre, his genius of Hope, with the lotus flower in hind; and the whole was surmounted by the two fgures of Victory that the decsaed had executed 20 years ago for the Schloss at Charlottenburg. At one end of the coffin lay, on a satin cushion, the wreath of laurel that the atts of Dresden had presented for the ooasion, and at the other the Orders the sculptor had received in his lifetime. Anong them was the firstclass star of the Order of the Red Eagle, presented to him by the Mng on his 80th birthday, and the highest Order that any German sculptor or painter has ever received. It is superfluous to add that the whole arrangement, which proceeded mainly from Profemor Kiss, his favourite pupil, produced a most impressive effect on all present, the dark drapery of the spacious apartmnent throwing out into strong relief the numerous busts and statue of the great departed or the illustrious living that the artsistic hand now cold in the coffin before them had called into existence. The dim pure light of the clusters of wax tapers in the candelabra, and the wavy lines of the sprays of palm that the two Victories seemed atretching down to the' master now reposng from his toil, formed a picture solemn, heartatirring, and impressive. Ml that music, could add to the effect of this scene was produced by the pure harmony of the Dom-Chor, opening the funeral service with softest strains of sacred music, rising at a distance, and preparing the hearts of all present for the full effect of the discourse pronounced by the of ficiating clergyman, who dwrelt on the brilliant career and the modest virtues of the deceased. The funeral procession, headed by Kiss, assisted by six fellow-pupils of Rauch, and carrying theOrdern of the deceased, passedof necesity through the parts of the town most adorned and emnbellished by the works of Rauch's hands, and It seemed s though the colosal statues of Frederick the Great, Blucher, Gneisenau, Yorck, Scharnhorst, and Bulow, had come on purpose, with the thousands of living mourners that lined the streets, to take their sorrowful leave of the master now on his way to his last long home. The hearse was, in addition to the usual attendants, flanked by 12 artist of Prusaia, bearing branches of palm in their hands, and followed on foot by every member of the Academy of Arts, and these were succeeded by an intermible line of equipages of the Royal Family and numerous members of the nobility and gentry. Prince Frederick William, as I have already mentioned, arrived at the Ilagueon the afternoon of the 4th inst. PrinceFrederick of the Netherlands, and also the Prussian Minister at the Hague, went as far as Rotterdam to meet him, and he was welcomed at the raUway station on arriving at the Hague by our Minister there, Sit Ralph Abercromby. The young Prnce aid his respects to the King and Queen of Hollan , and dined subsequently with the Princew Frederick of the Netherlands, and on the following day received a return visit from the King and the Prince of Orange. His Royal Highnes leftthe Hague yesterday, and arrived here early this norn. lug, and immediately repaired to the Prince of Prussia's palace to walt on his father and mother. In the afternoon he proceeded to Charlottenburg, to pay his respects to the K and Queen. Senator Mohring has arrived here from Hamburg, on a second visit, which is understood to have for its object a loan of 10,000,000 marks banco in silver. The reports we receive from that place describe the panic there as by no means at an end; fresh failures are mentioned as having occurred, and more are spoken of as imminent; andthe whole measure of the loan of 15,000,000 by the Hamburg Government for the purpose of facilitating discounts In spoken of as perfectly inadequate to meet the enormous demands of the Hamburg Bourse. HAMBURG. (rns on owi coi) HAMBURG, Do 8. I have already Informed you of the resolution come to by the Senate and Birghersohaft of this city to form a "Discount Bank," 'with a capital of 15,000,000 marks bhco, instead of 30,000,000, as originally proposed. The office for discounting has already been opened in the saloon of the Bank, and the firt portion of the capital required (5,000,000), oni the State Treasury depositing the securities de- manded by the Bank,-5,160 rgdorf, a 7,383 Hamburg-!erlin Railway shares, with other Sate securltles,-hss been deposted in ths hands of the bank authorities, in lieu of silver, for the present. The remaining 10,000,000 have to be ri by means of a loan upon the moat eligible terms possible, and paid in eilver Into the Bank; and rumours are afloat that negotiations are being carred on with the Bank of Prussia for tbis supply, but whether there be any reliable grounds for this assertion or not is at present unknown. However, it is certain that yesterday morning the "Hamburg Discount Bank for 1857" commenced its operations, and, as I have been credibly informed, bils to the amount of about 800,000 marks have been discounted, extreme precaution being used in the aelec. tion of the paper, and hints thrown out to the merclants that, unless under very pressing circumstances, they should not avail themselves of it, in order to avoid its too rapid absorption. This may account for the smallnles of tha amount paid out yesterday. So far so good. In consequence of this arrange. ment a better feeling prevailed on 'Change; but on the fact becoming known towards the close of the day that as many as a dozenl additional firms had been compelled to atop payment, and that others were likely to followr, thle favourable impreeion was diminihed by the fear that the sall amount of 16,000,000 wrould not sufice to do more than afford a temporary relief. Forty-nine firms that have suspended payrment bave to appear before the Ohamber of Commnere~e to choose administrators to examine their books, who will have to decide whether such fir-ns are to be con-. sidered solvent and able to pay if timeo be allowred them3 to carry on their business under a committee, or to be declared at once Insolvent, and consequently to wrind up forthwith in the usual manner, the creditors having the benefit of the lawr of bankruptcy of 1799 in their favourj The finm of H. Pontoppidan, whose bills upon Mr. Westenholz of London, have alwys been taken in prefereuce to those of many other reQspectable house,i, and which has trnactions to a very considerable extent in the Danush dosninions (£r. Pontoppidan being Danish Consul-General in thi; city), is reported to have refused bills for want of specie yesterday; but It Is expected that the firm will receive support fromn thle Danish Government. T he old firm of Hamilton, Koch, and Co., and those of Lavetz and Koch, C7ampe and Meyer, G. H. Lutze and Co., C. X. Staslin, F. 0. Schubach,. I Rucker, C. Godett, and Heine and Flejachmann, have all stopped, but the amount of their liabilities is said not to be very considerable. The rate of discount charged by the Discount Bank Is 10 per cent., and will probably contlinue at that figure, but the Treasury bills recently lsueod as advances upon merchandise are being done at 9* and even 9 per cent. The shares of the .North German Bank ha>ve fallen considerably of late, having shown a very large aunount of bills on hand, which they have discounted in aid of houses that have thereby been enabled to get through their difficulties This bank has rendered valuable service to the merchants during the crisist We learn by telegral from Copenhagen, under date of the 6th ncr, that the Co ammittee of Deputies of the Exchange, the Bask, and Finance Department intand presenting a petition to the bMnisrter of Finance for a loan to the Bnk of 3,000,000 reichsthalers.

DISCLOSURES OFP TE INDrAY DRUMI MAJOR, "SERAPHIM." The following is the depouitiou of the Drum-Major Seraphm escamed from Delhi), referred to yesterday in the letter of our Calcutta Correspondent :- "Antonio Seraphim, Drum-Major of the 72d Regiment, sttes-' I am a Christian of the Roman Catholic persuasion. One day in Juns last there was a disturbance in the lines of my regiment, atid the Sepoys went aboat shouting that European troops were coming ain thenm The oolonel came down and quieted them. Toh same scene took plaos on the following day; on the evening of the third day, at 9 o'clook, the whole of the troops at Neemuch matinied. The offioers of my regiment went away in a body. Troop era were riding about in every direction, and shots were being irea I and the other Chri.tian drmnmers, b ndboys, 4c,, hid ourselves in our huts, hoping that tho Sepoys would go away., and that we sbould then be able to escape. They did not, and we were discovered by some sowars and Sepoys; the former wnted to ki us, but the Sepoys id, No, it is better to take them with us' About 1 o'clock that day they commenced their march towards Delhi, Sudaree Slngb of the cavalry being tbeir general, We and our families were in the charge of the guard who escorted the treasure, &c. On the march we were not at first;closely watched, but, when within about four stages of Agra, Sheik Boodye, of the Grenadier Company, 72d Regiment, who had been sent in as a spy, came baok i camp and sid that some letters had been sent from camp into Agra The Sepoys aocused the Christians of having seut them, and the band harildar, who was a Mussulman, aid he had seen some of us writing. On this some of the Sepoys wanted to have us killed, but the others sid, ' We wil take them to Delhi and make them over to the King.'J We were then placed in close con&fnement. By this mean that we were not, a previously had been the cae, allowed to go into the fields Without a guard, nor were our wives permitted to go into the bazaar for food. Daring the fight near Agrs we were kept under a guard in the villae of Pa. tourie, about two miles in the rear of the battlefield. After the fight was over the Sepoys were greatly seraged, because they heard that the native Christians at Secundra and elsewhere had been armed. Orders were ismed to guard us very strictly and to give us no oppor tunity of escaping. The mutineers remadned for some days at Muttra, and then took us on to DelhL The enaamped outside the Delhi gate betreen the Queen's gospital and the walls. They went out to fight theXuropean troops, and we were left behind with the tresure, &e.; but wlien the force was beaten back. and the wounded men came in, a large house near the KotwaLee was converted into a hospitea, and the married Chrtians with their famiies were sent there; the unmarried remained outsde In the camp. We were told that if one of us attempted to escape All the others would be killed. I remained in the same house unti the 14th Inst., when we had no means of getting food; sometimes it was given to us, and sometimes money; our wives were allowed to go Into the bazrar, and occasionally we were permitted to go with an esoort into the regimental " On the 14th of this mouth, during the conuftuon caused by the advance of the English force, the guard left the hospital where I was. I found an opportunity and Red; the gtelhi ae was the only one open, and, As the grass-outters were bringng in foddzr for the cavalry horses, I got tIrough; the Sepoys were rushing about In all directions, but being in native clothing I was not recognized. I told the men con,fined with me that I Intended to go to Agra; they would not leave their families, so I came avwy alone. Near Foreedabad my clothes were taken from me by some Goojur villagers, but after that I was not molested. The dress I now wear was given to me In the fort. I was afrAid to go to the English camp, as the Sepoy pickets were between me and It, and if they had seen me going in that direction I should have been shot. ' lad you no opportunlty of esaping whlle on the line of march?-Yes, during the first few days any one of us oould have got away from the Sepoys, but we were afrid of the Bheels and other villagers, and we could not havo taken our faniies with us. We thought that s we approhed Agra the same opportunities would be given us, but, as I have sad before, we were plaoed in confinement, and too closely wtched to admit of any attempt at escape. "Between Neemuch and Agra were you jolned by any body of mutineers, or by any people of flunenoo ?-A band of men, fair-faced, like A=fghs, from Tonk, joined the camp, but I do not know of any other. " From the conversation of the Sepoys did you gther that they were in oorreapondenoe 'with people at Delhi or Agra, or that from the latter place thy expected to get asatance either in men or supplies ?-No; they never talked about their plans in my hearing ;they used to teU us about the differeut regiments at Delhi, and how they Would kill all Ferlnghees, &c. "Were no messengers or letters received from Ag or Delhi, or despatched thereto ?-About 10 days after leaving Neemuch some camel sowars were enterWtaed; they useI to take and bring letters, but to whom or from vrwer I know not. The correspondence went from and was taken to the General's tent, which was a long way off the plae where we were kept "Do you know about what quantity of ball ammunition your regiment brought away from Neemuch?-No; eah man took as nuch sa he liked, the remainder was carried on camels. " Before the battle near Aga, or after It, did they receive trom Agra or elsewhere any supply of led, powder, guns, &c. -They took from the Uwar Rajah's camp four gun, besides horsea, camels, &c. but so far as I kow no ead or other stores were recoived by them after the battle; they had scarcely any ammunLition, left,. and the axtillery men for this reason were most anxious to be off. "Did they endeavour to obaia a freh suppl from Agra or elsewhere ?-When at Mutta they sent to aBurtpore for guza and ammunition, but did not get any, nor did they to my kmowledge receive any from elsewhere. " Prevfous to the day of battle, or afterwards, were they joined by any people from Agra ; and, if so, did you reoognize any of them to be of influence in this. city2-A great number of armed police, gaol guards, and prisoners joined them on the day ol battle and at Muttra. At the latter place I saw Wuzeer Khan, native doctor, and a number of aussulmans whom I knew to have been'In service at Agra; at Jeith I sw Meer Khyat All, and heard that hewas goln to BuUubghur. "oi d you never at any time hear the Sepoys mention the names of any natives of infuenoe in this city as friendly to them and furnishing them with Informatioa or supplies of any deacription,-I mean such men as Bisharut Alf Mob. been, deputy collector, the Suddur-oollab, &c.?-No, the Tebsildar of Futbehpore w, I heard, made prisoner by them, and I constantly saw men brought into camp, bat I do not know who they were ")Do you knowwhethera large quantity of lead,sent from the city on the 4th of July, ever reached the rebel camp?No; I do not know. "When thecamel men of whom you spoke came into camp, did, you never hear the Bepoys say where they had come from, or what news the had brought?-hen a camel man was seen coming there tas always great excitement among the Sepoys, and they unsed to rush away to the General's tent; but 1 never heard anything about the letters. "Who 'Were the most conspicuous men in tho rebel camp?-Sudaree Singh. of the cavalry, was the general; Ghous Mahomed, brigade major; Goolz r Khan was colonel, and Nuttoo Puttuck, adjutant of my regiment. "Were you and the other Christins maede to pertorm any duty 1-On the march we generall had to play as usual, also on parade days. When the general passed the quarter guard we played the usual ruffle. Once in Delhi we had to attend a parade, at'which anorderwa read "Do you know of any Europeans or Christln besides your own comrades being in Delhi ?-I heard that the sergeant-major of the 28th and a lady are there, also the drammers and band boys of the 38th, 54th, and 74th regiments."
PREA0C2ING AND PREACHING. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIbEES. Sir,-I ventur, to differ from " Habitan in Siccoe when he asserts that the sermon for the poorer claes should he shorter than the liturgical servce. I bAve been a preaher (cztempoc, as It is termed) of the Gospel, In the Established Church, for upward. of 15 years5 during which time mry churoh haa been attended by as full and regular congregations as any church, similarly situated, within the diocess to which I belong. M mornlng sermoue re, however, shorter than I could wish, owing to the long time previously taken up by the liturgical servioe; and I eonfidently affirm that were I lawfully enabled to curtall such service by one-half and add the time thus saved to that portion whioh at present remains for the sermon, my congregation would soon be doubled Let the prewent mnuch. talked-of Baptist pr-ccher be compelled to read through our whole morning servioes before commencing hIs sermon, and he would inevitably lose the larger portiou of hia present congregation within a month. Mr. Spurgeon'is ermon usually occuples an hour, vwherea his other services do not in the aggregate take up much more than a third of an hour. Another disadvantage, too, he escapes, under which we labour-the disadvntage of commencing his sermon after au hour and a half's previous reading. We already owe much to "' Habitans in Slcoo ;n may his powerful pen sti further aid us In effecting a curtailment of our Church services vt. s:.^ AN OXFOtD MAN_ Dec. 10.
WIZTEIR ASSZES. WESTERW (TRflTTT WINCaESTEB, DEC, 10. IBefore Mr. JustCe WILLES.) Fanny Harris was indicted for the wilfuA murder of hir female ohild at Alverstoke, On the 17th of July. Mr. Poulden and M1r. Beetham were oounsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Hooper (at the request of the Court) defended the prlsoner. The facts 0a proved on the part of the prosecutIon were these:-_ The prisoner ws a fine young woman, about 27 yes of ge In the yearl65he wasin sheservioeof Colonel Evn, v resided at Forton Barraks. In May lat sbe went to Portaea, being then in the family way; she stated she was the wife of a Mr. Smith, who was then at Alderahott. She became acquainted with a Mrx. Bheppard. They took lodgings together at a Mm Carpenter's, where they remained a few days, and then they removed to the house of a Mr SnookU. On the 22d of June the prisoner Wsr conJined of a temale obild. Up to that time sbe reoeived remittanoe of mony and appeared to have sufficient for her wants, and .he hid provided two suits of baby clothes. Ater her con. finement she behaved kindly towards her infant, and treated it with affection; but her means then became less, and she was obliged to pledge some of its clothesL On Thursday the l6thof July, the child being then threeweeksandthree days old, the prisoner told irrs. Snooks she should go to Ports" o see her cousin, who would perhaps give the child corae clothes, and herself half.a-sovereign. Between 3 and 4 o'clock thet afternoon she borrowed two shawls of Mr Sbeppard, and then left the house, taking her chUd with her. Between 4 and 5 o'clock that afternoon she called at Mrs. Crpentes,w here shae had formerly lodged. She had not then any child with her. She aked Mrs. Carpenter to write to Smith, her husband, and beg him to end her some money, sashe wasingieat distress, and r. Carpenterwro%e the letter for her. Mrs CApenter then uaked her how she had got over her confinement, and if the child was lvinZ. The prioner said it was not for It was stillborn; and she then aked Mr Carpenter if she could Again let her have her lodgings, and upon her replying in the affirmave she said ahe would come the next morning; she then lefL At 8 oclock the next morning the prisoner canme to XM Carpenter's. She appeared much oonfused and disorded, her clothes were saturated with water, and she aid bhe had come cross the water. She took breslcfaat snd then went to bed, where she remained tll between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon. She then got up, and she was silent and thoughtfuL She sad she was very nervous aAd did not like to be left alone. She said she shouldo andl see her mother, 'uho lived in the neighbourhood of Wiinchester, and she left m Cpenter' The prisoner had left Mrs. Snooks, with her baby, on Thursdy, the 16th of July. On Friday, the 17th of July, a little girl named Fanny Stephens was walking by the side of the moat outside the town of Portsmouth, when she saw something in tbe water, She gve an alarm, and it wasfound that what shehad seen was the dead body of a chfld dres An inquest was held, but there was no evidenoe offered except the mere finding of tha child, an open verdict was re turned, aud the child was buried. The polioe then com. menoed making inquiries, and they caused handbills to be printed giving a description of the clothes which had been found upon the child. One of these bills attracted the notice of Mr Snooks, who, with Mrsm Sheppard, went and saw the clothes, and they swore that thoee were the clothes whioh were on the prisoner's child at the time she left 31rs Snookses house on the 16th of July. The body was exhumed, but the face was so much decomposed that the features could not be recognizedL An officer then went in earch of the prisoner, and found her at her mother's. She had never told her mother thAt she had been confned. The officer said to the prisoner,-" I want to see you about a child. You have been lodging at Portsmouth with a person named Sheppard. When you left her on Thursday you had yourchild wnthyou. Ca lseeit r Shesaid,-"yiNo;you cannot." The officer then said, "A child answering the description of yours was found drowned in the most at Goas port lat Friday, and I shall take you into custody on suspicion of being the per.on zwho placed it there; you must go with me to Goeport?' She maid, "1I never gut it there; you wl finLd It a right when o gt tto Gosport. I left the child with a esn who, I hope, will take care of it." The prisoner dinot appear at the tme to e fritened. Mr. HooPr . In addresing the jury, urged that theonlv fact agaiast the prisoner were that she had had a oi and thas a child havin on the clothes which bad been those of the prisoner's ws found in the water, but upon suoh fats alone they oould not oome to a just and atisfactory conclusion that the prisoner had put the ohild there. There were three points which ought to be proved-first, that the child was that of the prisoner; secondly, that It was drowned; and, thirdly, that the prioner wa the person who had drowned it. He submittW that there was no evlidenoo to prove that the prisoner was the persn who ha drowned the child, and he premod upon them that the prisoner might be tolIing the truth when she stated that she had plaed the child irka personat Gosport and that her seduoer might have disposed of the child. Mr. Justice WiTL s then summed up. lbe jury retired for some time, and on their return gve a verdiot of Guilty, five of them recommending her to mercy, The JUDGX then passed upon the prisoner the awful sen tenoe of death. At the concluion of the sentence she put out her hand as if to support herself bythe ral of the dock. She was then led away. Frederick Deane, who wwa yesterday convicted of the manslaughter of Mrs George, a patient of his, by neglecting her in her oonfnement, was now put to the bar for sentence. Mr. Justice WiLrxs then addressed him. He had been convicted of the manslughter of Mr George, a womau he was attending as A patient. He appeared to have been a man In an honourable profesdon-a rofession no man was mere diposed to hold in honour than himself, but by the verdict of the jury he had been convicted of gross neglect in the managment of the ose of that unhap woman, by which she had come to a most painful death. He should make no observations at all to Aggravate the feelings of a man who, after so many ears'practice as he appeared to have ha hald in respect by his neighbours was breught by his act into a position so miserable as that in which he now stood. He must aIso remark that punishment was In. ffied by law, not so much for causlng pain to the indivi. dual as to offer a warning to others, lest they should fall into an offence of the like description, and it was a truism to say th4t the profesdon to which he belonged scarcely required, as it appeared by his unhappy case, such a lemon as his punishmeut must read. He did not therefore think it necewary to pass a sentenoe which should rank among the higher grades of punishment inflicted upon persons who took awa y the lves of others-that of penal servitude; ut he must pass a sentenoe of long imprisonment, otherwise he should not mak the sense ne entertained of the awful responsibility which a man incurred by his culpable neglect of a person in her moat critioca moment, who had confided her cae to hit skill and his car The sentence of the Court was that he should be imprlioned in the oommon gaol for 18 months.
MIDLAND fTRcl1mp LINCOLN, Dzc. 10. .Lne commIssions for this town And county Were opened yesterday before Mr. George Boden, barrister.at-law, one of the commisdoners of amize and gaol delivery for the preeent Winter C,rcuit who afterwards Attended Divine servioc in the Cathedral, Mr. Justice Crompton having been detaced at Nottingham. ln the city gaol there is only one prizoner for trial, charged with child murder. The county calendar contains the names of 31 prisoners, charged with the following offences;-Child murder, 1; attempt to drown, 1; rape. 2; unnatural offence, I; felo- , ous wounding, 3; arson, 2; burglary, 2; night-poaching, 4; fbiusebre-king, 2 i possession of and uttering counterfeit coin, 4; highway robery, 4; embsziement, 1; fowl steAl. iug, 3; larceny, 1. At 9 o'clock this morning Mr. Jnstice CR0EPTON pro. ceeded to charg thegand jury of the city, and inmriedi. ately afterwards tied tke following case - hansfield Woolfitt, a married woman of middl ae, was indicted for the wilful murder of her infant child. Mr. FLOWXBS conducted the prosecution; Mr. STxPHZ, at the request of the leaned Judge, wxatched the caue for the prisoner. It appeared thbt the prisoner, who was the wife of a corkcutter at Lincoln, went herself on the morning of Sun the 16th of August lt, into a nei hbour's house, and told her that she had nexrly cut off her baby's head, begging her to oome into her (the prisoner's) house. The witnes sid thatahe dared not go in alone, and she called Another neigh. bour, and then a lad was summoned, and they all went in together. Upon entering the house they found that the prlsoner's statement was quite true. On the floor lay the chlld with its throat so cut that the head was nearly severed from the body and by the side of it was a oorkeutting knife oo;;;;2 with blood. The child was the survivor of twins, which had been born In the month of December last year, and of which the prisoner had always seemed fond. She herself upon going into the house with the neighbounr whom she had sum moned exclaimed, "Oh ! my poor dear child, whom Iloved so much !" Upon being asked how she came to do such a thing, she said she could uot help it; but also that her hus. band's il.treatment of her was the cause of it. There was some evidence that, in point of fack her husband had not behaved well to her, and that they hPd some time bofore been separted for a short time. The srgeon, however, who wasoLaedinimmediately after the child had been killed, expresed a very confident opinion that she was then insane and incapable of undertanding that the act which she had done was wrong. Some expressions o2 her own strongly confirmed thi view. She said on one ocasion that she should have killed berself as well as the chiId, but that the knew if she did so she would not go to heaven, where the child wan From the time of her confinenient in December her neighbours had noticed a change in her, and she herself had, before the occurrenoe in question spoken of committing suiclde and of ending her days in ar asylum. She had also complained of restless night., and the had w ild and vant look. The sgeon Btated that the bearing of twins and over-laction, or the too long suckling of the child, woulid have a tendency, by their de. bilitating effect, to bring on mental derangement, and that In that state she would be likely to eaggerate Any unknd treatment towards her by her husband. Mr. STmPnxi briefly addrosd the juV for the prisoner, oontending that the evidence clearly negatived the prisoner's responsibility for the dreadful act, which her hankd had done, and proved her to be a person not deserving of punish. inn,but re ca*reul and conxiderate treatment. The learned JUDGE summed up. The jury found the prisoner Not Guilty, on the ground Of insanity. Ilia LoRDSRu then proceeded with the county business, and when the grand juy were called over only 13 a nsered to their names, and of these one was Sir Charles Anderson, who, being the prosecutor In a case of night poaching ;whtch st.ood for trial at these asaizes, begged to be excused from acting as a gand uryman in the dispol of that cas.

Tile consignee of the cargo, Flores, a Brazilian wber-inat. havirg been allowed to zntervene aad pat ia a coli.u f.r the c&rgo, the Crown now prayed not only that the deuree uf the Court below might be atfirmed, bat also that the cargo, which is held iu deposit at St. helena until paymtieit of tbe penalties imposed on Pinto and Co., mieht be culidounned, aud that penailties raight be imposed on Flores. Sir F. THEIGIOR, hMr. FORSYTH, Q.C., and Dr. Twiss 'Were heard for the appellants and interveners, aud a report of their arguments appeared in 'Vise Time. of the 2d and 3d Inst. The QUEmN'S ADVOCATE(with whoin were the AttorneyGeneral and Dr. Jouner), in openitig the cae for the Crown, observed that after the sentence of the Cortlr of Vice-Admiralty the Crowna wa bound to or,teot the offioers of the Philomel, who had effeoted ghe aeizure. and that it was limasterial whether the procee4ings of the Vice-Adm;iralty Court were strictly regular or irregular, for their Lordahips now had a perfectly original case hetore them. It was contended by Dr. Twisa chat the Crc, wu had no right to pray for the conde=ation of Flores iu penalties; bat he was at a loss to understand why, when Flores had been allowed to put in a claim for the cargo and for damages, the Crown should be precladed fronU praying for his condemnAtion in penalties. He had vi4 lted an Enelish satute, and the offence with which he was charg-d was com. rntted within the jurisdiction of the Court. The learned gentleman then weat through the fact4 of she cae, contending that Messrs. Le tSeour, the owners, and Eo,quard, the master of the vessel, had not exercised due caution ia amcertaining to what use the vessel WAs to be put before alowinher to proceed to such a suspiciotls port as Ambriz, on the West Coaot of Africa ; an4 that Messrs. Pinto and Co. raust hAve been aware that Flore,, and also Garrids, who introdnoed him to them, were notorious slavedealers. The ATroaNEY-GNgERAL, Who followed on the same side, said this was a case to which the (Government attached considerable importance, on account of the charge which it Involved againat British subjects of comuplicity in a slavetrade transaction. They had come to the resolation to direct a most searching investigation into the case, believing that it would be utterly impossible for them to renew the representations they had been making to other Governments on the subject of the slave trade if they permitted charges of this kind, in which British subjects were implicated, to pass without inquiry. He thougbt, too, that the personas against whom sach charges were brought would be glad, if iniocent, to have an opportunity of clearing themselves by satisfactory teatimony. Messrs. Pinto admitted that, fromn information they had received since the seizure, they had ascertained that a correspondence had taken place between the Portuguese and Brazilian Governmentd on the subject of Florae, in consequence of which the Portaguese Governmerit in 1854 withdrew from bin permission to reside in the province of Angola. Yet this man, banished by the Portuguese Governinent as an aocused slave-dealer, was taken up by three British merchants, who entered into large transactions with himn, and shipped goods for him to a place where the slbve-trade was carried on. It was due to these individuals themselves, much more to the nation at large, that the suspicious circumistances attending this transaction should be fully investigated; and if any expressions had been used in the interrogatories calculated to give offence to innocent persons he much regretted it. The case consisted of three parts-the first relating to Flores, the second to Pinto and Co., and the third to MIessrs. Le Sueur, the oswners of the vessel. Flores, at any rate, was well aware that lawful traffic could not be carried on at Ambriz, that the Portuguese Government had taken possession of it in cousequence of the unlawful traffice carried on there, and that it was watched by cruisers of all nations. There was nothing to rebut the presumption that the purpose to whioh Flores intended to put the goods sent by the Deslandes and the Newport was an nnlawful purpose. It was admitted that the cargo of the Deslandes was received at Ambriz by the agent of Flores, but no ccount whatever was givea of that agent or of the ultimate destination of the goods. Flores appeared to have beea entirely devoted to the slave traffic from 1849 to 1851, having been a partner in a Brazilian house which carried on that trade up to 1851, when, in consequence of a decree of the Brazilian Government, It took a new direction towards the Eilavannab. By the end of 1853 Flores had made remit. tances to Cuba to a large amount, of which 10,0001 waLs remitted directly to Pinto and Co., and 6,0091. also reached their hands indirectly. Pinto and Co. kuew that these funds had been sent to them by Flores from Cuba. Did that circumstance require no explanation? How could Flores have realized that large slu by licit commeroe at Cuba? Could it be suppo-ed that gentlemen of the experience of Messrs. Pinto entertained no suspicion as to the intention of two persons of the chracter of Flores and Garrido in purchasing goods to be delivered to them at Ambriz ? The trans. action, commenced with the suspicious circumstance of a remittance of money from Cuba, was carried on by three British merchants in utter ignorance, as they alleged, of the character either of the consignee or of the place at which the goods were to be delivered. By a natural transition he passed from Flores to Pinto and Co. Had those gentlemen no notice of the occupation of Flores? With no knowledge of Flores except through Garrido, whom they knew to be a bankrupt clerk, they not only entered into extensive traneactions with him, but received him and Garrido as visitors at their houses. Their Lordships must deal with this case as men of ordinary bdece. Courts of justice could not allow themselves to ie baffled by the assumption of wilful ignorance by persons entering into transactions of this nature. The learned gentleman next adverted to the subject of the cargo, and read the evidenoe of Consul Brand to show that the demi. johns, of which there were no less than a thousand, capable of coataining 6,000 gallons of water, were used in unlawful a well a3 In lawful traffic. His learned friend Sir F. Thesiger had made Some remarks apon the letter of tho Jadge of the Vice-Admiralty Court to the Secretary of State in explanation of the case. But that letter was not, as his learned friend had assumed, the udgment of the learned judge; It was a mere statement of is personal information on the matter; Pnd he contended that the reasoning which the judge had adopted was now proved to be correct, and wa, moreover, the only legitimate mode of reasoning to be followed in construing the statute under which he was proceeding. With regard to Messrs Le Sueeur, to whomn he did not impute any guity knowledge, he submitted that the property of the owner was by the statnte made dependent upon the conduct of the hirer of the sbip, and that if the ship oarried an unlawful carg oshe vas liable to forfeiture. Sir F. TESIGicE replied upon the whole case. Mr. PEMBEIRTON Lmmmr, In the course of the reply, asked whether any expl3nation was given of the nonexamination of Flores ? Sir F. THFSlXGB said, there was no reason why he should be examined by Pinto and Co., the question being whether they were liable to penalties, and his evideuce not being necessary to prove their case. No doubt his cross.examinas tion would have thrown a taint upon their case, and if he (Sir F. Thesiger) had been defending Pinto and Co. before a jury against a elaim for penlties ho should certainly have abstained from calling Flores, unless sasolutely compelled to do so. Dr. LuslnINGToN observed that Flores, when he made his claim, amight have ftled an allegation containing his version of tbe affair. Sir F. Tutsic.ER concluded by submitting that, after the pain whichb had been caused to Messrs. Pinto, and the injury which had been done to their charater by the cruel mode of proceeding adopted by the Crown, they had a right not merely to ask their Lordships to set aside a judgment of the Court of Vice-Admiralty pronounced without jurisdiction, and to declare that this adventure was without the slightest taint of illegality, but also to ask forcsuch costs and damages as their Lordships might think proper to award. Their Lordships took time to consider their decision. DECEMBER 10. (Before Lord JTustioC KNIGHT BVucE, Dr. LUSMINGTON, Mr. PEMBERTON LEiGH, and Sir E. RYAN.)

The appellants are the coheiresses and next of kin and the widow and administratrix of the late Mr. Dyce Sombre. The Court below, without entering into the merits of the case, dismissed the suit on the ground that it had not been commenced within 12 years after the cause of action had arisen, and waS therefore barred by a regulation of 1803. The ground of the appeal was that 12 years had not elapsed when the suit was Commenced, but even if it had, that the lunacy of Mr. Dyec Sombre and the steps taken by him previous to his lunacy brought the case within the exceptions to the regulation upon which the respondents relied. fr.

ROILS' COURT. CHANCMRY-LANET DC.- In0 ;j1L AX1LU±UY-U(NERAL V. TBE DEAN AND CANONS OF lVINDSOR, LN BE THE MILITARY PN(X?CTs (I TWT-T<A- llleJore tae MASTER of ae ROLLS.) -Lne narure or the arguments in tbis case having been previously reported, and the arguments being now so far concluded s s to put the whole facts of the case before the Court, it may be as well to give a short resume of themThe Castle of Windsor having beea built by Wiliam tbe Conqueror, and subsequently rebuilt by Henry I., the latter King added a chapel and a college to it. This chapel was completed by Edward Ill., and dedicated by bim "to the honour of the Bleseed Virgin, St. George, and King Edward the Confessor." In 1348 King Edward, having ordained the Order of the Garter, granted to the Custos and Canons of Windsor "the advowsons of the rectories of Wyrardisbury, Soutbampton, and Uttoxeter, and so much from the Royal treasury as would amount to 1,0001. A-year, and be sufficient for the rmaintenance and honest diet of the canons, ministers, and 24 poor knights, impotent of themselves And inclining to poverty." By further ordinence Edward III. decreed that so many veteran knighle reduced to poverty as equalled the cou;panlons of the Order of the Garter should be appointed -4 to offer prmyers, receiving their wherewithal to live, inasmuch as they had not sufficient of their own." In 14929 and in the reign of Henry VI. an Act of lParliameut was passed, denominating the custos, canons, &c., "the Warden, Dean, and Canons of the Free Chapel of St. George's, Windsor." In 1482 (Edward IV.) a statute was passed, rellvring the dean and canons from supporting the poor knights, on the ground that the canons had enough t do to support themselves and their ministers, in the reign of Henry VIL the pwor knights petitioned for a repeal of this last Act, and were subsequently given house room -within the precincts of the Csatle of Windsor itself. In 1511 Henry VIIL grafted one Peter Narbonne a poor knight on the dean and canons, and promised to give the latter some further addition to their lands toward the maintenance of Narbonne and others of his order. In 1522 a statute of the Order of the Garter ordained that 13 poor knights Who had not wherewithal to live should have in the chapel or colege sustentation " convenient for their good prayers, the honour of God and St. George." In 1546 the dean and canon Assigned to Henry VIIL certain lands in exchange for other oroperty which that monarch agreed to asign them and, in the sme year Henry by his will gave certain lands representing the vAiue of 600. per annum more or less, to the deans and canons In trust, eto say masses for his soul, for the preaching of certain sermons, and for the payment of 12 pence a day to 13 poor Inights," and directed his successor to see his will in theso respects conscientiously carried out. Edward VI. not only carried out his father's wishes, but added considerably to the endowments directed to be bestowed upon the dean and canons, the lands given in addition by him being denominated " lands under the new dotation," in contradistinction to the lands possessed by the canons under their original and previous grants. From 1547 to 1552 theproceeds of these lands wereapplied,amongother purposes, for the benefit of the poor knights, but in 1453 Edward VI: anulled the former statutes of the charity without ro. viding for the austentation of the poor knights at alL Ulpon the death of Edward, however, Queen Mary, and her successor, Queen Elizabeth, re-enacted the former statutes, the latter sovereign issuing letters patent, under which 6001. a. year out of the lands held by the dean and canons was to be appropriated for tho benefit of the poor knights, as directed by the will of Henrv VII., and the letters patent issued agreeably to the same. Their lands had of late years so considerably inereased in value that the surplus revenues of them now represent about 14.0001. a-year, and the question raised in the present case is, -whether the Knights of Windsor are not entitled to come in and share in toe benefit of this increased revenue, or whether the gift to them is restricted to the specific sums mentioned and decreed by Henry V1I L)The poor knights, since the time of Wllim I. (833 called the military Knights of indsor, contend that they have a right to share in the increase mentioned above, wile the Dean and Canoons of Windsor elaun, on their own behalf the sole and independent control over and administration of these revenues, subject to the speoific payment directed to be made to the The Attorney-General, the SolicUtor-General, Mr. If Palmer, MIr. leed, Mr'Follett, Mr. Selwyn, Mr. Cairns, fr.

VICE-CHANCEILtORS COITTRT n- -in bFIEBS V. RROWN. tifiore ric-Chancd1or Sir W. P. WOOD.) - nr. ;JAINS concluded his reply in this heavy copyright case, which has beea before the Court during 12 days, the actual discussion having (as the Vice-Chancellor remarked at the conclusion of the xeply) occupied LO less than 61 hours. His HoXouR has reserved judgment, but, the case being now concluded, we proceed to give a summary of the facts and arguments:- The suit is instituted to restrain the saie and publication of a work called aontanweau's French-English and RnglishFrench Dictionary, and for the usual account of profits suade by the sale of copies already sold. The author of tbe work in question, M. Contatseau, is the Professor of French at Addiscombe College, and the other defendants, Messrs. Brown, Lonrgman, and Co., are the well-known publishers. The plaintiff, Dr. Spiers, is a British sujecw, reside= tt Paris, where he holds the appointment of Professor of English at several public institutions. He is the author of eeveral works, and among them of a French and English Dictionary, in two volumes octavo, and of a smaller work known as Spiers's School Dictionary, being an abridgement of the other two. In two of these dictionaries-namely, the French.English 8vo., and the School Dictionary-ljr. Spiers claims to be entitled to copyright in this country, and it is for the alleged infringement of this coyrsht by IK. Contanseau that the present suit is institutea. the plaintiff's larger dictionaries were first commenced by him in 1835, at the request and wider the auspices of hl. Guizot, then Minister of Public Instruction, the system on which they were arranged being, as alleged by thebill of complaint, for the most part entirely ntovel in dictionaries of the two languages, and the works themselves being far more copious and extensive than any dictionaries theretofore published. The sources from which they were composod included, as shown on the title-page, the Frenci dictionaries of L'Acad6mie, Laveaux, Boiste, Bescherelle, &c. - the English dictionaries of Johnson, Webster, Riohardson, &c., and many special dictionaries and works of both languages. The original characteristics of the work were set forth in the plaintiffs bill under 23 different heads, and, in addition to these, the typographical arrangement was insisted on as altogether new, the chief features of this arrangement being the separation of the acceptations from the idioms, which open a new paragraph; and the printing of definitions (when given at all) in parentheses and in a different type, to prevent their being confounded with the proper equivalents. The period occupied by Dr. Spiers in the composition of this work ettended over 14 years, the large English-French dictionary being published in the year 1846, but the French-English part not being completed tUIl 1849. The English-French part was fi published in France, and in this, therefore, no copyright could of course be claimed. The French-English pirt, however, was first published iEn land, and duly registered at Statiouers'-hall; and this had aXso been the case with the abridgment or school dictionary afterwards composed by Dr. Spiers, and published in 1851. On the publication of each of the larger worlks the use of it in French colleges was duly authorized by the Minister of Public Instruction, after having been submitted to the examination of the council of that department, and the bill alleged that since the publication a considerable profit had been realized by their sale, the work having already gone through several editions. Each of the works in question, as welU the abrldgement, is preceded by a prefare in which the alleged original characteristics are arranged under 10 different heads, and to each of these heads is annexed a short article explanatory of the plan adopted by the plaintiff with reference to each particular characteristic. At the commencement of the present year the work complained of was first published under the title of "A Practcal Dictionary of thc French and English Languages, composed from the Frenh Dictia-ries of the Acaderny, Boiste, Bec-elwc, &c.; from the English Dictionaries of Johnson, Webster, Richardson, dc.; and from Technological and ScientiJic Dictfonarles of both Languages.' This work of Contanseau is also preceded by a preface, in which the characteristics are arranged under seven heads. and a short explanatory article annexed to each, the work itself being in the form of a large manual in one volume. The grounds on which Dr. Spiers founds his charge of piracy against IL Contanseau are several,-the identity between the leading characteristics, the close resemblanoe between passages in the defendant's preface and that of the School Dictionary, the introduction by the defendant of numerous words and acceptations to be found only in the plaintiff's dictionaries, the fact of the defendant's work saounding in pecullarities, omissions, errors, and misprints, which also characterize the plaintifrs earlr editions, and on a general comparison of the two works. In support of these charges several instances Eelected from the two dictionaries were set forth in parallel columns in the bill of complaint. The case originally came before the Court before the vacation on an interlocutory motion for an inounotion, when a preliminary obiection was taken by the defendant's counsel to the title of Dr. Spiers to any copyright at all on two grounds,-narnely, first, that the works in question, though first published in England, were printed in France; and secondly, that they were publshed without any printer's name, contrary to the statute 2d mnd 3d of Victoria, cap. 12, sec. 2. The arguments on these objections having been heard, the Vioe-Chancellor, after consideration, was of opinion that they were not of sufficient weight to prevent the plaintff from proceedin$ with the motion for the injunction, which was again brought before his Honour during the vacation. An arragemeutwras then come to, by which the motion agreed to be turned into a motion for a decree; the question of infringement to be tried first by the Vice-chancellor alone, and, in the event of the plaintiff making out hi case, then the question of title to be heard by the Vice. ancellor, ated by a common law iude or judges, plaintiff *ad defendant botb ving their rlght to appeal fromn his fononr's judgment. The case WAs now, therefore, brought before the Court on the question of infringement only, and was supported by a vast numher of affidavits, exhibits, counter-exhibits (printed as well as written), documentary evidenoe in the shape of the original manuscri s of the several works, and a massof French and English dictionaries relied on by the defendant as the sources from which he composed his work. Among nume. rous affidavits filed on behalf of Dr. Spiers were affidavits by IL Braseur. the French tutor of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales; M. Merlet, Professor of French at the London University; and M. Delille, the French master at Christs Hospital and other educational institutions, aU of whom deposed to the originality of Dr. Spiers's dictionaries and their great superiority over those which had preceded them, an originality and superiority denied by the defendant. In addition to the case thus made by Dr. Spiers of the alleged similarities between the books, the common errors, misprints, omissions, &c., other paints were urged on bis behalf, ariing out of the defence and the documents produced by the defendants. Among these was the original manuscript by M. Contaseans, and the revises or proofEheets from which his work was printed. The defence set up by M. Contanean was, that he had commenced his French-English part in 184e, and completed it in the year 1850; that during its composition he had consulted not only single diotionanies of each language, bnt also double or bilingual dictionaries of both. Among these were Boyer, Cha4mbaud, De Uvirac, Cotbeu, Fleming and 2ibbins, Dettaneille, Nfugen4 Dc Porquez, Burenne, Tarer, Burn, And Delolme. These last two having been published respectively in 1852 and 1854, it was contended by the plantiff that they could not have served the defendant, whose Fronch-English MS., according to his own show n, was comppleted in 1850, and that Tarver's French-Enlish part, having only been published at the end of 1849. could not hAve served for the earlier portion of h1s work. In answer to many of the specific instances of piracy adduced by Dr. Spiers the defendant had cited these dictionariea as the source from which he had derived his words, meanings, and phrases, and in answer to other instances he had cited other dlctlonanie , from which it was shown that he could not have gathered them by reason of certain peculiarities either in the orthography or construction of the words, or their acoeptations ln additioR to this the defendant Adduced as proofs of his not having made a servile copy a list of errors which occurred in the work of Dr. Spiers, and not in his own. The inspection of the defendant's MS", however, showeed that the laree majority of these errors did ocur in that document, and bad, in fact, been corrected in the revise made by Dr. Cauvin, as the agent of Messrm Longman, the pub.. llshers. The defendant further alleged by lsfaain,vits (a he bed done In the preface of hiw-*ork) that he ha carried on an extensive correspondence with literery-men in France and England while engaged in his work. The only correspondence produced by him consisted of two latters from a Id Benoit (who had formerly been a clerk in Memrs. Long. mans' house), and one from a M. Laurat; while, on the other hand, the oorreesondence prodnoed by Dr. Spiers con - sisedof bundlesof lettersandnoteswhlchhad psd betweeI him and upwards of 100 correspondents, some of them being men of high literary end scientific eminenoe In both counr tries. Among other documents also produced by Al. Coxtanseau were certain letters which had passed between himself and his publishers which, (as contended by the plaintiff's counsel) afforded strong proofs of his want of famillarity with the English langune, and hbis consequent Incompetency to compoee such a work as the one which bore his name. It was further urged that as to many new words and other additions which undoubtedly existed in the dictionary of M. Contansean, these were to be acounted for by the fact of its having been published some years after Dr. Spiers's first editions, and these were the onlyeditions in respect of which the plaintiff was entitled to sue, being those which alone had been duly reRistered pursuantt the Copyright Acts. With respect to the use m7de by the defendant of Dr. Spiers's works he admitted that he had consulted the octavo dictionary (published in 1849) in a fair and legitimate manner; but that as to the school dictionary (published in 1851) his manuscript was completed before its publication, and that he had only oocasionally taken it up during the revision of his manuscript. Onthispartofthecase Dr. Splers produced a letter written by the defendant to him in December, 1851, in which he stated that although he had not seen the school dictionary at that time he had paid Messrs. Whittaker (the publishers) for 20 copies of It for the use of his priv te pupils and that be should sontinue to recommend it till his own was completed. It alEo appeared that on the publication of hls octavo Frenc,-EnglisA Dictionargy, 1849, Dr. Spiers had presented Xd Contaneeau, at Addiscombe, with a copy of that work, and also with a copy of his English-French part previously published in 1846 ( which he does not clabm copyright), and the plaintiff alleged that no mention had then been made by the defendant of his being engaged In the compodtion of a work of bis own. This was denied by an affidavit of X Contanseau and his wife, who deposed that it had been mentioned by the defendant, and that the plaintiff had thereupon advised him not to embark on what hetermed "a ruinous commercial speculation." On this respect there was a confaict of testinony, the plaintiff statig that such an observation might have been made by him at some subsequent interview, but certainly not in 1849. Further, the defendant alleged that he had not even servilely copied any part of the English.French octavo though he might have done so to any extent, that work not being protected by copyright, In answer to this numerous instances were adduced in the exhibits to prove that this allegation of the defendant was unfounded in faet. Several of the professors at Addiscombe College de. poeed to the fact of M. Contarseau havingibeen engaged for several years in the composition of hit dictionary, and to theLr beHef in his aptitude for the task and in the od. ginality of the work; but It did not appear that they had mtituted any comparison with those of Dr. Spieram Ai. davits were, however, made by Dr. Cauvin and others tese tifying a similar belief, and further stating that the coi. parisons which theT had made proved to them that the work had not been pirated, or servilely copled in any way. These were the cbief points in the case. Oie other, however, arose out of the appearance of the defendant's manuscript of the French-English pat, which he had stated to be commenced in 1848 and completed in 1850, and which le had produced as his original maustscript. It was disoovered on inspection made for that purpose by the plaintiff's solictor after the cause was In the paper for hearing, that severaQ of the sheets bore the watermark of 1852. On behalf of the defendant, and in reply to this discovery, it was urged at the bar that it was apparent on the face of the manuscript itself that some of the sheets were really parts of the original manuscript, aDnd that those bearing the watermark of 1852 had been rewritten by the defendant during the period which elapsed betweer the completion of his French-EnFlish part and the revision by Dr. Cauvin of the whole work im 1855. During the hearing of the case several further documents were prepared and handed in for the purpose of showing alleged differences between the several works, and supporting the statement madeby. Contanseau that he had taken his vocabulary from Bescherelle. These were, of course, met by cormter.documents thuts adding to the accumulated heap of matter, printed and written, submitted to *e considera'lon of the Court. Mir. CMR?S, Mr. GrFFAnx, and Mr. W. P. MunnAY, on behalf of Dr Spiers contended that the piracy was clea-ly madeout, nd that the defence put forward by (. Ontanseau proved the animue furandi to demronstration. In answer to the hundreds of spcoific instances adduced, the defendant had positively sworn that he had taken the mean. ings, &c., from other dictionaries, some of which were even not in existence at the time of his writing his US. In Pix or seven only of these instances had he admitted having consulted the copyright dictionary of the plaintiff, whereas the exhibits showed incontestably that, as to all or most of the others, the words, senses, acceptatlons and examples must have been derived from Spiers's Xdvertlng to the recent decision of his Ronour in the case of "Jarrold v. Houlston" (21 Turies, 1,051), this was a sufficient proof of the animus furandi on which the Court would judge of the whole case. The allegation that the defendant had paid for 20 copies of the School Dictionary without having seen It was unwo;thy of belief. The watermark of 1852 was inconsistent with the affidavit of the defendant, that the US. waa completed In 1850, though the object of that statement was manifest sa shutting out the possibility of his having pirated the School Dictionuzry published in 1 or (as to the earlier part of his MS.) the octavo of 1849. As to any argument which might be founded on the defend. ant's work being a fair abridgment of the plaintifser dictionary, M. Contanseau had distinctly repudiated, by his affidavits any such idea, insisting on his own being a purely original composition. Moreover, apart from facts, the p,c. babllties of the case were all against the defendant. Dr. Spiers had based his work upon dictionaries exclusively French or exdusively English; he had employed numerous amanuenses, expended very large sums of money, had corresponded with some of the most eminent literary and sclentific men, who had supplied him with material for his work, and this work had occupied him for 15 years, during which time he had devoted himself exclusively to it, giving up all the emoluments of his private profession. The enormous labour of his work was best shown by the appearance of his MS. On the other hand, the defendanthad, as he alleged, consulteid not only single dictionaries, hut these of the two languages to the amount of some 12cr 14, mcet of thema, accordingto his own admission, being utterly deficient for the purposes for which they were intended. Accordig to theopinion expressed by MM. Brasseur and Delille, both competent judges, this mode of composing a new and original work would tend to endlesa confusion and an indefinite exctension of labour and time. No amanuensis hadbeen employed by the defendant. s MS. was written from beginning to end in his own hand on ruled paper in double columns, with little if any space between for alterations,I additions, or interlineations, which must necessarily be made from time to time had it been anything but a copy. Yet all this so-called original work he had completed in seven years, being during the whole of that period engaged not only in his professional duties at Addiscombe, nut also In the tuition of private pupi. If it was attempted to be urged that the MS. had been rewritten, that would necessarily have entailed double labour andmore time. But there was no such pretence in te affidavits, and the watermark still remained unexplained. Moreover, as to very many of the dictionaries alleged to have been used by him, he had been obliged to admit that ey were not in his possession, but had been borrowed from the library of Addiscombe College. Was this the mode In which a lexicographer would set about the composition of an original work? The whole defence set up by M Contansean was dishonest and unscrupulous ; and though, of course, Messrs. Longman stood acquitted of any, if the sligbtest, idea of the defendaint's work havinzg been a piracy when they agreed to pubiish it, they had thoight proper, In a somewhat chivalrous way, to adopt and tale upon themselves the responsibility of the defence; and, that being so, the plaintiff was entitled to insist against them, as well as against ,. Contansegau, on the decree asked for by the bill. Mr. ROLT, Mr. WILLCOCE, and Mfr. CoiB, on behalf of the defendants, insisted that there had been no unfair use made by 1. Contansean of the plaintiff's work, but that each had special characteristics. The ver nature of the work-namely, a dictionary-made it proba.ble that there would be a general resemblance to other preceding dictionaries, and a comparison of the dictionaries of Dr. Spiers and of M. Contanseau would show that there had been no nf ringement. . Contanseau had employed upon his work his own original power and knowledge of languae, and his mode of tuition. Jt was this which gave originality to his works, exerolsing that species of instruction which Vs daily exhibited by other inteUeoual labourers-by the lawyer, who knew to what past of a oase to look for its Etsength or infirmity; or a physician, who knew to what pszt of the system he mnust direct his attention to discover the set of a disease. 3. Contansean bad employed his deliberate thought upon his dictionarie, and, although there might be identity even in errors an omissions, yet; in point of klw, there wes no infringemezt. An abridgnent Ws not considered legally a piracy, it was deemed to be an original work-a. new book, which could be only rued by a marn of learning and judgment. Whatever Contrtaeau had copled he had improved. As to the injunction, the equitable jurisdiction was only assumed to make effectual the legal right which required protection not obtainable by mere damages. The defendant, however, denied that Dr. Spiera'sdictionaries were original works. They ware mereeomip ilations (as al dictionaries must more orleese) from previos works. It Contausean had pied izomn Dr. Splers spages he had only taken what the had found in other lexioographers The chAracteristics clle4 by Dr. Spiers as original were ridiculous. Assuming, however, the proper estimate of his work to be as high &a he had put it, the work itself would not be deemed to have tha pce of originality which the Court could pohtect by If thnere were errors in the plain a works which bad not been oopied it would be a strong ircumsance in the defendant's favour, no matter bow many he had copied, for, it showed there was nothing like that eil copying which smounted to pfiray. Mesers. Longan employed competent persons who did their best to detect and to avoid errors, and there could be no doubt that their high character was not in question in this discussion. In point of fact, the persons employed by Measrs. Longman had rejected numerous illustations of meanigs given by Dr. Spiers. The plaintiff had endeavourd to make a compound case of copyright, which he could not do. He could not say, " You have infringed my *opyright In the School Didionary," and then adduoe in support of that instances taken from the octvo. But, in fact, the work of IL Contanseau could never rivalthe larger dictionary of Dr. Spiers, and as to the &choot Dictionary, that was sold at a lower price than the defendant's, a eircs gtance which was certainly vrorthy of remark in considering the quzeston of Injunction. 7'he difficulty, moreover, of the Court ever arriving At any conclusion in the case of an infringement of copyright in a lextoographical dictionary was enormous, and rendered the jurisdiion a aost inconvenient, if not an Impossible one. The learned counsel further contended that the defendant was not only justified in coping (if he had done so), but was bonnd to consult the raot recent publications, and - IOD8og a5 he onployed hIs own thought and labour upon such eopy, oven if he should interleave the originel work and correct ashe went on, that would be egtimate. At all events, the Messrg Longmau, the publishers, had dons everything in their power to make the work perfect, by handing it over to their agent for that revisionwhich hadresultedln the many additions and improvements Ac to the question of the watermark, it resolved itself into a criticism on the affidavits of Mf. Contan- eanu, to whom, as being a forelgner, some consderation must be shown In respect of mere verbal criticism. Several authorities were cited to the Court in support of the propositions of law on both sides. Mr. CAIBtNs, in the course of his reply, observed that it would involve a moat lnconvenient theory for Mes. Longmuan, as publisher and as interetted in the copyright of numerous sCientific works, if the propodtions advanced by the defendanfte counsel as to what was and what was not servile copying were founded in law; but in this case the whole argument at the bar had been grounded on the assumption that the defendant had copied from Dr. Spiers, whereas, in answer to the hundreds of instances adduced, Contansean had stated on affidavit that he had not. The court sitting a It was, as jr aend jury, would dedde upon the facts, and the amount ofages to which Dr. Splers The VIcx-CnAmCXLIOh reserved his judgment, observing that In the event of his coming to a conclusion that there hadbeenanunfairuse of the plaintiff's works, the two questions of law as to the title would still remain to be reargued before himself and one or more of the common law law judges, according to the arrangement.

The plaintiffs are the asignees In bankruptcy of Mr. John Sloman, of Hull, commisdon agent and shipbroker, the defendant, Mr. H B. Sloman, is brother of the b;nkrupt, and the aion wm brought to recover the amount of oertan bills of exchange, the property of the bankrupt, which, It was Alleged, he had converted to bis own us It appeared that the bankrupt had carried on business very prosperouely up to 1855. In that year he met with heavy loame, and in May, 1856, his liabilities were about 3,0001. or 4,0001. above his assets. He then went abroad and remained untU a peition In bankruptcy was presented against him on the 23d of September, 1856. When he lefit England a Mr. Simpson, his managing clerk, remained In charbe of his business. The defendant, who had come over to this country shortly before, took An sative part in the minag&ment of the buiiness, andin the course of the month of June obtdned from Simpson the bills which formed the subject of tbe present action. The pl2altifli alleged that he was then well aware of the bankrupt's podtion, and that it was an arrangement between the two brothers to defeat the creditors. A letber written by the bank:upt from Hamburg to Simpson on the 29th of June stated he would be compelled to compromise with his creditors, directed Simpeon to-be very cautious as to what he wrote in any letters that would be copied into the letter book, and desired him to tear out the copies of those alludinR to the balanee of the cuah.book. The defence was that Dr. 81aman, who is a gentleman of good property, reddlng at Paris, and devoting himself to scientific pursuits, had made large advances to his brother, the bankrupt. In 1853 he advanced him l,OOOh, and in February, 1856, a further sum of 5001 after that, in conse- qence of a oommunication from his brother, he went to Wult and advanoed a further snm to close the account with John Sloman's bankers, Messrs. Pease and LiddelL At that time the books showed a balance, and Mr. John Sloman proceeded to Stettin to coDect a large sum which was due to him there, leaving Dr. Sloman In HulL From time to time Dr. Sloman made further advances, amonnting in all to 1,9001,; at length, finding remittances not coming, he directed Mr. Simpson to hand him over some bills at long dates, which form the subject of this action; discovering that the liabilities were larger than he expected, he procoeded to Hamburg and saw his brother; the explanations wvere so nsatisfactory that they quarrelled, and Dr. Sloman had not seen hisbrother since. Dr. Sloman was no party to any arrangement to defeat the creditors He had made large advances to carry on the business, and actually ad. vanced 6001 after the day on which it was alleged he knew of the act of bankruptcy. The bankrupt's debts, exclusive of the amount due to the defendant, did not exceed 2,0001, and the assignees had received about 4001. At the concludon of the defendant's examination, Lord Cu&PB= said be did not think the actlo- could be supported; it might be that Mr. John Sloman committed an act of bankruptcy in going abroad, but the defendant had no knowledgo of it, and bond ,fde made the advances, Verdict for the defendant. JONES AND OTHERS V. SWAYNE AND ANOTHER, Mr. Honyman was counsel for the plaintifE Mr. Wilde appeared for the defendants This action was brought to recover certain Danish and Russian bonds which had been converted by the defendants. They pleaded, among other pleas, that the plaintiffs had pernitted a Mr. LesUe to use the bonds as owner, and hold himself out as the owner of them. The plaintiffs are the trustees of the marriage settlement of Mr. and Mrs. Swettenharn, and in the early part of 1851 directed Mr. Leslie who had acted as their agent, to purchase 5,0001. of krusdn and Danish bonds, and Mr. Swettenham afterwards desired him to lodge them at Mesrs. Coutts'6. Hfe neglected to do so, and in the month of June banded them over to the defendants, Messrs. Swayne and Bovill, the engineers, who had applied to him for an advance. They pledged the bonds with Messrs. Johnson and Ifongden, who advanced 4.500 on them. The defendants had since become embarrased, and their estate was being wound ump under a deed of inspection. They had offered toallowv the phintiffs to prove under the deed, although they at first Mr. WILDE, for the defence, said that the defendants had no knowledge that the bonds were the property of the plaintiffs. They received them from Mr. Leslie among a number of other bonds. They had offered to consent to a verdict for money had and received. He submitted there was no evidence of any conversion, as the defendants had merely received the bonds from MIr. Leslie to take to the stockbroker to raise money on them. Lord CAMTPBELL was of opinion there was evidence of the propert a nd conversion. Verdict for the plaintiffs-Damages, 4,5001. MEYERS V. JONES.

This action was brought to recover compensation for injuries sustained by plaintiff through the negligence of def ndanV servant Thodefendantpaid 101 into court. The plaintiff is a young girl, 19 years of age. She lives with her parentsa, but worked as a dressmaker, employing two girls, and making about 25s. a-week. On the 18th of September she was passing by the defendant's premises, who is an artificial flower-mnaker in Wood-street, Cheapside, a pane of glas was knooked out, it fell on her, cut through her bonnet and olothes, and laid open her thigh. She was taken home, and hor clothes were found tobe saturated with blood. A medical man was called in, she was confined to bed for a fortnight; after the wound was healed she found that her eyesight was very much affected, and she could not apply herself to aWny work or read for more than five minutes, and had not been able to earn anything at her trade since the accident occurred, but the iniury would not be permanent. The medical man's bill was 11. Mr. JAMES addressed the jury for the defendant. He said the occurrence was the result of a mere accident, and contanded that the 101. paid into court was amply sufficient under the circumstances to compensate the plaintiff for the injury she bad sustained. Lord CAUPBELL said, the only question for the jury was whether 101. was enongh. Verdict for the plaintiff-Damages 251. in addition to 101. paid into court. BUSINESS OF THE COURT.

The defendants pleaded never Indebted, pyment, and a special plea to the effect that the contract under which the plain s claim aroeo was entered into with him by the comnpany, whiclis fdlly registered under the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 110, at the time he was a director; that, contrary to the provisions of the 29th sectlon of that A ct, he acted and voted as a director in the matter of the said contract, and that the same had nr"ver been submnitted to and confirmed, AS it ought to have been in order to acquire validity, by; general meeting of the said oompany. It Sppeaed that the paintiff was an early director of the companyin question, and tVat whilo he held thatoffice, and while he W in the chair, It was rosolved to appoint some person whose duty It should be to establish agencies and to p him by ommissi on the premiums thereat effected. When this resolution wa pased the plaintift quitted the chair and the room, and the remaining directors passed a resolution appointing him. Thi resolutn was made known to the plantiff, who acoepted the offer, and at the next meeting sated as chairman and signed the minutes of the preoedingmeeting. Subsequently the board resolved to substitute an annuity of 501. for this oorn. mission, to which the plaintiff asented; but It appearing that such a resolutioo was pronounced Illegal by counsel, the board declined to carry It out; and eventually, differene having arisen between the rmger and the plaintiff and oertain oomments having been made on his conduct in reference to a oertain policy which he had introduced, the Wlintiff resigned his conneldon with the company and roqht this action to recovor such amount of commission as he might be able to showr his title to under the original resolution, wthich had never been submitted to any general meeting.

IBcfore the C p CO-r%mqTnN-R 1 This insolvent, whese case was mentioned in The Tiswa a few dys since, ppeared today for his first hearing under EiB tin torprotection. Ir Dovse appeared for Mlessrs Landon and Moreland, tailors; MSr. Caaten for a nvumber of creditors at Guernsey; Mr. LAwrence tor varitous creditors at Chlswrick; and MIr Griffiths for Messrs. Dew and Weatherby, hosiers Several creditors opposed in person. Mr Sargood supported. Upon the case being called, Mr. SARGOOD said tbat, the Court having called his attention upon the last occasion to the description in the petition, he had inquired of the insolvent and fond that he was in hloly orders, although not sO described in the petition. AS the point would be raused by the opposing oounsel it was desired to take the opinion of the Court as to the vaiidity of the ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~peiin peiton TheCiElz CusrmsslooNxt said tho description was insufficient, but he was disinclined at all times to dismiss petitions, The case proceeded, and at a later stage the Commissioner intimated his intenbtion to sustain the pea tition. Mr. LAWRmzx E referred to an entry in the schedule which set forth that the insolvent had a remote interest in estates in Norfolk, producing 20,0001. per aanum, which would fall to him, provided his brother, the prosent Marquis Townshend, and his brother, Lord IRaynham, should die without male issue, and asked whether that statement was correct? The insolvent replied thal, from information he had received lately, he was inclined to believe he had no interest at all In the estate.

He had pledged some for 401., with which he paid the rent, and 601. had been paid into conrt on acount of the remaining portion. He had resided at Chiswick since November, 1856, and had paid some money to nearly all the tradesmen who had supplied him with goods while there.

LOIWDON AND E4ST2'B'.R ' COMJiN., Y. EXAM-INATION OF J. E. STEPfEMN. EDINBURGH, wED.NE;SDAY, The examination of this bankrupt was resamed to-day at 2 o'clock before Mr. Sheriff Hallard. The bankrapt was further examined by Mr. Young for the trustee and creditors. He deponed,-I was present at the meeting of the board of directors which was held on the 29th of September, 1S56. MIr. MorriavTs present as chairman of the directors on that occasion, The other directors were also present. The minute of that meeting contains the following pasge- "The chaitman having drawn the attentlon of the board to a remarl which had reently appeared iX 'Tbe Times' newspaper relstive to odvances made to lte director of joint-stook bank,, and specifiedthe circamstace under whichbe deemed they were justified Jn'having ought and reoei,ed asestance fron the bha. a simIlar statement vwn moae by Colonel Weogh In tespect to advance made to him and to the alank8ee Clay Company, and he stated his int3ntion of putting it i the bank early in Tovembes a sum atounning to about 15O,O0, and the manager having offered explanation lelaUve to the accounts of 3Ieerrs Noake, Chapman, Parstons, Letta-whar and-other comnmeiclal accounts, and having stated the amount o eacb, theme were approved and the following reoltutlon wa passed:-'Resolve that for the rotors no sum be advanced to any director of the bank without awscrty of the sene nat,uc and extent as wuldbe equredrosnany~onsiten,and that should smy divose bsIndbtd i th su ofC5V0 o frihrl~oradvances Mr. Yo: ng.-It aful ea\s2o -to Ohave stood originally "faol boar," bt "ull" bloted ut, nd Weekly" wr"itten Bankrupt explained that the minute.book now shown was the scroll minute-book, from wbich the clean minutebook was copied; tho minute being read over at the close of each sederunt and at the beginning of the next5 thus re. ceiving the sanction of two meetings. He further deponed,I remember that upon the 25th of November, 1856, two bills of Colonel wuagh's, for 4,0001., each were dist counted at the bank, and the amount placed to Colonel Waugh's credit. Agai, on the 30th of December of the same year, two bills, of 10,0001. eacb, by Colonel Waugh were discounted, and the amount placed to his credit in tbe same manner. At the dates when these four bills were discounted Colonel Waugh was indebted to the bank in a large amount-ccrtainly much exceeding 5,0001. These discounts were made without the sanction' of the weekly board, but with the sanction of one of the directors. The sanction required by the minute was not formally obtained, but the subject was brought before the diretors, and it was considered advisable to discount these bills. Interrosate d.-Have you any explanation to Ive why thbvras conevwithout bringing the matter before tveweekliy board, in the face of the minute of the 29th of September? Deponea-I have no explanation to give, except that it vas impossible to stop the account of Colonel Waugh sud. denly. The director who sanctioned these discounts to the extent of 20,0001. on the 30th of December, 1856, was Mr. lAttey, my partner in the watchmaking business. The director who passed the discounts of 8,0001. on the 25th of November preceding was Colonel Chadwick, who had no connexion with me ia business. Colonel Chadwick was a colonel in the East India Company's service. He is about 60 years of age. He is not paralytic-certanly not when I saw him last, and is not so to my knowledge. Mr. Young.-My information is that he is so. Bankrupt.-I beg to say that the "bills presented for discount book" was before the directors every day, and that each of them knew its contents, and had an opportunity of marlkng their disapprovaL Interrogated.-Was Colonel Waugh in the habit of leaving with you bills to be discounted as you might find that occasion required ? Depones.-He has done so. Interrogated.-And with a view to diminish the number of his bils was the system of borrowed notes introduced? Depones.-The system of borrowed notes was introduced in the case of Colonel Waugh, as well as in other cases, but not for the purpose of diminishing the number of bills for discount in the bank's books. Interrogated.-For what purpoze was that system intro. duced in his case ? Depones.-On one occasion he granted a borrowed note to cover a large balance standing at his debit. Interrogated.-To what occasion do you refer ? Depones.-OD the 27th of September, 1856, he gave a borrowead note for 68,0001. Intefrrlogdated,-Was that the amount of his bils which Depone;.-It was the amount of the bils which then fell due, and of his debit balance. Interrogated.-Theeffect of thetransaction, then, was that he paid the amount of his bills then duo with the borrowed noe Depones.-There were no bills for so large a sum as 68g0001. It was to cover the amount of his debit balance and bills. Mr. Young put the question agaiu, saying,-You should know all Colonel Waugh's transactions with the bank inti. matey, The Bankrupt.-No, I do not. Mr. Young.-You should. You were manager for his creditor, the bank. The Bankrupt.-The 68,0001. was the amount of thewvhole balance due by him, including his draughts. The amount of his debit at that date was 68,0001., and the amount of his borrowed note was set against iL In reality he remained debtor to the bank for the same sum as before. - Interrogated.-Was this the first occasion on which he granted a " borrcwed note?" Depones.-No. The four borrowed notes referred to In my deposition yesterday were prior in date to the borrowed note for 68,0001., and were grantod in the same way and for the same purpose. A weekly balance-sheet wa laid before the directors at their weekly meetings. Interrogated.-Did these weekly balances show the real amount o the dekt due by Colonel Waugh to the bank from time to time, or only the balances due after deductin the amount of borrowed notes which he had granted ani of bUls which had boen discounted, and which bad not be. come due? Depones.-It showed merely the balance due by him on his current account. 1nterrogated.-In the current account to whic& vou refer were the bills not yet due and the borroired notesstdan g at his credit ? Depones-They were. The weekly balance-sheet is containedinabook whichisnow exhibitedtome Thatbookisnot onein which thenames of thecustomers occur, butshows the amount of every description of account, without giving the partlculars or the customers' names. There was another book kept, called weekly abstract of balances, in which the customers' names are entered ia alphabetlcal order. This book shows the balance due to or 'by each customer on his current account with the bank from time to time. The customers' liabilities to the bank upon discounted bills not yet due, or upon borrowed notes eranted by the customer, do not appear in this last-mentioned book, but mnay be ascertained by reference to other books. The banlkrpt was then questioned as to how far the accounts of Colonel Waugh were shown in the weekly abstract of the balances BankruptL-This does not show his actal transactions with the bank. Mr. YOUJG.-I am perfectly aware of that. On the 30th of February Colonel Waugh appears debtor to the bank for the sum of 3s. Gd. Is that the sum brought out against him after giving him credit for the amount of any borrowed note which is granted? Bankrupt.-The borrowed note was given to write off his debit balance. Ne further deponed:-The total amount shown as dueto or by any customer is ascertainedafter giving him credit for the amount of any borrowed notes granted by him eand the bills discounted by him but not then due, the liabilities on borrowed notes and discounted notes being shown in the weekly balance book first referred to. The real amount of the debt of any customer may be ascertained by reference to the current sacount books, .the advances book, and the promissorynotes discounted book. Being shown page 48 of the book, containing weekly abstract of balances in which the oustomers' names appear, and his attention being called to the dates 7th, 14th, 23d, and 31st of March, 1857, and 2d of April, and to the entries against Colonel Waugh's name, Depones.-It appears from the passage now ehown to me that t lonel Waugh's current account with the bank was then closed with a "lance of 3s. dd. against him. This book also shows that throughout the month immediately preceding and part of January the amount at his debit on current account was the same. I see that on the 10th of January, 1857, the balance at his debit was 38,9331. Se. 8d This balance of 3s. 6d. at the debit of Colonel Waugh, as already mentioned, is accounted for by the fact that Colonel Waugni's current account was finally closed on the 16th of anuary, 1857, by the discount of his promissory note for 52,9621., which note in the bills presented for discount-book I see isentered and inLitialed by one of the directors, Captain Interrogated.-Was the discount of the 52, 9621. sanctloned by the weekly board .9 Depones.-It was not. It did not form a fresh advanoe. Mr. Young.-That sum never was paid. Bankrupt.-I suppose not. No, it never was paid. Captain Fendell, by whom it was sanctioned, occasionally asome bills of his own discounted at the bank. They were to a large amount. Being now shown a letter from Colonel Waugh, and appearing to be dated 5th of January, 1856, depones:-That is a letter I received from him at that dat. It is as follo Ws "Mxy dear 8r,-I understnd more bills have become due. I shall be at the bank at hit-psmt 51 o'clock on uIesday the Stb, and ishl resl Obliged by i our having other bill ready for my sIgnature, ore reipt stamp, se I have before signed, thereby doln awaywith the necessity of so many bills. 1 had better signu fflcient to cover up till February-what mqa be fallilng due till then." Iuterrogated.-Had you blls or borrowed notes ready for his signature on the 8th, and did Colonel Waugh come and sign them ? Depones,-I see a promissory note signed by him on that date for 30,0001., which promissory note was laid before the weekly board in the usual wa-. A list of bills discounted and advances made was usually aid before the weekly board. Being shown the minute book of the directors, depones :-It does not appear from the minutes that the said promissory note was laid before the weekly board, or that a list of bills discounted, with the partie? names, wes laid before the said board. On further interrogationdepones :-Colonel Waugh fled tho country, to the best of mny knowledge, in April last. bIntehrgated.-To what amount was he indebted to the Depones.-The amount shown by the accountant as the debt of Colonel Waugh to the bank at that date war 243,0001. Interrogated.-Did you stil remain manager of the bank after Colonel Waugh Rfed? Deponcs.-I did. I have no knowledge of when he fled, but I reinaied manager of the bank tll the llth of ApriL Interrogated.-What was the paid-up capital of the bank? Mr. Clark (for the banL-rut).-Do you wish to go into the whole history of the bank ? Mr. Young.-Yes, so far as I competently can, Mr. Clark.-I do not so much object to the pLrtleular question as to the general line of examination. fe have only here to do with the affairs of the bankrnpt a lid not with the history of the bank. The line of exaninatio u indicatedpointsto a generalinquiryinto tho sff of tbe ban,, WDo, its paid-up capitsl being as I believe 230,0001, advanced within a mere trifle of that sum to one customer. Is that not, then, a prper inquiry ? The Bankrupt.-I beg your pardon- Mr. Young.-I a assuming, not stating, the fact that you did so. We have got how much Colonel Waugh was indebted to the bank, and I now want to ascertain how much the capital of the bank was. Mr. Clark.-Colonel Waugh was a debtor of the bank, no doubt, but that doesuot affeot the statement of the bankrupfs affis. The SEiRxrF'.-Wo cmn only here inqguire Into anything which may tend to increase or diminish dividend. Mr. Young.-I apprehend we have to inquire into a great deal more. May we not inquire, also, into the conduct of the bankrupt? The SE115IF.-The moral conduct of the bankrupt is no doubt some times attempted to be made the subject of in. quiry here, but we have always objected to that Eummanily. lr. Young.-It is surely a proper inquiry as to whether there has bceen reckless expenditure. The 1 SHE5IS-.-Th&t ma be; hut the main question is, how far does thigo to diminish or makedividend? 3ir. Clrk.-I do not understand how you can mske the management of the bank a competet subject of inquiry here. The SHiRns.-I shill be obliged to Mr. Young if he will explaia the grounds on which he wishes the question put. Mr. Young.-I think there are very obvious reasons for putting the quedion. The bankrupt was manager of the nk; he was intrused with the administration of its funds -I do not say without any control, but still o intrusted to a large extent. He became bankupt, and is indebted to the bank for A lage amount. He nay be indebted to the bank onhis own private account or he may be lndehted to them ado not say he is) for dhe manner in which he managed I their business-for his recklessly expending their ca pital- for having given it away to others; or, it may be, having a sisted others to embezzle it-for I am entitled to put it in that way. Mr. clark.-Are you entitled to ask the defender to criminate himself ? Mr. Young.-The bankrupt has the privilege of declining to answer any question that he thinks will do so. The SHnRIF.-That was what I wanted to bring outnmely, how far you were laying the foundation for a criminal Inquiry, because If it takes that ape it must do I so under the guarantee which the law provides for these Icases. lir. Young.- E:verthing that is done is under guarantees v7hich the law provi esa Tho SHEUFF".-He may be warnea specialy against answering questionS tending to criminate himself, Mr. Young.-Whenever I come to questions the answer to which, in the opinion of the bankrupt, is calculated to criminate him, he may decline to answer. If the bankrupt or his advisers think his answer to the question I have put may tend to criminate himself, I sm willing to have his deposition entered on the record that he declines to answer upon that ground. The SsmTrFF.-That Is in antidcpation of what nay come hereafter; butjust now I sin satisfied that the question should be put, because I do think in some view of it it is a gnestion o how thedividendmay be increasedordiminished. How the dividend may be affected I do not at present distinctly see, but I do not think that ab initio I am entitled to stop the question from being put. Mr. Young.-For anything that I know, 3fr. Stephens may be able to show that this was all fair and honest I banking, though it resulted unfortunately. We know that I even very honest osnkine may result very unfortunately, but theresultmay, onthe other hand, be different. It does not appear at this moment whether it is the one or the other, for he has never been chuaged with anything. The queston I put may affect the clim of the bank, and surely nothing can be more important than this on a question as ! to whether the bankupt shall be entitled to discharge or to protection from the CourL Such questions can only be judged of by referenoe to his deposition. The SHn'.-Here our f unctions are more ministerial than in England. It seems to me quite possible thatthe way in which the bankrupt may have managed the business of the bank may affect the claim against him, and on that ground I allow the question to be put. Mr. Clark.-Does that decision refer to any question as to the management of the bank ? The SmniUa-.-It is only on the question that has been put. | The Bankrapt.-The paid-up capital of the bank was I 251,04 I was the manger of the bank from it3 institution. 1 was the owner of some heritable property in St Janmees-laoe, London. It consisted of a bouse and stable, o. 17 of that street. I bought tho house and stable separately. I bought the house in 1853, and it cost me, with the improvements I made upon it in that year, 5,5001. I purchased the stable in September, 1 1854, at price of 1,6071. 3g. 4d., making the total amount paid for house bad stable 7,1071. 3s. 4d. I was also proprietor of a house at Twickenham, called Gothic-lodge. I acquired that property on the 29th of November, 1855. I subsequently purchased some adjacent cottages which I turned into oices, and the total amount which I expended on said propert up to the 18th of July, 185( was 3,1861. 12, d. The property was at the time of the purchase in very bad repair. I paid the bnuder's account for repairs, additions, and improvements snce I acquired the IProperty, amounting to 3.2361. 13s. I paid that account on. the 18th of December, 1856. I wil hand over the said account to the trustee. I had two or three acres of ground belonging to this property, and included in the purchase. The total cost of this property at Twickenham was 6,423. te 10d. I was married on the 30th of September, I&185. to Adaughter of Mr. MAorris, who was chairman of the directors of the London and Eastern Bank. Interrogated.-At what hour were you married? Question objected to, but allowed, as it might affect the question of dividend. Depones.-Abont 11 o'lock forenoon. On the 27th of September, 1856, I had money in the London and Eastezu Bank, on current account, and I had money on deposit also. On the morning of the27th of September I had at my credlit, as floating balance, the sum of 15.916Z. That includes what I had upon deposits as well as what I had upon current account. That was not a mere credit which I had with the bank, but represented actual money which the bank had belonging to me. On the occasion of my marriage a settlement was executed, to which my intended wife and fatherin-law and myself, and certain marriage trustees, were par. ties. The result wa that I was to settle 16,OOOL on my intendled wife, eLnd mny father-in-law was to settle 4,0001, inteng 20,0001., which sum was to be paid over to the trastees. The settlement was executed on the date it bears,29th of September, 1856. The said settlement bears in substance that I was to pay and had paid the sam of 4,0001. to Mr. J. C. Morris, my father-in-law, and that he was to grant, and had granted, a mortgage in favour of thu mariag tustesover his property in Wales for the sumarof 8,0001.eand thatI Iwas to deposit, and had deposited, in the Eastern Bak in the name of the marge trastees the sum of 12,0001. I was also to convey to the trstees my property at Twickenhim for behoof of myself and my wife during our joint lives and survivorship. Tho annual income from the 16,000. was to be paid by the trustees to my wife during the subh3stence of the marriage, and the anuuat income from the 4,0001. was to be paid to me during the marriage, unlees I should become bankrupt, in which case it also was to go to my wife. The survivor of the mnarriage was to have the whole Income, and on the death of the survivor the money was to be paid to the children. On the 27th of September, 1856, I drew from the bank the sum of 12,0001. 1 placed It on the same day to a deposit account in the bank to the name of Henry Morris and others, the marriage tstees. On the 29th of September I drew from my account the further sum of 4,0001., and gave to Mr. J. C. Morris a check for the sum, which was paid that day. I drew both these sums, and applied them aS stated in anticipation of the marriage settlement referred to, and I thereby implemented my part in the money provisions of the said settlement. I believe the trustees got the deposit recei t for the 12,0001. I am still proprietor of the house and stable in St. James's-plaoe. There is a m,ortgag to the marriao trustees upon that the 2th ofSepteber, 856.e mortgage is dated Interrogated.-Having depositod 12,0001. In the name of the trustees on the 27th of September, how did you come to graut them a mortgage for 7,0001. over your property on the Depones.-They lent me that sum on mortgage. I got a check for that amount from them, and placed it to my credit with the bank. There was thus left only 5,00Ol. in the hands of the trustee. Interrogated.-Do you know what has become of the remaining 5,0001. Depones.-Of that 5,0001. 1,0001 was lent on the 3d of October, 1S8, to Mr. Morris on additional mortgage over his Welsh property ; 2,0001. was paid on the 29th of Sep. tember to Mr. Morris As the price of Canadian debentures, whi the trustees bought from him. These debentureshad previously been deposited by Mr. Morriswith the bank "for safe custody," and on the 29th of September were ta4en up by Mr. Morris and handed to me on receiving the 2,0001. On the 31st of October, as far as I remember, 1,9904 was pd by the trus.tee for Turkish scrip, which rras bought the market, a I think, from a Mr. Henry Morris, a stockbroker. He is not the same person as the Henry Morrs before mentioned. Of the Canadian debentures, 1,205! 12s. 6d. worth was sold by roe trustees some m-o'nths aft-er-w-ards. Th whol of th-OF Turkish scriP was sold at the same time for 1,9951. These saes were made bY the trustee at may request, and the mnoney was invested in the trustees? names in prefernce Mdlalnd Pa4lway stock, which stock is still held by the trustees. They also hold the Caniadian debentures which were unsold, besdes the mdortgages over the Welsh and St. James's-placies properttee. At the date of my marriage Mr. J. C. Morris, my father-In-law, was inidebted to the hank to a large azsount. He was Indebted 12,0001. on aborrowed note, dated 24th April, 1856, besides a further sum of at least 2,000!. on his current account. The examination was adjourned at 6 o'clock till the following day (Thurdsay).
EXTESIVFS ROBBERY.- ZYe8terday afternoon, about a-quarter-pAst 1 o'clock, one of the corn mer. chants, Mr. Thompson, of Wakefield, was robbed of 3,000., iinnotes, checics, and other money, on the CornExchange, Manchester. The money had been lying on the ample table, where Mr. Thompson and his son were attending to budness, and was missed within a few minutes of the time It had been lat Been. Notice was given at the police-office, and Sergeant Shanley, an offlcer of the detective force, after some inquiries, determined to proceed by next train to LiverpooL A liPsle before 4 o'clock a telegraphic mess was received at Manchester from the officer, stating that he had taken the thief at Warrington junction, half-way to Liverpool, with the wholo of the money In his possession. The prioner will he brought up before the magistrates for examination this day.

0OUR2 OF COMMON COUNCIL. Yesterday a Court was held for the despatch of publil businees. SI ERY HAVELOCIC. Alderman HALE rose for the purpose of briDging for. ward the following motion - *"That thefreedoca of thls city, with a sword of the vanef t beprented to aoreGenerda tir Henry Havelock, Birt, if test. mDa7 of the skMi andbvery 5isplayed by him In relieving CararMe and Lucknow, and for his berol omndet soommmndat of the brave troops placed under bim in the Et Indle Mr. C.

Mr. REED said he had giVen verbal notice to one of the officals in tho Town Clarks-offioo of his intention to submit a motion to the Court with respect to the presentation of thefreedom of the city to Sir Henry Havelok Suab quently to that Mr. Alderan HAle had given written notice of a motion to the same effeot. He wished, therefore, to know from the Lord Mayor whether as a matter of pri. vilege, his own ought not to take precedenoo of the worthy alderman'a motion. Tho LORD MAYOR sad that upon making inquiry of the Town Clerk, he was informed that it was neoesary to give written notice. Alderman TFAri was about to prooeed with his motion, when he was antlicpated by Mr. DE JZxsxY, who aid that he himself, a weU a great many other members of the Court, were of opinion that the motion was sabmitted rather too early. (lear, Aldernan HtLE.-If that is the feeling of the Court I will cheerfully postpone my motion tiU the beginning of the year. The motion was postponed amcordingly. ST. PAUL'S CffUICEYARD. The Court was occupied for several hours In discuming the contents of a report from the Improvement Committee, recommending that a portion of the vacant apace at the south-east oorner of St. Paul's Churchyard should be let for building purposes, and aother prtionleft acant, to as not to impede a fNll'vnewofbthe oafhedralI The speeches of yesterday were arsepetion of those made apon two reoent occasions, and which have already appearedInour colrmn. On one of those occasions theCourtwre hastily brokenxup, and on the other counted out. The report of the committee, of which hlr. Deputy Bowers LchairSman, was yesterday adopt ed by an overwhelming majosity, POOR. WIDOWS OF FREMES. 1r. Deputy BARNARD moved,- *Tha tibe cm of £600 be given by this Coun in aid of the fund sdins from the gits of penons on their admion to the fteedom of this city ynnua dtributed by the Chamberlainon St. Thoa'sday tothoPoorwldowsoftreemen: and that It be refeed to theCam. ittee for General PurpoDes to giTe directions for the appropriation of the mane agreeaty to the former orden of this cart." Mfr. Deputy B OLT seconded the motion, which wascarried after an amendment proposed by Mr. Blake and seconded by Mr. Besley, to the effect that " 300i. " should be suibstituted for "flOOZ.," had been negatived. DETHLEHEM HOSPITAL. Mfr. WOOLTOPCTON presented a petition from the board of guardians of the West London UnJion relative to the ap. propriaton of Bethlehem Hospital as an asylum for the Lunatic poor of the city, and moved- " That the petition be referred to the City Lands Cotnrittee, to inquire and reort whether this corportion ba any juradirlon ia resPec to the goermment and appropriation of the fends of Bethil hem HospitaL" Mr. CAUSTON seconded the motion, which was carried. THE CONDION Or THE coALWHrPpkRS Op THE PORT OF LON'DON. Mr. CONNELL brought up the report of the committee to whom it was referred to examine the petition of the coalwhippers of the port of London for an inquir to be insti. tute by the corporation into their present deDlorable con. dition, and devise if possible some remedy thereof; failing in which, to join them in soliciting of the Government an immediate renewal of the BIll respecting the coalwhippers of the port of London. Mr. CONNELL said the committee whom he had the honour of ropresenting had taken a very deep interegt in the persons to whom the report referred. They had felt it their duty, as far as possible, to take care tEat the very humblest persons interested in the coal trade did not suffer from any oppression which it was in the power of legislation to infliLt. It had been felt that the Act for the protection of coalwhippers, which had been obtained by the corporation, had worked a great deal of gooi. It was the desire of the corporation that the Bill should be renewed, and when the matter was referred to A committee it was their general wish that they might be able to bring up a report advising the corporation to tako steps to remedy the grievances complained of. (Hear, hear.) The matter, however, had been taken u;p in Parliament, and the Government had decidedly set their face aginst it. Upon a representation f'rom the coalowners they felt that, as a free trade Government, they were not BustSfied in interfering between employers and employed. Te subject, however, was referred to a select committee of the House of Lords, and the following was an extract from their report:- in so fw asr their (the roeIwhlppesrr' complainuts reSer to the heod. ahps under which they suffer from contrctng their enragensests, ot recalvinc their wgeJ in a publio-houre-a Practice which cperates unfairy upn the", a invOlTiDg a deduction from their earnings for drink, and which Is morally injurious, as ec,,uraging habits o! intcxicaton4-the comnIdtee are of opinion that they are entitled to the consideration of ParlitameVt' They then proceeded to say that, as far as an Act of Parliament should at all interfere wlth the question of wages between employer and employed, that was a matter entirely their province. They advised that the system at present advocated and the office established by the coalowners should continne, and that no bill for the protection of the coalwhippers should be introduced Into the Legislature. Under these circumstances the committee felt it perfectly useless to recommend the corpor tion to take any steps to remedy the existing state of things.Ee conluded by moving, "That tho Court agree with the committee In their report."1 The motion was then carried unanimously. LU`-TIC ASYLUM FOR TImE cIY OF LONDON. Mr. CO' NNEL brought up the report of the Coal, Corn, and Finance Committee in relation to providing a lunatic asylum for the city of London, &c. It stated as follows : " We proceeded In the eference, and were attended hr the solicitor ard the rtct, who wer board at length on the subject, ,ad your committee, having carefuly oonaldered all the circumstances, are of opinion tbst, Assuming the providing accommodation for 200 patients to bs the basi of the caLculatton, the colt of the Proposed asylum including the pbmee of tbe ond, wbe bout a,tS000. We then Ooweede to consider out of what funds the expeDse ooull be ptde, and how thoese funds should be raised, and, having glven the subject our bet cnsbideration we ar ot opinion that the ost of eraetion of the proPOred aslnn, If erected at all, should be bya oounty rate, it beiug for the aODomnu0dation Of pauper lunatics." Mr. CONNELL. moved tbat the report be agreed to. Alderman C1JYBI said he was satisfied, after a careful examination of the whole rmatter, that it would make no appreciable diffornee to the rate,y ers whether the pauper lunatics were supported in an asyunm belonging to the oorporation or maintained as at present at private houses. They were not maintained at private houses without profi t to the owners. (Hear, hear.) He could undertake to say that the weekly cost to be paid by the parishes ought not much to exceed 9s. per week, and the difference between that sumn and the present charge would be sufficient to pay the interest and the gradual liquidation of the, cost of the asylum, (Hear, hear.) After ashort discussion the report was ordered to bo printed. JEMISE DISABILITIES, Mr. A N+DEBToN gave the following notice of motion: That this Court has heard with much pleasure that the Right Hon. Lord John RUoea, one of the mrmbers for thix city, has in the Houee of Commons renewed hli notice to move-' That tho House do 1s-olve Itself into a committoe to consider the oaths of Allegianc Supremacy, and Abjuration, and also to condder the dlablUtlos afecttiug Her Maetys Jewih subjects.' T hat, recognizing in the said notioe a proposal for extending the rights of ivi and religious Uberty so a large and niauentisl and moet losal body of Her Majesty's subjects, petitions be presented by this Court to both Houses or fPalament, praying that they will be pleoed no longer to withhold the passing of a law for the removal ofaU disabilittes affecting peiooz of the Jewish reUlgon, and thereby eable the Baron Lionel RothachUd, who ha been fire times returned to Par.

Mr. Alderman CunITT, chairman of the Police Commit_ tee, brought up a report recommending that the number of police-constables should be increased fom 67 to 587 for the ernulng year. The report was unanimously agreed to. TIm CrrY RAGGED SCHOOLS. Mr. ABRAHAIS presented a petition from the treasurers and committee of the City of London Ragged Schools, Long-alley, Bishopsgate, for pecuniary assistance. The petition was referred to the Coal, Corn, nd Finance Committee. Mr. J. E. SAUNDERS, jun,9 presented a petition from the board of guardias of the City of London union reative to the lunmtlc poor of the clty and the appropriation of Bethlehem Hospital as an aslum for them. The Court djourned.
M. HENRY LZSLZrES CHOIR. The reputation acquired by the body of dngers known td the pub cunder the above designation appears to be based on solid grounds. Mr. 1sliae, whose authority as a musical director is now recoguizod in more than ond place, ihows . determination to advance, with "inprovement" for his motto sooner than rest content with the laurels he and hig chora band have already earned. The first conoeit oE the third season, which took pla"e latni ht in. the Hanover-squar Rooms, afforded unquestionable evldenm~ that progrs hd been mde in the interlim; ad the entertainment was altogether oE a kind totalkeranlc with the highest elua ms perormanc in LUndon.

Penedkle The Puncral Anthm was writtea by order of the King and oompleted in the incredibly xhort period of five das. It was first performed on the evening of Saturday, Decembrr 17, 1737, at the oeremony of the Queen's funeral, in the Chapel of King Henry m ly To cziticize a work composed more tha 120 years ago by one of the Rreatest of musicians, and wrhich retains its place in the library of every one with knowledge to comprehend and inlina-. tion to revere the highest manifestations of art, would of course be presumptuous. Safmce it, though Handel has given birth to many things in which the evidences of inspiration (to say nothing of the igenious elabotatious of soience) are stroDger and more nuerns, and though it is. far from beiigwhat aw ther fond aidFrencthan impartial and nmuscafly.acomposhed b iogrpher, Victor 9Shce cher, insinuates* h ivlo Mzr' Rqiem (" in grandeutr of compoeitio, profudt of expression, beauty oe harmony and melody") the Aunrntem is worthy oC its composer, and cona ges of etraordinar merit-some few, indeed, which may be fitly sapos trophized as "sublime." It was originallv intended for voices, accompanied bh a string-orchestra, with oboes and organ; and to these Mr Leslie (or some other skilful hand) has dded bassoons, in a very effective manner, with. out interfering in the smnallest degree with the design of the author. A.short instrumental prelude leads -to a pa4betic chorus, " The ways of Zion do mourn," where the grand and striing effect given to each repetition of the words, " How are the mighty fallen !" must impress every attentive hearer. A fugued chorus, " She put on righteous. ness," follows in the same key' and here the master7 of connterpoint, in which Handel excelled most composers, and approached nearest to Bach, is oenspicuous. The subsequent quartet-" When the ear heard her then it blessed her"-is the piece most generally known of the entiret work, and so far as the melodious conduct of the fourvocal parts is woncerned, probably the most remarkable in the anthem. The sentence"How are the mighty fallen," is& then repeated in full chorus with much the same majesty of eapression and the same Uoldness of harmony that distinguish the slow introductions to some of the choruses of I'sradl in Egypt. "She delivered the poor that cried" is another chorus admirable alike for vlgour and simplicity, and developed to a greater length than ite predecessors; while the reiteration of " How are ths mightyfallen !" is, if possible, even more grand and im- reasiv than before. No muslcian can fail to be struck amazing effect of the progression on the words, hethat wras grt"-which is, indeed, truly Hiandelian, and therefore truly impressive. A quartet and chorus, " Thc righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance" (in the key of the opening-wrhich, for Handel, is perUnaciously adhered to) has some fine ponts, and is further remarkable for amore independent styleof secompanimentthan the composer has employed in any other part of his asthem. The next piece -I Her body is buried in peace; but her name livetli evermore"-is set to a chorus aJd solo quartet, which alter. nate with each other. Handel's power of conveying the utmost profundity of expression by means of progres. sions of harmony has rarely been demonstrated more wonderfully thanin the passages to which the first section of the above words is arranged. Read it in ecore, and it appears straightforward enough; but hear it, and the hand! of gemms, which can render smplicity subltme, becumes at onoe apperent. The intervening chorus, to which the other words are set, is appropriately jubilant, and derives ite chief effect from the marked coontrast it bears to the rest. " The people will tell of their (her) wisdom"-another srgreo of cboral harmony nce more reminds us of I.rac4,j an! leads to a chorus-" And the oongregation will shoL forth their (her) praise," which, while not a fugue, is still in the fugal style. A quartet. "They (she) shaU receive a glorious crown"-an ingenioas example of Yocal part writing- and a chorus, "The merciful goodness of the Lord"-ke e oeaingot the anthem, in the pathetic style-bring thhe wv ole to a conelusion. The execution of the Funcral .A4ntem, its novelty and its difficulties taken into consideration, was the greatest triumph hitherto achieved by Mr. Leslie's choir. There were occasionally feeble points, it is true- but the good, nay, the excellent so far predomninate lat unqnalifiec praise may be accorded. The band (A. Sainton, leader) was throughout efficient so far as the string instruments were concerned. The oboes were nearly always too loud, jealous, perhaps, of the. bassoons which Mr. Leslie had& introduced, nd desirous of enforcing their prior claim to be heard. The solo singing in the first two quartets was good, but in the third not so commendable. To conclude, the ant-Lem made a deep impression, and will doubUess be brought forward again. Both the now Dart-sons were sulg to perfection, and encored enthuiastieally. The first, by Mr. Henry Smart, "The Shepberd's farewell," is fresh, melodious, and wnittea as onlya mastercan, write. Mr.Ieslie's " Evening" (for male voices) was its worthy associate, since, though wholly dif. ferent in style, it betrayed equal marks of care and mudcianly feeling. The other encores were awarded to Converso's well-known madrigal, "When all alone," and Mendelssohn's part-song (for male voices) entitled" Eastern drinking song" -than which nothing more genial, spirited, and characteristo has been contributed to the Liedertafel of his country. These (as well as Mr. Benedict's charming serenade from The Gipsy's Warning, which, though encored, was not repeated, since it was p laced at the end of the concert) wsere performed in a style erdly to be excelled by the Cologne mahnner gcsnnvcrein itself, and without any of the trickery which is the least admilrable feature in the exhibitions of that singularly well-trained body of choristers. The room wasattended by a crowded and brilliaut audience, nd the concert afforded the utunost satisfaction. The second performance is announoed for the evening of the 22d inst. in St Martin's-halL " Life of Handel " page 192 t Cnompesed in tbe oollowing eaer, 1738.
