COUBT OF BANKRUPTCY, B, Arin~l 97. IN RE THE ROYAL BRTTYISFr RAv ., (Before3r.COmmum)n6OL-ROYD.) This W mSet ig for the examintion of the auditors and manager of the bank. Mr. Thomas Page, examined by Mr. I n ixTE, deposod to the manner in which tho accounts had been audited.- The substaie of Mr. Page's evidence may be given in a concise form :-He was appoiated auditor in 1853. hlr. Chndler wasbis oolleague. At the first meeting Mr. Chandler was not present, and Mr. Cratfurd gave explana. tioe as to the way of proceeding, which he wrota down. Mr. Craufurd the Accountant, was the only pers&n communicated with. About five hours sufficed for every half. yearlysaudit. Bilistotheamountof 95,0001. Craufardreprecento a an aeit. They had no means of knowing that thee consisted mainly of "paet-duebills." Hl had not the sligtest reason to suppose they were past-due bills. He everal times inquired If the ecurities were good, and CMaufrd's answers were very clear and satisfactory. The only doubt he expressed was about' wo small debts of 321. and 1&, and these he hoped the bank would recover. (A laugh.) On severil occadons these two very small debts were sferredto, but nothing was said about any other debts being bad or doubtfulL Cnufurd led him to believe that the securlties for the 95,0001. were good. Sinc the failure he had often 'wondered that none of the dirbeto:s or share. holders, knowing the nature of their audit, had Asked about securities. None *f the directors ever led him to doubt that they were good debtb, and Mr. Craufurd hAd never intimated tho slightest doubt of the security, and he (31. Page) always beleved that the item represented loans made by the bank on short paeiods on secaurities. Mr. Page proceede to give the same description of answer Sn es,pect to other debts and aets of the bank. The last half year' aocounts contained an item of 1,0001. owing by a MsrL.Goodridgeas far back as 1856 He had no reason to .uppose that these debts had been bad for years. In every eats, without exception, Craufurd rep-esented the assets as good. Mr. M'Gregor's debt was represented as a loan on mortge. No. I represented loans on mortgages of housee and lands, and which now turned out to be nothing of the sort. Hawkes and Mullinsdebt of 3,3071 and others were included in an item of good loans. That debt of 3dullns's was owing in 1853. Mr. Io=XLvXR.-You know that Mr. Mullins had been the solicitor to the bank, and was sid to be conveniently dead. (A laugh.) Mr. Page.-Yes ITs he not dead? [Mr. Linklater did not give any answer to this question. It may be observed, in the absence of that reply, that parties in the employ of the bank have stated that Mr. Mullins has been frequently seen since the time of his alleged decease and interment.] Mr. Page.-He had nothin to show that his debtformedpartof theloans representedas good. He had no notion that Humphrey Brown's overdrawn account of 37,5921., Cameron's of 3,0001., or Empson's of 8,0001 were in one Item as good assets. He had no notion that an item of 54,0491. includod 31,6631 sunk intho Welsh works. Mr. Page concluded by stating that he was greatly surprised when the bank stopped payment; that he had never been indebted to the b ; tbat he had derived no benefit from it beyond receiving some 401. for his services as auditor, and that if at any time the least suspicion had been excited it would have induced inquiry. Mr. T. Chandler exanined.-Was appointed auditor to the bank in January, 1850, and had continued thus to act to its close. M£r. Wilson was the auditor in place of lr. Pag up to 1853. Mr. Craufurd usully read items to them, which they ehecked off. Craufard read from papers in his band, and he and Mr. Wilson did not see thooe papers. Was auditor during the time Mfr. MGregor was dlrector. BEe (Mr. Chandler) became indebted to the bank in 1853, but he gave security. At the time of the stoppae of the bank he was itg debtor for about 8001. He lso borrowed. 1,300h of Mr. Cameron erly in 1854, and deposited shares of the bank as secArity. He borrowed the money of Mr. Cameron, because Cameron said the bank could not lend money on its own shares, but he could. lMlr. Cameron lent him the money by check on tho Royal British Bank. He had never in uired whether Mr. Cameron was or was not indebted to he bank. e was not awar until after the failure of the bank that Mr. Cameron had deposited his shares with the bankas security. Altogether lhe found, includingbiUs of Mr. Newman, which had been discounted for Was a debtor tothe bank upwards of 3,0001., and, exceptttesewuritieseheldbythe bank, hehadnomeansof payment. Newman was not a ruined man before he gave the bills. He might have told Mr. Newman that he would never be called upon for these bills. In the first instance the bill upon Newman was an accommodation bilL Referr'ng to a bill for 500., he had on that subject written a letter to Mr. Newman, containing an intimation that he (Mr. Chandler) would provide for the bill. After writing that letter he had urged the bank to make Mr. Newman the bll. That bill was one of the securities the bank 7d. Mlr. Newman might have written to the bank that he wa penniless, but he knew that he was not so. The bank bad not, however, got anything on account of the bilL He got 251. a-er as auditor, and his salary always went in reduction of his debt at the bank. An item consistinB of upwards of 89,0001 had been represented to him (Hr. handler) as current bills. He now found that they were past-due blls. He did not refer to the heading to s whether Mr. Craufurd was deceiving him or not. the paper held in his hand was Mr. Craufurd's statement. Had Limilarly audited accounts at a future period, which now proved to be past-due bill. He hbad not the slightest notion at the time that they were past-due bills. As to loans No. 1, they were certainy represented as current loans The statement In his hand, dated July, 1856, was in Mr. Cranfurd's own handwriting. He had no reason to sup. po these were past-due loans or other than good assets. obennin- to end Cranfurd always represented the assets as good, with the exoeption of the one of about 181. a laugh), and that he said would be got some day. Reierring to an ibm of 24,0001., he never thought it was for pastdue bills. Referring to an item, "t oans for short periods, 48,0001.," and one of 65,0001., he had no reason to suppose they meant other than current accounts. Never heard of Mr. Humphrey Brown having a drawing account at alL As regarded a uspense account of 36,0001., he was never aware that 31,0001. of It was on account of the Welsh works-money expended on those works. He never heazd of the Wesh works, notwithstanding the bank from first to last had expended 120,0001. on those works. Had never had any communication, except with Mr. Craufurd, on the subject of the audit. Neither Mr. Cameron or any director had ever spoken to him on the subject. He (Mr. Chandler) was a surgeon and brickmaker. (A laugh.) Mr. Mullins had told him that any schoolboy could audit the accounts, and that led to his becoming auditor. At first they picked out a few items, and finding they were correct he was less minute afterwards. Up to the time oE the stoppage of the bank he believed it to be quite solvent. Never heard a word of Humphrey Brown's, Gwynne's, and other debts. P.eferringto an item, "adjusting interest account," of 26,C OO. odd, there was noting in the books that would have led him to sUppose that 13,0001. of this arose from interest on the Welsh works. If he had seen the entry he probably would not have made any inquiry. He did not see an item of 7,0001. odd as interest on past-due bills. If he had that would have made him aware that the puastdue bills must be of enormons amount. He believed Mr. De Tape's debthad been reduced 8,0001., as the book purported, and not that the 8,0001 had been carried to another account. Never had any conversation 'Whatever with the directors of the bank. He (Mr. Chandler) was a director of the Wandle Waterorks CoD1- ny, of which MEr. Esdaile, Mr. Humphrey Brown, Mr. M'Oregor, and Mr. Baring were also directors. Mr. I s.s.R.-That was a company which borrowed some 17.0001. of the Royal British Bank ? Mr. Chandler.-It was. Md e L12"M&T=-The WandleWaterworks Company is defunct? Mr. Chandler.-It is about to wind-up. Mr. LInMLATzPR-What other company were you a director of in Connexion with the directors of the Royal British Bank? Mr. Chandler.-The Chartered Australian Land, Mining, Importing, and Relixing Company. (Laughter.) Mr. Eadaile was a director of this company. It is not wound-up becausethere is a quantity of land in Australia which be. long to them. It is in abeyance. (A laugh.) r LIMATL-Was there not another company-a brick and tile company ?-Yes. Mr. Baring was a director of this. Mr. LMKLTRx.-There wasthe Hot Muffin and Crumpet Quick Baldng and Punctual Delivery Company, was there not? (Great Laughter.) Mr. Chandler.-I don't remember this. (A laugh). There was an Irish Pest Company, of which M1r. M'Gregor andMr. Gwynne were directors I never saw the green ledger during my audit, and I never suspected that the directors, Mr. Cameron, aud other officers of the bank were its debtors. Mr. T. Craufurd, examined, said he was desirous of being examined. He had told them at a former examina- von sthat he was the accountant of the bank until he w appointed general manager on the 22d of July, 1856. He was introduced to Mr. Alderman Kennedy a few days before oh pe. f the bank and received the appointment. t ce wa the rtQ accountant, and _r. Napier was for some time the accountant of the bank. After he (M. Craufurd) became accountant he prepared the accounts flor the auditors, At alate meeting he had said that M1r. Cameron had ti,d him that he had had some conversation with Mr. Page, and explained to him his duties. Referring to items of past-due bills, June 30, 1855, 89,0001. This item was entitled " London hills, Nos. 4 and 5." The title was written by Mr. Cameron. He stated that these were London bills, and if the audlitors sad he (Mr. (Irau. furd) told them the bank held security, he should think he did so. The auditors could not suppose that they were pest-due bills. He did not volunteer the statement that they vere past-due bills, and he certainly did not suppose thatthn that theywerepst-duo bills. He didnotbeiev a th tme ha thy ereuner any inpressdon that they were -dutde bills. Mr. ~~~-~en did you nt believe that the td by the representations contained in Mr. Craufurd.-It was calculated to deceive them; there can be no doubt about that.

I cannot say that I mny have hmaginedthat at the time. .Yuhave already upon Youir oathi answered me that you did at the time believe the Auditorts w deeeived?-Yes. I 8ya touyou, therefore, believing that at the time you gave the explanation to the auditors they were mided by the items which youL reprseentod, to them, why did you not tell them that they were under a false impreson ?-I counld not have done so without referring to mY suparior. Then do I ulnderstand you t y that you oonseted to be made what you now know you were-the Tehicle of a falsehood 2-Not exactly that. Mr. Tgee said tome on one occasion, and I think It wag upo that One,-"After all, the audit in but a mnere farce." My wordis were, "1I perfectly agreewith you in its being a faire, but this is the mnode in which I am instructed to plue the accounts before you; if you are not satisfied you had better speak to Mr. Cameron;" But from beginning to 'end you said nothing to induce the auditors or either of thielm to belie,. that they were misled by the satements made before them ?-I did not. Mr. LUM LA&TE-ThIen I must repeat my question. Why did you consent to be made the vehicle Of a falsehood ? Mr. Craufard.-It was master and elerk, and I obeyed my instructions. r. I XL.AT -I have been spetking of June, 1855. ExaImiation, oontinued.-In June 185 I had a conversationwith AIderman Kennedy in T'okiealiouse-yard, and I believe in the early pat of Xy, 185,Ihad come to the conclusion that u_p to the amount of -upwards of 40,0001. there were bad bi included In the pastue bills amcount. At theo audit of accunts upW to the 80th of June, 1855, I intended the auditors to believe that the London bills No. 5 to the amount of 95,934. 2s. lid. were good assots of the bank, and they did not know anything to the contrary. Mr. LINEMLTM-Was it not intended that they should believe that they were good assetas Mr. Craufurd.-I say so. Mr. Laxkru.I-Hoave you any doubt about it ? Mr. Craufurd.-WO; the Impresaion on my mind un. doubtealy was so. Mr. ImunKATEF-Then, believing that the impression upon their mind at the time was that the item of 95.9341. 2B. 1li was a good asset of the bank; seeing thatup to that time you had yourself come to the conclsion that to the extent of 40,9000., at all events, it was worthies, I ask you agai, why did you not undeceive them? Mr. Craufurd.-Because Itold you I could not do so withoutInstrudtion from my superior; he knew themode in which it was done. It was his place to direct me if he thought it ought to be done. Mr. ITZIRM.-Were you not as accountant a servant of the company? Mr. Crauford.-I never took my instructions from any director. Mr. LIN3LATTEPt-Were you not a clerk or servant of the company, and not of the general manager ? Mr. Craufurd.-It ws not so in the Royal British Bank. Mr. LNXATMs-Did yoU suppose that Mr. Cameron was your master, and not the directora? Mr. Craufurd.-Most certainly. Mr. LWXanT M-Bnt you ad been in a bank before, Mr. Craufurd, had you not Mr. Craufurd.- I . Mr. Lnmr.. R.-Was not your appointment by the direct-ors? Mr. Craufard.-Yes; but It Ws introduced to Mr. Cameron and told that I should look to him, by Alderman Rennedy, on the first day. Mr. Ia I.A.TxPl-Do yoU mean that the directors gave up all control to Mr. Cameron to do S3 he pleased ? Mr. Craufurd.-The entire control. When I once spoke to the directors regarding the affairs of the bank mr. Cameron told me he would dismni me if ever I did it agamn without spealdngto him. That was in the -yer 1855. I find the past-due bills of the 31st of December, 1855 amount to 70,2781. 17s. 8d., and a very large proportion it was paid, but the auaitors believed it at the time to he a good asset, not ktnowing what It w. MIr. L .nAnsn-Now look to the accounts up to June, 1856, and say whether yOU do not fiAnd the amount of past. due hills at the chief office standing to the debit of that account tobe 69,7341. Os. 6d.? Mr. Crcufurd.-Yes. Ad thtotal of the past due bils at that time, 76 3931. 9d. ?-Yes. suppose you hadno doubt at the time that to the extent of about 50,0001. they were bad ?-50,0001. would, perhaps, more than cover the loss by past due bills. Could that fact have been udknown to the directors?The directors had the past-due bill book before them one or two days a-week. They must have known the state of the past-due bills. The astdue illbookwaslyin onthe directors' table day after day?-Certainly. very day .9-I should say every day in the week. And so kept that it would be impossible that they could be without the knowledge of the fact'.-The balance is extended in it. Were the directors aware how long the audit of these accounts occurred 7-They mnay have been informed by Mr. Cameron. ThZe never asked me any question. I never was in the board-room. I think you sy that you have no doubt whatever that the mode of statingthese London bils, No. 5, was adopted for the p pse of deceiving the auditors 7-I thinkso now, but Idi not think so at that time ; it did not strike' mae. You have told me you believed they were deceived at the tune ?-They were decelved so far as this, that they did not know them to be past-due bills; but if you assk me whether Cameron did not m the first instance make out the accounts in that way with the obvious intention of deceiving, that, I say, did not strike me Suppose the auditors had asked you in June, 1855 when the ton hat amountstandin to the debit of the Zondon bils, o watenty soud yu hvereferred them ?-To past-due bills, of course. Do I understand you to say they newer asked you ?-They never askedme about past-duebills or losse, or investments Did they not ask you whether they should find the London bills, No. 5 ?-Ido notthink they did; it wasnota question that thoy would put. Mr. IMaUATwnArc-Do you rem ember anhytn said about their having the right to i cthe ills the ee ivet Mr. Craufurd.-I have ated that Mr. Page seemed to consider on his first audit it was not a proper audit unless he saw the biUls and securities and looked at the accounts. I stated'this to Mr. Cameron, who told me that he had misconceived his duties- that he would have some conversation with him, which i6 Cameron subsequently told me he had had. I find that in June, 1855, the balance to the debit of account loansVPast due is 16,3291. 13S. ^ld., and that the Loan Account, c. 1I conisted Of advances on mortgages of houses in London, &c I think the words payable at three months were never used by me in laying them before the auditors. I have no doubt that in the loans past due the 1,0001. of Mrs. Goodrich was included. I didnot know the history of that transaction at that time. I did not know that tat 1,000O. had been borrowed by Mr. Mullin, the late solicitor to the banL-, in the name of mrs. Goodrich, for which he had debited her. I knew all this some time after Mr. Mu]lns's death, but I was not aware of it at the time. Mr. L INELAT .-Then you knew that that LOOO1 . was, or you believed it to be, a swindle on the part of Mr. Mul. lins? Mr. Craufurd.-Yes. And a dead loss to the bank ever since 1854 ?-Certainly. And, eRshaps, you will tell me why it was represented as an asset in June, 1855 and until Jute, 1856 7-The assets of the bank, as baning asset, Is everything that stands to the credit of the ccount. (Laughter.) Whether good or bad r-Tes. (Increaed laughter.) So that it represented four figures, 1,000, and therefore it was put to the crdit ?-It stood to the account; it was worth -what it was worth. That was worth nothing ?-So it appears now. But it was represented to the shareholders as worth l,0OO12-Clearly. And to the public who w ren unfortunate enough to become depositors?-Yes. But you represented it yourself as being worth 1,000. ?- In your a ecount.-In the ag ate And Tou represented that 1, an001. as set inthe bulk? -Yes, inthe=blk. Yes?-WDll, it ls posible. You know it is true.-I admit itif you say so. Do you no know it to be true -I do not recollect after ta.Itwa a mrae matter of forma sending the statement to the Gazdue; it was nmae out by a clerk.

TO TER EDITOB OF THE TrMtS, Sir,-Ad naeseam we hear of the degrade&rorI condition of the " lower orders." I have no doubt but the month of May will at Exeter-hall and St. Stepben's fumish us with fresh moans and groams on this everlasting subject. We shall again hear what the most eloquent of the educated classes cau bring forward to denounce and deplore in the character of that class which has no mission to preach to the rich and well-taught, which has little or nothing to do with the choice of thoge who make the laws which rule it. I am not going to say one word against any who are really in earnest to better the moral condition of the so-caled "lower orders." May God speed them in their work, but may He at the samo time bless them with a little more consistency I Who is so blind that he cannot see how every class is morally affected by the habits of the class immediately above it? If the higher steps of a staircase are very foul, you may clean your feet as you descend, but you will scarcely leave the last step uncontaminated. WVhy will not the orators of the platform and the Senate look straight before them and around them, ratherthanforeverbelookingdownwards3? Why make Africa and Cripplegate, foreign heathen and home moral destitution, the perpetual burden of the evangelizing, moraliring fOg, and forget the " squares," the "parks," the "villas," the Stock-Exchange, the casinos, the " turf," the Traviia ? A good deal is said and written about the Church of the upper classes wanting bold, eloquent preachers; would thoBe classes bear being told the truths that ought to tell on them had the Church its corps of Spurgeons to eloquently and perseveringly ring out each Sab bath those truths in their ears? I have no hesitation in avowing my conviction that one of the most poWerful clamses in this country -that class which does read and can observe-that class raised a fewc degrees above the labourer, but stiU a few degrees below what is caUled the middle class-marks, in a spirit which broods mischief, the hypocritical inconsitency which is for ever on the stoop to pity? patronize, and amend, but which shuns that view on its own level which would afford a wider and more urgent field for amendment. Let this system of attack on the depravity of those who have been reared to know no better-who, if they had known better, could have scarce survived their rearing-go on at the hands of those who have never known want, except through extravagance; who have had aU teaching, whose youth was protected from contamination, but who-adult-seek it, nay, openly seem to glory in the pursuit, and a day of reckoning -will come which wil shake our oocial system to its foundation. Row many a man has been transported for life for offences against property which are mere " orchard robbery" compared with the deliberate dis'nonest appropriation of the monoy of others which so distinguishes the titled, educated, sometimes religious rwindler of our present dayI I scarce know a crime now that does shock "society," although "srociety" sadly laments per platform the growth of crime among the lower orders. ln an age of the most wanton extravagance, proucll - live of ail tho moral deterioration money diffculty ever begets, we hear ceasseless lamentation over the extravagance of the classes who receive on Saturday what will hardly pay their maintenance up to the Fziday night!I I can recollect the time when the tailor's bilal of a gentleman was the thermometer to tell the world the height of his expenditure, as compared with the reality of what he had to spend. If I am to believe some who muust know, the money owing to milliners and dressmakers by "s ociety" betrays a state of things beyond all talor precedent. Yet there is a kreat cry for more of those " nice preachers who do, like dear Mr. M-, tell one such good home irtth,." Honest society, Sir, owed you much when some time since you denounced that open pollution of the stage which is again revived. We have now the aid of fluent evangelical bishops-men chosen, it is said, by the plous for their piety; we have our public men for ever acting the part of provincial lecturers, telling Us benighted rurals that " once open books to the eyes of our mechanics, and the intellectual will o'ercome the sensual; the paths of science will pierce through to forsake the paths of mere animal pleasure." There are no such congregations as those attracted to certain penitentiaries by their eloquent chaplaina; this I have witnessed, and witnessing I knew some around me who could pay tribute to " language " in tears on the Sunday, and yetreturn to "society," and speedily visit that scene where woman's ruin is made scenic, and death by consumption in a course of crime a thing for British ladies and their daughters to admire-of course, only for the sake of the "exquisite acting and musio !" What has education done here ? Strip the thing of all it gains from the actual scene, the perfection of the acting, the attraction of the music, the nature of the audience; let the same thing be acted at the penny theatre, the chief actress some poor wretch in whom it would not be acting, and oh, how would " society" mourn over this developement of depravity,-what a field for a " mission" or extra policeI I know nothing of Mr. Spurgeon; but this r do know,-I wish for this next merry month of May that we could exchange the old pouring forth of indignation and grief at the heathen and poor man's sins for declamation of a huncdred Spurgeon-power against the hypocrisy which mourns over the "motes" of the lower and ignorant, but dare not attack the "'beams" in the upper classes. Some of the giant societies will do well to look at the system On which their accounts are audited; this is due to the subscribers. All would do well to consider a future very different audit; this is due to the principles they profess. In an age when pure unadulterated humbug prevails, to the exclusion, or at least the suppression, of common honesty, good men must be content to be proved good, even at the hands of Messrs. Quilter and Ball, Coleman, or per the Linklater ordeal. Let "society," " good society," look to it,-the lower orders can endure the truth being told of their condition, but they wiU not endure to be for ever subject to a comparison with the educated, and treated as if to be ignorant was necessarily to be wicked-to be educated to be necessarily good. They may with difficulty pick their wYay through a book, but they have eyes to see and ears to hear. S. G. OSBORNE. April 25.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your Calcutta correspondent'a account of the travelling " chupattles" reaminds me of a similar occurrence that happened in 1818, verY shortly after the conclusion of the Pindaree war, and before tranquiDity had been thoroughly restored. At every village there suddenly arrived a messenger in hot haste, the bearer of a cocoanut, which he delivered to the " Potail," or head man, 'with instrue. tions to forward it istantly to the nearest hamlet, whence it was conveyed onwards in the same rapid and mysterious manner. About 23 of these nuts were brought to Sir John hMalcolm, then residing at 1,Ihow, but some time elapsed before he discovered any clue to their hidden meaning8 Bj some they were supposed to notify the establishment of British supremacy, while others looked forward to a general rising in favour of the vanquished Peishwah, Bajee'Rao. But no State secrets were conoealed beneath tihese " h,-d shells." A Brahmin at Jyepore had sent round to his disant acquaintances a number of cocoa nuts in. honour of.the birth of a son, and these, through te. stupidity of the messengers, were soon wandering over the face of the land on an errand of mystery. An immense tract of country was thus thrown into a state of dangerous excitement, from Jyepore in the north to the Deccan in the south, and from Guzerat to Bhopal; and, although no serious consequences ensued on that occasion, the incident shows how easily an agitation maybe created, owing to the peculiarly impulsive temperament of the natives and the extraordinary system of network which unites together every town, village, and hamlet throughout HIindostan. Your obedient servant. J. H.

BAAgQU?zA SUT'HAAfPTON TO LOAD Q7HhF -ruJsTZC. oOCKBOWN. The building knowniun Southampton' as the Audit-hall Was on Saturday eveniingthe scene of a banquet of a novel rAd Interesting character. The pubhli need. hardlybe xeminded thitlfor fn yea-s the present Lord Ohief Justioe of the Common Pleas was the representative in Parliament of the borough of Southsmpton, but perhaps it is not so generally recollected that some 16 years sincohe also fiUed the important'judicial office of its Recorder. The Chamber of Commerce of that town, anxious that this double connexion should mot pass away without some solemn and oeremonial kind word at parting, determined on. iunviting his Lordahi to a public dinner, and so pular was the suggestion that the list was speedily fiUed up with the names of men of all parties in politics. 'As a general rule the judges do not dine in publio except at the Mansion-house, but in this case the strict judicial etiquette was departed from, as not only did the Lord Chief Justice accept the initation of his old constitRents, but he was accomnpanied by Ir. Justice Williams and Mr. Baron BramwAell, who both bore earnest testimony to the fact that the popularity which had marked his Lordship's forensio and Parliamentar c^areer had aot~ deserted hin since his eleration to the bench. The dinner was got up by a committee of the Chamber of Commerce, the respected president of which, Mr. J. R. Stebbing, was the chairman of the evening. Among the company were men of all parties in the borough, and there were many present who, having strenuously opposed the learned Lord Chief Justice at his successive elections, now eagerly snatched at the opportunity of showing by the fervour of their demonstrations that, while they had differed from him as a politician, they had never ceased to eateem him as a man. There were present the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Mfr. Justice Williams, Mr. Baron Bramwell; the members for the borough, Messrs. Wilcox and Weguelin; the county members, Sir J. C. Jervoise, Hon. Mr. Dutton, and Captain Mangles; the High Shferiff of the county, Mesars. Lankester, Cooper, Croskey, and nearly all the members of the Chamber of. Commerce of Southampton, and a large number of the mosa respect. able and influential inhabitants of the town. Covers were laid for 80. On the removal of the cloth the CHA1LUaxI gave "t The Queen," to whom he said a recent interesting event gave an additional claim on the affections of her subjects. After "Prince Albert and therest of the Royal Family I came " Her Majesty's Ministers," which toast gave the Chairman tho opportunity of passing a warm eulogium on Lord Palmerston. The CHh&s-A then said,-I have now the gratificatioa of calling your attention to the toast of the evening, the health of the distinguished man in wheose honour we have collected this remarkable and -most agreeable publi¢ meeting. (Loud cheers.) Gentlenen, it must be matter of great pride and pleasure to a great commercial community like this to bethus enabled unifluenced by any unworthy motives, andavoiding all political or polemical discussion,todohonour to a member who hua served them well, and who has always shown a jealous care of their commercial and municipal interests. (Hear, hear.) One of the strongest reasons one of the greatest inducements, why thin meeting shou take place was the desire that one of the most distinguished men of the present day one who could vie in eloquence with the greatest orators wmich this country has ever produced, one who has retired to the position of one of the Chief Justices of Englaud, mi4ht not be said, politically speaking, to "die and make no sign." (Loud cheers.) As commercial men, you remember the benefits he has secured for this great commercial town, and you would not wish, I am sure, that he should pass into comparative solitude without receiving some proof that,whatever might be yourpolitical differences, they had not destroyed your sentiments of political or parsonal gatitude. (Cheer.) I am rejoiced, and I am sure you are rejoiced also, that, setting aside some difficulties which might have interposed to prevent the appearance of a judge at a public meeting his Lordship has thought fit to bo here to-day, and that, wi lie politics are rigoroisy excluded from our meeting, he can receive from us those warm and sincere expressions of gratitude which commeroal men are ailwvav ready to offer to repreaentatives who have served them weli (Loud cheers.) But neither, gentlemen, must we forget that our distZguished guest has served us in another ca city. Long before his Lordship accepted the distingud i offlce which he now fills, he commenced his judicialcareeras Recorder of Southampton, and he wiU not, I am sure, even now be displeased to hear thaTt wvhile filling that compara. tively insignificant office not one of his decisions was ever called in question. (Loud cheers.) I mention this because I thought-it wvould Ibe gratifying to hisLordship to have it recorded that his conduct as Recorder of Southampton had been as free from taint as I believe wil be hia career as one of the Chief Justices of England. (Great cheers.) Since then his brilliant career in the House of Commons is matter of history, but to that, as politics are excluded, I shall not more particularly allude. As a Chamber of Commerce simply we receive our distinguished guest, and to the members of that chamber I propose that we drink his good health with every mark of fervour and approbation. (Great cheering.) The LORD CIEw JurTroE then rose, and was received with loud and long-continued cheering. He said,-Mr. President and Gentlemen, I am at a loss, I assure you, for words to express the emotions I feel at this moment. To receive this compliment from the Chamber of Commerco of Southampton, a body so eminently qualiiied to represent the wealth, the intelligence, and the respectability of this great commnuity-to be by them thus received, thus entertained, and thus welcomed, in common with my honour. able colleagues, is indeed an honour and a happiness which it is difficult to find words properly to acknowledge. (Hear, hear.) And it is the more grateful to me to be thus received by you, because I see in this assemblage many gentlemen whose politics I know to differ from my own, whose support I could never have asked for, nor they have given, during the time I was a candidate for a seat in Parliament. To see these men united with the old and kind friends who have always supported me is an indication that, although I had not the happiness of representing the opinion03 of all my constituents, still I may entertain the hope that all are of opinion tbatthe representation of Southampton was not dishonoured while committed to my hands. (Loud and general cheerIng-) But, alas! gentlemen, aU good is more or less alloyed with something of bitternesssomething of regret; and while I feel that the honour you have done your late members this day is one of which both, but above allIindividuaUy, mustbe proud, because I cannot place my merits in comparison with those of your other effi. cient member, stil I cannot but feel a pang of regret when I reflect thatthisis the terminAtion of all connexionbetweenus (The speaker here paused, and appeared deeply moved, while the company cheered tremendously.) I cannot but feel that my political sun has set, and that, although your kind. ness may to some extent gild the evening which I see gathering round me as a political man ("no, no"), it cannot permit me to hope that that which was the pride and glory of my existence-the honour of representingyou in Parliament-ca ever again be mine. I cannot tell you, gentlemen, the inexpressible pang whieh that consciousness and that conviction cause to me at this moment. (Hear, hear.) To be, as I have said, your representative in Parliament, and to flU the high offioe of Attorney-General of England, was to me the summit of ambition. I desired nothmg further, and, if I could have had my will and way, that was the Position I should have filed to this hour, and never have daed to part with it while Ihad strength and energy to fulfil its duties. But, alas I man caunot frame is own destiny as he will and I becamo conscious that many years of active life, and five of the comind efots f fficia and Parliamentary labour,ha produced a certain amount of bodily wear anad tear., had told that certain warnings were not to be neglected, and that I should do wrong, and perhapsdetomycaitfr bc uselnessaltogether, if I did not ac-pt the highly nonourable office whic I now fill, and which iS far beyond aything I could have laid claim to. (Hlear, hear.) Rad I followed mY Own will I should stil be Attorney.General, and-may I add 1-gtill repre-sentative of Southampton (loudi cheers) ; but wise and anxious friends couLnselled me, and to their sober wisdom I have yielded. I should have preferredl still to toss on the stormy sea of political life, rather than to be navigating the smooth and tranquil waters in whic my nowr float,o and I can assure YOU from the bottom of m hert tat ne of the greatest of mny pangs is the sleverance Of that connexion with you which formed my greatest haPPiness (Cheers.) What do I not owe to this Place 1 EverY Step of my career has been influenced by my connexion with Southampton. It was here that, now some 16 Years ago, I first received a minor judicial office in the shape Of Your liecordership, anda it gives mne in. expressible satlsfc6ction -when T heakr our president say that, while holding that Office, jus tice dlid not suffer -n my hands. (Hear. hiear.) My ,Lira entrance into parl'ia. mnent was as memlier for Southamp~ton, and I am happy in remebering that while I remained in Parliament I rePresent-ad no other place. In every suba~enstpo my career YOU Met me 'with cordialty and ki_undn sess andf shal nt asiy orgt tatwhe oficaladvancement inter~~cese~urein Prlimen myPolitica ~ponents a geerou forearace,and troubla mnot me.

'They fuhmemanfully and fairly, and our contests, I trust, leave no unpleasat remembrances either ia them or inme (Cheers.) But, I have allowel myself too lone to be, u mindful of my excellent colleague. Alas ! that It mut say my quondam coUeague, who looks Younger and fresher than when, ten years snc, -we 9canvassed*th courts and alleys of your town together. But I forget, politics are excluded, the tragedy must be pIa edwith the part of Hamiet omitted, and -Punck Is nJoday, be. cause you must. not make him seak ; and yet howman pints are there upon which, efo re we Part for'ever should gladly say a word. (Loud cries of IIHear, hear") I should like to say a word in vindication of my own duct, if open to animadversion, and as it has often been animadverted on , but this I may say, that with no* aind then an exception, justice has been done my motives, even by those who differed from me in opinion ; and I am bound to admit that I reelved at the hands of opponents as well as of friends P. generous, Lberal, and noblo indulgenice for the 10 years during which I have been conuected with Southamnpton. During those 10 years what great events havetherenotpassedoverEnglandt Daringthattimnwe passed through one of the greateit wars ever known, and even if some faults were committed, and some shortcomings took place from which we must leiri:wisdom for the future, yet, on the other hand, British valour never shone more censpienously, nior was the honour of 'thi- British f[ag ever maore manpifioontly up'held.

I rejoice to think how gset a sh Soutbmpton must bear in any developmet of our trade.

And I believe that to the last moment of my exstencer happen toWme what may, when I look back on iny pt lfe ana past career, so far sS my public life is concerned the happiest and the brightest of my recolleotions will. be my association with thcommunity, with which I have been so intinately co nected, as being your representative in Parliament. an from which I have received innumerable acts of kind,es and courtesy.both from friends and foes.

It would ill become him to institute a compaison between the present judges and their predecessors, but this he might sy, that never was there a time when the 4udges were more devotedly anxious to fulfil the duties of their station honestly and feaS lessly. (Hear, hear.) He must add, that to him, as one of Her Majestys judges, it had been a source of infinite satisfaction to be a vitness ef the affectionate respect so sincerely and so beneficially shown to that eminent member of the judicial bench for whom this evening!s homage vasspecal intended. He also rejoiced at being a partaker in a Soutliampton festivity, for he had once been a Winchester boy, and he well remembered that a trip to Southampton was one of the pnost pleasing anticipations of his school da1y. (Cheers.) Since then it had always been a pleasure to ihu to come to Southampton, but peculiarly so on the occasion of his last visit; and although the Chief Justicewas present, he would tel him thai.it was mainly attributable to his having his Lordship for a coDellue.

He would be pardonedforsayingin his Lordship'spresencethat he had never had a colleague so free from affectation, so full of good humour, or whose wit was so calculated to relieve the minds of his brethren after a long and anxious day in court. It was therefore with the greatest pleasure that he foun'd himself permitted to take part in the present splendid ova. tion. (oad cheers.) Mr. Baron BnAzx , in answer to loud and repeated calls, said that his privilege, as one of the youngest of the judges, was to have his speeches generally made for him, and therefore ho spoke on that occasion without the slghtest premeditation. He attributed the kind reception of his name to the fact of his being one of the judges of the land, and also to his being the colleague-he was proud to add the friend-of their late distinguished representative. (Loud cheers.) To do his distinguished friend honour was the object of their meeting, and anything beyond that would, in h opinion, be out of place. (Cheers.) He need not remind them of his distinguished friend's qualities as an advocate or as a member of the House of Coommons, but he had now left both bar and senate, and his eloquence would no longer serve him. It was not dazzling brilliancy that would do the duty he had to perform, and if that brilliancy were his only quality he would be unfitted for bis new duties. But he (Baron Bramwell) ventured to prophesy for him on the bench a career as successful as that which he had thus terminated. (Hear, hear.) He thought the time would come when Southampton would have cause to be proud of th share she had had in maturing the intelligent b ter and eloquent legislator into the able and distinguished judge (Loud cheers.) After one or two toasts, Lord Chief Justice CocxitmURN proposed the toast cf "Success to the Chamber of Commerce." The PRESIT responded to the toast, and, the healths of the President, the Vice-President, and Secretary being drunk, the proceedings were brought to a conclusion shortly before mnidnight.
WHITWOBTH AND BEFIELD BIFLES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The Interesting account of certain experiments made at Hlythe with a rifle of Mr. Whitworth's construe. tion and one selectod from among those sent for the instruc, tion of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers at that establishment, although giving a fair account of what took Place, contains so much that is calculated to mislead the public that I am inducod to trouble you with a few remarks. The account in question does not state that, after carrying on experiments for between two and three years, entirely at the public expense, and without any control as to the amount of that expense, the direction in which the experi. inent should go, or any Interference of any sort, 3Mr. Whit. worth has just produced three weapons of sufficient length of barrel to form a rifle musket with a bayonet attached. Of thesw on only is said to bo made of iron; the others of OAst steel, bored out of the solid, and rifled with that accu. ray to which it is, perhaps, not too much to say that nobody in the world but Mr. Whitworth can at present attain. It may not be fair to allude to the cost of such a barrel as it may be true that when made in quantity they can bo produced as choaply as the barrel made at Enfield, Birmingham, or elsewhere. But it must bo borne in mind that against such a rifle barrel, made in sach a workshop as Whitworth's, possibly " trued" to the ten-thousandth of an inch, was tried a weapon, certainly selected as being apparently the best of alot of 8 or 10; but the whole cost of which, including lock, stock, &c., did not exceed 31. Further, that in Whitworth's rifle the pro. jectllo was made to fit withmathematical accuracy, windage at a miniimum; the powder selected as to quality and grain. In the other, the ordinary cartridge covered with the paper was used, the powder being the ordinary powder of the service. Again, the question is most unfairly stated when the rifle in question is, without explanation, called the "DEnafeld Rifle," because this gives the impression that the substitution of the Whitworth for the Enfield barrel necessitates the loss of the establishment at that place, whereas the trnth is that the whole of tho machinery, except that for rifling, would be available for Whitworth's-viz., for stocks, sights, bayonets, locks, &c.; and the change could be made in the riffing machinery for a much less cost than has been expended by Mr. Whitworth up to the present time. This supposes that Whitworth barrels can be made in the ordinary way. That the use of such a weapon as Witworth's at the Mala"off would have rendered the "rope mantlets" of small service is true, but, as the experiments supposed to be decisive were only made during the month of April, 1857, it is not very clear what this has to do with the argument. Can Mtr. Whitworth say he has been hindered, limitod, or interfere d with in his experiments ? In securing the services of Mr. Whitworth Lord Iardinge may have done good service, bat the object during the last two years and a-half has been to equip the army with a weapon superior to that possessed by their enemies. A generally received principle-oxpansive-was acted on, and 1nlield is simply answerable for the manufacture of weapons of a given length, carrying a given weight and diameter of ball. The trajectory of Whitworth's is lower than that of the Enfield,--& decided advantage in many respects, bat a part of this Is due to its form, being smaller indiameter, longer, and fired with an equal chargeof powder, thus rendering the "c omparison" more indefinite. Without questioning the superiority of the Whitworth barrel, it must be clear to every really impartial person tha' a trum comparison is still required with weapons made with equal skill and care-not only trials of accuracy, but on the question of fouling, loading, &c., after the superiority of Whitworth in accuracy has been agreed on. Let it not be thought that I am deirous of detracting from the merit of WXr. Whitworth, or supposng that the money has been umwisely given, but I do not think even he would agree to the proposition that the whole of our army ought to have remained unarmed until by laborious re- earch and patient experiment, wlth, an expenditure of, say, 15,0001., he had produced a result in April, 1857. ., ATYoar obedient servant.

The ptovincial branches of the chorus are nealy con. pletd, aud a list of the towns and districts-rom which the membeis have been sdectd is in cours of preparation. The muslc-boos have been especially coroWed for the festival, and some notion may be had of the quantity required for the thee days when it is stated that, allowing only one book for every two persons, they make a pile of between 70 and 80 feet high. The arrangements for .tha aocmmodtion . of the audience are in an advanced state of forwardness, and a plan of the stIll hs been issned. The central transepc is to be divided into two departments by an impassable barrier, with means of apprOach and general arrngements independent of each other. The total ar will comprise a spwe of 384 feet by 288, 'with sitfing room for 13,600; and this excusively of the galleries, which aro to hold 3,000 more The entire trnsept is distributed in blocks of xtalls, containing about 400 eacb, those on the north side being distinguished by single letters from A toT thoseon the south by double Iettes, AA to TT. The entraoe to the former WiM bo from the Sydenham, that to the latter from .the t Norwood approach to the Pace, through thesmaller.tranaepts. The central entranoe, cloe to the orchestra, will be monopolized by the musical performers, stewards, and other perqs ofcially employed. The stewards of the Sacred Harmonic Society, who have had considerable experience in the distitbution of croWded amemblies, are organizing a bdy of officers, whose duty it will be to attead, withplans in hand, and point out to visitors their respective seats, so * that nd trouble or confusion may arise. Railroad visitors are to enter the Palace by the staircases leading to the smaler transepto, north and iouth. The form and construction of the orchestra have been described. Although notioe has repeatedly been given that the lists are quite ful, applications to take part in the chorus eontinue to pour in daily nd hourly from all quarters. It is believed that the committee, if necessary, could obtin from 1,600 to 2,000 more voicea from the metropolis alone-a fact which says volumes for the Imoledge and practice of choral music niov existing in this country. The progres;s made of late years Is immense, and th example set by the Saicred Harmonio Society twilt be generally admitted, has bad some influence in laringing about so desiable a result,
CHsUOH-RsARS. TO TH BEDITOB 01 THE TME. Sir,-Not one of the propesais reoently made for settling the question of church-ratee appears to me to be deserving the namo of " a eomprombe" They are ail onesided. Those Ingeniou writers who think that by levying them under some other name they may be made sweet to the nostrils of Nonconformits wre lamentably in the dark as to keen perceptions of that body on. everypoint connected with this long and weary cortroversy. Nor do I think it at ail likely that in pishe where Dissenters have got rid of the tax altogether it wil be easy to induce them to re-.npose even a half rate forthe support of the fabric. This last proposal would be reasonable enough if every r6gious boady could have the use of the church alternately. If the suggestion of one of your witty correspondents had been adopted, and the ninhabited part of St. Paurs been offered to Mr. Spurgeon, then his congregation might have been fairly asked to pay their shre to sapport the building ; I have no doubt they would have done so willingly, and have provided their own benches and cushions to the bargain. Bnt we who oontend against church-rates say thi,-while the members of the Church of England have the exclusive pooseaton and use of these national temples, ihe nation at large has a right to expect that they, " the most numerous nd wealthy religious body existing," will at least take care that the churches be kept in repair and good preservation. If they lack the zeal and power to do this, then wesay they are no longer entitled to the exclusive possession which they now enjoy. Your well known liberality induces me to ask you to allow aDissenter to offer hiplan of accommodation, differing very much from schemes already proposed, but respectfully offered for the consideration of all who desire to put an end to the strife and iliwill engendered by these yearly oonfliits It is dmply this:- "Lhet a rate be levied in every parish, to be called as hero. tofore 'church-rate.' " Let the collector of this rate carry with him a book containing the names of the ratepayers and the sam each has to contribute. "Let every conscientious Dissenter who objects to pay to the EstablishedChurch write against the sum he pays the name of the place of worship he desires to support. " Then, when the rate is collected, let that portion taken from Dissenters be psidto their own chape4, in accordance with their individual wishes. " Let the Church have its own juast share-viz., all that is contributed by its own members," The advantage of this scheme over a pure voluntary rate isthis-that all the community would pay toward that which exists for the common good. The great evil which afflicts the Church now in aU parishes where arate has been refused is this-that a few liberal Churchmen have to tax themselves very heavily in support of the voluntary rate, while the mean and selfish part of the community, who share in all the advantages arising from the holy Influences:of public worship and instruction, pay nothing, give nothing to church or charity, but leave all to be done by the very men who, if relieved from this unfair burden, would double their donations to many of the benevolent and useful Institutions which need in. creased support to meet the growing wants of the age. A church-rate fairly levied upon all property, and fairly apportioned, as I have suggested, would be, I am sure, but a light impost on the community as a whole. Opposite to the house in which I am writing, Sir, stands the psaish church. On Sunday mornings when the bells strike up and the gates are thrown open, I note that the aged poor, the halt, and the blind are the earliest comers to God's House. I see them stop to look at the flowering shrubs, to read the text on the tombstone; I see them enter reverently and I know that to them the place is very dear, very sacred. You wil find them seated there, mostly in workhouse garb, long ere the more hasty fashionable arrivals fill the building as the service commences. I love the land and the people, Sir, which cares for its poor, and, although a Dissenter, I have no desire to see a day come when thisnation shall neglect to provide for "the poor man's church." But Churocmenmust learn to do us justice, and not forget that in districts where poor men have needed places of worship Dissenters have supplied that need, and are therefore entitled to consideration nd respect for what good they have done. The Nonconformist body has now grown too strong to submit to unjust imposts, or to be treated with contemptuous indifference. For the future it wil share largely m influencing the mind and the morals of the poople. Miust it ever do this iU a spirit of antagonism and warfare; or may not some means be devised to put an end to strife, and to allow all parties to work in harmony and with good wll? t I trust that they who have the settlement of this chrch-rate question may be enabled to answer as all good men would wish, Youxr, ha.

PROGRBSS OF NEW SOUH WALEs.-The annual retrospects of the progress of this colony during the year 1856, which are just coming to hand, show that favourable progress has been made in its principal resources. Constitutional government has been inaugurated, its finances are healthy, its social state and prospects are most satisfactory and its inhabitants contented and prosperous. The ony drawback has been the apprehension latterly entertained of a commercial crisis from excessive importations, but the general asoect of the export trade s^peaks most highly for its substantial positon, and gives the most encouraging antici. pations for the futnre. The annual revenue returns show au increase in 1856 over 1865 of 82,2378 5s. 4d., the totals being respectively 1,018,9281. Is. 4d. in 1855, and 1,101,1651. in 1856. Of the principal sources of revenue the Customs Ielded 421,7351. Os. 3& inl85, and 47L,4011. 3s. 6d. in 1856. The gold revenue in 1855 was 27,587. 12s. 7d., and in 1856 35,15&. Is. 6d.; the land revenue brought in from sales 269,934. 12s. 7d. in 1855, and 245,5557. 2s. 5d. ia 18566 from rents, &c., 58,3701. is. 3d. in 1855, and 63 1111. 13s.5d. in 1856. Notwvithstanding the nnfavourable state of the import markets credit continues good, aud according to our latest advices money is plentiful and the banks are doing business, but cannot procure sufficient good paper for discount. The low price of breadstmfik will enable the bulk of the community to lay out more money in articles of import, and we anticipate there will be.a considerable consumption durin- the next six months. It is most gra^ tifyingto report that every article of export is ridng in valus, aud that the settlers gonerally are in a most satifaac. tory oondition and have lage sums awaiting investments as the scarcity of laibourers prevents them. from increasing theirflocks and herds, or extendingtbeir agridultural opera. tions.-Ausfralian and z,ew Zemand Gazette.

Pablic schools, rbads, railways, an i n aomnnerce, a respectable table,of exports and im;ports, te their own tale, and bear witness to the energy and industry of the natives. Valparaiso, an open port, expoed to northers and heavy rollers, does a trade far exceeding that of Callao, putting the gpano oat of the iceount. It is the southern station of the Pacifio- Steam Navigation Company. An excellent coal has. been found and worked, and is used on board these boats. The mining capabilities of the conntry are in course of full development, and the agriculture is so far advanced that Chilian flour competes favourably with the beat American brands in the Australiat market. All this has not been without the aid of foreign capitaL On the contray, there are several British and French houses, of large means, at Vatparaiso, to which the native taste for Eurojmean articles of luxury and elegance offer excellent inducements. The woalthy residents import even such cumbrous articles es house furniture from abroad, while in the lighter matters of wearing apparel and jewelry there is, perhaps, nowhere a more lavish disregard of expense, and a greater taste for splendour, both of colours and material. The coasting traffic ws formerly done by small vessels, maby of whici sailed from the ports of the Ienited States, and carried on-a kind of xmuggang trade, something after the fashion of the opium trade in China-illegal, yet sanctioned by public opinion, and winked at by local authorities. The English coasting steamers, running from Valparaisoto Panama, and touching at the intermediate ports, have abridged this unlawful trade. These belong to an English company, and an upheld by a subsidy from the Chilian and Pervian Governments 'for carrying the mails, without which, indeed, it is said, they could not proceed, as the pasenger traffic - alone would not pay. There hbave been at various times ideas of running an American rival line at lower rates, with the view of opening up the American trade. Nothing of much consequence has probably been done. The development of our Californian and Mexican relations is work enough for one generation. Perfection is not to be found in human institutions, not even in Republics. The founts of Chilian justice are not very pure. We know of a lawsuit between two inercantile houses at Vallparaiso. 'When the day of trial was appointea each of the suitors deatched a courier with a good supply of gold, to be judidously expended by the lwyers aud agentsat the eapitul. The losing party hu always attii. buted the advorse decision of the Court to his meesengeres breakdown. Judicial purity is the very seal and samp of highly organized communities; and if we allow only a small share of truth to the rumonrs that constantly reach the ears of every man whose business brings him across the pith of official duty in our own country, we cannot be smrprisid at some considerable amount of hole-and-corner work in ChilLi..

The aggression of the civilized upon thie uncivilized, of thu active upon the lazy, of the enterprising upon the timid and cautious, is not a thing of yesterday, and was not begun by General Walker. England, France, Spain, Portugal, and HoUand have been filibustering for the last 400 years. The Spnish colonization of South America, and the French and nglish colonization of North Americ, and the Dutch occupation of tho Spice Islands, were all undertakings which, whatever the law of nations may say, were certainly not in accordance with the law of nature. Most of the great names of the Elizabethan era,-Drake, Hawldns, Frobisher, Raleigh, Essex, and others,-were the names of men whose greatest glories were reaped in enterprises which no diplomatist nowadays would attempt to justify. Their great talents and great virtues-their aterling simplicity of character and romantic daring, hide from our view the thousand d4rk spots which sullied most of their undertakings. One of the most popular of modern novelists has made tho Filli. busters of the 16th century the heroes of one of his most popular novels, and we venture to say few people have risen from the perual of it without feeling aU the better of being cheated into sympathy with the bold adventurers who three centuries ago fought, revelled, and plundered along the shores of the Spanish main. We may come down a good deal nearer our ownv time and find plenty of " historical parallels" for anybody who is fond of them, We should like to know whether every European settlement that has been plantedinE[indostahsznotbeenplantedb3tP ilbustera.Clive waS a Filibuster, and so was Warren I{astings,-and they were both none the lees heroes for that. Sir James Brooke, the well-known " Rajah of Sarawak," is tout bonnemnt a filibuster. Most of the Indian oficers who havo done most to maintain and to extend the inflauence of the English East India Company have been men who acted sternly and promptly in their dealings with the natives on their own responsibility, withont any regard to the " law of nations, and without altering their conduct one jot or tittle because they happened to fight under a "recognized flag." No " recognized flag" appears to entail any peculiar restrictions upon men fighting in remote places with bar. barons races. It would be hard to bring any charge against Walker of which Russian Generals in the Caucasus and French Generals in Algeria have not been guilty. Regret it as we may, we cannot get rid of the fact that civilization and commerce are determined upon taking possession of the globe-honestly if they can, but forcibly if they must. Wherever the civilized trader has come in contact with the barbarian we see the one advanoing remorselessly and invincibly, and the other receding helplessly and hopelessly. Look in what direction we mav, from Tartary to Texas, the same movement is goingon. We detest most of the consequences of the doctrine of " manifest destiny," but there is no escaping from the fact that the march of civilization is irresistible, and, moreover, that its track is but too frequently marked by violations of abstract right and justice. We mnst say, however, that nothing we read of FElibustering in past ages, or among foreign nations, reconciles us to the form it has taken and the agents it has chosen in these latter days. The great mass of those who in former times heve made their names famous in connexiuon with it were men Whom simplicity, enthusiasm, and faith, and an ambition which, if ferocious and cruel in many of its manifestations, was at least devout and lofty, raised far out of the common order of freebooters. They were " gentlemen"in an ae. When a " gentleman" was a better, braver, frecer man than his fellows,- man who, if uncrupulous in the selection of his means, vas at least lofty in his aims. They were men who roEe to the level of great undertakings in an age when great deeds were a necessity, and when man had to accomplish them with but little aid from art ,and mainly by his own courage and his own faith. Our modern Fillibusters re the scum of our society, not men whom quick bosoms" drive upon desperate adventures, but men whom rascality has outlawed, men hrom society, instead of sending forth with blessings, kicks out with contempt. Broken-down gamblers, drunken lawyers, unsuccessful publicans, dissipated shoemalkers, detested swindlers, men under whose feet every plank has broken, are those who now a days assume the bearing and attempt to walk in the footsteps of Cortez er of Clive. If modern civilization can find no better materials for its ad- vanced guard than the scrapings of bar-rooms and gaols, it, were almost better it should become stationary. If we cannot propagate "iAmericanism" by any mere decent agents than " Colonel" Titus or " General' Wheat it were better that the eagle should furl his nrgs The voice of a great nation should not make itself heard through the stammerings *ad belchings of drunkards. We confess we should like to see Central America a busy seat of commerce governed by our laws and progressing under our auspices. If Fillibusterinr means the spread of freedom of speech, of trial hy jury, of equal rights, of law and order, to regions which Providenoe has hitherto shrouded in barbarism, we confess we are Fillibusters. But if it mean simply, as its history in Nicaragua would seem to indicate, a sort of extension of South Carolina or Mssissippi with their various " Peculiarities," their mob law, their ferocious manners. their lazy habits. their sham chivalry, their censorship of the press, their stagnation and inanity-if it mean a reproduction ad ininitum of public men like Governor Wise and Colonel Davis, and the late lamented 'P.

After the roduction of November 10, the Horse Gu*ds a. lowed the reduced captains to avail themselves of Vaasc"s for two months in their respectiveregiments, but when thUt -timo had elapsed they could onlyoome in onclearvaeanc^ip such as those created by death, or offioers tking substantive rank; andthechances of such vancies are very xmal The result will be that the lieutenants wil get the step, +hat they wil become captains, attainnuk over the hebds of their senior, anomalous s that mra seem, and that The uifortunate half-pays If lucky, may h'ave to come in yea, hence below their juniors-perhape below men who e ntre the service as ensigns or cornets whea the half-pays lwre commanding compauies or troops. . The system of giving more t6an the regulation pricea. systnm] which the Horse Guards ought to grapple with and destroy, intead of dalying with it and gazing a it ascant, with hall-closed eyes-is the great bar to the fir settlement of the question. Tiht fair settlement, in my humble opinion, would be effected by filling up vacancle3 from tho half-pay list till a the offioers upon it were provided for. There are about 20 officers on full pay o0 cavalry who hold at this moment Staff appointmen4 Why should they not be required to make way for balf-pays, o0 -as many of them wonld do-to retain their Staff ppoint. ments but givo up their regimental rank? IspecMlly singl out the case of the cavalry, becaure the half.pays of that branch of the service have much less chance of getting back than the infantry, and they pay much lager gunm for their commimions. In June there wil be two cavalry regiments going out to India, and each will be augmented by 'four troops, but it is said that, instead of absorblng some of the half-pay; the Horne Guards intend givig one, if not two troops in ea without prchase to the senior lieutenants. With such a meritorious half-pay list this would be most nujust. The thing is bad enough at home. In the 11th Hussars three troops have been purch,oed by lientenants dnoe last January; two of these lieutenants have only threo yeas' servicoe, and yet twro captain of that regiment were reduced to half-pay, and are likely to remain on the list, after services in a regiment which bore so dis. tinguised a part in the Crimean campaign, or at least in the 3alaklava charge. There is no class of ofbers, I believe, in the army which is not animted and encouraged by the beLief thst the present active, honest, and indefatigable Chief at the Hors3 Guards is actuated by a sincere desire for their welfare, and to do all he can for them; but, at the same time, thosa Daddy Hardacres at the Treasury, who strain at gnats ana swallow camels, have most tremendous power, and wiel& their battle-axe of economy in the most rathless way ir, lopping off the heads of-not the tallest, but the smalest poppies of the gaden. For about 5,0004 per annum every one of the cavalry captains could have been kept on full pay tiU he was absorbed, and the sum for the Infantry would havo been somewhat smaller in proportion; in fact, half the cost of the unfinished, and never-to-be-finished barracks at Aldershott would have more than met the requirements of these gallant officers, who are not, nevertheless, as I am, Your obedient servant. _ MALCONT2N-T.
TO THE EDITOB OP THE TIME& Sir,-When so many are 'writing aginst General A"b bnrnham, perhaps you will insert a Mine in his favour. I had charge of the outlying picket of my regiment in front of Rhodawallah on the night before Sobraon, and cam tell you that he visited us and went round the sentries oa that night about U o'clock (and it was fortunate he did& for his brigade major had forgotten to give us the parole; and the General, after expressing his indiguation in prett, strong terms, had to give it ze himself), and I believe i, was his practice to visit the pickets of the brigade ever_r night, so that you see his " discretioa" sometimes took a, right tarn. As regards the seizure of the "lookout" occapied by the Sikhs, it was generally, and I believe correctly, understood. at the time that the honoar of ooening the engagement had been specially accorded to the gallant 62d by Lord Gaugi, himself, and therefore, had General Ashburnham detailed a regiment of his owvn brigade for that duty, he would mst, unjustly, and in the fao, too, of the Commander-inChief's own orders, have deprived the 62d of their privilege, his own regiment be it remembered, and one tbht had shown what they were worth at the sangainary battle of Ferozeshah, in leaving 1S officers and 280 men under the. enemy's guns. Then, again, as respects his "caution" in taling this outpost, I well remember that, when the flask companies of the 62d, who led the attack, supported by the remainder o, the regiment, cheered on entering, and finding it deserted, they were blamed for an indiscretion, but too Uk-ely to drawon them the attention of the enemy's camp before the actiom had fully commenced. General Ashbhrnham was only twice in action, and haI no opportunity of distinguishing himself. At Ferozqshah be commanded a briade composed of three native regiments, and it certinly was not his fault that he could donothing then. At Sobraon he had another brigade, consisting of the 9th Qaeens, 26th and 73d Native Infantry, strengtbened, when he ceme to advance, by Her Majesty's. 62d and a cempany of a native regiment (the 12th, I think), which had come up that morning with treasure from th8. rear, and attached itself to the 9th; but this brigade wanot only in reserve (and we all know what that means) but was placed allthe morning inrear of nd in support of th, 9-pounder and rocket batteries (which formed part of thFe grand arillery attack); and there we had to remain till ordered to advance. Doubtless, we were late coming into. action. All reserves are; some are never engaged at all and may not even come under fire. Witness the 4th Divi. sion at Alma. I have no connexion whatever with General Ashburnham, nor have I spoken to him since the eventful period referred! to above, but I think it very unfair to condemn a man before ho is tried, simply because he is placed in a responsible, poition; and, s a soldier, I deeply regret to see you lending our powerful support to his opponents on, most certa, ho suficient grounds. As one of your correspondents has alluded to LieutenantGeneral Grant, now Coimaxndcr.ia-Chief at Madrs I ma observe that, beins a-Company's offacer, hoe l not eligible forthe commnand in China, there the Company lhse nowr notroops The wing ef the native regiment lately sent from: Singapore to HongkonG il of course, return wrhena the, reinforcements shall arrive from EaRlandj IFAIRRLky.

3.- MQOBX-MUA1BKTatKIOX-TYIN.TBLL WBN Oi Monday Evening. The funds have been vory heavy to-day. Consols openiQd at a further decline of an eighth, and subse. quently showed increased weaknes, closing with a dull and uncertain appearance. The fint quotation formaoneywa 92WI to J, at which they remained till }ho afternoon, when they went to 92g to J., from which there was no recovery. For the 7th of May the last price was 92i to J, and for the new account In June it was 931 to J. No specific cause was asigned for the gloomy 8tate of the market, and it Js suppceed to be mainly attributable to the approach Df the settlement, and the desire of many of the speculators for a rise, wearied with the hill rate of interest, to close their accounts, Lower quotations from Paris contributed to the weakness at the end of the day, and in the prevailbg abeence of animation even the announcement of the failure of a French banking establishment with maoderate liabilities, which was mnade before the terraination of business, served to augment the uufavourablo tendenoy. The probability of an increase of our Eastern expenditure, from the extension of the war with China, exercises au adverse influence; -but, on the other hand, it does not seem to be anticipated that any large remittances will have to be rade to the continent for the supply of silver for the next mail, 'while, with regard to the subsequent one, the quantity from Mexico wiiU prove nearly aufficlent. It is hoped also that each packet from Sew York vwiU continue to bring intelligence of an improved rate of exchange, and that in the course of a few weeks the anxiety as to the silk crop in France, Spain, aud Italy will -aJe allayed, the accounts up to the present time not being unfavourable. Money was in active demand io-day in the Stock-E:xchange as well as at the Bank and in the discount-market, but there were no further withdrawals of gold for shipment, although the 200,0001. brought by the Anglesey is not expected to be delivered till the middle of the week. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 215 ; Reduced, 911 to i; New Tbree per Cents., 91 to i; India stcck, 220 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to i; and 3rndia Bonds, 7s. to 4s. discount. Exchequer-bills have been rendered comparatively firm by the purchases of the Government broker, and the last prices were, for the June descriptions 4s. discount to par; March, ls. discount to 2s. premium. Foreign securities were heavy, and Turkish ex. !?erienced a further decline. The Six per Cents. prresented the greatest depreciation, transactions havin taken place at 93j and 92i for money, and 3t 93 , i, 92, 03t, and 92i for the account. The ?our per Cents, for the account were negotiated at W0, 100, and 100k. To account for the fall an un-ounded report was spread that a bank, after having sately made large advances on the Six per Cents., had refused to continue or renew them. Other iiocks 'were also depressedI through increased sales. The bargains comprnsed,-Brazilian Five per Cents., for account, 99i; Ecuador Provisional Land Warrant, 4; Mexican, for account, 23i and i; Peruvian Four-and-a-half per Cents., for account, 'Ti ; the Three per Cents., for account, 54§; Pottuguese Three per Cents., for account, 44i; NRussian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 96q and i; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97, 97i, and i. The corn-market was again steady this morning, and in some instances an advance of is. was 6,stained. The final quotation of the French Tbree per Uents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was S9f. 20c. for both money and account, showing a decline of J per cent. Letters from Paris mention the stoppage of Messrs. Valie and Co., bankers in that city and at flavre. They were of respectable standing, but it Is not supposed their engagements are very considerable. The establishment of the firm at Havre was called the Caisse Commerciale, and, according to one of the newspapers: its managing director has absconded, specufatlons on the Bour8e being amsigned as the reason. At Hamburg the rate of discount is maintained at 7 per cent. In Paris the demand is active at 6 percent., and, as the Bank have no power to raise heir charge abiove that point, their only resoturce in ease the pressure should increase will he again to imit their advances to biUls of short date. The rate " at Amsterdam remains at 4 per cent., and in Bel- glum it is 3A. The London subscription list for the Russian railway scheme is to be opened to-morrow. Meanwhile the Russian Government are using every effort to cause the shares to float, and have just decreed that they shall be received at St. Petersburg at par in all cases where parties have to deposit security with the State. The Board of I'rade returns for the past month have been issued to-day, and show a continued increase in the declared value of our exportations. The augmentation is 1,007,7781., or more than 10 per cent, as compared with the corresponding month of lest year, and 3,145,0431., or 43 per cent, as compared with March, 1855. The annexed table shows the exact increase or decrease under each head. Oil-seed and wool are almost the only articles on the unfavourable side, and the falbing off in the shipment of these is simply to be attributed to their being retained to supply the wants of our own farmers and manufacturers:- The total inerease of our exports for the first quarter of thb year has been nearlv 15per eent. As -compared with the corresponding quarter of 1855 it has been about 52 per cent. With regard to imported commodities a decrease is shown in the arrivals of wheat and flour, but other descriptions of grain have been largely talken. In animals and salted provisions there has been an increase. Cocoa, coffee, and sugar show a falling off as regards the home consumption, and also tea, in eonsequence of the limited deliveries pending the reduction of the duty, but the quantities imported and taken into stock present an increase. Wines, epirits, tobacco, fruits, and spices exhibit an increase, both as .regards importation and consump. tion. Subjoined are the quantitiea of provision; &a., :Inported and taken for home consumption J.nu 'ouowlng are the comparative importa and exporta of raw matwWiaI, ihowing an inereaso in each instance except that of taMow, which was kept back forvpeculative-purpose :- - The miscellaneous imports have likewise been large, and tend to explain the heavy payments abroad, while they also lead to the inference that our stocks must in most cases have improved. Dyes and dyeing stuffs, leather manufactures, metals, and timber have all arrived in full quantities. In the general business of the port of London during the past week there hat been little change. The number of vessels reported inw7ard was 187, being 7 less than in the previous week. The total number cleared outward was 1G7, showing an increase of 55, including 29 in ballast. The number of ships on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 54; and of those 6 are for Adelaide, 7 for Geelong, 3 for lobart Town, 4 for Launceston, 2 for Melbourne, 4 for NTew Zealand, 13 for Port Phillip, 1 for Portlaid Bay, 1 for Perth, 12 for Sydney, and 1 for Swan River. The departures from the port of Londona for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised seven vessels-t-Wo to Port Philip, three to Adelaide, one to New Zealand, and one to Launceston, with an aggregate capacity of 4,503 tons. The rates of freight exhibit increased firmness. According to the circular of M. Arles Dufour, of Lyons, the accounts of the silk crop have thus far been generally favourable. In France the worms are couing out. In Spain and Naples they have successfully passed the secondc stage. A sudden fall in the temperature lately caused very serious, but it is believed unfounded, nlarmi, and temporarily induced a feverish activity in prices, the transactions towards the close of last week having been very extensive. It is impossible, however, at present to form a reliable opinion on the state and probable result of the crop, and it is thought, whatever may be its termination, quotations will remain hligh, and that China and Benial silks will maintain their growing favour with the continental manufaoturer. It appears from an order recently issued by the Ottoman Porte that all vessels under the English, French, and Austrian flags, carrying mails, wiUl be permitted to pass the Dardanelles at any time of the day or night. Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co. passed their final examination to-day in the Birmingham Bankruptcy Court without opposition. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day Mr. Craufurd the manager who succeeded Mr. H. J. Cameron, and Mr. Page and Mr. Chandler, the auditors, were examined in relation to the affairs of the Royal British Bank.

TURpIISH MisSIoNS AID SoomimY.-The annual in eetsng of this society was held yesterday afternoon at WillWis Rooms. The cbair 'was occtupied by Mfr. Trotter, and subsequently by the Earl of Shaftesbury, who was unable to be present at the commencement of the proceedings. The Secretary read copious extracts from the annual report, from which it appeared that the society's funds are applied ciefy in aid of the American imissionaries i-a TuLrkey, who have numerousstations in that empire, and throug whose agency it was stated Protestant Christiaiity has been for many years successfully promulgated among Mahometans and menmbers of the Greek church. It was announced that a new mission vas about to be undertaken in Bulgaria, for which considerable sums of money had been specia31y sub. scribed. The beneficial effects of the late comzaercia and religiouis concessions of the Turkish authorities were alluded to, and notice was taken of the establishment of an Armenian newspaper under Protestant auspices-the religious press being, as was alleged, as free in Turkey as in ngland. The American missionaries in Persia had suffered great persecution on the pretext of their being zeligions agents, bt since the return of peace they had been suffered to resume their labours. The meeting was addressed by the Rev. T. Aveling, the Rev. Mr. Sterne, and GenezalSirF. Wiiams. he last-named speaker bore testimony, from long personal observation, to the great value of the labours of the American missionaries in Turkey and Persia, and to the zeal and assiduity with which they discharged their callin, even. amid the most discouraging circumstances. Several: other addresses having been delivered, a vote of thanks was unanimously accorded to the chairman, the Barl of Shaftesbury, who said that the American missionaries in Turkey merited the fullest confidence that could be reposed in them ; that it would have been inexpedient andI disc-ourteous to establish an English mission in tte same fied, and thatt English Christians could not do better than give the exist. iug mission their earndest suppoit.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TZIES. Sir,-By parish-whers for rnore than a month hundreds of discharged 30vernment operatives have waited in anxs ious expectation of assistanco from their late employersowes you a deep debt of gratitude for your recent article. At. the eleventh hour, when their small resources are exhausted, they have received an unfavonrable answer from the head of the War Department. It would be otherwise I cannot but think, could Lord Panmure occupy for a single day the post I fill, and see the sufferings of the men to whose skiU and strength, no less than to the courage of our soldiers, we owe the successful termination of the late war. While it lasted they not only laboured inordinately at the command of Government, but violated their consciences by the sacrifice of their Sunday's rest; and ate they now to be disowned and discarded because they have too successfunly accomplished their task? All they askl is that soune of the ships now lying idle in our harbours, and, perhaps, after a few Years to be broken up for firewood, should bO employed to convey them to those colonies where, hitherto, we have sent only our thieves and cutthroats. Can we doubt that, when our colonists saw the Union Jack float over such a cargo of Saxon worth and energy, they would feel that a fresh link had been formed between Britain and her dependencies ? At a great meeting in Woolwich, pre. sided over by our gallant member, Sir William Codring. ton, I last nfght pledged myself, on behalf of i ray parish, that, if 'Government would grant the ships, we who remained behind *rould talke care that no emigrant should depart unprovided either with physical or spiritual bom. forts. The head of the Government is known to be a Iian of generous sentiments, and we look to n7Ie Times to Fee to it'that a nieasure; nhot so much of benevolence as ofjuitloe, be not set aLside by the indifference or red-tapeisMn of his sabordinateo. I have the honour to be, your obedient servant. w. ACWORTH. zrumseaca Vicarage, April 25.

LONDON, TUESDAY, APR?L 28, 1857. " We " who work hard-for we do work hardare beginning to be almost ashamed of drudgery. It's going altogether out of fashion. One hardly goes anywhere without hearing of somebody who has a soul above his work. Our columns are full of protesta against this disagreeable condition of human existence. There are those who submit to it, and thrive upon it, both in body and soul, who retain their looks, their temper, and their spirits, and who can sbelve all their carea every evening as easily as a itradesman his ledger; but they can only be of common earthly monld. For the higher class of minds something else must be found betterthan business, profession, office, or any set form of mental operation. Even they who submit to work do so indignantly; their higher nature breaks out, and they reveal themselves every now and then as the victims of a noble discontent. Why cannot life be all poetry, or all wit, or all love, or all eloquence, or all Parliamentary debate, or all something ethereal and essential, instead of so much listening to dry details, and writing and reading, and saying and doing the same things over and over again? We are horses in a mill; it is the system; the earth goes round itself, and the moon goes round the earth, and they both go round the sun; and so we must go round some work or post every day, and the work round itself every year, and so on. Let us, then, rouse ourselves and be men, ere the centrifugal force be entirely extinct, and ere we condemn ourselves to eternal rotation and revolution. We have plenty of warnings ;-two just now. To our great regret,-for we regret it while we do honour to the greatness of soul which prompts the course,-Mr. P{Nn has given up the vulgar monotony of the Second Secretaryship of the Admiralty, and the equally vulgar security of an official residence and 1,6001. a-year. Any clerk may do the work, and ought to do it, so his friends say, for much less than he has Teceived for it. There are so many masters, such division of duties snd independence of jurisdiction, so little responsibility left to the permanent officers, and so much affixing of signatures 'which mean nothing, that Mr. PENx can stand it no longer. Nothing will tempt him to stay, not even the consideration -which ties thousands to an ill choice once made. For this office he sacrificed his seat in Parliament, his former office as Counsel to the Admiralty, and his Recordership. This was a high price to pay for any one thing in this world. Not one of these three can he now recover,-at least, there are the greatest odds against it. He can only try to get back his private practice, perhaps in vain. Such a man is a martyr on the altar of loyalty, or official ambition, or some honourable principle; for a msrtyr he certainly is, and we are bound to respect a Tmn who can victimize himself in so cruel a way, even if the inferiority of our notions does not permit us quite to appreciate the feelings which prompt it. But Lord Chiel Justice Cooaxvnw has perhaps. even stronger claims to our admiration. He also is sacrificing hiniself, not by giving up his office, but by resigning himself to it. He has just been to Southampton, and there the dear old faces that he used to see about him, and the soft sotud of many compliments in his eams, recalled too painfully the days that are gone by; and the Lord Ohief Justice told them all, in a most pathetic speech, how much pleasanter, and nobler, and frecer, and more congenial he I had found it to be member for Southampton than Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The citizens of Southampton are probably much like other citizens, and therefore would probably be rather pleased than otherwise that the object of their choice and their friendship should obtain sO high a position. But, speaking to these citizens, the Lord Chief Justice says-" To be, as I " have said, your representative in Parliament, "and to fill the high office of Attorney-General of "England, were to me the summit of ambition. I "desired nothing further, and, if I could have had "my will and way, that was the position I should "have filled to this hour, and never have desired "to part with it while I had strength and energy "to fulfil its duties. But, alas I man cannot "frame his own destiny as he will, and I became "conscious that many years of active life, and "five of the combined efforts of official and Par"liamentary labour, had produced a certain amount "of bodily wear and tear. I was told that certain "warnings were not to be neglected, and that I ;should do wrong, and perhaps destroy my capacity "for public usefulness altogether, if I did not accept "the highly honourable office which I now fill, and "which is far beyond anything I could have laid "claim to. Had I followed my own will I should "still be Attorney-General, and, may I add, till "representative of Southampton; but wise and "anxiovs friends counselled me, and to their "sober wisdom I have yielded. I should have "preferred still to toss on the stormy sea of "political life rather than to be navigating the "smooth and tranquil waters in which I now "float; and I can amsure you from the bottom "of my heart that one of the greatest of my "pangs is the severance of that connexion with "you, which formed my greatest happiness." It is true the office is one of the highest prizes of legal and even political ambition. The Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas sits in the sight of the whole nation; his name is ever before those who have to do with law; it occurs continually in the annals of jurisprudence; and the holders of the office are a bright and memorable succession, who wil be handed down to all time. It is true, also, that a Lord Chief Justice, and every high legal personage, are continually sustaining and improving the great fabrio of the law, and strengthening that political constitution and' those principles which are the glory of this nation. It'is true,'too, that the office is one of those that are the natural termination of certain political careers, and that the man who wins it carries off a high prize from many competitors. It might be added that the nation regards its judges with something more than awe and respect; it has even some of that afflection towards them that the tender-hearted citizens of Southampton have for their late representative. We are all moved by the very aspect of the patient judge listening hour after hour and day after day to conflicting testimonies and bewildering arguments, and then carefully extracting from the entangled mass the bright essence of truth. We are, too, ourse!'ves simple enough to think that the great officers of the State ought to magnify their offices and back up the State, making the most of its h6nours, counting its service heroism, its sacrifice martyrdom, its drudgery a labour of love, and death therein that happy death which the ancients loved to die. But what of all these natural, old-fashioned considerations ? Hard work is out of fashion. The pleasure is in the rapidity and brilliancy, not the certainty, of the pursuit. Better spend a life of sparring and fencing, tilting and fighting, all manner of ways with worthy foemen in the House of Commons, than sit on a bench and administer so slow a thing as the law of the land. Pity 'tis that the ebbing stream of life, the waste of nervous tssues, and the slow eclipse of genius should itself interfere with the battles of genius and eloquence. But, tiU they do, Lord Chief Justice CocxKBRn thinks it much better to spend a life in brilliant talk than in the dull performance of that merely necessary work, the administration of the law of the land. We are aware that we owe an apology, and that we shall lower ourselves in the opinion of the more exalted class of minds, but we may as well boldly avow at once that we side with the old humdrums on this interesting question. We have an immense respect for the service of the CuowN-, particularly for those higher dignities, of which anybody in society can name the present holders. But our respect is not confined to that vain consideration. As for the drudgery of some of these offices, we must confess that we find drudgery inseparable from all employments of utility and real power. The greatest men have been the greatest drudges. Hlow they kept up their genius, their ardour, their strength of will, their indepen- I dence of opinion, their p6rsonal dignity of manner, and all that made them what they were, and what some still are, it is needless to guess about, for such is the fact. What greater drudge was there ever on the face of the earth than the late Duke of WEn11GTOx, always reading blue-books, writing despaeches and official memoranda, keeping daybooks and indexes innumerable? Then, think of Lord ELnox and his brother I But why need we go beyond the living? There is Lord Chief Justice CArPnBnL. What a life of legal toil in every form has he gone through, and how much has he found time for besides I Then there ia our ever brilliant, ever gay, ever witty, ever buoyant, ever youthful PRFmux, Nobody ever spent such a life of official drudgery. Nobody ever held Wo many offices so long and with so little intermission. There is hardly a Govermaent office which does not contain volurae upon volume of his minutes, all drawn up with the greatest care. When Lord PAI.MSTON, who holds the highest prize of political warfare, has never been ashamed or wearied of drudgery, even to clerks' work, why should those who have been i at least lesu succesful ? The way to dignify and enliven an offico is to make the most of it, to dis. charge it aa 'well as posible, to bring the mind to bear upon every part of it, and so to malke the work not only more beaable and iutellectual for oneself, but also for one's succeMors, and in that way more serviceable to its ends and beneficial to the State.
To speak of the state of the country at the present time is only to repeat continually the word " prosperity."' Both the United Kingdom and its colonies seem to be advancing in a career of material increase of which it is impossible to predict the term. The accounts relating to Trade and Nliavigation for the first quarter of 1857 have just been published, and show an advance sufficiently striking even on the prosperous year 1856. The total declared value of the exports of the United Kingdom for the maonth of March was 10,456,3481. sterling, and for the first quarter of the year 28,827,4931. Both the month and the quarter show a considerable increase over the corresponding terms in 1856 and' 1855. Taking the quarter, as allowing a fairer comparison, we find that the value of the exports waa, for 1855, 18,808,5171. ; for 1856, 25,149,1031.; and for 1857, 28,827,4931.-or an increase of about 15 per cent. on last year. Now, as the total amount for 1856 was nearly 116,000,0001., we may expect, if this advance be kept through the whole of the four quarters, that the total value of exports fqr the present year will exceed 133,000,0001. This enormous amount is evidently the fruit of no temporary or morbidly stimulated traffic, but represents a legitimate and progressive increase in the production and commerce of the country. When it is considered that the exports of 1855wereonly 98,000,0001., and that onsequentlythere has been an increase of moreAtlIan one-third. within two years, no argument is necessaryto prove that the country is advancing at a rate which leaves all calculation behind. With regard to the details of our import and export trade some interesting facts are found in the return. The British people are not disposed to deny themselves the luxuries which their increasing wealth can purchase, so that it is natural to find a large advance in quantity and value of all kinds of imports. In spite of the apprehended murrain, 7,318 oxen, bulls, and cows were inported in the first quarter of 2857,a number much in advance of 1856, though not equalling the importation of 1855, which seems to have been particularly large. The materials for innocent beverages have been brought into the country in greatly increased quantities. Of cocoa 1,713,0001b. were imported in the firt quarter of 1857 against 1,024,192 in 1856, and 734,558 in 1856. It weuld seem, therefore, that the consumption of this nourishing drink has doubled in two years. Coffee shows a considerable fluctaation. In 1855 the importation for the quarter was 4,107,4671b., for 1856 it fell off to 3,676,9251b., and for 1857 it is 5,042,8331b. Although, of course, a single quarter, and particularly the winter quarter, does not give an average free from the influence of all disturbing causes, yet it is pretty clear that a large augmentation in the consumption has taken place within the two years, indicating a corresponding inrease in the comforts of the people. The quantity of wheat imported during the late quarter was 599,492 quarters,-but little lessthan the importation for last year, and considerably greater than that for 1855, which amounted to 422,285 quarters. The wheat meal and flour imported is almost the same as last year; it amounts to 631,328 quarters, while the importation for 1855 was 348,672. The inrease in the quantity of these articles brought from the United States is truly wonderfuL In 1855 it was 142,416 quarters; in 1857 it in 596,814 for the same term of three months. The importation of cotton shows a decrease compared with 1856, but. still is far in adv ance of 1855. For the first quarter of 1855 1,559,782 Cwt. were imported; for 1856, 1,843,703; for 1857, 1,1716,586. The quantity from the UnitedStates is, however, less than in either of the twro previous years, being 1,390,0O8cwt. in 1857, against 1,590,661 in 1856, and 1,431,234 in 1855. To remedy in some degree this deficiency we have a gratifying inrease in the importation from India, the quantity being in the first quarter of 1855 75,222cwt., and for the corresponding periods of the two next years 171,110 and 191,688. The inpOrtation from E3gypt has also more than doubled within the two years, while that from Brazil has increased from 28,4141b. to 81,1121b. Although the statistics of so short a term may be delusive, yet it is to be hoped that they represent in this case & growing increase in the cotton production of the globe, and that the danger, so much dreaded, of the spindles of Iancashire and ?Tew England lacking their supply of material may never be realized. After corn and cotton aU other products are of smaU importance. We may, however, relate, for the gratification of the curious, that 1,430,807 pairs of gloves were im- portedinthe last three months; that duringthe same term26,041,600 eggswerebrought into the country, or nearly an egg a-piece for the whole population. The quantity of wuie entered for home consumption shows a steady increase. It was for the first quarter of 1855 1,464,105 galUons, and for the first quarter of the last and the present year 1,742,877 and 1,935,293 gallons respectively. The scale on which our export trade is conducted may be conceived from the fact that in the first quarter of 1855 we supplied foreign countries and our own colonies with 772,778 tons of coal; that the quantity for the same term of 1856 rose to 1,072,037 tons; and that for the present year it is 1,254,107 tons. A million and a-quarter of tons of coal exported in three months gives a sufficient proof how much the world is dependent on the resources of this country, and also at what an accelerated rate we are bringing into requisition the supplies of fuel which exist in the bowels of the eartb. With regard to our greatest article of manufacture, we find that the declared value of the cotton goods exported in the last three months was 7,267,4321.,against 6,332,2691. in 1856, and 5,882,096Z. in the year before. The exPorts of cotton amount in value to considerably more than a third of the whole. Iron and woollens come next, 'and the increase has been considerable on almost every item. So that before arriving at the bottom of the list we are quite prepared to find that even the vast tota l amount of the last years exports is likLely to be largely exceeded. The account of the nuraber and tonnage of vessels which entered inwards and cleared outwards with cargoes for the firt quarter of the three years shows an increase in navigation corresponding to the progress in manufactures. For the quarter ending March the 31st, 1855-6-7, the tonnage of the shipping entered inwards was 1,118,213, 1,318,310, and 1,436,616. Of this last amount, representing the first quarter of the present year, 893,008 tons were British, and 275,262 American. We may state, for the satisfaction of the prophets who saw ruin in the repeal of the navigation laws, that we are holding our own on the seas. The British tonnage for the three quarterly terms is 687,444, 840,485, and 893,008 tons; the American, 262,353, 254,931, and 275,262 tons. We therefore have 6ur full share of the increase. 'he return of vessels cleared outwards shows pretty much the same state of thing. The tonnage of British ships taking out cargoes has risen from 926,593 in the first quarter of 1855 to 1,199,950 for the same period of 1856, and 1,363,975 for 1857,-aan increas of nearly 50 per ent., forming a conclusive proof of the vigour of our export I I trade. On the whole, these returns are to the full as satisfactory as the most hopeful man could have *.de%ired. It is now evident that the sudden rise of 1856 was not merely the reaction from the depression of war, but the natural, though surprising progress of an active and enterprising people.
In a few weeks it is hoped that a ,ombined British and Amenrcan squadron may leave these shores upon such a mission as was never yet conceived, and that the Terrible, the Niagara, and the Agamemnon may find themselves in the centre of the great Atlantic Ocean with the charge and thei power of coupling the Old and New Worlds together. Of the material machinery by which i this extraordinary feat is to be accomplished we ! have already given the public some idea, but there are other circumstances connected with the project which -well deserve notice. A single glance at the map of the world wilt explain the selection of the two points through whichEurope and.Americaareto bebrought intocontact. Ireland on the one side of the ocean, and Newfoundland on the other, lie like outworks of the two continents, and diminish considerably the breadth of .waters otherwise interposed between them. Across the bed of the ocean, too, in these very parbx, is to be found a kinda of raised bank or plateau thrown up by the rush of the Gulf Stream, and on this the telegraphic wires are to be depositedL No conditions, in short, could appear more favourable, more opportune, or more publicly available, and yet it actualy happened that the power of bargaining for the use of them was lodged in the hands of a commercial company. The fact is, that a monopoly had been granted of telegraphic communication across the island of Newfoundland. As long ago as 1852 exclusive privileges of this description were conferred upon an association established for the purposes abovementioned, and the monopoly, after various modifications and transfers, became vested at last in a company enjoying for a term of years the exclusive right of telegraphing from one side of Newfoundland to the other, and indeed of establishing any telegraph in the island at all. Accordingly, the Atlantic Telegraph Company, after conquering the ocean, might have found an invincible barrier at the very point where the diffculties of the enterprise would have been supposed to cease. The Newfoundland Company were in possession of the last few miles of the distance, and were therefore as completely masters oe the whole course as a railway company would be which commanded the terminus and the half-dozen nearesu miles of a rivaI line. The fact would have been of less importanco if other parts of the American coast had been accessible at no further cost than that of some additional miles of wire; but it seems to be doubted, inthe present state of information on the subject, whether any Transatlantic communication can be established except through some point or other of that territory which the Newfoundland monopoly embraces. Ultimately, therefore, these privileges, though at first perhaps appearing insignificant, have exerted an influence over the whole arrangements of this most important international enterprise. The Newfoundland Company makes terms with the Atlantic Company, the Atlantic Company makes terms with the British Government, and, if it should really be found that no other point of American territory can be reached by oceanic wires, the communication between two mighty continents of the world will have depended upon the modification or purchase of a small commercial monopoly. At present we believe the conditions arranged provide for the accommodation- of the. public at reasonable rates. The Atlantic Company acquire the beiefit 6f the exclusive privileges existing in Newfoundland, and make arrangements for the transmission of messages over the whole course of. the combined Telegraphs. The British Government is to have the power of fixing the rates to be charged for communications, and to enjoy a preferential right of using the Telegraph, a similar privilege being allowable to the United States' Government on the other side. In return for these powers of control, Government first aids the undertaking with ships in the work of laying down the cable, and then provides a pecuniary guarantee. The company is to receive the sum of 14,0001. per annum, constituting a return of 4 per cent. upon its capital, until the net profits shall amount to 6 per cent., after which 10,0001. per annum is to be paid for 25 years. This paymient, however, is to cover, as far as it goes, the charges incurred by Government communications; the excess, if any, of such charges over the amount of the guarantee being receivable also. Under the existing circumstances of the monopoly, perhaps these arrangements were as good as could be made, but the story offers striking evidence of the extent to which the greatest enterprises may be affected by even small infractions of sound commercial principles. M5onopolies are just as great mistakes now as in any former age of the world. It may be undoubtedly desirable, and in some instances even imperatively necessary, to encourage undertakings of high public atility but dubious commercial promise by the support of a guarantee, but these considerations contain no warrant for the addition of a monopoly to boot. In the present instance, the exclusive right of telegraphing across Newfoundland-a privilege to be regarded, perhaps, with extreme unconcern apart from the oceanic extension of the wires-actually governs the Transatlantic communication between the two Continents, and the effecte of a monopoly have to be overcome by a State guarantee and Government controL The Government may fix the rate of charge for the public, and therefore for itself, but it must make up the sum. of its payments to 14,0001. at the end of each year. It may protect the public from extortion, but only at the cost of that kind of interference which must be troublesome to itself, ancd which we are not apt to regard as conducive to good management. Finally, if. contrary to present expectation, any telegraphic communication should be found practicable between our own coasts and points of the opposite shore not covered by the monopoly, Government may remain committed to an unnecessary and unproductive guarantee. As things stand, however, there is not much to complain of. Compared with the magnitude of the enterprise and the value of the results, the amounts of the capital and the guarantee involved are but small; and if, as we trst will be the case, the experiment of next July should prove sucessful, and the American Continent be brought within a few minutes of our shores upon reasonable terms of conimunication, there will be no reason to regret the concession of the guarantee. It is in principle rather than effect that the Newfoundland monopoly is so noticeable. It may seem an inconsiderable circumstance, or even wear. the aspect of an excellent bargain, if any company or assoiation can be induced to accomplish at their own cost a- most desirable work on the sole condition that nobody else shall be permitted to do it over again; but experience has taught us, and the present example shows, that such a surrender of general rights may eventually carry with it unexpected disabilities and serious embarrasment. . Enterprise, when beyond the scope of private venture, may be fairly entitled to public aid, but not to aid of such a kind as may strangle for the future all similar enterpriso in the same field.
INDIA AND CHINA. By the arrival of the Overland M3il we hbae received our correspondence and journal from Cal. cutta to the 23d of March, Bombay the. 2d of April, and HloDgkong to the 15th of March. The following are the letters of our correspondents _, CALCUTTA, MAIct 23. " The Government has resolved to puniih the 19th Regiment of Native Infantry-that concerned in the mutiny at Berhampore. It has been ordered to Barrackpbreo where it will bedisbanded. The we| tence has not yet been promulgated, but my information is certain, and the General Order will pro. bably appear in the next Gazfet. The sentenoe, though inadequate to the offenoe, is not without a certain severity. Every native officer loses his commission. Every old Sepoy loses his pension, and, as the Companuy only receives recruits up to a certain age, his bread. The younger men will crofs over to Bombay and enlist there. It is the officers and the older men who are to blame, ana there is therefore justica in a punishment which fals almost exclusively on their heads. The order has been delay,ed by the. necesity of bringing another European regiment to Calcutta. The capital has for the Iast two years been left almost Unprotected. Formerly there was always a European regiment in the fort and 1,200 artillerymnen at D)umdum, eight miles off. The transfer of the Artillery head-quarters to Meertt left only one regiment in Calcutta, and tihni. is sometimes reduced to a wling. There are 5,000 Sepoys at Barrackpore. There is a bad spirit among some of them, and it is barely possible they may refuse to obey the order, or may display: their sympathy in a manner involving-a breach of discipline. In that cawe the fort, if not the town, would be in danger, and Government has acted wisely in providing against the poasibility of resistance. With two European regiments on the spot and three batteries in reserve, the Sepoys, however excited, will obey in silence. " I said the sentence was inadequate. As I write the papers bring intelligence of a mutiny among the Madras troops at Vizieragram. The Madra.ee have no caste, and their disontentmust therefore proceed from other causes than the cartridge order. The truth is, we are at this moment passing through one of those periodical storms which every now and then remind us that Government in India ' sits on bayonets.' The Sepoys are restless and dissatisfied. They have no particular grievances, no particular leaders, no particular wants. A war on this side of India would at once remove every symptom of disaffection. But they are idle, and brood, like all Asiatics, over imaginary wrongs ana absurd reports till they are ready for anything, no matter what, that will break the feverish monotony of their lives. Then we have gradually reduced the numLer of officers, by draining them off for staff employment, till there are not enough left to manage the regimients. Sepoys require nearly as much attention,a children. Under such circumstances mutiny, unless stopped by stern and striling punishment, is apt to become epidemic. The Government is quite prepared for such a contingency, and the next instance of insubordination will, I doubt not, be visited by a punishment that will ring through the native army. It is greatly to be regretted that it was not inflicted at once by Colonel Mitchell, while the 19th were in open mutiny. Had the regiment been mowed down by artilery we ahould have heard nothing of disaffection for another decade. I am not giving you a private opinion of my own; this is the universal cry of the public, as well as of the official world. The Europeans in India are too well aware what mutiny means to have the slightest mercy for the criminals. There are mnen among, us, men -in every other. relation of life of the highest charity, who almost wish that the diisbanding of the 19th may be resisted. The occurrence would relieve us of mutinies for a generation. " I give you the facts as they stand. I must beg your readers, however, not to believe the matter more serious than it is. The empire isin no danger. There is, so far as we know, no real disaffection among the great body of the army. Even the restleasness so conspicuous in places is confined to those places, and will cease the moment it is knopn the Government will endure no more. The Europeans,theSikhs, the Irregulars, the Cavalry, and the great body of the Infantry, are not simply obedient, but quite ready to crush the first symptom of disorder among their own comrades. The only real danger is lest the home authorities should neglect the warning, and refuse that remodelling of the staff sytem which every officer of experience has for the last ten years pointed out as the weak point of our rule. You will doubtless receive a great number of reports. All kinds of mad projects are attributed to the marked regiments. I believe these rumours all proceed from one source. An angry native alwaays talks just like an angry woman, aud threatens all sort of things he bas neither the power nor the inclination to carry out. These speeches are reported by talebearers, but, though they look very formidable on paper, they mean only this,-that those who utter thema are in a rage. " Mr. C. E. Boileau, Deputy-Commissioner of Goudah, in Oude, has been murdered. He had displayed much energy in hunting the dacoit Frusyl Ali into Nepaul, but failed to arrest him. He was riding quietly through his district, attended by only four horsemen, when he was attacked by Frusyl Ali and his followers. vIr. Boileau and his horsemen were cut to pieces and his head subsequently carried into Secrora. Theact hasnopolitical significance whatever. Frusyl Ali is simply a bandit, whom the police have been unable to catch. His doom, however, is now certan. The Government will hunt him for the next 20 years sooner than suffer him to escape, and Nepaul will not dare to protect the murderer of a European. It is reported that he has put his wives and children to death for fear they sho-uld be seized ash ostages-a practice which, though frequent under the native Governments, is, I need not say, quite foreign to our system. The deceased officer was a gallant, energetic fellow, very popular, and very much dreaded by all manner of Lcoundrels in his district. The province remains as quiet as ever. The King is still in Calcutta, and I need not say the reports that he is at the bottom of the recent mutinies are regarded as absurd. He has neither the energy, the brains, nor the inclination for a conspiracy. "A most important despatch has been received from home on the subject of the Madras tenue. The survey of the entire Presidency has been sanctioned. The Ryotwaree syatem is to be modified, or rather abolished, and the Khetwar introduced ' Khetwar' means field settlement, and is so called because the assessment is placed upon each field. The owner, whoever he may be, is liable for the tacx, and nothing else, his right of property while ho pays it being perfect. The advantage of the change is, that as land rises in value capitalists may buy field after field, and turn the ryot into a labourer ou weekly wages. In ether words, the Iriah system may be gradually superseded by the English; we get rid of the pauper proprietary, and land once more acquires a value. In many pa&; Of Madras a gift of 50,000 acres would not be worth I having. Moreover, the ausesment is to be reduced one fourth, and fixed for 30 years. The reform is in the highest degree creditable to its authors, and will in no long period produce an important change in the social aspect of Madras. At present tha,t Preeidency is totally without rich men, without anybody who can stand against a fanine or a flood.

"I had hoped by this opportunity to be able to write you of the attack and capture of Molmnrnerah, which, as I mentioned in my last, was expected to take place about the 20th of last month. No intelligence of the lind has, however, yet r%ched Bombay. The latest newvs from Bushire ws brought down a week ago by a aailing vessel which had been 20 days at sea. When she left, on the 6th, t'he force for Mohammerah was being embark-ed with al speed. The guns and men of the 3d Troop of Horse Artillery sailed for the mouth of the Euphrates on the 5th. Other portions of the force had already preceded them, and the rest would shortly follow. The fleet was to rendezvous at the entrance of the river and then to proceed up to Mohan3merah by the channel caled Shatt-el-Arab, which was being carefully buoyed by a small steamer hired by the Government from the Peninsular and Oriental Company. " We are, u may be supposed, anxiously awaitiilg the confirmation of the pacific rumours which formed part of our latest English intelligence. Few, I think, now anticipate a prolongation of hostilities. Nevertheleas, the preparations of the Governmen' to meet the contingency of a protzacted warfare continue with unabated energy. Two more Native Infantry Regiments are warned for service. The 3d Europeans, as I mentioned in my last, are not to go. But the Madras Government has found itself able to lend its 1st European Regiment or Fusileers for service, and this corps has already sailed for Bombay, whence it will be conveyed to Bushire. I am happy to say that the acoounts of the state of feeling in the lately-disturbed regi. ments of the Bengal and Madras armies are now more satisfactory. On the Madras side, indeed, it was only in one corps that symptoms of disaffection had appeared, and these seem to have been caused by the issuing of an injudicious order, and to have ceased with its withdrawaL. I suppose, therefore, that there was nothing to interfere with the sending the Fusileers out of the Presidency. Their place a; Madras is supplied by a wing of the 43d Light Infantry from Bangalore, which in marching down was unfortunately attacked by cholera. From the accounts in the local papers it would appear that no fewer than 32 men, two women, and nine children had succumbed to the disorder up to the 26th of last month. The remainder of the sick were, however, for the most part convalescent, and the violence of the disorder seemed to be abating since the arrival of the troops at Madras A native corps, also marching to the Presidency, the 39th, has been severely stricken by the same terrible malady. "There is little or nothing of importance to relate from Cabul or Centrat Asia. Dost Mahomed had not up to the 4th of March returned to his capitas but was still at Jellalbad or in its neighbourhood, engaged in the attempt to settle a variety of questions pending between himself and the mountain chiefs. The murder of Lieutenant Hands, during his visit to the Chief Commissioner, he was endeavouring fully to investigate and to punish. Meanwhile the position of Ryder Khan at Candahar must have been a sufficiently ting one. Straitened in men, money, and providions, and anticipating that his fortitied outpost of Ghirisk would shortly be attacked in overwhelming force by the Persians, he was querurougly threatening, if report speaks true, to throw uphiscommanduniewspeedilyreinforedandconceal his shame and vexation in a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Prophet. Ere this he has probably been joined by the English envoys sent into Affghanista.n from Peshawur the brothers Lnmaden and Dr. BeUew. Of these officers we learn from Cabul that they had arrived by way of the Koorum Valley, at the town of that name, and had started again for Elelat-iGhilzie and Candahar under protection of an escort.

LlViRPOOL$ APRIL 29r The Royal Mail steainship Asia has aried with Advices from New York to the 15th inst. she has brought $322,382 in specie on freight. * The United-States' mail steamship Ericeson, hence, ana the hamburg steamer Borusia had arrived at New York. The Ioial Mail st~eamner Clyde arrlved at Aupin. ,>,11io,n, the 4th nst. Tlie convention ewttling the qu,estion of te Sound Dues between the United States and Denmark had been signed at Washington by the Secretary of State, Mr. Cas, aad AL Bille, the Danish Minister. The United States' Governinent agrees to pay Dewiatm kthesumof 717,829 rixdollars Danish, or $393,000 American,: being the proportion that- falls to the share of the United States by the, capitalization of the dues. The new American Minister to China, Mr. Reed, will i2sit London and Paris on his way overland to Canton, and confer with the Governments of EBgl Ind andFranceastotheir policy, and the latest state of the affairs in the East. The steam frigate Niagara would be ready for seabout the 18th inat. The Susquehanna was likely to accompany her while laying the Atlantic cable. Her commander was in hopes of obtaining permisaion to, start for England without the delay of a preliminary trial trip. Professor Morse would be among the few allowed to be on board. Sailors were very scarce at New York, even at. advanced wages. It was reported that a body of troops would be sent to the Salt Lake to establish proper authority among the Mormons. A very serious fire bad occurred at Baltinore, causing a loss of about $500,000. An election riot occurred at Quebec on the ILbt, and the military had fo be called out. Unreliable accounts from Nicaragua state that Lockridge had beaten the Costa Ricans at Castilo and taken the place. There was no intelligence aout Walker. The George Law had arrived with the Californiau mail and nearly $1,250,000 in gold. Trade at Sani Francisco was improving. The receipts of golddust were very large. Nothing more had been done regarding the repudiation of the State debt. Advices from Greytown to the 2d inst. state that thet a was some excitement on the Isthmus, growing out of an apprehension that the natives designed to attack the foreigners. The Railroad Company was taking everyprecaution to protect the passengers and their property during the transit. A bearer of despatches fr.0m. Bogota embar'ked- on his way to Washington withs news that Mr.-Morse. had been refused all. negotiation on the riot question. A proposition had been made in the New Granada Senate to send a force to the Isthmus, which met with opposition. At Havanna, on the 8th, exchange on London was 51 to 6 per cent. Sugar had advanced half a real per barrel, owing to diminished receipts, and freights had declined, owing to the number of vessels. Advices from Vera Cruz to the 4th inst. report that the clergy had openly declared against and denounced the new constitution in all the churches. The Governmrent were about to call the Archbishop and other prominent ecclesiastics to account. The army bad sworn to the new constitution. The (overnment had issued a manifesto to the nation reviewiDg its acts. A battalion of National Guards with a small force of artillery, had been sent to Tehuantepec to guard the national interests in that quarter. Disorders had taken place there, and many persons were killed. At New York a good demand prevailed for money, but there was no change in rates, the supply being fully equal to the demand. At the close there was a somewhat firmer feeling in financial circles, consequent npon the rather unfavourable exhibits of tho banks and the continued drain of specie to the interior. There was little or no coin going abroad, but apprehensions were entertained in some quarEers that renewed shipments on a large scale would speedily ensue as the result of the advance In exchange. Moneyrates were 8 to 9 per cent. on 60 to 90 days' biUs, 9 to 10 per cent. on 4 and 6 months' acceptanesm, and 7 per cent. on caL The bank statement snowed a further increase in the discount line, while there was a decrease in the specic averages of $500,000. The arrival of about $1,250,000 from California would go towards replenishing the vaults of the Bank and affording the amount that would probably be wanted during the week for shipment to Europe 'The deposits, after allowing for the operations at the clearing-house, showved an increase of about $147,000. The stock-market wvas extremely unsteady, and towards the close sales were made at lower price-; at the cloee, however, they shoy.ed si of improvement. The foreign news and uneasinessin the foreign stock-market operated unfavourably. The quotations were-New York Sixes, 101; Indiana Fives, 82i; North Carolina Sixes, 93; Missouri Sixes, 84; Erie Sevens, 1859, 956; New York Central, 87.; Newr York and Erie, 51k; udson River, 25+; flaarlem, 12; Reading, 79; 'Michigan Central, 34 Pa=aa, 92. In exchange .the businesa for the Asia was very large at firm prices; on London, 85 to 9. l Ashes had advanced. Cotton continued very buoyant, but the businews done was moderate. The advices by the Niagara disappointed holders, but their effect was counteracted by the Southern accounts, which give a very unfavourable statement of the crop. The receipts are reported to have been diminishing rapidly. For flour an advance of 10o. had been established, owing to light stocks and an isproved demand for shipment. Grain was without material change. Iron wvas quiet, but firm. Tobacco was qxuet. F<reights to Great Britain were lower, with only a moderate business. At New Orleans on the 14th cotton was firm. SHIPPITG INTELLIGENCE. The Elisa Thornton, the Isaac Webb, the Enterprise, the Middlesex, the tilarvest Queen, the J. A. Westervelt, and the Willian Tspscott, hence; the Marmion and the Tornado, from ayvre; tho Ieontino, from Bremen; and the Margaret Evans, from London, had arrived at Now York. The Englikh bark Mexicans went ashore near Vera Craz and would probably become a loss, with a portion of the 'cargo; no lives lost.

THE. 'WATEBCOLZO Y1C LS0IBi It bas generally -been t~ho custom, for the" ~th or" WatrColour Society ito .open a wree before tha "Old."' Yesterday they both4~pen'ed tegathetr and!1 challenged compariaon with mer.o t'han owmae frankness.| The " Old" Society certainly hu the best of it. Not only are the veterans Qf the body at their for.mer level, but the xnore- recent member3 are artaining their energies to the utmost, and the re-I sinlt is a collectionI in which there ae many ccuspiououa beauties, and almost every article of 'which i worthy of respectful contemplation. M£r. David Cox, advancing in years, has also gone a lttle further in his eccentricities, and his splashy landscapes are alnioat caricatured by a rocky comnpoaition that is as near ag poesible-aviewof nothing. But there is 'the same dashing reckles character and t.e same comreiand of effect that has'distinguished his earlier productions, aid those who havve admired him once.will admire him still. Ar. W.: flunt still produces his very natural studies of peasant life, and his yet more natiral studies of fiirit ana flowers. Mr. 'rederick Tayler, whom it is a plattlrde to call the "Ladseer of water-colour," ,ends torth into the world his troop of gillies, and de0thounds and Highland drovers, who seem to be elbowing out those gallant Cavaliers of the last cen ' tatit once monopolized his penciL Mr. F. W. Toiam, who adheres to " humanities," is quite equal to himself in the "Zonave's Story of the -!sormewhat feebly painted, it is true, but full of life both as regards the historian, *ho is overflowing withhis narrative, and the, listeners, old. and young, who are drinking it in. Mr. H. P. Riviere, who used to confinehimself to small sketches of Irish life, ever replete with humour, expands his vision, and gives cottage interiors, plewsantly and characteristically peopled. Mr. Oakley, whose View of, humble personages was always amiable, is unclsanging and unchangeable. The floral honours of the screen are still shared (with Mr. Hunt) by the exquisite fruit and flowers of Mr. V. Bartholomew. While the generality of the artiits are chiefly employed in maintaining their ancient footing, and in making each exhibitioni look as much as possible like that of the year preeedieg, there are some who labour to achieve a distinctive sucoe, and aim at other merit than that of being just as good as ever..- At the head of these we may place Mr. Cartl Haag, whose head of a "Roman Pilgrlm"' is the most striking work of the collection. The eye weak with age, the redness of the htmds, the veins about the temple, are finished to the extreme of minuteness; every hair of the head aud beard is separately drawn. And yet in all this minuteness there is nothing that fritters away the general effect, but thewhole picture comes out a perfect symbol of trustful old age. There are plenty of Southern peasants, lit up with the usuaf glow, to testify to the industry of Mr. Haag, but this study of a head is the one pieee that marks him out for the present season. However, the drawing that will be most talked about is the "Hhareem life!' (we used to say "Baaren)" in our youth) of Ir. J. F. Lewis. A portly lady, reclining on a couch, is attended by a female servant, whose head, through its proximity to a looking-glass, is exhibited twice over. On the details of decoration, on the ornaments of the dremes, on the ornaments of the wall, en the foldc of drapery, on the separate brilliants of jewelry the painter has gone to work irth the elaborate minuteness of a carver in ivory. And when the work is done, what ia the result? A picture that stands out from the rest, because it has the smooth, flat, highly-finished appearance of a Chinese screen, with all the artistic vnrtues proper to the Celestial Empire. Mr. Burton, who started into celebrity some two or three years since, ha again achievod a striking picture, a "Faust's first sight of Margaret." The figures comprising the seducer, his vietim, and the tempter are drawn with great vigour, and the girEsh innocence of Gretchen's face is happily conceived. But -the personages considered in relation to each otiher are less satisfactory than when taken separately. Faust, tlough a good study of drawing and foreehortening, is but a coarse representation of the libertine sage, and Mephistopheles is insignificant. A remarkably fine landscape'i)y Mr. C. Branwhite -" Kilgerran Castle, ;.orth Wales "-may be mentioned among the notabilitiei of the exhibition. Here all is rml and solid. The dark mas&es of the background truly recede into the distauce; the water whichoccnpies the foregronnd s as glassywater can be; the distinction between rilestiou and the thing reflected is neither above nor below the leanes of nature. Some pleasant pictures, in which the figures are drawn somewhat after the fashion of Mir. Cattermole, and the composition is somewhat after the fashion of Mr. Wingfield, are painted by Mr. Nash. A fencing-bout, on a broad lawn, in the presence of lazy spectators, male and female, aU attired in smart cavalier fashion, has been hastily executed, but is gay and lively to look upon. The " New" Society is, on the whole, disappointing. Here, rather than among the productions of the elder body, have we hitherto been accustomed to expect conspicuous works. When the " old" societarians had settled down, each into his owa vocation, and were content to reproduce, one his landscape, another his equestrian or canine group, after a firmly-established type, one looked for indications of restless ambition to the " new" competitors, and a disposition t6 cast off antiquated restraints. This year it is to the "old" society that we must look for the chief instances of daring, while the "new" one shows a strong disposition to relapse into mediocrity, not comparable to the average level at the east end of PallmalL The landscapes of MIr. W. Bennett are still prominent among those vigorous works that are divided by a broad line of demarcation from those productions of the drawingmnster school which are numerically - important at the exhibitions of both Eocieties, and which, with their smooth cleanliness, will always find a large body of admirers. Mr. D. M'Kewan yet revels in his granite rocks and his waterfalls, seeming less at home amid woodland scenery and architecture. Mr. W. Telbin's broad Venetian view, with the buildings so distinctly shown, yet so naturally melting into the distance, exhibits the comprehensive grasp and feeling for atmospberic effect by which the works of that meritorious artist are always distinguished. The landscape department also gains strength from the productions of MIr. S. Cook, an artist not of long standing in the annals of the society, whose sea views are masterpieces of quiet truth. But, on the other hand, Mr. Vacher, who used to bring back such gorgeous reminiscetces of Venice, and make the walls glow with his warmth of colour, has been sobered down by a visit to Algeria, whereof he paints much, and has lost a great deal of his pristine vigour. M1r. Absolon remains where he was, happier in single figures than in compositions, making his people all alike, and dressing them as agreeable relics of "O11l England." Sir. Corbould is as minutely laborious as usual, reducing to miniature smoothness the coarsest specimens of humauity, and conferring the nicest delicacy on the grimmest visage. To produce the mass of faces aud bodies intended to represent a Prussian fair on the King's birthday, with the ordi- nary measure of conviviality heightened by an allusion to Great Britain, a world of labour must have been expended. Nor has it been thrown away. In spite of the miniature levelthere are humour and character in several of the countenances, and the faculty of invention is developed to a surpriing extent. But the picture lacks a focus; the faces vie with each other m distinctness, as in those works of art that professedly derive their value from the accuracy of the portraits they contain; and the tye of the spectator wanders in vain for a place whereon to rest. Melancholy indeed are the short- comings of MIr. Webuert once one of the most pro I mising artists of the Trew Society. Who could recognize the creator of the " Captive" in the mob . f juvenile caricatures that surround honest " John Pounds," the founder of ragged schools? Mr. Hlen Warren, the president, produces a large picture, as usual. This time the scene is a street in Cairo, with a miarriage procession aniA all itb apiurtepances. The circumstances are carefully wrought ont, the drapery is executed with the artist's ordi: nary correctnes, the wlhole work is perfectly finished after its kind, hut the general effect Is weak. Mr. L. Iaghes drawings are still the most imroltant works of the exhibition. His anecdote of the painter Cornelis Vroonr. it not equal in foroe to some of his eArlier monastic subjects; but the j Ir PubUo Uetter Writer" is a mos felicitous approi priatou of a local pei-uiarity to the ptrposes of cowpyoitiou.

The Grand Duke will attendbefore his departure a great diplomatic dinner, to be given by Count Walewki, nisr for Foreign Aars. The warm weather lvblch prevailed in Paria at the latter end of the last and the beginning of the prepent week has been succeded by extreme cold. The thermometer, which on Sunday lat marked 23 deg.

According to accounts received at the Observatory by telegraph, the thermometer marked yesterday at Strasburg S deg. 8-10; at Lyons, 3 deg. 1-10; at Toinerre, 2 deg. 2-10 ; at Be?angon, 2 deg. 7-10 Rleaumur. The Empress Dowager of Russia sailed from Nice on the afternoon of the 21st inst. on board the Russian steam-frigate Olaff for Civita Vecchia. A great proportion of the population of Nice assembled on the quay to cheer Her Majesty on her departure. Dhuring the six months she passed at Nice she omitted no opportunity to relieve the distressed. On leaving, she deposited 20,000. with the municipality for charitable purposes, and 6,000f. to assist in establishing a savings-bank. The folowing private telegraphic despatches have "ST.

How longhe intends staying in that capital is not said. Price Daniel arrived in Paris without having been inv.ted by the French Government. It is, however, curently reported and believed that be was encouraged to take that step by the French Consul at Soutari (Albania), who, from having been an officer In the French army, and having served in Algeria, soon acquired considerable influence in Montenegro, and has, perhaps, contributed not a little to raise the hopes and pretensions of Prince Daniel. Though uninvited, the Prince was yet very well received here-so well, indeed, that it was for some time thought he had found' encouragement, so far as his views in the East 'were concerned,from no less a personage than theEmperor of the French. The news received from Montenegro, the hostility of Russia, the coldness of Austria, the decidedlyfavourable attitude of England towards the Porte in theMontenegro question,and the conviction on Prince Daniel's mind that Queen Victoria would not receive him if he visited London except on the introduction of the Sultan's Ambassador atthe Court of St. James, had tconsiderably Lmodified his notions of his own importance, and cooled the ardour of his hopes. He thought that it would be advantageous for him to come to an understanding with the Porte, through the intervention of the Turkish Ambassador in Paris, and he resolved on seeking an interview with Mehemed Djemil Bey. For that purpose he addreEsed himself to a diplomatist whose long experience and great knowledge of everything relating to the East are well known and appreciated, and who he thought, would offer his own house as the pLace of meeting between the Illyrian chieftain and the Turkish Ambassador. The diplomatist, however, pointed out so strongly the inconvenience, and indeed the impossibility of such an arrangement, and at the same time demonrtrated so clearly the advantage of an understanding between Montenegro and the Porte, that he succeeded in overcoming Prince Daniel's hesitation, and obtained a promise that he would pay a visit to Mehemed Bey, which promise he fulfied. Neither this visit, nor that which was paid in return by the Turrkish Ambassador, put an end to the difficulties between Montenegro and the Porte; but it was the commencement of negotiations which promiseafavourable issue forboth parties. His intention, when he left Paris, was, as soon as he resumes the direction of affairs in his country,to send his brother to Constantinople, for the purpose of settling with the Porte the question of the limits of his principality. One of the first consequences of such an arrangement will be to put an end to the fierce and bloody forays for which the wild tribes of these countries have acquired an unfortunate notoriety. Prince Daniel left Paris in the hope; and, it Is said, with the promise, of support from the French Government in this negotiation, which promises to lead to abetter understanding between the chieftains and the Sultan, whom Prince Daniel has at last recognized as his suzerain. This recognition is for the advantage of the Prince and equally sO for the Ottoman Government. During his inspection of the Prench fleet at Toulon the GrandDuke Constantine wasinformedthat among the officers was a midshipman who had been taken prisoner by the Russians at Kinburn. He requested that the young man should be presented to him, which was done, and the Duke decorated him with a military cross. He further requested Admiral Trehouart, the Admiral commanding the feet, to pernit the young man to act as his aide-de-camp durig his stay in France. The Grand Duke, since his arrival at Toulon, has given proofs that he is not only a practical seaman, but an accomplished scholar. When on board the Bretagne, the Admiral's ship7 he maintained an animated discussion on the merits of her machinery, which showed that he Is an excallent engineer. It is proposed to place a marble tablet in the Council Chamber of the Municipality with an incripton commemorative of the visit of the Grand Duke Constantine. Preparations are making at the polygon of Vincennes for ex;periments with artillery, at which the Grand Duke will be present. HIis Imperial Highness has expresed a wish to bepre gent during his stay ln Pari at a sitting of the Academy of Sciences. hea members of the military eommission sent by tile Emperor of Ruisia to visit the military establishments anId fortre In France are now in Paris. The commissioners are Lieutenant-Colonel von Behrens, of the Staff; Colonel Anikoff, of the Egneers ; and Lieutenant-Colonel Albinski of the Artillery. They have been anchorizbd by the Emperor to visit Ageria, whither they wFill proceed aftes concluding their mison in France, It formedprt of the mission of the First Almoner, theo Bishop of Nanny, while at Rome, to support the letter of -ih 3mperor to0the Pop tor obt the restoration to teir pshes o the prie plc unider ierdjct by the Bishop of M9oulns, and to negotiate, the tion of tho.prelatehiumself. The First Almoner as niot, I believe, succeeded to the extent desire& I cannot say for certain whether His Holibess will-ca3n upon the Bishop torsMign, but the Papal &uncio in Paris requires as a prelimunary step that the pr4et shall address a oommunication to their Bishop epxreing " repentance" for their conduct. The priests, not being cosocious of having co tted asn of uch magnitude as to require rXentcnce, nor believing themselves criminals for having appealed to a lega tribunal for protection against oppression, and considering that they violated no moral or reli8ious duty, have declined to do so. They are, however) ready to address a letter expreive of their "regret" at having defended themselves agst their ecclesiastical superior with too much warmth. 4" Repentance "1 is a change of mind or a converion from sin, and sin they deny havtig committed. "Regret". is a feeling of vexation for some past incident, and, whether they really feel regret or not, they are at any rate prepared to say so. In the meantime the Government can do.no more. The Council of State has found that there was an abuse of authority on the part of the Bishop, but no further pnmishment can they inflict, and the censured prelate cannot be removed by the temporal power from his diocess, unless some ultraGallican bishop turns up who is as offensiveto Rome as the extravagant Ultramontanism of M. Dreu:y Brez6 is to the temporal Government, when a reciprocal sacifce, as in a late instance, would be agreed to; but a solution seems for the present very difficult. M. Soyer left Paris to-day for London, on bis return from the Crimea, being his first visit to England since bis departure thence on his miS3ion to the East. Sinceehe quitted the seat of war hehas travelled in various parits of the continent for the purpose of collecting materials for a future wok, which will comprise the principal natiJnai dishes most in vogue in various countries. Twice M. Soyer had ihe honour of an interview with the Emperor Louis Napoleon at the Tuileries. He has been deputed, moreover, to visit the Fourneaux de VImpgratwe, or soup-kitchens They are 68 in nimber, and are~ established iM every quarter of Paris, as well as in the suburbs. Independently of being under the patronage of theit Majesties, they are subject to the Inspection of the Prefect of the Seine the provisions are supplied by the supervisor of the MaUes et marc1hs, and the management, cooking, and distribution are confided to the Sisters of Charity. Nothingis givengratls, but the soup and other articles of food are sold under cost price, thus affording great relief to the recipient:s. In he report x Soyer submitted to the Emperor he spoke in high terms of these institutions, and proposed several Improvements {or adoption on the reopening of these kitchens next witer. He aLso intends to introduce aseveral new and cheap receipts for the benefit of the working classes. BYe remarked how beneficial it would be if this system were adopted by all nationsas in the winter season, and especially in large manufae'Furing towns, thousands of artisans are annually thrown out of employment for a time. The Aicitia, a Dutch ga31iot, from Cette for Amsterdam, has been forced to take shelter in the creek of Amelador, near.Vinaroz, on the coast of Yalencia, having been chased by a brigantine, supposed to be a Greek pirate. iAccording to. the deposition of the captain of the .Aiulcitia and the declaration of the crew, the galliot, which sailed from Cette on the 28th of March, being off the coast of Spain on the 8th of April, perceived a brigantine, carrying sixt guns, whicht chafsed the Amicitia, and fired twro shtots at her. Other ships having appeared, the brigantine sailed away, but returnued again, and for two days chased the Dutchma. The latter succeeded in getting into the creek above mentioned, where the captain Jumped ashore, together with his crew.- AUSTRIA (moM ou or OOV u v roRsPnnr.) VIENNA Awrn 24. The Oesferietvchischc Zeihtng of this morning has a leader, in which it is said that the breach between AusEtria and Russia " is not so wide as it was a short time ago," but I kn\ow that the very reverse is the case. Russia and Austria hate each other 'with such a deadly hatred that they would probably come to blows if they wrere not both sO mniserably poor. So jealous are the Austriawns of the attentionts paid by France to RUESsia and her sons, that they are now endeavourlng to persuade thtemselves that the reception given to the Grand Duke Constantine will be exactly the [same as that which the Archdu}ke Ferdinand Maximilian met with int the month of September, 1855. There canl be no hope of a renewval of' the diplomatic relations between Austria and Sardinia for some time to come, but both Governments are equally desirous to avoid any measures wihich could widen the breach. The attention of the Viennese is at present almost exclus,ively directed to financial matters, as a general impression prevails that there will be a tremendous crisis if any new indus#e stock is brought into the market during the year 185Z. Baron Bruck has been repeatedly told by experienced financiers he is going ahead too fast; but he is of sulch a sanguine temperament that he seems to fancy everything to which he puts his hand must succeed. Another concession has been granted by the Emperor for a railroad from Steinbraick, by way of Agram, to Sissek; but It is not probable that any new railroad shares w3ll be issued during the present year. It is now seriously debated in the haighest administratlve cirles whether it would not be advisable officially to inform the panlestricken public that the shares of the East Gallician. Francis Joseph, and sundry other projected railroads, will not be issued for the next 15 or 18 months, but the matter has, not yet been brought before the Emperor. People lament that the National Loan, which bears 5 lper cent, interest, payable in silver, is at 84k, but it is by no means astonishinlg that such is the case. It was firmly believed that the payment of the last two instalments of the Credit Bank would be postponed, but when, a month age, the last but one was called in, the public were obliged to sell National Loan scrip in order to be able to meet their engagements. It is als whispered that the Minister of Finance sells, National Loan scrip which has not yet been paid up, in order to avoid making a new loan at such an unfavouzable moment. The State balancesheet for 1856 has, not yet been published, although the "<administrative" year ends on the Slst October.y The report that the Austrian army is being reduced is incorrect. That great numbers of men are senlt to their homes is perfectly true, but tShe gaps are filled up by the recruits raised during the last two months. PRUJSSIA. (IncH oun OWNcX PoisDEiPOr.>) The Prussian Ministry has received another defeat on a fncequestion. Their bill for raislnY meprceo sltfrm12to15talrsfo cskn thn ple of Bait froma 12 to 1S th a-ler's-for a, cako 405 lb. was thrown out In the House of Notables last Thursday, by a majority of 95 against 21. This result was confidently foreseen from the moment the committee of that Ilouse had decided to recommend the rejection of the bill by a majority of 13 against 1; and in the House of Deputies also, where the C-overnment can reckon confidently on an overwhelming majority for any pro- position except one that takes money out of the people's pockets, the Government had only been able by the greatest exertions to save it by a very trifling majority. The House of Notables cannot be too thankful to the Ministry for affording it this very cheap opporty of diminising its own load of unopuaity in the country by rejecting a bill which.the nation at large looked on with the greatest dislike, as tending to increase the burdens ef the poor, instead of laying them dn the richer classes, who enjoy in this country a degree of comparative immunity from taxation. In addition to this bill for raising the price of salt, which is a State monopoly, the Government has also had its projet of laying a fresh duty on houses and tenements thrown out In the House of Deputies this sesion, and, however desirable it may be that the Government should be provided with increased means for the greatly ex- tended wants of the State, it can only be desired by' every well-wisher of the country that they may cpntinue to be defeated on every project they may introduce for a financial palliative, seeing thatit is the entire system that requires alterstion, if the country is to have a fair Chance of competing with othelr, The present syst eleti for th'e greatest burden oftaaintepo,heabui,ad e p7roductive classes, whileitiesyav allbut untouched the rich, the idle, mir~d 'then conlirg clffi te frt(#jes consumere nati ^ ' * -- lt is no iecret that t3ie diibdiy proposal of tfia Paris Conference for settingte ft poition of Neucbitel was received here in abstraet by tele. graph Itat Monday evening, and at full length by despatch soon afterwards, butI cannot takeuponmyself to state to you in what this fnal proposal oonsists.

Prince Alfred left Geneva last week on his way through Switzerland to'Gotha, where he is going to spend a few weels on a visit to his uncle, the reigning Duke. On leaving - Geneva he presented the.

Some of the Swiss papers penrsit in making him helr to the throne of Great 13ritain, call him Prince of Wales, and demsribe hiM; "as a very young-looking man, witha handsome counte. nance." .The Leipsic Easter fair, wlhich begins next MIon. day, the 27th inst.> promises very favourably. Gireat numbers of porchasers from the Danubian Prnci4. palities and 'Poland have already arrved in the Saxon capital, ana the stocks of cloth, leather, and other staple articles are reported to be insufflcient to meet the demand, Prics,iconsequence,are generally,very high; andmoney at 6 per cent. The cloth manufacturers of Prussa and Saxony have for many months past been very advelyemployed, and have received more orders than they coud execute. Since the peace with Ru , ana the abundaint harvest of last year, an extraordinary impulse has been given to the manufacturing energiLeaof Germany. An a proof of this it may be mentioned that the entire quantity of goods, whether German orforeignu, brought on sale to the Leipsic fairs in 1856 was 568,237 quxntals, whereas on an average of the-fiveprevious years it did not exceed 387,003 quintals. For British manufactures especialy cotton and woollen yarns, the year 1866wavery brilliant one -the entire quantity brought to the Leipsic market Is estimated at 127,121 quitals, being an increase of above 400 per cent. on the average of the previous five years, which ranged at 23,656 quintals. There seems every -prospect of the continuance of this favourable state of things, at least during the present year. This large importation of English yarns shows how. far the German spinning establishments ae from being able to meet the home demand, and that the protective duties imposed by the Zoliverein on half-manufactured articles have, so far as the German produce is concerned, hitherto failed in the result anticipated.
EQUALIZATION OF TRB SUGAB DUTIES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMhES. Sir,-Will you allow me a brief apace in your columns to call attention to the sugar duties as now levied, in the hope that the subject may receive that discussion, both in and out of the ouse, to which Its importance to the great consuming classes of this country entitles it. At present there is a diffierential scale of duty, varying from 12E. Sd. to 18s.. 4d. per cwt., dependent on quality. My obiect iis to show that this differential scale should be abolished, and in its stead one uniform rate of duty levied on a31 sugars alike. The main objections to the present system are,1. That-the producer abroad Is indifferent as to. quality the graduated scale of duty has compelled hnn to abandon all attempts to improve quality,, or rather he now only tries to produce what wilL be assessed, when imported here, at the lower rates of dauty. The sliding scale, therefore, instead of proving a stimulus to the manufacture of the finer sugars, is positively a premium upon the badness of production, and the public has orly to thank thie pernicious system of duty for the coarse, gritty, impure article which the masses consume. 2. The denomination of the quality, and consequently its value, is assigned by the Custom-house officer, and varies not onlyin thedifferentports, bub in the different docks of the same port, and but too often according to the caprice or fancy of the officer. This is quite unfar to the merchant, who can never tell until the suga& is landed what duty is to be charged, and scarcely a cargo asrives upon which a difference of opinion as to value does not arise between the merchant or his broker and the offacer. The judgment of the officer is conclusive, unless the merchant determines to appeal, and should he do so the following, is the process to which he is subjected:-He must first petition the Commissioners of Customs; if they support the ruling of the officer, as is too often, the case, his next step is a further petition to the Lorcd of Her Majesty's Treasury, and not until he has exhausted these steps is he entitled, as a last resort, to apply to the regular legal tribunals of the country. I need not say, Sir, that injustice is often submitted to, rather than recourse had to such cumbrous and dilatory machinery, though instances are not wanting where, after the appeal has teached the Treasury, and the Lords have at fist- supported the finding of the officers below, they have subsequently reversed their decision, rather than allow the case to be exposed before one of the ordinary courts of law. 3. The present scale acts as a protection to the refiners in this country by preventing the refining of sugars abroad. This fact,is readily explained thus: The colonial refiner cannot compete with the British, because, while the latter pays the low duty before refining, the former, who must refine before the duty is paid, subjects his work to the higher duty. The effect of this is to throw the whole trade into the hands of the British refiners-a powerful body, who thus regulate prices. This is so opposed to the first principles of free trade, which have received almost universal sanction In England, that It is unnecessary to maintain them here. 4. The examination of the cargoes by the Custom. house officer is fraught with delay and vexation to the merchant, and with a large increase of worldng charges to the revenue, from the number of officers necessary to ascertain the qualitie Every package on arrival is sampled, and if even a single bag of better quality is found in a large cargoa matter of firequent occurrence, and voidable by reason of its having drained during the voyage more than theothers-that single jbag is charged with the higher duty, and the merchant loses not only the weight from drainage, but also the difference iu the duty. If these objections be just, as I think a discussion on the subject, which it is my wish to promote, will readily prove them to be, the remedy is a simple one. Lot one uniform duty-say 15s., 16s., or even 17s. per cwt., be charged on all sugas alike, with permission to the British refiner to refine in bond for home consumption. The amount of duty is not complained of, provided the rate wereuniform; and the result would be fair play to the merchant and grower, free trade between the foreign and British refiner, a certain increase of revenue to the Exchequer, and, above all, a better and cheaper article to the public. These important objects I ask you to assist us in securing; and I have the honour to be, Sir, srat You obdiet hmbl srvant.

He was of opinion with tha L-ords Justices that it wAs not, inasmuach as it was just as probable that 3Mrs Emmott gyav the money to her husband, and that he put it into the business In addition, thiere was nothiing to-show that John Emmott ,did' not bring into the partnership some portion of capital,, which negative it was necesary to Prove ifMrs EMmeGtt's theory wasetoxtan.d.

The bill was filed by creditors to impeach a voluntary settlement, the parties beneficially interested being the fatber and mother and two children, then infants, but who had since attained 2L The family were resident in Germany, and the plaintiff succeeded in serving the father and mother, and the bill was taken confes- against them. The plaintiff endeavoured to tak the same course with respect to the two children, and thought he had done so with respect to one, Elizabeth, and an anpearance was entered for her, but did not suoceed as to the other. The cause came on, and a decree was made for preliminary inquiries on the authority of a case at the Rolls, but when the decree came to be drawn up it turned out that the pro. ceedings against Elizabeth were irregular, and the plaintiff moved ezparte to dismiss-the bill against her, and the order was-made, the bill having been dismissed against the other child, but the registrar found great difficulty, and the trustees applied to discharge the order, and the drawing up of the decreewas'suspended. Mr. W. H. TERR.ELL then moved to discharge the two orders dismissing the bill gainst the two children. Mr. Baily and 3r. Hobhonse appeared for the trustees. The VICE.CE"CELLoR, having taken time to consider the point, said that he could not deny the plaintiff such relief as the nature of the case enabled him to et, His right to relief as against the father and mother could not be refused, but it need not be prosecated against the chlldren, for thero was no reasen why the settlement should not be Impeachled quoad the life interest of the father and mother without the reversionar interest of the childrern bein called in question. His Honour had consulted Mr. Wood and Mr. Munro, the registrars, upon the point, and the result was that he should direct the order dimissing the bill against Elizabeth, the child, to be drawn up, and let the decree be drawn up, the plaintiff waving all relief against the children. If the matter had been a res intVra the result would have been different. (Before V'ice-Chancellor Sir ToIHn STUAART.) MOSES V. BAYLIS. This was a bill for the specific performance of an agreement by the defendant to assist the plaintiff in procuring, and in worldng when obtained, a patent for the discovery by the latter of an invention for propelling ships through the water without the aid of steam, and independently of the wind, by means of animals, it being proposed by the plaintiff to use horses and elephants for propelling large ships. By an agreement dated the 19th of IAgust, 1856, in consideration of the defendant bearing the expenses of causing the plaintifl's invention to be patented, the latter agreed to give up to the defendant one-half of the profits of the proposed patent. On the 23d of Augot the plaint tiff obtained provisional registration for his invention under the Patent Law Amendment Act (1852), bat he did not procure his patent within six months from the 23d of August last, as directed by that Act. The bill, which was filed on the 12th of December, 1856, alleged that the defendant refused to incuror defray any expense in relation to obtaining the patent, and prayed for the soecific performance of the agreement before stated. In the course of the plaintiff's cross-examination he said " I did not tell the defendant how, many horses it would take to move a vessel of 2.000 tons, or how many elephants." It did not appear how the horses and elephants were to be applied to propel the vessels. On the 20th of Febrt6ry the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant of his intention to move for a decree, and on the 25th of February, 1857, the plaintiff commenced his action at law against the defendant to recover damages for the loss of his patent by reson of the alleged default of the defendant to supply binm with money to obtain the same. On the 12th of March the defendant obtained the usual order at the Rolls for the plaintiff to make his election whetherhe would proceed with this suit or with the action at law, and, the plaintiff having elected to proceed at law, the present 'bill was ordered to be dismissed with costs. A motiou to dis. charge that order as well as a motion for a decree now came on together. It was contended on the defendant's behalf that the plaintiff had not lost all right to his patent by reason of his not having taken it oat within six months from the 23d of August, 1856 t for that by the terms of the Patent Law A mendment Act ne migt, on showing a proper case, obtain a patent notwithstanding the expiration of that perio d'; that the ent case: was one simply for damages, the contract sought t be enforced being merely one to sRxUtF mloney, and that no relief cold be given ieuity - at the invention was sb palpably'uselea, that'this C%unst would not interfere to enforce anl agreement to supply funds to patent it; and that the defendant bad committred no breah' of hi agreement. M. Malins and Mr. Beaumont were for the plaintiff, ana Mr. Wigramn and Mr. Rogers for the defendant. The VICH oELop said that this suit and the action at lawwere not' brought In respect of the same subjectmatter. This suit was Instituted to enforce the specific performance of the agroement of the 2th of Aug*s' 1856, and' the' action was brought to recover damages In oDa.- uence of its being impossible to perform the agreement.

Rule refused. I AIGH V. OUSSY AND A?0OTHYR. This action was brought on an attorney's bill, to which it was pleaded that the plaintiff had not delivered any bill of his fees, charges, and disbursements, as required Iby the 37th section of the 6th and 7th of Victoria ap. 73. At the trial the plaintiff obtained a verdict, but subBe. quently rule was granted to set aside the verdct, and to enter a nonsuit, or a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the statute had not been complied with. One question raised was whether it was necessary for the plaintiff to state the wticular court in which certain businss vas done, or whether it was sufficient if it appeared to have been done in one of the superior courts; and with respect to certain other items it was oontended there was not sufficient information to enable the party to take the opinion of another attorney as to whether the charges were reasonable The defendant contended, upon the anthority of a decision of the Court of Exchequer, that where the particular court was omitted to be mentioned, even in a single instance, that wa suflicient to defeat the plaintifs claim, and to entitle the defendant to a verdict. Mr. REw showed cause against the rule, which was ~supported by Mlr Manisty. Lord CAmPBELL said be wa of opinion that the rule ought to be discharged, on the ground that it must be considered that the plaintiffhad deliveroc a bil, in a sufficient time, of his fees, chargec, and disbursements. The statute only required thatsucha bill should be delivered. and no mere; but it had been held that the bill should contain suflicientinformation to enablethe partytomal-e inquiry as to the reasonableness of the charges Lordship thought that that had been done in this ease, in accordance with decisions of this Court and the Court of Common Plea. But it was said there was a decision of the Court of Exchequer which conflicted with those decisions, and which entitled the defendant to succeed in the action. His Lordship reviewed those decisions at some length, and observed t;hat he thought all the necesry informatio n wsgiven in the billbefore the Court. With respect to that part of the bill which relates to business done in court, he (lord Cam pbell adhered to his opinion that it was suficlelt if the bill showred that it was done in one of the superior courts, without stating the particular court. Formerly a different scale of taxation prevailed in the different court, but now there was one uniform scale, Mr. Justice WIoHTYAN Mr. Justice ERLE, and Mr. Justice Cov;ompToN severally expressed their opinions to the same effect, andall concurred in the opinion that if there was one bad item in the bill that was no reason why a plaintiff should not recover for the good items, which might amount to several thousand pounds. Rule discharged. ALDIS V. HBBERT. lr. Pow=Vr, moved for a rule calling on the defendant to show cause why there should not be a new trial in tbis case. The action was brought to recover damages for an assault and turning the plaintif out of her lodgings in the defendan's house. The defendant pleaded the general issue, Mad .that theplaintiffe irsasaulted the defendant, It apeard the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Wightman, at the sittings in this present term, that the plaindfthe a si,nle noman, occupied two rooms in tbe defendant' house, andthat there had been differences beteen the patie, the defendant's wife, and plaintiff's mother. In the eult a quareland scuffe took place on the staircase, and the defendant turned the plaintiff and her mother out into the street at night. The learned counsel contended that, though the defendant might be justified in turning the mother out, as she did notlive with her daughter,' he had no authority to turn the plaintiff herasf out, for she occupied apart. ments in the house, and had a right tohbe on the stairta Lord CAMPBELL said the plaintiff had a right to use the stairs, hut if she was committing a breach of the peace the case was different. Mr. POWELL submitted that in thatoase the defendant ought to have sent for thepolice to remove her, or to have adopted some other means. Lord CA1'IPBELL said the Court wOUld confer with the learned judge. (His Lordship had left the court.) WOODLAND V. PEAY.

COURT OF COMMON PLTA.s, WEST3mNSTm ArPn 27. IZaisngs in Banco, EatstcZermrm) Thin was Bpecial Paper-day, and the Court was occupied all day with eearing a techncal argument of no public interest relative to the service of a sumons on the agert of a corporation in Ireland. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at Wesdminster, before Mr. Jutstice WinLrAs and Common Juries.) The timo of the Court was occupied during the greater portion of the day by the trial of the first cause on the list -" Orchard and Another v. Simpson"-wbich wvas an action brought to recover a balance alleged to be due from the defendant to the plaintiffs for the construction of a large tent of the value of nearly 2,0001. The defendant, who paid 361. into court, is the well-known lessee of Cremorne-gardens, and the tent in question was the one underneath which the famous floral exhibition in Ashburnham. park, adjoining those gardens, and at which Her Majesty and other members of the Royal family were present, in June last, took place. It was also used for the fite of the Licensed Victualers, and for the dinners given by various other companies and societies. With the excepeton of that which may be derived from the above facts the details of this case presented no features of sufficient interest to demand a report, and consisted simply of disputes touching the items oW the account. It was urged by the defendant, among other things, that he had already paid enough to satisfy the legal demands of the plaintiff8; that some of the work was badly done- and that an item of lOl. charged for flags ought not to have been charged, inasmuch as the plaintiffe badasked to be allowed to furnish those decorations for nothing as an advert? ement for themselve. The Jury after hearing the case and the summing up of the learued Judge, found a verdict for the plamtiffsdamage, 67l.-with liberty to the defendasit to move on point raised as to the construction of the contract between the parties. MIr. flardingo S. Giffard and Mr. Josiah Rees were counsel for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Montagu Chambers, Q.C., and MIr. Wordsworth appeared for the defendant.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER, MONDAY, APRIL 27. LYN11ON V. RTANY)NRTTr.r (Sittin7 in Baneo.) tXhis was an action brought against the town clerk of Birmingham under the Birmingham Improvement Act, 1861. The queston, which was raised upon demurrer to a plea, and aeso to a replication, was as to the obligation upon the town council of the borough, who are the commiEsioners appointed by the Act to carry ita object into execution, to remove ashes, dust, andrubbiehproducedfromamanufactory. The Act,which was psssed" for the better draining, lighting, Paving, supplying with water, and otherwise improv. ing tho borough," incorporated, among other sections of the " Towns Improvemcnt Clauses Act, 1847," the 87tb, by which it is enacted that the council " shall cause all the dust, ashes, and rubbish to be carried away from the houses and tenements of the inhabitants." It appeared by the pleadings that the rubbish which the plaintiff complained the town-council had allowed to accumulate was dust, ashes, and rubbish, the refuse of coal, slack, and other combustible materials used in a mianufactory of spades and edge-tools called the Minerva Works, in Faze.ey-street, Birnmgham. It also aIppeared that the plaintiff was an inhabitant of the house, in the sense that he occupied a dwelling-house therein for the purpose of having his meals prepared, and by a servanit who, with his family, resided therein. Mbr. M. SmiTir, Q.s. (with whom were M1r. Macaulay, Q.C., Mr. J. A. Russell, andMr. Norman) argued the case on behalf of the plaintiff. The defendant's case was arqued by Sir F. TszsSoRn, Serjeant Hayes and Mr. Field being with him. The COURT, without saying whether an action could be maintained against the council of the borough for not removing refuse,-a point which was not raised,-were clearly of opinion that the refuse of the non-removal of which the plaintiff complained was not ashes, dust, and rubbish which the council were bound to remove. Upon tho construction of the 87th section, and other sections of the Act, the Court expressed'a clear opinion that the obligation was only to remove the dust ashes, and rubbish of inhabited dwellinghouses. That although it might in cases where a fire was used for dornestic and likewise for manufacturng purposes he impossible to tell how much of it arose from the domestic and how much from the manufacturing use, yet where it was obvious that the great bulk of the refuse arose from a manufaotory the Act was not meant to apply thereto. The Court therefore gave judgment for the defendant. SMALLEY V. THE BLACKBURN RAILWAY COM'AINY. This was a special case, raising a question as to whether an award under a reference of an action of ejectmient included the mesne proits, so as to preclude the plaintif from afterwards sUin3g lroi them. The lands in respect of which the ejectment was broughthadbeentaken by the defendants for the purposes of their railway. The questionturned upon matters of a purely technical description, and after Mear.~ L (with whom was hfr. Hill, Q.C.) for the plain. tiff, without calling upon Mr. Edward James, Q.C., who, with Mr. Boden, appeared for the defendant. The COURT gave judgment for the defendant.
INSOLVEANT DEBTOBS' COURT, IpriZ 27. IN RE MILLIADS GIRSON. (Before Mr. 007nmisioner PmLLiSr.) 'his insolvent, who had been a bootmaker in Red Lion. street, applied to be discharged. Mr. DoWsE supported. Mr. Bruton, the well-known comic vocalist, opposed in person, and complained that in October, 1854, lie answered an advertisement. which led to an interview with the insol. vent, who described himself as a dealer in diamonds, in temporary want of 1001., for which he could give good security. Mr. Bruton having saved a little money, and having 1001. whicb he intended to devote to the purchase of an annuity for his mother's benefit, agreed to lend the monoy. At an interview for concluding the transaction he was shown a lease of a house, 17, Southampton-buildings, Holborn, which was to be deposit4d as secuity, hut after he had actually handed over the money he found the lease had been taken away. He immediately applied to the insolvent, who went to an attormey's office and obtained a lease o No. 7, Southampton-buiidings, which he gave to Mr. Braton. That lease, however, was of much less value than the other, and the house had been taken by the ground landlord in consequence of the subletting being a breach of the covenants of the lease. Mr. Bruton had received between 201. and 301. from the tenants of the house after much trouble, and now complained of having been defrauded out of his money. The iusolvent admitted that ho had a lease of No. 17, Southampton-buildings, but asserted that it had never been exhibited to Mr. Bruton, who had only seen the lease of No. 7, which was intended to be deposited. Mr. Commissioner PSILLIPS adjourned the case for the preduction of both the leases, and refused to enlarge the ail in the interim, remarking that unless the insolvent could alter the facts he had a serious case of fraud to answer. (Before the CHrzF Co3SSIssSoN.) IN RL J. Ri CROWTHER. This insolvent, a coal-dealer, was heard in September last, and his case had been adjourned f or amended accounts. He now came up for judgment, and was ordered to be dischared after the lapse of nine calendar months from the vesting order for making awvay with property.

?POLIOR. MA~SrOy-HOusE.A lad named Frederick Simma was brought before the I,OBD MLYOR aDd Mr. Alderman HAzE cbarged, as stated on the sheet, with having "maliciously publahed a defamatory libel of and conCerning the Bank of London~ in Breadneedle-Sreet, and the dLrectors there. Mr. Paine, solicitor to the Bank of tondoni, who appeared for the prosecution, said that the prisoner was given into custody tor parading in front of the bank with the placard produced by the of ficer, on which was printed,-" Bank of London.-ltetirement of 140 shareholders. For lists of nameS see.Toud-.5'toc Companfe .7eourna. Sold here." Itwasnothis intention to prosecute the charge against theprisoner,whohad furnished him with the name and address of the person who had employed him to carry the placard and to sell tht nub. lication therein referred to. Mr. Paine then applied for a summons against that person, which the magistrates immediately granted. As the application was of an ex parte nature, we orait the atatements made by Mr. Paine upon which it was founded. The boy was then set at liberty. GUILDALL.-Rebecca Rice Hamilton, the woman who stands charged with writing and sending letters containing tbreats of the most diabolical character to numeroup mercbsnts, bankers, and others connected with the city, with the view to extort money from them, was again brought up before Alderman HtrSwPtBy for further examination. The depositions taken on the last examination in the case of Messrs. Welch and Margetson were then read over. James Hide said,-I am in the service of Mr. Allingham surgeon, of Moorgate-street. On the 17th of February last, between 9 and 10 o'clock at night, I found the letter produced in our letter-box, and I gave it to my mother. Elizabeth Hide said,-I am in the service of Mr. Allingham in the capacity of housekeeper. I received the lotter from the last witness, and I gave it to Mr. Allingham the same evening. Mr. W. Alligham said-On the 17th of February last, I received the letter produced from my housekeeper. The letter commenced with a request that I rwould send a sovereign by post to either of three addresses named, and threatened that unless I complied the writer would accuse me of the most awfal offences it Is possible to conceive. The letter concluded with a caution not to lay any traps to cateh her, as no money would be received unless sent by post, and that if I reglected to send I might expect all kinds of an. noyance, as what she began she always went through with. On the day 'after I received this letter I consulted a legal friend, and then took it to the chief office in the Old Jewry, where I placed it in the hands of a police inspector, by whose directions I enclosed a farthing in an envelope and addressed it as directed, putting a small cross in one corner, that being the private mark requested by the writer. These precautions led to the apprehension of two persons at that time, but the evidence notbeing sufficient to sustain acharbe of conspiracy (one of the persons being of unsound mind) they were discharged. Jarvis, the detective officer said,-I have seen the pri. soner write upon two occasions, and to the best of my belief the whole of the letters produoed are in her handwriting. I have received two letters of the same descrip. tion, one of which was thrust under the door of the Bow. lane police station. One of the letters I received is dated on the same day as that p duced by Mr. Alling. bam, and contains the following remark, "I have sent a letter this morning to Allingham, threatening to expose him." Those letters are, I believe, in the prisoner's hand. writiing. Bull, the detective officer, said,-When I apprehended the prisoner I took her to the station and searched her. I found upon her a key which she said belonged to her room - and on proceeding to her lodgings I opened the door wAth the key, and in a box which was oPen I discovered two letters, the writing and oontents of which are similar to those already produced; but they were addressed to other persons. Prisoner.-Those were letters I had delivered to me. Bnul-I also produce two other letters, one of which the prisoner acknowledged to me she had written, and the other I. saw her write. Thain, the detective officer, said,-I was with Bull, and while searching her box I found the book of poems I produce, and upon exaamining it I find that one of the fly-leavee has been torn out; and upon comparing a letter I received from Mr. Brough, written upon the fly-leaf of a book, I discovered that torn edge of the latter corresponded ex. actly with the torn edge of the remnant of the leaf left in the book. The sie, quality, and colour of the paper, as well as the three gilt edges, also co nded with the book, and contained similar dsgusting anrrd ominable threatstothose in the other letters produced. Mr. Francis Babb, said,-The prisoner has beon in my employ, and I have frequently seen her write. I beleve the letters produced are in her handwriting. Alderman HuAE1 Bry (to Mfr. Allingham).-Do you know anythimg of the prisoner I MIr. Alingham.-I never saw her in m life. Prisoner.-I know nothing of Mr. Allingham. I never wrote to him in my hfe. Alderman HEVMwssY.-Eow has she obtained her BD .-I have made inquiries, Sir, and find that she used to get high wages as a niantlemaker. Alderman Hurpszimy.-Have you reason to believe that she has obtained any money by means of these letters? Bull.-I have not been able to find any one who has sent money in consequeonce of these threats ; but I have &scer. tained that these filthy letters have been sent round to every person holding a respectable position in the city; and every one who has employed her during the last five years has been subjected to the antoyance of receiving these abomin. atbhle; letters continually, from tho time sAte first entered Alderman H PHPIERs-.-You have heard the evidence, what hare you to ray in answer to the charge? Prisoner.-The officer seems to forget that I have been the first to give information of this matter. I never wrote an anonymous letter to any one in all my life. The prisoner was then remanded for the completion of the depoisitionls,preptaratery to committing her for trial at the MARLnBOROUGH.STRET.-Wiliam Baylis, Mary Devine, and Jane Harris, otherwise Catherine Dalton. otherwise llenHaioncekssotherwise Amelia Tunney, were charged with Slr.Lewis,ly.place, was for Baylis and Devine; Mr. Police-constable Joy saId he was in plain clothes on duty in Regent-street some time ago, and saw the prisoners, who were dressed in superior style, together. Enowing thema to be pickpockets, he watched them, and saw Harris go up to several ladies who were looking into the shops and put her band on their pockets, the other prisoners, Baylis especially, who had a coat on his arm, covering her proceedings. Having procured assistance, he proceeded to take them into custody, but the prisoner Baylis attempted to make his escape, and ran half a mile before he was knocked down by an omnibus man. On searching the prisoner Baylis two purses were found, one containing 8. in gold and some silver, the other a quantity of receipts and stamps. When the prisoner was knocked down he was seen to throw away either a portemonnaie, or a pocket-book. Police-Sergeant Loome (B division) and Police-Sergeant Broad (L division) gave evidenoe agamst the prisoners. Mr. Lewis having addressed the Court on behalf of Baylis and Devine, Police-Sergeants Broad and Loome proceeded to ive the following extraordinary history of the career of lxrris, a well-looking girl about 17 years of age :-In 1852 she was taken up for picking pockets, and then gave ber age 10 years. The Bow-street magistrate, Mr. HaL, taking into account her tender years, directed that she should be given into the care of her mother. On the followb-g Monday the mother herself was in custoy for felony. Infleceiber, 1852, Haurs was again in custody for picking pockets. In May, 1853, she was again in custody for picking pockets at the Victoria Theatre; in December, 1853, again in cusody for picking pockets; sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. Sent to the Chelsea Reformatory; discharged reformed. In custody again a fortnight afterwards, and sent to Hllo. way Prison for three months ; lost sight of for some timehut again In custody in August, 1855, charged with picking' pockets, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Afterwards in custody for an assult, and sentenced to two months' imprisonment. Mr. Solomons said he feared he should fail in convincing the Bench that Harris -was arespectable young woman, or that she had not been convicted before. He should therefor leave the case in the handsg of the Court. Mr. BxxnDo-x had no doubt whatever that the prisoners were together In Regent-street for the purpose of picking pockets. The case Of Harris was a melancholy one; her career from childhood had been one of crime, and there was little doubt she owed her present condition to the bad ex. ample and teaching of her parents. Baylis and Devine were sentenced to one month's imnrisonment, and Harris to three months'. WoRsrs.RzSMx.-Benjamin Eill, a young fellow well known to the police, was charged with being concerned with other men who have escaped apprehension in the following garotte robbery. William Cavalier, a dairyman in Oxford-street, Mile. end, stated,-I was returnin g'home between 2 and 35on the morning of the 7th inst., when, on reaching the corner of omas-street, Whitechapel, two men and a woman came up and looked me in the face. One man then put his arm round my throat, and while he held me in that way the prisoner took my goldowatch, worth 12l., out of my waist- coat-pocket, and, deliberately twisting it off my goli guard. chain, put it into his own trousers-pocket. The other man tbon let go of my neck, and they both walked away, but I was sC much hurt in the front of my throat from th;o pres- sure that I immediately fell forward on my face in a state oi insensibility. How long I remained so I do not know, but on coming to myself I called " Police," and met an officer, who took me to the station, where shortly after another officer brought in my hat, which I had lost, and the woman who was withthe men. Mary Hurley, the womau referred to, said,-I am an unfortunate, and was charged at this court the day after the robbery with being concerned in it, but was discharged by the magstrate.

SOUTuWXRL-Patrick Barry, a stout powerful-looking fellow who has been in custody for eight. week: was brougit before IfMr. ComBzn- for: final examination, chbarged. with committing a most murderous assault u,con-Willfa i Rendall, police.constable No. 138;, by ldcking kim and thereby rendering him nnfitfor anfurEter duty. The com] ainaut, who was ssted into the cour and with the aiW of crutchec WM enabled to keep himself from falling, on being seated alongside Mr. Evans, the surgeon, stated rn a weak voice that on Saturday might, the 28th of Febr0h ry lastY about half-pat 9.o'clock he was on dty in Tooley-street, when he saw a disturbance, He immediately went to the assistance of 148 and 186M, who were struggling on the ground with the prisonier. The latter was in their custody and refused to walk to the station-house, so that they were compelUed to carry him. In goin JoN one Of the constables had his hat knockedof' bee th priBoner's leg to ik it up. The prisoner then pushed wit3ness down with his leg, and while he wasdowntn he kicked him on the back three or four times. He felt great pain at the time, and was not able to move, but he was lifted up and conveyed to a surgeon's, who had since attended him, and he was at the present time in great agony and unable to stand up. William Churchill, 148 X said that on the night of the 28th of Februazyhe was on duty in Tooley-street, when he saw the prisoner creating a disturbanoe,. and he requesed him to go away. The prisoner abused him and ran down Vine-yard, where he .picked up a brick and threw it at witness&s head, knockmng off his hat. He then went and took him into cusody, when he was very Tiolent-and threw him down. The last witness and other constables came to his assistance, and they got the risoner as far as CoUepastreet, when he saw him kick the former down, and kick him several times on the back while he was on the ground. William Bodle, 186 M, said he was on duty in Tooley. street on the night in quesion, when his attention was called to the prisoner, who was struggling with the last vwitness on the ground. He told the prisoner that he must goto the sttionnoase, when he Iicked him several times and Labled him. Btendall came to their assistance, and while they were carring the prisonerto the stationhousehe kicked him down, an kicked h on the back several times while lying with his face on the ground. Witness was everal days after that unable to leavel hs bed and somne time before he could do his duty. Mr. Thomas Evans, surgeon to the M division, residing at 159, High-street, Southwark, said that on the night of Saturday, the 28th of February last, Police-constable 138 M was brought to his surgery and oomplained of an injury to his back. He examined him but could find no external In. Jury or marks of violence. He had attended himever ce up to the present time, and he had ascertained that hisspine was so injured that it was likely he would never be able to return to his duty or do any hard work. The Magistrate was informed that the prisoner had been several times In custody and committed to prison for assaulting the polioe. There were two or three in the h division who were now suffering from his brutality, for which offences he had been punished. The prisoner, In a bullying tone, said what the constables had stated was all false, and that it was a shame that he should have been kept in custody eight weeks for nothing. Mr. CoMBE told him that according to the testinony of the officers (whose evidence he had no reason to doubt) it was clear that he had committed such a brntal assault on one of them that he was not likel] to recover from the effects of his violence. His past conduct had also bedn so bad that he should send him to the sessions for trial, where, on being convicted, he would be punished with some severity. The prisoner said it was the constables' own fault. They knocked and kicked idm aboit shamefully. Hr. COMEi1 told him that would be for a juryto consider. He must be committed for triaL. The injured constable was then isted out of court, and conveyed in s cab, with the surgeon, to his lodgings. LAavsrH.-Charles Billars, a smartly-dressed young fellow, who was taken in and brought home from Paris, was placed at the bar before Mr. E1LioTT on a charge of sealing about 701. in gold and silver, the property of Mr. Henry Cook, his master. . Cock deposed thatho was seheesemonger and carried on business at No. 32, Beckford-row, Walworth.rad, but slept at his house in the Rent-road. Onthe night of Satur. day week, on closing his shop, he gave his cash-box, s was his custom, to his niece, Sarah Goodwin, to take care of, and on the following might was informed that the box bad been broken open and its contents carried away by the prisoner, who had been in his service for about two year Hi had also found that In addition to the contents of the cashbox the prisoner had carried away a writing-desek from the parlour, in which there were deposited some deeds amd other papero. He gave information to the police, and from information that had reached him he on Thursday last started for Pais, accormpaned by Sergeant Coppin, and there on Saturday suceded in apprehending the prisoner, who at once expressed his wil. ngness to give up all the money he had left. He then took witness and Coppin to his hotel, and there delivere up 53. in cash, the writing-desk, with the deeds, and aomedner clothes of a Parisian cut which he had purchased. Sergeant Coppin took charge of the property, aud the prisoner and they at once started for London. Ann Elizabeth Heatheringtor_ a servant in the employ. ment of the last witness, said that on the evening of Sunday week the prisoner left home about 6 o'clock, but returned and proceeded to his bedroom, and at this time witness was in the bedroom of Miss Goodwin, her master's niece. The prisoner requested her to go to the kitchen for a few minutes, saying he vished to go to the apartment sho was in. She (witness) did as she was requested, and in a few moments the prisoner came downstairs and told her she might return to the room. She left. In going up. stairs she heard the jingling of money, she thought, in the kitchen, and soon after the prisoner left the house. On returning to the kitchen 'witness found some papers strewn about the floor, and In some sawdust she observed her master's cashbox broken open and empty, and aso missed the writing-desk produced from the parleur. In reply to a question from the Lagistrate, The witness said that Miss Goodwin, her master's niee, went out on the Sunday evening in question, and was absent from home when the prisoner returned and went to her bedroom, as before statedL Sergeant Coppin corroborated the statement of the prose. cutor, and produced the whole of the property foundin the prisoner's possession. He also stated that he had ascertained that on Saturday night week Miss Goodwin, instead of placing the cashbox n a cupboard as usual, put It up the chimney a httle way, as a place2 of supposed safety, and the prisoner becoming acquainted with this fact, acknowledged that the temptation was too great for him. and he could not: reist it. ln concluson the officer said that on mnlocdng the wrriting desk produced he found a pistol loaded with bhll and a cap on the nipple. The prisoner, who said he should reserve his defence, was fully commlitted for trial. GRM wC}L-Our reporter was requested to achknow. ledge the receipt by M1r. TsLL= of the second half of a 51.

THE FRENCH CENsus.-An musing eircumistance which occurred the other day at a concert given in the Salle-Cecile for the benefit of the orphan institution of Iny, coupled vith the crowds of joyous children which throng the Tuileries gardens and the Palais Royal, Would shake my belief in the asserted decline of tho populatiorn were that fact not based on official figures. t the above concert Mesdames Viardot and Caroline Duprez were the principal vocalists, and Madame Phose Cheri performed with M. DUPUiB in a slight "proverbe." The proceodinms went off most successfully, and a lady patroness, approach. ing Madame Rose Ch6ri, begged her to atep round the concert-room and make a collection in favour of the institu. tion. Madame Rose Cheri, with much embarrassment, replied that her position was of so very interesting a nature that she dared not venture into a crowd. The ladypatroness smiled, and invited Madame Caroline Duprez, or rather Madame Vanden Hemel-for such is the harmonious name of her husband-to make the collection. But Madame Duvrez blushed, and confessed that her position was so very similar to that of Madame Rose Ch6rl, that she mnst beg to decline. "Then the lot mustfaU to you, Mfadame Viardot " excclaimed the lady patroness. Madame Viardot sighed and responded, "Alas! I am like those ladies." The lady patroness i despair handed the plate to M.

The Limerick Obserer gives currency to a piece of Four Courts gossip to the effect that the Irish Attorney-Goneral wil in a few days be promoted to a Chief Justiceship, which, it is alleged, is abon. being vacated by the present possessor. The resulv of this shadowy rumour has been that a canvass of I the constituency of Ennis has been aetuallyr set on foot, and it is added that Mr. Joha Ball, the ex- member for Carlow county, is a candidate for the. representation. PFlly admitting Mr. Ball's qlifications, the Observer, nevertheless, deprecates the in trcduction of a stranger, unless it can be showa that there is no gentlewan of recognized politicla position to be found in the county of Clare worthy to be entrusted with the Parliamentary guardianship of the county town. It wiU be time enough, however, to discuss this part of. the question when a the vacancy shall have been created. As yet there is no sign. A local paper (the Clare Freeman), just come to hand, also notices the rumour of an imme- I diate vacancy in the representation of Ennis, and states that Captain W. Steopoole is alteady in the field as a candidate.. hMORE rPOVISIOX RIOTS. The Galwaay Vindicator atates that the pra'cice of exporting potatoes had led to serious demonstrations there, as well as in other parts of the kingdom. The price, it seemas, of this general article of the diet of the poor has doubled, and the rates are now 5id. per atone-a high figure in a remote country town. On Saturday morning 200 Claddagh men marched towards the docks and actually broke into the store of a dealer, but they retired without doing material damage. They sulbsequently attacked other stores, but were dispersed by the pollee. The exportation of the food of the people, as the Galway paper observes, is unqutestionably an evil at particular seasons, but it is one for which it would be difficult to provide a remedy. Another account savs that the mnob made a personal attack on a Mr. Tierney, who is merely a contraetor for supplying the woriLhouse. His store was broken open, his potatoes were scattered about, and he himself was very roughly handled. mTlis CHURCH nueCAro socIETY. In reference to a recent article in The Times commenting upon the annual report of the abovenamed society, the Nortlwr,i Whig has the following remarks:- " Frorm the first the great object of the society has been to show on its rolls a large number of RRoman Catholic pupils, and during the last year it claimsto have had 16,000 children of that faith in attendance at its schools. Now, considering that the seolar oducation givea in the schools under the national system is far superior to that afforded in those under the Church Education Society's academiee, we are led to inquire what is the attraction in the latter which induces Roman Catholics to prefer them to the former? Why, the religious instruction they re. ceive, answer tho advocates of the society. And in what does that religious instruction consist ? In learning the Church Catechism, and reading the authorized version of the Bible-in other words, in instraction in the doctrine5 of the established church, Then, will the society be good enough to explain to us why it is that these chiSdren are Roman Catholics, who ought to be suah edifying and enthusiastio disciples of the tenets of Protestantism? Do they profess true Evangelical faith during the six secular days of the week, and idolatry and superstition on the holy seventh ? Or is it that, not being quite certain as to whether Protestantibm or Romen Catholicism is the right religion, they want to cheat the devil, and make sure cf Eeaven, by adhering to both creeds at the same time ? If they are real Protestants, then the society Is guilty of a deception. If, however, tbey attend the schools, and still remain Roman Catholics, surely that is an awkward fact for a body whose cardinal doctrine is, that the 'free and unfettered use of tha Scriptures' inevitably converts the Roman Catholic to Protestantism. We invite the friends of the society to consider whether they do not prove too much when they make a arade of mythical thousands of Roman Catholic scholars. w e do not believe in the eociety's figures. We do not believe that in aU Ireland it has the whole year roand, 5,000 lond fidc Roman Catholic scholars, We kuow that in several districts Roman Catholic paretnts send their children to its schools, because the landlord of those parents coerce them so to do. We could point to at least one large property in the county of Armagb, every. Roman Catholic tenant on which had to make bis children go to'the Church school, under penalty of being refused turf-banks and other privileges; and it is only a short time since we saw in one of our contemporaries that a certain landholi!er in the county of Monaghan was endeavouring to compei his tenantry to have their children educateed at the Church Education Society's school. By these anS similar improper means it is that the society is enabled to beast of the attendance of Roman Catholics. These remark3 se should have thought it unnecessary to make on an exploded confederation, but that it may be useful to put Phe Times right on what our contemporary naturally regards as the only point in the report, and which is no point at all."
THE BANKRUPTRY OF SIR CHARLES Fox AN MtIR. EmwNFXrSON.-Yesterday Sir C. Fox and Mr. Eenderson appesred upon their last examination before Mr. CommiisionerBalguy in the Birmingham )istrictConrt of Bankru toy. An abstract of the balance-sheet filed was pubBled in The Timea on Saturday, the 18th inst. M5r. Bsal-, of the firm of Messrs. Colmore and Beale, who appeared as solicitor to the assignees, applied that the bankrupts should pass. He stated that their affairs had been under the investigation of the assignees ever since October last, and they vere perfectly satisfactory. A further adjournment conld do no possible good, while it might occasion considerable delay and inconvenience to all parties. The Commissioner said he thought that in a matter of so much importance, and where it was understood there were disputed claims upon the estate, they should not be in a hurry, but that the examination should be further adjourned, to afford creditors time. for further examination. A conversation between the solidtors and Commissioner ensued, when ultimately the bankrup's passed, and the certificate meeting wias fixed for the 27th of July. In the meantime (three montlis) the creditors and aU other parties will have the opportunity of malkinu all neocssary inquiries into the affairs of the bankruptcy and be pre- pared to lay the result bfoto 'the Uorhmisgioner on that I occasion.

ATTTED MURDEB. AND SUICIDE.-Yesterday morning a murder was attempted and a suicide committed in Sheep-street, Bristol. In one of the small houses of thxt street lived an Irish labourer named Jobn Cooney, aboat C6 years of age, his wife, a son, and daughter. Tho hnshand and wife have it seems been living on very bad terms for some time past, so much so that for the last few weeks they have not lept together; and it would appear that on the morning in question Cooney had determined to wreak his vengeance on his wife for somne reel or fancied grievanco. Abontbhalf-p2st 90'clock, while his daughter was absent hlor the house and his son was upostairs, Cooney suddenly eized a heavy hammer, and wzith it savagely struck his wife just over her eyes. He then draaged her into a vvaterclosot, sad there conttnued to beat her with the hammer on hhe head and aide, fearfully contusing her face and fracturing several of her riba. At last the poor woman managed to escape from her infuriated assailant, and rushed bleeding prufusely to the upper part of the house. Her son waa caUed up by a lodger, and a vehicle being procured Ms. Cooney was at once conveyed to tho Royal Infirmary. In the meantitne, however, the husbandchad destroyed himself. On Cooney's son going in search of his father he found the wretched man lying at the bottom of the cellar steps stretched out on his face in the midst of a pool ot blood, which was still flowing from a gash in his throat-a gasa t hat had wellnigh severed the bead from the body. Medieal easistance ws sedfly procured, but was unawailing. TheI wound inflicted bythe suicide extended as far back as the spne, and it as evident that death must havc been inst%nu taneou. An inquest twas commenced on the body by Mr. J. B. Gnindon, the city coroner, in the course of the morn. ing. Ater zme formal et'idenee had been received theinc9,niry aeeadjourned till.

BUDDOA AND HIS ORrTCr.. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TliMS, Sir,-r. Facis Barlam, of Bath, as protesUd in. a letter, printed ia 2Vi 2imea of the 24tti of Aprii, p in my interpretotion of NirvAus, or the atvmum tonux of the Buddhitst He maintains that the Nirv&na in which the Buddhists believe, and which they represent as the highet goif thaeirielion and philoophy, neans union and communion with God, or abiorption of the individual soul by the divine essence, and not, s I tried'to show in mY art1cl5 on the Buddhis Pilgrims, itter annihi. lation. I mut xot take up much more of your space with so abstruse a subject as Buddhist mnetaphysics; but atthe tmce time Iomiot allow3[r. B&rhanmg protest to pes Ia. noticed The authorities which he briugs forward against vay aocount of Buddhism, and partiedULArly agicet my interPretation of NirvAna, seem formidable enough. There is Neander, the great church historian-Creuzer,tke famous. scholar-and Huec, the weLl-known traieller and mission. Wo--all isiterpreting, as Mr. Barham says, the NirsAna of the Buddhists in the sense of an apotheois of the human, oul, xuch as it was taught iu the Vedanta philosophy of the Brainins, the Sufism of the Persias, and the ChristianWysticism of Tanler, and not in the sense of absolute annihilation. Nowr, with regard toNeander and Creuzr, I beg to observe that their works were written before the canonical books of the Buddhists, composed in Sanwcrit, had been discovered, or at least before they had been sent to Europe. Besides, neither Neander nor Creuzer was an Oriental scholar, and their knowledge of the subject could only be secondhand. It was in 1828 that Mr. Brian Houghton Hodgson, then Resident at the Court of Nepal, gave the first intimation of the existenoe of a large reli. gious literature written in Sanscrit, and preserved by the Buddhists of Nepal as the canonical books of their faith. It was in 1829 that the same eminent scholar and naturalist presented the first setof these books to the Royal Asiatic Society in London. In 1837 he made a similar gift to the Sodet6 Asiatique of Paris, and some of the most imaportant works were transmitted by him to the Bodleian Library at Oford. It was in 1844 that the late Engine Burnouf published, after a careful study of these documents, his classical work, Introduction a Z'HsoirC duz Beddhkime IT7dien, snd it is from this book that our knowledge of Buaddhism may be said to date. Several works have since been published, which have added considerably to the stock of authentic information on the doctrine of the great Indian Reformer. There is Burnoufls translation of the Lotus de la Bonnc Loi, published after the death of that lamented scholar, together with numerous essays in 1852. Thero are two interesting works by the Bev. Spence Hardy-Ea,crne iifonachUi, London, 1850, and A jfanuaZ of Buddhijm Londonf, 1853; and there are the publications of HL Stanislas Julien, E. Foucaux, Professor H. L Wilson, and others, alluded to in our article on the Buddhtst Pilgrim. It Is from these works alone that we can derive correct and authentic information on Buddhism, and not from Neander's History of the Christian Church, or from Creuzer's Synzbolij. If auy one will consult these works he will find that the discussions on the true meaning of Nirvana are not of .modem date, and that, at a very early period, different philosophical schools among the Buddhists of India, and diSferent teachers who spread the doctrines of Buddhism abroad, propounded every conceivable opinion as to the orthodox explanation of this term; but it will also be seen that the earliest and highest authority on Buddhist metaphysics is a work called Prainj-pd-raniO4, and that in it the meaning of NirvAna is that of absolute annihilation. Every Sanscrit scholar knows that NirvAna means " blowing out," and not absorption. The human soul when it arriveg at its perfection. is blown out, if'we use the phraseology of the Buddhists, like a lamp; it is not absorbed, as the Brahmins say, like a drop in the cean. Neither in the system of Buddhist philosophy, nor in the SankqYphilosophy, fromwhich Buddha seems chiefly to have borrowed, was there any place left for a Divine Being by which thu human soul could be absorbed. The ineradicable feeling of dependence on something else, which is the life-spring of all religion, was completely numbed in these systems, and it wias only after several generations had passed away, and after Buddhism had become the creed of millions, that this feeling returned with increased warmth, changing, as I said in my axticle, the very nothing into a paradise, and deifying the very Buddha, who had denied the existence of a Deity. That this has been the case in China we know from the interesting works of the Abbe Huc, and from other sources, such as the Catechism of hc Shaamans, or the latw and Regulation, of ae ZPriesthood of BuddAa En China, translated by Ch. F. .r?cumann, London, 183L In India, also, Buddhism, as soon as it became a popular religion, had to speak a more human language than that of metaphysical Pyrrhonism. But, if it did so, it was because it was shamed into it. This we may see from the very names which the Brahinins apply to their opponents, the Banddhas. They-call them Kdsi7;as -those who maintain that there is nothing; Sanyaradi,is. those who maintain that there is a universal void. The earliest authority to which we can go back, if we want to know the original character of Buddhism, is the Buddhist Canon, as settled after the death of Buddha at the first CounciL It is called the Trip3taka, or the Three Baskets, the first containing the 8(ltras, or the discourses of Buddha; the second the Vinaya, or his code of morality; the third, the Abhidharma, or the system of metaphysics. The first was compiled by Ananda, the second by Upili, the third by K.isyapa-all of them the pupils and friends of Buddha. It may be that these collections, such as we now possess them, wero finally arranged, not at the first, bat at the third Council. Yet, even then, we have no earlier, no more authentic, documents from which we could form an opinion as to the original teaching of Buddha; and the NirvAna, as taught in the metaphysics of KAsyapa, is annihilation, not absorption. Buddhism, therefore, if tested by its own canonical books' cannot be freed from the charge of Nihilism, whatwer, changes it may have undergone in later times, and among races less inured to metaphysical discussions than the Rindoos. The only ground on which we may stand, if we wish to defend the founder of Buddhism against the charges of Nihilism and Atheism, is this, that, as the Buddhists themselves admit, the "t Basket of Metaphysics" was rather the work of his pupils, and not of Buddha himself. This is an argument which Mr Francis Barham might have used with more success, and by which he might have justified, if not the first disciples, at least the original founder of Buddhism. Nay, there is a saying of Buddha's, which tends to show that all metaphysicarl discussion was regarded by him as vain and useless. It is a saying, mentioned in one of the MSS. belonging to the Bodleian Library. As it has never been published before I may ba alloweed to quote it in the original-" Sadasad vichAram na sahate"-" The Ideas of being and not being do not admit of discussion"-s tenet which, if we oonsider that it was enunciated before the time of the Eleatic philosophers of Greece, and long before Hegel's Logic, might certainly have saved us many a tough and indigestible argument. So much in answer to Mr. F. Barham and his quotations from Neander. Crewse", and HAo. YOUR REVIWBR. I Oxford, April 24.
LARGE RIFLED GUNS TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your article, to-day, on improvements in rifles you ask a question which I hopo you will permit me to say a few words upon. You ask, "Are the3e improvements ap. plicable to artilery as well as small arms ?" It is of the utmost importanoe that this subject should be vell ventilated, for there really exists no reason why large rifles, ali4s rifled cannon, should not before this have been introduced into Her Majesty's service. The improved rifle possesses such a much longer range thin the old rifle simply because the projectile employed is elongated, and therefore can be made 50 per cent. heavier than the almost obsolete spherical balL It has been found that the same rifle wldl throw a 24-dram conical buUct, with tvo drams of powder, nearly trice as far as it will throw a 16-dratn round ball, with 4 dranms of powder. The heavier bullet, if it is made to rotAte on its axis by tho spiral grooves of the gun, meets with no grter resistanco from the atmosphere than the lighter shot of the same diameter, but its greater weight absorbs more rmouentum from the expansive force of the powder, and parts with its velo. city more slowly during flight, whil3 the gun is not strained more by the heavy ball, because the quantity of powder is reduoed proportionably. In 1845 I applied practically the principle of the improved rifle to cannon, and published in The imae the par. ticulars of some remarkable experiments made by rme at Shoeburyness, with a 9-pounder field gun rifled. My projectiles, weighing 14 and 151b., had nearly three-quarters of a mile longer range than the round servioe shot, although I uwed only half the usual charge of powder; and with a 32-pounder gun, of ordinary stength, my shells, weighing 601b., had the same proportional superiority with 5ilb of powder, over the service 321b. round ball, with l0lb. of powder. The gun being rifled not only enabled me thus to convert the 3-2-pounder service gun into a 50-pounder, but it also enabled me to fire shells of this weight instead of solid ehot, and shells which inight be axrrLnged to bnrst infallibly at the insuant of striking, like Colonel4acobs' small-arm projectile; added to Wbioli whs the extia6rdinary pie sion, unzattafable with smooth-bore gun,s, If-ny of -yourzeaders winisit the Musum of the United S 4*, IRelitutto, WhitO l4 ty sn see somo of the aitua )AiT*heh b heL - - -.

We remain, Sir, your obedient servants. A. GIBBS AND SONS. I L(nlon, April 27. "Legation of Peru, London, April 27. Gentletnen,-A law, dated 11th of March h.st has been psaaed by tbo National Convention, and aade public by the Executive, with regard to the Internal and External Debt of Peru, according to which an increase of 2 per ont. hus been assigned to the dnking fund of the AngloPeru. vian Four-and-a-Half per CenL Debt, to tLke effect from the next year, when the annual redemptions will amount to 7 per cent.; and in the same law it is enacted that when the state of the national Tresury shallallow it, after pro. viding for the ordinary and extraordinary expenditure oj the nation, the Congres wMil aet apart the surplus of the fiscal revenues for extraordinary redemptions of the AngloPeravian debt. " It has also been enacted that on the Converted Debt transferred to England the 4.1 per cent. per annum interest stipulated in the bonds shaU be paid, the first half-yearly dividend on the 30th of June, and the secomn on the 31st December of this year; and the dividends. which have acrued from the 1st of Jannary, 1855, to the Ist of January, 1857, shall be paid in two moieties, the first on the 30th of JTune, and the second on the 31st of December, 185, for the amount of which certSacates will be given payable to bearer, if so required by the holders ot the atock. " With regard to the redemptions on this stock of 4per cent. per annum corresponding to 1855, 1856, and 1857, it is furher enaoted that they shall be made in 1858, 1859, and 1&60 in threo equal instalments, at the same time that purchases for the current redemptions of those years ahall be effected. " You will please to cause this information to be inserted in the principtl papers of this capital, and in communicating it to you I think it right to state, for the infonnation of the bondholders, that the nation has been influenced in recogniziDag these transferred debts, not only by reason of public convenience, but also by its anxiety to prevent Peru from being ccused of repudiating bonds which it is assured no longer exist in the hands of the original holders, but in those of third parties, this last argument having derived additional veight from the fact of many of these holders being Pritish and French subjects, and other foreigners, whose rights the Government of Peru is especially anxious to respect. " I take advantige of this opportnuity to correct various unfounded Etatements which have lately appeered in the public papers of this capital, reflecting on the conduct of my Government and of its agents in this cotmtry with regard to the Anglo-Peruvian and Converted Debts " In the first place, it has been stated that the Uribarren and Hegan Bonds amount to 2,200,000L, the fact being that the collective amount of both debts is now only 1,505,100., as, in addition to the redemptions, 611,800. of these bonds which were found unissued on the acession to power of the Grand Marshal Castilla have been cancelled by the orders of his Government " It has been alleged that the increase in the rate assigned for the redemption of the Anglo-Peruvian debts has not been approved, while it is well known that not only has the increase been sanctioned by the National Assembly, but that four redemptions at the increased rate have been made on the Four-and-a-Ealf per Cent and tbree on the Deferred, thereby cancelling 351,3001. of the Four-and-a-Half per Cent. Bonds snd 148,300L, of the Three ner Cent, Bonds, as may be een by the notices in the public papers. '"Comments have been made on the sapposed desire of my Government to introduce Converd Debts upon the Stock- xchange, but I begto say that this is a quettion with which the Government has nothing whatever to do, and which rests entirely between the holders of the bonds and the committee of theStock-Exchange. The circumstance of the dividends of these debts being payable, and the re. demptions made in this conutry, is the natural conseqnence of so large a proportion of the proceeds of huano consigned both to England and the continent being realized in Europe for account of the Government, " Observations have also been made on ' the mysterious and secret manner' in which the sinking fund set apart for the redemption of, the Four-and-a-Half per Cent. and Three per Cent Anglo-Peravian Bonds has been applied and invested, but the manner in which you haye conductd these operations, effecting your purchases through various regalar brokers of the Stock-Exchange, in the open niarket, is the, best answer to this aSSertion. BeLides, the total amount invested and the numbers of tho bonds bought and cancelled are alwrays duly advertised in the public papers, and thus afford to every bondholder the means of ascertaining notonly that the sial-ing fund has been duly appropriated, but also by calculation the average price at wshich they wvere purchased. "Insinnations have also been made that a lager amount should have been applied by my Government to these re- demptions, the fact being that the amount of the sinking i fund originaly stipulated has been considerably inceaseod, and thattthis increase has been entirely voluntry onthe part of my Government. In 1855 it was unconditionally augmented by the Government of General Castilla on the Four-and-a.Half per Cent, Stock, from 2 to 5 per cent., and on the Three per Cent. Stock from l to 3 per cent., and in the law of the 11th of March already referred to it is not only further increased to 7 per cent. on the Four-and-aHaifper Cent, but it is also enacted that if the finances of the country will allow it extzaordinary redemptions wiiU be subsequently ordered, " It sees needless to answer the complaint against my Government, that Peruvian Bonds are offered in this market at a lower price than they naturally ought to produce. "My Government unaerstands too 'well the sound principles of publio credit not sincerely to desire that its paper should command the high price which the pecnliar an unpreoedented guarantee whirch it offers ought to give it. I" It is notorious that since 1849, notwithstanding the difficulties which have presented themselves from vaious political causes, Peru has rigorously complied with all its oonmproinises with its Anglo-Pelrvian creditors, paying their dividends and maldng the redempions i the most punctuai manner. The policy and anxious desire of my Gover;ment are to free the country as soon as it ca posdbly do So from. every external debt, and with theassistaceof that -valuable comrnodity, a large proportion of the proau.eotwhich is speoially hypothecated to the English bondholders for the due performance oE its engaements- and which ctanot be diverted from this purpoee, whatever yay be the course of its internal poltic there i not the at reson to apprebend but that this object ill be sucoessfully accomplished. "Asmanyinnocent holdersof the bondgmay harebeen alarmed by the infounded assertions to which I have referred, Ihavo thought it well for their satisfacion to make these observations. Under ordinay crcumstanceS I thonl& ' abstain from taking any notice of remarks -2hieli =mut spring only from misapprehension or ignorance of the facts; but, as they evidently ie1to the pueuadiceof the English bondholdem-s, I must request you to givro-peblicity to thia communication.
