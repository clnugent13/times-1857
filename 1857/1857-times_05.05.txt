AUSTRALTA. [A po.tion of the following appeared In our second edikon of yesterday:-] By the arrival of the European we have receivea files of papers from Melbourne to the'l4th of March, and from Sydney to the 10th of March. We take the following from the Melbourne Age of the 14th March:- "THE NEW MINISTRY. " On Tuesday last the Assembly met, after the adjourn. anent consequent on the Ministerial defeat, to hear the explanatory statement of the new Premier. Mr. O'Shanessy, in a speech of considerable length; entered into a detail of the various stepshe had taken towards the formation of a Cabinet. ge had first applied, le said, to the leading men amongthe 29 bus who had voted in the majority against the previols =Zlinist. He hadoffered theCommissionersbip of Trade and Customs eaucesgively to Mesrmfoore and M'Culloch,who are eminent- members of the mercantile community; but both gentlemen bad been compelled to decline tha offer, not being able tb withdraw from their extensive pAvate concerns. He isad offered the two law appointments to Mur. Michie and Dr 3vans (a now arrival) respectively; but those gentlemen had S"so declined office for non-political reasons. Ultimately he had been able to secure the services of the following gentlomen:- "31cr . S. Chapman, Attorney.GeneraL Mr. J. V. F. Foster, Colonial Troasurer. "Mr. C. G. Daffy, Comuissioner of Public Works. "r.- A. F. A. Greeves, Commissioner of Trde and Customs. I "lfMr. G. S. W. Horne, Commissioner of Crown lhndi and Survey. "Mr. J. D. Wood, Solicitor-General. "Thosegentlemen, with Mr. O'Shanessyhimself Ma Chie Secretary, form the new Adminitration. '"M . Chapmran wa formerly Chief Justioe of New Zaland, and more recently Colonial Socretary of Taim -- Xr. Foster was formerly Colonial Secretay of this colony' i&nd at one time, indeed, acting Governor. Mr. Daffy is too well known to our English readers to require description. Dr. Greeves was one of the leaders in ahe old Iegislature, in which he sat as member for the city. Mr. Horne is a legal gentleman of high oharacter and respectability, brother to tho present Chief Justioeof Tasmania. Mr.Wooa is oneof our ablestlawyers, and was offered the Solicitor-Generalship a fortnight before ky Mr. Haines, and refused. It will thus be seen that with respect to social position, as well as ability, the new Ministry is a vast improvement upon the old." COMMERCIA1 INTELLIGENCE. "Since our last summary the markets have been glutaed by excessive arrivals from England, and the prices have been inordinately depressed Several failurea havo taken place, but they are mostly among small firns of limited means, and happlly not likely greatly to influence the markets. Yet confidenoe has been shaken, and few but cash transactions are ventured upon. As the banks have shown a disposition to accommodate firms of respectability, no permanent interruption to the course of legitimate trade is ikely to arise, and a crisis need not be apprehended. "Already we are feeling the benefits of regula seam communication with the old country, simultaneously with the last tracs of injury arising from excessive and ill-timed shipments. The rapid and regular communication with the home country will, doubtless, work wonders in reforming the system which has hitherto provailed among British coin mercial houses, but it is a pity that at the moment of the establiahment of a steam posta service our markets should onoe more have been swamped with goods in such immense quantities that it is almost utterly impossible for our population to consume them. At no period since the memorable crisis of 1854 have our merchants felt such difficulty In effecting an outlet for their goods. The trade ha, passed out of the hands of those who formerly held it, a new competing class has arisen, and those who were once the best customers of the original importers re now found keenly contesting the market vith them on almost equal grounds. Extensive retail dealers now find it worth while to commission buyers visiting England to parchase for cash in the home markets such articles in their line as Australian buyers know will suit the colonial market. Melbourne traders willingly pay an advance of 2i per oent. on the ordinary commission for the execution of their orders by peons so well up to what wi suit the locl trade. The more rapid steamer intercommunication between Victoria and England is likely to ltd to quite a commercial revolution in purchasing from wholesale houses. The moneyed shopkeeper no longer depends for recruiting or supplying his stock upon English houses, nor on the selections and prices of colonial importers, when he can avail himself of the services of one of his own class, who finds it worth while to become a special or general buyer for a good percetage, No doubt these steamers will be extensively used in this way in future, and our merchants should bestir themslves, lest they be extensively cut out of the market. " Our imports continue to present a large excess upon oun oxporta. The returns for the past week have not yet been made up; but, as the year is not yet very old, we prefer giving the amounts for the current year to those merely of the last four weeks:- Imports. Exports. Week ending 10th January ; £175,135 £313,635 W eek ending 17th January ... 328,724 364,840 Week ending 24th January .., 284,363 117,424 Week ending 31st .lanuary ... 594,787 391,458 Week ending 7th February ... 262,135 291,940 Week ending 14th February ... 258,947 262,860 Week ending 21st Februry... 247,122 1.30,921 Week ending 28th February 156,004 239,026 Week ending 7th March ,, . 314,996 336,242 £2,622,213 £2,448,246 " Thus displaying an excess of imports over exports o' 173,9671 " We aro beginning to look out for winter. Fortunately, howover, our roads to the interior are in much better order than they were at the same time last year. The lines o! road between the metropolis, Castlemaine, end Sandhurst are now completed, and that to Ballarat is in much better con dition than formerly. In some respects winter is the season most favourable for traffic, as then the provender for cattle is most abundant. Henceforth rates of cartage are less likely to be liable to serious fluctuation, the prices of goods in the interior to be kept lower, and the supplymore regular and even. Altogether, we hope that in a month or two a steady and remunerative trade with the interior will set in. " One of the chief points at present is the exceedingly depressed state of the flour market, but, as prices are now thought to have reached their minimum, and as there is a disposition to store goods, in anticipation of a better demand, the market is likely to take a start in the right direction. Already there seems some improvement, as we have heard of somo offers of 14. 10s. for the three fine Adelaide brands, which were refused. Horse food is very scarce, and seems to be the only class of article in which the market displays anything like activity. Colonial oats are in great demand at 9s. for good samples; maize, 9s. ; bran, 2s. to 2s. Id. For the latter sales have been effected at Is. ld., but only in order to save storage. " The Melbourne Exchange Compeny have just held their third half-yearly meeting. There are now 68 shareholders, representing a subscribed capital of 11,9001. Under these flattering circumstances, the Directors feel ufstified in proceeding with the works. The portion of the structure at present in hand includes a large board-room, secretary's bffice, library, reading-room, c., and is expcted to be finishedc before the 1st of June next. " The electric telegraph is now in full operation between Melbourne and the principal towns in the goldfields. The Governments of South Australa and New South Wales are making arrangements for connecting lines, and that of Tasmania is expected to be completed between 'Hobart Town and Launceston by the 1st of April next. The short lines connecting these towns with tohe extremities of the island are temporarily deferred; and, in consequence of the indisposition of the Tasmanian public to incur the expense of the cable across Bass's Strait (though the Victorian Govemnment have enigaged to share the expense), its constraction is indefinitely postponed. " The project of improving the navigation of the Yarra Yarra and the formation of docks In Batman's Swamp is for the present allowed to sleep. On the resumption of Parliamentary business, on the 15th of April next, we trnst that a matter of so much importance to the commercial wellbeing of Victoria may meet with the attention it deserves. "GoLD. "The depression in commercial matters generally is exerclsing an unfavonrable influence with respect to gold as well as other commodities, yet the yield of the various goldfields is tolerably steady and the returns do not present an unfavourable appearance. " The total amount of gold received by escort since our last summary (February 14) amounts to_ Week ending February 20 .. .48,032 0 27 - .35.213 15 , arch 6 . ... 67,805 5 ,, 13 . ... 2,709 0 169,760 0 Escort up to February 13 + ; 320o775 15 Total escort for 1857 ," ,Z , 490,585 15 Total gold shipped during 1857 . L.. 626,874 lfl MELBOURNE, JMT. 27. The official returns of exports and imports and of the state of the banks for the past year, compared in some aes with the returns of former years, enable me to present an accurate pictre of the very prosperous condition of the colony. The cuantity of gold exported throngh the Custom-house a 1 amounted to 3,008,281 ounces. The first Inventor TSroyT weight Old not contemplate tons of gold, but our computors have found it necesary to extend that meaure. Iand, reczoning2,0001b to the ton, we have exported 125 tons 6 cwt. 3 quarters 151b. and loz. In 1852 and 1853 the Customs returns aro not to be relied upon, as a great deal of gold was conveyed away by private hand. The returns for the last three years, how. ever, are more to be relied on, and they exhibit a steady increase. They are as followvs:- 185 1855. 1856, Recelvedbyea^ort 1,851,434 .. 2,191,911 .. ,5s7,c21 Exported .. . 144.197 .. 2.674 677 3. 5,003,28 Tho progressive increase is attributable to the extended Use of machinery. Paddling-mills are extensively used; surplus water is discharged from the deep sinldngs by means of steam engines, and quartz crushing by means of machinery with amalgamation in now extensively carried on at Bendigo and elsewhere, For the lait twvo years our exports have greatly exceeded our imports in valne. The oonsequence of this has been that the glut of goods which existed in the early part of 1855, in consequence of the heavy imports of 1853 ani 1854, has been worked off. Large liabilities have also been liquidated, and remnunerativeprioes have suffered cenmula. tion to go on to an extent very materially to lower the rate of interest and raise the prioe of securities. The value of our imports and exports for the last two years is exhibited by the following table:- 1855. 15 Both ears xpor*ts .. .. £12,706,819 .. .316 , £ 12,50 ., £f070.99 ImporS ,, .. 1,22279 .. 23,20.751 .. 463,030 Balance Ion favor} £2,o4u,r70 .. £1,12,499 .. £3,607,069 of the cion ' 360,6 During the firt three weeks of this year our exports amount to 1,138,1831,, and our imports to 839,5751., showing an exoems of purchaing power of 295,6031.

For notes in rculaion nd deposits the anks owe to the public 8,479,1051., while the public for notec and b'ilh discounted owe the be.ns 6,950,0751., makinga net balnce due from the banks to the public of 1,529,030L The price of securities and the decine in the rate of interest bear witness to the large amount of accumulated money capital waiting investment. Government Five pei Cent. Debentures are at par to J per cent. premiaum, and all other securities are high. Tho Government raiway scheme, which will no doubt be carried witb some modifications, Will throw about a milion and a hlf ol debentures on the market; but most of these will find their way to England, where the credit of the colony ought to bec aud I believe is, good. A far moro serious oonsideration connected with the making of about 165 miles of railway is the supply of labour. LAst year our population was only increaed by immigration to the extent of 20,566 souls. The year'before the increase was 40,000. The colony could easily abgorb 1,000 per week. The prosecution of the two lines of rail WAY will require 5,000 men ; part we can meet with here, but we must depend on immigration for part. The colony does not at all object to pay high wages, but a deficiency of labour is a serious impediment to progress. The Government has proposed to the Legisature to dispense wfith the servces of the Land and Emigration Com. missioners in Park-street, and havo a staff at home condsi ing of one commissioner and seven sub-agents. By such means the oDlony will most ikely obtain a cSS of people more uiited to our want& The oommissioners sent out hairesers, dacing-masteris, and every kind of labourer exoept navvies. I must here warn the commercial public against consigning large quantities of goods to this market without advice' I know that in 1852-3 if a shoe manufacturer got anorder he was vey apt to consign a silar parcel on his own accopt. The consequence was that the market soon became glutted. I hope tho encouraging state of our trade wil not stimulat men to repeat the process, or WOe shall have another glut in 1858. The Sydney Mint received 2s9,940oz. of gold in 1856, and coined to the value of 1,220,000. The revenue was 12,566. 4s. 7d. The New South Wales goldfields, though small com pared with ours, have yielded an increasedquantity of late; 138,823oz. were received dauring the year, of which 67,607cz were received during the last three months. NEW SOUTH WALES. (From the Sydnce Eimjnre of the 10th of Mfarch.) Since the departure of the Simla, on the 11th February, the community of New South Wales has not been agitatel by any unusual event, nor has any remarkable development of natural wealth or industri power occurred to stimulate to unwonted activity the stead course of our material pro. gress The colony hs pursued "the even tcnoui of its way," and even in the legisature nothing has stood out from the ordinary routine of business to disturb therepose cd society. The third of the European and Australian Royal Mail Company's steamships, the European, arrived In our harhour on tho 14th of Febrary, the third day after the deprture of the Simla. The outward puNgcsof the three ship3 sent out to oommence the line from the Australian side stand in the consecutive order of their dates as follows Oneida, Southampton to Sydney ... 72 days. Simula it ,, ,. 59 , European ,, ,, .. 61 , This uniform asucces has established for the new company a high prestige in tho colonies, which it is hoped will be increased by the runs between Australia and India. The first contract mail vid Suez, to leave Southampton on the 24th of February, with supplementary mail vid Marseilles on the 2d of March, will be brought to us by the return voyag of the Oneida, but cannot reach Sydney before the 21st or 22d of April. The Legislature is still in sesdon, but wil probably be prorogued during the next fortnight. On the 10th of February M.r Martin, in the Assembly, brought forward a motion containing a direct censure on the Ministers for offering situations in the public service to Mr. Gilbert EHott and Mr. John Rae, the prsent City Commissioners, whilo the official conduct of those gentlemen was under investigation by a committee of the House. The motion waa negatived by 21 votes to 17 The vacant seat in tho Legislative Assembly, caused by the acceptanco of the Presidency of the Upper House by Mr. Plunkett, has been filled up by the unanimous return of Mr. Deniehy, ayoung Australian of high ability and strong Liberal tendencles, who has avowed himseLf a decidod antiMinisterialist. On the 17th of February a public dinner, ou a large scale, was given to Mfr. Thomas S. Mort, on the eve of his depa ture for England. mr. Mort arrived in the colony nearly 20 years ago, and for a time was managing clerk to a Liverpool house which was then carrying on an extensive business. He subsequently started as an auctioneer, and in that capacity very successfully cultivated a connexion -with the pastoral interest, His business rapidly grew into one of vast magnitude, embracing various branches of industry and enterprise. A few years ago he embarked in the construction of a dry dock, on which work itis asaid, a capital of 100,000. has been sunk. The dock IS nowv completed, and, among other vessels, has received into it the three splendid pioneer steamers of the Australian Royal Mail Company. The fare weU dinner to Mr Mort was a public omplment well merited, and went off very successfully. On the 23d February two public meetings were held in Sydney for the promotion of objects sufficiently important to interest our English readers One was for the fermation of an Electoral Reform League, which was set on foot with great unanimity of sentiment by the vast crowd that attendee. Aa present the rep-sentative system by whiich tbe Legislative Assembly is elected gives great dissatisfaction to a large number of the inhabitants, throwving a preponderance of powver, as it does, in2tO the hands of the pastoral occupants and a limited number of persons who are connected w ith them in interest. The chief objects of the LRagne are to obtain a larger number of members for Sydney and the populous constituencies, and to limit the right of su2age in each elector to one electoral district. The other meeting on the 23d was to establish a society for the promotion of a Proteetionist poicy in the government of the colony. Among other measures still before the Legislature is tho Sydney Municipal Bil, which has been twice befor both Houses in consequence of extensive amendments mado by the Council after it had passed the Assembly. To-day a motion will be brought forward by Mr. Robertson, which, if carried, will probably lead to a chluge of Ministry. It is understood that the present Cabinet is much divided against itself, and would break up from internal diesagrement, even were they to close the session without further obstacles from the Opposition benches. Any motion carried against them now would afford the M isters an opportunity, which probably would not be thrown away, of saving themselves from the more ignoble fate of self-destruction. In this event, it is almost certain that either Mr. Cowper would be called back to the councils of the country, or Mr. Jones, a new member who has made a good position in the Assembly, would he intrusted with the power to construct a Government embodying the more decided democraqc of the House. Colonization is steadily advancing. Iand is fallUng more generally into the hands of working capitalists; new pursuits of industry are daily opening; our power of produc. tion ie gaining strength; and the elements of prosperity around us are constantly becoming more healthy and secure, We 'have collected below such information as is at present aocesible with reference to our exports of produce for the year 1856.

Withrnespect it cimate and productions. I have found them ra reatB to resemble those of theoLevant, near Smvrna, save tbat te snmmer is eotter, and thutnde are here subect to an occasonal vtst from that dreaded scourge, the sirocco. ho o. I asi nowwritiEng the sun is pourmng down .aflood od heat fully equal to that of a b:ot summer'sg day ino I ngland. Duringt the winter month3 the rain is ahnott mace.- sant, accompanied by thunder and lightning. The rivers at tbatseason, thoughfrequent1ydryinsume1 are nr~olbn t. torrents, aud cause serious inundations, when, as is sometimes tho case, this rain lasts upwards of two months Dar- ing the remainder of the earnotadrop of rainfals,butthe, nights are rendered cold by the very heavy dews that thoex prevail in most districts. Even at this season of the year my bournous has frequently been as thoroughly wetted by the dew as if it had been exposed to heavy rain. The nativesnever part with this covenug, winter or summer, wherew. the colonists, ignorant of the necessity for its use, are subject to frequent attacks of fever, diarrhoea, and ophthalmia. it must also be confessed that they in general indulge too. freely in the practicoe of dram drinking; even business. transactions are carried on and brought to a succeosful issne under the genial influenco of a succession of pctis werrc, It is impossible to visit a fiend hero without the production of the bottle, and, to speak the truth, I have met with more, drunkards here than in our old countries of Europe. This habit of drinking may probably be partly traced to the want;. of amusement and other excitement generally, as also nodoubt to the heat of the climate. - The colonists of Algeria are composed of a strangemedley of races from nearly every country in EuropeFrench, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Mlaltese Greeks, and a few Irish. Low coffeehonses and drinkingshopsabounmd inthe towns and villages, and of every speces of industry seem to exercise the most profitable calling.. Singular to. say, I have not as yet met with either English or Scotc oolonists. The Germans appear to be the most prosperous, as they are certainly the most industrious and temperato oP the colonists. Whenever I met with them and addresse& them in the language of their fatherland honest tears filleiL their blue eyes, and I was sure to meet with a oordial welcome and the most hospitable entertainment. EAch of their little villages is posressed of its humble cburch bearing the simple inscription of ' Temple Protestaut.' I found that most of theso Teutonic settlers came from AlAeo. Prussia, Baden, and Switzerland. The colonists in general complain that their lot is a hard one, and that they havemany difficulties to contend against. Still, their descend. ants cannot fail to reap the benefit of their labours. The. soil in many places, when cleared and cultivated, is hibhlyproductive, and I shall give you an idea of the =arlI of the climate when I tell you that for the last month I have. been enjoying green peas, uew potatoes, and even stwraber. nes and amonds, all of this years growth. " The diseases I have found most prevalent among thccolonists and troops here are fevers of every description, smallpox, and ophthalmia of the worst kind T the lastt. generally attacls women and children. No doubt these. diseases will in a great measure disappear as the colonists. become acclimatized and the soil is brought into moregeneral cultivation. " The Government has done all in its power to betteiso. condition of the colonists. Towns and villages have been. laid out with considerable taste and on the most approvec European plans, fortifications have been thrown up to dofend them from any possible attack of the Arabs, with garrisons and outstanding bloc}houses; and such is the strength of these fortifications and the admirable system. of correspondence established among them that the French. Government can now safely defy any attempt on the part or tbe Arabs to recover their lost territory, however general orwell organized. It has even extended its efforts so far as toendeavour to inducemthe aboriginal races to enter the tpe oo civilization by erecting several meat vllages for their use but they, true to their wandoring idstincts sma nomaaic tastes, prefer to dwell with their floclk and hezds under the. tent of their forefathers. The French soldiery, here as lse. vwhero, are employed in works of public utility * the whole of the roads that traverse thiscountry have been oonstrnce by hem, and Ihave met with thousands tus emloed during my teur.

OITYILIe1E?ojj Monday Eveing. TEhe funds to-day have had a better appearance &an at any time during the past three or four weeks. She payments consequent upon ihe 4th of the 3nonth have all been well met, and towards the afternoon there was a general improvement in the aupply of money. Further heavy liabilities fall due tc-morrow, and after these shall have been disdharged there wil be increased ease. The quotation of the rate of exchange from New York, and the lbellef that a portion of the 120,0001. brought by the Niagara is on English account together with the fat of the next Mexican mail oeing expected to hring nother large quantity of silver, also contrilbuted to give firmness to the market. Although the :O0,0001. of goldannouncedlastweekbythe Anglesey Thasnotyet been delivered, there is still an absence of wvithdrawals from the Bank, and confidence is thereaore felt that all danger is over for the present of a renewed reduction in the stock of bullion, especially as the first change of wind is likely to bring several Mew arrivals from Australia. Consols for money (opened at the closing quotation of Saturday-921 to ib and under the influence of various purchases on the part of the public they steadily improved to 93i o ~,at which they remained to the official close. After regular hours there were buyers at 931. For {he 4th of June the last transactions were at 93g. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 213; Reduced 91k to 92; New Three per Cents., 92 to k; india t3kck, 220 to 222; India Bonds, lOs. to 5a. dis'nount-* Exchequer-bonds, 98 to B; and ExchequerhiIa (June), 6E. to 2s. discount;; March, 2s. discount to 2s. premium. :1?oreign securities were generally higher; the rise in some cases was about one-half per cent. Turkish O3ix per Cents. for money were negotiated at 92k 3nd 93; for the account, 921, i, and 93g. In the Sour per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions took -, place at 100 and 100I for money, and 100k for the Tccount. The general bargains comprised-BrazUian -ve per Cents., 991 and 100l ; Mexican, for money, Z ; for the account, 23k; Peruvian Four-and-aHEalf per Cents., for the account, 77 J; Portuguese 'Three per Cents., for the account, 45 and 460; the Three per Cents., 1856, for account, 45k; Russian - our-and-a-Half per Cents, 96; the Small, 97; 33utch Two-and-a-lalf per Cents., 65k; and the IFour per Cent. Certificates, 97i. The corn-market was quiet this morning at the -dvance of Is. obtained on Friday. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. -on the Pais Bourse this evening were 68f. 80c. f.r maoney, and 69f. 10c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of about a quarter per cent., -chiefly upon money purchases. The general advice?, however, show much distrust, together with disappointment, at the results of the various railway miueetings. AtH33nburg the rate of discount has receded to 6A per cent., and on the continent gene- -ally the exchanges have a faivourable appearance for this country. Tt iS affirmed that the Russian railway subscripilon in London has proved an almost total failure. eh applications in France, Amsterdam, and Ger-nany are stated to have been limited and unsatitfactory, but the want of success in this country has Tbeen still greater. The p respects of the silk crop continue to be .4nxIously watched throughout Europe. Great ap3prehensione have been occasioned by the recent severity of the season, but up to the latest dates the accounts are not such as to cause discouragesntnt. According to advices from M. Arles Dufour, <of Lyons, of the 2d inst., a rise equal to betwven 4 and 5 per cent. occurred in the si-market during the last few days of April owing to the cold and -'Threatening weather, but the news subsequently ze* eived from the south of France, ltaly, Naples, :Spain, the Levant, and Greece had notbeen in any degree unfavourable. It was certain, however, that If the cold should continue to check vegetation, even "without frost, the crop would be seriously injured. The reports of the business of the manufacturing ilo-wns for the past week show a general tendency to -dulness. At Mfanchester lower prices have been zxcepted, and in the woollen districts heaviness has 'been caused by the reduction in the staple at the *London ales now in progress. In the iron trade -here has been considerable steadiness. The shipping statistics of the Board of Trade for 4he month ending the 3Lst of March present extra-ordinary evidence of commercial activity. The ariivals were very numerous, and the clearances out'ward were also on a scale to indicate that valuable zoturns, either in specie or produce, must continue due to us. Subjoined are the general figures Entered inward- Tonnae for the Month endin, MWrei ii With regard to the coasting trade, it appearsi that the aggregate capacity of the vessels entered inward in March, 1855, was 872,860 tons; in 1856 it was 954,763; and in the present return it is 988,306 tons, including nine foreign vessels of an aggregate bur-den of 1,717 tons. The clearances outward were -923,034 tons in March, 1855; 999,072 in 1856; nnd 51,065,897, inc.luding 1,936 tons of foreign, The following further memorandum is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders:- " 1he new Mexican conistitution was promulgated on the 1Ith of March last and the Govermnent seized that occasion -to address the nation on the state of its affairs in a 'mani* ~festo' which appeared in the Mexican official journal of the lEth of March, where it fills 24 columns.

REPOrTS ox THE CoLonxm&-A bluo-book of 400 pages, yesterday published, contains a series of official reports elative to our colonial possessions for the year 1855, To.As may be supposed, the information thus derived is both mIscellaneous and hiaily Interestingo ; and it is satisfCtory to find thati genera speaking, the colonies give evidence of beng a T flo, Vg and P u ndition. This is especially the case as regdard =aaa he reports on which refer to the exports of'wheat, the working of the tciprocity Treaty with the United States, land ales, railways, trade, new lighthoues. the Miitia, the Clergy Re. serves Act, and the progress of education. The reports on the AustraBian colonies afford a fund f ugthe m te I Eessions v emoy rovertfonative matter. The total expoDrt of wheat from Canad 1n1855 amounted to 3,193,748 bushels, and of flour to 64%9.36 barrels. The Customs yielded in 1856 1,018,3l24, andi PLblic Works (revenue) 99.5811. The beneficial effects of reciprocal free tradle with the United States are illustrated by some very striking facts and figures. The settlement of the counnt is rapidly advancing, and, in short, the progres of thb colony is most reassuring. To the reports on other cOIOUW po.%sessuionsi we may revert on a future occason,

ZONDON, TUESDAY, MAY 5, 1857. There is something to be said for the garrulous ranibling, inconsecutive class of politicians. They are not a tenth part so boring as the severe men who push a principle into your very vitals. If one must spend half an hour in a shop one would rather it were a general dealer's; if one must pass a day with a child one would rather it prattled as nature and accident, or some mysterious thread of ideas, prompted it, than fnd it an enthusiastic admirer of EEnRY VIII., or absorbed in the history of the -second Punic War. If it is a child, for Heaven's sake let it be a child. Indeed, we may go further -if a man is a fool, it's a thousand pities he should ever try to be anything else. It is not under this last remark, but rather under the general merits of what some narrownminded people call hodge-podge, farrago, rubbish, odds-and-ends, or something as disrespectful, that we class the lucubrations of our old friends the Liverpool Financial Reformers. There is a good deal of the milk of hunan kindness in these gentlemen, they deal so geniiy with the infirmities of their readers. They never weary the intellect or exhaust the -attention, for, as sure as the page turns over, or a new paragraph begins, you are relieved with some refreshing novelty. " Take what you like, gentle- men," they seem to say 7 " here are topics enough for all of you." There are, indeed, topics enough for ten Reform Bills, and as manv Revolutions, Magna Chartas, Bills of Rights, social eompacts, and general reconstructions of society. Here are some of the dishes in this bill of fare Direct taxation-extension of the franchise,impending insurrection and civil war-anomalies of the electoral system-the impropriety of allowing the CBowNr to declare peace and war-the merely nominl authority of the Cnoww and the real domination of an aristocratic oligarchy-self.gover0rent_centralization-the propriety of letting-th6 Ministers of the CRoWN sit without - " atseal bit also without votes-their real posi- tion as prisoners in the dock-the profligacy with -whiTh Prliament votes away public money, and the consquent necessity of giving it absolute control over the public purse-the want of responaible paymatezz--the want of a standing Finallce Committeo, a system of public bookkeeping, and a prompt, effective, and independent audit-a good old Landtaxthe abolition of all Customs and lExcise-tho employment of private ship. builders, armourers, and other manufacturers, instead of having public establishments for these Purposea-the abolition of the Bank of England and the Hudson's Bay Company-the summary punishment of confessed offenders instead of their committal for formal trial-the consolidation of Acts of Parliament-the propriety of leaving " Her " GraciousMA3xsry" to find the PRINCESS RoyA's dowry out of her own pocket-the desirableness of overhauling the accumulations of the Duchy of Cornwall-the wisdonm o requiring Parliament to finish its debates every day before dinner, and allowing the public the next day to present written replies before further business is entered upon; and last, but not least, the wisdom of not paying too much attention to the advice of that very insinuating gentleman now at the head of HER MAJEsrx's Government. Here is a pretty lot of speculative items, enough to gladden the eyes of every political chiffomnier. It takes some raking and turning over to realize the wealth of the heap. To be sure, you'vo to do the sorting yourself, and it is surprising why the industrious fraternity rwho in Paris, before the hour of daybreak, go their rounds with rake, lantern, and basket, and explore the dustheaps, don't turn their bumps of order to some better account. For our part, we give up the sorting. But the topics are all of them so attractive that as fast as we fix upon one another seduces the attention. So, which shall we take first, -the proposition that the QUEN, shall find Miss VICTORA'S pin-money, or that every magistrate may inflict the full penalty of the law on every burglar, poacher, or murderer wjho cannot deny what he has done;. or that the IHouse of Commons shall sit every morning immediately after breakfast to hear what Mfr. ROBerTSON GLADSTON-q has to say on the previous day's speeches? Some of our readers perhaps would rather that we took the general eulogy of our Parliamentary system and the Royal prerogative in the days of the Hsxms, RIcHSARs, and EDWARDS. But we really feel either so ignorant or so hetem. dox on the state of the British Constitution under these dynasties that we must ask our readers to go to the Princess's TheatrzeA where they will probably learn as much as we or the Liverpool Financial Reformers can tell them about the RIxCADus, the REx.rEs, and the EDwARDS. Except, however, that every night Mr. CHRLES KA is deposed as His Gracious ajesty RICHARD 11., the Duke of LcANASTEE auditing his accounts for him, giving him an economical horse, lodgings, servants, and dinners, and finally saving the nation the cost of his further keep, we don't see why these ILancashire gentlemen should be so anxious to revive that period. So, what shall we rest the sole of our foot upon in this lubricous and miscellaneous mass 9 There is the proposal to raise all our revenue by a direct tax on realized property-we beg the gentlemen's pardon-by " an " equitable system of direct taxation." We have challenged them to produce such a system, and we believe they have really published something which they believe to anwer this description; but, if we remember right, it was neither equitable nor practicable, for,while it laid such a tax on house and land as would soon send all our landlords nowhere, it affected to extract from many classes what neither the SULTAN, nor the Grand Inquisitor, nor any power that we are- aware of, could ever extract from them. An eel can be skinned once, and that would be the opration of the "Equitable "System" on the landlords; but a flint cannot be skinned even once, nor could our labourers, domestic servants, and, in general, our " working " clames." Who are the Li"erpool Financial Reformers? Are they a plurality, or sImply Mr. EnOBBRTSON GrADSTONB ? In the Insolvent Debtor' Court one occasionally finds the Commissioner putting such questions as the following :-" We find, Mr. "SMITn , that in the year 1849 you were trading "under the title of ' Mesms. BRicm, SToc; Snp"' SON, JoHiNsow, and Co.,'-who were 'your "real partners?7" Answer;-" I was ftading "on my own account." " We find, in 1853, "that you were trading under the title of ' the "'General Loan, Discount, Mutual Benefit, and "'UniversalAccommodation Company.' Have you "a list of the shareholders I"' Mr. Smr answers, " I was the Company." " We find that in "1855 you were known as ' SmI BBOTnrs, "' general merchants.' What brothers have you ?I Answer.-" One in Australia, but I never had any " business connexion with him." Now, we really are curious to know whether Mr. ROBERTSON GLADSTONE iS one or many. We are under the same difficulty as the simple Hindoos were for a long time as to the nature of the East India Company. 'Aost of them thought it an old lady, and that is the precise suspicion we entertain about Mr. ROBERTSON GLADSTONE. Is he a man, a woman, a thing, a company, a principle, or what ? He need not come to the metropolis. His horror of centralization, and his entire omission of this town from the places which he thinks ought to be more fully represented, seemto imply that ajourneytoLondon would be very distressing to his feelings; but let him publish the names of those who agree with him on the numerous points comprehended in this document. A hundred people all so much of one mind on such a variety of questions would be an extraordinary and really a very encouraging fact. When agreement has gone so far, why should it not be universal? Why should not all raes, colours, and tongues agree to like the same dishes, the same clothes, the same mode of spending the day,-everything. the same, excepting the same sort of wife, which would not be convenient? Suppose that a hundred men could be found all agreeing to prefer the white end of asparagus, a shoulder of mutton to a saddle, the Isle of 'Dogs to the Highlands, St. Margaret's Church to the Abbey, and sO on through a dozen other out-of-the-way instances, 'then it would seem to result that there was no such thing as real taste, sense, opinion, or judgment of any kind, and that the whole was an afeair of wilftul choice. Of course, it is possible that one man may hold the score or two distinct crazes contained in this document; but we doubt whether two men can be found to hold them au. The two, if fairly premsed; wiU be srure to join issUe on somne point or another. Biut, if theyf-isiagree on any one, there is an end of the Liverpool Finamcia Reformers in their associate capacity, if there overs was fsuch a body. '
Births, Marriages, and Deaths never lose their iniportance, and even when classified and indexed and tabulated into statistics still have an interest of their own. For a country like England, which has its ground to hold in Europe, while it replenishes the utmost parts of the earth with a never-ceasing emigration, the reproductive power. of the population is a matter of the greatest mnoment. It is satisfactory, therefore, to learn that, according to the latest rehurns, the Births are proportionally more numerous, and the Deaths proportionally fewer, than at any former time. The Quarterly Returns of Marriages for the last three months of 1856, and of Births and Deaths for the first three months of 1857, have just been combined in one, publication. The results made known are sufficiently gratifying. M2LR.Ua was no doubt right in saying " Tak cam of produc- "tion; population will take care of itself ;0i The Log,islature, and society in general, have abaudoned of late years the idea of encouraging marriage and the birth of children among the poor, and have only been intent on giving those already living free scope for the earning of their bread; yet the object of increasing the population has been indirectly attained, and the luctuations of national prosperity have been constantly followed by an increase or diminution in the number of Births. During the war the number of Marxiages lessened sensibly. In 1854 the pressure was not so much felt, but in the next year there can be no doubt that all classes began to feel the necessity of retrenchment, and that individuals hesitated to undertake new responsibilities until the future became somewhat more clear. This depression made itself felt considerably in the earlier part of 1856, and, consequently, the increase on the whole year is not so large as might have been expected from the return of peace. In 1853, a year of grest prosperity, the' Marriages were 164,520; in 1854 they were 159,727; in 1855 they sank to 152,113; and in 1856, somewhat recovering, they rose to 159,183. We see, therefore, that vwith all the progress of the three years in wealth, trade, and population, the "iumber of couples who chose to accept the responsibilities of matrimony was less in 1856 than three yeara before, a string proof of the depressing effects of war, and the influence which political disturbances have in checking a nation's natural development. Yet, though the Marriages were fewer, the offspring was more numerous. In 1853 612,391 children wereborn; in 1854, 634,405; in 1855, 635,043 ; while in 1856 the Births had risen to 657,704. The fact that the year 1856 was unusually healthy makes the increase of population duing the last twelve months far greater than in any equal period, for not only are the Births more nulmerous, but the Deaths, which had risen to 437,905 for 1854, and 425,703 for 1855, were last year only 391,369. The RIsism n-GrnERA remarks that in 1856 318,366 persons were married, " the number thus " approaching the number of Deaths." The average of the last 10 yeas is one Mariage annually to 119 persons living. To come to the latest dates, we find that in the first three months of 1857 the Births of 170,381 children were registered in England; therefore, as the Deaths were 10$,527, the naturalincreasa of the population of England: and Wales was 61,854.; and the increasein the whole United Kingdom was probably at the rate of 1,000 a-day. Now, if emigration prevail to the same extent as during the last two years, we must make a large deduction on this account. During each of the years 1855 anda1856 about 170,000 persons quitted the British Isles, and, though the greater part of these were Irish, still in any general enumeration they must be reckoned with the population of the other two kingdoms. From the Retumn for the first quarter of 1857 we learn that 35,007 emigrants sailed; and, as the winter quarter does not witness usually so large an emigration as the others, it may be concluded that the exodus for the year will not be less than that of the last. It is probable, therefore, that out of the 365,000 at which the REc4ssTR.AnGmAL rates the increase of population, aliout 165,000 must be subtracted for emigration, leaving 200,000 as the actual increase in the number of human beings likely to inhabit the British isles at the end of the year. Of the 35,007 emigrants who sailed during the quarter it is computed that less than 16,000 were of English origin. It is a singular proof of the larger resources of thece English emigrants that 9,551 of them went to Au#trali. The very poor are naturally unable to undertake this long voyage, and generally are content to seek their fortuxies on the other dide of the Atlantic. When, then, we find that 9,551 English 'went to Australia, and only 6,264 to America, we have a right to believe that enterprise, and not destitution, is the principal cause of emigration in this part of the United Kingdom. It is probable also that a larger proportion than usual of the Irish sought their fortunes in Australia, invited by the demands of the eolonists for more labour. The prioe of food is a matter on which the public keeps so constant an eye that we can hardly hope to copy from the Report anything that shall be new. The great faets are, that corn has fallen and meat has isen. Wheat, which was 72s. 4d. a-quarter in the winter of last year, has fallen to 66s. 10d. in the winter of the present year. But potatoes have risen from 86s. to ilos. a-ton; the price of beef from 5id. to 5id., of mutton from Bid. to 6id. a-pound. Thus wheat has fallen 21 per oent., while potatoes have risen in London 28, beef 10, and mutton nearly 16 per cent. This increase in the price of meat has led to increased importations, which are hardly depressed by the fenr of the murrain which is now raging in some parts of Europe. The Deaths for the first quarter of this year were 108,527, or at the rate of 23 in 1,000, the average rate of the season being 25. Owing to the improvements in sewerage, in the supply of water, ia the constuction of dwell. ingA, as well aa to the restriction on the numbers inhabiting them, the mortality in the great towns has been much reduced; and we had lately to observe that London was proved by statistics to be the most healthy capital in Europe. Yet much remains to be done, as the following figures will show. The annual mortality in the country, in small towns and vilages, was 20 in the 1,000; in the large towns it was 26, or not far from one-third more. As nearly half tho population of Great Britain is concentrated in what may be called large towns, it is evidently a matter of the irst importance to remove those evils which weaken the strength of a town population and haaten them to a premature grave. This is, indeed, the great moral to be learnt from all our statistical retuns. England is every day becoming more and more a hage aggregation of urban communities. The wonderful physical constitution of the race enables it to struggle against deleterious infuences, but it is unwise to trust the policy of non-interference too far. The nation, as a whole, is boundato provide for the healthy growth of its children, and if due pains be taken to constmet and cleanse our everincreasing cities we m, ay hope for a long duration of such progrem as is made known in the present docu.ent.
We are all in the dark about popular superstition. RoBtNsow C(uson was astoumded one morning at the sight of a fobtpriat oif the sand by hia cave, but discovered presently that his solitary domain was nothing less than an isle of call for .savages, who had repairea thither by hundreds to eat each other in the son, time out of mind. Our vestiges of credulity are likely to turn out just as little singular. We thought it rather stagge-- i3g to meet with a genuine tale of witchcraft in the year- 185, but we now find that such things ae all about and around us, and that, instead of one footmark of a megatherium, we may look for whole herds of the most stupendous sawuians as thick and as lively as rhinoceroses in South Africa or buffaloes in the West American prairies. " Spiritualism" has been digested into a science, with its forms, its nomenclature, its inductions, andits rules. It has its corresponding societies, its reports, and even its organ. Penny prints have been established to mome purpose. There is one of these populu iatructors 'ow fore ua deo-oted exclusively to Spiritualism, and, as if framed expressly on the Manchester model, it purports to be a record of "facts" alone. What shape these facts assume our readers shal see in a minute or two; but we shall astonish their minds pretty considerably to begin with, when we say that the place selected for the publication of this prodigious periodical is none other than York1shire. We well remember being impressed vwith the immensity of power attnbuted to a certain winking statue just imported, since it was affirmed to have converted three commercial travellers at the Bull and MIouth; but even that triumph of mystery was nothing compared to the captivation of Yorkshiremen by Spirit-rapping. Here is the case, however, set forth and symbolized in the Yorkshire Spiritua Tdegraph and BritWis Harmonial Adocafe, sixteen octavo pages, price 1d., frona which journal of marvels we collect such a notion of systematized credulity as few people are likely to have formed for themselves. We cannot say that the manifestations of "Spiritualism" have been developed into any novelty of form. They are still confined to Ihapping and Table-turning, but the advance of the sciencei has been accompanied by some notable refinements of observation. Spirits have their own styles of knocking, like other visitors, and a strange Spirit can be detected by its rap.' Tables, too, are lifted as 'well as turned, and they occasionally parade the room, or perform their steps in more regular measure than of old. The hands of Spirits have been senBible to the touch, and sometimes even visible, wrhile inanimate objects other than tables have been set in motion. The meetings of the initiated in this science are termed " circles," and the iSiirithmzZ Telegrapph duly reports proceedings at Sandgate Circle and at " Charing-cross Circle " (London)." By the way of bringing every ray of scattered light into an intellectual focus, other incidents or matters of a " spiritual" tendency are alEo recorded,-such as stories of a " Spirit seen "leaving the Body," a " Haunted House in Not" tinghamshire, " " Bird Omens, " " Ominous "Sounds," and " Premonitions." When to these chronicles are added judicious extracts of similar character from American journals, the result, as will be easily imagined, becomes very striking indeed. The following passage is from the " first leader" of our contemporary, and is not undeBerving of the prominence assigned to it, although borrowed from another periodical. A " Medium!"-that is to say, a person tbrough whom communion with Spirits is practicable-had arived from Flotence with some " new effect," transcending all former exhibitions, and it was requested that he would be good enough to call up DATE:- " Thepreeencsof the latter was immediately made manifest by the written answers returned to the questions of the inquirer, and Mr. B- then sked the Medirm to request the great ialian to make himself ktialc/ Presently thera aros, as if from the ground beneath the table, twolong thin yellow hands, unmistakeable as to their Itsian origin, undeniable as to their haying belonged to a student and a gentleman. While the asembly was yet guing in beth. less awe, and maybe something of terror lkewis, the hands floated away, orwererather borne, as it wre,eaross the room, and rose to the marble console opposite, upon which stood a vase containing an orange-tree in bloDom. The hands slowly and softy, without noise, but visibly to All, plucked from the stem a sprig of orange-flower with its leaves and buds, and, returning to the table, paused above the head of Mzs. B-, the poet's wife, herself an exquisito and beau. tiful poet likewise, and, placing the sprig upon her raven hair,'disappeared gradually from sight, seeming once more to sink to the floor." Poets seem to be rather favourites in these " circles," for at one of them, " in a house where " we had been having," says the report, " a good " many strange movements of the table," Bumis signified, his spiritual presence in a most decided manner. " One--evening," proceeds the reporter, " after having seen a. great many extraorninary "lifts, by the fable frequently sp'inging from the "floor to a great height, and in that manner "keeping time to tunes, Ac., with an understand"ing that the performer was the spirit of BunMs, "the poet, the company had nearly all retired, leaving only the Mledium, her father, and myself "at the table." Struck, presently, with a spontaneous movement of this piece of furniture, the reporter exclaimed,-" If thiz is rely the spirit "of 3uRNCs, will he be kind enough to gratify me "by a movement of the table 'without humau "touch 4" So polite a request proved naturally irresistible. " Almost immediately afterwards it "(the table) commenced cracking, as if a heavy " weight had been pressing upon it, and it then "gave a sudden rush on the floor, perhaps to the "distance of a foot, when it stopped." " Decep"tion of any kind," it is added, "was imDos"sible." At another meeting ofthe same " circle" a woman " very serioualy requested" that if the Spirit present was thst of her first husband " ha wo;uld convince her by making the table walk " on the floor towalrd her. Strange to say, this " request was also granted, the table commencing "to travel towards her very beautifully and "regularly, stopping when it got close to her. "She again requested that, if her husbaud could, "he would t-hrow the table over on her knee, "which was also accomplished by the table up"setting itself into her lap." At a " circle" held in Kent one evening the operations of a Spirit took a form more analogous to the living realities of legerdemain-A" a watch, chain and all," having been whisked away " by an unseen power" from one personto another. Whose spirit it wasthatreproduced itself in this little trick does not seem to have been inquired. We omit the Bird Omen, for, although " well "authenticated by a friend," and vouched for by the CJhristian Spiritt6ulist, there is a certain vaguencss in a story of which the scene is laid in " Con" waj, Ms.," and the time is " some years ago." Neither shall we enter into the case of the clock in Elizabeth-town, New Jersey, which struck without being wound up, and announced an outbreak of smallpox; but the subjoined article from the New Yor*kXpiti.al Tegraph, upon "Playful or MIs" chievous' Manifestations," is at once so suggestive in its assumptions, so discriminative in its views, and so philosophical in its argument, as to deserve quotation entire " There are numerous records of affairs of this kind (i. e,, such,manifestations as are described in the heading); they doubess many times are to be traced to the influence of undeveloped Spirits, but probably much oftener than we I appose they may be caused by a mere love of fun in Spirits, whes niirhfulnee is very large, sad conse quently predominating; or they way be, in many cases, designed to teach somie lesson to affet oertain temperaments which could reot Otherwise so well be affete, or to reach conditions' which could best be reached by such'means. But whenever they occur the best thing wo can do is to examino "carefully all the circumstnces,' to study them philosophically, and then, if there seems to be actual mischief intended, to heck it by a strong exertion of willpower, which, a greatly undeveloped Spirit Cannot resist from one in a higher condition. Ms. nnauh Bipley, of Shutesbury, relates a little oircumstance which may properly come under this head. Some years ago, as her family were aIl seated round tho fire one evening, speaking of witches, they mentioned the name of an old woman near by who was reputed to be a witch, when her brother ex. claimed; with an oath, that, 'if she bwas awiteb, he wished she mightmanifest herselito him in some way.' No sooner bad he spoken than a small potato-kettle that stood in the corner started wiUhou t any pbysical force, made a circuit ons sweep round the room, and stopped beside him where he sat, to the uttei astonishment of all present." Well, we doi@.t kmo)v what circulation we are to anticipate for our contemporary among the very wideawiake population of the North and West Iidings, but, as Englishmen are a dccidedly prac- tical people, we suggest that spiritualsm should be "deieloped" as soon as possible into someomore uge' phase Thq4 'it occupies at premant, i it will.promote the interests of science to suppose t'hat tables can really be turned,, we are willing to assume as much, in despite of Professor FaADAY's demonstration to the contrary. No doubt, the powers of steam and magnetism. once appeared as mnarvellous, but there is this remarkable distinction in their eaes-that as soon as they did appear they 'were turned to account and impressed into the service of man. Do the same with Spirit Power, and we wiU thankfully accept the new agent, even if the sphere of its operations should be comparatively circumscribed. It would be something to get one's hat off the peg by an effort of volition, without going to fetch it or troubling a servant; and if Table Power could be made to turn even a coffee-mill it would be so much gained; but wo decidedly object, both as Eaglishmnen and economists, to the waste of an this power in evening "c eircles," and to the expenditure of what ought to be a convertible form of macbinery upon nothing at alL As to Clairvoyance, there is a little distich ringing in our head -which seems very like truth itself * lairvyanoe.,omeans the art of seeing tbrough "Thoem who*re not sharp enough to see through yotu But, if this is a calumny, let it bo iet mide; only, as in the former case, let us have our secondmight applied to gooc purpose.

Inltead of calling up DAN, let them call up the winner of the next Derby; instead of entering into conmunication with WABnINGTON, let thema tell us what OUTRA3M is doing in the Persian Gulf, or YL% at Canton; and if this kind of intelligence is purveyed we shall be prepared to see the circulation of The 7lmes itself very soon eclipsed by that of the Yorkshire Spirituia Tle9rapli.

TrE HOmoun oF Ntw Yonrz.-The barbour of New York is the most important haven on the seacoast of the United States; and yet so little care has been taken :of it th its present oonditimi prom4s little for the fature prosperity of our city. We have had legal enactmenta Cnough to protect our harbour from every encroahment tending to destroy its ealIe; but the report lately mado by the commissioners to our Ieislature shows thbt these enactments have been condstntly -violated in every msnner, even by thone whose interests are naturally opposed to anything which can harass or destroy the commnere of New York. Upon this oommerce the pro6perity of our metropolis and of all the adjacent country depends; and yet thesimplestphysical or economical causes can destroy it. These causes are already at work, and unless their progren be arrested, and the suggestions of the commissioners wrho have investiated them oe heeded, we may believe that the dlsy is not fxr distant 'hen tho commercial greatness of New York, having passed its zenith, will 4eelne and fall rapidly into decay. The same caues t.hat destroyed the commerce of Venice and transferred its maritime trade to Trieste, that de¢srozed the commerce of Bristol and transferred ita muartinme trade to Liverpool and other neighbouripg ports, ar ready to work the commercial ruin of our own netropolis To those who have Dever given a thought to this aubject i may seem absurd to predict tbe possibility of such an event But it must be remarked that the only stimulus to commerce is individual gain, and just in proportion as this gain is diminished by any local infIuences, 4 will commerce decay. The trade of New York is not encouraged or maintained by the mere fat that thereis an eAsy access to oUr city from the ocean; nor that we have an ample harbour secure frem storms; nor that 'we have eon'enient communications with a fertile country in the rear These are physical advantages possessed by many other seaports on our coast. But, these existing, it is necessary, Sn order to attact and sustain commerce, that there should alEo exist onomiali adanag" in a corresponding degree. If we have a good harbour and destroy it, or allow it to go to ruin, or if we impose burdensome taxes upon aU the pro perty seeking shaven here, we arc certainly insuring our own commercial destruction. Novw, how iS it, in these respects, with theharbour of low York? The report ofth Commissioners on Harbour Encroachments, to 'which we have alluded, gives u reliable information. Wefindevidswe that local abuses of ver-ry kind exist in this harbour, 'wboee aggregate is imposingaheavy tax upon all the ships and inr. chandiesoekingthisport. Prcmnentamon ithese as ses connected with theyiers and docks of the city. No adequate provision is made either for the accommodation oEt shiping or forthereceiptanddelivery of goods landed on the whaf. It is etimatedIhat an average of 300 veu are alwa awifting inthis port for berbs. This inacdes only th -legeclun of ve,** on mhiclt t'he lol, lrom inablaiyo load or dischage their estimated at $S0 *day sash, -is $9,000 a-day, or $2700,iOV0 a-year, of SO working das I But this is tal;ng- no account of interest and other losses on the cagoes of- these vessels caused y this detention. So disastrous is this loss that it is frequently repreented-ly both foreign aud domestic siippers indsbipowners as a. serious objection to coming to this port, and on this account ike trade of othor cities has been lrgely increased at con experse. Nor is this to be wondered *, for ther are other losses besides those arising from this peeps. tual detention. Lawletnes and iith reign sp"sue on our wharf, and every cargo landed on the fql anddilapidated fiers which fringe the East sad 'e2tIL rivers is moreor iessinjured by thiese camses. The tftU. inouy ta'kenby the commissioners upon this, sdbjet is that flour is generallt damaged a shilling a barrel, and pot -w4 pearl asfhes, whisky, and mimiar articles ar r tdored les mrhatable by being deposited on these piers. Nor iti tha onlyevil. All property thus deposited is cAno tly *-eposed to the depredations of thieves and pirates 'who swarm likelocusts aboutite sbutmentsof the rivers.

AMERICA. 'fA summary of the following, received by electric tele. Graph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday :-] LIVERPO0, MoN-oDAY. The Royal M1ail steamship Niagara arrived this aorning, with advices from New York to the 121st ult., Boston to the 22d, and Halifax to the 24th. Sbe has brought $581,083 in specie on freight, of which $301,285 are for Havre. The screw steamship City of Washington, from Liverpool, and the Fulton, from Sout0mampton, had narrived out; the latter vessel had $1o0,00O on *reight. The usual telegraphic despatch Vid Halifax had -mot come to hand, owing to the wires having been 4lisplaced by a severe storm. The steam-frigate Niagara had been detained at :ew York ou account of the storm and for want of 'water to cross the bar; she drew 27 feet. The ,Courier and Enqauier makes rather a surprising atatement. It says,- "In order to economize the use of coal, which is rendered necessary in order to reserve asulficient bupply against any accident that may occmjwhile the operation of laying the tegrapbi cable is' in progress, sheZwEiperform the passage ro Londn phincpally yb the aid of sails. Another report of the same date says, " The steamtfrigate Niagara remains at anchor off Govermor's Island, a(nd will proceed to sea the first favourable -opportunity." A telegraphic despatch from Washington, received -at Boston, states that instructions had been sent by the George Lavr for the United States' Equadron at the Isthmus to hold itself in readiness for any -emergency that might arise. It was understood that the United States' steamers in the West Indies 'would also proceed at once to join the squadron at the Isthmus. It was said Government would make -one more effort to arrange the pending difficulties by megotiation, but, failing this, the United States would $proceedto takepessessionof bothsidesoftheIsthmus, :Oiplomatic relations had been suspended with the -2Granadian Government. The British and foreign iNSisters at Washington had been informed of the intended action of the American Government. The Vew York oourier and FAwtirer publishes some information from its Washington correspondent respecting Central America. He writes:- " The formation of a treaty with Mexico upon the model of that made by Mr. Forsyth is now under consideration. "The chief design is to secure to the Government of the United States the Tehuantepec transit route. To this end -some provision will be made for an advance of money in order to sustain Comonfort's Administration. Mr. Forsyth wUll probably be retained untilthis delicate business shaU be -cornpleted. No money can be paid, of course, from the American Troasury until any treaty that may be made -shall be confirmed by the Senate; but the stipulations for a pecuniary supply wil doubtless be thrown into such shape as to form the basis of an advance by the foreign bankers of the Mexican capital sufficient to meet its present necessities. .`Mr. Hargous, Senor Atocha, Mr. Ward, and other large claimants upon the Mexican Government are here, doubtless -with a view to protect their intere-ts in the pending -arrangements. Tho general subject of Isthmiau communications between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has been iso discussed in Cabiiet. A force of four or five larqe vessels, with at least 200 guns, will be ordered to the Pacific for the special service of keeping open the line of travel * and mail transportation. That of the Panama Railroad v7ill need protection from the returning Filibusters, as well as the native population, incensed by the excesses of the former. The American and British Company which has undertaken the construction of the Honduras RAil'way are proceeding in tho work with judgment an-i energy. The length of this route is estimated not to exceed 160 miles. It may be completed in four years. The Companyhaveinvited Governor Gear3 to ake charge of this important enterprise. The statements that the waggon road ever the Teluantepee route is completed must be taken vwith many grains of salt. There wa a contract for a plank road, 'whle is theoredtcally executed. This is a poetic license, as -not a plank has been laid, but a practical highway has been openen, over which a buggy laden with Mr. Pickett, the consul, has triumphantly passed. The Government Is wil'ing to accept this or any other excusoe for continuing the privilegesof the contract, that being judged necessary to the maintenance of favourable relations with the United States. As the invaders of Nicaragua awe by this time expelled or. exterminated, that country must soon come under the operation of the DaUas and Clarendon treaty. It will bo the first duty of the British -nd American Governments to unite with those of the other Central American Statee to regulate the affairs of {his regionin such amanneras iUlrepair, sofarasposdble, the evis caused by the late war. It wil probably be for the intorests of aU the States to abandon the plah of partitioning Nicaragua, and leave herto the protection of the treaties between the powerfulnations who have now assumed the relation of advisers and protectors. There is no other possible mode of settling the affairs of the country than by a sysbem of active and enlightened intervention. Thefirst duty of the United States is to offer an adequate compensation in money for the outrages of our oitizens, who have devastated and ruined Nlc4ragua in the vain attempt to conquer it. It should then restore to the Trasit Comupany its property and business, and adopt the necessary measures to protect this channel of communication from future interruptions." The New York State Legislature had passed a Bill declaring in effect that no slaves shall be bought within the boundaries of the State, thus nullifying, as far as possible, the recent decision of the Supreme {3ourt in the Dred Scott case. The establishment of a line of telegraph from New York to San Francisco was contemplated. Two executions according to Lynch law had taken place in Iowa. In both cases the condemued had committed murder. The following despatches from the Colonial-office had been read in the Newfoundland Legislature, and were received with markg of approbation:- " Downing-street, March 26. Sir,-I have to acknowledge your despatches of the numbers and dates speCfied,-No. 8, 7th of February, 1857; No. 11, 3d of MarcZ ; No. 12, 4th of March; lNo. 13, 5th of March. When Her Majosty's Govermmnent entered into the convention with that of France which has formed the occasion of that correapondence, they did so in the hope of bringing to a sat factory arrangement the many complicated and diffioult questions which havearisen between the two countries on the subject of the Newfoundland fisheries. But they did so with the full intention of adhering to two principles which have guided them, and wi'l continue to guide them-namely, that the rights at present enjoyed by the comnmunity of Newfoundland are not to be ceded or exchanged without their assent, and that the constitutional mode of submitting noasures for that assent is by laying them before the Coloilll eg'Isltue For this reason they pursued the samne orm of proceeding /which had eaten btfore pursued in the case of the Xeciprocity Convention with the United States, and which was in that case adopted and acted upon by the Newfoundland Legislature. It was ia perfect uniformity with the sa1e precedent that it appeared necessary in the greaent instance to add a condition respecting Parliamentaryenactment, in order that, if necessary, any existing Sobsacles to the arrangement in the series of Imperial statutes m ight be subsequentlv removed. The proposals contained in the convention having been now me uivocally rsfused by the colony, they 'will, of course, failto the .ground; and you are authorized to give such assurance as you may think proper that the consent of the comuu unity of o ewoundland is regarded by Her Majesty's Government as the essential preliminaryv to any modifications of their -territoria or m aritime righlts. ,, ~~~~" I have, &o., "Governor Darling, &c.

THE " URGNT" OF THE ADMIRALTY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-To my astonishment I see in Dhe Times this morn. ing, under the head of " Naval and Military Intelligence," that the last voyage of Her Majesty's new steam troopship Urgent to Barbadoes, with the 49th Regiment on board, is characterized as " a good passage from Spithead." She left that port on the 28th of February, sprang a dan. gerous leak in the middle of the Bay of Biscay, put into Corunna on the 3d of March in a half-sinking state, and would certainly have foundered, but for calm weather and the daring act of an assistant-engineer, who repeatedly, at the risk of his life, set free the valves of the engine-pumps at a time when the water had risen to within a few inches of the fires, and when the deck-pumnps were found totally insufficient, though worked for hours. In caseof extremity her boats would not have held one-third of the number of men on board. She put into Madeira on the 9th, took up her screw in the trades, put her screw down again wfien the trades fell light, broke some of the engine gear almost immcdiately after, took 24 hours to repair tried again, and snapped again. Finally went iato Carlisle-hay ne ;lo the 27th of Mfarch under ail on If this be a "good pa?sage from Spithead," I should be glad to know what an indifferent one would be like. As the vessel was " hourly expected at Spithead," there will, I presume, unless she again disappoint her friends, be an immediate opportunity for some one on board to give a complete overhauling to the statement of Your obedient sPvnt n 4 LOOK-OUT. London, May 4. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIIIES. Sir,-Perhaps you may think the enclosed account of the last trip of the Urgent, with the 49th Regiment on board, worthy of insertion. It is from one of the officers of the regiment. T 2.., . Dagenham, Essex, May 3. " Barbadoes, April 6. I shall give you an account of our chapter of accidents from the time we left Portsmouth. For the first two days all went on very well, and we were looking forward to a quick passage; on the third morning the Captain reported to the Colonel that thero were 8 feet of water in thehold, and thab the pumps would not work. We then set about cleaning all t e boats and getting ready a raft, an the boats would only hold 300 men, and we had 800 on board. Fortunately, after much trouble, we got the pumps to work before the fires were put out by the water, which had rin to within, a few inches of the stokehole. At "hf time we wvere 90 miles from Cornnna, which was the nearest, port. The ship's head was immediately put round, and all the pumps being manned we set heSAiy:to work, as you may suppoee. The sea wau quite smooth, so we managed to get intoport next mornmg. After two days we again started, and reached Madeira without accident. After leaving Madeira all went very weU for two or three days, when one night about 12 o'clock the engines broke down and we had to saiL After a few days they were set to work again, but after working very uneasily for a few hours they stopped again. The screw had worked a large piece of iron from one ot the plates at the ship's stern.

The report of the committee, after referring to the circumstance that the city improveneats in the valley of the Fleet have had the effect of overcrowding the courts and alleys of Clerkenrwell, rendering both the moral and physical state of the inhabitantsworse than before,went on to give the following details of the working of the schools and of their accessories :-There are at present on the hooks of the boys' day school 128 pupils, with an average daily attendance of 80 ; the girls' day school has 180 pupil, with 75 in daily attendance; another infant school is at present required, as there are upwards of 40 infants tryin to et admission into the existing one, which is already full: in it 85 infants are under daily care and in. Ltruction. In the weekly evening school there is an average attendance of 50 boys and 80 girls. Thu morning Sunday school is attended by 42 boya and 38 girls; that in the afternoon by 07 boys, 98 girls, and 77 infant4and the eveng one by 67 boys and SO girls The childen educate min these schools and sent into the world to earn theown bread were without exoeption condactingthemselves well, and 31 of them obtaied prizes rom the Aged School JUnion in reward for their good e haviocr. Attached tothese schools is a maternity and relief society, which last year relieved 95 eoor women, and affordedmedical attendance to 11 in their travaiL There are also a mothers' instruction class, with 85 names on the book and 30 in attendance, a working man's institute, a Sabbath evening devotional service, with an average attend. ance of 40, and a clothing fond for the encouaement of provident habits among the parents of the children attendiag the schools, and in which they eta bonus of Sd. on every shillin tboy invest. The nobleChairnan, after the secretary had read the report, said that he presumed there was no one present who -would expect that he should enter into any dicussion on the merits of these schools. On that Suestion they were all agreed and prepared to lend them their support. It was vezy easy to start upon any vast scheme of usefulness or labour. They had on the one band, wvhen they undertook anything new, the difficalty which necessitated it, and which no doubt looked larger to them from its very nearness; and they had, on the other hand, to stimulate them to overcomeit, all the bright. ho pi of the future. But it too frequentl hbp3nod thiat whn they found their work accomplis edand the institution flourishing, they witbdrew fronm it that sapport and oountenance which they lent it in its early struggles, and thus in course of time it fell into decay'. He hoped, however, that such would not be the case with respect to these seools. It was, however, perplexing to the supporters of them to fEnd circumstances creating difficultles in their path which they could never have anticipated. He made th"i observation on account of the allusion in the report to the overroiwding of the neighbourhood by reason of the pulling lown the streets and lanes in which the poor formerly re;ided, and which was an illustration that thre ws no benefit which had not an attendant evil. The result Af this crowdin of famiHes into one room, and this ,ominrngling of the sexes without raw regrd to lecenoy, was a fearful state of things botf phbycally moraUly, and religiously, -which it was lacuinbeist on 'hem to try and remedy. Indeed, it was er of the best signs of the times that men, however much they might JifrTer in other respect, were agreed ini is that the Eirt lnty which Parliament owed to the people of the metropolis was the considering of those measures best alculated to Improve their sanitary condition. The result of the worldng )f the socools and their auxiliary ageits h this dirction. was a cheering one, and it was also sabisfactory to find that they -were ab-e to reclaim so many ahidTen from po)verty and suffering, and to enable them to.tske their place in the honest part of the community, and notb less satisfar,tory to learg how, through the agency of these chilren, they ifittCaced their parents for gooad.

TJE UNITED S3TATE. (FROM OB OWIN COMMSPPOrDmT.) NEW YORK, Apra 2L The State Legislature of New York adjourned OI the 18th, having passed 650 Bills, public and private, in a sesaion of 100 days. The most importanl are the Acts by which the municipal charter of the city of New York is amended and the systen oi police remodelled. Old New York is as unwilling tc be reformed as the Corporation of London, and threatens to resist the innovations as "unconstitutional." The Republican party predominates in the Legislature of the State, while the city is still under the swav of the democracy; the country has carried the new Bills against the influence of the city, which protests against provincial interference, with its abuses. It is said the validity of the new Acts will be tested in the courts of law, which would be equivalent to throwing the government of the city into Chancery, and leave it for some time withouG any legally constituted authorities at all, or plunge it into a conflict between the new system and the old. The placid public, that does nothing in these contests but look on and pay the costs, is, in its sluggish 'way, favourable to the changes, on the ground that no possible change could be for the worse, and some of them appear to be real improvements. But the professional rulers, who take all the work of self-government out of the hands of the community, are more active, antlfrom them come the threats of resistance. The State Senate devoted the last moments before the adjourn. ment to passing a series of resolutions, founded- on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dred Scott, and intended as a protest against it. It resolved that the State of NewYork "will not allow slavery within its borderi1 in any form, or under any pretence, or for any time, however short ;" it also declares that the Supreme Court of the United States has, by its decision, identified itself with " a sectibnal and aggressive party," and "impaired the respect and confidence the people of the States " felt in it. At the meeting of the Town council and Board of Aldermen yesterday the threats of resistance to the new order of things took a more definite shape; the aldermen empowered the mayor to retain possession- of all property belonging to the present Police Department, and to refuse obedience to any orders of the new police commioners created by the Act. The councilmen directed the legal adviser of the corporation to examine the new Acts and make a report on them, and obtain if necessary other professional opinions upon their validity; all the municipal officers, till such report is received are instructed to do nothing that can be construae into an acceptance of the new charter, and if any attempt is made to enforce it, or any part of it, resistance is to be made in the courts of law, 'which wilL at all events, secure delay. A sum of money is to be voted froxn the city funds to defray the first expenses of consultations and readings, and at this point the matter rests. The next movement will probably take all parties into the regions of quo warranto and m,ausdamus, into which the courage to follow them, even in anticipation, utterly fails. Nothing further has transpired with regard to the Chinese mission. Mr. Reed is preparing for his departure, or ratber the dockyards are preparing the frigate in which he is to sail, which will be one of the finest in the American navy. Mr. Reed will leave about the beginning of June. The case of the persons arrested here on the charge of defrauding the French Northern Railroad Company is not yet decided. The question pending is whether their offence renders them liable to extradition under the treaty. It came on again a few days since, and may be considered near its termination, as Carpentie, one of the accused, pleaded guilty, and is to be admitted States' evidence by the prosecution against his fellow-prisoners. The rumours of two brilliant victories gained by Walker over the Costa Ricans at Rivas have not been confirmed by the arrival of the Tennessee. Nothing is knowpi of the movements of the force on the Pacific side of the Isthmus. But, as has been the case after all the reports of victories in that quarter, the Tennessee brought a perfect budget of disasters that have occurred to the detachment of Walker's men which has been confined to the Atlantic side by the occupation of the River San Juan. When the previouaaccountsleft, Lockridge, with his recruits, was preparingto ascend the river and to. force a passage by taking Castillo, an attempt in which Colonel Titus so snly failed. The expedition left Punta Arenas in the John Scott steamer, but on arriving at the fort found the Costa RIcans had so strengthened it by outiworks and barricades that any attack on it with such a force was impossible. Lockirdge, therefore, retired, and, despairing of the success of any further efforts on the Atlantic side, resolved to attempt to reach Walker by the way of Panama. He called on the men, after thev were rP-sm,ahfrl in ^-n- tne rnver, to volunteer for the enterprise; about a hundred offered to go with him, but 200 refused, consideringthe whole case desperate. Those who refused were, luckily for themselves, put on board a small iron steamer that accompanied the John Scott, and followed her down the river. They were approaching Serapique on the 2d of April, when the John Scott, with the Walker volunteers on board, ran on a sandbank, and in a few minutes afterwards her boiler exploded. Thirty men were instantlykilled, and 50 others wounded and scalded. The ateamer became a wreck and smank in 8 feet of water. The iron boat took the survivors on board; the wounded were placed in a large launch and towed down to Punta Arenas, several dying on the way. Lockridge escaped by being in the fore-part of the boat at the time; his second officer General Wheat, " an old Miwsissippi traveller," with a ractised earfor explosions therefore, iumped overboard at the first auspicious crack, and saved him. self; others were blown Into the water and escaped, but eight officers and the engineer are among the killed. The latest return gives the number of those Idlled and mising at 30, and the total of the casualties at 85. On the arrival of the boat at Punta Arenas the surgeons of the English squadron were sent on shore with proper appliances, and did their utmost to' lessen the sufferings of the scalded men, an act of humanity which the local reports gratefully record. Thoee of the sick and wounded who were m a condition to be moved were put on board the Tenneasee and brought on to New York, where they landed in a miserable state of destitution. They were relieved by a promptly raised subscription, and those who have no friends or connexiona in New York will be sent to their homes by free passes on the railways. As the "army" thus melts away by failure, desertion, starvation, fever, and steamboat explosions, the quarrels of the officers about rank and precedence increase, and there appear to bo colonels and generals enough left on the Isthmus to furnish a full division, though the number of men remaining on the Atlantia side canot exceed 150. The Niagara frigate, which has been detained for some days by an accident to her engines, and, since the damage was repaired, by bad weather, will sail tomorrow for England to. take on board a portion of the Ocean Telegraph eable.

THE PBESENr STATE GP THE HNEY-MA4 EET TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Though the great majority of persons who pay the sightest attention to what is going on m publio affairs appear to be thinking more of new reform bills than anything else, I would most respectfully submit to you that there is one subject which requires tho immediato attention of ParHament before everything else, and that Is the present stato of the money-market. I am not one of those who are in any way embarked in trade or commerce, beyond the fact of possessing a considerable amount of railway shares-a kind of property which is very generally approved in the present day, and therefore, personally, it matters little or nothing to me whether the money-market is tight or easy; but I would only ask those persons who have paid the slightest attention to . this subject how can the trade and commorce of this great commercial empire be carried on when money is so scarce as to demand a rate of interest of from 63 to 7 percent. for short bills, and even more than this, in very many instances, for wvhat, I believe, are termed first-class bils ? It is a most extraordinary thing that no Government will ever grapplo with this very important question,-viz., the currency,-and if something is not done before very long I beHeve there will be almost as great a smash as there was inathe year l826. Our monetary sysatm is ful of anomalies and absurdities. What can be a greater absurdity than this,-that Ireland and Scotland, countries under the same Parliament and same Government as England, should have a different currency to England? We know that the journey can be performed from London to Dublin in about 13 hours, and from London to Glasgow or Edinburgh in aboutl2hours, and yet any one coming from Ireland or Seotland into England must change aU his money. Why should not the notes of the Bank of Ireland be a legal tender in England, the same as the notes of the Bank of England are a legal tender in Ireland 7 I would much rather at any time be possessed of five ll.-notes of the Bank of Ireland, if they would pass in England, that one 51.-note of the Bank of England. It would be welL indeed, if the members for the city of Dublin would bring this question before the House. Bft the great evil of our present system of maoney laws is this:-It is the constant large fluctuations in the quautity or amount of the circulating medium. All large debts are contracted and paid for in Bank of England paper; and if the note circulation is contracted or reduced by several millions, of course every one's portion must also be reduced, and then merchants and tradesmes. have not the same means afforded them of meeting their engagements. Let us suppose thaf it requires a certain stream of water to turn a watermill. If that stream becomes swollen by a great fall of rain it requires floodgates to, let off the superlinous water, or the stream wil overfbw its banks and cause plenty of bubbles (which, as Johnaon says, is "s alytling which wants soldity andlirmnessl' in every direction. If, on the other hand, the stream becomes contractei for want of a sufficient supply of water the mill is baught to a standstill for want of watm, to turn it. So it is with the circulating medium i if there is a considerable expansion in our bantnltes, aU sort& of commercial bubbles are set afloat; and if, on the otherc hand, the Bank circulation is contracte?3 or reduced, the commercial mill or wvbeel is brought to a. s'andstiU because there is not a circulation to grind it, as ik* the money, of the country that turns the great commeaci wheel of i;aat country; and unles there is a judicious. plaun adopted for regulating the amount of the circulatire medium this AFt commercial wheel wil at times be broughkalmost to a stand for want of flat circulation which reaft propert3 e o wkich1 have to be bartere 3 or'exchangedX g5 Of VIa Ag, if there is any pcon *hose pubs sormetimes beats at 40; or 5C ana someti' as at, 100cor IMdoctorawould telb us thatthat man hadl complaint lat. the heart, and, unless they can manae to, reolate the -poh3ss in all probablli)y the patienlt ullg dia sndenly somo&dy, iNowift weab | to compare Engl as,n resemoliag a huma-n being, aurj the Bank o England ie th heart, a1 the circulation-tIt is, the notes sent out Uy the Banlr,-'ao the blood whix flows. through the veinWs and avieries, what have we got?

I IART TBREA S' EXIBITION. (FBOM OUR OWr kEPOER.) MAICHESTER, MAir 4. Tie arrangements for the great event of to. morrow have advanced so rapidy during the past fortnight as to leave not the lemt zhade of alarm on the minds of those connected wi-th. them lest all should not be concluded and in order at the required moment. Oat of the ctos of prep=ations which seemed to prevail so, recently in every portion of the Exhibiti3n' Pahae the diligent and almost incessant labolcs. of the numerous heads of departments and thekefficiext corps of subordinates quickly made appwrent the eertainty of completion. within the time speibd of everything necessary to the grand result. S eonfident of the general progress were some of those officially concerned in the work that the opeaing. of the Exhibition even a week ago was not considared an impossibility. Rowever, a more deliberate and careful termination of so many aimultaneous proeedings-was, of course, more conducive to the satisfactory state of affairs which, now presents itself. The remsrk has frequently been made during the last month, by persons who have had experience of the difficult preliminaries attending on such vast collections of, wealth and mignHieence as have now become almost annual events, that tlio arrngements for the imichester Exhibition wer& mucj more advanced than those of any that have , preceded it had been withinthe same time. An inspection of the various depart. mentsto-daymkes itevidentthat what bas beendone in time that was considered so ample for the purpose has been doneeffectually, and that nothbig beyonda few finishing strokes are now wanting to complete t.he enterprise which is to attract millions of admirers, and wvll to-morrow be inaugurated with so much splendout. The walls of the great central. hall are now filled with that unrivalled display. of British portraita which is one of the great distinctions of this Exhibition. The space between the walls Is now completely furnished with the various components of the general museum,the glass cases filled with costly rarities; the armoury, which is said to surpass any other in England, except that in the Tower, and the long lines of sculpture, at Present shrouded in protecting& canvass, but all arranged in their proper order. The great area is filed in every part with its treasured coutents, and no space is left unoccupied except what is necessary for the paseage of crowds of visitors. In anticipation of to-morrows ceremonial the central passage is already flanked from end to end with several rows of seats, multitudes of chairs fill every available opening, and at the intersection of the nave and transepts, and sr rounding the dais to which Prince Albert and his suite will be conducted, the ground-floor is now covered, and the galleries above Will this evening be furnished vith the requisite accommodation for such a great assemblage of spectators as is counted upon. Provlsion has been made for 9,000persons, and it is confidently reckoned that 7,000 will be present. The great orchestra at the west end is all ready to receive the 500 musicians who have been engaged for the occasion; and rising above it is the grand organ, graceful in its form and its decorations, and flanked by portraits ef Her Mlajesty and Prince Albert. The roof of this end of the building is adorned with banners, briliantly. coloured, in3cribed with the names of great artists, and bearing, also, the arms of the different countrie-v which have given birth to them. The long side galleries of ancient and modern pictures want only such completeness as a few hours will give them ; the water-olours are nearly all placed ; the Oriental Court appears quite in its destined order ; and the photographs, engravings, and mriniatures are being hung with great raPidity in those portions of the various galleries where, from one cause or another, the concluxion of the work has been delayed till almost the last moment. It may be mentioned, in conclusion of this brief summary, that the police arrangements are such as to leave no fear of order being preserved throughout the city and all along the line of route by wrhich Prince Albert will proceed to open the Exhibition, and which, no doubt, will be thronged with immense crowds of.peoPle from one end to the other. Terporary platforms for their reception have been erected at many plaoes, .and.the chargs for these, as well as for every other species of public accommodation, have been confidently fixed at such a scale as is suro to be remunerative.

CoBDEN.-The result of the general election in England affords a remarkable illustration of the dangers of supposiDng that either great talents or great services will for ever cover blundering obstinacy with tho shield of impunity. We took occasion to remark two or three weeks ago upon the lamentable lack of judgment which Mr. Cobden and his Free Trade colleages have disFlayed in dealiu with nearly every gmeat question in tho osn England snce the triumph of the League. Hfe displayed, in the discussion of a prely commercial matter, a sagacty, energy, and elear-heednees which, drew down on him the applause of the whole cvilized world, aud whichenablebd himto ^make head against the most formIdal combmnation with which any politician has ever had to contend. He came out of the Free Trade atation, while atill in his prime, and found himaelf among the foremost men of his age, with wits sharpened by 10 ears of vigorous oontroversy, and with an ambition which might justly have aspired to anything which the State could bestow. Had we been asked in 1S4T who of aU the public men of 1ngland held the most enviable positlon we should undoubtedly have fixed upon Cobden as that one whose lot was most desirable and whoe future was most brilliant, as on that famous night he heard Peel repudiate in his favour all claims to the victory just won by Free Trade over Protection. Twentymillions of peoplo in that eventful year blessed, as they Bat down to each meal, the dauntess tribune whose fortitudo aud eloquence had cheapened their daily food iu a seson of unexampled severity and suffering. All England was at his baok. He entered the House of Commons witLa pyestige to which no aspirant for Parliamentary honours within tbis century could lay claim, and-what is still rarer-his success in the House justified all that had been, said of him out of doors. Ulnfortunately, he fell into. the snare by which viser and better men than himself hav. been ruined before non. Foreign politics exercised on himtbe facinaon which they exercise more or less on every man wrho dabbles ever so little in public afais.

In the north of Ireland wages of labourers at present are at the rate of from Is. 6d. to is. 8d.per diem, and for a pair of horses 9g. a-day. In the south a man with a pair of horse and plough receives 1ls. a-day; labourers 2s. 6d.; and women from Is. to Is. 3d. per diem. QUEE&'S UNIVERstIy n fELAlD George Johnston Stoney, A.M., and Professor of Natural Philosophy at Queen'a College, GILway, was on Friday last elected Secretary to the Queen's University,in room of the late Robert Ball, LL.D. No less than 57 candidates sent in their credentials, but the list was subsequently reduced to 18, and the election was by bllot. MIr. Stoney was a Madden prizeman in Tinity College, and had he presented himself a second time there is no doubt he would have won the fellowship. PAUPEx EQGnATION. The Earl of Stradbroke, who is an extensive landed proprietor in the south of Ireland, has addressed the following letter to the Clonmel board of Poor Law guardians approving a scheme of pauper emigration projected by that body .- "Henham; near Weagford, Suffolk, April21,1857. "Sir,-I regret that my abaence from Mreland at this season makes it imposible for mo to take part in the discuEsions on the propriety of persuading paupers in the Clonmel Union to emigrate to one of our colonies.

iORBBIGN INTELLIGEYOW. RANCE. rsom OUB OWN cOBEPONDl2QT.) --of-d u A. portlon of the followig appe3rod In our seoondl -dtlonG vn br v-I PARIS, SUNDAY, WAY 3, 6 p.mr. The Jeumal des Diba4s of to-day contains an Article on the English elections, in which " the interesting spectacle of, a free people who transact their affairs amid the greatest political excitement, ithout any one in the three kingdoms or on the continent apprehending the slightest injury to social order, or interruption to the regular march of goz~ernunent," is held up to general admira~tion. as France is on the eve of her own elections, when mnatters will be conducted after a different fashion, and when al free expression of opinion be ca fully suppressed, the article is, perhaps, meaat nob only as an eulogy of English institutions, but as an Indirect satire on those of France; and as showing that while in the one country the Parliament is the isswe of the people's will, in the other the coming 3Leglslatve Chamber will be, like the one that is about to expire, the mere result of the will of the Government. A spirit of opposition has, neverthefess, manifeEted itself in several departments, and *the electors of certain localities have begun to murmur at the sort of canaidates sought to be imposed upon them. Symptoms now and then appear of - patience at not being allowed to speak or wrlte with mnore liberty than they have enjoyed for a long time. Their amoturprre is hurt at seeing some orderly officer or aide-de-camp Eent down to them, with no oRtlon but to take him for better or worse-someone with whose opinions or person the electors have had no acquaintance whatever, and whose name they haps only now hear for the firat time. They 1gi to tbink, very naturally, that as order and tranquillity are now, as the Government itself boasts, generaUy and solidly established, no danger can reWult from the relaxation of excessive restraint and a more extensive toleration to the citizens in the exercise of their electoral rights. The basis of the great and durable structure has long been laid; the edifice, we are told, is every day acquiring more strength; but the people feel that the iberty which the Emperor long ago promised should crown the summit is still to be waited for.5That diseontentprevaiis in many places the reports of the Prefects are said to afford sufficient evidence, and, however these gentlemen are in general disposed to report notbing but what is agreeable to those on whose will their future advancement depends, there occur certain facts which the most subservient among them cannot suppress. This dissatisfaction has given some uneasiness to the Government, and, though there is no doubt that the vast majority of the new Deputies will be Ministerialists, yet itis a significantfactthat, inorder to produce that result, greater efforts will have to be made by the functionaries of Government than heretofore. It is said that agents have been sent to the more suspected departments, independent, and perhaps, in some cases, without the knowledge, of the Prefects, to report on their opinions, and to ascertain the chances of the Ministerial candidates. With the machinery the Government bas at its disposal a majority must be obtained, bat It is apprehended that many of the electors will abstain altogether from voting, either out of opposition or from utter indifference to the exerci3e of their right. Such marked indifference would be considered not as equivalent to defeat, but certainly as a severe censure on the Government, and to prevent this the efforts of its agents are directed. What the Republican party intend doing I know not, and perhaps they are themselves still undecided. Their plan was to bring forward their more popular candidates; if successful, that these should present themselves to the Legislative Body, and should publicly refuse to take the oath of allegiance to the Imperial Government when tendered to them. This, it was suggested, should be repeated on every occasion when a vacancy occurred. Some had great hopes of the moral effect of such a proceeding, and they pointed to the perseverance of the electors of London in aming for so many years Baron Rothschild as their representative in Parliament, and to the certainty of that perseverance being at no distant date crowned with success by the complete removal of Jewish disabilities The experiment required great patienee and determination; it involved also the loss of much time, but it was an experiment worth trying. On the other hand, it was alleged thatFreneh electors do not possess the qualities which could alone Pnsure success. They do not care to be disturbed from their ordinary avocations to exercise the rights of citizenship, even when its exercise is for a wond fide object, but much less do they care when the success is only apparent or momentary, and they cannot comprehend the value of an election which involves a mere abstract principle without positive resuts. In some few districts the Government will not venture to combat the candidates, from a3rwell- unded apprehenion that their own men would defeated; and they will affect to accept or approve them because they cannot do otherwise. They were seriously uneasy for a time lest M. Thiers should accept the offers made him at Rouen, as, In ronsequence of his opinions on free trade so completely coinciding with the manufacturers of that place, there was a moral certainty of his success. The Prefect was instructed to inform the chief manufacturers, which he did, on the first favourable occasion, that the Government would oppose no one there except a Freetrader. They were greatly trantquillized when M. Thiers announced his refusal of the honour intended to be conferred on him. In some districts I am informed that Orleanlst candidates would have a good chance of being elected-not so much, perhaps, out of very great love for tbat caulse, but in order to mark the indignation of the electors at having individuals thrast upon them whose names they never heard, and Wahose only claim consists inbeingconnected with the Court. The most strenuous efforts are expected to be made against M. deMontalembert in the department of the Doubs, where it was resolved to put up the Duke de Conegliano, the Emperor's Chamberlain. M. de Montalembert wil not give up the College that has elected him, it is said, except ia the event of that person opposing him, but in that case he will come forward against the second representative, M. Latour Doumoulin. A person of much influence in BesanQon, who hadbeen for 15 yearsPresident of the CounciX-General, but-was some time since removed from that post to make way for some one less) independent, has gone over to the other side, and taken a good number with him. On the whole, the Government is forced to take mnore precautions than usual to neutralize the menaced opposition, and the new division of arrondissemuents in some, and even the disappearance of a certain number of electors in other places, are said to be among those means. M. Alfred de Musset, one of the youngest and raost distin ed members of the French Academy, died yesterday, after a short illness The Grand Duke Constantine dined yesterday with the Russian Ambassador. Several Generals, Marshals, and personsXbelonging to the Court, were present. The Russian Ambassador proposed the health of the Emperor Napoleon, Marshal Vaillant that of the Emperor Alexander, Manshal Pelisrier that of the Russian army, and the Grand Duke that of the French army. The Grand Duke congratulated himself, in the name of Russia, on being able henceforth to count as Iis friends the intrepid conquerors of Alma and Sebas topol. After dinner the party went .to the house of the Minister of Marine to attend a bal. The Grand Duke entered with the Princess athilde, whose husband, M.

Ai letter from Toulon says that on the 29th ult. Zaq Ruinl *quadron in that port fired a Royal malute in honour of the-birthday-of the -Emperor Ale4xander II. The harbour at that moment presented a magnificLent spectacle. The Bretagne, the flagship of Admiral Trehouart, responded to the salute, and shortly afterwards all the ships of the two nations were decked out in their gayest colours. The seamen of the Russian squadron received permission to spend the day on shore. They visited every part of the town, and constantly observed the most perfect discipline. A letter from Rome of the 23d ult. announces that the journey of the Pope into the various provinces of the Roman States is confirmed. Hiis Holiness is determined to proceed as far as Bologna. This journey, it is said, will cost more than 300,000 Roman crowns (40,0001.).- In the meantime coins of the value of 20 sous are being struck at the Mint for distribution among the poor. Cardinal Antonelli, it Is said, is opposed to the journey, but the Pope is determined on it. The Cardinal lias, according to the writer of the letter, addressed circulars to the governor of the provinces through which the Pope is to pass commanding them to organize manifestations which may convince his Hroliness that everyting is goinlg on well in his Siates. AUSTRIA. (FROM oUR OWN COUREPONDNT.) VIENNA, JAY L A few days since it was stated that the Porte was beginning to display some irreolution In the matter. of the Danubian Principalities, but the Turlish Government will never voluntaily consent to the political union of Moldavia and Walachia. " The Sultan," says my informant, " is extremely desirous to prove his-gratitudetothe Emperorof theFrench and he will agree to any reasonable demands th4 may be made on him by the French Government, but he cannot ponsibly consent to a measure which would be quite as pernicious to the Turkish empire as was the treaty of Adrianople." Up to the year 1848 only certain privileged Yowish families were allowed to, reside in Vienna, but now any Hebrew who- has -the means of providing for himself and family, is permitted to establish himself here. It appears, however, that the authorities in some of the provinces are less tolerant than -those in the capital, for we learn from Saaz, in Bohemia, that the burgomaster has ordered all the Jewish families residing in the town-there are some 60-to quit it within a fortnight. The political rights of the Hebrews in Austria have not yet been definedA but It is hardly probable that Government will permit the Jews domiciled at Saas to ba driven into the streets by this Bohemian Pasha. In spite of wind and weather, the preparalions for the reception of their Majesties continue Ih Hungary. During the night of the 28th April there was a violent thunderstorm at Pesth,with heavy rain, but the weather improved so much yes. terday that the workmen were able to repair the damage which had been done to the triumphal arches, obelisks, &c. The inhabitants of Debreezin intend to. present to the two little Archduchese Sophia and Gisella a headdrem which is peculiar to the district. The "Parta," as It is called, Is commonly a broad hoop of ilver gilt, but those to be given to the Imperial children will be made of gold, with three rows of precious stones (rubies, emeralds, and dianonds) on the lower part of the hoop, and some arabesque work in diamonds on its upper rim. It may be observed that red, green, and white are the Hungarian national colours. During the last few days the "Minister-Conference " has had several sittings, at which-as is stated-Hungariau matters were discussed. Positive infornation has been given me that a general amnesty will be granted, and the political proceedings now pendmg quashed; but no greater concension will be made to Hungarian than has been made to Italian nationality. Within the last 24 hours Hunoarians who deeply regret the loss of their privieges have candidly confessed to me that the confusion which prevails in Hu would be ten times as great if Government should attempt to retrace its steps. "The die i7 cast, and the principle of unity must be rigidly maintained, for, If not, the whole machine will fall topie*" My own opinion is expressed in the foregoing sentence, but the Government wzill assuredly do well to yield on the school and language questions, which the Hungarians have much at heart. The establishment of the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian as Governor-General of the Lombardo. Venetian kingdom is on a very grand scale. The palace is magnificently furnished, the ante-rooms are crowded with servants in splendid liveries, the stables are flled with fine horses, and a State carriage like that used by Her Majesty Queen Victoria is being built bv Sala, the most renowned of the Milan coachinakers. The Archduke has several Seressaners in his service, and some time will probably elapse before the Belgian Prince will be able to accustom herself to the sight of men who carry about with them a complete armoury of knives, pistols, and cutlasse. The Archduke has visited the principal public institutions at Milan, and among others the hospital, where he remained two hours. Baron Suin, the only son of the late banker, who left property to the value of between 70,000,000f. and 80,000,OOO1, has ordered an Hungarian dress which equals, if it does not surpass, that worn by Prince Esterhazy on State occasions. The chain which fastens the dolmeann (short pElse), the buttons of the attUa (jacket), the swordsel, scabbard of the sword, and spurs, are of massive gold, studded with emeralds and diamonds. A Hungarian paper says that the emeralds weigh 1,o00 carats, but it must be far below the mark, for one of the stones, which is faultless, is of the same shape and size as a pigeon's egg, and many of the others are as large as shillings. The artist who made the ornaments is M . Biedermann, the Court jeweller, a person who is well known to many of those high and mighty European ladies who take delight in tiaras, diadems, and such-like gauds. As a reward for his courage in braving the auger of the old Conservatives in Hungary, ML von Conrad, the burgomaster of Pesth, is to be made an Aulic Councillor and Vice-President of the Court of Appeal when the journey of their Majesties in Hungary is at an end. M. von Hacklinder, who appears desirous to obtain some fixed occupation m Austria, will give a detailed account of the Imperial progresses. M. von Hacldander is the gentleman who a few days since received the third class of the Iron Crown. The principal maritime Powers have promised that even in case of a war the Novara shall be considered a neutral vessel and treated as such. There was a alight improvement on 'Change today. PRUSSIA. Crn oa OUR OWN aOOMzONlDM.) BERLT, MEY 2. I mentioned to you recently that some portions of the poisoned bread which had nearly produced so much mischief at Hongkong had been forwarded to Baron Liebig at Munich, for analy". The simple forwarded to him consists of two oblong loaves that have been baked in a mould, probably a tin form. They have been enclosed in a tincase, hermetically soldered, but, owing to the bread having been put up in a moist stats, thes loaves were covered with a thick mould by the time they arrived. The alysia made by aron Liebig leave, no doubt that arsenic was the poisonous ingredient used on that occasion, and, moreover, every portion of the bread, crust and crumb, contains that poison so thoroughly and so equably distributed, thatmost undoubtely it must have been kneaded into the dough, if it were not even originally mixed with the flour. According to one analYsis 50 grammes of bread contained 260 mill- grammes of arsenic, whioh, in lb. of 5oO grammes, would give from 88 to 39 grains of our apothecaries' weight; according to another the llb. of bread yielded 2.8 grammes, or 42 grains of arsenio. The quantity here found is evidently quite enough for all lethal purpose., supposing the whole quantity of arenic thus introduoed into the 6toma became at once active; by its intimate mix. ture with the bread, howevet, It was brought into oontaqt with the coats of the stomach or introduced into the secretions only gradually, according as the bread itself was digested: the vomiting, caused by 4he first grsdual exhibition of the arsenic in very minute quantities, was the means of preventing the remaining larger quantities, already received into the stomach, from producing the result intended by the perpetrator of this wholesale crime. The saiple of bread- are understood to have been forwarded to Munich by some of the persona whose lives were thus endangered, and who were not sat&flea with the reults obtained in the examination of LT t Wednesday, the birthday of tho psent -bpnror of Russis, the King's nephew, was celebratod at Charlottenburg, as is usual here. The Russian Minister and the entire personnel of the Russian Embassy were, according to custom, invited to the Royal table, at which the two Princes of Leuchtenberg, sons of the Grand Dachess MIarie, who have within the last few days arrived here on a visit, were also present. Yesterday the Prince of Prussia arrived here, for the purpose of attending the spring inspection of the Guards. The various Princes and Princesses of the Royal family now present in Berlin dined withtheKingandQaeen at the Schloss here, and this morning the Prince left for Potsdam, to commence with the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards. Last Saturday evening Prince Alfred arrived at LeipEic, on his way from Switzerland to Gotha, and after devoting a few hours to the inspection of the observatory, museum, and other sights of the tovrn, proceeded onwards the next day to his destination, where he arrived on Sunday evening. The Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, accompanied by our Charg6 d'Affairea, Mr. Barnard, went torecelve him at the railway station. After spending about a week there, Prince Alfred was to proceed to Coburg for a longer stay. A week or two back, on the authority of the Rhenish papers, I' Informed you that' a house had been [taken at Bonn for the Prince of Wales, who would soon arrive there to paws afew terms at that university, as his father had done before him; and it was also added that Prince Alfred was aubseq-uently to joia him there. Since I have had ocedon to remark irith' what pertinacity the Swims papers peraist in callingPrince Alfred " Prince of Wales," the first statement about the Prince that is to study at Bonn has become very apocryphal in my eyes, and the more I have inm iredinto the truth of it,. the more convinced I am how very much it standsai in need of confirmation, if it is to be received as true. The committee that was formed about a year ego in Halle for erecting a statue to Efandel in that, hint native town, on occasion of the approaching centennil anniversary of his death, has aleady made such satisfactory progress in the al-important work of collecting subscriptions to that end, that it has em- powvered the sculptor, Hieidel, of this town, to pro- - ceed with the elaboration of his colossal model of the great ma.ater. A smaller study for the larger work, which has been finished, about-two to three feet high has already met with the greatest approbation ~ from all those interested in the work, and more par.' tioularly from the King of Prssia and the Du4ke of Saxe-Coburg, tio of the best judges of art in Gar-, many. As I believe thbre is a branch committee: in London for advancing the same object, it may be, satisfactory to some of your readers to kuqw that' the general affair is maaking progress.
EGYPT. (F1oM OUR OWN COnPAOND' ALEXANDRIA, A 25. The anxiety felt regarding the fate of the miuing steamship from Australia has been happilyrelievedbythoarrivslat Suez on the 19th ins. of the European with the intelligence that the Oneida had returned in safety to King George's Sound. It appears that shebroke her sole-plate and orankpin wheni abont 400 miles north of Cape Lewin, and she was oblig to put back to the Sound, where she arrived 36 hours after the departure of the Simia on the 22a of February. Having receivecL some temporary repairs she sailed for Sydney on the 22d of iArch. The .Etna, from Southampton, arrived here this morning, and leaves Alex. - andria this afternoon on her return voyage to England, carrying with her the nais and passengers by the European, the latter numbering in all 144, and including tho passengers by the Oneida. The prospectus of the Red Soa Steam Navigaiion Company El Medjidieh, estblished by the Viceroy under the Auspices of the Sultan, has finally been published. The object of this undertaking is the establishment of a line of stemers trading from Sez to tho several ports of the Eod Sea, with corresponding lines in the Mediterranean from Alexandria to Tukey; but it is stated that the sphero of its operations will subsequently be xtended to the Persan Gulf. The capital of the company is limited to o00,)000., in 40,000 sharem of 201. each, audits affirs areto bea dminis. :ered by a Board composed of 12 members, at present under the presidency of Mustafa Bey, nephew of the Vice. roy. The directors, appointed in the first instance for the Donduct of preliminay arrangements, and for the general organization of the company, are to hold offcoe for 15 yer, but they will subsequently be elected for only three yeirs and none but the holders of at least 50 shares are eligible for a directorship. Ten per cent. of the profits will be set apart to be divided among the managers am a remuneration for their services, and it is further stated that in the event of an insUffiieanoy of profits an indemnity will be awarded to them, the msinimum of which is fixed at 5600 per annum. The steamers are to sail under Turkish colours, end it is tipulated in the Sultan's firman that no difficulty or differenoes that may arise with the Government shall, under any dlrut-anceo, bo brought before the Consular Courts, but that aU the affairs of the company are in every rspet to be nder the sole jurlsaiction of tho Egyptian or Turkiah authorities. It is said that 300,000M have already been subscribed, and, aS according to its published statutes, tho company is declared to be constituted on one-fourth of the maxzimum capital being provided, We may shortly expect to see som e definite arrangements entered into for carrying the proiect into execution. A. steamtug has lately been introduced into the harbour by an English mercantile house here, and it commenced operations some days ago by towing out the yacht Sylphide, the owner of which has passed the winter in Egypt. It is also proposed to make use of this little steamer for the purpose of towing round boats with produce from Rosetta and Damietta, but there appears to have been some hesitatioa on the part of the local authorities in permiting the boat to enter the mouth of the river. The Egyptian Governmen has asserted a claim to sole and absolute control over the navigation of the Nile, and in virtue of this prindple the Nile Steam Tug Company was lately formed under the patronage of the Government, and with the exclusive privilege of towing produce-boats to and from Alexandria. As a necessary consequence, it becomes incumbent strictly to exclude foreign vessels from the Nile, for If they be admitted, it is not easy to see by what means steamers can be pre. vented from taking boats in tow. In the present instance an attempt may be made to avoid further dispute regarding the right of foreigners to Own' vossels on the Nile by admit. ting the stzmer as far as Damietta, looking upon the town asa seaport; but where is the boundary llne to be drawn, and upon what principle is an exception to be made against Other places at a greater or less distanoe Up the river? The steamtug has obtained her clearance for Damiettm.I but the point has not been distinctly conceded, and the e appears to be some apprehension that she may be stopped at the mouth of the river. Tho streets of Alexandria have for some days past been fllled with Turldsh soldiers, a body of about 3,000 men having arrived from Constantinople on their wayto the Hedj ,z. These men have not on the present occasion jutified the character for subordination and orderly conduct usally ascri'bed to tho Turkish gular army, their presence here having been attended with a daily succession of brawls and disturbances. The American Consul-General, in endeavour. ing to rescue a couple of Greeks, whom a body of armed soldiers were dragging past his house, had a narrow escape from some rough handling in consequence of his good. ntured interference; but his representations to the authcrities have had the good effect of awakening the attention of the locl police to the necessity of more viglant meaures for the maintenance of order. Lieutenant-General Ashburnham left Suez on the 21st inst. by the Peninmslar and Oxiental Company's steamer Ava, on his way to China. H3er Majest's ship Tartarus left Alexandria on the 23d, steering eastward towards Aboukir Bay. Little or no business has been transacted in our gra'nt markets for some time past, owing to the almost tot I absence of stocks. Contracts for Salde wheat, for delive y in September, are changing hands on terms equivalent, at the present moment, to about 338. per quarter free on board. The cotton-market is rather quiet, the better descriptions of the staple being very scarce and diffioult to obtin.

PBPESIrA 4AD-) THE PBrA& S. - - Ysterdy afternoon LieutenanttColonel Sir H. Rawlin. son, .C.B., delivered to a numerous and fashionable audience, assembled ia the lect0 theatro of the United Service Institution, Whitehall.yard, a lecture on Persia and the Persians. Having promised that it would be impossiblo for him in a single lecture to give his hearers anything like a complete account of the geography of Persia, or of the character, manners, and customs of its inhabitants. Sir H. BA-w1IrsoN said, that ho shotld on the present occaion confino himself to a brief notice of the geographical divisions of the country and its more prozi. nent physical features. He would then describe the principal characteristics of tho inhabitats, especially of that class from which principally the army was raised. Ee would touch upon the army itself, its consttution and organization, and would conclude with some remarks bearing upon the war which we had lately been carrying on with Persi, and upon any other, war in which. that country might In fature be engagedL In these remarks he should stwer cleer of ali politcal questions, and should consider the late war smply as a military question. Persia geographically considered Was acount- pa-s. It was an smmeae pletcau or table. land shut in ctween ranges of mountains on the north and the south-west the former being a continuation of the Cacasus atd the latter of the Tawrus. This cau saloped gradually towards tho eas, and it psinpa chaacteristio wasthat it was intersected by ranges of mountins, pars of the two gvear ranges which he had mentioned, having narrow vail between them. IUnder these circumstnes the genera oncter of the country was necesarily one of extreme sterility. The climate ws subject to variations from extreme cold to extreme heat. In the north the cold was peter than in England, while on the coast of the Peran Gulf the heat was more intense that that of India. Dwirf oaks grew along the mountainu, but with this cxeep. tion, andthat of a strip of land alongthe beanks of the Osspian Sea, the only wood to be found in Persia was gwa in garde=,s which, in the entire absenoe of ned, wers dividecl by mud wall pRose and ighnplea exiW tedonly in the ima nTtionTh prevailing evil of the oountz7 was tho want of wer, a wnt which was to some extent supplied by mea of xabterra. neaA aqueducetwhichwereof great depth and 20 or 30 mils in length. These aeducta had been introduood ffom C dea, they were caed by aChaldean name, and mention of them was found in the earliest Chaldean inscriptions. Near the northern frontier of Persia w a mountain called Ararat; this, though long supposed to be so, was not really te Aiarat of the Bile, aon which the ark redeod, that mountain being, not In Armenia, but to the north of MosuL Under Axat W a district of which the Russians were very anxious to obtain poeasion, not on acoount of its extint (because it was very small), but because througlh it ped all the Buropean trade with Pers.

Theeastern province was well cultivated and wel peopled. The ethnic divison of the esng population of Pers was into Persians and Tarks, the Lote f whom were of the same raweas the Osmanli Turks,' and crosed the Oxus about 1,400 years ago; but thera was £ still moto strongly mrked division of the population Into livers in hows and livers in tents. The latter of these clase deoted Whemslves almod entirely to toral pursuits, and lived upon the produoe of thi ofocks and herds, while the former were ubanidmen, and supportMd themselves and their familes by the cultivation of the soiL The pastoral tribee furniashe the greater portion of the soldiers, and were supeior both in mental ad bodily qualities to the dwllers in hounse They were compaatively honest, were certainly brave, and had many of the character. istics which were to be found among highland tribes in Enro p. At the same time they ware the most aperstitlous pIopl in the world, and universally entertained the most absolute belief in the existnce andpower of genii or djins. Although nonrinillyi Mahometans, they were realy the deseendants of the Manicheans and Gnostics. To illustrate the supertitions of these peopl, and also the general charac'teristics of these pastora=tribes, the gallantlectrer related several anecdoW referring to circumstnoes which had paed under his own. observnon, or with which he had ecome qu ainted whileengaed in the oraLiuation of a regiment of these oords. IHe thbn pased on to notice the Persian army, which, he said, consised of four divisions,_ regula, rre s, tilery, and' cavalry. The regulars were the most important troops They were generaUy drawn one from each famly and he (th lectuer) had, in more than one instance, wnon a man, in order to obtain a young woman au a bride, sero as a sub- stitate for her brother,-thmu of}r a perfect I illustration of the Biblical csom of servg fora wife. Sometimes the troops served for only even years, but they generall continued soldiers for life. The mit servie washeld in but littleesteem, beoau the menw werolbut ill taken care of, their pay was smal and sall as it was they often never received it; that wathey were frequently fives or six years in amrar. Commisrit ther was none, and he had on some ocaslone seem the Eoldiers compelld to eat ips, grass, dry corn, or acorns. Nowthedz. this the enduranco of the men was wondefuL Abbe Lrza per formed asnarchof about 2M500mileeattherataof21 miles rday, and on one ocasion when he (Colonel Rwaluso dismised a regiment the men walked to their homes, 150' miles off, in three days. The Perslans certainly had reate power of endurance than any other troops in theworid, a oould, he believed, travel at the rate of 50 or 60 miles a-da:. as long as you pleased, The army as now constitute owed its existence entirely to the exertions of the Bdtish Gove=nment, which, about '50 or 60 years ago, feeling the importance of making Peisia a defence for India, supplled the troops with arms and sent out British officers to train them. *ohe nu.mber of regulars was now about 60,000, but' these were distributed all over the country, aui he doubted whether more thin 20,OODor 30,OO could be brought toge. theratonsoot. Thesea.lthoughgoodmen,wereaobadlyoommanded, baFy fed, and badlyclothed, thattheywould bo for. midable to no Eu-opesa army; lemt of all to a British army. The itregularx wee armed ohiefly with thows famous gans of which weheard so much in the AJghan wars, and with swords, made chiefly in Khorasan, which had a marvellous temper and for which they sometimes gave as much as 1001. 'iTheir most efficient arm, however was artillery, and for the organization of this they were ndebtedto nglish offioers. Their cavalry was also very effectie and theirs was the only army in which you could sec 3000 or 4,000 reen in chain armour. The Eoords generally wore such armour, and found it of great advantage when they were' not opposed to tros who used fire . About 50 years ago Persia could have brought 100,0O0 or 150,000 horsemen into the field, but owing to the measures which had been taken to diminish the power of the chiefs, who used to breed horses for their followers, she could not now muster more than 20,000 or 30,000.' Having thus noticed the geography, the people, and the army of Pereia, Colonel Rawlinson then proceeded, in conclusimn, to consder the strength of Persia with regard to the late or any other war. we were, he said, accustomed to underrate the difficulties of a war with Persia, and to suppose that because in 1827 Paskiewitech with 10,000 men overran the north o' that country, took and garrisoned four of the princicitlei, and thretened the capital, we could do the same thing. In that cae, however, Paskiewitsch had his own frontier as his bae. He had only to cross the Ares, and he found himself in a part of the country richly supplied and comparatively open, and in which the greater part of the inhabitants were in his favour. Had he found it necesary to advancenfurther into the country he (Colonel Rawlinsonj believed that his great campaign would have been a failure. The only expedition with which we could conpare an mivasion of Persia was the expeditioa into Affghanistan,thedifficultiesofwhich'would,he believed, be Infinitely surpassed by those with which we should have to contend in Persia. In.Affghanistan wehad the advantage of illimitable means of transport, having obtained 70,000 camels from the North-West Provinces and Sdinde; we had at Ferozepore a tolerably favourable base for our operations; we had m the invaded country two or three rival classes of inhabitants, from some of whom we obtained assistnce; and the passes were not nearly so formidable as those of Persia. The lihyber, and the other great Affghan pass, were merel* defiles, cutting the mountain chains at right angles in such a manner that if you had possession of the heights on sitheF side the passage of your column was perfectly secure. The Persian passes were quite different. There were no ravines running between mountaini, but, instead, youL had to amcend sheer precipitonaranges sometimes bya zigzag, sometimes along an exposed slope or shoulder, with no ponsibility ofrotecbng the column which must fight its y byyard-andft y foot. At Bahire we could obtain no camels. We could not take thes; useful hut unwieldy anmls by se, and must therefore be content with mule. which would necessitat the carriage of verr large supplies of forage. If we went to Mohamnmerab, which had perhap3 before this been captured by our boops, we could cainly get haels becase they could be obtained iu endless numberAs in Turkish Arbia and brought down to thAat port. Suppose we obtained them, w* might go on as far ^as Shuster, hub beyond that tow^n w coufd noe proceed. It as impossible to cross the moun tains with artillery or regular troops, and the way round them was too long. The only ide from which Persia could be invaded wnth a chance of suocess was from the Turkish domininis, by the road from Bagdad; 'ent, an Turkey wan a neutral, we could not ume her territory a a abe. The passes he did not tbink we ould foroe with an army of les than 30,000 or 40,000 men, and, an there were no divisions among the'inhabitant of Persia likethose which existed' among the population of Ah an, owe should receive no supplies firom them, and it would be impsible toesupport so largea*foroe byzmean30Ulonginge eitiona only. From all this it wrould be seen that war with Persia would be att-nded with great difficule Persia could never be a rich producng or manufacturing country,but he believed that, it would one day be turned to great account as a nursery for soldiers. As a ma thePersi a se rior to any other Lsiatic, or even to a Ria, and as European power became developed in the Eat the mill. tary resources of Persia must be called into activity As no more formidable engine could be launchdaganstour powarein India than a Perian armJycommauded by Russian officers, so wre could have no more efficint defence for that power than such an amy officered by Engli hmen and acting in our interest It quite clear that it was the interest of the Perins to sde with us beause, if they became the vanguard of a Russian army, they must lose their independenoe, while, for the defence ef our ponso 'inIndia, their independene wa, au importn=lemeut the more independent they were the better bulwrk they; wculdbe for Indi.

sUGGPUOXNS FOB ZOG!SMATORS, By THZ FINANCIAL REPOBM ASSOCIATIO. TO TEI REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPYE. Gentlemen,-In the name and on behalf of a body of loyal subjects and good citizens, banded together for the purpose of enforcing by aU constitutional. means the intro. duction of a sounad system of economy in every department of the public service and the adoption of an equitable mode of direct taxation, in lien of one pregnant with injustice and oppression, we, the council of the Liverpool Financial Reform Association, presume to offer for yozr oonsideration individualy a few remarlks on national affairs, reapecting which you are about to exercse a collective judgment. This course of proceeding on our part may appear unusal and intrusive; bat, yielding to none in the dnoerity of our desire to uphold the true honour and dignity of the Crown, in oonjtmntion with the general welfare of the peoplieo offer no apology for adopting it, since to do so would be insulting to your intelligence and ptriotism, and, at the samo time,.most derogatory to our own motives, the excel lence of which you must all admit, though some of you may perchance be disposed to take offenoe at the mode of their manifestation. * You have been deputed by about one thirtieth part of the popuation to legslalte for the whole of it, and thig under a system whicb, on the one hand, gives no rel free dom of choice to the great majority of the electors, comprimn only about one in seven of male adults; while, on the oter, itpl important maart of commeroe and manu. ftures, such as Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow, the very centr of enterpdse, wealtintelligence and population, on a Parliamentary lvel with Petty and insignificant boroughs, the representation of which is ha abolutely the propertyof individulst-the ulable property as tbeir house and lands, their horses and their ctatt e. The reut of this untust and anomalous system i wdely spread feeling of dientisfaction, even among those whoare nominally representedo; whle in tho mindgsof the masses delrived or politiwsl privilegos there is, and has lou; been, growing np a spirit of discontent which in any penod of extraordinary pressure or excessof evillegislation oay break out into oen irrection and civil war Ths dabger can only be effectali arerted by timely ca cons to the spirit of the age and the juAst dmands of the people. Our constitutionxl tkeory ie that all men are oblige to pay taxes because it ia thir representatives who impose-them; and bound to obey e lws because, in the, same wa, they have hada voice minuaing therm. But how wide is tna difference between the theory and the practioe I How essential it is to the publiE welfare to bridge over the yawning gulf that separates the practioe from the theoryto make ths two haimonize with each other, and thus to render the British constituona living relity, Asreguar P-rpentation. instead of being as atPresnt, littlebetter than a fancifuel abstaton whic adds mockery and insult to linustce I we therefore hold that it Will be among the first and mosi important duties of the body to which yon belong to direct its atitetion to such mesues aslu i remove the anoaices of the existingeletoral system, secure a true and free repreoentation to the people, and render the representatives more responsible to the represated than they are at preset. We would next bring under 7our notice what *e con. alder to be quiten modemn urastionon the rivileges of the Houe of Commons, as now constitute.L t is beyond all question that in former. perlods of our bistory, and in times when, as is now generaly supposed, the Monarch was all but absolute, and the rights o the subjet we but litle understoodi and lesm respected, the House of Commo,s ex-dersda Apotential influence in matters both of peaw and war; that it frequently controlled the Sovereia, in one instan refusing to have anything ta do with a war in which the coumtry had no interes, and abouit which they had not been conuloted; in another displacing nilfitary comm-aners And appointing others n their stead; and also that the dovereign solmetimes voluntarily referred such mtters to the decision of Parliament. The rolls of Parl(ament inthe days of the Henrs, Richards, and Edwards record the facts. Such Wa the ancient constitutional practice, whloh prevailed, more or less, down to the time of the Revolx. tion. But, nowadays, we are gravely told that the waging of war, the oonclusion of pea-, the making of treaties to bind the whole nation and pledge ita resources to the latest posterity, are, one and all, things exclusively within the provinco of the Crowrn, with which Parlisment hU not whatever to do, beyond ratifng what has been arrnged by wsecret diplom ay, finding the means for carrYIDg it into execution, and being thankful for such modicunus of information as the Minister of the Crown may vouchsafe to gve, though always aware that facts most important to be known may be kept in the baciground under the convenient plea that their revoltion would bh detri. mental to the public aeevico. Now, considering that the authority of the Crov7n is merely nominal, that all its supposed power is vested in an oligarchy consisting of cue or other of the two great aristocratic parties of the State, whichever happens to hold the upper hand for the time beingp and that such power is almosi invaiably exercised for olgrchical interests and purposes, we cannot but think that if these pretensions be submitted to by the representa tives of the people our fine oonstitutionial theories are rayEdly resolvng tnemselves into a despotism all the more oos because uveiledunder tho pretence of representative initftions 'and constitutional government. While denouncing thes prektensions as regards the foreign policy of tho country, we equally deprecate the centralizing movement which has been so much n vogue of late years, and which seeks to draw all reat power to the metropoli, aa having precisely the same tendency In 3dation to the management of our domestic affairs, and destructive to ancient privileges of locl selfgovernment. We can only protest agalnst such encroachments; yon have it in your power, coUeotively, not only to check all further progress in these directioN, rapid and ominous as its strids have been of late, but Also to return to a really oonstitutional system of government, which shall mako liixste of 1tate the servants of the Crown and the people, instead of being, an they now are, masers of both. In our opinion, ouenostimportant mefs to this end would be to e*V Ministers bsts in the House of Commons ex offido, with. out the power of voting, because sch power is in many instanoes tantamount to transferring the criminal from the dock to tho jury-box, to paw a verdict of acquittal in his, own case, We come now to one of the constitutionl privileges of theHouse of Commons WLhich has fallen into deuetude, or, what is worse, is kept up inform whilelostin substUano We alludeto its control over the public purse. This is an engine which, if properly unsed, would be all powerfta in compelling good and preventing evil legisation. But your predeessors in the late Parliament, a in nsainy proceding ones, uscd or abused it in a manner which would have been disgraceful to, which would rot have been tolerated in, any. municipal corporation, highway board, or parih vestry even for aday. Atlate hours inthin Houses, often consisting almost exclusively of Ministers and their dependents, they voted way millong upon millions of the pubc money I wnthout inquiuy or the shadow of investigation. You cannot supposo that the struggling masse, from whose hard earnings the taxes are wrung, will always bear patiently with such a system as this. It istruethatyour predecessors apportioned particular sums to particular urposes; it is also true that many Acts of Parliament have been passed in order to insure the safe custody and proper appropration of tha public money, according to the intentions of Parliament; but you have only to turn to the astounding revelations containei in the evidence taken before the "Select Committee on PublicMoneys," which satinthe penultimate session of the lastParRament,to asCertain the real value of these precautions You will there find that all these checks and counter-checks are deliberately set at nought, that officialpersonages intended to be bound by them have the hardihood to denounce them as cumbrous, inconvenient, and impracticable; that the Controller-General of the Exchequer, who Is supposed to see that every issue is rightly made, controls nothiig; that the Paymader-General, whoseduties are distinctly specified, and wrho ought to pay everybody, pays nobody, and dischargs none of those duties; that th Deputy PaymasterGeneral, wno is not so muchas named in any Act of Parliament, and is under no responsibility excepting to his principal, pays everybody; and, in short, that the country is completelv at the mercy not merely of the Lords of the Treasury,rbt aLso of sabordinate departments and funetlonariesq all of whom sem to delpretty much as they please with the public money. There is evidently here a wide field for waste, extrava gance, and misappropriation of public fauds to purposes never contemplated, and also for downright fraud and embezilement. f you wish for a striking sample of what has been done inthe WAY of theft you will do well to refer to the case of Mr. HL B. Swabey, late Reglstrsr of the High Court of Admiralty, which yon will find recorded in the Parliamentary apers NoM 331 and 518 of session 185L The evidenoe of Lord Monteagle before the committee aledy alluded to will show you the futility of eAxisting checks on the isue of public money, more partieularly as regards that gross job, the purchase of hereditary pensions; and the Audlt Return, No, 215, of seson 1856, w,ll enlighten you as to the chances of perfoct impunity at tendaing its niapplcation wrhen Issued From the lattet document you wiJl find that of 638 accounts for audit annually 612 remained unaudited at the date of the return, and tha of these many were three, five, six, seven, eight nine, eleven, and one twelve years in arrear I Kno,w.' - this, you can hardly fail to agre with us that a system o audit which only disoovers errors and deftaloations when tho errors are rremediable, and the culprits beyond theroach of retribution, can bo of very little-value, even if it were perfect In itself; but if you examine again the report of the Comm0ittee 6n Public hioneys you will find thlt the ta-it, 'When oompleted, is absolutely. wortbIees in other respeots, the saditors belng so trammelled that they cannot disohsrge their duties efficiently, and some of the most important publio departments auditing their own accounts I The romedies we- suggest for your consideration are-first, a standing finance committee of the House of Commons, invested with sufficient powers to superintend effectively both the preparation of the estiumates for the publio servioe and their appleation when voted; secondly, the enforoe ment of anonoeot and intelligiblo aystem of publie bookki eping, in lieu of the.proseut jumble of mysteries entitled the "fiUinae a tsf;17 and, thiradly,- tho etablihment of a prompt, effective, and adaspendet ystem of audit such as prevails in France and othier countries.

I -This part-heard appeal from an order of Vice-Chaneellor Stuart, commenood on Saturday and reported in The Tims of this morning, was cSis day resumed. The questions were, first, whether a sum of 8,000 . was 'aisable under a mariiage settlement, or only 6,000. - and, recond, whether Mrs. Vaughan, a married daughter of the settlor, wa, entitled to sbare in t'ie amount to be raised, or was exclud d by reason of a sum of 2,000 . hanng en settled upon her at the time of her marrnage- The Vice-Chancellor decided the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative.

VICEMCHANCELLORS' COURXTS. MAY 4. HAIGH V. HAIGH. (Before VieaCMancdlor Sir I.. T. KLND.RSLEY.) mir. BAGsMAWS and Mr. W. H. G. BAGSHAwEs moved in this case thatacertain deed of submission, dated in Febmary, 1854, might be made a rule of Court, and that au award made in pursuance of it might be set aside, under these oircumstances :-It appeared that Joseph Haigh was possessed of large collieries at Hall Ing, in Honley, and elsewhere in Yorkshire, and up to his death carried on business in partnership with his sons, nnder the firm of "Joseph Eagh and Sons," but such partnership was merely by armnSement between the parties. Joseph Haigh died m uly, 1851, having previously (in June, 1851) been a- party to a deed, whereby, and by his will, certain intreests were created in favour of bis sons, John Haigh, Joseplh Armitage Haigh, George Armitage Haigb, and William Haigh. The testator's sons carried on business for some time after his death, when, disputes arising, the result *as a deed of submission, to which John Haigh, Joseph Armitage Haigh, and George Armitage Haigh were parties, thereby all matters in difference were agreed to be re. gerred to Joseph Brooks, who was empowered from time to time to make several and successive awards. In August, 1866, he made an award, and thereby in detail professed to determine the rights of the parties. To this award Gxeorge Armitage Haigh refused to subiit, and this motion wzas made in consequence, on the ground that the award was in excess of the powers vested an Joseph Brooks by the deed of submission, was wanting in finality, and was bad for unmcertainty. Mtr. BAILY and !Lr. PEERTON, for John Haigh and Joseph Armitage Haigh, opposed the motion, and contended that the award was within the terrns of the reference, was final, and certain. Edr. BAGSHAWvE was heard in reply. The VICE-CHANCELLOR said that this discussion was necessarily of a very complicated nature, and the first question turned upon the construction of the deed of submission. The effect of that instrument was that it being impossible to come to a final determination in the absence of the gather's representatives and other persons, as against aU the world, as appeared on the face of the deed, the parties to it chose to agree in a particular way, and were bound by it. The terms were most comprehensive, embraoing all matters and all the parties to it, and it did not require the consent of any of the others to bring any matter before the .tbitrator by one. The power to make several and succeassive awards was unusual, but usefuL and the limitation of time was a peculiar provision. His Honour then referred to the clauses in detail, and thought that the deed was binding upon the parties. The award was a partial one, and referred to matters actually then in difference, which he (the Vice- Thancellor) thought were so in difference. He had finally decided on all the matters secept two, as to which there was a defect. One was as to the ownership of certain coal and land under which it was situate; but it was uncertain whether he had decided as to the ownership of the land. The other defect was that it being referred to him to decide to whom certain coal be. longed, and also to whom the profib of working it belonged, the arbitrator had only decided the former. His Honour thought that the arbitrator had properly decided on the p4rty to have the interim management pending the differences between the brothers. The award must therefore be declared valid in al respects, except as to the two matters to which he had aUded, as to which there had been a miscarriage. (Before Yiee-Chancellor Sir J. STUART.) BRUlISIT V. DIORTON. This was a biUl for the specific performance of an agreement dated on the 6th of December, 1856, by which the plaintiff agreed on or before the 5th of January then next o assign to the defendant " the two messuages or publichouse called the Cider Cellars, being Nos. 20 and 21, in Muiden-lane, Covent-garden, for the residue of two several terms of 60 years and 21 years, for which the plaintiff held the same under leases, of which terms 38 years and 8 years, or thereabouts, were unexpired, subject to the yearly rents of 1541. and 501. respectively, and to the covenants in such leases contained and free from all encumbrances." The agreement also contained stipulations that the defendant should take thetenant's fixtures, and the stockof ale, porter, wine, and spirits on the premises at a valuation, and that the defendant should accept the assignment before mentioned " without requiring evidence of any title prior to the above-mentioned leases," and that he should "not make any objection thereto, notwithstanding any recital statement, or covenant therein contained, or by reason of the leases being derivative or under leases." It appeared that the plaintiff was not entitled to all the premises comprised in the lease for 60 years, but that he was entitled to a part only thereof, and that such part, together with all the premises comprised in the term for 21 years, had been assigned to him in 1854, for the residue then unexpired of thetwo terms of 60 years and 21 years, except the last seven days of each of such terms, at a rent in the one case of 150!. and in the other of f01. The other part of the premises comprised in the term for 60 years had been demised, in 1836, by the person in whom the title to that term wts then vested, to one Levy, and it was now used as a J ewish synagogne. It also appeared that the defendant attended at the office of the plaintiff's solicitor, in company with his own solicitor's clerk, in order to sign the agreement before-mentioned, and on that occasion an ab6tract of the plaintiff's title tothe premises which formed the subject of the case was handed to the clerk, who looked merely at oneor two pages at the commencement of the abstract, but did not examine the abstract sufficiently to make himself acquainted with the plaintiff's title, and in a few minutes afterwards rEturned the abstract to the plaintiff's solicitor. The plaintiff delivered an abstract of his title to the defendant on the 11th of December last; and, after some correspondence between their respective solicitors on the subject of the defendant's requisitions as to the plaintiff's title, the defendant on the 4th of February declined to complete his purchase. This bill was then filed. Mr. Craig and Mr. Rogers were for the plaintiff; and Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bazalgette for the defendant. The VICE.ChANCELLOR said that the plaintiff asked for the specific performance of an agreement to purohase certain lease old property. The defendant insisted that on the production of the title the plaintiff was shown not to have such a leasehold interest as was described in the agreement. Theqeiuestion turned on the language of the agreement as applied to the plaintiff's title. The plaintiff's contention was that the defendant at the time of signing the agreement' had sufficient inforuation &s to the nature of the interest he was purchasing to bind hini to his contract. There was no asnbiguity in the descriution of the property to be purchased by the defendant. lhe difficulty was as to the nature of the plaintiff's interest which was described in the agreement. 'he original lease, creating the term of 60 years in No. 21, Maiden-lane, reserved a rent thereon of 1541., whereas the lease under which the plaintiff held reserved a rent of 1601. But that was not all. The defendant, on investigating the plaintiff's title, found that the lease creating the term of 60 years comprised other property which was now underlet to one Levy and used as a Jewish synagogue, sad that this property was not cosiiprised in the agreement of the 6th of December last. Thus the defendant by no default of his own would be liable to be evicted from a part of the prenisses comprised in, the agreement in case of a breach by Levy of any of the covenanits contained in the lease creating the term of 60 years. To expose a purchaser to such a risk there ought to he a certainty either frotm the language of the areement or upon the evidence that he was aware when he signed the agreement he was purchasing subject to such a risk. Here there was no such evidence, nor did the agreement on the face of it show that the plaintiffs initerest was exposed to such a risk. There was also nothingin theevidence which would justify theCourb in holding that the production of the abstract on the owcasion of the agreement being signed would fasten the purchaser with notice of the plaintiff's peculiar title. It was a caMs in which it was impossible that the Court could decree specific performance; but, as the defendant had shown a want orf caution and prudence in the matter, and as a good deal had been done by bhni in respect of having a valuation made of the fixtures and stock to be taken by him, the biU would be dismissed without costs and without prejudice to either party's right to any action at law. (Before Yice-Chanedlor Sir W. P. WOOD.) PINNOCK V. BAILEY. The Vice-Chancellor was occupied during the early part of the day with this case, the arguments in which have been heard 1U private, and are nowv concluded. Mr. Bolt, Mr. Willcock. Mr. Daniel, Mr. Cairns, Mr. Greene, Mr. Eallett hlr. Roehe, and hlr. SaImon were the eounsel engaged. THlE ATTORNEYGOEYRAL V. FAA. This ease, which has beeh already before the Court upon an interlocutory application for an injunction, was now in tne naper for hearnng. The information sought to establish he ight of the public to thea pce knovwn as George-yard, bst*een Little Saffron.hiIl andHatton-pall, as a publve footw/ay, and to restrain the defendants from obstructing or ecroaching upon this footway by the Romnna Catholio paheu i3~ I cqagme4f epeotion by them upon archesi over George-yard. Upon the motion for an injanction an order had bon made directing the trial at laW of an issue which raised certain questions as to the right of way. The issue 'Was tried on the 3d of February last before Lord Campbell; at Westminster, and the jury found-1st, that there was a publio footway from Little Saffron-hill, in and along George-yard, into Hatton-wall; 2dly, that such right of 'way did not extend over the whole of George-yard; 3dly, that such right of way extended in a cartain specified direction, and that its breadth was seven feet; 4th, that the defendants had ob-tructed such right of way by the erection of a tunnel leading into George- ard, by placing steps at the end of the tunnel, and, further, by loweriDg the passage from Little Saffronuhill; 5th, that there was no other right of way than from Little Saffron. hill into and along George-yard and into Hatton-wall. Mr. DANIEL and Mr. SPBED, who appeared in support of the information, asked for a declaration in the terms of the prayer and according to the finding of the jury, and the costs of the suit and of the trial at law. Mr. HARDY (with whom was Mr. Rolt), for the defendants, contended that the costs of the issue ouglht to be borne by the relators. The suit had arisen from the claim made by the information to a right for public purposes over the whole space of George-yard, and not merely to a right of way across it, which would not have been opposed by the defendants. The relators had failed in establishing their claim to the whole space, and ought to bear the costs of the proceeding. The ViCE-CHAWYCELLOR said that, although the relators bad no doubt at first asserted a right over the whole yard, yet the main point had always been as to the right of the public to a footway at all. It was this leading and imn portant feature in the case made by the information that bad induced the Attorney-General to adopt it; nor did he finda any distinct offer by the defendants of providing a reasonable and sufflicient accommodation before the commencement of the suit. He should direct the defendants to pay the costs of the suit, except so far as such costs hadbeen increased by the claim in the information to a right over the whole yard. These costs must be paid by the relators.
COURT OF QUEENS BENCH. W AT?q'TV.Rh MAVA ME QUEEN V. T=E GUARDIANS OF THE CITY OF LONflflN TATIW tfn Uanco, before Lord CAMnPBELL a-nd Jwtice WNIGHiTIA.N. ERL-E. eand (R0 rn. Mr. klerjeant BYLES, (with whom was Mr. Hawkins) moved for a rule to show cause vwhy a ccrtiorari ehould not issue to bring up an order made by the guardians of the city of London Union, whereby they had awarded that certain charges should be paid by the various parishes in the union. The guardians had power to make an order for the payment of the current expenses for the coming half-year; but the present order was bad, as being retrospective. It app d that a person nained Manini had been appointed collector and he was directed to pay over the moneys which he received,not to his employers the overseers,but to the treasurer of the union, a gentleman belonging to the firm of Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co. The guardians conducted themselves so negligently in these matters that Manini had been getting in arrear for 14 years, and at length he decamped, havingbecome a defaulter to the extent of 22,0001. at feast. A person n.amed Bal had been appointed clerk, and his duty was to receive the checks for the payment of the tradesmen. The duty of the guardians was at the ordinary meetings to apply to thecierk, and ask him what he had done with the checks; but in consequence of their negli2ence Ball had become a defaulter for 3,0001. or 4,0501. at the least. From the same causes the treasurer was allowed to be in arrear to the extent of 4,0001. to 5,0001. A great number of tradesmen were left unpaid, and thus a loss of from 50,00U1. to 60,0001. had been incurred. The question now was, what was to be done? The present application was made on the part of the parish of St. Stephen's, Coleman. street, which was not at all in arrear, but had regularly paid their quota. The guardians had made an order upon this, as weU as upon the other parishes, to make up the deficiency; but this order, the learned serjeant contended, was bad, as being in the nature of a retrospective rate. It was extremely hard on the old occupiers, who were called upon to pay twice over. Lord CAMPBELL.-There can be no doubt of the hardBhip. Mnr. Serjeant BYLES contended that it was also iega], and could not be supported. The order of the guardians professed to be made under the general rules of the Poor Law Commissioners, which had the form of an Act of Parliament, but it was not authorized by them. Lord CAsPRELL.-YoU have stated quite enough to entitle you to a rule to show cause. Rule nii granted. THE QUEEN V. ROWLANDS. Sir P. TzESIGER said that in this case, in which the Court had granted a rule to show cause why a criminal in- formation should not be filed against the defendant for I attempting to provoke a breach of the peace, he (Sir F Thesiger) understood that no cause was shown, and therem fore prayed that the rule might be made absolute. Lord CAMPBELT-Let the rule be made absolute, THE QUEEN V, TRE GREAT NOBTEERN RAILWAY COM- Mr. BOVILL, Q.C., moved for a rule calling upon the Great Northern Railway Company to show cause why a mandamus should not issue, commanding them to register the applicant as the holder of 871. l!s. capital and stock of the company. It was a rule of the company, made, as they alleged, with the approbation of the proprietors, not to transfer less than 101. of stock, and equal multiples of 101. The rule originated In the convenience which it was sup. posed would arise from it; but the rule had been found so inconvenient in practice that the present application was made in order to try whether the company had the power to make such a rule. Lord CAmPBELL said it was fit that it should be eonsidered whether there should be such power. Rale nisi granted. THE QUEEN V. TEE SEWSBURY AND BEIORD RAIL- WAY COMIPANY. Mr. SBIYrmxS moved for a rule calling upon the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway Company to show cause why a mandamus should not issue, commanding them to procure the enfranchisement of certain copyhold property taken by the company. The company were bound by the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act to do this eitherwithin three months after the enrolment of the conveyance, or within one month after entering and using the land. There had been no direct refusal, but there had been several aplica tion,s tmade to the company, which they had hitherto neglected. Lord CAMPBELL.-YOU may take a rule to show cause. Rule nisi granted. RE -, ANT ATTORNEY. Mr. R. KET'rLE moved for a rule to strike an attorney off the roll of this Court on the ground of perjury, committed in an affidavit made by him while acting as attorney for the applicant, an insolvent. A rule had been made on the attorney to show cause why on the payment of his costs he should not deliver up the papers in his hands. The attorney sent in his bill, and in an affidavit which he made to accompany it, dated the 9th of September, 1856, he swore that on account of his bil of costs he had received nothing from the insolvent. This was now declared by the applicant to be false, and he swore that on the 9th of July, 1c86, he paid the attorney 151. on account of his bill of costs, and this was otherwise confirmed. Directions had been given to have an indictment preferred against the attorney, but that could not be done, because it was found that the original affidavit had been lost from the Insolventoffice. An office copy would not suffice, because the commissioner who administered the oath was unable to prove it without seeing his name to the jurat. Lord CAMIPBELL said that if the attorney had been guilty of a misdemeanour when not acting as an attorney the Court would not interfere till an indictment had been preferred; but when it was committed by an attorney acting as such the Court would require him to purge himself. The learned counsel might take a rule. Rule ni3i granted. WHEELTON V. AI.RDISTY. This was an action in which the Norwich Union Reversionary Society sued the Westminster Life Insurance Company upon a policy of insurance for 1,5001., which had been effected upon the life of the late Mr. J. P. H. Jodrell, son of Sir Richard Jodrell. The defendauts pleaded three pleas, in which they alleged that they had been induced to enter into the policy by fraud and covin and by the false representations of the plaintiffs and their agents as to the state of health and habits of the life insured also a fourth plea, in which they alleged that they had been induced to enter the contract by false representations made by the plaintiffs as to the health of the life insured, but without alleging the scienter. To these pleas the plaintiffe pleaded a replication on equitable grounds, that the plaintiffs ad been induced to enter into the contract upon the representations contained in the prospectuses of the Westminster Company that all their policies should be indisputable, except where there was fraud in obtaining them. At the tnal, which took place before Lord Campbell some time since, the jury found that there had been fraud in Brade and Spacknian, the agent and medical referee of the life insured, but not in Riorris and Maule, the agents of the plaintiffs; anddunder his Lordship's direction they found their verdict for the plaintiffs on the first three pleas, for the defendants ou the fourth plea, and for the plaintiffs on the replication to the fourth plea. Cross rules were subsequently granted, to enter the verdict for the plaintiffs on the fourth plea,on the ground that there had been no positive representation made by the plaintiffs,but only a declaration of belief, and also for judament non obs&ante -eredicto, on the ground that the-fourth plea was answered by the replication; and to enter the verdict for the defendants on the first three pleas, on the ground that the plaintiffs were hound by the fraud of the hife insured. The chief point was whether the plaintiffs were bound by the fraud which it was found had been committed by the agent and medical referee of the life insured. Sir F. THESIaSR, Sir F. KELLY, and Mr. MACNAiARA were heard on the part of the plaintiffs. Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. Bovill, Q.C., Mr. Cairns, Q.C. (of the Chancery oar), Mr. Manisty, and Mr. Thrupp, who appeared for the defendants, will be heard to-morrow. (SiUings at .jisi Prius, at Guildhall.) On Thursday last, there being still a cause in the list at Guildhall untried, Mr. Justice Coleridge said he would take it on Monday, and the jury were told to attend. This morning the jury, in obedience to the command of thb judge, were in attendance at Guildhall, and they were then coolly told that the cause had been made a remaneton Friday last, and their aervices were not therefore required.

COURT OF COM3MO PLRAS, WEST flTEZL ?JAV A DENIS V. MORLEY AND COBBETTr; t,Un98 tn Banco.-Ifaster T(erm.) - In tho mg Mn, Vobbett moved for a haoe"a co7pue to ) ring uP the body of her husband, now in the Queen's I risen, inorder that he maight be enabled to move for a rule for a new trial. The action was in ejectment, tried before Mlr. Justice Williams in wbich the verdict was found for the plaintiff. A long affidavit filed by Ms. Cobbett was then read by the Master, setting forth the grounds upon wbich he wished to move for a new trial. The LOrD CHIEF JUSTICE.-Your husband in this afidavit does not show that he is not in a condition to apply to the Court through learned counsel. Mrs. Cobbett-I should. be very happy if any gentleman would do it. There is a gross conspiracy agai nst my bus band. All the counsel Ihave spoken to abou it say, 'You axe nght, but you will never succeed, because all the judges are against you." The LoRD CHEF JusTIcE.-I fear the Court has no power to grant such a habeas. Ms. Cobbett.-Oh, yes. Chief Baron PoDock in a similar case in which my husband was concerned said he could have a habeas; and Mr. Justice Wiliams gave my husband a habeas at chambers. The LORD CBi2r JUTSTICE.-In what court did you ever obtain a habeas? Mrs. Cobbett.- Ob, 50 or 60 habeases, my Lord, in all the three courts. I have nmoved for a habes to bring my hus. band up in all the courts. I was never refused a 7haeas. The Court always held: h ad a right to auply for one. The LoRD CHIEF JUsrrcE.-We unde-istand there was a doubt expressed on the subject by MIr. Baron Parke - but we have sent to inquize. After a short interval, his YCordship said the inquiry had been made, and the Court found that, although at one time a practice had grown up of granetng applications very mucht at Mr. CobbeWts instance, the matter had since been reconsidered, and the Court of Exchequer had come to a resolution that such applications as the present could not be granted, and the Court of Queen's B=nch bad concurred in that rule. The Court felt that this practice was irregular, and they must also be bound by the rule laid down in the other courts, which was only goingbaclk to the old decisions. The learned judge r4erred to the caae of Mr. Hunt, who made a similar application to be brought up on a haeas from Ilchester gaol, to show cause igainst a rule, -which was refused. hlrs. Cobbett.-My husband was imprisoned 12 years wrongflly for a contempt of the Court of Chancery, and I iov or 5habeaas, and he was discharged at last. The LORD C}usF JusTicx-If he is wrongfuly impri. soned no doubt you can move for a habeas. Ms. Cobbett.-He is falsely imprisoned now. The LORD Cnmz JusTicE.-The Court is of opinion that thej.bave no power to grant this application. If you wish to move on other rounds we will hear you. Mrs. Cobbett said she was not then prepared, and retired from the courtm SWET V. SEGAR, This was a County Court appeal from a deisiontof Mr. Pitt Taylor. The actlon was brought to recover 2210. ls by the plaintiff as occupier of premises leased to him by the defendant, which the plaintiff had been compelled to pay for constructing a sewer under the Metropolitan Iocal Improvement Act (18th and 19th Victoria, chap. 120). The defendant held under a ground lease, and sublet to the plaintiff on lease at a rack rent, and in the lease was a covenant that the tenant should pay all Parliamentary and parochial rates and taxes, and all burdens, duties, and impositions wbatsoever. Mr. Milward appeared for the plaintiff- and Mr 'K. Chambers, QC., and Air. J. Brown for the defendant. - For the plaintiff it was contended that the defendant was owner under the meaning eof the statute; that under that Act, on the district commissioners making an order to do certain works, the owner was liable to do them, and if he did not complete them the commissiopiers might do it for him, and recover the costs from the occupier of the preinises, who was entitled to deduct the same from the amount of his rent. The question in this case turned on the words of the covenant in the lease, which the learned counsel oontended were not mc3ant to meet a case like the present, but a case in the nature of a rate imposed on a distrat while this was a specific improvement to the premises. For the defendant it was contended that the obvious mneaning of the covenants was that the landlord should be relieved from any burdens or duty which might be"m pod in respect of the premises by Act of Parliament, and thiz sewer required to be made was such a burden. The CoURT were of opinion that the decision of the learned judge of the County Court was right, and that the appeal must be dismissed. It was very clear that it was the fitention of this covenant that the tenant should bear the charges, impositions, burdens, duties, &c., imposed by act of Parliament in respect of the premises, aud those terms were quite sufficient to include the charge in question.

This was an action brought to recover the sum of 29. 5s. alleged to be due from the defendant for money paid by the plai-ntif at the request of the defendant, who eon tended that the claim ought to be reduced to 41. 5s., inasmuch as he had a set-off for 25& against the plaintiff. The dispute between the parties arose out of horse-racing and betting transactions, and the trial haing lasted about an hour, The learned JUDGE left it to the jury to say whether they believed the plaintiff or the defendant Verdict for the plaintiff-damages, 291. 5s.

COURT OF ZXCBEQUE, MONDAY. M.&Y 4& SPECTAL PAPrF- TL V. IRALTq (Sitting in Banco.) mIs was an action of a rather novel character. The de. claration alleged that the defendant being possessed of a mare which he know to be glandered sent her to be sold at a repository, where the plaintiff, believing her to be Bound, bought her. It then stated that the plaintiff was obliged to expend 61. lOs. In obtaining the opinion of a veterinary surgeon, and further placed the maro in a stable with other norses, one of which valued at 50L, became infected, and died after 10L had been expended in the attempt to cure it. To this declation the defendant demurred, ning for grounds-let, that, as the sale was not accompanied by a warranty, the defendant was not liable* 2dly, that the sale of a glandered horse was not actionable- 3dlv, that the damage complained of resulted from the act of the plaintiff in believing the mare to be sound; and that, as the defen. dant did not do anything to cause that belief, he was not Mr. RAYmonD for the defendant, in support of the demurrer, argued that the declaration was bad, as it did not allege that the repository in question was a public, or the auction a publio one. It might be that this repoaitory was one provided for the express purpose of selling diseased horses; and, as there was nothing absolutely ilegal per se in one' ran selling to another a glandered horse, the ConA would presume in favour of the defendant, and intend nothing in favour of the plaintiff, who was bound to show by distinct allegations on his declaration that he had a good cause of action. The doclaration must proceed upon some supposed criminal act eitber at the common law or some statute. As to the fine, there was nothing to show that circumstances attendant on the sale of the horse amounted to what con. stituted a public nuisance, and as to the statute-law, the plaintiff would perhaps rely on the 16th and 17th of Victoria, chap. 62, which was passed to prevent the Epreading of contagious or infectious disorders among sheep, cattle, and other animal, and provided by the 2d section that any person bringing or attempting to bring for sale any horse or otber animal into any market, fair, or other open or public place where animals are commonly exposed for sale, know. rag such horse or other animal to be infected with glandere, should forfeit 201, The declaration did not show any offence under this statute, as it did not allege the repository to be a public place where animais are commonly exposedfor sale. Bat, assuming this declaration to show apublic offen-o, the in]ury complained of was too remotely connecded with the act of the defendant to render him liable. Here was a case in which the doctrine of carenat emptor ought to apply, but the plaintiff sought to evade it and to reimburse himself for a bad bargain by bringing a novel action. Mr. Serjeant HAYEs, for the plaintiff, submitted that the wilful sale of a glandered horse at a public place, which a repository must be taken to be, did confer a primd facie cause of action on any one who, like the plaintiff, bought that horse there, believing him to be sound,,if injury such as this declaration discevered ensued. Mr. Baron MAnRmn.-It strikes me that you ought to have alleged that the repository was a public place. NVon constat, as Mr. Raymond has argued, but that it wans a place where diseased horses alone were sold. I know that there was a spot in Smithfield-market where such animals were sold' and I know no law which says a glyndered horse may not fe sold for cats' meat, as it is not understood that the flesh of the infected animal is not fit for food, though the disease is highly infectious both to man and beast. You do not show that you were not even told that the animal was glandered. Ib is quite consistent with all that appears on this declaration that the plaintiff bought the horse after having been told by the defendant that it was glandered. Mr. Serjeant HAYES submitted that it would be a forced presumption to infer that state of things, just as it would be for the Court to intend that this repository was not a publi lace, or was a pluce devoted to the sale of glandered horses. he declaration when taken without such unnatural intend. ments, he submitted, disclosed an ilegal act on the authority of decided cases. Reg. v. Henson " (1 Dearsley's Crown Cases) showed that it was a misdemeanour at common law to sell a glandered horse at a fair; and " May v. Burdett ' (reported in 9 Queen's Bench, 101), which went by the name of the "monkey case," decided that an action was sustainable against the owner of a mischievous animal, after notice of its character, for injury done even though its escape was not alleged to have occurred through the negligence of such owner. By adapting the principle and spirit of Lord Denman's judgment to the present case, and altering the phrase somewhat, it was contended that that case showed a clear cause of action here. The dangerous character of a glandered horse was well known; the disease might be communicated both to man and beast; the public sale of such a creature was absolutely prohibited by Act of 'Parliament in certain places. The possessor of such an animal stood in the same position as the possessor of the mischievous monkey, and, without proof of negligence, he was liable for any injury which reuted from his suffering such a creature to go at large. Mr. Baron BR&'WELL.-I think there is great weight in Mr.'Raymond's objection as to the remoteness of the injury here. Mr. Seijeant BAYXS.-If a man sends a glandered horse to a public repository for sale and one of the public in ignorance buys that animal, he would naturally place him in a stable with other horses, and the infection of those horses is inUmately enough connected with the act of the defendant to confer aprirnd facie cause of action. On the whole, it was submitted that the declaration here was good end zrequired an answer, as it &closed the three essential ingredients alluded to by Lord Denman in his judgment in "May v. Burdett"-namely, the mischievous or dangerow propensity or character of the animal; the Jcie on tOe part of the defendant, 'whes duty $ wag dog Wt such an animal a to prevent injury- and, thirdly the .infliction of injUr on the plaintiff- b,y tL animal.

Ther were only three cases in the list to.day, none of which involved any public interest.
ADMIRALTY COiRT MN A v M. - A THE ACTI.-SAL,VArnP (Rgfoore Dr- T.r.ta - LJr. JUSIENGTON delivered judgment in this case. Thts foreign ship, he said was found about 15 miles distant from the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk, and by the assistance of the salvors reached the Humber in safety. Tho Court was of opinion that 1001. was an adequate reward, the action having been entered at 5001. The question was whether, under these circumstances, the Court ought to allow the saivors their costs. The determination of the question mnst be governed by the Merchant Shipping Act. In the case of the "Leda" he expressed his opimon that when the service was performed within three miles of the coast, and t4e sum claimed for salvage did not exceed 2001., the case must be referred to the arbitration of two magistrates. In the present case the service was performed out of the united Idngdom, and the sum chimed was 5001. That the Court was entitled to exercise jurisdiction thereon could not be doubted, but as the Court had found that . 100. only would be a fit compensation, the question was whether the jurisdiction of the Court was left wholly unfettered as to costs. Upon a consideration of the 458th, 460th, and 490th sectibns of the Act, he was of opinion that itL a caue such as this the Admiralty Court was not prohibited froma giving costs according to its ordinary practice. The Court always had been and was most desirous of di8cou ing salvage suits for smal amounts, and would followr the prnciple as far as the awr wrould allow.. Ho fully aitted tnat.there were some diffculties in putting a just construction upon the statute, hut it was not necessary to advert to themn on the preet occasion. Heo pronounced for the costs.

The bark, in ballast, having got on some oc, the steamer, at her request, went to her aid, and, afterlightening her, tugged her off and conducted herto a place of safety. The value of the prowzty salved twas 3,0091. Dr Bayford and Dr. Deane were head for the salvors; Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss for the owners. The COURT awarded 2501.
OOUBT OP BANK.UPTCY, Banagzdurea,&faMy 4. IN BE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANW- (Bcforc Mr. ammiseio:w HoL1RoYD.1 mx. - x 'T.-Xour donour was good enough to say that I might proceed with the examination of Mr. Valiant. One of the directors, but the warnings of my medical advisers, after the labdurs of last week, were such that I felt compelled to abstdn from all work for the last three days. I am not, therefore, in a position to proceed with the exami. nation of Mr. Valiant to-day. It is an examination of rather an unimportant character, as Mr. Valiant was merely a director for a short peried, and, In fact, it would occupy but a very short time. I am not now in a position to ask your Honour to givo me any other day, because Mr. Alderman Kennedy and Mr. M'Ifeod, who are the only two other directors anong the number called upon to prepare the balance-sheet who;m I have not examined, are at present absent. The first is abroad, and the other, although in this country, is prevented, by illineu from attending. With tho exception, as I mentioned the other day, of Mr. Owen, whose examination we shal be able to take when he finds it convenient to come from abroad, I have brought to a close the labours of the assignees, and of course I am happy to be able to say that I have closed my own labours in these examination. Itis true that, although much has been done, yet much remains behind. The assigpees, however, think that it would only be repeating the same story over and over again and be, in fact, a repetition of the exposure of details whicn are su'iciently wearisome, if not revolting; and therefore I do not propose to trouble you further, nor do I propose to in'iot upon the Court the pain of listening to many detils which stil may have to bedisclosed, anu which may hbve to make their appearance upon a future occson in another plac. There appears to be some apprehension in the mind of the public that these examinations have been without object. I may'take this opportunity of stating that not only have they not been without object, but I trust they will not be without beneficial result. I say advisedly, as a lawyer, that I believe there is already quite safficient upon the records of this Court to insure a certain cmviction if a prosecution be instituted. (Hear, bear.) It remains with the Government alone, and I have no reason to suppose that the Government is not quite alive to the great necesity and importance of instituting a prosecution-I say, Sir, it renuams for the Government s'one to determine who shall be the objects selected for the punishment which undoubtedly some of the persons implicated in this inquiry merit. It is not for me to dilate siow upon that question; but I think it is exceedingly important that the public should be aware that it is the opinion of n6re than one of the profession that the disclosures which have taken place in this court show abundantly sfficient ground for nstitating a criminal prosecution, and that the law is adeq,ute for the purpose. I believe that the day is not very far distant when we shall find the Government, having its attention called to the sabject, as it will be by your Honours valuable report upon the result of these procoedings, adoptng measur the effect of which wll be to satisfy the pu ic justice of the country. (Hear, hear.) The CoMssoNE&-After what you have stated, wil it be necessary to examine MIr. Valiant at all Mfr. LITRLEBx.-Possibly not; he is one of those directors whose examination, your Honour sees we are entitled to take and entitled to use elsewhere. If it shall not be found necessary we will not troubleyour Honour any farther with the evidenoe, except that which is of a mere formal character. The Coe nsos.--There is some documentary evidence. Mr. ILATL-Yes, Sir - and also some more formal evidence, with which we need not occupy the public time, and which may be put upon the proceedings. I shall be prepared with that in the course of a week or so, and thereore it i not be necessary to trouble your Hionour with the matter any further.
Gr.ASGoW sPrzNG CIRCuIT cOuRT. GLASGOW. SATuRDAYv MAV 9 -ne L*iasgow spring Circuit Court was opened here on Tuesday, and brought to a close this dav, the presiding Judges being Lords Handyside and Ar&millan. In all there were lfcase; in which 85 persons were accused. Few of the cases presented any features of interest, and the number of returned convicts brought up was fewer than usaaL One of them was sentenced to 21 years' transportation for a renewed act of theft and housebreaking. There were four cases of assault and robbery, in which the culprits were adjudged sentences varying from six years' penal servitude to 14 years' transportation. Charles Little was found gailty of setting 15re to his own house at New Mains, Cam. busnethan, with the intent of defrauding the North British Insurance Company, and was sentenced to 14 years transportation. A rather unusual and somewhat interesting point was raised in the case of Patrick M'Guire, accused of having stolen a box of tea from the window of the shop of Atting Atti, a Chinaman. Mr. M'LAIniEN, the counsel for the prisoner, took exception to the evidence of this man Attingu Atti, on the ground that Great Britain was at war with China, his native country. Lord AnRnmILAs, after having taken time to consider tho point, said,-I have thought it right in this case, as the oblection has been taken, and as it is of a somewhat novel character, to consult with Lord Handyside before giving judgment. I had, however, previously formed an opinion for myself, and I find that his Lordship entirely agrees with me. Whether or not we are at present at war with China is a point on which I do not feel called on to express an opinion; but I am prepared to decide the point on the hypothesis that we are at war, and even upon that hypothesis I have no hesitation in repelling the objection. Fortunately for Scotland, criminal prosecution is conducted by a public functionary. Private feeling and personal animosity neither instigate the proceeding nor influence the result. Hence, there is no necessity for the p uxclsion, but every reason for the admissibility of every actual bond fide witness of ever circumstance connected with every criminal charge. If the only witness in a charge of murder belonged to a nation with which we were at war it would be dangerous to justico if he could not be adduced for the prosecutor, and cruel to the prisoner if he could not be examined in his favour. The principle is that no man's testimony is his own. It belongs in the one case to the public; in the other to the prisoner, and it is necewsary-for the interests of hoth the one and the other that no circumstances of a personal or local nature be permitted to render it unavailable. I have not had an opportunity of consulting tbe authorities; but I think my memory enables me to say that during the war with France French witnesses were examined both in Scotland and in England in criminal c ues. The prisoner was convicted, and sentencod to four years' penal servitude, although eventually the Chinaman was not examined.
EcrCzCAsycAL UmoNf n- SconA.-A series of resolutions has been nublished in some of the Scottish newspapers, signedby 140 of the most influential laymen belonging to the Free Church and the United Presbyterian Church, the two great rivals of the Presbyterian establish. ment in Scotland, setting forth that the earliest opportunity should be used to unite these two seceding communions, inasmuch as both are attached to the same form of church government, and adhere to the same standards of doctrino and.discipline. Both Churches, it is said, equaUy maintain the great principle of "non-intrusion" and spiritual independence; and with respectto the questionof State endowmnent (in regard to which the United Presbyterian Church generally entertains voluntary principles), this point ought to be left as a matter of forrco, more especiaU as any decision on the subject is of no practical consequence in the case of self-supporting commumons. It is fnuther set forth that both Churches are agreed on the necessity of the religious element in education, and on the Divine authority and perpetual obligation to observe the Lord's-day as a day of religious improvement and rest from worldly toils.

LAuTRii5, charged with having stolen 151. in money, two Crimean silver medals, and a greatcoat belonging to Mr. William Harrison, who described himself as an engineer, residing in Addle. hill. It appeared from the statement of the prosecutor, who gave his evidence in a most confu'sed and excited manner, that on Tuesday night lst ho met the prisoner in Whitechapel, when they visited various publichouseis, and eventually passed the night together at a coffeehouse. On the following morning they entered another coffeehouse in Fen. church-street, and, after breakfauting there, the prosecutor left in charge of one of the servants his greatcoat,_ containing, in one of its pockets, If16 and two Crimean medals, and accompanied the prisoner to a publichouse, where they spent a considerableportionof the day.

.fktILJT4BY AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE Yesterday the troops belonging to the Provisional Bae.1 talion at . Chatham who were selected from the Isin depots for that duty were marched to the fortifw ations near Prince Henry's bastion, under the command of -Captain L. N. D. Hrammond, 90th Light Infantry, where they went through a variety of escalading operations witi'. the troops of the Royal Engineers, who are under the command of Colonel H. Sandham, director of the Royal Engineers establishment. The following officers were 'in charge of the escalading party:-Captain W. B'. WILean, St. Helena Regiment; Lieutenant J. W. M-Ad'QU, 70th Regiment; Lieutenant R. B. Deaxe, 74t1'. Higianders; Lieutenant V. G. Coates. 86th Regiment; Ensign W. Thompson, and Ensign R. P. Butler, 78th PHigbl=scders. The whole of the troops belonging to the Indian dests at Chatham are undergoing a course of instruction 'in escalading, in order to be made acquainntc wih those op*rations previously to joining the service ecupanies of their corps in India. It has been-deemea adviesfle that the troops in ganison -t Pembroke shou.sl be encamped this summer at a short dtstance from the -dockyard, and-for this purpose laud has been selected at a placc called Freshwater-east-a spot about,seven miles from IBembroke. The oustomary tenders for th e supply of firewood and straw for bedding are to ba immediately sent in, -so that by June it is lilcely the troops will be under canvas. The place fixed upon is exceedingly open and healty-and w;ojacent to the coast, so that there is every probability- of the health of the troops being properly kept up. Freshwater-east was the spot selected as the site for the new musketry drill, in which the soldiers will doubtless be properly iaitiated. We have accounts from our Malta correspondent to the 29th of April, omlouncing the appearance off that port, on the afternoonof the 23d, of the Boyal Albert screw steam. ship of the line, bearing the flag of Admiral Lord Lyons, accompanied by the Brunswick, the Centaur, and the Conqueror screw steamships of the line, preceded by the Curacoa stesam frigate and the Vigilant screw steam gunboat, whidh two last-mentioned vessels entered Valetta harbour on the same afternoon, leaving the others in the offing, where thoy still continue; but it was reported that they would enter the harbour on the 30th. Our correspondent mentions the following movements at the port:- ""Her Majesty's steam corvette the Desperate arrived on tho 24th from Syra, and the Ariel on the 28th, from the Pirwns. H Her Majesty's screw steam gunboat the Snake left for Elngland on the 23d. "- The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steam-packet Colombo arrived on tho 22d from Alexandria, and left on the 23d for Southampton. - Captain Lyon arrived on the 22d in the Borysthene steamer from the Levant, in which vessel Earl Ducie and Captain Poll left for Marseilles on the same dlay. "$The Vectis, Peninsular and Oriental Company's steami,acket, arrived from Alexandriaon the 23d, andleftfor Marseilles on the same morning. "The Teneriffes screw steamer arrived from Alexandria on the 28th, and left on the 29th for Liverpool. This vessel brooght a confirmation of the arrival at Snez on the 19th rom Australia of the steamner European, with the welcome intelligence-already telegraphed-that, besides her own mails and passengers, she conveyed those of the long overdue Oneida. "The Etna arrived at Malta from Alexandria with these mails and passengers at 1 a.m. on the 29th, and tranferring such as were for the overland route to the Cambria, this latter was ready to start for Marseilles at 4, but had to wait for her bill of health until 5.30 a.m. The Etna proeeeded onwards to Gibraltar and Southampton on the same morning at 10. "The Napoleon m. and the Caledonia, screw steamers, arrived from Leith and Gibraltar on the 27th, to the consignment of the Russian consul, bound for Odessa. "The Killarney screw steamer, from Glasgow, reached Malta on the moraing of the 29th." The Bustard, 2, screw-gunboat, Lieutenant T. B. Collin. Pon commanding, was at the Cape of Good Hope on the 4th of February, on her way from England for China. A letter from her of the above date says:-" We have had a very fine passage to this place,-most beautiful weather, and only tbree days' rain; but we were detained 17 days at Ascension on accoant of the Fury steamsloop, Commander Lockie, having to repair her rudder, and that has thrown us behind; but the Cruizer, 17, Commander Fellowes, and her gunboats are only about 10 days' sail before us, and the Inflexible, 6, sloop, Commander Corbett, and Starling, gunboat, a month. The Plover, 2, steam-gunboat, Lieutenant Stewart, and Opossum, 2, steam-gunboat, Lieutenant C. A. Campbell, are here waiting for the Highflyer,-21, Captain Shadwell, C,B., which is at Natal, landing Government money." The Vict ory, 104, Captain Seymour, C.B., flag of ViceAdmiral Sir George F.

The Adventu re, 4, screw steam-troopship, Commander Lacy. got up her steam in the ateam-basin at Portsmouth ye3terday, to try her machinery preparatory to being reported ready for service. The Winchester, 50, Captain T. Wilson, has been hauled up to the Chatham Dockyard, where the crew are busily engaged in stripping her and removing her stores into the dockyard, previously to the vessel being paid off and placed in ordinary. The Me rsey, 40, the large steam-frigate building at Chatham Dockyard, is progressing rapidly, and already some idea can be formed of her immense size. She will be the longest steam-frigate in the service, being considerably longer than tee Royal Sovereign, 131, recently launehed at Ports. mouth. The follov,ing are the principal dimensions of the Mersey:-Length over all, 336ft. Gin.; length between per. pendiculars, 300ft.; length of keel for tonnage, 264ft. 4in.; extreme breadth, 52ft; breadth for tonnage, 51ft. 3in,. breadth moulded, 50ft. 8in. ; depth of hold, 19ft. 10in.; burden, 3,726 70-94 tons. Her engines will be of 1,000 horEe-power. Two large vessels which have been nearly constructed at Chatham will be launched during the present year; they are the Howe, which was originally designed as a sailing vessel, but has been altered to a 90-gun screw steamer, and the Charybdis, 21, screw steam corvette, which was commenced in March of last year, from the designs of Captain Sir Baldwin Walker, Surveyor of the Navy. The paddlewheel steam-frigate Furious, 16, Captain Sherard Osborne, and the screw steam storeship Hesper, Master-Commander James Hill, sailed from Plymouth yesterday afternoon for China with two despatch boats ani 12 gunboats,- viz., the Surprise, the Cormorant, the Algerine, the Lee, the Banterer, the Lorn, the Kestrel, the Drake, the Janus, the Firm, the Watchful, the Woodcock, the Slaney, and the Leven.

William Gordon, Vice-Admiral of the White and Commander-in-Chief of all ships and vessels in the rivers Thames and Medway. The gallant Admiral expressed himself highly satisfied with the efficient state of the crew. The Cressy left the Bosphorus in company with the Majestic on the 11th of February last. She sighted the Lizard ^n the afternoon of the 24th of April, having previously to that time experienced variable winds and calm weather. She then fell in with strong easterly winds; in consequence of which steam was got up on the afternoon of the 28th of April, and arrived at Spit. head the same night; left Spithead, under steam, on the 30th of April, and arrived at the Great Nore on the 2d of May, at about 7 p.m.; came into harbour yesterday. She brings home large quantities of surplus ammunition, stores, slops, clotbing, &c., for the return of which some time will be occupied beyond the usual time for returning her own stores. On the coastguard cutter Curlew being placed in on the ebb dry yesterday morning, the only bodies found in her were Mr. William Shepherd, late second mate, in command; Edward White, matiner; William Redding, mariner; and Joseph Matthew, first-class boy.

PHILHARMONIC CoNU.BRTS. The rogriamme of the. second concert, which took place last night, was quite as interesting as thgt of the first, a fortnight since. Of the symphonies Mozirt'- was the most welcome; of the overtures, Mendelssohn's, md this without reference to their respective merits-since all four are masterpieces, but because the C minor and The Rduler of the Spirits (the former especially) have been so often played of late years that they would be all the more welcome after an interval of repose. We are not of the opinion of those who admonish the Philharmonic directors to lay aside the symphonies and overtures of the greatest masters for modern productions of inferior calibre, being avware that the society was instituted with a totally opposite view. Nevertheless, the programmes of each year should be constructed with reference to the year previous and the year to come, so that the most renowned compositions may be heard at least once trietnially. They are not so numerous as to make an approximationtosuch aplan unfeasible. Beethoven wrote ninesymphonies, Mozart seven (grand-the others being comparatively unimportant), Mendelssohn three (without counting the Refos-mation, so obstinately held back by the Ieipsic trustees); and among the countless essays of Haydn there are probably not more than six or eight worthyof being carried down to posterityin sch illustrious company. NowthatthePhilharmonicSociety gives only six concerts, it behoves those upon whom devolves the task of selection to exercise a certain discrelion. That the lion's share appertains by right to Beethoven few will deny; but the nine symphonies cannot all be presented annually unless two of them are occasionally included in the same programme, which would be manifestly unfair to his predecessors, Mozart and Haydn, and to Mendelssohn, bis worthiest successor, who in their greatest compositions approach too nearly the giant of the orchestra to be passed over with impunity. The ninth symphony of Beetboven might be produced annually, since, even at this moment, it is the east gene.lly understood; but the other eight would lose notbing-on the contrary, they would gain-by being laid asde one season and revived tho next. Thus compositions of intrinsic worth, rarely if ever played, could be now and then brought forward, and the Philharmonic repertory varied and enriched. What we have said, how. ever, does not deprive the following selection of one atom of its value:- PART L. Sympbon7 in D.rfozert.

Coaductor-Pro es-or Eterudalo nennett. The vigour and undying freshness which make Figaro and Don Giovanni as new and stimulating at the present time as when they were first composed, three-quarters of a century ago, are jusb as remarkable in the orchestral symphonies of Mozart, whose melodies enjoy this advantage over the melodies of his rival and contemporary, Haydnthat they appear to be endowed with the gift of perennial youth. It is astonishing-the vast number of his imitators taken into consideration, together with that marked character which stamps every one of his productions with an unnistakeable individuality -how triuiphantly the music of Mozart has defied the encroachments of time, Even his diction (if we may apply such a term to musical phraseology) has psreserved its force; and we never dream of apologizing for Mozartas we must often do for Haydn and (naturally) stiU oftener for Handel-on the plea that we are listening to the music, and consequently to the form and language, of the last century. The reason is olear. Mozart's forms have bean developed by Beethoven and others-but theyhave not been changed; while bis ideas, like those of Shakspeare, the spontaneous offspring of genius, not merely reflections of the peculiarities and modes of expression belonging to an epooh, are as appropriate now as then, destined, in shost, for the edification and delight of all ages. To change the first (as modern sophists advocate) would be fatal to musio, to imitato the last successfully would requiro another Mozart. No matter what phases the art may have assumed from time to time under the creative influence of genius, the universal verdict of judges has consistently awarded the palm of supremacy to Mozart who in his Requiem equalled fandel; in his instrumental compositions surpassed Haydn and laid the foandations of that edifice which Beethoven built up to such a towering height; and in his vocal music isstill alone andcunapproachable. The sym hony (the one without a minuet) performed last night vwth such admsirable precision, and in a style so unaffected and so truly in the spirit of the author, under the direction of Professor Sterndale Bennett, is a masterpiece from and to end, and will be heard with interest so long as music continues to minister to the gratification and instruction of mankind. The wonderful overture of Mendelssohn transports the audience into another werld. This is not abstract music, like the symphony of Mozart; but what Herr Wagner, in his fantastic way, would designate "programme music"in other words, music suggested by certain natural phenomena. It is music, for aU that, and such music as no living composer could now produce. Excited and moved by the scenery of the Iebrides, and more especialy by that singular caprice of nature known as " Fingal's Cave," Mendelssohn gave vent to his feelings in the language congenal to his nature, and in which he had the secret of being most eloquent. The result was an inspiration of romantic beauty, wild and capricious as the scene which had suggested it. One of the marvels of this overture is that such a seemingly intractable sabject should, with consummate skill, have been compressed and moulded into a form as clear and symmetrical as that to which we bave already done homage in allusion to the music of Iozart. But Mendelssohn was pre-eminently an artist, and to his ardent and penetrating mind musio without intelligible and consistent shape was not music at all, but a mere chaos of sound. lWhat inexhaustible variety a religious adherence to the imperishable rules of art mav admit is successfaUy shown in The Isles of vFingal, which contains more genutne romance, more gorgeous colouring, more uncurbed and felicitous expression, more striking contrast, genuine poetry, and absolute originality than all the emanations from the "n ew school" put together; and these are restrained within bounds by that masterly conduct which leaves the impression of a comprehensive whole, with beginning, middle, and end. The execution of Mendelssohn's overture last night reminded subscribers of the best days of the Philharmonic; and the overture being encored was rented with increased effect. Such a performance was worthI a concert in itself. The C minor symphony could hardly have gone with greater spirit, the only point open to criticism being the crCecencdo leading from the schemo to the finale, which was not sufficiently gradual in its transition from piilO toforlisssimo. Weber's fery overture left nothing to be desired. The solos were interesting. Ernst's very fine Concerto Patheique, or rather Allegro PaWlktique-since there is only one movement-which was first introduced at the Philharmonow Concerts by the composer in 1849, tested the capabilities of M. Remenyl, solo violinist in Her Majesty's private band, to the utmost. M. Remenyi (a Hungarian) is a player of unquestionable abUlity; but we think the piece in question-one of the most difficult ever com. posed for the instrument-is at present beyond his powers. It contains bravura passages, in octaves and double notes, which, unless played in perfcot tune, are rather unpleasant than effective; and M. Remenyi did not exactly succeed in reaizing the intonation desired. Iu other parts-the cantabize especially, and the legato PaSSages Of disPlaY in a lesser degree-he was infinitely more successful. On the 'whole his performanee was highly meritorious. Though his tone is somewhat thin, his expression when not exaggerated is good; and, judged from the point of view of mechanism, he is evidently a performaer of more than ordinary talent. He was greatly applauded ati the conclusion. The concertino by Signor Bottesini was a prodigious ezhibition of manual dexterity, accompanied by musical taste and sentinient of the highest order, from first to last. To look for such a wonderful display from any other living professor of the double-bass would be vain. Signor Bottbpini is the undisputed king of his unwieldy instrument, and wherever he plays he astonishes and enraptures connoisseurs, as he did last night, when his performance created an enthusiasm. The vooal music was unexceptionable. Miss Lascelle sang the beautif-l air of Cherubini well, and Mirs. Erderssobn the well-known romance from Guillaurse Tell to general satisfaction. Still more acceptable were the charming two-part songs of Mendelssohn ("Greeting" and "May Bells"), the first of which, admirably gien by the two ladies, was warmly applauded by the audience.
ESCAPE Oi PR5SOrRIS FaRoM BRTSTOL GAOL.- Yesterday morning It was discovered that two prisoners had escaped from Bristol GaoL Their names are Joseph StiUlman and George Parr, both tried at the late Glocester assize and sentenced, the former to 15 years' transportation for a highway garotte robbery, and the latter to 12 months' imprsonment for coining. The prisoners, who were in th3 infirmary of the gaol, were seen safely in their beds at 9 oclock on Sunday evening, but on the warder going his rounds at 4 o'clock on the following morning the men wore missing. It was then found tbat they had suFplied themselves with a number of -worsted'comforters, orming part of the wearng apparel of other prisoners, which they tied togetlher, and havng got outside the prison. threw the rope thus made over the boundary wall, climbed uP, and then dropped themselves outside, a distance of about 18 feet. No traces being found of any of the lockrsof the prison having been picked or tampered with, the inference is that some of the omcers of the gaol must have been grossly negligent in the performance of their duties, or must have connived at the escape of the prisoners. Officers have been de atched in ursuit p of the criminals invarIous directions,

EQUALIZATION OF THE POOR-IRATES. TO THE EDITOR OF TETE TUIME. Sir,-It is a matter of congratulation to some of us to find that tho ratepayers and the public have at length become alive to the absolute necessity of an immediate change in the present unequal system of rating for the relief of the poor* The press is now working hardto assist us. It is worthy of remark that the inequality against which we have so long complained is getting worse year after year. The smaller rates now paid in some parishes in the city ol London, from which the poor have been driven through the making of improvements, and the increase of the rates in others intowhich they have necessarilybecome located prove this assertion. In the parish of Sb. George, Southwarlk, and in many other of the poorer districts the pressure for relief has become of late exceedingly heavy, so much so as to compel the levying of poor-rates in St. George's for the present and the next quarter at 14d. in the pound, which if taken ae that rate for the year, after police and county rates are deducted. anmounts to 3s. 8d. in the pound per annum ; while some parishes in the wealthy districts, which were formerly paying 2s., are now only rated at 7jd. in the pound. This reduction ismainly owing to the existing laws of settlement, which prevent the gaining of a parish by one year's hiring and service as formerly. In reference to St. George's parish the District Officer of Health, Mr. Rendle, in referring to sanitary arrangoments, in his quarterly report, says, " Our courts and alleys are ful of pauper population, ful of poverty and bad arrangements, and consequently full of disease ;" and he then truly observes, "that we, in common with other poor parishes, are not bearing our own burdens only. Our poor work at the waterside-the city and the docks. Their productive labour helps to enrich and to pay the rates in other parishes, but iD difficulty and sickness they live and lean upon us." The existing laws of settlement and poor removal are known to be cruelly oppressive to the poor and expensive to the ratepayers. They have been long ago denounced and condemned by committees of both Houses of Parliament, and long ago they ought to have been repealed. Let us, then, extend the area of rating, and this crSing evil wiU at oneo be abated or removed. An equal rate is required, which should be levied upon an uniform assessment of property accdrding to its value throughout the metropolis. Some persons express a fear that by such proposed alteration tho present system of local management would be disturbed. But this is not at all necessary in equalizing the burden of the rates ; nor can the local assistance of guardians in the administration of relief ever be dispensed with. I have suggested a plan which I published some years ago, notice of which was given in the House of Commons, that from an average of the expenditure of previous years it could at once be ascertained what would be required for the outlay of the following year, when an equal rate might be levied over the metropolis. This could be done upon an uniform assessment, which could probably be made satisfactorily by the justices in each county; for the magistrates have already the power, and are required under the Act the l5thand 16th of Victoria, cap. 81, to astertain and to decide upon the value and assessment of property in the several parishes for the purposes ot country-rate expenditure ; and in doing this they are not guided by the present unsatisfac. tory mode of rating for the purposes of the poor. Hence it will be found that the aesessments for county-rates are very different from those for poor-rates. A general treasurer should be appointed, to whom the overseer should pay over the moneys after collection, and upon whom the guardians should draw what is required for the relief of the poor, instead of making these calls upon the overseers, as at present. Of course, this should be done under the supervision of auditors and proper inspectors, who would be empowered to check the expenditure of the rates collected. It has been said that the adoption of this proposal would lead to centralization; but why should it do so when the whole powerof admiristeringrelief mustremaininthe hands of the local authorities, as at present ? The contrary is not proposed or suggested. Then, we are told that this alteration would be unjust to the inhabitants of those rich parishes who are now paying EO littlo towards the maintenance of the poor. But let us look at the facts. In the year 182 the expenditure in tho metropolis for the relief of the poor amounted to 602,1491., which would have made an average rate upon the present assessment of Is. 3d. in the pound, but which would also, if made upon the property-tax assessment, have amonnted to only about iod. in the pound. There was a large increase of expenditure of poor-rate in the year 1856, but even this would have been covered by an equal rate apon the property-tax assessment of ls. 3d. in the pound. Now, iu the metropolis, excluding the city of London, it is weU known that the Ipolice and county rates are included in the poor-rates; so that if the lOd. iu the pound (namely, 6d. police and 4d. co uty rates), now charged for these purposes is added to Is. 3d., it would make 2s. Id. in the pound per annum, or 6id. for each quarter, including these police and county rates. Then, if the "extra parochial " places were charged as they should he, additional rates would be received; and if the pass. ing of the poor from one parish to another, even in the metro. polis, was stopped (as it must be, with a metropolitan rate) andilitigation uDonmappeals consequently prevented in the 7etropolitan districts, a considerable saving would be effected, and the equal rates would then be even lower than the above calculation. Now, if facts and figures are referred to, it wil bo found that if this propoeal for equal rates were adopted but very few places i the metropolis would have any increase of charges whatever; and whero they had a slight addition it might make some tri5fing increase, but probably not more than about 3 per cent. But, the very few places which would in this way be eo slightly affected contai n the best mansions, the finest dwelling-houses, and the most valuable prolerty in the metropolis - and these are rated and occupied by a clas of persons who are, above all others, the most interested in the protection of property and the promotion of peace, order, and contentment among all classes of the people. Surely, then, the wealthy of this great metropolis will willingly contribute a little more, if necessary, to n poorrate, in order to effect equal rating, if this bo the means of preventing the constant shifting of pocr destitute persons irom one overburdened parish to snother, as at present. It is known that this is often done forthe purpose of getting relieved of the expense of granting a very moderate assistance, which is in many eases absolutely required to savethe lives of ourp Por destitute fellow-ereatures, who are not to be permited to perish in this Christian land. The heartrending disclosures made by the present Lord Myor, in his humane investigations relative to the treatniens of the casual poor, in this the richest city on the face of tho globe, will not soon be forgotten. Equalize your rates, and then the wealtby parishes, now shirking their fair proportion of the burden, in consequence of the present defective system, would pay their share of the smatl cost required to house tho destitute and to provide them with aosemmodation fit for human beings to be placed in. Let us have equal rates, and tben, and not till hen, inendiciy end beggimg may be prevented; in which case the county-sates may be considerably reduced by the prevention of petty offences, which are now frequently committed owing to the poor being indiscriminately driven from parish to parish before they can obtain shelter. Mlay we not then hope and expect that the large majority of ratepayers in this vast metropolis, who are so thoroughly interested in this great socia question, will caU upon their representatives in Parliament to force upouthe Government the necessityof introducing a measure to the Legislature without further delay, in order to effect the important amelioration of the present law so well calculated to promote the good of the entire community?
