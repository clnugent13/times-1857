All begin by referring to'tfier vint : Jay, and the good advie they gave to tbe Kiakm about observing the latter a wvllasthe spirt of the firman, and execu'Qng it aXs as e un&arrre,ensie." They all expresiitheir regtet, thattheir advioehad not been followred, and thst.ithe Kaimakai has. entirely falsified (fauvs=) the a it appll aioa u 'bat, incaonsequence of 4sshificatioss, whirhtheyhive veified r consfit) their Government havesent them order to protet ganst the Diva anull: They declare therefore that they can have no communication whatever with the Divan, such as it is, and instruct their agents in Jassy to bring this protet to the knowledge of the local Gov=inment. The two featuresa which are alone remarkablein this protest are-first that the commision has vedified the falfication of the firman, and then tht it is by order of their respective Governments that the four coDmMisioers protest. 0f course, I have not seen the proofs which have beei conmuni6ated by the Unionists of Moldavia to the com ion at Bucharest, bxt it muat of course be a partil statement, which might, indeed, be strpng enough tg justify an inquiry; but, 'without being a enr of either side, I think it is unfair to decide without heaxing the other,party also, and without geving it an opportunity to reply to the charges made against it. As the Governments represented by the four comnmidOnets -who protested have identified themselves witti decsion, I don see how things are to be settlecL Ia a conuidoion like that now sitting at Bucha-rest there can be no question of a right of thfe majority. _11 steps must be-taken by common understanding, as in a jury, and, az the commismioners are allowed to et and dink mad amuse themselves, there is no chance of subduing either party in that manner. Under these circumntances, nothing remains but to take, as I said before, the question of Union ancd lNon-union out of the hands of the ooimission and of the Divans, .and settle it i some place in Europe. The Treaty of Paris say&sthat the organization of the Principalities shall be finElly settled at a congre to be held lu Paris. But France has taken a most prominent. part in the quarrel about union and nonunion, and I think it oiild be scarcely fair to the other parties that a. question to which they attchh, rightly or Trongly, so much interest ahould be declded'in t'E capital of the party which hu ut itself inoat prominently forward on the other sde :EnlaI5d is the o*ly Powver out of the seven which has-'znbraed no -side. London ought therefore, injudice to aRl paties, to be the place where this questionshould be-settled. It is a -great pitythat much' a reiution da not been taken before. 13ven .eore the commissiop. came ou 1Asi Paahai tbea Granld Vzier, addressed, about 12 month! ago, a ciclar notto all he Powers, in which he put forward the arguments of the TurkGsh ffovern ment agaist the nion, ind at the ena of which-he proposedie the P Qwers'o discuss and decide this' queston, lwhich. is politicl, and not adminisrtive, in-a calm, conference f the Cabinst before it wa envenomed by party pirit, and before it wasthrown on the field of ngitation. This advioe, which ought to have been followed during the dic ion of the Treaty of Paris, came rather late, but much confusion, aniniosity, and useless talking and writ, ing might have been saved had this adnce been followved even then. The Powers will probably have to come back now to it it they domiot wish the whole question of the organization of thePrincipaities to be jeopardized Before finishingo this aubject I cannot help saying something abotLt the circumstance which accompanied the protest of the three Consuls, a they are rather characteristic. The protests, although identical in their sense, are somewhat different in their wording. The strongest in its wording is t he Russian. Thi zight be rather surprising at first sight, .for duringtlw b3at-. 1jgr us1 h!s kept completely i the background, and let others acbin her stead. But if one reffews the whole course of her acvity in the upeipalites this proceeding seema:very natural. she wants to aflect indifference in order not to run the risk-of a defeat, but when the aim i sure she ruRhes forwvard ii order to have all the ckedit. One cannot :dgny that it is clever. y hi3, ,but it is surprising that the-others do-not see ib ntheir eagerness Howrever, passionate 'fury -seems to be the ordei of the day. This; 'eien the cbmmunication of the protests could not pass without giving rbe to bitter-words and recriminations. .Whatever one's private opinions be. about the worth of' the person who-isat the head ofa foreign Government, gentlemlyfeeling, nay, common decency and seIf-reepect? ozight to prevent differences between thehebad of : a Govermnent and the representative of a fornigniPower from degeneran into a schoolboy quarie, for. surely insulting the head even of the worst Government canot be in the instructions of any agent of a foreign Power. I havea succeeded at last In getting the true numbers of those of the. electors who voted, and of those who abstained. -Firtis the claws of -the clergy. Out of the 9 abbots, 5 came and voted; out of 143 priests, who were to have represented the ergy of the diocess of Jansy, only 3 came. In the diocess of Komaau, out of 25 inscribed on the electral lits 9 came; in the diocess of Huss all the 28 inscried on the lists came. In the class of the great prbprfetors, out of 482 who were on the lists 215 came and voted. The 2,336 small proprietors as well as the 16T,222 peasants, eame all in a body. . In the towns, out of :2,024 electors inseribed- 763 came. Thus you -see inthree classes the number of those wqo abstained is larger than that of those who came. Of course one must alwrays subit VWe who are absent or impeded, for I donet think there areany indifferents iere; but, even allowing this, the numbers-would, if anything, have been infavour of tshe Unionists. But, even if they had been equal, one must rememberthat aSll those who came are not absolutely aanst the Union; all those who are yet undecided, for instance, ae among them, and the number of these annot be very small in a country where there are a good ay people waiting Ã¯Â¿Â½or places. You see, then, tht my sertion -carried out by the fa*.. - If, atead of - = Wstaing, the Unionists had excied hemselves -to have their candidates- elected,' they might with a little management have obtained the retuzn of ihe majority of their candidates in spite of the electoral list, at leas in the three more important clales,the clergy, the great- proprietors, and the towin, which would have very likely gi:ven them 'the majoityitheDivanl. I tylink it womId have been better for their interests'to trust to their own honest exertions than to diplomatic promises, 3d thus gacrifice something tolerably good to something better, but very-uncertain.

The MUTINY of the 6th BENGAL C AVALRY. We have been favoured with tho following letter, detailing the circumatances under which one of the best regular cavalry regiments in the Bengal army revolted:- h Tullunder Doab, June 10. "I have indeed little heart to write, but, as the sad news of the matiny in our corps *ill go home by this mail. I camot refrain from writing to tell you that thank God, we we al safe. " I mnst explain as briefly as possible how all this missr-', eble business tcok place. After about a week of compsra tiVe quiet, we were put on the qus~ vise on the 3d inst. by a fire brealdng out in the men's inesof the 61st. On foe fOllowing niht they burnt the hoSitl. On the PtI a1l wees quiet. On the 6th a native troop of horse arti'dery mearoned into this station; the 4th Sikh Infantry also came in. I beliete that the reason oÃ¯Â¿Â½ the mnove oa the 13tt*. of the native troop was, that it was not considered safe to leave a native troop at a station where there Wm no European regi-. ment. The rrival of the 4th Sikhs, it appears, :3 ssead _at anxiety in the minds of the men of the native regisent' here, and the Brigadier, feing that sme of ohem would desert, ordered the Sikh regiment-oct of the'tation or. the evening of the ody on which they arsved. IlThe nativetroop wee-eucaznped in thfe Horse ArtiLery lines, and their KguM -were parked with thcseof the Europeantrcop. This brings qs ap to the morning of Sunday, the'Ith;,during the whole of the day evetrything was qet. 'Our men showed no -symptoms of nness'isesa, anmd~ wentosras usual. So quiet w everythin'tha.t'l the e'eaing~y wifo went to church trs- iveteriaey surgeon. I could niot Ro,3SsIwished to visi he liese, as haa been my invariabecustomever-ince hearing 'the lamentable news from Delbi. After cherch several of our regiment dined quietly -with us, and at l0 o'clock, having sen; my wife -to. sleep at the Artillery Barrracks with the -ether ladies and children, ;I went to bed at 11, with all my clotheson as4suaL. bad just cosed my eyes, when I heard one of my -guard call out that there was a fire. I j ampe&up, and sawf1herefection of fire in the direction of the S6tNativethdantry lines. I instantly mounted my horse, -ad rode- downe to our'lines as hard as I could gall op. On. reaching our men's lines .11 appeared quieti. I rode gently up between the-men's and horse lines, and had nearly reached hec lines of tihe secod troop, 'when I heard a shot ired in the diroction of the 36th lines. Not an instant elapsed before I saw a rush made by the men of the second zroop for the bell of arms, which they had reached before I -could get -up to them. I drew my sword, rode at them, and succeeded in driving them back to their lines, bat not until they had forced one of the doors. The troopers stood at the end-of their 1,hkeo, and I appealec to them in every posible way, reminded them of the distinguished name theirlaiheis had gained for the regiment, and told thom to prove they wera faithful soldiers by returning every man to his but. tIn the meantime I sent off to our commanding -officer, Macmullen, who was in the lines, to teU him what was going on.} The men seemed to have come to their senses, and I hoped tho panic was over, for they turned to obey me, and walked b-ak towards their -huts. Before they had reached them a brisk file firing commenced in the infantry lines; the men turned again ana made another rush towards the bell of arms. I stopped them at the bead of the troop, and swore I would cut theifirst man down who crossed the little ditch that runs acres the front of the lines. I kept them in check for a minute or two, during which I heard horses galloping, and, glancing in the direction of the sound, stt men galUoping out of the horse lines of the 3d squadron. A cry was raised that the 3d squadron had mounted, and ihe men of the right wing dashed off to the hell of arms. Irodo at them, and upset some Of the infatuaited scoundrels, bout it was of no use. One fellow drew his tuiwar, which he had in addition to his regimental stbre, and made a cut at my leg. Fortunately, I managjed to gard it. Some of the men tried to catch at myreirns; and, seeing that it wa all up, and that half the regiment waS mounted, I rode through them and galoped off towrds the artilery to warn them that our men were in o mutiny. I must tel yof tht the artillery lines are between the 36th Native Ianad Before I had lef the lines some of our men came at me and rode across the road afer me, close up to the baracks. I rode up to the orderly room, and told the first person I met, who happened tot be ll,l wha had occu2red, and told him to go off to the Briadier and warn him. I thes rode back ito our hles along the front of the horse lines, and found that almost all the men had made off. AsI rechedthe horse linea of the 1st troop I lwas overtaken by our quwrtermasterneorgeant, who told me that tacmullen hadjbeen shot by one ot our men. r instantly went off with the sergeant, and found poor Mhfacmuteny ishsome of theyother officers between the mden and horse lines of the 6th troop. He was wounded of the hand. Just at this tilme tere was a rush made toards aus by part of our mne, and, seeing that to remain was only to sacrifice our lives uselessly, I prevailed Otl Macmullen ti leave the lines and proceed to the aktilery Babracks, which was the rendezvous. On reaching the baracsm, wihere all the ladles were conregated, wae found poor Btashawe, the adjutant of the 36th, had ju8t been broirnet in severely wounded. It ape that some of our men rode off to the 36th and 61st lines and attempted to cut dopn all the officers they sawi They wounded three officers in the 61st, nd onea in the 36Sh, the scene at the barracks has one of the utmost confusion-ladies, children, servants, and soldiers all mi ed up together. An order was given for the ladies, children, kc., to be taken to a barrack nearer the aun sheds, and off they went, my wife in an awvful state, and our hlttle hey sitting on mny holster Epipe. We had nearly got them into their new quartez3 when yile fieing commenced from the direction of thue as. lines, the shot W histling throua the artiller lines. Shortly ie-ter the firing commenced some of our men made a dash nt the ngus, but were zeceived with a couple of rounds of grape and a smart volley of musketry, which stoppd thenm. I wasstarding in view of the guns, and saw theuwretche sheer off to the right. There is no doubt that they fully expected the Native Horoe Artillery to join them, and Iram told that they shouted to them to do so, but this I did noi hear myself. The native troop were by a judicious arrangement so dovetailed with the 1Europemn troope, and, in addition, had a company of the Ssh Foot to look rlter them, that had they wished it they could not have sold us. "We were troubled no mere by the mutineers, who seemed to have commenced their marc to Phillour on finding that it was hopeless to attempt to take our gouns The hours passed slowly enpugh till morning, and, to make matters still more uncomfortble, wewere treatedto a sand. storm, which at ocue blinded and choked uns. tAt 2 o'clock anm. tcmullen and Farqned3ubsn weunt into our lines and found many of our men there. They called the roll and took the tames of all the men who were present. 'his I did not knoW until afterwards. As e oon as day broke Ray, our riding master, and I whent to our stand rd guard, and to my great delightforlndthat the guard had remained at their post and Our standards were safe. I had been up to the guard during the night, bnt could not hear or see a soul, and concluded thtu they bd also gone off. We nt to the men's lnes, turned them oat, I and took the muster; the result wasm, at we found 1o6 men, not including the native non-oommissioned offlcer were present; doubtless many of them had gone off and " We bad 90 troopers on furlough, so that just one squad. ron of the regiment has joined the mutineers. However I have now no confidence in ny natbive. Some of o fr oest men have proved the mset actlve in this miserable business. A rough rider in mny troop, who had been riding my charger in the morning, and had played with my little child, was ene of the men who charged the guncst; hewa w wonded, and had the impudence to go up to our hospital. "On taking the muster in the morning ve compared it with the one which was taken by Frquhsrsonr, and ftoud that a native officer and ten men had returned subsequently to the muster being taken. These we made over to a party of the 8th ]Foot. We tried them bya drm-hed conrtmartial and had them shot. We received an order to make over all the horses and arms that remained to the Abtillery. The men were ordered to give up their arms and did it. It was a cruel sight, and we al felt it most bitterly. These we ore men in whom we had implicit conridence. "doThe 6th has now virtuey ceased to exist. OWr horses are al being given to Irregulars, or beingdraughted into the Arztillery, and our men guard their lines wvith bludgeons. "$It seems that after their attack on the guns, finlding that the native troop would not join them, the whole of the rnutineers left this station and marched for Philloar; and I believe the larger number of them were oat of this station by 2 in the morning. When tho mutiny oomEnenced we telegraphed to Phillour to break the bridge of boats to prevent the rascais crossing, ut, the men at Phil. lour being all, asleep, the message wvas passed on to lJm. ballab to be telegraphed hack to Phillour in ease the wire hetwsven this awzlPhillour should ho cut, which wa3S deoun very shortly after the m essage was sent. *-It appears the mnutineers marched into Phillour, took the 3d Native Infantry v,ith them, proceeded up 'to the Ghaut six miles up the river, where they procured hoa-; and cro^ssed. They were met on the opposite bank by the 4th Sikh Infamtry, who attacked them, hut from want of a.mmunition were obliged to fall hack. " Jue 12. We are now all quiet-our men perfectly so, hult dreadfully alarmued, as some scoundrels have been tell. log them that they are to 'be destroyed, and a hundred other lies. We have a great deal of wrork; we have to he con-e stantly with tbe men to cal.m their fears and restore con. ilidencee, if possible. &ood naews from Delhi, We have givenx the villans a sound drbbing and taken 26 of their gun.

The LonD CHNCBoizo resumed his seat on the woolsack at 5 oWelock. The Earl of SHAFTESBURY presented petitions from Taunton and Dublin against the traflic in opium; also a petition from inhlabitants of Jamaica, praying Her Majesty to enforce the treaty stipulations with Spaia, and Increase the naval force cruising off Cuba. The petitioners represented that there was concurrent evidence from a variety of souroes provingthe large increase during thepast three years in tho slave trade with the island of Caba; that the slave trade had been stimulated by the act of the Imperial Legislature of 1846 admitting alave-grown sugar into consumption upon the same terms as that produced from free labour; that the proceedings in the criminal courts of the United States proved that the trade was facilitated by the fact of its being carried on in vessels sailing under the American flag; that although Spain was bound by solemn treaties to suppress the slave trade, yet It was publicly notorious that it wae eanctioned by the authorities in Cuba, who participated in its profits; that such increase in the bmportation of slaves into uba, computed at upwards of 30,000 nnually, sadly miii. tated ainst the success of free labour in our own Coloniesg for which this country had made so great a sacrifice; the petitioners therefore prayed that Her ajest's Government would endeavour to enfore the treaty stipulations with Her Most Christian Majesty, would also increase the naval sqdron craising off Cuba, and, if the trade could not otherwise be suppresse establish an effectual blockade of the whole island. Lord CAMPBELIL presented a petition from Capar, in Fifeehire, against the BiWl having reference to aessments in Scotland; and another from the same body apinst the Lunaties (Scotland) BiLL STAMPS ON LETTERS. Lord CAMPBELL adverted to the illegibility of the stamps impressed on letters at the Post-office. It was important both for social and legal purposes that those stamprs, which at present wvere luttle better thn blotches, shouldnbe legible, and durnega recent important trial at Eidinburgh wreat inconvenienc arose from the stamops not being clear. The Dtamps on letters received from abroad were distinct and he wished to knowr from his noble friend at the head of the Post-offce, who he knew wcs exerting himself in order to render the stamps upon Euglish letters distinct, what hope there was of that objet being aceomplished ? The Duke of ARaYLL said that, in. consequncre of his attention being directed to this subject by hsnoble and learned friends, he had made inquir.ies respecting the stanip. ingof lotlers, and he had ascertaed that the real difficlty arose fron the great amount of stamping done by o manl thbour. vi his noble and learned fend w.er to attend the Post-ofice at 6 o'cocat he would witness the marvellous rapidity and accuracy writh which the proess of stamping was effected on hundreds of thousands of letters. An infinite number of suggestions with respect to the stamping of letters had been sent to the Post of1ice wdthm the last few months, very much wI consequence of the observations made by his noble and learned friend. There was nO doubt that manual labour could never effect the purpose so perfectly as a machine, but A macill hawd been invented by a genteman connocted with the Post-offie3 which promised to produce a creat amendment. The supeiority of the foreign stmps might be attributed to the comparatively smaU correspondence with wvhich foreign post-offices had to deal, and still more to the use of letter paper nlot sO highly glaed as that generally used In this country, tChrog Banurnt and Insolvency (Ireland) Bill went LUNTICS (SC:OTLAND) DIL.

SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS BEFORE JUSTICES OF THE PEACE BILL, On the motion that their lordahips go into oommittee, Lord CAMPBELL said, he thought this Bill likely to be a beneficial measure. After it received the Royal assent, if a point of law arose in any proceedings before a magis. trate which was decided unsatisfactorily to the losing party an appeal would lie to the superior courts at Westminster. The facts were to be determined exclusively by the magistrate, and the appeal was only given upon any disputed point of law. The Bill then passed through committee. JURISDICTION IN -SIA? BILL This BiU also went through committee. THE EARL OF CARYSFORT. Lord MONTEAGLE moved that the petition of Lord Carysfort, Claiming to vete for Irish representative peers, be referred to the Lord Chancellor for examination and report. Lord REDEDDALE said that the claim of Lord Carysfort was inconsistent with a resolution adopted when there was a full attendance of Irish representative peers, and although he was not opposed to some alteration of the rtsolution, it would be better not to repeal it in so thin a House, and at a moment when there was not a single Irish representative peer left in London. Lord CAMPBELL suggested that the best course which noble lord (Lord Monteagle) could pursue would be to move that th-estanding order bearing upon the subject of his motion should be amended. The LORD CHANCELLOR conourred in that opinion, and Lord ONlITEAGLE, acting upon the suggestion, withdrew his motion, and gave notice that he should take an early opportanity of carrying out the object which he had in view by moving the amendment of the standing order. The Bishop of OXFORD presented petitions from the rchdeaconry of Bath and the deanery of Wallingford against the Divorce Bil. The Hfouse adjourned at 20 miuvtes to 7 o'clock.

' ROYAL COMMIS3ION.- M-r. Palm/to, Yeoman*"Cfsher of the Black Rodj appeared * a the bar and summoned the House to attend at the bar of the House ef Lords to hear the Royal assent given by commission to several BUls passed by both Houses. The Speaker, accompanied by a few members, immediately responded to the summons, and on their return the titles of the Acts (for which see Lords' Report) were read by the Clerk at the t«b!e. Baring's Divorce BiU was read a third time uid passed. COMMITTEE ON OATHS. Lord J. RUSSELL brougbt np the report of-"the selectCommittee appointed to consider whether the Aot Sth and 6th WUliam IV., cap. 63, is applicable to oaths appointed by law to be taken by members of this House at the table previous to taking their seats." The report was read by the Clerk at the table as follows:" The committee hava considered the matters referred to them. The following resolution was proposed by a member of the committee :- .*' That, in the opinion of thi3 committee, the House of Commons is included within ihe foUowing words of the 8th section of the 5th and 6th WUliam IV., cap. 62-that is to say,-'All bodies now by law or statute or by any valid usage authorised to administer and receive any oath.' "Upon deliberation ihe resolution was passed in the negative." Lord J. RUSSELL, in moving that the report lie on the table, begged leave to state, as he might be asked tho question, that he did not propose to go on with the Oaths Vslidity Bill, and he intended to move that the order ba discharged. At the same time, he wished to say that this subject was in that state tbat it was necessary that Parliament should consider it at the very commencement of next session. (Hear, bear.) He would therefore givo notice that early next session he would bring under the consideration of the House the oaths taken by members of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) The report was then ordered to lie on the table. SUNDAY BANDS IN THE PARKS. Mr. HANBURY asked the Homo Seoretary whether he had received a memorial on the subject of the Sunday bands in the parks being encouraged by the Government, whUe preaching was prohibited; and, if go, what answer Her Majesty's Government were prepared to give to the prayer of that memoriaL Sir G. GREY stated, in reply, that abont 10 days ago he received a memorial, signed by the rev. secretaries of three associations in the metropolis for the better observanoe of the Lord's-day and the encouragement of open-air preaching, complaining that whUe bands were permitted to play on Sundays in the Regent's and-Vietoria Parks, preaching had been forbidden. The parks in question were not- under the direct control of the Secretary of State, but nnder that of the Chief Commissioner of Works. At the same time he had no objection to answer the question which had been addressed to him. He had been assured that no direct sanction had been given by the Government to the ' playing of the bands on Sunday, Kiev were purely .' voluntary bands, aud the Government had done nothing : more than abstain from interfering with them. With the ' exception of the memorial to which he had referred, he had received no complaint in regard to tho playing of tho bands from the neighbourhood of either of the parks. (Hear, hear.) The grounds upon whioh the Chief Commissioner had prohibited preaching In the parks were, he thought, quite '. sufficient. It appeared that persons of different religious denominations were in the habit of advocating their views in the parks on Sunday, thus diverting those places from ? their legitimate purposes-the amusement and relaxation of the people. And the evil at last was carried to such an extreme that parties were found avowedly proclaiming atheistical andinfidel principles. Under these circumstances the Chief Commissioner thought it was impossible to allow poUcemen to exercise a discretion in the matter, and there-: fore withdrew altogether the permission which had been given to preach in the parks. (Hear.hear.) Sir B. HALL thought it was only fair that he; should state to the House what the aUegations In' the memorial were, and then give his answer to them. The: memorialists declared that they regretted that the playing: of private bands on Sunday afternoon had been resumed in i Regent's and Victoria Parks; that the platforms erectedthero at the pubUc expense were used by those bands, whUe: seats were let for hire, and programmes sold for the benefi", J of the performers; that whUe aU this was done with the sanction of the Chief Commissioner of Works the permission to preach had been withdrawn. He was sorry to say that those statements had littlo foundation in truth. (Hear, ? hear.) Afterthe discussion whioh took place last year the bands whioh had obtained the sanotion of the Government to their playing on Sunday were discontinued, in obedience to the expressed wishes of the House, and he had taken no part whatever in their renewal, The platforms npon which the bands played on week days were used on Sunday, and he thought he should not be justified in _i_king a collision with the people upon such a subject, (Hear.) Another aUegation' of the memorialists was that persons were prevented goingto the? parks in consequence of the disorderly conduct of tho peoplei during the playing of the band3. He had frequent reports' from the park-keepers and from tho superintendent of theparks, but he had not heard one single complaint of the1' conduct of the people; on the contrary, he beUeved that1 the cases before the magistrates on Monday had materiaUyj diminished. (Hear, hear.) Last year, during the playing; of the bands sanctioned by the Government, npwards of' 200,000 people visited the parks on Sunday, and yet not one, single case arising out of the bands came before the magis-. trates. (Hear, hear,) The grounds npon which he stopped preaching in the parks on Sunday might be shortly stated/ In a report whioh he received from the Superintendent ofi the Parks he waa informed that upon a Sunday in August; last year there were one Protestant minister, five EmmanueUtes (four males and one female), five total abstainers,, and 11 infidels preaching at the same time, one agaiuet the other. (A laugh.) The park-keepers took down some of the sentences which they heard uttered, such as, "Jf there is a God, He is the author of all evil;" "There is no evidence of a'future life;" The Deity is unknown to men;' and a great number of others with which he would not disgust the House. Upon the receipt of that report he felt ifc Sis duty to prohibit preaching altogether, behoving that a discretion could not properly be left to the superintendent or the park-keepers. (Sear, hear.) Lord LOVAINE asked for an explanation of the statement in the memorial that money was paid for admission to hear the music Sir B. HALL said there was no suoh statement in the memorial. What the memorialists said was that seats were let for hire and programmes were sold for the benefit of the performers. He knew nothing about the programmes; bat with regapl to the seats he might state that in aU the parks there were certain persons aUowed to let out chairs to those who wished to have them. SALARIES OF DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SER. VANTS. Mr. WISE asked the Seoretary to the Treasury whether it was intended to abolish the system of deductions beino made by certain officials at the Foreign Office from the salaries paid to Her Majesty's Diplomatic and Consulir Servants abroad. Mr. WILSON thonght that the form in which the hon. gentleman had put his question was calculated to' mislead: There was no compnlsaiy deduction from the salaries. Ministers and Consuls abroad were pleased to appoint certain gentlemen in the Foreign Office to act as their agents, and the deductions referred to by thehon. gentleman were the charges for suoh agency, which was the result of a purely voluntary agreement between the parlies. The system, however, was one whioh the Government believed to be open to serious objection, and the Treasury were now considering tho propriety of substituting some better arrangement. (Hear, hear.) WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (IRELAND). In reply to Sir W. Vbkneb, Mr. H. HERBERT said a BiU w_3 prepared for the regulation of markets and fairs in Ireland, whioh contained clauses for equalizing weights and measures at aU markets and fairs in that country, but he was not aware that there was any intention of introducing any other measure npon the subject. EMBODIMENT OF THE MILITIA. Mr. CORRY asked the Under-Secretary for War whether, in the event of a portion of the mUitia being embodied during the recess, it was the intention of the Government to caU out any Irish regiments. SbrJ.RAMSDENsaidthatif it should be found necessaiy to embody any part of the militia the first consideration would be to seleot those regiments which were in the most efficient state for immediate duty, but subject to that first consideration a fair proportion of regiments would be selected from England, Ireland, aud ScoSand. RECALL OF COMMODORE KEPPEL. Sir C.NAPIER asked whether it was true thai, notwithstanding the acquittal of Commodore Keppel by courtmartial, the Admiralty had reoaHed the gallant officer from the Chinese seas. ?_ c* WOOD, with the utmost deference to the House and to the hon. and gallant member, must deoline to answer the question. _ He thought it most inexpedient that the House should interfere with the appointments of officers by the Exeoutive. (Hear.) THE COMMON LAW COMMISSION. Sir J. PAKINGTON asked whether the reportof the Common Saw Commission, which had been printed and presented to the House, would be sent to aU the members. or whether copies of it would simply be deposited at the Vote-office. Sir G. GREY thought the report was an important daoument, anda copy should'be sent to every member as soon as a sufficient number, bad been printed. OATHS COMMITTEE REPORT. Mr. NEWDEGATE said he beUeved the noble lord the member for the oity of London, in presenting the report of the Committeo upon Oaths, had moved that it Bhould lie npon the table, but had not moved that it should be printed, which it was most desirable should be done. Lord J. RUSSELL.-I shaU move ? that the report be printed. THE CASE OF LIEUTENANT-COLONELS APPOINTED BEFORE 1851.

At the same time he had no objection to answer the question which had been addressed to him. He had been assured that no direct sanction had been given by the Government to the ' playing of the bands on Sunday, Kiev were purely .' voluntary bands, aud the Government had done nothing : more than abstain from interfering with them. With the ' exception of the memorial to which he had referred, he had received no complaint in regard to tho playing of tho bands from the neighbourhood of either of the parks. (Hear, hear.) The grounds upon whioh the Chief Commissioner had prohibited preaching In the parks were, he thought, quite '. sufficient. It appeared that persons of different religious denominations were in the habit of advocating their views in the parks on Sunday, thus diverting those places from ? their legitimate purposes-the amusement and relaxation of the people. And the evil at last was carried to such an extreme that parties were found avowedly proclaiming atheistical andinfidel principles. Under these circumstances the Chief Commissioner thought it was impossible to allow poUcemen to exercise a discretion in the matter, and there-: fore withdrew altogether the permission which had been given to preach in the parks. (Hear.hear.) Sir B. HALL thought it was only fair that he; should state to the House what the aUegations In' the memorial were, and then give his answer to them. The: memorialists declared that they regretted that the playing: of private bands on Sunday afternoon had been resumed in i Regent's and Victoria Parks; that the platforms erectedthero at the pubUc expense were used by those bands, whUe: seats were let for hire, and programmes sold for the benefi", J of the performers; that whUe aU this was done with the sanction of the Chief Commissioner of Works the permission to preach had been withdrawn. He was sorry to say that those statements had littlo foundation in truth. (Hear, ? hear.) Afterthe discussion whioh took place last year the bands whioh had obtained the sanotion of the Government to their playing on Sunday were discontinued, in obedience to the expressed wishes of the House, and he had taken no part whatever in their renewal, The platforms npon which the bands played on week days were used on Sunday, and he thought he should not be justified in _i_king a collision with the people upon such a subject, (Hear.) Another aUegation' of the memorialists was that persons were prevented goingto the? parks in consequence of the disorderly conduct of tho peoplei during the playing of the band3. He had frequent reports' from the park-keepers and from tho superintendent of theparks, but he had not heard one single complaint of the1' conduct of the people; on the contrary, he beUeved that1 the cases before the magistrates on Monday had materiaUyj diminished. (Hear, hear.) Last year, during the playing; of the bands sanctioned by the Government, npwards of' 200,000 people visited the parks on Sunday, and yet not one, single case arising out of the bands came before the magis-. trates. (Hear, hear,) The grounds npon which he stopped preaching in the parks on Sunday might be shortly stated/ In a report whioh he received from the Superintendent ofi the Parks he waa informed that upon a Sunday in August; last year there were one Protestant minister, five EmmanueUtes (four males and one female), five total abstainers,, and 11 infidels preaching at the same time, one agaiuet the other. (A laugh.) The park-keepers took down some of the sentences which they heard uttered, such as, "Jf there is a God, He is the author of all evil;" "There is no evidence of a'future life;" The Deity is unknown to men;' and a great number of others with which he would not disgust the House. Upon the receipt of that report he felt ifc Sis duty to prohibit preaching altogether, behoving that a discretion could not properly be left to the superintendent or the park-keepers. (Sear, hear.) Lord LOVAINE asked for an explanation of the statement in the memorial that money was paid for admission to hear the music Sir B. HALL said there was no suoh statement in the memorial. What the memorialists said was that seats were let for hire and programmes were sold for the benefit of the performers. He knew nothing about the programmes; bat with regapl to the seats he might state that in aU the parks there were certain persons aUowed to let out chairs to those who wished to have them. SALARIES OF DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SER. VANTS. Mr. WISE asked the Seoretary to the Treasury whether it was intended to abolish the system of deductions beino made by certain officials at the Foreign Office from the salaries paid to Her Majesty's Diplomatic and Consulir Servants abroad. Mr. WILSON thonght that the form in which the hon. gentleman had put his question was calculated to' mislead: There was no compnlsaiy deduction from the salaries. Ministers and Consuls abroad were pleased to appoint certain gentlemen in the Foreign Office to act as their agents, and the deductions referred to by thehon. gentleman were the charges for suoh agency, which was the result of a purely voluntary agreement between the parlies. The system, however, was one whioh the Government believed to be open to serious objection, and the Treasury were now considering tho propriety of substituting some better arrangement. (Hear, hear.) WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (IRELAND). In reply to Sir W. Vbkneb, Mr. H. HERBERT said a BiU w_3 prepared for the regulation of markets and fairs in Ireland, whioh contained clauses for equalizing weights and measures at aU markets and fairs in that country, but he was not aware that there was any intention of introducing any other measure npon the subject. EMBODIMENT OF THE MILITIA. Mr. CORRY asked the Under-Secretary for War whether, in the event of a portion of the mUitia being embodied during the recess, it was the intention of the Government to caU out any Irish regiments. SbrJ.RAMSDENsaidthatif it should be found necessaiy to embody any part of the militia the first consideration would be to seleot those regiments which were in the most efficient state for immediate duty, but subject to that first consideration a fair proportion of regiments would be selected from England, Ireland, aud ScoSand. RECALL OF COMMODORE KEPPEL. Sir C.NAPIER asked whether it was true thai, notwithstanding the acquittal of Commodore Keppel by courtmartial, the Admiralty had reoaHed the gallant officer from the Chinese seas. ?_ c* WOOD, with the utmost deference to the House and to the hon. and gallant member, must deoline to answer the question. _ He thought it most inexpedient that the House should interfere with the appointments of officers by the Exeoutive. (Hear.) THE COMMON LAW COMMISSION. Sir J. PAKINGTON asked whether the reportof the Common Saw Commission, which had been printed and presented to the House, would be sent to aU the members. or whether copies of it would simply be deposited at the Vote-office. Sir G. GREY thought the report was an important daoument, anda copy should'be sent to every member as soon as a sufficient number, bad been printed. OATHS COMMITTEE REPORT. Mr. NEWDEGATE said he beUeved the noble lord the member for the oity of London, in presenting the report of the Committeo upon Oaths, had moved that it Bhould lie npon the table, but had not moved that it should be printed, which it was most desirable should be done. Lord J. RUSSELL.-I shaU move ? that the report be printed. THE CASE OF LIEUTENANT-COLONELS APPOINTED BEFORE 1851.

Palm/to, Yeoman*"Cfsher of the Black Rodj appeared * a the bar and summoned the House to attend at the bar of the House ef Lords to hear the Royal assent given by commission to several BUls passed by both Houses. The Speaker, accompanied by a few members, immediately responded to the summons, and on their return the titles of the Acts (for which see Lords' Report) were read by the Clerk at the t«b!e. Baring's Divorce BiU was read a third time uid passed. COMMITTEE ON OATHS. Lord J. RUSSELL brougbt np the report of-"the selectCommittee appointed to consider whether the Aot Sth and 6th WUliam IV., cap. 63, is applicable to oaths appointed by law to be taken by members of this House at the table previous to taking their seats." The report was read by the Clerk at the table as follows:" The committee hava considered the matters referred to them. The following resolution was proposed by a member of the committee :- .*' That, in the opinion of thi3 committee, the House of Commons is included within ihe foUowing words of the 8th section of the 5th and 6th WUliam IV., cap. 62-that is to say,-'All bodies now by law or statute or by any valid usage authorised to administer and receive any oath.' "Upon deliberation ihe resolution was passed in the negative." Lord J. RUSSELL, in moving that the report lie on the table, begged leave to state, as he might be asked tho question, that he did not propose to go on with the Oaths Vslidity Bill, and he intended to move that the order ba discharged. At the same time, he wished to say that this subject was in that state tbat it was necessary that Parliament should consider it at the very commencement of next session. (Hear, bear.) He would therefore givo notice that early next session he would bring under the consideration of the House the oaths taken by members of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) The report was then ordered to lie on the table. SUNDAY BANDS IN THE PARKS. Mr. HANBURY asked the Homo Seoretary whether he had received a memorial on the subject of the Sunday bands in the parks being encouraged by the Government, whUe preaching was prohibited; and, if go, what answer Her Majesty's Government were prepared to give to the prayer of that memoriaL Sir G.

Meanwhile, it is consolatory to feel that, even with the fullest daily intelligence, England could not be doing more than she is. Acting unavoidably in the dark, ignorant alike of disaster and-of triumph, but looking only tothe ecd, ahe- continues to mend her beet - men and her fleetest ahips to the-Eaat; so that, let the worst befall her, it will be no fault .of hers. It takes a long time. to rise to the scale of a grand- operation. lWe are a long time about it, and a atill -longer time knowing what wve are about. By succsdve efforts of intelligence aa& reolution we ame at last sending out a- great expedition to India; and most of our readers will -have to open their eyes, and look atound, and sum up, and conipare, before they caii appreciate the magnitude of the work and its place in the world's history. Let them Imagine themselves, then, on the beach of Southwea lawt Saturday afternoon. They would there see two immense "clipper)' ships, eachmore than half aslarge again as the largest ship in NEasoN's fleet, towed fzom their anchorage by immense steamtugs, and each with about a thousma'nden on board, of whomn near nine hundred were soldiers for the reconquest of our Ixdian Empire. Iustead of two buch ships, objects of admiration even to those who see *x6i-deckers everyday, let us suppose forty, most of themn filled with men, A few with the materials of war, and then you have an Armada which combines in one the adventurous spirit of early days, the vast ides; of modem times, the, hardihood of a rude age and the science of a civilized one. The joint expedition of England and France to the Crimea surpassed everything in ancient or modern times, including even the vast struggles of the latter Power at the close of the great war. But even that must yieldE in turn to the grander fact of an army of -30,000 well trained soldiers, well found and well officered, despatched in the oourse of three months from England right across the gliobe, to reassert our authority on- the shores of the-gesg and- the central plains of Hindotan. Thit is - the number which will have left thiscountry, before the end of this monich, and- which may be expected to land at Calcutta before the season favourable for aLtive -operationa. Even so recently - as the first day of this year, when we were only brething, as it were, from the vast efforts of the laWtEufopean war, and -when we were sufflciently annoyed to find ourselves involved in qiuarrels with W Peria and China, perhaps the most incredible thing that could have 'been suggested would have been an expedition of 30,000 men to 'India. That, however, is What we have actually come to. before seven months were out. It is true we have come to it step by step ; ve have done it, by in4talaeiats. A- for*ceof -AboV 5,400 'despatched to China at the beginning of the year has been diverted frd* it cours and is-probably by this time steaming up the Gauges, or face to face with the mutineers,Since the news of the, presen t outbreak about 103.5O Infantry, 1,350 CavalryX and 1,250 ArtiMlery, maling altogether near 13,000 men, have-been already embarked directfor India. About 5,400 more are now in course of embareation. Thus far is familiar to those of our readers who ha4e paid attention to our daily Military Intelligence.- But, in addition to the above, the lst Dragoon Guarda the 7th Hssars, the 44th, 56th, 66th, and 72d Regiments, a thousand Royal Artillery, aud draughts not far short of a thousand, have been placed under orders for India, and will be despatched during this week and the, next. All these amount to about 30,000 men. Now, this in a very great affair, and it is time to consider it in all its bearirgs. it Is a serious call on the military resources of a country which is so much an object of suspition and rivalry that any appearance of pressure or difficulty on one side'is stir to be improved to our disadvantage oil another. But it is necessary to be prepared for other demands on our army. Accordingly, for the 30,000' 34en sent out to India-not to speak of the troops-to be sent to China in place of thow aresea in their coure-Government has wisely resolved to em-- body, thirty Militia Regiments, and to r4be 7iauy regiments of the Line to their fuil compleinent. There is, however, no occasion to expect- a much greater los of life than usually ocluros in our army at home, where idlenes and its usual accompaniments every year do the work of the battlefield. Of these 30,000 men -the probability is that two-thirds will retun to tell many a tale of strange adventnie, of battle and siege, -of pursuit and assault, of difficulty and tuiumph.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMES-OFFICE, Tw4day MsW. FRANO1S1 (BY SUBBAI1NE AND BRITISH TRLERAPIL; We have received the foUowing telegraphic dew wpatch from our Parls correspondent.- "PARIS, TuRSDAY, AuG. 11, 7 Am. "The Emperor a-iuved at Hv2e at 12.40 this morning."
EXPRESS FROM PARIS: 'The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Monday), 6 p.m -- It was never believed that any serious quarrel between France and England would follow from the difference on the Moldavian elections. A good deal of the difflculty is attributable to the impradent tone of the articles in the Afciuteur, and probably to the Indiscretions of the French Connssioner in Walla. chia-indiscretions which were so patent in the beginning as, it was isaid, to require an admonition, if not a reprimand, from his superiors That the Paris press has shown wonderful unanmity In ftvour of the union of the Pr.cipalities, and against the Kaimakan Vogorides, is undeniable; but it is easily explained. That England is supposed to ba against the union is of itself sufficient for the Legitimist papers to defend it. The Republican Siicle is the great advocate of what is termed iwaitics: it regards Austria as the implacable foe of national independence; it considers that the union of the provinces would inevitably lead to the existence of an independent Roumain State, whether republic or kingdom, and whatever tends to weaken Austria as, of course, good in the eyes of the &Ude. The loss of Transylvania, the Bukovine, and the Banat, and Austria's expulsion from Lombardy, are, according to it, the greatest blesings that could befal Europe. As for the Conetiutionrsel and Pays, they support the Government because they cannot do otherwise. What side they would take if they were not seaiofficial organs I do not pretend to say, but it natu rally detracts from the value of their advocacy that they are bound by the conditions of their existenca to defend the Government policy, of whatever kind it be. The matter, however, is likely to take a new turn, which will disappoint those who hoped to see in the elections of Moldavia the germ of serious misunderstanding between France and England. It is said that a despatch was yesterday received from the French Minister, that the conference at Osborne had a satisfactory result, and this day it is stated that the pending difficulties are to be submitted for solution, like those on Bolgrad, to a conference of the representatives of the Powers interested. It also appears that it was the Emperor himself who suggested this solution. The despatch adds that Lord Stratford de Redoliffe, whose name seems to frighten the Ministerial journalists out of their wits, is expected in a few days in England on leave of absence. Where the new conference will be held is not stated, but It will probably be either Paris or London. The following private telegraphic despatch has been received:- "' MARSEILLES, AUGuWSr 10. The accounts from Genoa of the 8th inst. inform us of the execution of two convicts, and of the continuation of the effervescence whloh has declared itelf in the convicprison. A conspiracy has been discovered, of which the object was the escape of the convicts by mnurdeing the gaolers. An attempt was made to murder two tarnkeys. " The Gaeetta del Popoto says thatthe convicts axe fuxious ut the failure of the last oonspiracy, because Mazzini promnsed to free them. "The Neapolitan refugees announce that in publishing the manuscripts left by Piacaae. they will suppres the political parts." Captain Tardy de Montravel, of the Imperial Navy, who was appointed to the command of the island of New Caledonia, has by the resignation of Captain Dubouzet been promoted to the command of all the French possessions in the Pacific Ocean. Another Governor of New Caledonia will be placed under the orders of Captain de Montravel. A marble bust of Prince de Canino is to be placed in the Museum of Natural History in Paris. M. de Gabriae, the French Charg6 d'Affaires in Mexico, is to be appointed to a similar position in another of the South American States. There are a few branches of industry in Paris better off than others, but, generally speaking, trade Is very dull. One strong proof of the falling-off in connercial operations is to be fotnd in the diminished receipts of the principal railway companies. This diminution cannot be attributed solely to the cessation oi the transport of corn, but to a general relaxation in tie conveyance of merchandise. The Parisian shonkeepers hardly hope for any revival of trade worth mentioning before the end of next month. The manufacturers of winter staffs begin to prepare even now for the return of customers from the wateringplaces, as it will take some time to make a proper assortment of fancy articles. The absence of many of their hands, now employed in getting in the harvest, necessarily limits the production of the manufacturing establishments. According to advices from the south, those who sent their merchancise to the fair of Beaucaire have no reason to be dissatisfied with the result. The greater part of the goods offered for sale has been disposed of on excellent terms for the sellers. The meeting was attended by numerous buyers from Piedmont, Coraica, and Algeria. Silk handkerchiefs brought 10 per cent. more than last year; drapery from 6 to 8 per cent.; hemp from 2 to 3; hides, dressed and raw, 20; and wGol 10 per cent. Al other articles brought higher prices than last year. Flour rose in the Paris market at the beginning of last week in consequence of the drought, which prevented the millers from grinding. The rain which has fallen since then must have removed the adifficulty in a great meaure. It must not be forgotten that the stock of flour on hand is low; the quantity in the Paris market stores is 7,674quintals. Vhe bakers made no purchases onx Saturday, and it is supposed that they have sufficient for their conBumption until the 15th. The last prices quoted on Saturday are 115 sacks, at from 64f. to 69f. the sack of 157 kilogramnes for immediate delivery. There is a difference of 1Of. between the price for immediate delivery and for time bargains. Tiere was a fal of 70c. the hectolitre in the prica of wheat in the last Paris corn-market, and millers were unwilling to purchase even at that reduction. 400 sacks of wheat, to be delivered at the end of September, and weighing 120 kilogrammes the sack, were sold at 36f. each, being eqivalent to 24. the hectolitre. The harvest and the gathering home the wheat have been, thanks to the hot weather, effected with incredible rapidity. It is now ascertaired that, notwithtanding the late improvement, the oat crop will not be abundant. The crop in the Beauce and in Champagne is partioularly lighlt. The price is farm at from 19L to 22L the 100 klol grammes. Aocolte frota Maseilles of Saturday last atato that h sale of wheat ia beooming every day more difficult. The Government is said tohave adoyt4 i revobitiou relative to thle sale of butcherx' t 4 Bi 'ris, andz it is expeted that a deme -tyill be. .hoxtly published abolis"g the asize or dfli -tiee~ of meat, suppressing the market at Poiny, declaring the trade of butcher free in Parts, aud establishing a great central cattle market at the gates of Paris. It is hoped that these measures wi put an end to the continued rise in the prioe of meat. The butchers deny that the high priee of meat is to be attributed to them, but to the insuificiency of produce and the increase of connmption. To this the reply given is that the difference of priee is too great between.Pris and the departments. For example, the ibfiflitint of Paris Pays at this moment If. a pound for beef, whiel is to be pur. chsed in the departments, of equally good quality; at 14 sous. The high price of butchers' meat in Paris canses,moreover, an increase in the price of fowl,eggus, and vegetables. The intense heat of the weather until last Wednesday, and the want of rain, have caused some Injury to the vineyards. Letters from Maeiles, Lyons, Bordeaux, and Toulouse are unanimous in describing the danger to be apprehended from acontinuance of such scorching weather. The rain, which fell abundantly since Tuesday, appears, happily, to have been general,and 'will probably remove all danger.

(FEOM OUR ow0 CORnrSPONDMc.) VM-NA, AUG. 8. The Trieste merchants complain that thiir eity is not thriving, but the subjoined figures are not calculated to impress one with the idea that they speak truth. In 1841 the value of the goods imported was 49,000,000 florins, and the value of those exported 57,500,000 forims. in 1851 the imported goods were worth 97,000,000 forbis, and those exported 58,600,000 forins. InI 1856 the value of the imported goods was 120,, 74,000 florigs, and of those exported 102,492,000 floris. Baronvon Reden, who is considered one of the first statisticians in Germany, thus speaks of Trieste:- "T the tre vocation of Trieste is to maintain the commercial connexion betwveen Central Europe and the EBt. The Aushian flag has no need to fear competition ip th| Levant, in Asia Minor, and in the north-east of Africa ; for in those countries missionsres, consuls, and the LlOyd have made the name of Austria respected. When the canal of Suez is cut, Germany cannot fail, by the mediation of Tzieste, to establish very large commercial relations With Southern Asia and Eastern. Africa" On reading the foregoing your memory may, perhaps, revert to one of my recent letters, in which it is said that Austria well knows that no Power iQ Europe would profit so much as herself by a canal through the Isthmus of.Suez. A person, who is often well-informed of what is passing here behind the scenes, states that the Austrian Government is terribly afraid of being forsaken by England on the question of the Danubian Principalities, bub there is no reasoa to believe that the British Government will take any decisive step in the matter without previously coming to an understanding with the Imperial Cabinet, with which it is at present on a very friendly footing. We learn from St. Petersburg that the Russians are proceeding with energy against the inhabitants of the upper part of the eastern coast of the Black Sea. Not long since Russian troops landed near the fortress of Gelendaschick, and destroyed a very large quantity of smuggled goods, after having defeated the Circassians and "taken three guns." It is also related that Schamyl has been totally defeated, but Russian bulletins rarely or never deserve credit. According to the Insalide, a very severe lesson had been given to the Turcomans on the south-east coast of the Caspian. The Turcomans, having plundered some towns and villages on tne coasts of the Persian provinces of Asterabad and Mazanderan, and attacked Russian merobant vessels, Captain Licharew, "the commander of the As. terabad station," resolved to panish them. Accordingly he, on the 24th of May, marched, with 116 men and four guns, to a Turooman "a6ul," called Tumatsch. After the aul, or fortified village, had been bombarded and set on fire, some of the elders appeared, and delivered over to the Russians certain of their fellow-countrymen who had fallen into their hands. Before he left the spot Captain Licha. rev reduced the aul to a heap of ruins. The inhabitants of Mic and Guermani, in the western part of the Pashalic of Scutari, refused to supply the means of sending on the baggage belong. ing to troops which had been landed at Antivari, and fled into the mountainis when the Pasha sent men to force them to do so. The troops took possession of the two villages, and a message was sent to the fugitives to the effect that their houses would be reduced to ashes if they did not return within three days. The probability is that the poor wretches will take refuge in Montenegro, as they well know that if they return they will at once be put into the ranks. Almost all the villages in Albania refuse to supply recruits and to pay the taxes recently imposed by the Porte. Local news, in the strict sense of the word, we bave none, excepting that the harvest has far surpassed all expectations. ITAL.Y (iox OUR OWN OORRPOIzn.) TÃ¯Â¿Â½UlIN, A.UGUsT 7. It would appear that the principal duty of correspondent here at present is to contradict the ingenious inventions put forth by journalists slsewhere as news from Italy. Only the other day I had to assure you of the untruth of the report of the Sardinlan Government uaving made advances through the. French Minister at Vienna for a reconciliation'of dipromatic differences with the Austrian Court, and now I must give an equally positive denial to the assertion that Count 1lavour has addressed a circular to the Sardinian diplomatic agents abroad. desiring them to explain to the Governments to which they are accredited the conduct of the Ministry here in the affairs of Genoa and Leghorn, &c. To the Neapolitan Government every information regarding the persons who left in the Cagliari was promptly afforded, I believe, bub ib Is probable that to no other. GBovernment did Count Cavour oonsider-himciÃ¯Â¿Â½ in any way acountable .at all events, it in quite pertain that no such eircular as that alluded to ha3 beetx issued from the Foreign,offve here. But if. the rardini*n Government. has remained sient on this oocasion'the Neapolitan Governmment has not, for I understand that a very viol,et, circular was Addresd on the lIt of July last by MA Caraffe, Lhe Neapolitan. Ministext for Foreign Affairs, to hisagenit abroAd, wherein the S%rdinian governm,ent is openly accusedof aiding or abetting the Mizzinian conspiracy, and this oircular they were directed to communicate to the different Govera- ments to Which they are samedited, and Sign,or Canofari, the Neapolitan Chrg dAffaires here, pecially instruted to lay the same before 1uit I Cavour. Notwithstanding these speclal instuotionD however, Signor Canofari hla never made any allusions to this circular, it appears, in his communications with the Turin Cabinet, nor has this Government received. any offcial intimation of its existence,-in fac tunderstand that the Neapolitan Miistry and its agents have been invariably most honeyed in their tones to this Government lately, though from other sources we are enabled to appreciate the-real feelings of the Neapolitan Government towards its neighbour. For some time past the King of Naples has paid his tribute to the power of public opinion by sub sidi2ing papers or journalists in difrerent parts of Europe, and from time to time, since the wvithdrawal of the French and English legations from Naples, the world has been enlightenIed by the appearance of pamphlets on -the subject. These writings have generally been more veciminatory than exculpatory, as though the King thougnt that, if Mr. Gladstone could succeed in exposing the atrocities of the Neapolitan Govjrnment by writing a pamphlet of so many pa, there was no reason why His Majesty, might not heap twice as much shamte on the English Government and its allies by paying for the publication of a pamphlet double the size of Mr. Gladstone's. The most recent work of this kind is quite a gem in its way, and it is to be regretted that it is too lengthy for quotation entire here, though, in fact, it is more adapted for the colurns of Pundch than for those of The Times. The following extracb, however, will give a tolerable idea of the style, and it will not fail to strike those who remember the docuraent cslled " The Will of Pisicane" that there is a remarkable coincidence of opiuion on the subject of social progress between these very opposite authorities; so true is the proverb that "i extremes meet." The pamphlet in question is published at Brusels, and is entitled Qvestion ItaliePdnePiawston, Cavrour, Mazzini. As far as any one that I have met baa yet discovered, the main object of the author seems to be to show that Mazzini was a tool In the houds of Count Cavour and aord Palmerston in the late attempt on the coast of Italy. They combine the bad qualities of C10esar, Pompey, Crassus, and Brutue, he says, and have leagaed together for the destraction o. Italy. "s Al human sins are not original," boldly eontinmes the exponent of the King of the Two Sicilies - " It is the wickedness of man that has contrived to rula modern society by the snaes of international commerce; it is not an ianate malady in the social oxganizxtion. The promoters of these misdeods, systematically committed, are truly culpable. "' C2esar without money was notbing but an intriguer. The nations of fashions and coal pits without newspapers are only docks in a state of banSrupcy. -Journalism is an acephalous bydra, whose members embrace the globe. These members are composed of alphabetical mercenaries withoun science, without consolence, without law, and withou; country. New levites, they levy a tax on every city b; inducing the citizens to serve, without being aware of it, the commerial Csar, who wishes in his struggle t metailize societies under the direction of one Smith. Bat will the Nulcan outstep Christ! That is the question." And will anybody out of Bedlam outatep this in absurdity? That is another question. The day before yesterday two of the band of escaped convicts which I have already mentionel as having aommitted mueh mischief in the eentral provinces of Piedmont were captured by gendarmes at Vigone, a small town in the province of Pinerola. They made a desperate resistance, and one of them, who is known to be one of the chiefs, tried to seU his life as dearly as possible rather than be made prisoner, but eventually he was secured, after a severe struggle and a few wounds on both sides. The same day two more of the same band were taken in the province of Alba. The Minister of the Interior returned to Turin t-oday, and it is expected the State prosecutions at Genoa will be commenced without further delay. Two advocates, Messrs. Giuriati and Vare, were arrested in Turin the other day on suspicion of having been concerned in the plot of the 29th of June, and were sent yesterday to Genoa for examination before the Court of Inquiry. Some other perquisitions were made both at Turin and. |Genoa lately, but without producing any additiona' evidence apparently, as all the persons subjected to search were sooa afterwards released. SPAIN. The Madrid Gazette of the 6th announces variou3 nominations to bishoprics. The Discusio hai been condemned to a fine of 10,000 reals for publishing an article offensive to the Governwment in the number of the 13th ult. The Queen and King, having gone to Aranjuez to inspect some engineering works, had paid a visit to the convent of that place, of which the famous sister Patrocin;o is the head, and had ordered an image of the Virgin, which is supposed to possess great sanctity, and before which Her Majesty is accustomed to pray when she is in an interesting situation. The object of the visit to Madrid of Prince Vladimir de Raziatinski, first aide-de-camp of the Emperor of Russia, was not known. The Junta of Commerce of Barcelona had sent an address to the Queen, praying her to employ her efforts to promote the cutting through the Isthmus of Suez, as the measure will be greatly advantageous to Spanish commeros. Some more of the persons condemned for participation in the recent insurrection in Andalusia had been pardoned, and among them were two advocates of AnduJar. The miaes of Almadea and Almadenejos had in 1856 produced 14,401 quintals of mercury; those of Riotinto, 5,427 quintals of copper; those of Linaxes, '03 quintals of antimony and 5,S54 of lead; and those of Falset, 439 of antimony. At present Spain has on her coasts not fewer than 64 lighthouses, and they render such great services that the maritime nations, and especially England and France, have expressed their thanks for them. In 1847 there were only 20 in operation.

fOIL;Y-..fARKETli 1 dIT YI.NTELLIG-hNCE. Mouday Even1ng. Ths funda have been extremely dull to-day. They opened at a decline of an eighth, aud subse, C1K.ently experienced a further slight depression: etfirt transactions in Consols for money were at 9Q,O to t, the iarket presenting a general appear' ance os weakness. A sale of about 1OO,OOGi stock ,for delivery, said, it is beLieved erroneously, to have , oen,o account of the East India Comopany, then tamed a faUl to 9i to i, which was the inal quota,tjtalthough at the close there was a little iiiprovyjmeut of tone. For the 9th of September olere were buyers at 90i. The rupture at Con- statinople in favour of the Russian views on I the Principalities and the unrelieved anxiety i about India contributed to the feeling of heaviness. Money was in full but not exceasive demand both in the Stock-Exchange and the dis. count-market at 5; per cent. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 21a&, ]Iuced, 90i to J ' New Three per Cents., 900 to -; and Exchequer-bills, 5s. discount to par. India Stock and India Bonds were both lower, the former closing at 212 to 214, and the latter at 27s. to 20s. discount. The overland despatch from India has been eagerly looked for throughout the day, since, altIough' according to the corresponding arrival of last year it cannot be considered due until Wednerday, the extra efforts likely to be made on thir occasion, and the possibility of itsspeedier transmiion id Constantinople or Cagliari, have led to a belief that many hours msy possibly be saved. n the foreig stock-market amoderate amount of business has been transacted at generally the previous rates. The principal demand was for Turldsh, which closed at a small advance. Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated for the account at 81i; Granada, 229; Mexican, for the account 224; Portuguese, 444 and 45; Spanish Deferrea, for the account, 2i5; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 93, , i, i, 94k, and 93k; ditto Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 984 and 99. In the corn-mrket this morning there was a decline of 2sa The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 9Oc. for money and 67Ã¯Â¿Â½ lOc. for the end of the month, shot. ing in tAoe former case only a fractional decline. About 91,0001. of Australian gold was sold to the Blank to-day. The Australian mail, which was advertised to leave Melbourne on the 15th of June, is now hardly expected until the beginning of next month. The steamer was the European, and if she had left either Sydney or Melbourne at the appointed time ehe would most probably have been telegraphed some days back. The inference, therefore, is that the agent of the company in Australia, who in the previous month had broken the regular order of departure by despatching the Simla out of time, will be found to have changed his plan, and to have detained the European until the 11th of July, which, under ordinary circwmatances, would have been her proper day of sailing. The specie by the America from the United States -day is only 40,0001., but this is owing to Boston having been the port of departure. The Vanderbilt and Atlantic will both be due in the middle of the week, and are likely to bring further sums. The amount overdue from Australia is 681,0001., of -which 406,0001. is on board the Great Britain, now '81 days from Melbourne. The next West India packet may be looked for about Saturday or Monday next, and will probably bring a larger sum than is usually received by the mid-monthly mails, as at the time of the departure of the previous steamer Eer Majesty's ship Alarm was daily expected at Panama with specie from the West Coast of Mexico. Under these circumstances it may be hoped the supply wtill prove fully sufficient to prevent for some time a renewal of the sharp drain from the BSank experienced at the begunning of the month, although the shipments by the next India and C7hina mail are still thought likely to exceed a million. The Afrian mail steamer to-day has brought 11,0001. in gold. Biut for the Government restrictions gold could now be sent from St. Petersburg at a profit of 2 per cent. Persons are alloweed to draw only very small sums, and the exportation therefore is virtually prohibited. Hence the parcels that arrive are altogether insignificant. The Russian people pay heavily for this folly. Probably the remittance of a comparatively maoderate amount would at once restore the exchange to par, but in consequence of that operation being impracticable all the payments to foreigners wrill continue for some time to be made at the disadvantage which the present rate of exchange entails. It is curious to witness this state of affairs after the stories recently circulated that Russia was anxious to turn from military aggression, and to devote all her energies to attain a state of financial and commercial greatness. The dollars brought by the last West India steamer have been sold at 611d., showing an advance of d. per ounce on the price real9ed for those by the preceding packet, although since that time some limited transactions had taken place at 61d. to 6lid. The shares of the Atlantic Telegraph maintain their late recovery, and, after having recently been at 120 discount, were purchased to-day at 30 discount. The market will now fluctuate according to the account transmitted each day of the progress of the vessels. At present the reports with regard to them are delayed by the absence of any telegraphic wire between Valentia Bay and Killarney, but this link is expected to be supplied by the middle of the week. The money-markets of the continental cities remain without alteration. It is only in Hamburg that the rate of discount is higher than in London. The charge there is still 6j per cent. At Paris it is 54, at Amsterdam 4L, and at Brussels 3i. at a meeting of the Iron Screw Collier Company this afternoon, Mr. W. 13uatt, M.P., in the chair, the report and accounts were un ously adopted. It appearing that a loss of 7741. had resulted upon the operations of the half-year ending the 30th of June last, a protracted discussion took place upon the expediency of winding up the undertaking. The advocates of that measure contended it to be impossible for a company, with all the costly machinery of directors, manager, and other officers, to compete successfully with private shipowners, by whom no such expenses were incurred ; and it was remarked that, if the undertaking were now wound up, by the sale of the ships and from the cash in. hand a return of 20s. in the pound might be expected, with the possibility of a surplus, whereas by carrying on operations further losses might ensue and a dissolution take place when the company were in a less favourable poaition. On the other hand, it was argued that great part of the extra expenses for the past year were exceptional, and not likely to oecur again; that the cost of working would be still further reduced from the vessels being withdrawn from the coal trade and employed as ordinary freight ships; and that it was advisable to continue for six months longer, the ships being in good employ and likely to realize a considerable profit. Eventually it was agreed that the subject should be considered at the next half-yearly meeting, and a resolution was carried to that effect. The reports of the trade of the manufacturing towns for the past week show no alteration. The markets generally have been quiet, but firm. At Birmingham the orders for iron from America have not been so large as was expected. In the general business of the port of London during the paat week there has not been much activity. The number of ships reported in ward was' 167. The number cleared outward was 136, including 21 in ballast. The number on the berth for the Australian colonies is 57, being three less than at the last account. Of these five are for Adelaide, four for Geelong, four for Hobart Town, four for Launceston, six for New Zealand, 20 for Port Phillip, three for Portland Bay, 10 for Sydney, and one for Swan River. The following letter must conclude the correspondence regarding the case of Mr. Cowell and the Philadelphia, WVilmington, and Baltimore Railway. It is palpable1 according to all recognized views, that the company acted illegally, and that, if their course were to be confirmed, a new element of danger would be introduced in American investments. They allowed a peraon to act as attorney without the production of any authority, merely upon the representation that he had written to Mtr. Cowell, and they did not even trouble themselves to ascertain if his letters had been received by that g ntleman, or if his acts would be subsequently con- firmed. It is true that Mr. Fisher, who thus axsumed the functions of attorney, and who is believed to be a higbiy ;ewpet?ble and intelligent man of business, may hme been animated solely by a desire to promote the general interests of all concerned, I but that en in no way exonerate the company fromn the ochcequencee of their neglect of those ordinar_y rll.es of procedure upon which every e-areholder is entitled to rely:- "sSir,-All that portion of the English public whioh holds American stocks will look with the greatest interest to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Compan.y, to which you and our correspondent 'C. M.' have ealled attention in your dty articles ot the 3d of last June acd of the 31st nt. The ma'ter is so importaej, and the decision, f nltimately in favour ot the colapany, will so affect the value of Aimerican securities, as held in this country, that I desire your permission to make the poiits which are of public intrest m this case as clear as ossible. Tbislpropose to do by taking the facts from te lega papers connected with the cause as decided against the company oa the 21st February, 1856, and against which deCion the company has appealed. " Mr. Cowell was owner of 400 shares in the stock of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, which he had purchased in 1839 at par. In 14t the company ceased paying dividends, proved to be in great embarrassment, and it appeared that there had been malversation of its funds. In 1848 the company propoed an issue of new stock, amounting to 10 per cent. of the then actual capital, to be taken and paid for by the shareholders at par. Mr. Fisher, one of the directors, subscribed for 40 shares of this stock in Mr. Cowell's name, and the company upon res mnun the payment of dividends on the 1st of October, 1849 applied those due on Mr. Cowell's 400 shaes in payment the par value of the 40 shares for which Mr. Fisher had subscribed in his name by hendink them over to Air. Fisher, who, they plead, was MEr. Co'fel'g attotney. This is the point at which the question becomes of so much imprtsnoe to Eonglish absentee holders oA American securities. Wil the Supreme Court decide that Mr. Fisher was Air. Cow-eli's attorney; that he ws qualifiei to bind Ir. Cowell to take 40 additional shares in the company's stock; that the company was justiedin admitting Mr. Fisheras being Mr. Cowell's attorney, and warranted in paying the accruing dividends on 3Mr. Cowes'3 400 shares to Mr. Fisherz The facts are as follows*- "Mr. Fisher was entirely a stranger to Mr. CowelL It appears that in 1846 Mr. Coweil had requested by letter some friend in Philadelphia to obtain some information for him concerning the condition of the railroad; that this friend had appliad to Mr. Fisher, one of the directors of the railroad; that Mr. Fisher had thereunon written ^ letter to Mr. Cowell through this friend, for which he had, throughX the same frienld, received 3r. Cowell's thanks. u "In 1848, on the 18th of September, Mr. Fisher addresses a letter to Mr. CowelL. On this occasion he felt !himself to be so entirely a atranzer to r. Cowel, and his letter to be of itself so little entitled to attention from Mr. Cowel, that he accompanied it by a letter of voucher and introduction from one of Mr. Cowell's personal friends at IPhiladelphia In this letter of the 18th of September Mr. Eisher opens the proposal of the company regarding the 40 shares, and submlts it to rr. Cowell's consideration, and on t'he lCth of December, 1848, he wrrites to Air. Cowell to inform him that he (Air. Fisher) has subscribed for the 40 shares on his Mr. Cowell's behalf "It does not appear that Mr. Cowell ever replied to or acknowledged the receipt of Mr. Fishers communications, or ever addressed Mr. Fisher in ay way, directly, intermediately, or constructively. "umngthat M r. Cowell did actally receive these communications from Mr. Fisher, he appears to have acted exactly as if no such person existed, and as if no such communications were maee; he seems to have ignored their existenoe and that of Mr. Fisher altogether. " The plea of the company is that this very silenoe of Mr. CoweD invested Mir. Fisher with the quality and authority of attorneyship on Mr. Cowedl's behal. On the Ist of Oc. tober, 1849. only 10 months after the date of Mr. Fisher's letter to Mr. Cowell, the company declares a dividend. $600 thereby become due to Mr. Cowen on his 400 share and this sum it hands over to Mr. Fisher, who receives it as Mr. Cowell's attorney. " I discard all consideration of accessory facts as calen. lated to divert attention from the great and important fact so deeply interesting to English holders of American secarities. The company sent no notice to Mr. Cow-el of this dividend on the 1st of October, 1849, nor of any others until several years after; it did not inquire of him whether Mr. Fisher w:as his agent or not, &c. I discard these and all other similar subordinate facts, The question as brought out for public attention is simply this:-IS M. Fisher invested with the quality of Mr. Cowell's attorney on October 1, 1849,-entitled on that day to saddle Mr. Cowell with the pecuniary and other obligations appertaining to the posses. sion of 40 shares in a railroad company,-entitled to demaad and receive $600 belonging to Mr. Cowell in the compaay's hands on that day, because Mr. Cowell did not think fit to answer Mr. Fisher's letters of September and December, 1848, supposlng he received them ? " It is a fact suficiently formidable to English holders of American securities that the Supreme Court hesitates in its deision on this case. If it should decide that Mr. Cowell's silence invested Mfr. Fisher with his attorneyship no English holder of American securities will be able to protect himself s;ainst the variety of artful contrivances which will be continually resortad to for turning such decision to fraudulent account. "I will onl add that an authentic copy of Mr. Fisher's letterto3fr.CoweD dated the 16th of December, 1848, is now before me. He does not say that he is prepared to take the regponsibility on himself if Mr. Cowell repudiates his at, nor is your correspondent, '0 . hL,' justflied by anything in that letter in sying that if Mr. Cowell had thought proper to announce his repudiation he f(Mr. Fisher) would have been ready totaketle subscription to his own account. On the contary, you will ace by the copy which I enclof that 3Yr. Fisher coumpLains that if Mr. Cowed shall repudiate his act he shedlos10e $1l,000, insted of Mir. Cowved Of x y

Sir F. pRl Y said, he would then proceed with the thirdc branch of the eige, ben g with Sir Gilbert of Grafton. Substantlm y soeal:ng, there. w* e but two points thade in this part of the pedigree. The first point was the allegation that there were other sons of Sir John of Albrigh. ton besides Sir John, by hi firs' masiae. There was no evidence before their lordsbips with respct to those two sons except an oblterat inscription upon atombstohe,which could not be Made out. Sir Jobh in his wil merely mentioned his son Joha by his firt wife, and his two sons, Gilbert and Johnow byed hisswod &eaother pIt had been sggesd that John, thlegrandson of thn, of Alb hton, had a third son, Gilbert but George, the 9th Mel ade noem entin Of any suc ti person, altho ad to his two other nephews, John, the Theth er andeorgee grt family settlement of the Duk e hr y in 1700 was eni y wrong if the re e a l gescdatof Sir John of Albri ton by his fir iage exet John of Longford, an Gilbert of Batc ae hs su e m extnct in Bertram, the last e Hesnwcm to the the second line from Sir John of o lbrighton by his second Marriage. This he must divideittw parts In the firs plaeA, he must trace thedsenat of Sir John of mucrighenu Cbarles, the Chanceor. Three points made been meade by hs learne r t other side.' In the first ploce doubts had been thrown upon the legitimacy of John of Salwaxp then the descent of W'iam the bshop from Wilism of Whittington was contested; and thirdly, the descent of Charles from the bishop. The only evidence to lead their lordsh-p totsupposethat John ofSwarp was Illegitiatep was an eraeed "1" plamed at the endof his name in h pedigree produced by the other side. Oa the part of ,ord Talbot teveral inquisitions and wil hao d been produced, in which John was mnentioned as the yongest son of Sir John of fabrighton by his Wseond ofW and he biad iaherie estates eft to hirs under that description. He now prnoeedend to the other points, and he boegged to ca their lordsiap' attention to the effects of his eeablishing them in favour of the claima Ifut. lhe iads them out to their lordshipe satisactioin he had established an earl of Shrewsbury, enid it. would be for the other side to produce another claimant withl a bettercaim. He had isetened with surprios to the suggestion of the other side that the bishop was not the son of Wialiam of W(Ldttnmto The first piece of evidenoe wih respect to the biChaao'r deent from Willim of Whittingtof was cotained in t. e xauch abused book of the Benefactors The pigrewas: made by the h and of the brother of ill the Whltwtingo ton, who was srKeted tohave marri ed th, "ivloio n h a son Wiliam. In the will of a du stereo fWalsie, of Wthitt tington certain legaies were left t her brother William and to his son Willoam, and to his daughter, Mrs. Catherine Lyttleton. That Mrs. Lyttletx subsequaently married the Bishop of Exeter, who becme by that marr e and Who was celaed the brother-in-law of W im t bishop. Wouldbthe twobisps have been guilty of the public he of so amint themselves if theythad not been thus related o 'Would Wailiamfthe bishop have erecteda monument under the eyes of his whole family to William of Whittingaon as his father if there had been no truth in that saltement h His learned friend tlpdn tho other side ha at once disposed of this inscription acknowledged wo have been written by the bsop, by alg ItRe am IlbTolbte falsehood. He trlst that their lordhp wouldCaot credit such a siuggesion, and wouldi not believe that a perso 'who had been raied to his high positionwouldtha'er bee gulty of ce h ancof f her had done so, his aider, and abettor was his son Charles, the ord Chancllor, of whom a noble lord (Lord Camp. bell) then present had said, he found this Chancellor the only one without an enemy, without a detracokr, without any one to cavil. at any part of his cbAracoter, conduct, or abIlnty; and this was the peton their lordshipe were asked to consider a conspirator and a forger, in the expectation of aggrandizing a remote descondant. Ihe surbmitted that, unid all the documents produced wer false, or that there were twot sets of persons a being the same names and the same relations to each other or the. Bishtop was tlhe on of William of Whittington. lie now came to the third and last point Madl b 's learned friends upon the other side, which rea tedto e question of the is ttimacy of Charles Talbot, afterwards Lord Oechanceor. ha the firsf neace he admitted that he was utterly unable to find any register of the marriage of the bishop, hut the register at Chip. ping Norton of tho baptism of Charles had been laid before their lordshipe in 'which 'he was described as the son of Mr. Wiliam TsaidL The other side had suggitted that if Charles ha been legitimate he would have been descrbed as the son of the LPev. Wlliam Talbot, or of'William Talbotd clerk. The mnother of Cathariae, the bishop's wife, lived at' ipping Norton, audit was very likely that a lady would return to her mother's house to be confined of her first child. Agaiust, the smestion of the other side were to be tet the entry of Charles's admission in the books of the LOr Temple, which was to the effwet that he was the eldest son of the Rev. William Talbot; and also the writ by which Charles Talhot was created baron, in which it was recited that he was son and heir of William, Bishop of Saitsbury and further, the fact tht he wau a party to the deed of settlement of 1718, to which all the members of the great Talbot family were parties. If their lordahips were satisfied that there were no reasonable doubts as to the legitimacy of John of Salwar, the relationship of paternity between 'William of Whittingtn and the Bishop of Sa6lisbury, and the legitimacy of Charles, this one great fact was esta- blshd,that Earl Talbot, the claimant, was lieally descaded from the first Earl of Shrowsbury, and was entitled to their lordships judgmaent ia his favour, unless some nearer heir could be proved to exist. Lord CAiJI'PF.LL said that it was the claimant's duty to give reasonable evidence that no nearer heir existed. It was not essentially necessary that direct evidence as to the deaths of those, persons should boe' given ; but there must be reaonable evidence to conclude that no nearer heir existed, Sir F, KiELLY said, he enatirely assented to that proposition. The LORDn Cn"cEL,LoEp_f those points are decided In your favour you have established. that there is an Earl of Shrewsbury. The AxToRB Y-GXNEUAL here made his ap~pearance and stated that his duties elsewhere pevented huin from Imin able to attend at their lordshipe' bar during the remainder of the argmments in this case, He therefo-re befed their lordahips to grant hlm until next Friday to enlable him to read over the shorthanid writer's notes of the argumenits. Lord CA1MPBELL said, be was aware from experience of the embarrassments of the Attorney-General's position, and he wa s sr the House wouild unanimously accede to his reenee.- The other lords havIng assented, the Attorney-Goneral withdrew. Sir F. KELLY then sad, that he had showrn by the evideue adduced that Gilbert, said to be a nephew of Sir John of Lacooli amd therefore of an elder branch than Lord Talbot, was not a nephew of Sir John of Lacok, hut that, on the contra, he was descended from a 'ardor branch to Sir WLilliam Of Whittington and thereiore did not interfere with te claimant's title. With regard to the five sons of Sherrington of Rudge, who were suggested to have h ssue, no mention, of sugh Issue had been made by the- Duke of Shrewbary ici his settlement of .1700, although such issue would have been entitled to the title In the event of the death of Sir John of lAcok, without issue, which really happened, and In the death of George of B3atchcoate, who was then a boy, without issue, Tihe Duke of Shewbau and the Earl of ussex, who had marrie a female relatiVe of the famil stated upon oath that the persns named in the deed ofsettlement were the neares in the line of succession, and yet thmy had not mentioned any dcendants of Sherrington except ir.

The onIY one out of the 16 persons added by the other side to Uor Talbota's edgree who had been proved to have existedl was a Shorringtu the son of Thomas, a son of Sherrington of Budge, and that persn hail not been heard of since 1684, Mr. Se2jeant Bmrps sad, he believed he should he able to produce the mArriage register of the marrige of t4A kJier-:. zigton.

There were n1 prisoners Mr. CROAsY shortly charged the grand jury. John Smith, John Warren, smd Thomas Bennett, three labouriug men, were indicted fgr having stolen a quantity of lead, the property of the Great Northern Railway Com. pany. Mr. Cooper appeared for the prosecution; Mfr. Tayler appeared for Smith, who pleadfA " Guilty." On the 17th of July the prisoner Smith was stopped as he was leaving the company's premises in York-road by a constable, who noticed something bulky about his person and on being searched pieces of lead weighing about 701b were found upon him. Bennett and Warren were waiting for him at a neighbouring beershop, and another constble apprehended them. Bennaett acknowledged having cut the lead wilth a saf whEich wras pronided by the other prisoners, and Warren, neffect, acknowledged h is complicity in the theft. Smith was selected to carry the plunder off the pre- The jury found Bennett And Warren Guilty. Mr. Cnsasy sentenced Bennett, who had been before convicted, to three year penal servitude; Smith to six months, and Warren to 10 months' hard labour. James Birch, 18, was indicted for having stolen a sovereign the money of James DrXver. Mr. Orridge prosecuted; Mr. Metcalfe defeaded the pri. soner. The prosecutor and the prisoner were iourneymen bakers, and ocoupied one sleeping apartment. The prosecutor had 20 sovereigns in a bag in his box, and for some reason! he marked two, aud placed them on the top of the others, mnd put the bag in the box, the key of which he hange on a nail by the side of the. bed. The prisoner subsequently went to the room, and the prosecutor stated ia his evidence that, on examining the bag afterwards, he missed one of the muarked sovereigns, which was found in ffhe pocket of a pair of trousers belonging to the prisoner which were hanging on the bedraiL noliceman was sent for, and, when accused, the prisoner said there was a, sovereign in his trouserspocket, but itwas his own. The prosecuior swore to the com by two marks he had put upon It. In cross-examination he stated that he had not shown thd 20 sovereigns to any one, nor had he brought the other marked one to the court. He had never quarrelled with the pr}enner, mid the latter had never, to his knowledge, com. plained to his wasterabout him. 'Mr. MnrCAME sauggested that at least the case was one of great doubt and saspicion as far as the prosecutor was conceined, and said that the prisoner, if he had really stolen the sovereign, must have been infinitely worse than an Idiot to have left it in his trousers pocket close by the proseicutar's box, wrhen he had an ample opportunity to get rid The jury, after a short consultation, found the prisoner Guilty. The prisoner said that was wrong; he was not guilty, Sentence was deferred, ia order that evidence as to character MDigt be produced. James Coombes, 21, was indicted for stealing a silver watch and gold chain, the property of Thomas Lucas, from hr. ent prosecuted. This was a daring street robbery. The prosecutor, an elderly man, was paving the end of George-street, Whitechapel, when he was attacked by the prisoner, who laid hold of his watch, broke it from the chain, and ran off. The prosecutor gave a description of him to the police, ipon wvhich he ws aporehend=d, and the maoment the prosedctor saw him he pofnited him out as the man. He was a bold, resolute-looking fellow. The jury found him Guilty. He had been before convicted. Mr. CRnAsY sentenced him to four years' penal servitude. James Smith, 21, Henry Hrris, 23, and John Ellis, 19, were indicted for stesaling a silver watch, &c., the property of James Beavan. They pleaded " Guilty," and were sentenced to 18 months' hard labour each, There were three indiotments against them.

Reynolds was sentenced to foux inontha Bard labour. Sanuel Robinson ws indicted for stealing a workbox, the property of Ann Co4tes, in her dwelling-house. The prosecutrix lived at No. 1, Bedbury-place, Juddstreet, and one dav, she having left her door for a minute, the prisoner ran into the parlour and stole a workbox, that being the nearest artilel he could lay hands npon.

Mr. Bright came not before them with apologies-with any retractation-with any expresdon of sorrow for what he had done-or with any promise df amendment; he stood forward saying that as he had been the defender of his country's interests and rlghts, the friend of the workdig classes, an thesupporter of good Islatiod of every ind,.so he would continue to be, honestly ve. cating what he beleved to be just, whether his views were in unisn with or oppsed to the prevailing opinions of thQ hour.

A NEW Z WAAPOV OF WAR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES. Sir,-Wben the nation waz excited during the Caffre war Iaddressed, on the 3d of January, 1l51, a letter to The TimesF which, leading the British press, zendered Infinite rvoCe to the cotutry by forcing the Govemment to arm our troops with an improved firelock. Though it may be a matter of dispute how the prewent state of India has arisen, thiiem a be no doubt of it being the duty of every one at the fse#enr moment not only to endeavour to improve mAtters there -but to inflict penishment (in the words of your leading article of the 6th of August),- ' "'On those -merciless fiends who have treated our countrymen, and stil,l wroe oar countzywomen And their children, in such a manner that evea men can scarcely hint to each other In whipers the awful details? aI d that " these Indian,ruffians must be made to feel the conseunoes to themselves of the wrath which they have .provokedr;'" andthat" thoeuropenn officers and wldlers now employed In the suppresion o* tis military mutiny mlay looc for the unhesita;ting. support of their countrymen, howvever atern my be the meseures wihich they mlay think2 prperto employ. Wishing to be useful to those in India, I enclose to you a copy. of a letter wvhich I on the 27th of June addressed to an infiuentialmember of Her Majesty's Government, which posibly was never read by him, but 'which he assiredly will read if it be published in The Times. Since I wrote that letter I have studied with attention the subject-matter of it, and I am convinocd that this terrible weapon of war may be advantageously used in India and China, anda the force before Delhi had been so provided no sorties could have taken Dlade CHArL-ES STAW. Aug-.7 "'CoPY OF A Im'rmi To THE RIGHT Eox. EARL- Lo"woN. "tMAy LOAd-A few days before pewc with Russia was declared your Lordship bad the kindness to grant to* me a persona iuterviesw, when I pointed out a simple method by which onr troops before Sebastopol might be so arranged a to rendersurprise impossible, and that there would be -nonecessAty for the regiments 'turning out' two hours before daybreak, which is the great cause of sicles in any aTmy in the field. I refer your Lorldship to my letter, Tublihe in Xth Times on the 3d of January, .1851, i whi&n I then and thefe pointed out the power of the Wini6 rfife, and proved the necessity of suchi firearm being used in the Caffre war. Such letter was the commyencement of the agitation for armng all the Brltish army with that firelock, which did such good service at AIma, Inkermun, nd SebastopoL Confident that your Lordship will lsten to any p lan, even however impracti. cable it may at first aPear, Iconsider it a duty to reuest of you, as a member of Her Majesty's Goveriment, to place the following offer before Her Majesty's Ministers I have attended to the details of the Chins6e war, and have re. marked the danger to which our small men of war, boats, and mereantile marine have been and may be exposed from the overpowering number of the enemy in their war junks. By The Times of yesterda.y have -seen the mutinies of the Sepoys, and I am aWEre how much more numerous they are than the British troops in Indisa I now offer to the British Government a plan, simple, efficaco2s, and inexpensive, by, which any attack of war junks or pirates may be repulsed. That board. ng is rendered 'mpraeticable, as the attackin party must be partaly or totally disabled, and this wth i9ttlye or no loss to thoseacting in defence. Butt, if an attackdng party be 'Provided 'withL thisa Invention, they, with little or nio Iors can board any ship with the almost certainty of guocess. That Iff50 or 100 B3ritish trops, in any house or outwork, be provided with such invention, no number of an attacking party, if unprovided with artillery, can sucoeed in taking such house or outwork; that no troops or armed prties can advance through streets if one or two houss be BUPppi with this invention; thAt say habicade, through tifs Invention, can be oade- impregnable. I could go on ad infinitum showing the terrible power of this inventiou in attak and defenoe, but more eÃ¯Â¿Â½cially the latter, if this -weapon of war be not unnecesarl y exposed to round ahot or musketry, shelter from which] is easily accomplished. 'f the gunboats lately despatched to China were so pro. vided, they could easily carry all before them, and with ittle or no loss to themselves If the Ruoslans had known of this invention which I now offer to the Britis Government, the Malakhoff could not have been taken. A body of 1,W0 men tdrairably adatted for the work could be raised in a week, and 200 of tbese instruments of destruction, with requisite ammunition, could be shipped in less than a fortnight. I am ready to make this invenution kn^own to the British Government on their agseing to pay - on y showing to a person authorzed by them that the lan or the principles of the plan are certain of success; "t if I fail to show the praticability of the plan, and that the principles I discover are not well founded, the Govern. ment are not to pay one farthing; but if Iprove that I am correct in the prinoiples and the practicability of the plans, then the British Government, in addition to the payment of the above sum of Ã¯Â¿Â½- are bound topay during the next three years Ã¯Â¿Â½- ; on each oocasion when suc4lan, In aitack or defence, is used with succm the persoDal interview with your Lordship above referred to, aceordin to your Suggetio I reuetqd a ronal iterview with the MinisterofWargO e .is request id :Panne reinsed, but requirea. from me my $aSu in writing.
