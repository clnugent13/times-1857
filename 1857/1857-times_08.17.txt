INDIrA PBVENUES AND PINANCEs [From the Bgco2osni4L] 6W&7Ver much in mere point of form fAnd for the sake of Qultvenience in keeping accounts, an) dettrmining from What sources coertain liabilitiee are to be met, it is necessary to maintain a olear distinttiott between Imperial and Indian finances, yet it is impossible not to admit that when the affairs of our Eastern po6sessions amssme the gravity and urgency 'which they do at this time we mnst be prepared to sink all rinor and divieional questions, and to feel that all our resources must be disposable, so far as may be required, in order to save so important a portion of the empire. But while we are prepared to make any sacrifices which so great an object deserves, it is necessary that we should avoid all vagne 1imi tand apprehension, which, especially in a financai poit of view, could only aggravate the difficulty, and look to our relations with India, its resources and liabilities in a calm and temperate manner. In many quarters there has for some time past been a disposition to disparage the financial position of India, and to exaggerate the temporary difficulties to which it has been exposed; and the influences i roduced upon the public mind by the vague impressions thus circulated have recently produced a powerful effect upon our market for public securities in connexion with the calamity which has suddenly fallen upon India. It is nevertheless a fact which may teach us an important lesson at the present crisis that throughout all the difficulties to which from time to time the Government of India has been exposed in gaining and maintaining the vast territories under its rule it has never been a burden directly upon the finances of England. At the same time, and especi1lly since the passing of the Act of 1834, it may fairly be admitted that the view taken by Sir Robert Peel in his budget speech of 1842, in considenag the finances of India as closely a8eociated with those of England, and, in the case of great urgency, as even identical, cannot be entirely ignored. The real question, however, which in the interests both of England and India 'we have now carefully to consider, and npon wbhich wo are called upon to arrive at a fair and dispassionate judgment, is the means which India possesses independent of this country to support the great efforts which undoubtedly must be made in order to zestore tranqulity. This question, in order to be satisfactorily determined, must be considered in all Its bearings and in relation to the entire soUrces of the income of India and its liabilities. In the first place, then, we would consider from the most recent and authentic documents what are the ordinary sources of Inditn revenue. According to the necounts made up for the year 1855.56, the gross revenue collected in India, exclusive of repayments and drawbacks, amonntod to 28,812,0971., and was derived from the following sources £ Land revenuo 17.817,299 customs .1,934,906 St .2,485,389 Opium ..871,27 rost-Onice . . .. . . . 2195045 staomps. 5049 Other recelpt. 979,902 Total revenue .. .. .. 25812097 Iunon this sumn of 28,812,0971., the cost of collection, in. cluding, howvever, allowvances and assignments payable chiedy out of the land revenues, in accordance w;ith treaties and other engagements, amounting to 1,244,4981., was no less than 6, 647501., under the followFing heads COST or CoLLcrTosN.

If, however, we make allowance for the amount expended on public works, 'whicb must be regarded more in the light of an investmeut, the consequence of which will be to improve the chief source of income (the land revenue), rather than as an expenditure on the part of the Govern. Mnent- then, in place of a deficiency, there would be a surplus of nearly a million of income over expenditure. But with regard toso lrge an income it is important- to consider the sources from which it is derived. Out of the receipts of 22,147,3471. uo less than 13,302,1401. is derived frons the rents of land, 1,818,2971. from Custons' duties collected almost exclusively at the capitals of the three presidencies, 1,911,1071. from the saltmonopoly, 3.714,355!. from the sale of opium, and 473,3711. from stamps, making from these five sources no less than 21,219,2GW. So far as any irsecurity of the ordinary revenues of India, in consequence of the mutiny in the Bengal army, in coneorned, it m.ay bo said to be strictly confined to some portions of the NorthW est Provices, and itis therefore important to examtine what proportion of the whole is collected in those districts. In the year 185) 5G the collectious in those provinces, not including the Punjab, were as follows: RInSvNUE Os' Nostvu'WFaT PROVINCES. Grew. Net. X £ xand revenue s0 o;e ..8 4.074,402 e1,,t.ns .. .. .67, 3 :: S763 o57,5 Salt . .. .. . . 5 .% 411 678 p.oat Mree.. . 81 3so 9 396ew LIa)p. . . . .. 152,1'3 . 14233 Other sources . 1 .09 . 30, 369 Tot3i .. .. .. 65535 844 4,TsT.5il There are two most important considerations whioh prcsent themnselves at first sight in relation to these socounts. and which appear essentialy to affect the security of the fiLances of India. 1, That so large a portion of the whole is derived from a source so secure, so permanent, aud so weU defined as the rents of land; and 2, Thatof all the other sources of income, so large a proportion is co>llected in those parts of India where British rale is most secure. In the N,rth-West Provinces, where alone up to this time the mutiny exists, it will be observed that of a net revenue of 4,786,541. no less than 4,074,4021. consists of the rent of land; and it is a most important fact in relaticn to this that of lateyears the whole of these revenues have been resettled upon termis at once advantageous and satisfactory to the culivator of the snil. Whatever, therefore, may be the interruption, and it is not lEkely to be considerable in the collection of this revenue at the ordinary period when due, there is every certainty that at no remote time the arrears will be wollected, and that no pormanent loEs is therefore likely to be incurred from this source. It is an undoubted source of strength to the fnances of India that the revenue Is derived from so few, hut such wellascertained and simple sources, and that the main portion is obtained not in the form of taxes, strictly speaking, but in the shape of payment for the beneficial occupation of land. p But the next point that we have to consider is what are the permaneut charges for which the revenues of India are liahle F:rst, there is the capital stock of the old East India Company, which originally stood at t,0O,000., but which is redeemable under the Act of 1834 only by a pay. ILA.nt of 12,00,000Q . For this stock the revenues of India are chargeablo with the sum of 632,0001. a year. Next, there is the houie bond debt, amountingr to 3,894,4001., bearing interest of 4 per cent, and chargeable upon the Inidian revenues under the same Act. And last, there is the debt in India, which in every shape amomusts to 50,493.3601. upon whioh interest is payable to the amount of 2,140,577?. It is, however, necessary to reniark with regard to the first of these liabilities, viz., the stock of the old East India Cumpany, that the Act of 1834 provided for the deposit from the assets of the mercantile branch of the Company, then about to be abolished, with the Commissioners of the National Debt of a saim of 2 000 O000, to accumulate at compound interest until it reacbed' 12,00,0001., by way of guarantee to the proprietors of East India Stock. According; to an account whch has been laid before Parliament, this depoits money has already accumulated in the hands of the Cosmmssioners of the National Debt to a sum of 4,282,941., w;hich, of course, must he regarded as an asset in diminution of the iabilities of the East India Coam. pany, as at present constituted, in respect to the original capital stoc With this explanation the entire capital debt for which the revenues of India are liable may be thus stated CAPITAL Dray. 1.

If we con are this condition of the inoome of India with that of die chief Earopean States, and particularly with our own, the comparison must be considered as extremely favourable to India. The annisal revenues of the United Kingdom rmay be said to be in round figures 60,000,0001 a'year :-oiir debt amonnts to about 7S0,U00,C, , and the annual charge to 28,000,0001. O,ir debt therefore represents a sum about 12 times greater than our anual revenue, wzhile the annual ebarge is eqnal to a sum nearly one-hoif of our incOme. In India, on the contrary, the whole debt amounlts to a sum less thsu three times tho amDount of the revenue, and the annual charge is less than one-seventh of the incomue- Looking, thei, to the actual re-sources of the Indian Govecnment In relation s its liabilities, there is not, we believe, a single Europeaa Government with so smnall a pottion of ito actua4 ,inueo:n tngaged iVi tlue So l4rity of its obligations.
TE LIATZ STORMS. Abott 2 o'clock on Friday morning last the electric fluid struck a portion of tha goods shed, at the Bricklayers' Arrms statidn of the South-Basute Railway, and caused so severe a coacussion that the p6rters who were unloading the train containing fruit for the metropolitau markets instantly iurnmped off the platform in a state of the greatest terror. The chief officers on duty, Mr. Biggs and Mr. Wells, exa,. mnined the iron roof, and immediattly ordered a policeman to prevent aU personas from walking under it. This order fortanately was strictlyobeyed, as about two hours afterwards a ption of the roof, about 350 feet in length, together with the massive girders and Iron pillars, feU with a tremendous crash, the fragments completely covering 25 waggons. Notice of the occurrence was forthwith given to the general manager, Mr. Asheroft, by Mr. Noden, the goods manager, who had just returned from the continent, and a body of 100 labourers was immediately employed to remove the fallen materials. In consequence of the terrific storra on Friday evening this operation was considerably delayed. In the course of Saturday, however, the wreck was completely cleared away. No damage occurred, except the loss of the shed, nor were the trucks seriously injured. Had It not been for the precautions taken by the officers on duty, in all probability a serious losg of life would have occurred, there eing on an averae about 50 men continually at work on the plattorm. Immediately the roof feU in Mr. Noden ordered the I4uster-roll to be called, and no one was found missing. Althqsagh the accident caused serious inconvenience the good, train left the station at their appointed times, and the mnarb t trains arrived on the folowing (Saturday) morning, and Weir contents were despatched to their destination as 1susa1 This is the fonrth occasion on which a portion of the orginal roof of the Bricklayers Arms station has fallen within the last 12 years. In the coanty of Essex the market-gaTdeners' grounds were flooded to an Alarming extent, and many low-lying parts were immndated by the heavy rains which feU on Friday and Saturday evenings. Several lofty trees were struck by the lightning, and the roofs of many houses were severely damaged by the electric fluid. In the mnall villages of Epping, Chlgwell, Maiden, Barking, Dagenham, or Brentwood, ornchurch, Lea, Ongar, Romford, Stratford, Walthamntow, and Woodford the farmers have been geat sufferers, and their crops have been damaged. Tiane ,C.chtr lie of the lr-e Counties Railway in various parts presented an unusual and singular appearance, more partionlarly at B iry St. Edmund's, Norwich, Yarmouth, and Lowestoft. The usual expursion trains on the Cambridge and Colchester lines were ratber delayed by the violence of the storm, but no serious acoident occurred. In,f be suburban districts of EHacktney, fmerton, Old Ford,Eingsland, Bow, Haggerstone, Dalston, Shacklewellgreen, 2toke NZewingeon, and other eastern parts of the metropolis, the effects of the storm were more severely felt by the owners of property, whlo have suffered by the Theresidence of Mr. Nicholls, the baUder, of No. 25 Strathmore-tetrace, Back-road, St. Paul's, Shadwell, was struck by lghtning. A large stone chimney was forced from the brickwork of the roof, ad carried by a sudden gust of wind across the street into the back premnises of an opposite neighbour, by which the roof of an outhouse was partially destroyed, but no personal iun'ry was sustained by the inmates. The roos of several buiUdings in the same neighbourhood were also similarly damaged. At half-past 11 o'clock oh Friday there was a terrific discharge of lihtning, by whicb the south-eas3t pinnadle of St. Michael's Church,Stm ford. was initantaneously struck down. The Church of St. Micbael is a modern structure, ereoted in 1832. It is situate in the centre of the towa. The southeast pinnacle, which received the electric fluid, was Coinposed of a mass of masonry, weighing about 15 cast.; the iron clamps or tics by which the work was bound together, aerved as partial conductors. At every break in their arrangement a series of diampture disebarges of the electric fluid took place in lateral directions, driving out large masses of the stonework, spreading them over the roof of the nave and. churchyard,doing considerable damageto theroofig and tombstones. The effect of the fluid when it reaohed the base of the pinnacle, from not meeting with a ready conducting niedium, was to uplift the whole mass, impartlng to I it at the same time a kind of circular motion to the soathI ward, the apex of the pinnacle falling in a line with its original base, and the base hasing traversed about tie eighth part of the circle, fell into the roof of the tower. Imnmediataly at the base of the pinnacle there is a threeinch iron spout or tube erected to convey the water from the tower- roof. This iron tube the electric fluid entered, and fiudiug through it an unopposed channel, passed down the tower, and finally into the earth, without doing more dlamage, The iron tube or spouting in this instance, and by miere accident, acted the part of a lightning oonductor, and served to protect the other parts of the tower from most serious injuy, if not entire destruction. On Fr"day the town of tetford was inundated with water to an extent that has had no pirallel for the last 62 years. In ast least half-a-dozen places the water rose above the basement floors of the houses, and in Spring-gardens and the loealtty near the railway station persons were taken out of their h--uses in boats. The deluge swept quite through the market-place, which is in the centre of the town, and even invaded the churchyard, wbich is still higher up. Froem Betford to Bawtry, along the course of the Idle, and on both sides of the Great Northern Railway, the lands were more or less submerged, and all kinds of crops. whvat, bailey, oats, beans, turnips, and potatoes, were saturated, not ouly the lowlands being flooded, but the high| lends also, to an extent unknown before. At Itawtry all the flat coantry in the direction of the Trant; was like an in.mense lake. At Doncaster the river Don overflowed it, banks, and covered the adjacent lands with water. A bank erected on the north side of the stream by the River Dan -red South York;hiro Railway Compuay some years ao i was ct on Saturday evening by a party of men, mosily marivers and inhabitants of that part of the town which is expoted to the severest effects of the Don floods. Dnring the whole of Saturday quantities of wheat, oats, hay, &o., were carried down the river, having been swept out of the fields where harvest operations have been arrested by the I.to heavy rains. At Meaborough, a few miles above Doncaster, the flood is the highest recorded, and several head of cat'le have been lost. A great fall of earth was caused by the rain at Scar. borough, on the eastern face of the Castle-hill. A semnicircular piece of about half an acre has gone sheer down, leavingaprecipitoua fare from tbe top to the bottom, a depth of well nigh 200 feet. The quantity of earth and rock wvhich 1-as fallen cannot belese than a hundred thousand tons in weight, and is probably much miore. There was a large cavern there, which was entered from the Castle. yard, at no great depth below its surface. It was regarded as a curiosity bF the people of Scarborough, and when the 28tb4 Regiment had an encarmpment in the Castle-yard three v ears sa the officers sometimes had their mess in the cavern. T dt ru h g banI has perished along with the portion of the eliff which his fallen, and may have been the cause of this fall, by filling with a weight of water beyond the tenacity of the cliffto resist. Manchester and its neighbourhood were visited with a Iseries of heavy tbunderstorms on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday mornuing, resulting in the flooding of the rivers to a height which has .ot been known for many years and a I serious loss of life and property. Heavy rains had faUlen on the carlier days of the week, but the first thunderstorm was l on Thursday even.ng, when the lig htning was extremely vivid, coining in triple flashes, and the rain descended in torrents. During Thursday night and up to 10 o'clock on Friday morning there was a succession of very heavy showers, and the rivers Irwell, Irk, and MIedlock were sw ollen during the whole of the day. The most serioius sterl, bowever, w;as rce which commenced about 10 o'elock on Friday night and lasted until 2 o'clock on Saturday mornmng. The flashes of lightning and peals of thunder followed each other with unusual rapidity, and the deluge of rain that came down converted the streets into pools of water. The rivers had risen above the level of their deep channels, and in many pIaces were ovErfloWing their banks. Many people say them streams have not been so high for 30 years past The destruction of life and property by the floods was ,ery imperfectly known up to Saturday night. A man waq drowned in the Irwell, near theVictoria.-bridge, and several lives are said to hare been lost at Blue-pit; by the burstinglof the reservoir, and higher up the streams it was reported that lives had been lost, including two boys named Robinson and Fox, drowned at Ashton-under-Lyne. Thedestructiou of property has been very great in Manchester alone, caused chiefly by the overflow of the Medlock. We have heard it variously estimated at 40,0001 to 50,0001. Among tlue principal buildings flooded were the cotton mis of Messrs. J. and W. Belhouee, Messrs. Birley and Co., Aldermnan Barnes, Messrs. Hilton and.Co. (Holt-town), Mr. Jones (Mount-strect), and the Hanover-mill. The mest serious loss among these cases will probably bave aecrued to Messrs. W. and J. Bellhouse. In their mill the watter is said to have risen 3 feet 0 inches above the level it attained iu the flood of last August. The cotton-mill of Mezsrs. Mxrsdes, at Ancoat-bridge, was flooded to the depth of .ine feet, and tLe night watchman on duty had a narrow escape. Hanover cotton-mUll, at Buxton-street, were flooded to a depth of 17 feet in the boiler-house, and of 5 feet in the tlhrostle-roor,. At Mr. Thomas Chester's brewery, Stovestreet, 38 pockets of hops were iunmereed, 37 puneheons of ale destroyed, aid a portion of the building damaged. The loss is estimated at about 7'-)1. At some cottages in this street not only the cellars but fixst story rooms were under water, the Ilood entering the bedrooms. Mr. Stone, of the Bridge Iiin, had his stables flooded, and one of his horses was drowned. Mr. Crabtree, dyer, also lgt a horse In a slniiar way. Anmong others who suffered serious damage in the same neighbourhood are Messr Teonat and Co., nannufacturing cbymists; Mr. Simrister, confectioner: Mr. Arnold, grcer ; Mr. Ridings, innkeeper (Itoyal Oak) - Messrs. T. Cunliffe and Sons printers - Heswrs. W. Andrews and Co., dresLers and dyers; IMessrs. 5Wren and H.K-Xinson, engineers; Messrs. Newton and Co., dyers: Mr. James Donaldson, dyer; Mr. W. Brigham, iron works; Mzr. J. Kearney, AMessrs. J. P. Westhead and Co., Mr. S. Pvtts, Mr. Mlrsland, spinner; and Messrs. Ramsey and Co. On the Irwell the river had inundated the works of Messrs. Lockett, Sons, and Leake, engravers; of Mr. Uoic, nuaobine maker; Mr. Harding, cotton-spinner; and Mr. Do Bergue, machine maker. Tne total rise in the flwell, abovu tre uisual water level, was about 15 feet. It is feared that considern.ble losses have been sustained up the stream, as large qnantities of timber, a cow, pigs, and some househuld furnitnre, were Feen fl..ating down the river. The rivers Etherow and Mersey, from Dinting to Stockport, and down in the agricultural portions of Cheshire, were much flooded, aind crops of corn and other produce on the banks of the MIaersev will have suffered mueb dama,-e. 'lbe house of Mrs. Ovy, 17, Clarence-street, Chorlton. upon-Medliek, was struck ly lightning on Friday night, saidsetonfire, but the property was saved withtriflig a lktter from Stowe, in Linoolnshire, states tbat on Thursday, during a tbn:der storm, stacks of corn were set on fire bv the lightnir,g; anDd in one instarce a field of staDding corn was also set on fre by lightning and de3troyVEd. Phe Weat Rliding of Yorkshire was visited on Friday night wiith a terr:fic storm of thunder and lightning, causileg great de4truction to property. and which unhappily did not terrninate without loss of life. A house at rlaey, neatly opp site to the railway station, was comP.llefy washed away by the flood, and at Saddle Weitb a grebt portivas ef the f0ffing-yAtth coundoted with the canal was wvhed awray. The Standedge Tunnel, the property of the London and North-Western Railway Company, which is nearly thIree mile in lengtb, was for Jome time three feet deep in water, causing great delay to the mnaU train to Mancheater and Crew's. At Marsden two bridges, one built of iron and the other of wood, were destroyed, as also a great number of cattle; and much damage vas done to the mills, the lower stories of some being compiletely filled with wvater. At MiUneabridge, Dear Huddersfield, several mills and houses were flooded, and a bridge over tho river was torn up to the foundation, and not a vestige of it now remains. Messrs Walker and Sons, dyers, had their premnises deluged by the overflowing of the canal, and 150 pieces of valuable mohair cloths were swept away, and great damage also done to the prernises and works, estimated at upwards of 1,0001, The premises of Mr. W. Arn,old, boiler maker, were also completely inundated and much damage done, large iron boiler flues, weighing 30 cwt., being carried away. he foundation of the gasometer was completely twisted round by the force of the current. The damage at these works vill be several hundred pounds. Several cot. tages, too, in the neighbourhood were so filled with water that the inmateswere nearly swimming in their be;s, and on the doors being opened their goods were washed away. At Holmfirth the inhabitants, or many of them at least, passed the night in thestreets, having learnt suoh a lesson in 1852 that they were afraid to go to bed. The damage done there, however, is comparatively small. A portion of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, between Brockholes and Eonley, was rendered impassable, and many mills in the Holme valley were flooded and the machinery therein greatly damaged. At Folly-hall, Hudderefseld, the river overflowed its banks; and Kaye's factory and the adjoining houseg were flooded to the de th of several feet, leaing a thick deosit of mud and sauin the roads. A short distance low-er down the river, at King's-mill, a smith and carpenter's shop was washed down, and still lower down two large bridges were swept away by the madly onward-rushing torrent. Lower down the river widens oonsiderably, consequently the water had less force, but for a considerable distance on each side tho fields present an appearance of one solid mass of water. At Faruley, a village about three miles distant from Huddersfield, a woman named Betsy Farrand, who was housekeeper to Mr. Edward Roboerts, of S'orthes-moer.house, was struck by the electric fluid on Friday night. and was killed whhUe she was sitting s6wing In a chair. The river Holme subsided as rapidly as itr overflowed, and strangers would be at a loss to conceive the possibility of so small a stream having inflicted so much damage to this locality. From 9 o'clock in the evening the rain came down in torrents, accompanied by heavy thunder and vivid flashes of lightning, and continued without intermission until 4 or 5 o'clock the following morning. There had also been much rain duringthe week, and the rivers and streama had been much swollen in consequence. Never since the Holmfirth flood has there been so much damage done, and even then It was less extensive in many places than now. On Thursday and Friday last the town ahd county of Derby were visited by the most violent and destructive thunderstorms that have occurred for many years. On the Little Chestes road, about a mile from Derby market place, the houses we':e extensively flooded, and tho turnpike for a mile was at least a yard deep in water, and being market day at Derby great inconvenience was consequently sustatned. On the Nottingham road leading out of Derby the flood was also very high. But the greatest injury done is that occasioned to the wheat crop some hndreds of acres being under water. On the ban6s of the Trent and Dove the damaga is very serious, while lambs, sheep, and other live stock have been swept away. The oats generally were gatbered, but the wheat harvest had scarcely commenced. The effect on Derby corn-market was a rise of 3a a-quarter. On Friday evening another storm commenced about 8 o'clock, and continued until 1L, the rain again descending heavily ; in consequence of this there was little abatement of the flooI during Saturday. Many of the local lines out of Derby were blocked. At Sntton, near Mansfield, a culvert burst, and blocked both lines for some hours. At Fickerton, on the Lincoln line, the road was for about two miles completely under water, and the sleepr were vwshed from under the rails. On the North 8tafford line the water washed about 100 yards of line away at Harecastle. The Bipley branch of the Midland Railway was almost wholly submerged, and great damage was sustained. The flood i continued very high throughout Saturday. The town and country round Whitchureb, Salop, were on Friday morning the scene of one of the most terrific stormns of thunder and rain known in these parts for many years. The weather for the week had been of a nature to puzzle its observers, who have been totaUy unable to explain Its movements on any known principles of meteorology. The town of WVhitchurch etands in a hollow, with the land gently rising on all sides of it, the Blckerton hills being some 10 miles distant, and the Welsh hills forming the background of the landscape. This position affects it to a csrtsin degree, and, consequently, the amount of rain is a little above the average, the faU last year having 27-13 inches. Still, August is not generally a wet month, and Its average for the last two years has been only l-321 inches. This month the rain commenced on the 6th, and between that date and the l2th the aunount registered was 1-925 inohes. the barometer meanwhile ranging between 29 5 and 23 !l inches. On the 13th the fall was -805 inches, and people were beginning to hope that this was the end of it, and the fine weather returning. The event showed they were sadly mistaken. By all accounts it was fine till nearly 4 o'clock next morning, when the storm commenced, and continued till nearly half-past 6. The rain fell in t -rrents, while the vividness of the lightning and the crashes of the thunder were terribly grand. As yet there are no tidings of damage done by lightning, but the ravages of the rain are only ton palpable. The amount registered by the rain=auge in les than three hours is almost incredible,--3-18 inches. The Chester and BUlesmere canal has overflowed its banks, -and in the town al the ordinary outlets were inoufflcient for the carrying off so large a body of rain, and the water flowed down the High-street in a stream. Many of the houises in the centre of the town, where the ground is row, have been completely flooded, and the damge done is considerable. At one shop in the high street a large pump was found useless for the removal of tho water collected in the cellars and the parish engine was put in requisition. The post-ofice suffered severely, bat fortunately, owing to the exertions of the postmaster the mailbags were uninjured, and the letters were delivered at the usual hour. The cellars of a publichouse, the Fox and Goose, were filled, and the flacs of the floor above torn away, the contents of the ceUars being spoUed, and some fowls destroyed. The meteorologieal report for the morning is as follows.- Barometer, 29 56 inches ; thermometer, 59° ; wet bulb thermorneter, 590; amount of ramin, 3 18 inches; wind, W. On Thnrsday night the electric fluid struck the Fl-g Tower of Win6sor Castle, displacing about four tons of the parapet, but fortunately did no further damage to any other portion of the Castle. One of the trees in the Home Park, nearly opposite the resideneo of the Duchess of Kent, was struck by the lightning and strtpped of a considerable portion of hark. An elderlv female, named Wilkins, was found dead in her bed on Friday morning; ber death is supposed to have been occasioned by fright at the violence of the storm. At Thorpo the liqlitning struck a barn bi-longing to Ur. Joseph Taylor, causing great destruction of farm property and produce. At Reading the storm was equallv terrific and destructive ; the lightning struck the engine-house at Messrs. Barratt, Exall, and Co's.

" , and fiDUyarivod -rinzloryatthe following condusions:- L That no alteatlon should be mdeo In the preaent system of steamers' ligts. 2. That the bright ight now oxhibltei by sailing vessels when under sal orl being towed should be abolished, aad that, instead thenrof, such vessel should exbibit between snset and sunrise to any vessel or vessels, a rediligbt on the port side, and a green light on the starboard side, eorresponding to the coloured Aide light now shown by steamers, without any reference to tacks b e 3. That them ooloured lights should be fixed when practicable, and that when such 2ghts are not fised places hould be provided in which the lights should be kept on their respective aides, ready for exhibitifon. 4. That all lights, whether fised or exhibited by hand, shold be so screened as te render them invisible on theoppos;to bow or side of the vessel, which the oommittee consider quito practicable. 5. That the lights proposed to be exhibited by tailing vessels should In no case be of less size or power thAin the lantern which the oommittee recommend, and which shows an uniforru and unbroken light over 16 points of the com- pass. 6. That all vessels at anchor, whether steamers or sailing vessels, should exhibit, "where best ween," between sunset; and sunrise, a white light, of uniform size and powrer, in a globular lantern of six inches diameter, at a height not. exceeding 20 feet above the hull of the vessel. 7. The conmittee consider it dedirable farther to recommend that the pilot vessels of the united Idngdom shoald be designated by particular lights. They would therefore submit that, in addition to the red and green lights cow proposed for al classes of sailing vessels, pilot vesses shouuld be permitted to exhibit a white light on a level with t,he red or gre light. 8. The committee having taken into consideration the subject of signals during fogs would recommend, for the rsesons tat"e in the foregoing report, tbat steamers.shonld useeitherthe steam whistle or bell, andthat a1l othervessels should use a fog horn. Finally. The committee are of opinion that the above regulations, if approved by thoir Lordships, should apply to all vessels of the united kingdom in every part of the world, nnless specially excepted b the Admiralty. The committee cannot closo their report without tating that the evidence adduoed proves that the number of collisions is chiefiy attributable to the neglect of a " good lookout," and they submit that it should be strongly impressed on the masters of all vessels that this important duty be, more rWdly attended to.
THE GREAT N0RTHzERN RAILWAY ACCIDENZ' TO THE EDITOX OF TEIE TIMES. Sir,-A&s correct information of the melancholy accidents, which occurrd ontheGreatNorthern Bailwaylast night may notbe unacoeptable tothyreaders, and doubtless a relief from deep anxiety to the relatives of the numerous passengers, I respectfuUy inform thee that the express train from Ring'scroes last night (in whic I was a passenger) was literally smashed to pieces about six or seven miles north of Newark. The train was travelling at about 40 or 45 miles an hour, when. of a sudden we experienced about two sharp bumps, and instantly, in the midst of rushing water, tbe carriages were dashed to pieces in fearful confusdon, some at an angle of 45 degrees upon the others, nearly the whole 12 carriages being torn to pieces, or thrown wildly about the line. The engine and tender were thrown over into a deep water drain; the next, a luggage van, folowing; after which the carriage in which I waS riding was thrown across the line on its side. Being mnyself on top of three other passengers, and able to get out of a hole in the side of our comnpartment, then forming the roof, my companions helped me out, when, in a few minutes, I got help of the passengers who had escaped, and we tore the roof away from the d6ris of our carriage and at once began a search for our fellow-passengers. It being about midnight and neither moon nor stars to be seen, aided by the vivid lightning and ultimately a lamp, we believe we ascertained correctly that no life was lost, which, on beholding the mass of rin, fiUs our hearts with gratitude to our Almighty Preserver from instant death. The second carriage had the ends torn out, and the third carriage was sosmashedthat only the roofaskant prevented the fourth passenger carriage, inounted in the air) from falling upon a rnan lying with his right leg broken. An infant was nearly drowned, and I fear cannot. ~nrvive. One person (I believe, the guard) had concussion of the spine. A gentleman and lady, with numerous family, were both injured in the back, and elsewhere. AU suffered much from exposure to the flood and rain. After extricating a lady and child who were jammed in with luggage, I waded through the flood to reach the next station to get medical help, and get fires prepared. When about 80 yards northwards I came acroms another train smashed across the line-viz., the up fish train, whicb, it appears, was disabled-before ours. I climbed over the engine, tender, and d.riz of two smashed waggons, with their contents, and reached the station at Carlton-on-Trent, where I found another up-traia, about twro miles from the ncene of such wild confuslozi, wlich had been withal over shadowed with Providential care. At the end of four hours we who needed medical care received very kind attention, and by borrowing the up-train, after the very protracted decision of the Carlton statlonmaster, we proceeded slowly to the spot and secured alive, I hope, all-I say hope, because. it is possible some may have been foroed under the watee and kept there by the ruins. Great attention and kindness were shown by the porters. and guards who assisted, and they with credit to their humanity firmly declined pecuniary offers. The landlord anLd othors of the inn at Cariton, as also those connected with this house, the Queen's Hotel, Retford, where the remainder of the pasengers have beers brought, have shown great desire to promote the oomf,'rte ,cf all falling under their care. The whole of the cases may be considered slight injuries, tcxept the spinal injury and fractured leg. I write this from bed, and therefore only aim to convey faots, leaving the public to form its own judgmnent ot ther propriety of rushing so fearfully over flooded land, which the most unskilful person would consider detrimental to thle baLlast and sleepers of a railway. I enclose my address and reference for respectability, and remain, Thine respectfully, JA^MES WITHERS. Queen's ROWe, Retford, Aug. 14.
NmTISANCES o1; THE BAEIcs OF TITE RiVER TiA.HMrES. - Some correspondence between Mr. Goldsworthy Gur-,ey, the Board of Works, and the Commissioners of Sewcrs on the state of the river Thames and the pollution of the air on the banks of the Thames and at the Rouses of Parlianiont, was publisbed by order of the House of Commnors on Saturday, on the motion of Mr. Estcourt, M.P. Mr. Guldswortby Gurney, in May, June, and July last, pointed out at length in some valuable reports to the Board of Works a number of aboiniuable nuisances arising from the state of the sewers in the vicinitv of the N( w Palace atWestminster, and other causes, muost iuj ari.us to the health of the memnbers. The source of tho ori-i n1l evil (certain untrapped gullyholes in St. Margaret's.st-evt, New Palaoe-yard, aLnd the open mouth of Bridgo-esreet sewer) was cnt off some time since, but, although the greater nuisance is removed, the minor annoyance remains. This was pointed out in a reDort of 1855. ft arises from natrapped sewers on the soutth side of the tiver near Lambeth Palhce, besides two at MiUbauk, one at the Penitentiary, and two at Vauxhall-bridge. The sewar4 at Lambeth and Millbank are the most offensive. Another source of pestilential eauuvia, affectingthe atmosphere of aho Houses of Parliamnent, is the existence of bonc and other offensive manufactories on the south side of the river and also exhalations from the river itself. In June l.s' Mr. uarney reported the river to be in so pestilentiAl , state that it was difficult to keep the stench out of the Houses of Parliament, and he urged the trappin, the open mouths of certain sewers forthwith. Mr. Gurnes 'a appeals to the Board ox Works were seconded by Slr. R. Burrell, of the Lord Great Chamberlain's office, 11.1ue of Lords, who (July 16) complained that the stench fr,ui the river compelled him to close aLl his windo-e, but that the poisonous effluvia penetrated to hiq rooms notwithstanding, causinug headache, nansea, and l ;s of appetite. "The nuisanoe," he sa£,V "iS berorning ereateraunnually," and common humauity, he adds, req ires tbat the Government should seriously take up the queqti-on of the purification of the Thames. The Board of W*,rks ordered Mr. Gardiner, on the 21st unt., to put himself in cerimunication with Mr. Gurnay for the abatement of the nuisance arising from the manufactories on the south side of the river, and tMr. Bazlgette, the engineer, was also referred to. Ultimately it was intimated to the Board i f Works by the Secretary of State (on the 29th nIt.), that theo prosection of nuisances was left by the Metropciis Local Managclwent .Act to the local authorities of parisbes, to whom, as armed with ample powers, Sir G. Gray suggested tbht applicatton should be made in the case- referred to. The state of the Thames, meanwhile, remains as before. ExTRAOPIhARY SALE OF LAND .AND NECROES. -The estate of Alexander Moore, of Halifa.x eounty, Vir. giuia, was appraised imniediately after his death, in 18f*, ab between 021,G00 and 122,000. Tbe executor, Air. WoodSon Hughes, Kept the estate together until October, 1850, when he nade sale of the whole property at public auction for caAb, or for bonds wel tecured bearing interest from date. I he estate at the time of the sale consisted of 1,000 acres of lsr.d and 45 slaves. Five of these slaves were old nnd deci epit, and were an encumbrance. From the year 1850 to I1M)6 several likely slaves had died, so that altogether there bnd been no increase; and yet this property, appraised in 1850 at $j22,03'0, w,Vas sold at public auctton for cash or its e,quivalent for the Immnense sum of $70,00O. It will be thus si u that the property bad more than trIpled in value in the brnef space of five years.-T'o?aerco Plant.

FARLIA.MENTARY INTELLIGENE. ROUSE OF COMINIONS, SATrFlDAY, ArGoST 1T. The Sr EAIKER took the chair at 12 o'clock. PETITION S. 'Jr. Joine LOCKE presented a petition from Mr. Glover, recently member for Beverley, but unseated on petition on the ground of want of qualification, praying the House to Institute a fresh inquiry into the nature of his qualification at the time of his election; but the Hlouse, adopting the opinions of the Speaker and Sir George Grey, refused to receive it, on the grounid that the decision of the committee which had already investigated the matter was final. Mr. Vi i.i.imIs presented a petition from the men in the employwentof Messrs. Chubbs, in Wolverhauipton, in favour of a half-holyday on Saturday in lieu of opening places of amusement on Sunday. NEW PALACE-YARD. Mr. CONOLLY asked the First Commissioner of Works whether his attention had been drawni to the present arrangement for ingress to and egress fromiziew 'alace yard, and whether it was not possible to effect some improvement in the samie. Sir B. ilALL said he was not at all aware of any inconvenience of the kInd referred to until ho saw the notice of the hon. member's question on the paper. Hle would make Inquiry into the matter, and if any inconvenience was exporienced from the present arrangement he would take steps to have it remedied. MR. GLADSTONE AND THE AfOR2NING POST. As the llouse was about to pass to the consideratIon of the orders of the day, Mr. (,LADSTONE, advorting to the personal statement he had mado cn the previous night, said it appeared that he had used the word " falsehoods" with respect to the allega. t:ons made in reference to himself of which he had then complained, and as that term might imply wilful falsehoo(Lo, he begged to explain that his intention was simply to use the word " untruths." The Charitable Trusts Acts Continuance Bill, the Mutiny (East India) Bill, and the Parochial Schoolmiasters (Scot. land) (No. 2) Bill, were severally read a third time and passcd witliout discussion, MILITIA BILL. On the motion for going into committee on this Bill, Mr. STAFFORD said allusion had been made in a re. cent debate to the difficulty of procuring recruits for the militia, and no niember except the Priine Minister had tiken any notice of that statement. He (Mr Stafford) had since made it his business to ascertain whether there was any reason assigned for that difficulty, for he thought it wouild be a pity that the statement in question should go forth to the public if there was no foundation for it. He c-nf,ssed he had no apprehension of such difficulty being femlt. At the present moment it was, no doubt, of the utmost importance that every hour of sunshine and day. light should be made use of in getting in the harvest; and, in consequence of the large quantities of cereals now grown in Ireland, tue same amount of labourvwas not available for this country as in former years, but as soon as the har. vest was cotmipleted there would be no difficulty in obtain. Ing recruits. The liberal scale of pensions given to the soldiers at the close of the Crimean war would be a great Inducement to men even of a better class than usual to enlist. There was also a very general feeling throughout the country that the soldier shotuld be well provided for and well looked after. It would not fail to have a beneficial rffect if soeni reliable assurances were given by the War. office that every care would be taken of the mnen during the ,:crilous anid dangerous service on which they embarked amid lie suggested tho desirability of the Under-Secretary for War, before the close of tho sesrion, laying before the Jhouse all the arrangements for clothing, medical comforts, and hospital accommiiodation to be provided for the army serving abrcad. The Bill then passed through committee. CONSOLIDATION FUND (APPIROPIRIATIOfN) BILL. The House went Into committee on this BilL IUpon one of the clauses, Mr. CAIIl) attempted to put a question to the Chian. cellor of the lIxchequer wvith respect to the vot of 10,00 )1. for an inlustrial muiseum in Edinburgh, which was withdrawn by the Government in Committee of Supply. The CiIAIRIMAN ruled that it would be irregular to raise a discussion upon a clause whlch did not refer to the vote. Several clauses were agreed to. Upon the motion that the Chairman report progress and ask leavo to sit again, Mlr. CAII D said the question which he wished to put to the right hon. gentleman was whether he would introduce the vote again on Monday in Conminittee of Supply. The Scotch members generaUly were not present to support the vote on a former occasion, b.lieving that there was no necessity for their remaining, as the proposal had been adopted by the Government. It was impossible to draw a comparison between England and Scotland, because the institutions of England were imperial. But it was quite possible to institute a comparison botween Scotland and Ireland, and he found that while in income.tax, pro. perty-tax, and probate amid legacy duties, Sce-tlaud contri. tuted more than Ireland, Ireland received bv votes out of tfie consolidated fund 1,800,0001. annua31y to 400,0001., or four times as much as Scotland. It was a proper object to establish an Industrial muscum in the capital of Scotland where the prodluce of the country could be seen, and a great injustice hadbeeL d-1ne to Scotland by the withdrawal of the vote. (Hear.) Mr. HADFIELD hoped that they would not for a moment put Scotland in comparison with Ireland. (A laugh.) Mr. GLADSTONE, who rose with Mr. Macartney, implored for peace between Scotland and Ireland, and assured Irish memberstbat the bellicose sentiments of the hoo. memnber for Sheffield were not participated in by the generality of members. At the same time he was bomind to say inlionour to Ireland that within the last three or four years they iad imposed burdens before unknown on that country, and those burdens bad been cheerfully borne. (IHear.) With resard to the Scotch museum, :ie thought his lion. friend (lr. Caird) had done no more t,han his duty in bringing it before their attention, but lie apprehended that it was totally impossible for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to comply with the request which had been made. Whether they wero absolutely precluded by the rules of thelilomee he could not say, but it would be utterly irregular to bring in the vote again on Monday next. They could not expect to hear any more of the proposal this session. Ila was very sorry it was not discussed the other night upon the miierits. Thlere was no opportunlity for discussing It because there w.as a natural Inclination to close Committee of Supply. It was unfortunate, whatever timo cause, that the vote was withdrawn, as the feelings of Scotland were wounded by the proposal belng thrown over, after it had received the sanction of suecessi ve Governmnents. Ireland, lie believed, had a similar Institution in Dublin. lie honed the Chancellor of the Ex. chequer would give an assuranice that the question had not escaped the attention of the Govermment, and that, upon full consideration of the amount required, they were prepared to submit as early as possible a vote to give effect to a design not only gratifying, but eminently useful. (ffear, hear.) Mr. DE V El E deprecated comparisons betwemn the burdens and contributions of different parts of the empire. The CHANCELLIOR of the EXCilEQUElt said, he should consider the iiatter simply on the merits, without entering upon comparisons, which were Proverbially odious. The grant was actually moved, and an opnportunity given to any lion. member to state his opinions iupon It. Some years ago ground in J.dinburgh was purehased with a view to the erection of an industrial musemiiii. During the war the Governmnent did not think It desirable to propose say vote for that purpose, but this year they did propose a vote, and as the site had cost between 8,0001. and 9,0001.. they did. not think 40,0001. an unreasonable sum. They proposed to take 10,0007. this yea-., which would have given the means of completing a considerable portion of the building without any very heavy prossure on the finances. Represent%tions were made by persons of weight and Influence urging the Government to purchase land ad joining that whicll bad been previously acquired, but the Government resisted the proposal, and adhered to the original design. 'When the matter came to be discussed in Committee of Supply there seemed to be a rather strong impression that the Government were about to make large demands on tho fil-nces for assistance to the East India Company. The feelinS pervaded the House, and induced reluctance to vote anything not abEolutely necessary. In deference to what seemed to be the all but universal opinion of the committe, the Government withdrew the vote, and he felt sure that if it hri been pressed to a division a majority would have voted against it. (hlear, hear.) Ho would take this opportunity of expressing his opinion that while he admitted the justice of many of the criticisms on the augmentation of the civil estimates, still that increase of expenditure, If not in almost every case, certainly in a majority of Cases was not madle for any eorrupt or profligate objects, or f or the gratification of any personal or individual tastes, "> p lurposes 0 r general and public utility. Such. for example, was the vote for a museum in the city of Edin- burgh. (Hfear.) As had been suggested, the Government would feel It their duty at as early a period as convenient to repeat the proposition to the House, but he did not think any advantage would arise from attempting to bring forward more votes in Committee of Supply during t ge present session. (Ilear.) Mr. M &CARTN1EY had opposed the vote, simply because he thought they ought to suspend all votes not absolutely required with the very large expenditure which must be mow anticipatedl. The LORD-ADVrOCATE said, he was not present when this grant was last before the ilouse, otherwise he should bave made an observation upon it. He believed it was intended and caloulated to serve a very useful and important purpose-irmportant, not only to Scotland, but to the whole country. Scotland had always shown herself ready to take advantz e of the means available for the promotion of great public objects, as in the case of agricultural statistics, where bth landlords and tenants had evinced the utmost willingness to do that which was only now beginning to be done partially in England. I-e hoped that the next time the vote was proposed It would not be treated as a Scotch ques. tiou. (Hear, hear.) The motion for reporting progress was then withdrawn, and the remaining clauses of the Appropriation Bi were agreed to. The following Bills were passed through com ittee Customs and Excise, Customs, and Jurisdiction in Siam. The Probates and Letters of Administration (Ireland) vas conddered as amended. CROWDED DWELrINGS PREV-ENTIO N BILL. On the motion for going into committee upon this ttllI, Mr., AYiRTON said that, as he understood the object of the BiU, It was to declare that wherever two or more porsons chose to reside together in a house or part of a house, and they were not within certain very limited degrees of con. sanguinity, their dweling vws to be treated as a common lodginghouse, exposed to the visitation of inspectors, and brought within all the stringent and arbitrary clauses of tho Act ior the regulation of lodginghouses. That appeared to hiim to be a great infraction of the liberties of the humibler classes, and, however benevolent the object might bo, it wai their duty to take care that they were not carried away by their feelings to pass a law which would place the peop!l entirely under the power and control of the exeonltive oli cers of the Government, who were to regulate all their social affairs. Mr. COWVPER said that words had boen introduced into the Bi3 since it had come down from the Lords which would entirely obviate the objections taken by the lion. member for the Tower Hamlets. The provisionIs of tho measure would only apply to dwellings which would conuo under the designation of common lodging-honises. All that the BiB attempted to do with the Lodging-honses Act was to define the word " family," and how far it would oxtenid inl order to exempt a common lodging-house from the operation of the Act. So far as the operation of the Commiiion Lodging-house Acts was concerned, it had been found to be beneficial to the keepers of those houses as well as the lodgers. The right hon. gentleman read sotn extracts from the report of the Commissioner of l'olice, showving the wretchedly crowded state of some of the lower class of lodging-houses, and the scenes of protligacy and indecency which they presented, and as the present Bill was simply an amendment in one very small respect of the existing Act, he hoped the Hlouse would consent to go Into committee on the Bill. Mr. IIENLEY reminded the House that it was expressly stated by the noble lord at the head of the Government on the previous night that the BiUs to be dealt with in the sitting that day would be those only which were unopposed. Mr. COWPER said, under those circumstances he would postpone proceeding with the Bill until Monday. Mr. RIDLEY suggested that the Bil should be postponed altogether for the present session, inasmuch as otherwise It would be impossible to collect the opinion of the country on its probable operation before it passed into a law. The motion for going into committee was then withdrawn, and the Bill was ordered to be committed on Monday. The Eouse adjourned at 2 o'clock.
IRELAIND. (FRlO5 OnTR OVN : \ DUBLIN, SATURDAY MO)RNLNG. FRAUDULENT OFFICLALS. The Bill to be brought in by the Irish AttorneyGeneral for depriving officials of the immunity they nlow enjoy, and compelling them to pay their just debts or resign their offices, has given the greatest possible satisfaction here. It was full time that something should be done to check a scandal against wvhich the public voice had so long protuisted in vain. A Belfast paper (the Mercury) will be readily credited when it says:- " We know men wbo occupy seats on the bench of justice to administer our laws, yet who are greater culprits, in many ways, than the unfortunate wretches they send for a three months' airing to Richmond for offences trivial to what theirs are. We have Crown officials who live out of the jurisdiction, and discharge the duties of their oSices by deputy,-snapping their fingers at their creditors, and gloryiog in the impartiality of our laws. We have assistant. barristers who skulk into the country on a Sunday to open their sessions, and so manage the business by adjournments as to skulk out of it again without being arrested. When fairly ' on circuit' they are privileged frons arrest, and thus the administration of justice is made the means of downright roguery. It is now full time that aU such absurd ' privileges ' s!iould be abolished. In olden times such privileges wero necessary ; they had their origin in a due regard for the public intercst. it was then requisite to protect tho weak against the overwhelming influence of the rich and powerful; but, like all privileges of the kind, they soon degenerated, and became perverted from their original use. Now, their existence is a monstrous reflection on public justice, and leads to the most scandalous frauds. It is, therefore, a movement in the right direction that contemplates their abolition." TIlE SPOLLENS. The Freenutit's Journal intimates that for the last two days Spollen has been going about. and in the most audacious manner soliciting subscriptions to compensate hiim for the loss he has sustained during his imprisonment. Stories of the strangest and iiiost startling cliaracter are circulated about him, some of which, it is surmised, are not without foundation. Saundcrs of this day says:- " Yesterday James Spollen the younger entered the rail. way premises and presented a letter from his father to Mr. Osborne, the storekeeper, asking that a contribution might be made for his son, who he said could not be deserted, as he was to accompany him on 'a long journey.' The application was met -with disgust and a flat denial fromi every man in the establishment. Shortly after he and his son James called on a car at Mr. Kemmis's house in Eldare. street; he, it appeared, was not at home, but later in the day, about 4 o'clock, they again called, but Mr. Kemmis would not see them, and they went away. The motive of their visit is not known, but is supposed to be either a solicitation for pecuniary assistance or in reference to his wife, with whom he strongly desires an interview. She, however, resolutely srefuses to see or hear from him." THE FUNDS. Three per Cent. Consols, 908; ditto, for account, 10th of September, 90 ; New Three per Cent.

TIIE LATE ACCIDENT ON TIEE GREAT NORTHERNq RAEIl.VAY.-From an early hour on Friday morning, up to 9 a.m. on Saturday, a large staff of workmen were em- oyed, under the direction of Mr. Sturrock, head of the locomotive department, in temporarily repairing the dameaged portion of the main line of the Great Northern Ra?ilway, near Carlton, where a double break down of trains occurred at midnight on Thursday, as already reported in Th1e Times, and the down express to E:dinburghl on Saturday morning was conveyed along the main routo, whichl has since been open for passenger traffic. As both the ordinary lines were blocked, and an engine and train were overturned on each side of the rail. way, a tramway of a single line had to be made in a sinuous form to afford a passage for the regular trains through the wreck. One of the overturned engines was got up on Saturday night, and up to yesterday (Sunday) considerable pro. grass had been made with the removal of the broken carriages and trucks. When these are entirely cleared away the permanent line will be repaired and the rails restored to their former condition. The flooding of the line was not owing to the overflow of the river Trent, as has been stated, but to the Insufficiency of the culverts under the line to carry away the Immense body of flood water which pressed against them, and which therefore rose to the level of the line, and washed awaTy the ballast and the embankment (only a few feet high), leaving the rails and sleepers suspended like a skeleton line above the flood. When the fish train from the north came to the spot it plunged into the gulf, and engine and trucks were instantly submerged. Almost at the same instant the Edinburgh passenger train, one of the fleetest in the kingdom, came up from the south, at a rate of between e0 and G0 miles an hour, and fell with a tremen. deus crash into the vortex, one of the passenger carriages being tlhrown completely on the top of another. Most of the passengers had complacently settled themselves into sleeping positions, and when rudely awakened by the slick of the breakdown and pitched into the torrent, their cloaks, caps, &c., flew off, and they found themselves struggling in the water. In the course of the foUlowing day the articles of dress thus lost were found in the water, together with various boxes, portmanteaus, hat cases, packages, and other things, among which we noticed a silver claret JUg and a pair of silver candlestieks, together with several books, all of which were forwarded to Retford for identifica. tion. The two passengers who were most hurt, and who were left at Carlton, were going on well on Saturday evening. The rest of the wounded had been forwarded to their several destinations. The injury done by the flood to the loop line between I1etford and Saxilby was repaired on Friday evening, and Onl Saturday both pairs of metals were got Into working order. The stoppage of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire line between Retford and Gainsborough was also remaoved on Saturday. OIpENING(: oF "THE PEorax's PARK," HALIFAX. -On Friday last Mfr. Frank Crossley, M.P.. presented to the Corporation of Halifax, as the trustees for the inhabitants, a large and beautifully ornamented plot of ground, to be called '1 The People's Park." The park, which extends over an area of between 12 and 13 acres, is situated on high ground on the westeru side of the town, and commands an extensive and picturesque prospect of the surrounding country, which from this view is finely diversified by valleys and slopes. The grounds have been laid out from designs by Sir Joseph Paxton,under the superintendeneo of -Mr. Mihnes and Mr. Dawson, of Sydenhwam and are of tho most attractive character, a serpentine sheet of water at the lower end and a large stone basiu in the centre, from which springs a beautiful fountain, adding to the general effect. There is also some fine marble statuary on the terraces by Mr. George Biennanie, of Carrara, including Elercules, Venus at the Bath, Aristides, Apollo Belvidere, Diana, and Canova's Dancing Girl. The purchase of the ground and the expense of laying it out have cost Mr. Crossley about 30,0001., and it is presented to the corporation on certain conditions, the chief of which are that the park shall be opened all the year round, in. cluding Sundays, free of charge, but sball only be used as a promenade, the holding of public meetings and anniversaries i t being prohibited; that bands of music shall not be allowed on Sundays, and that no dancing shall be per. mitted at any time, nor refreshments sold within it; that the corporation shall spend not lass than 3151. per annum in keeping it in order, and on their failing to fulfil these conditions the park to revert to Mr. Crossley or his heirs. The occasion was celebrated with unusual festivity, the day being observed as a general holyday, and the various lodges and trades walking in procession to the park, While the procession was forming Mr. Crossley entertained about 400 gentlemen to luncheon, and speeches were delivered by Mr. Crossley, the Earl of Shsaftesbury, Lord Goderich, Sir Charles Wood, and others; after which the company joined in the proecession. The procession having entered the park, the deed of conveyance was formally signed and presented to the corporation by Mr, Crossley, and after the presentation of addresses to Mr. Crossley from the corporation, the inhabitants, an,d the HIalifax Temperance Society, Mr. Crossley, the Earl of Shaftesbury, Sir C. Wood, and Lord Goderich addressed the assembly, which numbered not less than from 16,000 to 20,000 persons, and the proctediLugs nero brought to a close,
AMONEY-MAIBKI1TanuIOITYINTELLIGMNO. Saturday Evening. The fiunids havo experienced a further advance to-day, maiking a total rocovery of II per cent. from tho point toule'od dIurinig tho Indian rumours of last week.

For tho account the last transactions were at (lI to t. Money was in good supply both in theStock-Exchange and the discount-market, and the npplications at the Bank were few. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 216 ; Reduced, 91 to g; New Three per Cents., 916 to i; India Stock, 212 to 213 Iidia Bonds, of -which there were several purchases, 256. to 20s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. dis.. count to par.

There were no transactions on the Paris Bourse to-day, owing to the Napoleon fite. The hope of a communication to India by the Euphrates is at an end, or rather is to be left to time and accident, since no one looking at the map of the world will believe that any combination of circumstances can prevent its ultimate accomplishment. As in the case of other designs of like magnitude, those who have devoted themselves to pro. mote it by calm and honest means may be disappointed and worn out, but the tide of human energy will not permit barriers to remain which, although physically insignificant, are yet found sufficient to separate the most important regions of the earth. The difficulty will be solved either by good or bad agencies, and although Governments may exercise much influence in choosing between the two, they can no more alter the ultimate result in this than in any other impulse of mankind. In the discussion on the subject last night in the House of Commons every material point was admitted. "There can be no doubt," said Lord Palnerston, " that if railway communication were established along the route indicated a considerably increased facility in the conduct of our commercial and political intercourse with the empire of India must be the conse quence." The objections against promoting it were simply two, and inconsistent with each other -namely, that it is inexpedient for the Government to interfere in enterprises which should be treated as of a purely commercial character, and that the present question is so thoroughly political that any aid granted, however desirable, might lead to embarrassments with other Powers. Either the first or the second of these arguments must therefore be abandoned. Doubtless the latter, which was adopted by Lord Palmerston, is the true one. The work is postponed or sacrificed to avoid disagreeable complications, and on that noint there is, perhaps, nothing to be said. It would be idle for those who share the general confidence with which the country regards the foreign policy of the Premier, and who trust equally in his foresight whether caution or courage be the quality most needed for the moment, to set at nought his opinion and to clamour that the matter should be carried through at all hazards. No one has the opportunities possessed by the Government of estimating the hostility wnth which the enterprise would be met. Indeed, immediately after the recent consultations at Osborne an impression was circulated that this w-as one of the very points on which we had made concessions. Whether the assertion be true or otherwise, it is but fair to conClude that the course pursued on Mr. Liteourt's motion was the result of deep consideration upon jontingencies which, as far as the public are concerned, may wisely for the time be left open to conjecture. The shareholders and directors of the Great \Vestern Railway have made a compromise prompted by timidity on both sides. The directors had already announced the appointment of a committee from among themselves to investigate the liabilities and expenditure, and they have now agreed to admit four shareholders to its sittings. There wvas no pretence on the part of the directors that they were entitled to demand continued confidence, but they pointed out that it would be politic fop the shareholders to support them, "as it would strengthen the position of the company in the eyes of the public." Whether the public will be deluded accordingly is a doubtful (uestion. During 22 years this grand undertaking has been so managed that upon its capital of 8,237,2761, the half-yearly dividend has been brought down to 10s. per cent., the directors throughout the whole of the time holding out that their future prospects were full of hope. Their judgment, therefore, must have been wrong from the first. Either the undertaking was a sound one and they have brought it by mismanagement to its present pass, or it was altogether without any remunerative elements, and they have shown their incapacity by constantly deluding themselves and others into a contrary opinion. At such a stage it might be supposed they would sophisticate no longer, but candidly avowv, "We have made a great mistake one way or the other, and, although we claim credit for good intentions, we feel that we have shown ourselves incompetent for our task, and that there must be other hands that can better administer the property. This acknowledgment is the more necessary because, after aUl our experience, we are unable to su-gest a single plan of restoration. We can cut dovn expenses, but that of course any one can do, and we are naoreover in the dilemma that if they are not larger than is necessary cutting them down must be fraught with danger; while, on the other hand, if they have really been excessive we stand self-condemned for having allowed them." Instead, however, of this modest and digni6ied course, something like the following is virtuaUy the tone :-" At the end of a quarter of a century it is painful for the directors to have to submit the worst accounts ever yet produced. But we repeat what we have said all along, that you must trust to the future and make no change of management. Meanwhile some of you would doubtless like to see your shares higher in the market, in order that you might get out and let others in. If so, you must take care what you do in the eyes of the public. The public are extremely shallow, and if you intimate by supporting uS that there has been nothing wrong, and that we have shown ourselves just the men stil to manage your interests, they will feel satisfied that past mishaps have arisen from exceptional and uncontrollable causes, and, trusting our predictions of revival, will come forward and buy any number of shares you may wish to dispose of." Happily, the appeal has not been quite acceded to. The meeting were obvieusly affected at the possibility of the shares being depreciated in case of bold and complete measures being taken, but they nevertheless procured the nomination of four new men to assist the directors in their endeavours at extrication. This may probably be a valuable and even a sufficient step, provided the selection be made from persons of independence and vigour. It is a curious thing to see the labour of setting auch an undertaking right thrown upon people who are to receive neither remuneration nor honour, while pay and distinction continue to be absoibed by those who have done all the mischief; but that is a minor consideration, and, as there is apparently no personal feeling against any of the directors, there can be no public dissatisfaction at their retaining their position so long as it is found that the duties for which they are paid wvl be cheerfully and gratuitously performed by individual shareholders desirous of promoting so generous an arrangement. About 12,000l. was withdrawn from the Bank today for exportation. The Parana5 for the West Indies on Monday, will take out 49,G307., of which 29,6001. is silver. The folrowing is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-At a meeting of the Great Western the report and accounts were adopted, and a dividend declared for the past half-year at tha rate of I per cant. per annum. An amendment to appoint a committee of investigation was negatived by a large majority. The rep3rt shows the total receipts on capital accomunt to have been 23,527,3641., and the total expenditure 23,115,4061. The deben. tures loans, &c., amount to 10,603,7801. The gross revenue for the half-year is 768,9541., and after deduction of working expenses, interest on loans and preference stock, and other charges against revenue, a disposable sum is left of 51,1971., out of which 41,1861. is appropriated for a dividend on 8,237,2767. ordinary capital, the balance carried over being 10,0111. The heavy expenditure requisite for the completion of their autnorized system of railways is being brought to a close, the opening of tlle Devizes branch having finished the whole of the railways the company are authorized to make. The decrease in the dividend from 2A per cent. at the corresponding period of 1856 to 1 per cent. for the past half-year is owing to the whole of the interest on the capital, except 7,6171., being charged for the first timne against the revenue. The increase in the items of interest on loans and preference shares thus charged amounts to 60,8001., and is about equivalent to a dividend on the consolidated stock of the company at the rate of 1I per cent. per annuma. This result was to a great extent anticipated, but it was hoped that the profit arising from the increase of traffic would have reduced the pressure. The traffic, however, on the new lines had not been sufficient to pay their working expenses. The total receipts show an increase of 64,0001. over the corresponding period of last year, while, on the other hand, the working expenses have been 67,0001. more. The company have now 467k miles of railway in operation against 367k in 1856. The chairman stated that the principles upon which the company wiU henceforth be managed are to abstain from all branches, extensions, and guarantees, and to carefully develope the traffic on the existing lines. The greatest economy will be exercised in the working and all other expenses. Explanations were given with respect to the appointment of Mr. Brunel as consulting engineer, and the gratuity of 5,0001. to Mr. Saunders, the secretary. It has been certified that the rolling stock is better than at any period for the last four or five years. At a meeting, of the London and North-NVestern the report was adopted, and a dividend declared for the past balf-year at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the consolidated stock of the company. It was stated that a larger net profit might have been shown if the directors had confined themselves to maintaining the stock and the road in the identical form in which they were many years ago, but a large amount has been expended from revenue on improvements in the roling stock and in new works. An additional capital is required for providing houses on the Stour Yalley line for the accommodation of the compmny's servants, carriage sheds, and additional carriages. New warehouses will be erected and ready for use in the ensuing winter in the place of those burnt at Camden-town. The report of the Eastera Counties shows that the total receipts for the past half-year amount to 519,2151., and that, after payment of working and other expenses, and interest on guarantees and loans, a balance available for distribution remains of 79,7991.; out of which a dividend of 5s. per share on the consolidated stock is anntounced. The increase in the net receipts as compared with the corresponding period last year has been 31,8771.; and the loas on the working under the agreement with the Norfolk and Eastern Union is 1,8721. only against 27,3441. in 185G. There has been no addition to the capital account in respect of the locomotive or permanent way departments, but only of 1,7501. for buildings and 7,4171. for land. The half-yearly report of the Ulster Company shows an increase in the receipts of 2,8001. and in the working expenses of 1,6551. The net balance is 21,8281., and, after deducting interest on borrowed capital,there remains 17,8391. out of which a dividend is recommended at the rate of G per cent. per annum. The Portadown and Dungannon line wiU probably be opened about the end of SeDtember. The company's Bill for the extension to Omagh has passed. The Tilbury, M1aldon, and Colchester scheme is abandoned. The report of the Vale of Neath shows an increase of receipts for the six months of 10,1711. over the corresponding period last year. The dividend recommended is at the rate of 4; per cent. per annum. The dividend of the Hull and Selby is proposed at the rate of 41. 19s. per cent. per annum. The Lancashire and Yorkshire have offered to the Sheffield, Barnsley, Wakefield, and Goole a fixed rate of 13,5001. a-year in lieu of thepresent payment, and half surplus profits received by the latter company. At a meeting of the Manchester, Buxton, and Mhidland Junction a dividend of is. Ad. was declared. The traffic on the Rowsley line has considerably increased. At a meeting of the Rlhyiney Companyit was stated that the BiU to raise 100,0001. additional capital awaited only the Royal assent, The Bute Dock branch will be ready for mineral traffc in the course of next month. The progress on the main line has not been satisfactory. The report of the Monkland shows a balance for dividend of 20,G211., and a distribution at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum is proposed, bein an increase of 1 per cent over the last. New eapital is to be raised to carry out the new works authorized this session. At the meeting of the Stockton and Darlington it was stated that the increase in their revenue amounted to 20,0001., while the working expenses were only 8,0001. more than in the same periodj,ast year. In addition to the 49 or 50 iron furnaces in cor-nexion with the line, eight more have been commnwiced, and the traffic of the railway wiU therefore be proportionably increased. It will be necessary, however, to raise capital for additional rolling stock. A dividend at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum was declared on the ordinary shares. At the meeting of the North London the dividend was at the rate of 4i per cent. per annum. The company were stated to have been subjected to a larger charge than usual for accidents. The permanent way is reported in excellent order. Of the receipts for the sale of surplus land 30,0001. has been appropriated for new engines, and 20,0001. for paying off debentures. The report of the Midland shows an increase in the traffic over the same periodl in 1856;of 45,1931., and a reduction in the working expenses from 43-81. to 41-161. per cent. The balance available for dividend is 255,1221. and a distribution of 21. 2s. 6d. on the consolidated stock is recommended. The Leicester and Hitchin line was opened for the carriage of minerals on the 15th of April and for passengers on the Sth of 3May, and already the result is satisfactory. From the large increase of traffic the relaying of the line has proceeded much more rapidly than was onrginally contemplated, and the permanent way fund is in debt 109,5441., although 30,0001. per annum is set aside on that account from the revenue. It is recommended that this debt be paid off by appropriating 20,0001. per annum from the revenue. It is not deemed necessary to continue this fund any longer, but to defray the cost of renewal of the per- manent way year by year. At a meeting of the Royston and Hitehin the usual dividend of 6 per cent, per annum was declared. At the Edinburgh and Bathgate, in consequence of the difficulty of renewing loans on debentures, a call was proposed, unless some temporary arrangement can be made. By the report of the London and Blackwall a balance appears available for dividend of 15,1461., out of vhich 2s. 9d. per share is reeommended. The Bow and Barking line will be opened next year. The accounts of the Whitehaven, Cleator, and Egremont show a balance of 2,7141., which would allow a 10 per cent. dividend, but the directors propose to limit it to 6 per cent.

LONDONDERRY AIND ENNISMUILLEN. The report of the directors of this com Pany states thiat tho receipts for the half.year enzding June 10 amounted to 17,7371., and for the correspondingperiod of1859to 161051., sho-i an increawe of 1,6321. Theo expenditzure amouutEd to 9,70&-, agamnst 9,4291. in the first half of 1856,a°llowiDg an increase of 2711. in tbe expenses, whicb, deducted fro. tbe 1,321. increase of traffic, leaves 1,3611. as the increase in the not revenue. The high rate of interest for money has affected this company in common writh others by in. creasing the charge for intsrest on debentures and loans, and so far lessening the amount availablo for divi. dend. After providing interest on loans there remains a disposable balance of 4,2111. This sum is sufficient, after payment of dividend upon the 6 per cent. 10. shares, to give a dividend of 3Z 3d. per sBare on the 12o. lOs. pre. ference shares, leaving a balance of 701. The time for the repayment of theo Government advance to thls company has been increaed from a perlod of 10 years to a period of 20 yeas, the loan being at 4 per cent. per annum; the exten. slon of time is of importance to the company, Tho capit*l account shows that 637,1785. had been received and 691,6701. expended, leaving a balance of 4,4921. against the comr. pany. STAMFORD AND ESSENDINE. At the half-yearly meeting of this company, General J-hnson in the chair, it was decided, to iasue a limited number of preference shares, in accordance with the Act of Parliament recently obtained. VALE OF NEATH. Tho half-yearly meeting of this cornpany was held at Seatlh on Saturday, Mr. 13. A. Bruce, M.P., in the chair. Tho report, au abstract of which has appeared in 27Ye Tinics, was taken as read. Tho C1HAIRiMAN said the meeting had been hieldI a fortnight earlier than usual at the particular request of cortain of the proprietors. The report of the directors must be regarded as extremely favourable. The receipts. for the half-year amounted to 43,3231. against 32,1501. at the corresponding period of 1S56. There was also concurreatly with this increase in the revenue a gratifying diminution of working expenses from 50 per cent, in ruind numbers, to 47 per cent-a saving of 3 per cent. The dividend proposed to be declared w as 4i1 per cent., and the statement of accounts before the meeting showed a progressive dividend. 1Probably some proprietor seeing that the receipts had been 10,00017. more might have expected a larger increase of dividend. To pay 41 per cent, it was necessary to set aside 14,9641., and a 4 per cent. dividend required 11,7.21., so that 3,1721. more was required. Last year 4,COJI. interest on loan had been charged to revenue account; but this year the whole 6,1421. was charged to revenue account aid none to capital. Then there was 2,0001. set aside for the Aberdale Vallev line, and altogether rather more than the increa.e of 10,0001. lhey had at a rough calculation 60,0001. o.f unproduotive capital, which they hopedl would in good time become productive. Of this sum 15,0007. was advanced toothe Briton Ferry Docks Company. The completion of theEe docks would, by giving them an outlet by sea close at home, mark an entiuely new era in the history of the company. There was also 4 >,000'. laid out in the (as yet) unproductive portion of the Dare and Amman branch. The 20,M00. required for the com pletion of the Briton Ferry Docks had been borrowed, and hiO hoped that by the end of the present year the docks might be sufflciently improved for them to do sonic trade there to relieve the river. What had b- en done by the river had astonished tho traders. He stated that they ex pected the Swansea Dock and extension of the South Wales Railway to the doek would be completed in about a yearand half. He then moved the adoption of the report, which having been seconded, In roply to questions, it was stated that as soon as the shareholders received what they considered a fair remuneration for their capital, an accident guarantee fund would he established. The CIHAIRMAN then moved that a dividend at the rate cf 41. l5s. per cent. per annum be declared, subject to income-tax. This was also carried, It was also resolved 'o consolidate the 201. shares of tbe company into capital stock. The meeting was then made special, and a resolution was passed, approving an agreement for a lease of the Aber. dare \'alley Railway for 10 years. Tho proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the chairman, KENDAL AND WILNDERMERE. An extraordinary general meetingand thehalf-yearlymeeting of this company were held on Tuesday at Kendal, Mr. L. lieyworth in the chair. The report stated that, in consequence of the abstraction of the Kendal goods traffic by the Lancaster acid CarliMle Company, the balance showed the amount of deficiency after payment of bonds and preference shares, but it was believed that the current half-year would more than replaco the deficiency, as vwell as pay interest on the debentures and preference stock. The capital account showed that 229,9701. bad been received, and 228,7521. expended, leaving a balance of 2181. The revenue account for the half-year ending June 30 showed that 4,5301. had been received, and 5,079/. expended, including 1,452/. interest on on honds, and 1,2'./. on preference shares and banking account, leaving a dcficiency of 5491. The C1rAItSIAN explained tbat, in consequence of Mr. Rotheram's award as to the division of traffic aot being understood, it would be necessary to adjourn the two meetings. The award having been read, it appeared that some doubt was attached to the interpretation OT .Mr. Rotheram's expression, " one-thirtieth and thirty-eight decimals," which had been explained to mean one-thirtieth with the addition of thirty-eight one-hundredthsof another thirtieth; but suchan interpretatiou would give a different result from that which the construction at first put upon the award wru'd yield, and the directors felt they could not iP the presenco of this doubt, sanctioned by influential professional men, use the proxies intrumted to them until the legal signification of the phrase was ascertained. A reeolution was passed adjourning the meeting to the 27th inst., and authorizing the directors in the meantime to obtain the beat legal opinion for the information and guidance of the shareholders. The meeting then adjourned. BUCKINGIIAMSII1RE. The half-yearly nneeting of this company was held yesterday at the Enston Station, Sir Rl. Vcrney in the chair. hlr. W. L'JN,t, the secretary, read the reporb, which stated that the balance of dividend unpaid on the 31st of Deceniber last was G041. The rent received from the London and North-Western Railway Company amounted to 24,!1001., making together 25,5041. The payments during the half-year amounted to 291,8-55., leaving a balance of 6-191. The deputation appointed by the proprietors at the last mceting bad an interview with the directors of the London and North-Western Railway Company on the 5th of iMarch last, and strongly urged the construction by the latter company of a now line from the Claydon Junction to join the London and North-Western line near the l*shoey station. The chairman of the London and NorthW\ estern stated that, while he was not prepared to recommend his board to advance any capital for the further extension of the railway, yet, if the local parties interested would find the capital for the extenslon proposed, he had no doubt the London and North-Western Company would bh prepared to work the line on the most favourable terms. 'lheCHAIRiMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said, their receipts were gradually on the increase, which was psrtly to be attributed to traffic from the Oxford and Worcester line, but be expected that when the communication was further extended by the completion and opening of the Worcester and iIereford line a considerable increaso of traflic would be the result. The Hon. P. S. PII IREPONT seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, wbich was carried unanimously. Rosolutic-ns were passed, declaring the dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, and re-electiDg the rotiring directors ard auditors. The proceedings coneluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman. SAL.ISBURY AND YEOVIL. The half-yoarly meeting of this company was held yesterdlay at the otlicts, Leadenhall-street; AMr. J. Chapman in the chair. ¶1he report, an ahstract of which has appeared in Thlc T w,,", was suibmiiitted. The CiI.tlu:l s, in moving tho adoption of the report, stated that the works were proceeding satisfactorily, and it was expected that a portion of tho line, from Salisbury to Gillingluauzi, about 2:1 miles in lengtlh, would be opened for traflic in about 12 months froni the present time. The works oet the line fromii Yeovil to Exeter were advancing rapidly. The Slmerborno Deviation 13ill had recently received the Royal assent, and the works on that deviation would be commenced at an early date. ltesoluitions were unanimously passed,adopting the report, approving and comfirmcing the agreement entered into by the directors with thoe London and South-Western Rtailway C(ompany as explained in articles and supplemental articles of agreement between the two coumpanies, dated the 31st of May, 1856, and o5th of August, 1857, respectively; authorizing and requesting the directors to carry the agreement into effect with such modifications, Hf any, as to them may scem rn iost advantageous for the company. The proceedings then terminated. STOCKPORT, DISLEY, AND WHALEY-BRIDGE, The half-yearly meeting of this comnpany was held yesterday at the ofrices, Le adenhall-street; ;ir. It. R. Notman in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in T'he Tiancs, was taken as read. The C11AIRMAN, in imoving the adoption of the report, conaratulated the proprietors on the opening of the railway to MWhaley-bridge, and stated that the directors were well satisfied with the pa'senger traffic on the line. The goods and mineral traf/ic would be brought on the line early in the ensuing month. The sidings and warehouses were nearly completed for the accommodation of the traffic. It was intended to open the junction with the Cromford and lTigh Peak IRailway on MIonday next. The Bill authorizing the Buxton Extension line had received the Royal assent, and it was expected that the extension line when completed would improve the traffic on the portion of their line already completed and in operation. A resolution adopting the report and statement of accounts was agreed to, and the proceedings terminated. ULSTER. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Belfast on W'ednesday, Mr. W. Coates in the cbair. WRThe report. an abstract of which has appeared in T7he Times, was read. The CHAIRMAN moved a formal resolution adopting the report and declaring a dividend of 30s. per share, less income-tax, being at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, Ar. 1t. W6RI1'1AN Seconded the motion. A long discussion ensued oni the subject of extension lines and in respect to the expense of the opposition in Parliament to the Ae wry and Enuiskillen Bail way 1BiDL It was contended tnat, as the latter company had paid 4,0001. towards the explense of altering the gauge of the Ulster line, they oughtnot to have opposeda Bill renewing the former powers of that conelcony. Mr. AuusNr defended the course adopted by the directors. They had opposed the Newry and Enniskillen Bil with a new to protect the interests of the Ulster Railway shreholders, Ile believed that the Newry Company would regret that they had undertakex the project, a a railway was not required in that direction. Dr. LYNN contended that a line of railway was much needed from Newry to Armagh, and that there were some towns on the route which required railway accommodation. Resolutions wero passed adopting the report, declaring the dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, peor annum for the half -year ending tbe 20th of June, and re-electkig the retiring dihrectors, hIeazr, Gregg, Coates, Riddal, and Dr. The proceodings concludedi with a vote of thanks to the chairman, ____________ CAyrsAL PALAMox-ONE SHuLiwG DAY, Saatri day, Atig. l.-Admissions on p*ynent. 10,245; d&R by wasoe tickets, 1,789; total vistors, 12,034.
STATE OP TRADE. MA.NCHESTER, AUG, 15. There has been very little change in the market since ye,t, rday, but the accounts to hand from Calcutta have led to some inquiry for India fabrics, which are very firm in pJice, niot.itli,tanding the accumulation of stocks. For cleths suited to other mdarkets there is a moderate but steady business, and it is probable that an improved demand will be seon felt in the honie trade as well as from shippars. Wh;le there is no considerable demand for any one branch of cur trade at present, and buyers are regarded as operating vith great caution, yet there is a general business, which id eonsiderable in the aggregate, and which with the great| restriction of production caused by the short tinme movement, Is acting beneficially on prices. In yarns there is a moderate busintss, and spinners are well engaged. Fine yarns, suitable to Russia, continue in request. BIRRIINGHAXI, AUGo, 15. The absence of complaint on the part of niasters and men indicates a healthy state of trade in the iron districts of South Staffordshire. The orders received for the United States have improved, and there has been no giving way in prices. The home demand for some descriptions of manuufacturtd iron, although somewhat dull, is considered better than at the comumeneement of the quarter. The forges and fu-naces of the district are generally in good work, and, although the estreme heat of the weather has impeded employment to some extent the men upon the whole have pursued their avocations with ordinary regulatity. The brass foundry busineFs of the town ard neighbourhood exhibits undoubted signs of improvement. The workshops are busier thani they have been for months past. Both for cast and stamped goods there is an increased demand, as well for the home as the foreign trade. There have been considerable purchases in town during the week from the Italian States, and large orders for almost every description of Birmingham brasefoundry are In course of execution for those countries. According to the representations of some of the principal factors of the town, the country trade is generaly looking up and promises well for the autumn. Several of the largest establishments whose business lies chiefly in the northern counties and Scotland are unusually well off for orders. This is attributed to the present apparent steadineas in the price of metals, the lowness of ironmongers' and Obrazier8' stocs, and the necessity to provide for a winter trade. The chief complaint is still with regard to the demand for tools required for building purposes at home ; hut, notwithstanding, there is still a fair call for heavy steel toys, and the edged-tool manufaeture is very active. The plating trade is described as tolerably good, and that in Britannia metal goods as better than duwing late months. The military gun manufacture continues active, and the test understanding appears to exist between all parties engaged upon the Ordnance orders for the supply of carbines to the Indian army. These are progressing with great rapidity, and large quantities of an excellent quality of arm have already been sent off to the Government depots. Trade in Coventry is unusually brisk. The riband manuz. facture is said to be busier than it has been for many months past, and employnent so abundant that good hands are scarce. At Redditch similar activity prevails among the needle makers. Work is plentiful, and one or two estsa blishments are working overtime. A meeting of the creditors of Sir Charles Fox and Mr Henderson, for the proof of debts, was held in the Birming. ham Court of Bankruptcy yesterday, when application was made by Air. Hughes, solicitor, London, that the judgment given by the French Courts against Fox and Henderson, in the matter of the Napoleon Docks Company' shares, should be made a proof of debt against the bankrupts' estate. This was opposed by the assignees; and ultimately the Comm-ssioner said, in his opinion, the debt was not proveable; but the French party could appeal to a higher court. Mr. Hughes then took the necessary steps for appealing. Various local banking companies have held their annual meetings during the present week. The Birmingham and District Company report that the amount of profit for the year ending the 30th of J une, 1857, was 13,5561. 14s., which, taking into account the sumI paid out for income-tax, equals aproft of 19 per cent. per annum upon the paid up capital o. the company.

NOTTrNGHAM, AUG. 15. There are somo buyors for the home market in the town, but trade generally speaking is dull, not however more so than usual at this period of the year. There has been some inquiry for brown goods and muslins, but in most other branchee trade is quiet. Manufacturers are still wisely abstaining from creating stock at the present high price of silk and cotton, both of which articles continue without alteration. The hosiery trade remains very dull. Buyers for the Canadian market are operating to a smal extent, but otherwise busir.ess is exceedingly quiet. Hosiery, silks, and yarns are without alteration. A very important meeting of merohants and manufacturers, in connexion with the trade of the town, was held a few days ago-its object being the establishment of a direct communication between Nottingham and l'oston. Its advantages were well pointed out by the Mayor, Mr. John Bradley, who stated that " with so great and rapidly increasing a population in the town and neighbourhood the question very natumally arose, how shall the increasing wants of the vast population be supplied? It was quite certain that they could not go westward to draw their supplies thence in a much greater measure than they did at preEent, and they must therefore look for help to the extensive rural district which lay to the eastward. One thing was quite evident-namely, that the Nottingham market was coring very dear, that the rate of provisions was higber than the average of manufacturing towns,and it was therefore a matter of great importance that Nottingham should form as close an alliance and effect as direct a communication as possible with that district which seemed to be best able to supply Its increasing wants. He had heard it fre uently thrown out that there were certain obstacles con.nected with the navigation of Boston which would prevent it ever becoming a place of first-rate importance. But he thought, if it were found that it was a port with which that cla5s of vessels could converiiently trade which brought the prcduce which Nottinghai-'. would chiefly require, and if by means of the prepoacd improvement in the railway commutnicatioii this port could be brought into closer connexion witll Nottinglhain and otber manufacturing and mercantile dlstricts of the country-if this were found to be the case lie thought it would be sufficiently evident that the project was one which would be of considerable importance and advantage not only to Boston but to themselves. At present, if they wished either for business or pleasure to visit the sea, they had to go round to Grimsby, or Scarborough. or Yarmouth, whereas they had all the while a port lying within a distance of 48 miles, with which they haa no communication. What was the reason? Why should they not be brouglt into direct communication with that port? It ,would appear there must have been some verv serious ol-. si acles in the way which prevented it from being done. If there woro not, the sooner they availed themselves of the great advantages which the project seemed to hold out the hetter. Those who had coal to sell or timber to buy would soon find the advantage of having a port so near. Ho b:lieved also that parties who came hither from the continent felt the want of a greater facility of approach to our midland district; that they would often be glad to avoid the inconvenience of going up the Thames, and encountering the bustle of London, and travelling so great a distance through the country before they could arrive at the great markets and manufacturilng towns of the midland district. If the proposed communication were effected, he thought they would often prefer coming direct to the nearest ports by which they could reach the midland district, and having made the circuit of the great manufacturing towns) would then return vid London. He believed he was correct in saying that the rate of provisions at Nottingham in respect to the most import3nt articles of consumption was very high, as compared with the prices of Sleaford and leoston, the difference being 30 or 40 per cent. To open a free and direct communication between the two places must therefore be a manifest benefit to both." A committeo, consisting of the mayor and others, was formed for the purposo of carrying out the project. LEICESTER, AUG. 15. The hosiery trade has this week experienced still further improvement, and there are more orders given out for home consumption; the country trade is nlso more buoyant. Lambs' wool yarns have advanced ls. per lb. Worsted yarns continue firm. IJpon the whole trade is decidedly more healthy. LEEDS, Atm, 15, There are many circumstances at the present time which have a tendency to check the prosperity of the staple trade of this district. The unsettled and unsatisfactory state of the money-market, and the deplorable state of affairs in India and China, have to some extent an injurious effect upon business; while the peculiar aspect of the wool market compas all parties engaged in the woollen Coth trace to acs ilth extreme caution, and very materially curtails operations. Taking these things into considera. tion trade here is still pretty good, and there are no fears that a more critical period will arrivo. During the week there has been a moderate number of buyers in the town, but their object seems to have been more to Inspect than to purchase, the transactions having only been on a limited scale. The export trade has not undergone much noticeable alteration, and several houses are tolerably weU employed. In the manufacturing districts there is, of course, an absence of anything like briskness, but employment is as good as can be expected. To-day the markets at the cloth-hals have been quiet. There was about an average attendacee of mercbants, and biddings were pretty freely made, but the prices offered were such that they were not accepted to any great extent. The weather dunng the week has been very unfavourable for harve stoperatlons, having been wet and unsettled, with frequent heavy showors. To-day, however, a change has taken place; and if next week be fine rnd dry the sickle will soon come into general operation in this neighbourhood, and in all probability wheat will be gathered in good! condition. Should the wool-market become more settled, and flour be at a reasonable price during the ensuing winter, it may fairly be expected that the cloth trade, notwithstanding the other important Circumstances -which have been referred to, wfill continue steady, and there will be no lack of employment. HALIFAX, Aur. 15. The trade of this town may be consldored, upon the whole, to have rather Improved during the week. Fabrics for the home trade have been fairly inquired for, and several Dutoh orders have been receivod for worsted goods. In yarns there has been a moderate business done. The prices of wool have been firmnly maintained, a little advance Itaking place in some oases. t-aking plaw in sonle om BRADFORD, AUG. 15. The worsed-stuff trade, considerod as a whole, is scarcely Eo animated as lately reported. The weather sinoe our last notice having been exceaedingly unpropitious has prevented many buyers from attending our msarkets and in the warcI cues; this circumstance, therefore, coupled with the state (f affairs in the East and the apprehensions entertained with regard to the harvest at home, renders the prospects of our Irade somewhat unsettled from recent expectations and perceptibly limits the present operations. In worsted manufactures there is a quiet and steady bat certainly r,ot extensive business generally transacting, and prices of aU descriptions of stuff fabrics are maintained with firmness. Mlanufatturers are mostly making to order. In the merchants' warehouses sales during the week have been up to the average on comparison with the other departments. Tho yarn branch of our trade shows rather more qi,ittueas, a tocne which perhaps will only be temporary. lhe inquiry, from the limited attendance of manufacturers, is not quite so brisk; yet, in the transactions passing, higher figures are demanded by the spinners than they (o tamed for contracts now delivering. Cotton warps are w:thout mat6r-al change in price, but the business doing in ti.em this week has not been extensive. The wool-market is comparatively flat for the season. Combing wrools only experience a moderate demand for the trae ; staplers, however, adhere to fonrcer rates, w hich are supported with much firmness in sales, especially of the finest bright-haired descriptions. Clothing wvools maintain last M eek's prices, and sales proceed with steadiness. NORM'ICEr, Au&. 15. The manufacturnug trade here has exhibited more activrity during the last fewr weeks, and there are now very fewr good wveavers unemployed. . good deal has been doing in Jacquard fabrics and robes. A new silk mill is being erected in NTorwich, The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday, the 1:3th of August inclusive, were 21,207 against 14,753, last week. BELFAST, AUG. 14, Lmnen.-The Armagh, Lurgan, and Ballymena markets, held since our last, were all of a dnUl and inactivo character, and unless a more lively demand springs up shortly prioces are likely to decline before long. Linen Yarn unaltered, either in price or demand, Flax.-The first sample of new milled flax appeared in the Cookstown market last week. The quality was good, There wr er about 30 tons of dlax in Aughnacloy fair on Wednesday, and about an equal quantity of hand and milled. Should the weather continue favourable, we may expect, in two or three weeks, pretty fair supplies of newz flax; little passing in Dnutch Xlx, whbich, howrever, is still holding firm; in other kinds uothing doing. Three cargoes have arrived this week from Riga, with 3,025 bales or 530 tons, makmng the total qulantity received this season 2,780 tons, Cotton.-The print and dye works in the neighbourhood of 13elfast are busily engaged, and some hold large orders.

Tho weatber at the beginning of the woek was very favonmble for harvest work, and considerable progress was made In wheat-cutting On Thursday,however,it bearme usmsttled, and so severe a storm ga fell upon that day has5 no' blen eXperienced in Nottingham for a number of yearn In the neighbourhood the crops have suffered conaiderably. Deluging iinsa fell from 2 o'clock In the afternoon, with very little Intermrslion, until 11 at night, sweeping all before themn. A great deal of damage was sustalned In the town and much of the corn Ins this district was laid. A lare quantity of rain, ecoompnlid4 with thunder and ligbtulng, feU on Friday; to-day, however It Is fine, and he hopes of the farmer are again raised. Wheat, as respects yield. Is weil spoken of, and from noarly all districts reports are favourable. Around Cotgrave the crop3 are good, and would have been aU housed but for the unsettled weather. In the nelghbourhood of Blidworth he whteat crops are very good; turnips and potatoes look exceedingly healthy; and, indeed, from nearly all parts, accomunt are favourable, and fine weather is now only required for their lngatherlng. As respects tho barley crop, matters are lesn favourable, and although in same instanoes gooad cropa may be seen, on the whole the yield will ba short. The same observations apply to oats, Beans are an uneven crop; in some districts much injury was done at the period of bloomng. Grass is becoming abundant, and turnipa snd mangold have been mprovedby the rains. Potatoes ara free from disease and cheap. Fat stock Is in rather better demand. At Nottingham there was a good show of beats, the trade in which ruled more active than the previous areek, prlme boef making Ss. per stone.

The wheat erop; are good, moro partieularly upon clayey soiUs upon dry in,d3 the crops ere less favouably spoken of. There are complaints among some ,armers that wheat shelding has taken place in some Daris, and, ndeed, this mlght be expected from the rapidity with which It ripened. and the inconvoenenco some farmers osporieuco in procuring a suffliciency of labour. From nearly aU districts, however, reports respecting the yield of wheat ro favourable, and fine weather Is now the only thing rquired to bring the harvost to a satisfactory termip nation. The crops hbave been much laid by the storms Xarly sown barley wiU be a tolerable yield; the late sown, how. ever, :in consequence ot the drought during the growring seaon, aLd the hot forcing weather which pushod it into ear prematurely, wiUl bo a deficient crop. The same may be roe marked of oats, the yield of which wiUl be Indifferent. Be33as are au uneven crop; in some pisoes they have suffered considerably from the blooming having been unfavourable. Peas are also an irre. gular crop. The turnip erop has been greatly Improved by the dne rains of last week; the season has been much too dry for this museul food for stock, but from the late open weatber there wixl be a much better crop than was at one time anticipated.

A fortnight ago there was a prospect of reapintg the finest crop of wheat,eas regards the Quality of the grain, ever cut lin this part of the kindo,m. It is now certain there will not be one single good sample throughout the district.Balyi,i uypoe nmchtoae conditIon sas wheat, And is extensively sProuted, Some Oats had been secured, but the rast are greatly deteriorated. Beanm have also suffered mnuch from the effects of the flaod, Turnips have benefited by It,ex. cept on low gpround, wrhere the plant has been completely submrgMed in which cases the crop wil not be wortha liting. Potatoes wore a splendid crop, hut the rain has iog come at that critical juncture when dry weather is essential to the healthy development of the plank, disease ha. again appeared, and it Is not possible to tell at present how 'much damsage has been done. The wheat trade, under the Influence of the bad weather, has e,hibited more animation this week, and, althouigh prices have in the Masiority of iastances remained as they were last week, sOom of the later markets have experienced anl advance in quotAtionsL Here to-day there was a small show of wheat, all old, and farmers demanded an advance of 3s to lie, per Quarter, but thes rates being unwarranted by the state of the hasrvest Prospects generally, however mauch in accordance with those Of this immediate district, none but n2eediest Purchasers would look at samples, and the imajority of the transactions passing were effected at an enhancement of 2. per lead lie. 4d. per quarter), although as much as 3s. lie, per quarter) was conceded in one or two instances. Oats were not in brisk demand,but holders required more money for them. Beans advanced Gd. per load. (Is. 4d. Per quarter). The foiorving areO the quotatlo?ss -Whcat, 233 to 133. per load of three imperial bushels ; fine, 233, to lOs., blend. corn. 2fs, to 23s. ; beans, 17s, to 21s.; peas, lie. to tic.; oats, 25s. to 27s Per quarter; fine, 2Ss. to 31s. - barley, Sic, to 42s. The cattle trade has been only moderately active, and rates have been rather depressed, HIere to-daY, ink consequence of the flooded stite of mauch of tho Pastur land, both beasts and sheep were a drug, end lower prices had to be taken to effect sales, The weather to-day has been for the moat Part fine and bright Rlain cloudsi have frequently passed overhevad end thunder has beeni ocrasionally heard, but happily there has been no more rain, and these seem to be indfications of more settled weather. WORWICH,4 At7c,sT I5. I The harvest has been vigorously proceeded with in this district whenever field operations have been practicable, but Norfolk and Suffolk have in common with other parts of the kingdom been visited with tempests of more or less severity. The rain fal on the evening of Sunday was .59 inch, on Tuesday -13 Inch, and yesterday St1 inch. The thermometer has varied in the week endirng yesterday from 30 to 7r, dege. Ii Suaffolk the wheat crop Is reported to be very abundant. Slhe yield varies from eight to fifteen coombs Per acre, and it is not considered that any damage has yeot been snstained from the rains In Norfolk the reports vary considerably, hut on the whole they lead to the conclusion that there will be a good average Yield of wheat and a fine crop of barley. The local markets have not varied much, but have generaly exhibited a slightly upward tendency in wheat. At Bnmgay.on Thuarsday, however, prices were In. to is. per qxuarteor lower. HEers to-day the EuPPly was takont off at late rates, but the trade presented a airm ap. pearanee. Ther was little passing in other core, but former Quotations were supporte. The best white wheat (weighing ilib. to 6ilb. Per impertal bushel) realized 6ts, to 67g.,; red, ditto (weighing f01b. to 631b.) 565, to Gs.c per quarter. Inferior descriptions wae re r regular. At the weekly sale of flour at the new mills in this city the supply wras token lft at 40s. 9d. to 41s. per eack, The weather thin afternoon is again rather rainy and dull. Tho cattle-market here to-day exhibited for the time of year a tolerably good show of store hoests, but butyers acte with great caution, andi there was some difficulty in effecting saes At the clcos of the market more than one-fourth the supply remained unsold, hut last wet-k's rates were about maaIntained. A clearance was made of a rather shsort supply of fat beasets. The sheep-pens wrere well filled ; snd the best lamnbs were inquired after ; middling and inferior met, bowever, a. dull sole at folly ls. Per head lowver, without a clearancea being effected. Good keeping: sheep were in demand, hut ewes of all ages met a dull sale. The last importation of eattle into Lowestoft from the ncrth of Europe consisted of 316 oxen and 695 sheeP and lambs. CA.MBRIDGE, AUnGUS 15. The weather has been variablo during the week, and thore have been some heavy atorms. The wheat crop generally is good, Upon tho high land in the tens most of the weat is ct; the yield is tolerably good but the quality of the grain i hardly o fine as could be deired. Upon I he black lands the crop has rather more bulk, which is the caus of its Ieing moro liid. Farmors complain of mildeow. Grain having ripeoed so quickly, farmera had great difficulty in procuring sufflioint hands for the work. From present &Dpenran0es. taking the yield of the country asa whole, tbhwheat crop is good, Barley varier but for tho most part Is an Indifferent crop. Oats will also be under an average. Beans are a vsrlable crop; in many PLaes the pods are small, the weaiher having been too hot at the timo of blooming. Mfangold has greatly Improved sinco the rain, and with seasonable weather a fair crop emay be auttelpated, Potatoes look healthy,but will not be a large crop. They a" free from disease, but the heat and drought until the beginning of this monih were against their growing to a large sire. The pastures arc looking vell. Eddish is growing fast. Dry weather Is now the only thing wianted. Fat stock is without alteration in price. At Ely, with a fair shoow of cattle, prices remained stationary. Sheep wero in moderate supply, mutton seUing at tho same prices a last week. At this corn-market, with a fair supply, fine whitte weat madeo 64., and red 60 per quarter. In other sorts of grain there wag Dot much change. Prioes:-Whito vwheat, 60& to U4s. red, Ss to 6g . oa4t, 2Bg. to 32a.; beans, 4is. to 48s. per quarter. At Ely the wheat trade was firm, at last week's prioes. In spring eorn there was no alteration. At St Ives, with a moderate supply of now wheat, prices were ts. tower than last wvek. Old wheat in limited supply, and fully as dear as last week. In spring corn there was no alteration.

Since our last report the reatber has undergone such a chanlge as sadly to blIght the cheering prospects wbich a fortnight szo the cornfields presented, Oa Thursday and:Friday there were heavy themdar etorms, the lightning was intensely vivid and incessant. The ratl roured do-n in torrents, and on, Friday afternoon a great deal of hail tell, especially Inthe ditrict of Norsh Hampshire. A great deal of wheat wa, standung in sbeaves, and the barler, in mrot placoe, ra' uw cut. The hail fell with ouch intensityas to do a very consldeesble amount of damane both to the cut and uncut corn. In some fields the eas of the wheat were thoroughly thrashed, and the corn waiting for tho Eickle has boen sadly beaten down, Altogether the storms have prove1 move destractive than known for s'me yearn, We hove baeu informed that some of the farmers will be reimbursed for the damage, ag they aye connected with the modern hall insurancel ofiloes. Though tbere has been this drawback to.the worth of the harrte* it Is an uoquestionabhe fast that a large quantity of wheat habs bee housed in very good condition. The turnIpS, mangold wurtzel, and otber roo crops have wonderfulLyImp.oved with the raln. Our suppUes of wheat were rather ehort to-day, the late wet 'avulng prevented farmers thrasbing either old or new. At Lirerpol and Mark-lane on Friday the trade underwent an alteration entirely iS conseluenoe oftheunsettled weather having puts check to field opc rations Factors begau by saking higher prices than last week both for the old and new wheat. Though the stocks of the mealmen:sre much re duced, and of late they hare purhbased only spainugly to meet immediato wants. in anticiPation of a downuard tendency in the flour market, they were not disposed to-day to yield to the demands msde4 by sellers Trade moved on sluggishly in the former pact of the dar. and when sales were effected the rates were about is to s. over lat week' for eld wheat. Prime and picked parcels of new were taken off at about sa much money as tbhi day ae'nnight, hbut terms were unques. tionably lower for the infecior arcels. A few flue lotis of new sold at 71a.; ordinary runs of white wheat, 60s. to 66s.; secondary, 62si. to 6O9Red wbea1t, now, best sorts, 6SAD to 64s.: fnnerior, S6s. to 60.

Prlcs for four remain stationary-numely, 40 for households and 45. for secondc. The check given to harveat work has led to an Improved tone sn most of the country markets. On Monday, at Abingdon, the trade vsw slow, but prices quite as dear as previously. On Tueday. at Alton, but ittle business could be done unles at former cyrencles. On Wednes. day, at liaringstoke, there ws a good supply of wheat, which moved off at prices the sme as previously were current. At lIungerforoS, om that day, the trade wa8 firm; new wheat sold at 62s. to 66a. On tba eame day, at Wantage, hat week's quotatonrs Were reallzecL On Thursday, t Newbury, the demand was active, and prioes were I. to 2-, dearer; tome fine new wheat fetched i7n, At Een1ey-o=-ThbAmMs etn that day, wheat was taken off alowly at terms sarcely so good as last week. On Friday. at Wallingford, there was an improved demand, and prtces ruled Is. to 2s. higher. ROOCEST , AUoGrr 15. Ailthough a considerable quantity ot rain has fallen, it Si not anticlpated that any very great harm will be done to the wheat whioh hba been cut, as fortunatoly the great bulk of tho crop had been secured P splendid oondition. Harveat-work, which has been auspended In cousequence of the unsettled Este of the weather, is again resumed, and It is expected that by the endof next week nearly the whele of theoare in the western division of the county will hare been housed. E verywhere in the county the most favourable reports are roceived of tho excellent ySela of wheat and oats, but In maDy distriict barley wi t nit give so large a crop as wa8 at first anticipated. Thls is masluly to b. accounted for from the excessive drooght which occurred in the spring and early smmmer months. The hop plant has derived very great benefit from the late rains, andl planters aretmuch more sanguine ot obtaining acrop, though thereis no doubt that the yield wil faU very sbort of an average. AroundI Maidstone and Canterbury, hich are the principal hop growing dis. iNs , the nlant has muchlimproved, and some of the best grounds pro. raie to yield 17 to 1 c wt. Per acre; thb averare bowever will_p. bably not exceed 6 to 9 owt. The duty iS steadlly advancing, and IS now called at from ;C25,000 to J130,000. At this omr exdcange there were some splendid samples of new wheat placed on the stands, one parcel ot white giving the almost unprecedented weight of 66lb. to the busheL The market wasbut moderately supplied, and the continued favourable reports of the stata of the harrest prerented any ImProvement on last week's rates, seUerq adopting a more subdoed tone, The prices otfold wheat were about the ame a aslati wesir, but new has given way from ls, to 2a., and event at that concosclon on the part of holders trade was dulL Barley wax rather mere inquired after, and remained steady. The demand foe oats was lews active, owlng to the large arrivals from abroad- The following were the prices at tho does of the market:-White wheat, 60O. to 64a.; fine, 66a.; red ditto, -4s, to 5-Is,; fins, 60a. ; barley, 366. to 32-. oats, 24& to 22&. The highly favourable rePorts from the wheat-growing dlEtrSt have had a depressing nfluence on nearly aU the local markete. At MYAdstnoe, with a fair supplyof uene- wheat of good quality. prices were about is. liess. Good samples of barley were firmL At Tunbrldge Welts prices were 2s. cheaper, but at fisndwich thera was no alterallon. At Westerham. to effect tales, holders had to submit to a reduction of about 2n, per quarter on both white and redL Maidsto.e great stock-market on Tuesday was not weU suppUed, and only a smaUl amount of busines was transacted at formeg rates. GRANTHIAIh, ArGsr 15. There were some very heavy storms at the latter Dsrt of the week, To-day the weather Is f ne. Harvost work has been delayed, the weather having been very ufavourable, The heavy storms hare laid extensive tracts of land under water, the wheat in sheaf belig covered as high as the bands.

LONDON, MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 1857. The House of Commons sat for a short time on Saturday in order to forward eertain Bills their respective stages. On the order for committing the Militia Bill, Mr. STAFFOrD made some remarks upon the subjects of enlistment for the army, and the clothing and comfort of the soldiers. Othur matters incidental and not incidentalto the Bills under consideration were touched upon. The Crowded Dwellings Prevention Bill underwent some discussion before its committal was deferred until Monday. The House adjourned at 2 o'clock.
*WhIien economy has been practised as a virtue it soon becomes a pleasure, and expenditure a pain. How disgustine, to pay for what we do not actually use ! It is the triumph of economy to spare ourselves this pain, and only to pay for what we use and get the fulll profit of. This is that satisfactory " pennyiwortlh" w-hich is the chief earthly consolation of many reetpectable persous, causing pleasant dreams, quirt coasciences, cheerful thoughis, and tranquil countenances. The horse that is eating his head off in the stable disturbs this equilibrium, and becomes a secret sore, festering in a domestic economist's mind. Sell it imnedliately, and save the expense of itskeep. But in another month you may want to use it again, and you will then regret that you parted with it, for no man not of tho horsedealing mystery and guild ever makles a change in his stud without loss. Ylour house is a trouble to you when you go abroad or go to the seaside for the summer, the expenses of the servants and the gardener's wages going on all the same in your absence. Nevertheless, you must keep your house and garden going, because you want to return to them. After all, then, you must sometimes submit to the guilt of a reluctant extravagance. You must bear the pain and remorse of it philosophicaUy, and not, in a moment of orthodox horror of waste, turn off house, horse, servants, and gardener, and stand alone with your carpet bag in the wide world. It may be delightful at first to feel that you are paying no taxes, no rent, and no wages, but this happy froodom will htavo to bo atollae for by a good doal of subsoluont inconvenienlce. Such is this country's oeonollly witlh re1ctl)pot to its army. Wo want to havo an armly tlxaitly wli,l'l tihore is a ILu0 for it, aid immndiateily the) mmtl In over to be witlhlut ollo. it la no ulpleasant1ut to pay for what wo dou't nctualllly is). if wvo only got our pennywoortli, howovor costly a olno it nay bo-oven if it is a Crimeaon poninywvortl-wo aro satisfied. Wo have then a taLnigiblo quid pro qIuo. But wo canLniot boar to have ai army eating itit head off. Lot it spring full armied out of the oarth whon wo wanit it, anm wo wiiU pay it well, bUt tllhei let it go undorground againL iiiuiediately, and not como up till wo wanit it againi. Wero wo undergoiUIg perpOtuUl invasion froImi J11LIUS C.F:SAI or BO.NAI'AI1TE wO shlould koep ani armiiy with pleasuro, and not grudgo it tho bcet pay, but it is hard to ilesh and blood to have to pay for an army in time of peace. IIre. is the soro into wvhich Lord ELLEN'oloU(uIf poked rather uncereinoniously and cruelUy on Friday night. About once in foiur years we wavnt to have a good army. There is some misunadrstanding with a foreign Power ; things look awkwrard, anid a war threatens. In 1854 a war did break out, and then, of course, we immediately vwished that we had a good aray ; but we had not got one, audl wo had trouble enough to make one. In 1848 we were in alarm. Europe was convulsed from one end to the other; our neighbours across the Channel had a new Government, which we did not know what to think of; no one could tell what might happen, and then wve wished we had a good army. In 1844, though, as Lord ELLrnoROuGx says, both countries were presided over by the most peaceful Governments,-though France liad GtTIzoT for its Prime Minister and England Sir ROBERT PEEL,-"a miserable island in the Pacific" in I a moment upset the balance, and threatened to set us together by the ears-and t1en, too, wo wished we had a good army. Our relations, too, withi America were so very unsteady about that time, that Lord ELLENBOROUGHC;1 tells us, " with the exception of " Lord ABERDEEN, there was not a man in the "Cabinet who did not think we should have "war." In 1840 India, France, Syria, and China together cloudedourhorizon, and then, too, we shouldj have been right glad to have a good army. And now again,-to come back to the date from which we started,-it is between three and four years! since the commencement of the Russian War, and we have an Indian Mutiny, and at tlis moment, too, we wish we had a good army. But what is the state of the case? According to Lord ELLExNBOROUeH the efforts absolutely necessary to recover India leave us almost de- I fenceless at home. WVe have now 38,000 fewer l armed men in this country than we had during i the Crimean war, and that when, on all ordinary rules, we are much more exposed to European attack than we were then ; for, however much the i Crimean alliance gave us to do in the East of Europe, that very alliance protected us completely in the West, whereas now we are thrown back upon ourselves again, and have only our own army to depend on, and our ordinary relations with our neighbours on which to rely. It is true we have ten x:aore battalions of the Line or 8,000 more regulars at home now than we had then ; but, whereas then we had 55,000 Militia, we have now only 9,000, and those only pledged to us for six months, for the grant of 200,0001. will not keep them longer. But such a force, if inadequate for self-defence, is still less sufficient as a basis of reinforcement to our troops in India. Lord ELLNBoRoUGIr calculates that the QuEEN's troops and the Company's troops together in India will need reinforcement at the rate of 15,000 annually, taking all the casualties of climate and war into account. But where is this reinforcement to comefrom ? Why, one year, upon this calculation, will swallow up the greater part of the whole army at home, regular and Militia too, which united only amount to some 25,000. Does not this sudden periodical call for soldiers, this costly and undignified hurry every four or five years to arm ourselves and prepare for some emergency, inculcate at last the lesson that we want a better standing army than we have ? Must we not sooner or later make up our minds to this? We think every fresh occasion for troops that arises will be the last, that we shall never want an army again, and that our neighbours will alwaya be friendly, as now. Between 1848 and 1854 war was more than once possible. Then the Russian NVar came, but that would certainly be the very last. Now an Indian Mutiny has come, and that, we seern to fancy, will be, when it is quelled, the very last Mutiny that will ever happen. But do not these facts, taking place one after anotaer, amount to a law, and, if we somehow or other always find ourselves in a great self-protective hurry every four or five years, and getting together an army by hook or by crook, may we not as well assume these data as fixed ones, and act upon them by keeping a sufficient army by us ? It may not be wanted at this very moment, but we know of a law of events according to which the country has a want of an arnmy at certain intervals. Then, why not acquiesce in this law and anticipate events ? Why not recognize the fact that we have a great Emupire, and must keep it? A great Empire implies many causes of disturbance at work, and we must be prepared not only for a normal, but for an extraordinary, state of things. We look around us now in vain for somie remnants of our Crimean force. They are all gone. The Foreign Legion is just disbanded, pan. of which would have been very useful in India; 2,000 artillery are disbanded; they would ha\ve been invaluable in India; 30,000 of the Line are disbanded, and seamen in great numbers. The pressure is now for soldiers at any price, and not a seaman can be got. But Lord JohNi RUSSELL and MIr. GLAT>sToxE would not allow any reinanets. Reduction was forced at all cost on the last Parliament, and these two statesmen ran a race for the prize of economical 1 popularity. ;-t is, of course, an easy argument at the tiue, 'jut we question whether the Indian Mutiny ratifies it.
The recent Act of the Legislative Council of India for the restraint of the Press has naturally excited strong feelings of irritation at Calcutta; but in a crisis like the present a Government can scarcely be armed with excessive powers. Those who are responsible for the preservation of the Empire must necessarily be trusted to define the conditions under which they can undertake to accomplish their task. As far as the measure applies to the vernacular journals, it is only surprising th.. they should have been so long permitted to propagate sedition and revolt. Some of the officers of regiments who have hitherto remained true to their standards have been repeatedly informed by their native subordinates that it was impossible to answer for the fidelity of the men, unless the native newspapers were prohibited from puiblishing incentives to mutiny. No Government worthy of the name could in the presence of an armed rebellion allow the organs of disaffection to enjoy a liberty which was at all times anomalous. The extension of the same measures of precaution to the Anglo-Indian Press cannot have implied any doubt in the loyalty of the European community. It is natural that the zealous advocates of English supremacy should resent the apparent dis- pOltiQul t idloeitify them with the native journallntU, wV1hozz lthly uttorly despise and distrust ; but dliflIvrof, roalsonn might oqually juatify the Governmotit in anisumsing a right of suporvision over the loyttl portion of tho Pross. Good faith offers no guarititoo for prudence, and among the merits of lialiuti now,upaperul discretion has never been pro ounjieiont. Tho journals of Calcutta and of the provuicial capitals are filled with correspondence from rogimiental oflicors and from the younger nitviiluin of tho civil service, and it is not isurprising that a large portion of their columns il tillod witlh consures on persons high in ollico. Tho gossip of all professions consists in : great measure of grumbling. Clergymen always abuso bishops; lawyers frequently critiCi7. judges; but soldiers and civil servants still more universally delight in finding fault with thoir superiors. At home military are more personal even than religious journals, and ia the dulness of an Indian station a libel is far more exciting than a dissertation on the principles of public policy. It is true that journalism is of itself a profession, and for that very reason it is qualified to exercise a dispassionate judgment on questions wvith which it has no immediate connexion, but the great body of contributors to the Indian journals write for the public as amateurs on subjects in which they have a professional bias. The readers -whom they address may be com2petent to correct thGir exaggerations and to make use of their more valuable suggestions ; but there is another audience listening, and it cannot be excluded. To the natives, even of the more intelligent classes, the governing race appears as a whole, and the charges brought by Englishmen against English functionaries are accepted as admissions of misconduct. The difference of language makes it easy to circulate inflammatory passages, and to suppress all statements which might operate as correctives. Among ourselves it is found that free discussion tends eventually to the elimination of truth; but it is dangerous to hold a coincil of war in the presence of an enemy. Five and forty years ago Sir T. MINano, in a minute on the freedom of the Press in India, formed the most melancholy forebcdings of its probable effects on the native army. Free from any prejudice in favour of irresponsible government, he was also exempt from ilusions. He thoughlt it idle to forget the fact that the English were a handful of strangers, ruling a population which with the spread of intelligence must gradually become desirous of independence. It ought to be tho object of Anglo-Indian statesmen to prolong the continuance of our tenure to the utmost, and finally to leave behind us the elements of a regular and civilized government. Sir T. Mux;Ro came to the conclusion that the free Press would destroy the allegiance of the army before education could diffuse itself among the great body of the people. He considered that the danger was then distant, but that it must inevitably follow on the adoption of the measure which he deprecated. In conclusion, he entreated the Court of Directors to view the question as one of the most important which ever came before them. His warnings, confirmed by recent experience, may vell suggest the prudence of a permanent provision against the excesses of the native Press. The case of the English journals is distinct, and there can be no doubt that in ordinary times they will resume the privileges which they have long enjoyed. Their complaints of the recent interference with their freedom will scarcely be adopted in England -without qualification. It is not enough to say, or even to say with truth, that the Press is unanimously loyal, that it has leen of late exceptionally prudent, and that public criticism is a stimulus to the effective discharge of oflicial duties. If the censorship is properly exercised, discretion and good faith will afford a perfect security against interference, and a prudent and equitable use of the powers conferred by the Act of Legislative Council will probably do much to cahn the excitement which prevails among those who are affected by its provisions. The first exercise of the censorship at the expense of the Friend of Iiudia appears to have been highly questionable. Two paragraphs in an essay on the centenary anniversary of Plassy are declared to be " in the judgment of the GovERNOR- GENERAL in Council fraught with mischief, and " calculated at the present time to spread disaffec"tion towards the British Government, both among " its native subjects and among dependent and allied "States." If retaliationwere possible, thejournalist might reply that the official censure is itself far more liable to misrepresentation, as inclicating undue suseeptibility to alarm. The obnoxious article contains a spirited defence of English rule in India against the imputations to which it has been frequently subjected. The portions which are specially denounced consist of a vindication of tbe policy -which has elevated the native community, although " it may be alleged against us that we have deposedl the Kings and ruined the nobles of India." As the vwriter truly says, " Had Princes "and Rajahs in Hlindostan been worth conserving they would have retained their titles and power. The class speedily die out in the natural course of mortality, and it is not for the benefit of society that it should be renewed." On the cther hand, it is asserted that " for every anna " which we have taken from the noble we have " returned a rupee to the trader ;" but the suspicion of the censor was perhaps chiefly excited by the hope with which the article closes, that " the second cen"tenary of Plassy may be celebrated in Bengal by "a respected Government and a Christian popula"tion." A prophecy which assigns 100 years for its own fulfilment will scarcely excite any immediate uneasiness among the natives. Dependent Princes and States have long since been fully aware that many Kings have been deposed during the creation of our empire. The official notification will add a meaning to passages which night never bave attracted notice; and the censure will seem to have been called forth rather by an imprudent avowal of the truth than by a misrepresentation of the intentions of the Government. English functionaries are naturaUy awkward in dealing with the novelty of a censorship, but the present crisis will admit of no error in judgment.
Time was when it was reckoned a usefull work to draw a picture of a " Patriot King ;" it is now the day of the " Patriot Shareholder." Since the publication of that sketch or treatise tho aspect of human affairs has changed. Railway responsibilities have taken the place of dynastic disputes. We have very serious doubts if personal attachment to such a worthless Sovereign as the Second JAMES would now seriously disquiet tho equanimity of the Empire for ton days. It becoz-aes, however, a more serious matter when the dividend upon the stock of a particular railway, which estimates it by millions sterling, drops from 8 per cent. to 1 per cent. Such has been the case of the Great Western Railway; but, surprising as is this result, .t is still more surprising that the shareholders of the Company should be of opinion that the gentlemen under whose auspices such a result has been produced are worthy of honour and reward. Doubtless the instance of that old General who was I thanked by the Parliamentary majority of those days for not having given way to despair when he had just been signally defeated was present to the minds of the Great Western shareholders when, at Bristol on Friday last, they voted for the renewed employment and additional reward of Mlessrs. Z rUzL and SAUNDERS. We, of ^ourse, who are not Great WVestern shareholders, but who simply represent the puhlic and the passengers by the line, would appear at firsi sight to have nothing to do with the matter beyonA that of sounding a trumpet in honour of these illusti-ious citizens. A moment's consideration, however, w.,1l show that the interests of passengers by the line, an,d of the public generally, are inextricably bound up with the correct management of railway undertakings. Not only are our interests directly involved in the matter, but we have an absolute right to be heard, inasmuch as a virtual monopoly of the traffic throughout the district occupied by any railway company has been handed over to them by the Parliament, which represents the community. It is not as in the old coaching days, when every coach proprietor was heartily welcome to ruin himself, if such was his own pleasure. There were the turnpike roads open to aU alike. Half a dozen rival concerns were at any tine to be found running their vehicles along the main roads, and the public had no more right to interfere with their proceedings than to intervene in the disputes between antagonist haberdashers. Not so in the case of railway mismanagement. It would undoubtedly be right to put a limit to the gains of these great monopolists,if byany unexpected revolution in their affairs it became clear that they were making undue profits by surcharging the public. Now, as consequences almost equally unpleasant result from the reduction of their profits when such reduction is due to over-expenditure and general mismanagement, it would seem to follow that we have at least the right of remonstrance. We do not desire to send a tribune as plenipotentiary for the public to the meetings of the shareholders, or to influence their decisions in any more direct wray than by the action of public opinion; but so far we are clearly justified. The other day we showed how the interests of the unfortunate shareholders not directly concerned with the management had been damaged by the rash and unadvised policy of the Chairman and Directors of the Great Western Company; we now assert that, equaUy in point of principle, although it may be to a less degree in amount, the interests of the public-at least, of all persons who use the line-are injtured by a result which is expressed by the dividend of 1 per cent. How has the mischief arisen? There is really no mystery in the matter. The answer may be given in the old railway formula-" The branches " have sapped the trunk." The only way in which the mischief can be repaired, after a careful reduction of the working expenses upon the branches to their miniminn, is to make the trunk line pay the difference. It may weU be that at this particular moment-or, indeed, at any particular moment-the Directors might point to their tariff and say, " We have not increased our " tolls." True; but the dividend is at 1 per cent. Now, if it be desired to restore the equilibrium between incomings and outgoings-including, of course, a reasonable dividend to the shareholdersthere is no other way of producing such a result than by causing the trunk line to pay for the branches. In other words, every passenger who uses the rail between London and Bristol, or who forwards a bale of goods between those two points, must pay more than he should pay of right, in order that the persons for whose conv. enience the branches have been constructed should pay less; the vast majority of the public, that is, must pay for a smaU and insignificant miinority. The very same causes which have depreciated the annual dividend operate, or must ultimately operate, with full effect upon the general rates of toll along the main line. Tho old story, of course, is, that although the expenditure is immediate the depreciation is temporary, inasmuch as sources of wealth have been tapped which have not yet had time to pour forth their golden streams. For the last 12 years w-e have been in the habit of hearing this assertion uttered, and renewed as often as railway management has been challenged: our answer is,-look at the resuilts. Ample time has been given for the verification of the assertion, if it rested upon a sotund basis, but what is the amount of dividend generally upon railway undertakings? The profit upon ordinary railway shares is far below the rate of profit received from capitalembarkedin any other form of industrial concern. Such is the nature of the proof upon our side ; on the other we find nothing but vague prognostications of halcyon days for the shareholders in an uncertain fature. The present generation of shareholders and the present generation of passengers must suffer for the benefit of shareholders and passengers in the year 1900. It might, or it might not be for the benefit of their posterity, if the Englishmen of A.D. 1S57 were to unite their effbrts for the extinction of the National Debt; but at least it would be a little hard to impose upon us the ftilfilment of such a task. In the particular case of the Great WVestern there may have been, we believe there has been, an undue expendituire upon engineering, upon the construction of magnificent stations where smalUer ones would have sufliced, aud upon other matters of this description. The real and main cause, however, of the present uncomfortable relations between capital and profits upon the Great Western line is, that the Directors have extended the ramifications of their concern without consideration for the interests of those persons whose interests they were bounid to protect. It may very well be that if they had not pushed their applications through Parliament independent or rival companies might have secured a temporary footing upon that which they are pleased to consider their especial coumtry. The result, hovever, would seem to show, that if they had quietly looked on while others were ruining themselves, and bought up the lies from time to time at a depreciation, they would better have promoted 'he welfare of their own undertaking. If these branches are fatal to the prosperity even of so gigantic a concern as the Great Western, what would have been the result in the hands of Boards who had not the millions of the Great W estern to fall back upon! Great capitalists in other departments of commerce appear to understand the working and effect of this coldblooded but necessary policy; in railway concerns alone we find the steeplechase spirit to be paramcount, and that wild enthusiasm vwhich shuts its eyes to conse(luences for the sake of temporary success. Nor are the shareholders entirely free from blame in this matter. We understand well the difficulties of their position, and can thoroughly appreciate the fact that aniy individual member of a body nominally paramount may be in point of fact quite powerless when he endeavours to act against an organization which is at least strong enough at any time to crush hit)l. The whole history of railways in this coiuntry is a mere record of the inefficiency of the proprietary bodies. Why should this be, for in this country also we find the great fact that the executive Government is kept substantiaUy under the control of a Parliamientary majority ? The real catuse-at least, one of the principal causes-is, that the Directors and the proplietors are so seldom brought face to face, and when they do meet it is for so short a period, tbat no private proprietor has either time or opportunity to gain the ear of the assembly. There is ! no " Opposition." If any man is bold enough to challenge the proceedings of the Board, he is sneered down or bullied. All necessary measures have been taken for securing a favourable decision upon one side-no single measure has been taken upon the other, Since the machinery of "audits" IM onfessedly turneq o4ut a mere delusion, and since railway companies will not brook any control from without, might not inore frequent meetings between the Director and their constituents be attended with beneficial effect t The shareholders who were really inclined to es 7r cise a strenuous superviaion over the proceedings of their executive officers before irreparable mis. chief was done would thus have an oppor. tunity of becoming better acquainted with each other, and of ascertaining who among them was best qualified by natural aptitude and acquired habits of business for taking a lead against the Directorn whenever they wera inclined to go astray. Had the Treasury Bench -that is, the Board of Directors-of the Great Western been thus kept under the constaut control of an Opposition, it would have been most improbable that the dividend upon the line would ever have been reduced to 1 per cent., and wa think it impossible that a sam of 5,00(r1. should have been voted to the Secretary, -who at least was a prominent officer of the Company throughout the proceedings which have resulted in so lamentable a depreciation of their property. Could we divest ourselves of the painful consciousness that many a head which was already low enough has been brought still lower by the policy which the Directors of this concern have too long pursued, we should be inclined rather to smile at their proceedings than to make them the subject of serious remark. Were not the interesta of their co-proprietors and of the general public involved in their decisions, we know not why a patriotic body of men should not unite together for the praiseworthy object of presenting their country with a handsome railway constructed upon the broad-gauge principle, ragardless of expense. As individuals, we rejoice to see foreigners at the Paddington Terminus, and enjoy their astonishment at the aspect of that magnificent shed. IJnless their relatives and their heirs-at law should interfere by commissions of lunacy or otherwise, we know not that strangers to the operation would have anything better to do than to subscribe for a testimonial to the patriotic citizens who devote the surplus of their property to carrying out so stupendous an undertaking at their own proper cost. UTnder such circumstances, the erection of a statue to Mr. BFL--Nm at one end of the line, and to Mr. SAUNDERS at the other, would be both intelligible and appropriate. We would suggest as an addition the erection of an obelisk at Paddington, inscribed in golden letters with the names of tha virtuous citizens who had, from the purest and most disinterested motives, presented the nation with such a gift as the Great Western Railway !
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I observe in a very respectable weekly newspaper a statement which I know to be incorrect, and which may have injurious consequences if not immediatelycontradicted. InanarticleonLordCampbell's Bill for checking the sale of obscene publications it is represented that the author of the Bill classel in this category La Danme aux Catia,s. Having been present in the House of Lords on the occasion referred to, I can positively assert that the writeu of the article must have been nmisinformed with respect to what Lord Campbell then said. Instead of pointing out this play of Dumas, from which the opera of La Traviata is taken, as an obscene publication to be prosecuted or summarily seized and destroyed, he declared that, notwithstanding indelicacies to be found in it, as in the signal given by the red or white camelia, it belonged to a class of publications which the law could not reach, and the sale, purchase, and perusal of wlhich must be left to every man and woman's taste and sense of propriety. His Lordship produced a copy of La Damie a,?x Camglia.s, said to have been bought at a railway station, for the purpose of showing to the Peers an advertisement of many pages appended to it containing a list of above one hundred most abominable books with coloured illustrations, several of which had been made the subject of prosecution by indictment, and which juries had at once pronounced to be revoltingly obscene, the advertiser givin his name and number in Holywvell-street, and promising that, on the price of any one of these books being remitted to him in stamps, a copy should be faithfully sent by post to any part of the united kingdom.

SotrHA)PTOYX, Saturday.-The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Candia, Captain Brown, left this afternoon for Iodia, rih the Cape, carrying out about IGO passengers, nearly all of whom are officers returning to service with their respective regimeDnt, and a small cargo.

TnF BrRLlAACiS AiENDMIEiT BrLL.-We rejoice to see that this much-needed measure has passed through committee in their Lordehips? House without any material injury. All the efforts of the "Lords Spiritual" (who might fiud enough to do in their sees vwithout impeding just legislation) failed to induce the Government to abandon the clause which authorizes the clergy to act, if thev choose, prior to consecration; thoughan amendmuentreqniring that an application for tho rite should first be nmade, was agreed to. Equally unsuocesful was an attempt by the wily Bishop of Oxford to introdiuce a clause (drawn up, we regret to see, by the Bishop of London) for erforcing what he codan e squality of charges, but which he weU k-new would establish great practical injuitice. Thongh we have more than once explained this point, the importance of the principle involved reqnires that it should agaia De made clear. The Crown Isayers and otbEr eminent authorities have over and over again decided that the existing Acte require she burial boards to make their orn- chargces-i a., those for the general expenses of each cenieter.y-qual in consecrated and nnconsecrated ground; leaving ecclesiastical fees tv be settled betwreen the parties. That is real equality. And, to prevent litigation, clauses by Mr. Dillvwyn, have eniho lied it muore clearly in the Bill before Parliament. Tbe e,tablished clergy, too. as servants of the State, have a legal claimii to moderate fees, which thus serves as a compensation for the transference of their interments from churchyards to coemeteries. The juggle attempted with almost every burial board has been to induce it to add these clerical fees to the boakd charges for burials in consecrated ground, and then to charge a sum equal to the two combined f'r burials In unconsecrateed ground. This is the pretended equality whioh the Bishop of Oxford would have set up, and would thus have rendered the law on the subject far worse than it is at precent, by introducing an oppressive Drindple which (whatever its want of clearness) it docs not now contain. And this is coolly advocated on the gronn(I that without such regulation the consecrated cannot " compete"' with the unconsecrated ground, sinea the latter will be cheapest. Disenting ministers, as the advocates of this arrangement, are well awaro, not being in the habit of charging for their attendance at funerals. The Government deserve the warmthanks of enlightened Church. men and Nonconformists for so spiritedly defending their rights against the powerful assaults of an oppressive hierarchy, and Earl GranvUle's rebuke of the offensive tone of the Bishop of Oxford did him great credit. A little more perseverance will secure the final safety of the BilL -Lccds Mcrcu,ry. SALE OF PoisoN-3 Bil.L.-This Bill, as amenidec by the select committee of the House of Lords, has been printed.

THE INDIAN MUTIN I ES. We have already explained how til overlaed Mails from Bombay anI Calcutta havig- buen sent from Alexandria by ditrerent steannhdi,.e, that from Calcutta, though it was dospatched 1b-t, arrived first r 8re;lles, and consequently in Lod don. By thTs mail neither the (0overnment i) *r t1e India Hoseo received an*y 1-lligelce ir.otn'o;y and their dates from CalclUta rea1,;l;-l t_illv to the 4th ult,, whereas those from Bomba3 were to the 14th. Fortunately, our agent at AI,xanidi ii, with snost praiseworthy caution, sent us a eopy of the Bortlnkn Tiews by the steamer hllichI carried the Caleutta mail, although the * hole ItousWsy niail had been despatched sever.l hours before, and it was this single copy which enabled us on Friday to give our readers later intelligence by ten days than had reached eithier the (.nvernj ment or the India hlouse. The 1Bomnbay niail has since arrived, the slow steamer to hiill it was intrusted having been left far behind by that which carried the Calcutta mail, and we are no.w enabled to publish the letter of our Bombay c Xlrespondent, wlhich, notwithstalldilng its detentioni, will be found most interesting, as couveying the best sulmmary of the details of the insurrection. It is dated Bombay, July 14:- " If you recollect wbhat I :wrote in my last letter of the strength and extent of the city of Delhi, of the numbers and resources of the rebels, of the coinparative smallness of the force brought againist them, and of the conseqient necessity of postponing an attack till reinforcements in considerable strengthl should have arrived, you will be prepared to learn that no news has yet reached us of the capture and demolition of this great stronghold of revolt. MIuch, Indeed, may have happened, and I am disposed to think has happened, since the date of our latent zntelligence from the camp. Tidings of the progress of events reach us but slowly, for as I mentioned the other day, the direct eornmunication hetween this and Agra being interrupted,wc are depeindent upoin commuunication; froni Lahore, to which city the telegr;ph is at work from the canmp, but from which letters are 10 or 12 days getting to uc. Thuts we have nothing from Delhi later than the 27th or 28th of last month. But wo learn from various points of the Punjal, that at that date reinforcements of troolps of all arms were rapidly converging upon Delhi. 13y the end of the month the General expecte.l to lind himself strengthened by fully 3,;0( men, including the 8th Foot and a wing of the Glst, a troop and two batteries of Artil lery, and some Puniijab anid other Irregulars, horse and foot. Within a week or ten days from his receiving this augiumeniUationi to his force- that is to say, in all probability two or three days ago-hwould, it is believed, deliver tbe grand assault. No regular approaches had been, or would be made, there has not been strenigth enough for that; the affa'r would, I am credibly informed, he managedI by blowing open a gate andl entering, at the point of the bayonet. l3ut come wihern and how it might, I know that at the date of the latest accounts from the camp those bpst qualified to judge entertained not a doubt that tho assault wouild be successful. Ouhr men, both Europeans and natives, thongh haKrd worked, were well and In capital spirits, while the pluck of tho mutineels was evidently ou the wane. Their attacks which, as we shall see presently, were at first of almost daily oceurrence, and were conducted with great determtnationi anid perseverance, had become rare and fechle. Nor does this show only tl:at the flarne of their enthusiasm is dying out,-it may bo taken, I thinlk, as estalblishing the fact that they had not *been reinforced of late by other bands of mutineers to any considerable extent. Most of the earlier attacks wero doubtle3s conducted by successivo fresh arrivals, eager for the fray, and as yet lacking the experience wvhichl their beaten comrades had dearly bought. The feebleness of the latest (lemonstration from the city would seen to show that that bitter lesson hu(d been learnt by the whole mass of the rebel soltliery congregated within it. "But tO give yoll shortly details of the progress of the siege, if sivge it may be strictly called, so far as they have reached us:-On the 8thi of June it was, as you are aware, that General Barnard advancing upon Delhi by the Kurniaul road, carried one after anjotber the fortified positions of the mutineers, and drove them within the walls of the city. The first of these pOsitiolis vTas tho strongest, and th;rethe principal loss of the day was sustained, fallin'g principally upon the I 6th, who charge( anid captured a battery of heavy gulns in, position, losing one ollicer, Lieutenant llarrison, killed, ald sevoral woumnled, It was by a round shot from one of the batteries posted at thi* point that Colonel Chester was killed. The second position Was in rear of the first, and was constituted by a line of heights between the cantonmejits and the city. U'poII this ridge, when captured, the British line was establiAhed, with its left resting upon a tower used as a signal-post, its centre popn an old mosque, and its right upon a houle wvith enclosures strongly placed at the point where the hills begin to slopo down towards tluo plaini, suid known by the name of its fornier owvner, a Mlalbratta chief called llindoo Rao. Owiing to the obliluo position of the lille of hills in regard to the walls the riglht is in advaneo, tlte left tluown ba-:k, the mean di,tance from the city being, to judgo fronT the plan that lies before me, about a mile and a quarter. In this position the army was attacked by a sortie on tle very next evening, the tth, and lost in repelling it, as I mentioned in my last, B3ttye of the 't;;ides, a gallaiit and valuableoflicer. Onthe lOthemaieoanother tssault, r)etaftdrecpdised like thatof the day before,this time principally hy the :hoorkas, who defeatod witb great loss an attempt of the mnutincers to carry our battery at Iliidoo Rao's house. On the nee-11inl of the 12th a most determilled andl 'vell-plaLlnned asaullt was madet upon both extremities of our line at once. Ont thleright, at Hindoo Itao's house, the attack was promptly (lefeated, and the troops at that post (60th ('hoorkas and Guides) slew considerable numbers of the enemy, 50 of them in one garden, it is said. But on the left there seems to have been son ething of a surprise. T'Ihe battery at the signal tower was surrounded, and would probably, bitt for the signal gallantry of a picket of the 75th, have been captured. The flank of the position was in imminent danger of being turnedl. But the nine- pounder battery in the centre opened tire, su:pport3 were broulght up rapidly, and at length, though not till after a hard light of two hours, ths enemi gave w ay at all points. The loss on this day fell chiefly upon the 2d Europeans and the 75th. Captain Klnox of the latter regiment was shot throuurh the head while leading his men to the tower battery (hO the day following a large enclosure in advance of our left, known asMAletcalfe-house, vas occupied by our troops, and the erection of a battery of heavy guns and mortars commenced. Againstthis battery a sortie was directed on the lAth, butt was repulsed without dilliculty, as had beeni another earlier in the same day against our right. O{n the 17,th an allhir took place in which we were the assailants. That morning a shot from the city struick the cornier of Hindoo Rao's honse, and, glancing off' killed Lientenant WVheatley, of the late 54th, attached to the Ghoorkas, and (it is said) six meii. IH aving this advanced post of ours well under fire in -front, the enemy determined to attempt it also in flank, and for this purpose commenced on the 17th *to throw up a bAttery outside the western gtea of the town, at a large building known as the Eedghah. There they were attacked that same afternoon by 'Major Tombs' troop of Horse Artillery, orne cavalry, Rifles, and Ghoorkas,andbeaten out of the place withi the loss of the only gun they had had tine to bring out, all their ammunition, and, perhaps, 100 lives. For this achievement the Major received high commendation from General Barnard, who rode over to his position for the purpose. Two days later-on the 19th-appeared ! the mutineers from Nusseerabad, the late 15th and | 80th Regiments, with the battery of artillery that the Bombay Laanoers vainly attempted to rescue, e and m,e anl audacious irruption into the rear of | our lines. They tFreJ 4-2&munterx. at first by the troops of the Rajah of Jheend, who beha 9d extremely well, and afterwards by the 9th Lan66ra and Artillery. On the following morning they renewed the attack, and were finally repulsed with upwards of 200 killed. Ouir loss was, however, severe. Colonel Yule, of the9th Lancers, was killed, andLieutenant Humphrys, of the late 20th, and Alexander, of the late 3d. The wounded officers were Colonel Becher, Daly of the GCuides, and four of the Rifles, whose names are not given. The 21st and 22d were quiet so far as sorties are concerned, though the batteries on either side were busy as usual; but on the 23d "thie enemny attacked us," so runs the message sent to Lahore, " in great force from the Snbzee Mundee side (on our right flank and rear), and fought most desperately the whole day long. They had a strong position in a village and among the garden walls. Our loss has been great for us, but the loss of the mutineers has been very considerable." Later accounts say that the enemy's dead were counted at the close of the day by hundreds, the aggregate being estimated at not less than 1,000. This terrible defeat appeared to have cowed their spirit, for the three following days they never showed outside the wa]l3, and when, on the 27th, they did come out, they confined themselves to distant skirmishing, appearing entirely to have lost the vigour and resolution that had characterized their behaviour on previous occasions. "W While these scenes have been enacting at Delhi the disintegration of the Bengal army has progressed well nigh to completion. I count now only 10 or 1.7 line regiments out of 74 that are bearing arms for the Company. In the Punjab, which remains perfectly quiet, two more regiments intended for service either with the moveable column or against Delhi, the 33d and 35th, have been disarmed at Philour. The 29th, at Moradabad, have followed the example of the other three regiments in Rohilcund which had mutinied earlier. Fortinately, by the way, the men of these corps have not got to Delhi; at least, when last heard of they were detained on the further side of the Ganges, prevented from crossing by the rise of tho river). All the officers of the 29th escaped. Lower down tho Ganges, at Futtyghur, the 10th Native Infantry had long maintained its loyalty, though surrounded by mutiny on every side. At last the; broke, blut without doing violence to their officers or the general body of residents. A ghastly story, however, is current that the fugitives on their passage down the river in boats were interrupted near Cawnpore, draggedonshore, and massacred. AtCawnporo itself, which when I last wrote I hoped was safe, the three native infantry regiments and the one of cavalry had already mutinied. Sir Henry WVheeler has, however, maintained his position there, and has been strengthened by detachments of Madras Fusileers and other regiments. Colonel Neill, commanding the FPusileers, is the officer of whom I told you the story of the arrest of the railway officials at Calcutta. Ho has since done good service in the Valley of the Ganges, as at Benares and Allahabad. At the latter station, with a small body of his men and the loyal Sikh Regiment of Ferozepore, he inflicted upon the mutineers a loss so severe as effectually to quiet their spirit and to introduce a tranquillity that has not since been disturbed. Indeed, from AUahabad downwards to Calcutta all may be considered safe. Brigadier Havelock, who went round to Calcutta oil his return here from Persia, is collecting an European force at AUahabad, wnich is the nucleus of that large army that we hope in a few weeks to see concentrated at that point. He has the whole or the greater part of the 78th, 64th, 84th, the MIadras Fsileers, and a wing of the 37th. The 10th, I fancy, remains at Dinapore, where its presence has no doubt greatly contributed to keep the native portion of the brigade quiet. " As for Oude, I fear it may be said that the whole of the Contingent is gone-nor the Contingent only, but also the 22d Native Infantry at Fyzabad, with a company of native artillery. These latter troops treated their officers with respectful deference, and supplied them with boats to escape down the river Gogra, which joins the Ganges at Diuapore. On the passage down the fugitives were attacked, and several, it is feared, killed. Sir Henry Lawvrence, with the 32d and artillery, and such of the native portion of the Lucknow force as has remained stanch, still holds the capital. Front the large civil station of Futtehpore, betweeni Allahabad and Cawnpore, the residents fled across the Ganges to Banda, where the Nawab received and entertained them kindly. But they had not been there many days when, on the 14th of June, the detachment of Native Infantry and the Nawab's troops rose together, and1 they fled to Nagode, which all of them reached in safety. Thore the 50th Native Inflintry is stationed, and has not yet, to our knowledge, exhibited any unpleasant symptoms. But one cannot but feel very doubtful of its fidelity, so rapidly has the contagion spread. The important station of Saugor, with its 3Ist and 42d Native Infantry and 3d Irregular Cavalry, is gone, though the English company of Artillery, with its guns, and we hope the unarmed residents also, is safe in the fort. Jubbulpore, where the 52d Native Infantry is stationed, is certain to go too. We are come to Central India. Here the whole of the Gwalior Contingent-artillery, cavalry, and infantry-is up, as I told you in my last it was anticipated. The majority of the officers, with their wives and children, reached Agra in safety, but several are reported to have faller, though we may hope that in this case, as in others, the list first published will be subsequently reduced. Whe. thor or no Scindia has idlentified himself with the cause of his mutinous soldiery is not yet known. He may be stanch, perhaps, or even probably is; but the old woman, his adoptive grandmother (I believe that is the relation between them), who goes by the name of the Bye-za-bye, is undoubtedly busy bringing to bear against us her implacable zeal and her well-filled treasury. I know that she hag sent emissaries under the guise of complimentary visits to the kindred chieftains of Baroda and liolapore, causing to the British resident at the farmer station an unnecessary amount of disquiet, of which more presently. At Kolapore the resident failed to observe the ulterior object of the mission, but on reporting the circumstance was instantly directed to desire the arrest of the emissary. " But if the proceedings and designs of Scindia are as yet hidden from us, those of the other great Mahratta chief of Central India are fully known. The capital of Holkar, no less than the capital of his rival, has been the scene of revolt. Two of his personal regiments (he has no contingent) mutinied at Indore on the Ist of this month. On the morning of that day Colonel Durand, the acting resident, observing suspicious symptoms, despatched aa expriess to Mhow for- the European ba'ttry at that station, commanded by Oapti'b Hunget;vrd. That officer set out at once, but was met on tho road by a counter-order, informing him that the anticipated mutiny had broken out, and that Colonel Durand Xid fled. Captaln Hungerford retraced his steps to Mhlow, but the news from Indore arrived there with or before him, and that same evening the 231 Native Infantry rose, with the right 'wing of the 1st Cavalry, of which tho left had already mutinied at Neemuch, Colonel Platt, of the 23d fell, with his adjutant, Fagan, and Major Harris commanding the cavalry. The rest of the ofiec6r, with the women and children, arnd Captain Hlungerford With his gunq, got safely inco the fort, and the mutineers after firing the cantonments decamped. Without a day's delay Holkar sent down a Bpecial messenger to the Bonmbay Govelnment, informing them of his regret at what had taken place, assuring them that he should always be what he had hitherto been, the faithful friend of the English, and promising to raise fresh and trustworthy levies for the punishment of the mutineers and the preservation of order. Nor has he confined himself to mere protestations of loyalty. He has proved his sincerity by sending his treasure, to the amount of 24 lacs of rupees, into the fort of Mhow, where Captain Hungerford is opposing a gallant front to the danger, and declares that he can readily hold out tiU relieved. Telegraphic communication with Mhow, interrupted for a few days, was restored yesterday. The country round was reported tranquil. Colonel Durand was safe at Sehore, in the Bhopal country, and on hearing of Holkar's fidelity, and of the departu-re of the mutinous regiments for Delhi, would doubtless return to Indore. " The loyalty of Holkar has been of the last importance to our cause in Central India. We are not without the means of judging of the effect that would have been produced by his defection. The very rumour that the mutiny at Indore was his doing was at once sufficient to rouse more than one of the petty chiefs of Malwa. The rajalh of Dhar-you will see the place on the map just to the westward of M'lhow-whom I remember seeing down here three years ago, has been bestirring his scrubby little self. Iis neighbour of Amjhera has actually had the audacity to pounce upon the town of Bhopawar, where is located the British Residency for these little States, and to imprison the officials. IHis course, however, will soon be run. Not only is a force moving from Baroda, of Bombay infantry and Guicowar's guns, but Holkar, among his other good deeds, is sending a body of well-affected troops from his side, so that the little Rajah is likely to be shortly dispossessed of his raj. But could the revolts at Mhow and Indore have been prevented ? Probably so if General NVoodw burn's column from Poonah could have advanced at once instead of being detained bythe unlucky mutiny of the Hydrabad Cavalry at Aurungabad, of which and its punishment I vwrote in my last, and shaU write more presently. The very report that a Bombay column was advancing produced a strong effect, and in all probability postponed the breaking out of the mntinies. The Bombay troops have yet much to do, and so have those of Madras, who will operate upon Saugor from Hoshumgabad and Nagpore, and upon Aurungabad from Hydrabad. As the fire of disaffection approaches more and more closely the borders of the smaller Presidencies, and as I observe the calls made upon their native troops to quench it, and the mode in which those calls are received, it becomes more and more clear to me how great a thing it has been for India that its armies have been three, and not one. I mentioned in my last that Sir Thomas Munro was a great advocate of the distinct system. A yet greater man was equally strong in its favour. I have seen within the last day or two a copy of a letter from the Duke of Wellington to a friend in 1826, commenting upon and disapproving Sir C. ialcolm's wish for the amalgamation of ,the three armies. The Duke speaks most strongly of the dangers to be apprehended, in his opinion, from the establishment of a unity of feeling through our native soldiery. The native of Southern India, he remarks, differs from the native of Hindostan as much as a Spaniard from a Swede, and it is well for our power that the difference should be preserved. He refers, in support of his opinion, to the various mutinies that had up to that date taken place in India, to his knowledge of armies generally, and, among other things, to the then recent conspiracies of the Russian army. Well, then, the known spirit of the Bombay army, its wanit of sympathy, that is to say, with that of Bengal, operated at Mhow to check disaffection, and would probably have continiued to do so had the colimn not been directed to Aurungabad. It was necessary, hosvever, to coerce the mutinous regiment, of which several men were brought in prisoners from a place to wvhich they had fled, called Booldana, by a party of dragoons, and blown from guns or otherwise executed. This welltimed severity has awed that part of the country, and this column now advances on MIhow, commandod by Colonel Stuart, the General having fallen sick. Two guns, however, ar3 left at Aurungabad, and another squadron of Dragoons are gone there from Poonah with two Horse Artillery guns. Moreover, a force will move there from Secunderabad. So I hope our Nizam's frontier is safe. On the direct road to Mhow have moved 250 of the 86th, brought down here from Aden, a wing of the 1.9th Native Infantry, aid the 3d Cavalry of the Hydrabad Contingent. The latter, hitherto evincing a capital spirit, have reached the oNrbtAdda, but will not cross it. They will move along the luft bank till they fall in with the column advancing frorn Aurungabad. The important fortress of Asseerghur, on that line of march, is safe, the companies of the Gwalior Contingent that occipied it having been cleverly got rid of by the commandant, and afterwards partly disarmed by a party of the Bheel Corps. " Guzerat is quite safe, and the disquiet es; cited at Baroda by the news from Indore will dig otut when it is known that Holkar is stanch. Sattara is quiet. Search is being made for an enVakeel of the late Rajah, who excited the man to attempt the fidelity of the 22d (of whom I reported in my la; t the execution), and who appears to have been hatchinig a very complete and deliberate plot against us. The native officer of the 22d who gave up tho spy has been rewarded with the order of British India, and the behaviour of the Sepoy has also been suitably aclnowledged. Among other measures taken by the present Govern-ment in this qluestion on it3 own resnonsibility is the addition of two companies to each of the 29 regiments of this army. They will be raised entirely from the low caste people of the Deccan and the coast, and thus will completely turn the scale of numbers, which is now pretty evenly balance I between the menof that class and the natives of Hindostan. The native officers will be appointed from their own regiments, and thus the new companies will at once be firmly bound to the old. Again, the sending of two steamers to the Cape was a proceeding adopted by this Govern. ment on its owli responsibility, and will be a successful one. By the way, I should mention that the Nubia, on her passage down the Hoogly the other dayviththe English mail, met the Simoom going up, with the 5th Fusileers on board, who had been |shipped at the Mauritiius for Hougkong, and been intercepted at the Straits of Sunda. This we hear by telegraph from Madras. 1 " When I next write I hope to tell you of the fall of Delhi. I spoke just now of the resources of the mutineers. I now:lnd, from excellent authoIrity, that they haveliaem firing two 24-peuzders for every18-pounderofours. Theyhave thelargeeD n,senat in India, 200,QQQlb. of powdor, many miilionx of pe>>ugsl¢ caps, and hundreds of thousands of rounds o amnuiiition. Their practice has been a good as purs-if notbetter.

SIl? C. I,rAPTER upOnI t,e IrATDIfA1N AR1Alt- TO THE EDITOI OF TEE T1I3ES. Sir,-The following letter will throw light on the present ladian trouble3. Sir a. Napicr wrote it privately to a friend, and, as will be seen, con6dentially; but that which was especially so no longer requires that precaution, and I have laid it aside. Some private matters I have sunDresaed. W. NAPIEP., L1eutensnt.Geneva. " May 31, 1850. "I entirely agree in all you say in your letter to the court except your praise of the Government here. I even go further than you. I am not yet decided in my opinion, but I am disposed to believe that we might wit.h advantage appoint natives to cadetships, discharge all our native officers on the penmons of their present rank, and so give the natives common chance of command with ourselves -befure theJ tdke it ! " Every European boy, aye, even sergeants, now command aU native officers ! When the native sawv the English ensign live with him and cherish him, and by daily communication was made aware of his superior energy, strength, daring, and mental acquirements, all went smooth. Now things have changed. The young cadet learns nothing, he drinks, he lives exclusively with his own countrymen; the older officers are on the staff, or on civil employ, which the1y ought not to be ; and high-caste, -that is to say, mutiny-is encouraged. [ have just gotten this army through a very dangerous one, and the Company had better take care what they are at or some great mischief will yet happen ! " I think that native ensigns, lieutenants, and captains, aye, and commanders of corps too, wiiU assimilate with our officers, and in coiu-se of time gradually throw caste to the dogs, and be like ourselves in all but colour. I have no belief in the power of caste resisting the Christian faith for any great length of time, because reason is too strong for nonsense in the long run; and I believe if the Indians were made officers, on the same footing as ourselves, they would be perfectly faithful, and in time becomae Christians; not that I want to convert them, but so it v-ill be. " The high compliment you pay the Indian Government makes me laugh, because I know that wi.le you believe it it is not correct. No! no ! I will neither concede to you that we are ' strong, just, or regular ;' or that we take nwo more from the people than the latv) dedlares ' or that 'I ie pay ctery month.' Ourselves, yes. but not others. Now for a fact. The coolies who are summoned to carry the Governor-General's baggage when he moves are assembled at, or rather driven by force to, Simla from immense distances, and are paid about twopence a-day, under circumstances of great cruelty. Now, I happen to know that from the delays of offices, and~ without, perhaps, any tangible act of knavery in any especial officer or individual, some 8,000 or 10,00() coolies employed to take Lord down into the plains when he left India were not paid this miserable pittance for three years I My dear Sir, you lived in an enchanted circle at Calcutta; you know nothing of Indian Government beyond its theories,-no more than if you were Governor-General. The atrocities which go on are beyond description. You, in your library at Calcutta, could not know anything of them, but I, on my horse, passing through aU countries, saw and learned them on the spots; and very indignant I am at them and have been for many years. I put Scinde on a right footing; but when I left it the Bombay Govermment introduced all iniquity, in despite of the civil commissioner, the excellent Mr. Pringle, who succeeded me; and vwhere I left conte1t all is now discontent, only suppressed by the military force. I therefore cannot at all concur in your praise of our Indian Government, but the reverse. " There is not a regiment hers that moves whose march is not one of horrible oppression, not from indiscipline or military outrage, but from the systein of Government. I could, if I had time, give you the facts. But you ought to be well acquainted with this horrid system as you praise it, and if you are nrot acquainted with what takes place, on what grounds is your praise founded ? I shal soon be going back to England, and hope we shal meet, and X will then give you the real history of your strong, just, and regular Government as it works in the provinces, and of the atrocities of the natives we employ as uncovenanted servants. The English coinmit sins of omission, the natives Bins of commission, and they will do so until their accursed castc is ro]]ed over. " I have given their - Brahmins a floorer, as far as the troops are concerned, by introducing Goorka troops into the line, and showing the Brahmins that we cap enlist better soldiers without their leave. I am against any interference with the religion of the people. I would no more offend a Hindoo than I would a Christian; but I would not let a Hindoo offend me. " We all pay respect to a cow in presence of a IIindoo-a respect he laughs at, for he knows we do not feel it. But at the same moment we take his oxen and himself from the plough by force; we send him a thousand miles march with a regiment; he loses his harvest, his ground remains untiled, his family perish, his oxen, overloaded and overdriven by the soldiers, drop on the road, and he is not paid a farthing for them; his cart, broken, is left .on the road, he is made to drive another, whose owner has fled in desperation, and after six or eight months-I knew one case of years even-he returns a ruined man to his once happy home. He may find his wife and children alive; he may find, if she is not pretty, that she has remained faithful among his friends of the village; but it is as com mon to find that one of the European magistrate's uncovenanted native people has taken her. And as regards females the Europeans are, though magistrates, pretty loose, I have heard, in these matters; but this I only know by hearsay, and cannot answer for, though I perfectly believe it. However, as this is a matter of private bargain, there is no great cause for complaint. We know that the English dare not act with open violence against womenthe natives do; and I believe very few magistrates have the energy and ability to control those natives who are ernpKTyed. " But there are some glorious magistrates who really do exalt the honour and power of England in the East. I came through a district governed by a Mr. Banks. I do not know him ; I nevor saw him, but I really felt proud of my countryman. Yet even there I found tyranny by the " board" which rules the Ptmjab ; he cannot help that; all he does himself is superb. WVell, I must finiish. All I say to you is at present between you and I in confidence."
THE CUSTOM-HOUSE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Will you allow me a smal space in your valuable journal for the purpose of calling the attention of the authorities of this institution to the disgraceful state in which it is kept? ft is Impossible to conceive the filthiness of the entrance, the staircase, thelobby, and the long-room. Any one would imagine that the manufacture of soap had ceased, that water was solely intended for drinking, and that labour could mean nothing beyond quill-driving and collecting the publ-c money. If the Turkey oarpet gentlemen with their snug rooms and private entrance had to wend their way to their offices up the public stairs, I sup. pose this abomination of dirtiness would not be permitted. It now being pointed out to them in your columns, I trust they will see the necessity of immediately rendering the Custom-hbose less like a large pigsty that its present internal appearance would suggest.

The preparations for celebrating the birthdav of the First Napoleon ar>, with one or two exceptions, pretty much thes,Zsne as in previous years. The most gorgeous display wa. inmnediately followirg the re-establishment of the Empire. The chcolera, the Russian war, and the :undations vere circumstances sufficient to arrest the jAsh Expenditure on these occasions, and indeed the Most appropriate ceremony in the present in. stance was the inauguration of the Louvre, of vhic I gave you some account yesterday. The Jay, however, will be marked by certain displayo iutdicient to remind the peoplo that itis the fete of the Emperor. The day is kept as a strict holyday. The Bourse is closed; the Post-office is kept open o.nly till 1 o'clock ; the theatres are accessible to the pui>lic gratuitously; maypoles are erected in the CharniD de. Mars and at the Barrier du Trone; a grand& militarv representation, the subject of which iS taken xhom the last campaign in Kabylia, wiU be performed; displays of horsemanship and other representations in a theatre erected in the Champ de Mars, wbere orchestras will execute military symphonies; balloonl.s will be let off on the same spot; regattas will take place on the Seine, between the Pout d'Anlma and the Pont de Jena; a grand concert by 250 instrumentalists and 300 singers in the Avenue du Meleagre in the Tuileries; and at night all the public buildings, and, no doubt, many private ones, will be finely illuminated. The Hotel de ViUe is even now decorated with flags, and many houses along the Boulevards and other large streets are similarly ornamented. At 9 o'clock there will be two displays of fireworks, one on the heights of the Trocadero, and the otler at the Barricre du Trone. At 6 o'clock this morning the cannon of the Invalides fired a salute, which wiU be repeated this evening at sunset. Distributions of provisions were made to the indigent portion of the population at the AMairies of the 12 arrondissements. As I write a mass is celebrating at Notre Dame, to be concluded with a Te Deum, and at which the principal functionaries, civil and miltary, and deputations from the great bodies of the State, attend. A similar service is performing in the other Churches of Paris. The crowd of persons to whom gratuitous admission is given to the Grand Opera began to assemble at 5 o'clock this morning; it is every moment becoming greater, and all there, men and women, will wait patiently until 2 o'clock, the hour at which the doors are thrown open. The receptions of the Emperor and Empress at {he Tuileries are conducted nearly in the same manner as on former occasions. At 11 o'clock the households of their Majesties and of the Princes of the Imperial family were received; at balf-past 11 the Ministers were admitted to pay their respects. At 1 the Grand Chancellor of the Legion and the Go- ernor of the Invalides will attend; at halfpast 1, in the Salle du Trone, the diplomatic body; at 2 the Presidents and the members of the standina committees of the Senate and Legislative Body, the Presidents of the Law Courts, and the heads of the different constituted bodies, the staff of the army of Paris and the National Guard, the magistracy in fulU costume, and the civil and military functionaries in uniform, will be received. At 10 o'clock this morning about a hundred of the old soldiers of the Empire of various arms, and in the military costume of the period, passed along the Boulevards to the Place de Vend.lme in order deposit their usual offerings, crowns of irnrortGUc3, at the base of the columin. The Emperor, on the occasion of his f6te, has granted pardons, commutations, or reduction of punishment to 1,142 persons con&ined at the bagnes and other penitentiary establishments. By an Imperial decree issued on the occasion of the Emperor's fete Vice-Admiral du Petit-Thouars has been promoted, to the rank of Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. Msi. Beranger, President of the Court of Cassation, Vice-Admiral Charner, and Count de Salignao-F6n6lon, French Minister in Switzerland, to that of Grand Officer; and Baron de Talleyrand- Perigord, Minister-Plenipotentiary on a special mission in the Danubian Principalities, M.

The list alsocontains 32 promotions to the rank of Officer, and 156 nominations to that of Enight of the same Order. M. Laity, ex-Prefect of the Basses-Pyr6n6es, and General Dumas, Councillor of State and Director of the Affairs of Algeria, have been raised to the dignity of Senator. Cardinal Morlot, Archbishop of Paris, has been named Grand Almoner to the Emperor. Monseigneur Menjaud, Bishop of Nancy and first Chaplain to the Emperor, has been promoted to the rank of Commander in the Legion of Honour. About 6 o'clock a thunderstorm burst over Paris, and the rain fell for some time in torrents. It lasted abont half an houir, and cooled the atmosphere, which was rapidly approaching the great heat of last week. The colonels of regiments in Paris have been authorized by the Minister of War to place detahments of troops at the disposal of each parish priest in Paris, to assist at the Te Deuzn which is to be chanted tc day on the occasion of tlhe Emperor's fete. A double ration of wine is to be distributed to the troops, who are, moreover, to receive an addition of half a day's pay. The Mon,iteur publishes a list of promotions,and nominations in the order of the Legion of Honour, as also in the army. The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 5th August anmount to 1,024,071f. 47c., being a decrease of 142,642f. 21c. as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The receipts from the 1st January to the 5th August amount to 34,022,428f. 62c., being an increase of 5, S42,774f.6c. as compared with the corresponding period of the year 1856.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Are.. 6G In my last letter I announced to you the imminence of a diplomatic rupture between the French Ambacsador and the Porte. Before this reachesyou I the telegraph will have already announced that the I rupture has taken place, and that the representatives of Rusia, Prussia, and Sardinia, following the policy of the French Ambassador, have also followed his example, and suspended relations with the Porte.! As I informed you in my last, it was decided last Thursday morning, after a Council which occupied the whole night, that the elections in Aloldavia could not be annulled. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in communicating this decision to the French Ambassador, added that the Ambassadors of Englard and Austria concurred in the opinion of the Porte. MI. de Thouvenel protested against this answer, and, addressing a direct conmnvication. to the Sultan, informed him that he cculd no. ronger hold diplomatie relations with Mip tawhn were under foreigu influence. Such an accupation could 'not puasa unnoticed. The Sultan rem -ved on ohannag hisgtbtl - question might be exan±UjX t M'u:1y time by a he* Cabkixet, which could not be resonably su3pefld df being urnrier tnto foreig inuence. Although it w^as the middle oi tb9 f@a.t of B3airam, the Sultau en Friday evening sent for Rodscbid P-- nr-l 4-1 irom tmn the seals of State. He then summoned [a the Palace the venerable XusL.kpha Pasha of Crate, a man justly respectel by every cTne for the inde. pendence of his character and the so80ndness of hij judgment, and appointed him Grand Vizib A- t the same time were appointed-Aali Pasha, repre,.`Ut tire of Turkey at the Congress of Paris, Ministee foil Foreign kffiair,, in the room of Ali Ghalib Pasha, who pa.maed to the direction of pious founda: tions; Redsebid Pasha, President of the Tanzimat, in the room of Mohemet Kibrisli Pashar who remains in the Cabinet without a , rtfolio; Hassib Pasha, Minister of Financee in the room of Moussa Safetti Pasha ; Kianil Pasha, of Jeddah, Minister of War, in the room of Riza Pasha. Mehemet Ali Pasha and the smaller fiinctionaries were not changed. The new Ministry having been duly instaUed AL de Thouvenel consented to recognize it, and to transacb business with it, but changed nothing in his demands. He allowed thehn three days, ending Tuesday morning, at 10 o'clock, to aDswer the ulti.rntunm he had sent to the last Cabinet, stating that if the reply were unfavourable he should leave at once, -such being his instruietions from the Emperor himself. On the other hand, tbe Anstrians protesteI energetically against annuUing the elections, threatening, if stuch a thing took place, at once to eccupy the Principalities with 150,000 men. The ErDglish Ambassador, without backing the threat ot the Austrianis, seemed of their opinion. MIustapha Pasha, with all his anxiety to arrive at; a satisfactory conchlusion to this di,-agreeable conflict, which every moment was becoming more senous, could not do much. The demands of the French Ambassador were peremptory, but on the other hand the Sultan was determined not to cede a point in which he considers his prerogative involved. To annul the elections in Moldavia is to him the first step towards sanctioning the union oi Moldavia. and Wallachia, and this union he is determined. never to allow. After numerous Councils a transaction was proposed on Monday evening, which it was hoped would tatisfy the French, while it guarded the Sultan's dignity and interests. It was proposed to sunmmon to Constantinople the Kaimnakans of Moldavia and Wallachia, and to try thera here, and if it was proved that they had tampered with the freedom of the elections, as asserted by the French, then to annul them. This proposal was made to the French Ambassador on Tuesday morning, and, although it seemed to satisfy every reasonable requirement, it was rejected at once.- The French Ambassador insisted on the immediate annul2ing, intimating his intention to leave the following day unless he received a favourable answer by 8 a.m. The representatives of Russia, Prussia, and Sal dinia also intimated to the Porte that they had received orders to do exactly what the French Ambassador should do. The Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs seeing a rupture imminent tendered their resignations to the Sultan on Tuesday evening, but they were not accepted. Another Council was held on Tuesday evening, under tbe presidency of the Grand Vizier, and the decision was again that the elections canuot be annulled; and after having received the Sultan's approbation this final decision was communicated to the French Ambassador yesterday morning (Wednesday). The time was now come to act. The French steam tender Ajaccio got up steam, and came o&1 the French Ambassador's palace in Therapia. HIis ExceUency went on board at 12 o'clock; the FrencbL flag was hoisted at the main and the yards were manned. A Royal salute of 21 guns was fired fronm the two carronades of the Ajaccio, sounding like so many minute guns; the sailors gave nine cheers and the flag was hauled down. MI. de Thouvenel then. went in the Ajaccio to DolmabaktchU, and had a, private auidience with the Sultan, in which he took leave of His Majesty, expressilng his regret at having been compelled to the step he had just taken. The Ajaccio then went up the Bosphorus to Bujukdec", the residence of the Russian Minister, and as she passed by a Russian brig-of-war there stationed the Russians saluted the French flag with. 21 gunq, and, manning yards, cheered the Freneh and were cheered in return. The French Amibassador then went back to his palace at Therapia, where he is still, and where he will remain a fewdays, settling various private affairs; it is said he will leave on londay or Tuesday next. French subjects have in the meantime been placed under the protection of the Spanish Legation. In the afternoon of yester. day the Russian Minister notified to the Porte that as the elections in Moldavia had not been annulled he had orders to suspend relations with the Porte; so the ceremony of striking the Russian flag was gone through this morning at Bujukdere, and the Russian anrs over the gate of the palace in Pera have been covered over with canvass. T-he Prussians and the Sardinians have also gone tbrough prettv nearly the same ceremonies.
CRYSTAL PALACE. On Saturday tho first annual fitC of the Early Closirg Association took place at the Crystal Palace. Since the gathering of last year this society has made con. siderable progress, both with regard to the numbers con. nected with the association itself and the gradaal but steadily extending support which it has received frona nearly all the employers of labour. In fact, the early Closing and Saturday half-holiday movement is fast becoming a recognized principle In large establishments, and one which we are glad to see has been well advocated and libe. raUy responded to. The interest felt in the objeots of the association was evinced by the attendance at the Crystal Palace, though the ft'!e on tha: oxcasien was but a proli. minary to the great display of Saturday next, when a large concourse of visitors Is anticipated. The weather, too, wAs by no means as propitious a3 the lovers of out-door amusements could desire. Taroughout the morning it was gloomy and threatening, and during the afternoon it rained with that steadiness of purpose which is peculiar to our climate on festive occa. sions. One of the specialities of the day was a great cricket match between 11 of the clerks and 11 of the warenousemcn of the metropolis, which was sharply contested and in the end (thanks to the rain) left undecidod. We need not enter into the minutias of this sport, for cricket is but ^ dull game to the lookers on, and its interest is by no means heightened in the narration. Them niaical arrangements, which. proved a great solace when aU were confined by the weather to the interior of the buildinig, were on the most libe-al scale. The bands of the Scots Fnsileer Guards and the Crystal Palace Company played alternately throughout the day, and in addition there was a concert by the Vocal Association, conducted by Mr. Btnediot, with some most admirable performances on the great llandel organ bv M.i8s Stirling. Over and above all these, and the permanent attractions of the interior, the series of upper fointains were set in action twice during the day, so that the visitors were not suffered to pass an hour without some fresh object to elicit their admiration. The performances of the Vocal Association, inmtitut6d in iulitation of the Cologne Uuion, and which, though formed as lately as January last, already d s- plays considerable proficiency, were met with the most hearty applause, and the effect of the concluding national anthem, in which all the m&ass of visitors joined and swelled the chorus by 12.000 voices, was grand and Impressive in the extreme, All the various fine arts courts were throngcd during the latter part of the afternoon, and the Ceramic Court, which has been entirely rearranged in the .ost taEteful and effective manner, was always crowded. Nexti Saturday the great f,tc of the as9ociation takes placo, crc which occasion there are to be Sco-tish games and old English pastimes, after the style of those gyminastic reunain. which took plaue a few years since in IIolland-psrk.

CHINA. (FROM OuPn SPECIAL COx RSPOvrmN % HONGRONG, Jutr. 12 To 23. The intelligence frona India has been the single topic of interest here since the arrival of the last mal. WVe are not speculating, as you probably are, how this spirit of disaffection, which seems to run along the ground and spring up like fires from naphtha wells, was first lit up. Nobody here asks whethor we are to pay in blood and treasure for the freaks of a fanatic colonel, or whether the horror of the outbreak is due to the curious felicity which managed to outrage all Mahommedan and Hindoo prejudices by a single act, and unite the two races upon their only point of sympathy-a horror of pIg. We selfish fiongkongians think only what effect the outbreak wvill have upon the Chinese war. The 5th and tho 1 Oth Regiments are to ba stopped at Singapore and to be diverted to Calcutta. If Lord Canning's distresses should be great, instructions have been left at Singapore to honour hi, draughts for troops to any extent. Meanwhile, our available land force for carrying on war with the Chinese empire consists of two Generals, a very large body of officers, and about 1,000 men. For a da.h ve might undoubtedly take 500 Marines from the ships and from Macao fort, and borrow a coup!e of thousand bluejackets from the ships. These, with the aid of the vessels that can float within range of the city, and perhaps of the 400 Sepoys in this town, wvould be quito enough to blow their way through Canton. But to seize the city and to hold It, and to be able to march forth and give battle to the army which would certainly be brought together on the heights, are very different matters. Even with the brigade of Marines that may now be soon expected from England we shaU not be strong enough for these purposes, according to all scientific military calculations. So rife Is the conviction here that nothing can be attempted for three months that I had almaost determined to go hence to Delhi, and iavestigate the state of things there on the spot. But 16 days each way by sea and 1,000 miles each way by dak render the stop too hazardous. I should possably spend 5001. and three months' time only to find that the mutiny was quelled before I reached DehiJ1 and that Canton had fallen and the expedition had gone northwards before I returned to flongk ong. Delay, however unavoi lable, is most unfortunate for our interests. We want a peaceful country to trade with and a strong (loverument to treat with. Yet every success short of actual occupation of the ciht only weakens the authority without breaking the obstinacy of the rulers. The rumours that reach us from the interior all say that the rebels are making head again, and that some common course of action h3s been established between bodies which had before acted independen.lv of each other. I place no absolute faith in any statement of fact madle by a Chinese about his own c2untrv. The merchants here have the most imp)rtant pecuniary interests in obtaining information as to the movements of the rebels. Whether certain roads are open, and whether the produce of certain provinces can come down, are questions of money import. To them knowledge is dollars. But I have been told by the heads of the most ent.erprising houses that this information cannot be bo uht. They send oult their spies, and the spies having passed their time at the nearest spot out of sight in drinking samshou, and sleeping in the shade, come back with most precise informatlonperhaps, for this has happened, with a document purportinig to be a copy of the last memorial addressed by Yeh to the Emperor. Tiue, however, shows that all this is falsehood and forgery. It is falsehood and it is forgery, not because the spy could not get real information for money, but because he can invent it for nothing. I put no faith, therefore, In specific news from the Interior. When I am told that enavoys from the rebels have held interviews with the elders of all the viUages and towns on their western line of march, and that a compact has been entered into that their advance shall be unresisted, that private property shaU be spared, and that none but mandarins shall be massacred, I do not receive it, although coming from the best availablo authority, as reliable intelligence. But thessi rumnouirs are so consistent with the natural sequence of effect from cause that I belleve they have some foundation in fact. The rebellion was quenched for a time in the blood of the 100,000 humani creatures who in the years I855 and 1856I wero put to death in the execution ground of Canton. Subsequently more favoured criminals were turnel into hovels built expressly for the purpo3e, and found there a knife, a fatal dose of opium, and a rope, and were told to spare their families the ignominy of a public execution by a v oluntary death. But the West has again risen to protect the fugitives who come among them with dollars in their pockets, and the East Las found new proselytes to legitimacy and plunder. 'Meanwhile scarcity presses more or less heavily upon the whole population. In Canton the rids are flying,and the poor are starving. Even in 1'ekin (I speak on the authority of a memorial which the authorities allow to appear in the G oo tI , a man's labour will hardly suffice to proci;re rice for his own belly, whereas formerly it would feed him and hlis family. While physical distress thlus swells the ranks of the insurgents Yeh remains impassible as ever. During the bombardmient of Canton he was accustomed to retire within a grotto niado of English cotton bales and smoke his pipe calmly while the shells were falling. -le preserves his usual habits. Howqua goes to him and states the necessity for yielding; Yeh stares at h:m and says nothing; Howqua retires; and some days after comes back with other Chine'se merchants to bcg that the trade may at least be opened with Macao, so that tea may go down and be exchanged for rice. Yell still ansvwers onlyby a silent stare. The Chinese now remember or invent a romantic histo.-y for their proconsul. They say that Yeh's first wife and all her kin were murdered by the Cantonese, and that in longi past days he vowed to be revenged by the destruction of their city,-a fiction by no means improbable so far as the murder is concerned, for the Cantonese wonld murder anyone, but somewhat incompatible with the notorious fact that by his viqorous measures he preserved the city from being sacked by the rebels. MIL- -: . This state of things cannot long continue. One man, with a few hundreds of pirates and robbers connected with s cldlers, cannot keep down Va flourishing population of a million of people, especially when every one of that million has seen the tires and heard the explosions that told the destruc tion of the Imperial fleet. If we delay to take CanCton it isto be fearedthat the rebels will anticipate us.uIf this should happon,w ha at ar e w e to do They are not munch better affected to the "4 outer barbarian"rthans the mandriare. We shallthenhave no one to fight with and no one to treat with. In driving out the rebels we shall only be doing the work of the Emperor, and our clai ms to compensation would be presented i to an exhaustte d Treasury. On the other hand, we ought to know more of Chinese politics than the best informed among us yet know, before we undertake to guaantee the Tartar dynasty in return f or corame erj advantage, Since I have been in the colony everyone has been not only willing, but even emulou s to enable me to inform the public at home. From the men who study the language with philological enthuslasmn, and who speak to the (hiumae In their own idiom, to the hea d s of those merc etile house -which, Janiu-like keep their European eyeo for European marketa, and look upon China only with the Chinese eyes of their brokers and compradors-all have given me every paper and every fact which they possess. I hope I have not been negligent in the use of opportunities; but tho result of all I hear and see is a settled conviction that at present we know nothing-absolutely nothing -of the nature of those elements which are at workE inside China. Crotchets and theories and confident statements are rife, both In conversation and in print; but they are all the offspring of vain imaginings, not sober deductions from facts. In this uncertainty we have only one obvious thing to do-to sei7e Canton and hold it against all comers. Masters of Canton, we can influence Fatshan and make our power felt among the piratical population of the 96 villages that lie among the creeks of the Canton river. But we must occupy Canton at once if possible-before the French and Americans come to further complicate tho situation,-ff not, then at the earllest moment that our chiefs think themselves equal to the task. 1 have no reason to say that timid councils wil prevail here when the time arrives for action, but if such should be the case it wil be a grave national misfortune. ICeppel ought to be reUelled or shut up or kept outof the way, or put uilder very stringent orders, if any council of war should be concocting some scientific scheme for taking Canton secundurm aricin. That impatient Commodore is capable of spoiling aU their plans by malking a dash at the place and carrying it In as many hours as they allow months for the task. But if it were a Sebastopol it must be taken if we are determined to keep up any trade with China. The north is quiot, beeause the north has felt our power and believes that Canton will be made to feel it, but for no other reason. The Edinburgh Reviewer, who discusses the China question in the number of that review just received, is wrong in many matters,-in all that he writes of Hongkong ludicrously wrong ;* but he is undoubtedly right when he affirms that " The people In and around Canton now confidently believe that although we beat the regular soldiers during the war, their own volunteer corps could expel us from the coultry." I have heard the Chinese merchants say that at Macao almost in the sane words:- I Inglishmen too much brave In devilship, but no too much large heart catchee that city." Some doubt was expressed as to whether we really had the great Wang hnmsf for an adversary at Fatshan. This is now abuLndantly cleared utp, for among the docutments brought to the Admiral some days after the battle was an ornamental paper carcfully eacased In a double pewter envelope. Upon being spread before the all-expounding Mr. Wade, he at once read it off as Wang's commission. It is a curious document, but too long for int to copy. Mioreover, they who are inquisitive In such matters will tind a translation in the Orvrl,t,d Cihiinia MIail. PEor Wang ! All our officers pity him as a footuan worthy of their steeL He ouce went into action against some pirates on the pa.idlebox of an English steamer, and then wrote a letter to say that he had received some aid from the barbarians. He is lurking somewhere in close concealment, for Yoh is said to have declared that he will decapitate him directly he can lay hands upon him. Our sailors are just like big schoolboys. Tae Chinese tie rlbands round their cannon, and Jack, when he boarded the junks, usuaUy untied this ornament and transferred It to his own gun in the bows of his boom boat. As Lieutenant HalUowes was steering his boat back from Fatshan he had to pass between two junks already blazing, and with guans pointed across the boat's course. " Give way, mon," he said, expecting that the junks would go up or the guns go off before he could get clear; but his crew, although they had good store of flags, had forgotten the ribands. " Beg pardon, Sir," said the coxswain, speaking for the rest, " weve got no rlbands on the gun, mightn't we just go and take away them things " To their great chagrin the officer did not think it quite conistent with his duty to get his men blown up for such an object. Some men were left all night in charge of the fort, and as they had little to eat and nothing to drink, it was difficult to make a jolly night of it. They hit upon the expedient of collecting all the gingals and Chinese spear rockets together, lightk.v a fire under them, and sitting in a half-circle. As the gingals from time to time heated, and the flames reached the rockets, they exploded ; so the garrison of the fort had excitement and fireworks half the night through. The naval exploits have, of course, been upon a smaller scale since the 1st of June. The Sampson, however, managed to secure five pirate junks which bad sent detachments on shore to plunder a village. On the approach of the Sampson's boats the pirates, as usual, fired their guns and jumped overboard; but the villagers, meanwhile, had turned out to see the fight, and as the pirates landed they were all knocked on the head with bamboo poles. Captain Corbett, also, in the Inflexible, got hold of a pirate -a notorious scourge. Ton jtnks laden with rice were sailing gaily up the river to Canton, when It was intimated o the Commodore that they had very much the cut of mandarin junks. They were accordlngly detained. Great was the indignation of the Chinese of Hongkong. They were declaredto beHongkong property. Innocent traders wore being ruined ! There ought, at least, to have been some notice of a blockade. "IlWhy for you no send chit ?" Orders were sent to release them; but Keppol, who is tenacious in his opinions, was not quite satisfied. He ordered some of thecrie bags to be broughton deck, and when this was done the junks were found to have each a fair cargo of guns, soldiers' jackets, and other warlike stores-including, it iz said, several eases of revolvers. Such are the 'little incidents of the war which Queen Victoria is waglng against MIr. Commissionor Yeh. Meanwhile the screw steam corvette Esk has arrived from Panama, and the Pearl has also come in. The Pblegethon, French steamer of war, brings us news that the Shannon arrived at Singapore on the 11th, and was there when she left; but you wiU probably have later news from Singapore than I can send you. The Encounter and the Saracen are gone to Slam, the former to take the Siamese Embassy to Suez, and thence to proceed home. The wreck of the Raleigh is advertised to be sold by auction on the 29th ilnst. Apart from the Indian intelligence, the news from England brought by the mail on the 10th was that the instructions from England were to occupy Formosa ; that some comfortable twaddle had found out that Alum's bread was not poisoned; and that the Americans have resolved to let us fight while they manage all the trade during our operations and participate in all the results of our success. The statement as to Formosa I shaU not believe until I hear it upon very certain authority. As to the Alum bread there is some of it in England, and several loaves of it are here. If the iadividual who, at a safe distance, talks so scepticaUy upon this matter will eat half a pound of this bread it will terminate aUl discussion, and set tho question at rest in a most satisfactory manner. Mr. Tarrant, of this city, has revived the sub ece by bringing an action against Alum for selling unwholesome bread. On Monday the case came on for trial. The Attorney-General, abandoning all suggestion of guilty knowledge in the defendant, reated his case upon the common law obligation cast upon a baker to seU only bread fit for the food of man. The presence of arsenic was fuUy proved and the jury returned a verdict for $1,010. The point of law is of course reserved. Having no great quantity of news to communicate, I take the advantage of the leisure to gossip a little about this island of Hongkong and the city of Victoria. And first let rae ask, why is it that we are so far from home ; why is it that our rulers are yet in ignorance of the critical condition of our Indian empire ? Why have we 9,000 miles between England and her Eastern dominions untraversed by a telegraph ? I was much struck Last year in Algeria by the wonderful network of wires whereby the French have connected aU their military posts-in Africa, and by the care with which they improved and preserved, and the vast advantages thay derived from, their facilities of commUnication. If the telegraph across the Mediterranean is not completed, it has at least been comrmenced. Yet here we have a possession upon which the eyes of the mother country are fixed-for trifling with the safety of which a House of Commons was dissolved-which is one of the greatest tributaries to the river of our national wealth-which must always be the pivot of great operations in war or commerceo, and not an effort is made to bring is within hail of England. The French cannot colonize, but they can govern. Had they our Eastern empire Aden, Bengal, Calcutta, and even HIongkong would by this time have been brought within five minutes of the Louvre. Th:s is one of those few essentials wherein economyis fatuity and monev is uo measure of value. A great mind wo d not hesitate i bind together every one of those military posts which form the stepping-stones by which we Englishmen pass irom dominion to dominion round the world ; a mind of very moderate enterprise might contemplate the Immediate laying down of wires to connect England with Alexandria, and Alexandria with Aden. Yet our folks at home are hesitating and chattering-chattering about unimportant sums favouring impossible schemes for carrying wires across wild countries and through untamed tribes, w hen they ou]ght to be bending their energies to d v the work. You will be sending troops to India when th'e danger no longer exists, or when the aid given is no longer equal to the increased necessity. You will be sending fleets and armies from England to China after peace has been concluded. Iu matters of Government nothing is so expensive as ignorance. The money thus wasted would make yottr telegraph a dozen times over. Let me chronicle some of my first Impressions of British China before the surprise has worn away. The first great astonishment to a man who recollects Sir Francis Maitland's report, that there was anchorage for ships and room on the Island for one house, is to find many merchant princes living in many gorgeous palaces, a city two miles long, every article of home luxury except a bracing breeze, and fleets which could feed a principality and conquer an empire. When he has realized this fact, his next idea is what an utterly helpless creature he is in the midst of all this newly-created greatness. H3owever kind and self-denying the friend to whom you are committed may be, you soon find out that he knows no more the means of obtaining creature comforts than you do. Every resident, be he married or single, has his " major domo," his " compra. dor," a long-tailed sleek Chinamnan,who is his general agent, keeps his money, pays his bills, does aU his marketing, hires his servants and stands security for their honesty, and of course cheats him unmer cifully. The advantage"is that he does not allow any one else to cheat him. The comprador is the link between the barbarian Englishman and the civilized world of China. The Englishman knows very little of China beyond what the comprador chooses to tell him, and the comprador chooses to tell him nothing worth knowing. Of course your comprador is a rich man. He fs worth from $5,000 to $40,000. There are two he-e who are reputed to be worth $100,000. One of these was " squeezed " (this is the term used) to the extent of $10,000 by the Mandarins, in order to pay the expenses of the present war. Thus, as we found the cannon on board the junks primed with the best Dartford powder, so we see that Yeh pays his braves with English plunder quietly accumulated in Hongkong. The process is this :-The Mandarins seize the father, mother, sisters, and brothers of the juicy comprador, and submit them to a course of slow torture until the squeeze has had its due effect. By this hlghly effective mode the Mandarins keep all the Chinese in Hongkong under their control, and draw large sums from the colony. When we come to settle with them we ought to insist upon all this money being repaid; we ought to naturalize the Chinamen who live in our Chinese dominions ; and we ought to make extortion from them an offence to be provided for by treaty. UInless you protect these people you cannot expect them to look upon you as their masters. The elegant Greek slave imposed his language and his modes of thought upon his barbarous Roman master; our civilized Chinese attendants have communicated to us outer barbarians the syntax of the Cbinese tongue. They have made for us a new English language, wherein sounds once familiar to us as English words startle us by new significations. According tc the canons of criticism they have well done,- "Dixeris egregle, notum si callida verbum "Reddiderit junctura novum." Horace muBt have stolen his ars poetica from Con. fucius. My friend introduced me to his comprador thus:- " You see gentleman,-you tawkee one piecey coolie one piecey boy-larnt pigeon, yon savey, no number one foolo-you make see this gentlemanyou make him house pigeon." This was said with great rapidity, and in my Inno. cence I believed that my friend was speaking Chinese fluently. He was only talking " Canton English." Translated into the vernacular it would stand,- " You see this gentleman,-you must engage for him a coolle and a boy-people who understand their business, you know, not stupid fellows; you will bring them to him. and then manage to get him a lodgiur and furnish it." lorC whom the poite comprador, le-niter atterens caud am, replied,- "Hfab got. I catchee one piecey coolie, catchee one piecey boy. House pigeon number one dearo, no hab got. S,oger manl hab catohee house pigeon.' "Must got." "Heuigh." The basis of this ",'Canton English"-whieh is a tongue and a literature for there are dictionaries and grammars to ecucidate it, consists of turning the " r" into the "1," adding final vowels to every word, and a contant use of " eavey" for "know," " talkee" for "s peak," " piecy" for piece," "number one" for " firt elasM," but e,pecially and above all the continual employment of the word " plgeon." Pigeon means business in the most extended sens3 of the word. "Heaven pigeon hab got" means that church service has commenced; " Jos pigeon" means the Bhuddist ceremonial; " Any pigeon Canton ?" means " Have any operations taken place at Canton?" " That no boy pigeon, that Coolie pigeon," fs the form of your servant's remonstrance if you ask him to fill your bath or take a letter. It also means profit, advantage, or speculation. "Him WVang too much foolo, him no savey, vely good pigeon hab got," was the commentary of the Chinese pilot upon the Fatshan Creek business. Until you can not only speak this language fluently, but also, which is far more difficult, understand it when spoken rapidly in a low monotonous voice, aU communication with your servants is impossible. The second morning after I had been installed in my dwelling my new " boy" Ah Lin, who sleeps on a mat outside my door, and whom I suspect to live principally upon successful rat hunts, for he knocks down about three per diem with a bamboo pole as they run about the room-this Ah Lin, drawing up my musquito curtains, presenting me with the 6 o'clock cup of tea, and staring at me with his little round eyes, gravely remarked, "M Missa Smith one small piecey cow child hab got." It was a long time before I comprehended that, it being part of a "boy's" duty to inform his master of the social events of the colony, he wished to give me to understand that Mrs. Smith had presented her husband with a daughter. It makes a bachelor laugh and an exiled family man almost cry to hear this grotesque caricature of the language of the nursery. The climate of Hongkong has not presented itself to me with a pleasant aspect. The city of Victoria is on the wrong side of the sugar loaf. That Victoria Peak shuts out the south-west monsoon which blows in grateful breezes upon the southern coast ; the heat, therefore, is a stagnant, up and down, fierce, often reflected heat-a heat there is no escaping-which finds you out in your hiding place in a shady verandah, and shoots across from the white face of the opposite house, or up from the surface of the white road, or down at an obtuse angle from the dark cliff of decomposing granite. We new arrivals are told that It is nothing to what it will be in August; but as every European body is already covered with a red rash descriptively caUed the " prickly heat," reputed to be wholesome and felt to be intolerable, we agree that it is impossible that a handful of extra degrees of Fahrenheit can make much difference. These are our hot days. But the climate is not without the charm of variety. Sometimes we wake In the morning to the sound of rushing waters. Theae is a cascade in the sky. As much water faUs in four hours as would make wet weather in England for a month. Then out comes the sun, and the city Is one hot vapour bath. Everything is permeated by the steam, and your clothes mildew as you sit stiU and groan. Towards evening you take advantage of a lull and go out to dinner, borne like a Guy Fawkes upon a bamboo chair, with two coolies staggering and gasping under your John Bullish ponderosity. You find every one assembled in white jackets and white trousers in a large suite of rooms containing 20 open windows and 20 open doors. Suddenly the skies open and the deluge descends, the accompanying tempest sweeps fiercely through every aperture, the doors slam and the verandah blinds clash, rheumatisms and agues riot boisterously about; while in mockery of the windy turmoil the colie, who has crouched in one corner of theroom absorbed in the ecstacies of an opiumdream, continues to puU his ordinary gentle pull at the madly swaying punkab. Then you ask those white clad convives how they can face such a douche bath of draughts insuch feeble clothing, and they confess the horrible hypocrisy of the Hongkong toilette. Underneath those thin white garments every one of them, except the inexperienced recorder of these first impressions, is clad from throat to too in an undercovering of thick fiannel. They promise us four months of beautiful winter weath-r, mildly bracing as an English spring. You might as well thus try to console thin Ice palace that was built upon the Neva. Before these winter months come we shal be racked with rheumatisms and expended by furnace heats. Yet Hongkong is very healthy. Scarcely any Eng. lish die here. True; but there Is an enormous consumption of quinine and blue pill, and when these lose their effect most Englishmen take to a Peninsular and Oriental steamer. It is a mere question, then, of a preposition whether they are to be carried off, from, or on the island. With such weather we must not wonder that dysentery and diarrhoca and ague are rather prevalent among the seamen and marines who are in the ships and in the fort up the river; or that the marines who on the 1st of June passed many hours in the paddy fields up to their waists in stagnant water contribute la-rgely to the sick list, nor am I astonished to hear that the large military hospital upon this island has rather more than its average number of occupants. On the other hand, we must acknowledge that all the diseases in this climate are below the waist. We never hear that hacking cough which runs like the fire of an awkward squad through the congregation of an English church. I brought out a model of this truly British pest with me, but left it behind in the Mediterranean. I cannot report very favourably of the " fauna" or the "flora" of the island. Ornamental trees grow very well when planted and nurtured, and some flowers may be culled in a distant nook called the " Happy Valley," a spot hard border. ing upon a wretched village, and a squalid population ; but the natural vegetation seems to be a coarse moss, eaten by no quadruped. At any rate, I never saw any four-footed thing grazing upon that green mountain, which rises in full aspect of my window, and upon which as the rains commence I can see the torrents form. Sometimes there is a buffalo seen on the island, but he is usually on his way to the slaughter-house. A cow I never saw; yet there is milk. But that milk is used by few nnd shuddered at by many. Whence It comes is the darkest mystery of Hongkong economics. The only qtuadruped that could be supposed to produce it is the pig-for pigs do exist in the island; but it is whispered as a caution, and with oblique glance at the milk jug, that the Chinese matron herself-but enough; very few people take milk except that which is sent out in tins. The horse exists in a high state of domesticity. As in Attica, so in Hongkong there is small footing and little forage for horses. In both localities the animal was useless and expensive, and greatly in vogue. Strepsiades at Hongkong dreams as constantly of horses as did Phidippides at Athens. A badly bred Arab worth 201. at Algiers and 101. at Tattersall's is worth 2501. at Victoria. There is a racecourse round which he will run once a-year, and there are two miles of tolerable road along which he may be ridden daily by a long-booted and hunting whip-bearing proprietor, not scoreing exiguis equitare campis. The buffalo snd the horse, therefore, exlst in a highly artificial condition upon this Island; but I could not afford to exclude them from my notice of animated nature in Hongkong, seeing that the materials for observation on that subject are so very limited. In recompense for the small interest which the island can afford to the equine, bovine, and ovine genera, it is pleasant to be able to testify that the entomologist and the man curious in reptilia ray find constant amuse. ment. The winged cookroach is so finely developed and so rich in fecundity that specimens may be seen - I am by no means prepared to become the advocate of Hongkong as the English commercial station, but surely. after making all fair allowance for the very natural and honest prejudices of this reviewer, it is aburd to speak of this great oity &nd crowded harbour as "a harbour for out laws and smugglerr'-a clty which contaIns 60,000 inhabit. ants, before which shipping to the amount of 800,000 tons cast anchor, and which, so long as we havo no other possession, must be the bonding _wrehouse of all our exports to Ching. W, le I am akin of this artlele I must add that it is not fair in a puelic ter, in discussing the ques. tion of the oum trade, to Ignore these important and noto rious hao: vat opium Is most extensively grown In hina, ^ atprbo verT far helo'w thatwhlhisbl pddfor the Indian opiuni; tISStilt is smoked openly by mandrns at the Court and by judges on t. benh, and that not one word appears in any pubil. der.6en aainst tha traflio since the oour2e of xb^ange ba ture In 1bvour of the Chinse and thi drug hs paid fo? tn silk and teas insed ot In silver. I am no mzer, an aviot for opiuma smuinkg than I am for nndua peference for H[ongkoug, but I am a srnuous aidvocate for giving the pblicb the whole truth so far as we van obtain lt. at all times and ia the most handsome drawingrooms, crawling over the floors and tables by day, in size like mice, and banging against the lamp glasses at night, in Size like birds. The spiders are so colossal that you wonder how they can have fed themselves to such a size, and yet left so many flies undevoured. The mosquitos are so clever in insinuating themselves through your fortre3s of gauze, and they so keenly cut slices out of your fleshy parts, that you hail the dawn of day with the sensations of an Abyssinian ox. The serpent tribe find the island favourable to their growth, for it was only a short time since that a Regulus, in the uniform of a British Colonel, was brought to a stand by a cobra five feet long-" scrpcfls portentosm magnitudinis." He was destroyed, happily, without any loss on the side of the British. The victory was rendered to an ungrateful country, for the last mail brings inteligence that the field allowanco is stopped. The officers see their dollars pass in this dear colony as shillings, and they gently complain that it is "hard lines." I confess I think so too. It is a small economy at best. I have already spoken of the fatness and fertility of the Hongkong rats. When Minutius, the dictator, was swearing Flamintus in as his master of the horse, we are told by Plutarch that a rat chanced to squeak, and the superstitious people compelled both officers to resign their posts. Office would be held under great uncertainty in HRongkong if a similar superstition prevailed. Sir John Bowring has just been swearing in General Aahburnham as member of the Colonial Council, and if the rats were silent they showed unusual modesty. They have forced themselves, however, into a State paper. Two hundred rats are destroyed every night in the gaol. Each morning the Chinese prisoners see with tearful eyes and watering mouths a pile of these delicacies cast out In waste. It is as if Christian prisoners were to see scores of white sucking-pigs tossed forth to the dogs by Mahomedan gaolers. At last they could refrain no longer. Daring the punishment of tail cutting, which follows any infraction of prison discipline, they first attempted to abstract the delicacie3. Foiled In this, they took the more manly course. They indited a petition in good Chinese, proving from Confucius that it is sinful to cast away the food of man, and praying that the meat might be handed over to them to cook and eat. This is a fact, and if General Thompson doubts it I recommend him to move for a copy of the correspondence. I may not, however, close this gossiping column of first impressions without saying that, despite the difficulties of climate and of space, the Europeans in Hongkong do not seem very unhappy. Colonial politics interpose their difficulties as colonial politics always wiUl; but, these apart, I know no place where social intercourse is more frank and cordiaL The common tie of civilization is a common bond of brotherhood. Jumm 24,1 P.x. The Singapore starts for England in an hour. The mail from England has not arrived. We hear that the Shannon was to leave Singapore on the lthI but as she has not come in Lord Elgin may possibly have remained for further communication with Lord Canning. There is a rumour prevalent among the Chinese-although, as thev say, "no man can talkee true"-that the Emperor of China, terrified by the insurrectionary movements and the sufferings of his people from scarcity in the North, had abandoned his throne. I believe this rumotir to be altogether unfounded. WVe have here the Pekin Gazette up to the 18th of May, at which time the announcements show that the Court routine was uninterrupted. We have the rumour from Shanghai, and I think it must be older than the date of our last Gazette The Chinese are constantly putting false reports in circulation.
BXTBAOBDINARY OOLOURED MBTEOBS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I venture once more to trespass on your valuable time and paper to communicate the following extraordinary phenomena to the public, since, if similar meteors should have been seen in different latitudes, such registers may tend to usefol results, as wel as to solve the long-disputed question of the cause of meteors. Mondav, being the 10th of August, astronomers were all on the lookout for the perlodical faUing stars. I began my watch on the 9th, when some few briUliant examples ocourred. On the 10th they were more numerous, as also on the 1lth; but on the 12th, that is, last night, they assumed very unusual forms and colours. Being at Ostend I returned late to a good position above the eea, and watcbed them great part of the night. Many hundreds feU in various directions, bnt particularly towards S.W. and W., not N.W. as usuaL They didnot in general move fast and leave the white trains behind them, as is unsal, but descended slowly with abright yellow flame; others were splendidly crimson, and some right blue and purple. This fact is very curious, as favouring the hypotheSs of ignited gases, adopted by M. De Luc, of Geneva ; and it would be interesting to ascertain whether this colouration of the meteors has been observed in other places far from the Influence of the sea. I have asecertained that during the whole of this month meteors have been numerous all along the Rhine and in Germany. Such numbers have not faUen since the 10th of August, 1811, nor have we any record of such a quantity as on the present occasion, extending over four days consecutivelv, and exhibiting such very brilliant and diversified tints of l:ght. CoUateraUy with these meteors the following phenomena should be noticed, proving the highly electric state of the air. In the storm which raged in Holland on the 5th of July the hailstones were largerthan pigeons'eggs, and brok-e nearly all the windows in Arnheim. The same occurred at Spa on the 5th of August, when ever pane of glass exposed to the hail was beaten to pieces. All the electrical instruments indicate a high positive charge. A trombc or waterspout was witnessed by me in the distance on the 1lth. The showers have not cooled the air, as they usually do. A new weathereock with several horszontal and vertical fans and; wheels, which I have put up in order to test the wlnd, shows that the varying gales have not blown horizontaly, but slanting, or In undulations, and the thermometer has risen again to Indian beat. AU these circumstances polnt to some cause of the changes of temperature not at aU depending on the place of the sun, and which future observations may more frUy develope, if astronomers will accurately observe them in various parts of the world. We may possibly derive therefrom wba' has long been a desideratum in science-a table of true indications of the changes of weather. I sobmnit aU or any of these observations to your bet'er judgment for insertion, and have the honour to re-nain Your obedient servant. T. FORSTER. I Brussels, Aug. 13.

Reinforoements for the 74th Highlanders are aso to be held in readiness to (mbark for India. The depot of the 3d battalion of the 60th Royal Rides, under the command of Captain J. P. Battersley, the head. quarters of which have embarked for India, is ordered to move from Dublin and join the provisional battalion at Chatham. The depOt of the 7th Royal Fusileers is also ordered to proceed from Portsmouth to Chatham this day. The following officers have joined their respective Indian depots at Chatham garrison:-Lieutenant T. Madden, 24'h IRegiment; Ensign F. Venour, 27th Enniskillens; Ensign H. C. Talbot, 43d Light Infantry; and Ensign W. L. K. OgUvy, lst battalion 60th Royal Rifles. Fifty-three men of theo3st regiment embarked on Saturday at Liverpool on board the screw steam transport Lebanon, which yesterday took on board 250 men of the 92d and 2d regiments. She is expected to sail for Gibraltar to-day or to-morrow. The screw steamer City of Manchester, takenupbytheEast Indaa Companyto convey troops for Calcutta, left Liverpool on Saturday afternoon to embark the troops at Gravesend, where sbe is expected to arrive to-morrow. Though only taken up on Saturday week, and surveyed on Fziday, she left on Saturday with all her stores on board, and 1,000 tons of coals. In order to give her full supplies of coals, her owners, on Saturday, despatched the steamer Bosphorus, which they have purchased for the purpose, from South. ampton to St. Vincent, there to await her arrival. On Friday evening 10 officers and 173 rank and file of the 60th Rifles, and 2 officers and 67 sergeants and privates of the 56th Regiment, embarked at Kingstown for India. The steam transport Australian left Spithead about 4 p.m. on Saturday for Calcutta, with the following officers and men, constituting the head-quarters of the 42d Highlanders: -Lieutenant-Colonels Cameron and Thorold, Captains Leod, Drysdale, and Grove; Lieutenants Lawson, Far. quharson, Cockburn, Bramley and Bosworth; Surgeon Fur. long, Paymaster Bazalgette, Lieutenant and Adjutant Wood, Ensign Cecly, Assistant-Surgeon Hooper, Quartermaster M'Gregor, 24 sergeants, 17 drummers, 12 corporals, and 237 privates. The Dutchman steamship disembarked part of the 68th Foot at Portsmouth on Saturday morning from the Ionian Islands. The Victoria steamship arrived at Portsmouth on Saturday (with Artillery for India) to ship ammunition and stores for the Indian army. The Sydney steamship arrived at Spithead on Saturda7 morning, from Woolwich, and proceeded direct for Indii with Royal Artillery. The Chersonese, Queen of the South, and Hursutia steamships will embark the 44th and 66th Regiments at Portsmouth for India to-morrow. A battalion of the Guards (Scots Fusileers) will proceed to Portsmouth from the camp, and form part of the permanent garrison of that fortress on the 1st proximo. The Leopard, 18, paddle frigate, Captain Wainwright, arrived at Spithead at 9 o'clock on Priday night to report the loss of the first 335 milea of the Atlantic telegraph cable. She remains, and will be joined by the Cyclops. The Black Eaglo and Banshee, Admiralty steam yachts, arr:ved at Portsmouth on Friday evening from Woolwich. The Falcon, 17, Commander Campion, went into Portsmouth harbour on Saturday to refit. The Lords of the Admiralty were expected to arrive at Portsmouth last night, and to commencoe their inspection of that establishment this morning. The Sarah Sands steatmship embarked the head-quarters of the 54th Foot at Portsmouth on Saturday, and will sail with them this morning at daylight for India. The James Baines and Champion of the Seas, clippers, having on board the 97th Highlanders, the 20th Foot, and part of the 42d Highlanders, were toved by the steamtugs Resolute and Blazer to 48 deg. 40 min. north, and 9 deg. west, and left them all well on the 11th, except a south-west wind, which was the worst they could possibly have met with, but plenty of sea room. The gunnery ship Cambridge, 78, Captain Jerninghain, from Spithead, returned to Plymouth on Friday, and went up Hamoaze. The paddlewheel stearuvessol Devastation, 6, Comimander Marshall, from Spithead, which arrived at Plymouth on Wednesday, sailed on Saturday with the floating battery Terror, Captain Frederick Hutton, in order to assist her to Bermuda, where she is to be stationed. The steam storeship Dee has arrived at Woolwich from the western yard, and is again under the sheers to embark a cargo of steam gear for the same destination. The Queen of Holland is to embark from Woolwich to. day for Holland.
TO THE EDrTOR OF THE TIMBS. Sir,-The Great Western Railway meeting has taken place, and nothing more desponding could be said than that it hasleft the company's affairs to take their chance, for this is the true interpretation of that inaction which was evidently the effect not of confidence in the management, but of want of confidence in the remedy. Although non-interference on such grounds is most disheartening it is useless to dwell upon it, but it may be use. ful to discuss questions of practical import arising out of it. There can be no doubt that Mr. Malins' motion for a Com mittee of Investigation was lost for waut of a little organization among the proprietors. Why, tben, should we not now remedy this defect, and institute a committee of shareholders to exercise independent observation, and wait foran opportanityof interferlng advantageously in the affairs of the company ? This committee nmay be of the utmost utility at the next half-yearly meeting, perhaps, to bring forward a similar motion with better deliberation and more authority. It is, at all events, necessary for testing the promise given by the chairman that the board would readily make way for the introduction of four men of business having the confidence of the proprietors- a promise which had considerable effect in dividing the party about to support Mr. MaIins' motion, but which will, of course, be utterly inoperative unless acted upon; and experience has taught us that without organization the proprietors are never provided with a candidate to propose against the merest nonentity nominated by the directors. In the meantime It would probably have inflience eniough to obtain the circulation of the report, as well as the statement, suffi. clently long before the meeting to afford a better opportunity of determining on the course to be adopted. Infortu. nately we want the man to gather round him the materials for this committee. The force and influence which should distinguish him were not exhibited by any one who took part in the proceedings to-day ; and most unfortunately we have, I fear, dnven frora us one who showed himself as willing as he was fitted by his influenee and business abilities to undertake the duty. Mr. Mtiles was in the thoughts of many to-day, who were ashamed to revive the desertion which he encountered when his great influence was devoted to their service. I cannot refrain from adverting to one feature in to-day's proceedings which will astonish the rallway world as much as it did the proprietors present. I refer to the an. nouncement from the chair that the board had deteriineoa to present Mr. Saunders, the socretary of the compaRy, with 5,OO1. for extra services! Now, this announcement is coincident with a depression which must be painfully felt by all of us, and which it is to be feared has brought ruin to .many. And what are the grounds for this unseasonable liberality ? Is Mr. Saunders underpaid ? His salary i3 2,5001. per annum, with, I believe, a mansion in addition. Is it supposed that the secretary of the Great Western Railway Company can have time for duties in excess of his office ? It has generally been feared that the interests of the company saffer from so much official business already devolving upon him. Have his services been so beneficial to the proprietary as to need the reward of this special liberality? In the opinion of the proprietors, often presented to the directors, as well as of persons conversant with railway matters generally, Mr Saunders has been held mainly responsible for those monster schemes, unprofitable leases, and enormous legal expenditure which have proved so disastrous to our interests. This subject was left in a very obscure condition; and I doubt if half of those present understood that this unsanuc. tioned remuneration had been actually paid. The whole business was brought forward in a manner which could only heighten the dissatisfaction of the shareholders, and confirm the impression that the board are overweighted by their secretary. Had this fact been noticed in the report, and had the com . mittee of proprietors to which I have referred been in existence, some stronger opposition would have been made than the unmistakable manifestation of disgust with which the announcement was reoeived, and a more determined effort would have been made to do that which now remains to be done-to Insist upou the restltution of this ujustifl. able misappropriation. The magnitude of the Great Western Rdlway Compays intereats renders its depresdon a natonal calamity. Is there no one to undertake the Jaudable effort of rescuing it from the evil Into which It hag been datgged Could sch a man be found, we might at least hope to eee intelligent dellbertlon take the place of the lamentable and hifruitl prooeedings of such mueetings as hat held toay, and an InluentIl check impoDd upon the management *-en without the formla appointment of a committee of investigation, though it ha maost likely that this would soon follow, I am.

COMAfITTEE FOR PRJMTLEGES. 4T> - r rrOITT.CV nlV T-IIT?nr) ArP 1-1 'THE: C.R:.A'r SiI:\VWSIIUlY CASE. Their Lordships resumed the hearing of this case this morning, at a quarter to 11 o'clock. 1'he ATToitXNEY-GEKEIAL then proceeded to address tho comnmittee on behalf of the Crown, and sfaid that he should confine the observations he was about to make to the sub. stantlal objections wvhich bad beeni made by the parties opposing the claim, and he should therefore pass by all tho d=iiulties which had been raised with respect to the legality of the descent of the esrldoin down to Bertram Arthur, the last earl. The first point to wbich he woull call ttse attentiox of the couninittee was the suggestion that there were other descendants of Sir John of Albright,n, by his first marriage besides those mentioned in the claimiant's pedli. gree. Without referring to the deeds of 17(X) and 17IS, he was of opinion that the two inpqisitions vhich had been put in proved that Sir Jolhi of Graiton was the eldest son of Sir John of Albrighton. The will of the latter which had been produced by the clainlant stated that he had three sons, and he considered this to be a proof with regard to that point. But other documents had been put in by the other side in which other children were men. tiuned, and the inscription upon the ancienit tomb in the church of Broornsgrove had not becn ascertained with any. thing like satisfaction. This was a most miaterial pioint, as the authenticity of the tomb was admrlitted, and it ili ht be di,covered from it whether there had been any other male is'ue of this marriage beside thoese n enti- ued by the claimant. The deeds of 1700 and 1718 d:d not clear up this point satisfactorily, and he was therefore of opinion that this case should not he finally decided until it had been ascertained whether the inFcriltion was legible or not. hI'e next suggestion was that John of Oraftun had a ton Gilbert besides those mentioned by the claimaant's pedigree. This suggestion appeared to hinm to have been roved bya deed of settlement executed during the life. time of Gilbert, but, on the other hand, he was nlot mentioned in a patent of precelence granted to George as the youngest son of an earl, and therefore the fair inference was that he was not alive when it was granited, an,d as he wias not then of age it was mnost likely he died unwarried. Ile now caume to the question of legitimuacy of Jd,hn of Salwarp. The only thing wlhich appeared to ca,t any suspicion upon the legitimacy of his birth was an erased inote of interrogation at the end of his name in the visitatiuon pedigree ia 16;23. It had been suggested that this note oi interrogation had been erased when it became inm,ortant to tie1 Bishop of Salisbury to have it struck out, but. he did not thiink that was a fair assumption, and in his opiniion the niote of interrogaticon was placed at the end of his name omore as a uiatter for further inquiry than with the intenition of throwing any doubt upon his legitimisacy. as:d he considered tbat it had been erased by the same autiori-y fromii which it proceeded. There were several circumstances which ltd him to conisider John of Salwarp to lhave beeri legitimate. For instance, the Duke of Shrewsbtiry in his deed lad placed Sir John of Lacock as one of the thrce heals of the farily, which ho could not have been if iis ancestor had been illegitimate. Independently of that. their lordshij s would recollect that John of Salwarp succeeded as heir of his brother Gilbert. Ile did not, therefore, feel any doubt on the part of the Crown as totthe legitmuiiacy of John of Salwarp. He woild not dismuiss this part of the case, however, without mentioning the fact that his fatlher and mother both mentioned him in their wills as their youngest son. lie would then proceed to another great point in the case-nanely, the alleged extinction of ttil descendants of the first marriage of Sherrington of Rtudge, which was disputed by the opposing p)arties. He could only say that upon this point there was a strong imnl prcssion upon his mind that time ought to he aflorded for fulrther searches to be niade. Having gone through the eviderice, lie ca0ie to the conclusion that there was satisfactory evide,mco of the death without issue of all the sous of bYherrinititon, excepting tobert, John, Ilenry, and Thomas. Roberts name appeared in the benefactors, which stated that he went to Jreland and died, but it did not state whether he died unmarried or without issue. There was n,m other evidence vith respect to bim, and he should therefore suggest tbat further search ought to be made with respect to this point. As regarled John and 13enry, said to have dif(l in battle without issue, he coiisidered that as they were smlidiers, and only 24 )ears of age at the tiuie of tbhic death, time probability that they died without issue was great. The next person was Thomas,who played a nnmch more iw,, portanit part, and who did niotappear in the Benefactors' pedigree, which appeared to detrp.ct very much from the value and reliance ta be placed upon that book. Thomiias appeared to have been in a very husible position in life, aiid thIerefore as it wonld seem beyond a doubt that he was omimitted fromii the pedigree, whichwould thusbecomen 4tiunfaithiful acc unt of the family. Thomas appeared to have imiarried, asil thiebaptism of Frances, the daughter of Thomas and his wife, had been proved. Ile was buried in 16J2. lie then caine to a will of a relative of the family, dated in It54, in which a son of Thomiias, named Simerrington, was iiitrodliced. Thomnas was then proved to have been a mnarried Omiani with a sun in existence in 1(54. Thorias was evidenitly in indigent circumstances, andi was an outcast fromn his faildly, anid Sir Gilbert must intentionally have left him out. It would not therefore bo unlikely that his descen-lants had beeni wilfully lost sight of. 'The evidence which wvas given yesterday showed that a Slmerrington married Sarah Squire, iho appeared to have besn the daughter of a maltbter in huiiiblo circumstances, and they subsequently hadi a soi arid daughter. There being the sanie names in the famiily-tho daughter being called hlurial, an old family niamiie of the Talbots, and the son Sherrington, he considered that the Sherrington who married Miss Squire niust be considered as the son of ThoDnsa until the contrary be proved, amid that at all events further inquiries ought to be inistituited with respect to this point. He now caine to the next person of lomportance-nausely, Charles the brother of Sir Joln of Lacock. That pierson was stated by the claimaiixnt to have died without issue, but the parties inl opposition had produced a wtil of that Charles, in which he left certain pro- *erty to his son Gilbert. e thought that there was very little doubt but that the Charles Talbot imientioned in the pedigree was this Charles Talbot, thie testator. Ile then passed to another so-called brother of Sir ,lohn of Lacock(ilbert, anid in this branch of the inquiry there appeared to be considerable dillicuity. The only opinion on the part of the Crown that lie could express was that there was a secemslty for a further inqluiry upon this poiiit. The birth of this Gilbert had been proved, as weill as the miarriage of a person of that namne with Ann Ilytbe, in Auguist, 18G. Tho representation supported hv evidence on the part of the claimant was that ths Gilherti'.dbit was the descendant ofa junior branch of the family. Thus two Gill)erte were proved to bave existed at the same tiimie, blit both sides claimed the G;ilbert wlio niarrled Anii lithe. ''he smiatter was thus left iil doubt. Ile had now exhausted time points in the pedigree. The proceedings in 171i might either confirm or throw doubt upon the opinions which they might form from the pedigree. Ho would then wnerion two conclusions at which he had arrived, the first of whiclh was that he was satisfied that Wiliam of Whittington was the father of the bishop, and then that the bishop was married, Rand had a son Charles, who subsequently becauoe Ch'ancellor, and who was the ancestor of the claimisant; lint what he was not at all satisfied of was the extinction of the innisrmediate branches between Sir John of Lacock aisd the bislhop. He now came to the imiportant proceedings of 171', I is conclusions were these,-that, altlioulgh it abundantiy appeared that the Duke recognized the bishop as a kiesnian, vet still he did not know in what relation tho bibhnp stood with respect to the title. He wished to usake an important observation, which was, that the son of tie IDuke of Norfolk, who had access to all the family papers, had iiot produced any of theiii. It was perfectly clear, inl his opinion, that the conumittee in 1718 liad nsot beens satisfied of the truth of what time bishop h.ad stated to be the state of the family, and had therefore left the matter of the pedigree open, as it was not of imuclh conres ience as the estates were t s descend with the title, any claimant of which imiust sibsstantiH.to that claimi. Considering, tisen, the failure of thse hishops to prove his pedigree to the satisfaction either of the duke or afterwards of the cominsittee, he had come to the conclusion that the fullest possible opportunity of seeking fuirtlher information should be given before a decision should he coue to. Lord C m mmn asked if the Attorney-Genieral proposel, on the part of the Crown, to institute further inquiries before the committee casne to a decision. The ATTORNEY-GEN FRsIe. said lie did. The LORDI CIANCELLOR said, in his opinion, the question before the committee was not only whether the claiumant had made hiniself out to be in the line of descent, but also that there were no others before him. Lord S r. LEofARD'S asked if the Crown had as yet made any Inquiries. The Arro R.N -GGgsERAL said no inquiiries liad be!n made as yet on the part of the Crown. He had onily seen the evidence which had been adduced on both sides, and he had sisade such observations thereupon as had suggested them. selves to him. The L,m*RI) ClhAEfrElLOR said both sides ought to be satisfied with the course the Attorney-General hal adopted. The Attorney-General then writhdrew, aind, after some consultation, The Lorc) CHiANCELLoR said,-This case lias been very fully and elaborately discussed, and it is perhaps as Important as any case of the kind that has ever come before this House. All that we have to decide upon is the claimi to the earidom, for, although attached to the title of Earl of Shrewibury are very large estates, yetthe Hosise has nothing to do with that. I cannot help expressing the gratitude I feel, and which their Lordships mulst entertain, towards the Attorney-General, and to the counsel on either side, for the valuable assistance they have rendered and the lucid manner in which they have argued the case. As it has proceeded, it has no doubt made an impression on your Lordsbips, and, speaking for myself, with every wish to decide the question as quickly and as correctly as possible, I do think that we should not be doing justice or performing our duty to the parties in this important case if we did not take time to consider our decision, As delay might bring forward matter that might throw light on the question, and, as by pondering over it we shall be able to arrive it at a more satisfactory result than we can by deciding it now, I move that this committee shall adjcurn sine (lie-that Is to say, until the next session of Parliament. Lord ST. LEONTAnI's haviiig concurred, The committee then adjourned. Further consideration adjourned sine (ic accordingly. TUB DE SCAhES PrEERAE.

INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT, hidey, Aug. 14. The CHIEF COMMISSIONXR sat to-day for bail cases andI motions, as also for the disposal of some other cases which had been previously heard. LN TUE IArrTTE. OF I1ARD)ICUK EVANS. This insolvent, a young man, temporary clerk in the Audit-office, whose case was before the Court on a former occasion, appeared for adjudication. Mr. NIcIuo s and Mr. REED, who had opposed for eight tradesmen residing at Cambridge, prayed the judgment of the Court. On the schedule the debts, nearly all contracted :.t Cam. bridge, amounted to g31. lSs. lOd., and numbered G8 creditors. The opposing creditors were Messrs. Moyes, proprietors of the Bull Tavern, Cambridge; Messrs. Bacon, tobacconists; Mr. Bentley, bootmaker; Messrs. Hudson, "college cook ;" Mt r. Peters, jeweller; Mr. Parfitt, tailor; Mr. Pratt, horsedealer; and M;r. R<owe, wine-merchant. 'he case stood over to serve creditors, and no further evidence was now eiven. ! Tho CHIEF GoMMilSSSoNER in expressing his opinion dwelt upon the principal feature of the case. Ie said the I insolvent had got deeply into debt at Cambridge while an undergraduate, As he could not pay the creditors complained of his conduct. The history of the young man was a very common one; he had lived at a rate beyond his means, and the parties who had suffered the most were his relatives; in fact, his family. After he had been three years atCambridgehis parents,who were far frombeing opulent,bis lather being a clergyman in London, disposed of some funds under their marriage settlement. What was now complained of was that this circumstance had not operated, as might have been expected, in making him prudent in contracting fresh debts. On the contrary, he incurred debts faster than he did before, and he and some of the creditors who had been paid, no doubt, relied on a second payment of the debts by the father; but it could not he done. After the Insolvent I left the University a situation was obtained for him in a I Government offce at 100/. a-year. It would lhave been better if his creditors bad let him alone for a time, but the landlord of the Bull served him with a writ, on which the insolvent's attorney went down to Cambridge, offering to set apart 501. a-year out of the 1001., and the matter was entertained; but according to the evidence the Bull was "stern," and it went off. As nothing had been arranged the insolvent was arrested by the hotelkeeper, and, being in prison, the question was how much longer he was to remain there. He (tbe Chief Commissioner) could not help saying that there had been want of caution by the insolvent in contracting the debts after his friends had paid them once. But was there no want of caution on the part of the creditors ? He thought that mnost of tho want of caution was on their part. There was a jeweller for 501. for a necklace, rings, and other things, which had been given away as presents. It had been said that as the insolvent knew his circumstances, I and that the tradesmen had an oprtunitu of knowing his means, but some had been paid before, and no doubt they rested on the second chance of payment, and all looked for payment to other means. He (the Chief Commissioner) must say that there was no circumstance of discredit in the case on 'he Insolvent except the circumstance of getting Iinto d.bt. There was no misrepresentation made by hitn or any statement to get into debt. Hle asked a jeweUer for an emerald ring, and he was fool enough to give it to him. Then there was 56(. for cigars, which the creditor let him have, and he had no right to complain of the lo. Some of the creditors had been paid before, and the parties knew his position and went on. It was on account of these absurd debts that tho insolvent had come to the court, and several names had been given in, but only one creditor, Mr. Bacon, had attended to give evidence. What he (the Chief Commissioner) chiefly wished to notice was that there bad been no discredit on the young man exccept getting into debt; he was a very foolish fellow, because other persons gave him credit, to get further goods, and they had been very stupid in letting him have the goods. As to the means of payment there WaS a circumstance in the case which should be mentioned. It seemed that aU payments were made through the tutor, and, as stated by bMr. Bacon, the custon:-rs were not pressed. | If the tutors got the money the tradesmen were paid, but they never asked. What a state of business I It showed how very easy these people were in letting young men at the University get into their debt. After alluding to the various creditors whose names had been given as opposing, the Commissioner said he could not say the insolvent was free from blame, but he thought the creditors were equally to blame, and, therefore, in the adjudication he should only notice the complaint of the shoemaker and tailor who opposed, and it would be for them to do any. thing, if they thought proper, to put the judgment into force. His Ho1os oR gave a iudgment of four months under the discretionary clause from the 24th of June, at the suit of Mr. Bentley and Mr. Parfitt. The insolvent was discharged forthwith as to the other debts. ISN RE CILARLOTTE SOIWtAN. This was an application for bail. Mr. F. A. Levns, attorney, appeared for Mr. Birkett, the detaining creditor. The insolvent is a married woman. She was in prison for 40s. damages by consent and 801. costs in an action of slander. 'be action was heard in May, and as the insolvent hal about 401. a-year fromn rents it was suggested that she should find ball for 201., and go out of prison while the rents were coUceted to pay the debts. The COURT accepted the bail, and recommended the per. son (h£rs. Eldridge) who recelved the rents to paylthe money into Court, or she would get into Chancery.
JUIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Saturdaay, Aug. 15. (Before Mr. BODrIN..) Thocard Payne, 18, desribed as an actor, and of superior education, was indicted for stealing four sbirts, tho property of Charlotte Ensall. Mr. Ribton appeared for the prosecution; Air. Metcalfe for the prisoner. The prosecutrix was a widow, carrying on the business of a linendraper in Drury-lane, and on the 2d of July the prisoner called at her shop and selected four shirts, which he desired might be sent, with the bill, to No. 10, Holywellstreet, where he was living. The prosecutrix sent them by her servant, with positive instructions that she was not to leave them without the money, as she never gave credit to any one. The servant followed him to a house in Holywellstreet, when he took her bundle and told her to run back and fetch him two more shirts. When she retuirned the prisoner was gone and the shirts too. She saw him some days afterwards in Whitehorse-yard, when he ran away; but subsequently she saw him in a ublichouse, got a policeman, and gave him into custody. Hie then requested her to go wsth him to the Strand Theatre to see his father, but she would not do so. The prosecutrix, in her cross-examination, admitted that sho went to the Strand Theatre and saw the prisoner's father, who is the lessee of that establishment, but denied that she went there to obtain payment for the goods. She wanted to know where the prisoner was to be found. Mr. METCALFE, for the defence, arged that the matter ought to have been treated as one of debt, and that the prosecution had been instituted to "screw" the money out of the father-a highly respectable person-when it was found that it could not be got out of the son. The prisoner had been leading a dissolute life, and had got into estravagant habits: and though he had done wrong in getting these things in tho way be bad, still it was but a fair concludon that he did so in the belief that he should get the money from his father, oud had not been actuated by the felonious intention imputed to him by thgs indztment. He besought the jury tf well consider before they consigned the prisoner to utter disgrace and ruithjst on the threshold of lfe, as it was merely a question of intent, and a case as much of debt as of fraud. hIr. eOkiTIN told the jury that if upon the evidenco they thought the prisoner by a trick got possession of the prosecutrix's goods without her consent, to eappropriate them to imsolf, they must find him guilty. Any doubt they might entertain the prisoner must have the benefit of. The jury found the mrisoner Gt silesh Mr. Nl TCA,LFE said the prisoner had been in prison si weeks. The Court might take that into consideration in passing sentence. Mr. Payne, the prisoner's father, in aosuer to the CaiRaT said ida son had been leading a very irregular life latterly and he had done all he could to reclaim him. He promised to furnish hun with everything he might require if he woula leave London, andbthereias an arrangement for him to go to Southampton. The prosecutrio applied to him at te theatre for the money, but these proceedings had been hastily taken, or it would have been paid. ThieprisonTr pleaded noGuilty" to a second charge of a simoileyars kind. bur hlr. P'ayne said he would send himn out to Australia at the expration of the sentence the Court might impose. Mr. BoSalter sentenced the prisoner to six mothes' hard Caroline aoley, 1S, was convicted of picking the pocket of a lady named Blanche Vivian, at the Zoological Gardens, on the lXth of July. There was reasen to believe that she had been in Westminster Prison, Hut dates could not he given. The paisoner did not deny it. She was sentenced to one year's hard labour. Mr. Salter prosecuted; Mr. Ribton was for the prisoner. John hMacarthy, 19), was indicted for having stolen an iron safe, containing the sum of 261f., an,d l00lib. of bacon, the property and money of James Hunter and others, the mnemhers of an association called the Imperial loan Society. Erd. fPladt appeared for the prosecution; the prisoner was not defended. On the morning of the 17th of July, about 5 o'clock, the constable on duty in Chapel-street, Tottenham-cocrt-road saw the prisoner loitering about in a suspicious manner with a truck, which at length he took into Alfred-mews, and left there. On seeing the prisoner at a later hour he took him into custody to account for his possession of the track, and it had then transpired that the office of the Imperial Loan Society had been broken into, and an iron safe, containing 2611., belonging to the society, and a quantity of bacon, had been removed from a room, in which every. thing had been left secure on the preceding night, and were found lying in the passage. Attempts had been made to force open tnie safe, but it would seem that tire thieves were disturbed in their operations, and had to make a hasty retreat, leaving the booty behind them. The evidence to connect the prisoner with the robbery was this,-that he was loitering with the truck close to the offce at the time the offence was committed, ready, it was assumed, to carny off theplunder; that he denied having had the truck in his possession when accased of being concerned in tle robbervy that bis boots corresponded with mud marks of feet in the passage; and a statement made by him to Inspector CheckLey as foUows :-" I was led into it by Sealey; he was the principal one, and if he had not met me I should not have been in trouble now, and this is my first offence-I am certain of it. I have got a poor old mother, and she will get on but poorly without me. Baines and Caloraft were in it, but did not speak tome about it." This statement was made by the prisoner when he was charged with being concerned, written down by the inspector, and read over to him, and he Aproved it and said it was all correct. e prisoner in his defence said he had borrowed the ruck o a young man he knewv, at the request of two young men whose names he had given, and they were to pay him to do something for them; but as to any robbery he knewP nothing whatever about one, and was as innocent of the charge as any one in court. What wa meant by " fist c fence" was, that it was the first time he had been in trouble, that was what he really did say. The jury found the prisoner *7uilty. Inspector Checkley said he had known him to be the asso. ciate of bad characters, some of whom had been transported, but he had never been in custody. Mr. BODKIN said he agreed with the verdict, and sen. tenced the prisoner to 12 months' bard labour. (Before Mr. CREASY,) WVSiliam West, 33, and Edwrard Skinner 25, were indicted for stealing 27 copies of The Times, tdho property Of Charles MIosley and another, the employers of West. MIr. Orridge prosecuted; MIr. Sleigh appeared for West) and MIr. Cooper for Skinner. Frosm the evidence of Police-constable Franklin, 72 F, it appeared that, from information ho received, he, on the morning of the 7th inst., was induced to watch a cart be. longing to Messrs. Mosley, news agents, of Catherine-street. West drove the cart towvards Charing-cross, and stopped at the corner of Hungerford-street ; he then went to the corner of a court and handed a bundle of papers to the other prisoner, and then drove away. The constable followed Skinner, and asked him what he had in a bag ho was carrying, in which he had placed the papers. He replied, "Newspapers," and said first that e had procured them at a place in Huigerford. street, and then that he had got them from The Times office. The constable locked him up, and went to Messrs. Miosley's and waited until West returned with the cart. When he came back he was asked in the presence of his employer if he had given any papers to a person in the Strand. He said he had not, and he was taken into custody; 27 copies of The Times were found in Skinner's bag. The learned counsel having addressed the jury for the prisoners, A verdict of (uilly was returned against both. Mr. CrE.sY sentenced West to three and Skinner to six months' hard labour. John Brown, who was convicted on Thursday for stealing a ca8hbox, containing 311. Jos., &c., from the Paul's Head publichoUse, Finsbur, was brought up and sentenced to four years' penal servitude. THE RICE CASE. Mr. SLEIGH said, the order issued by the Court on Friday evening for the attendance of the persons who detained the produce of the rice robberies had had the good effect of causing three of those persons to deliver up the property so detained by them, but a fourth still contumaciously refused to obey the order, and he (Mr. Sleigh) intended to advise his client to indict that person for a nmidemeanour in disobeying the order of the Court Mr. CEEASv said that wrould be the proper course to Shortly afterwards the Court was informed that al the rice would be Immediately delivered up. James Thaice, 44, and Wllliam Russell, 40, were indicted, Thake for stealmng, and Russell, who surrendered, for feloniouslyreceiv7ing, eight bottles of cider, the property of Joseph Child, the employer of Thake. Mr. Cent prosecuted;* Mr. £eigh and Mr. Cooper appeared for the prisoners. The evidence failed to makce out the charge, and the prisoners were Acquitted. William Rowe, 28, was indicted for stealing a purse containing a half-sovereign, from the person of Martha Fox. The jury found him Guilty, and several former convictions were proved against him. Mrr. CRESY passed a sentence of seven years' penal servltude.
POLICE. Boiv-sTRRET.-A young man of Hlndoo origin, who said his name was Maahamood Alli, but who is known to the police as John Frederic Brown, was charged with stealing a checkbook and obtaining goods from various tradesmen under false pretences, He had been in the babit of ordering considerable quantities of goods, saylng that he was " agent," or in some cases " aide-de-camp to the Queen of Oude. After givme instructions to senXd the goods to Harley-house be would observe that he wished to take a small quantity with him,a desire which was generally compled with; and, if not, he would mere.g observe that it was of no consequence, and go away. In some cases he scrawled upon eaper somethin which passed with the shopkeeper for Sindustanl, and which he said was an order on Her Majesty the Queen of Oude, which would be understood at Harley-house. In this way he obtained at Messrs. Jullien and Co.'s a handseme opera glass and six tickets for the entortainment for the benefit of Mrs. Seacole. In all cases the goods were refused and the paper declared useless at Harley-house. On the 6th instant he presented himself at Messrs. Grindley and and Co.'s Bank, in St. Martin's-lane,and represented that he had a sum of 3,7651,, which he wanted to transfer to them from LiverpooL For this purpose he made an order on Messrs. Hodgson and Baker of that town,-a firm existing only it appears, in imagination. He then made inouiries as how he should draw the mone when in Messrs. rindley's hands, and Mr. Boyle, the cleri who had attended to him, proceeded to explain the mode of drawing the check, and showed him a checkbook, which the prisoner contrived to abstract before leaving. He then called on Messrs. Silk, of Long-acre, coachmakers, and bonght a coach for 1601., whioh was to Include certain alterations to fit it for the climate of India. Here he drew a check for 501. as deposit, and another for 5l., which he asked Mr. Silk to cash. Mr. Silk sent It to the bank, but the prisoner deelined to await the messenger's return, and went away, saying he would return shortly, which he, of course, never did. His next visit was to Messrs. Moses and Son, In New Oxford. street, where he bought a complete suit of clothing, includ. ing under lnen, boots, hat, &c., all of which he put on, and then drew a check on Messes. Grindley for the amount. Here again he refused to await the return of the messenger, and, on being told that be could not leave with the clothes on him, he consented to take them off again. As he was dressing himself in his own clothes the messenger returned, accompanied by Mr. Royle, who gave him in charge for stealing the checkhook. Re gave the book up to Mr, he prisoner, whose smart appearance and graceful man. ners were well calculated to accredit his importance defended himself with great warmth and energy, and In remarkably good English, but without touching the material points of the case. He admitted that he knew nothing of the Royal Family of Oude, but said that he came from that country. Eo also admitted that there was no such bank as he had ammed at Liverpool, but asserted that he had taken the checkbook without Mr. Royle's knowledge aud consent, A former conviction was proved against him, and he was committed for trial.

SUMMR1B ASSIZES. TnM,R flTpr.fTTTrm CROYDON, AuGusT 14. (Before ae CHrT BAroN and Special Juries.) MIYXRS V. LAWSON AND CO. This was an action to recover damages for a malicious prosecution. Mr. E. James, Q.C., Mr. Hawkins, and Mfr. Allen were for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr. Poland for the defendants. Mr. JMErs said,he was happy to inform the jury that they wouald not be troubled by hearing anv evidence in this case. The defendants had indicted Mr. Myers, with two other persons named May and Taylor, for a conspiracy to defraud them of their goods at the Central Criminal Court, and he was acquitted, and they were now satisfied that there was no ground for the charge they had preferred, and were willing to apologize; and under these circumstances the plaintiff would be contented with a nominal verdict. Serjeant BAL -rLrE said, ha did not consider he was Justified in occupylng the attention of the jury further than oyshtain tht Messrs. Lawwon and Co. were highly respect. able gentlemen, and that at the time they preferred the eharge against Mr. Myers they were fully justified in taking that course. The other two defendants, May and Taylor, were convicted, and there was no doubt that Messrs. Lawson had been plundered of property to a very large amount. They were now, however, satisfied that there was no foundation for the charge that had been made against the plaintff, and they were wiUling to withdraw all imputations upon his character in connexion with this transaction. A verdict for the plaintiff, with 40s. damages, was then taken. LAMBERT v. SIDEBOrrO. This was what is called an interpleader action, the question in dispte being whether a bill of sale, executed by one James Adkins to the plaintiff, was a valid instrument, or whether it was executed fraudulently in order to defeat a Judgment that had been obtained by the defendant against Adkins. Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and MIr. Needbam were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. E. James, Q.C., Mr. SezjeantBa"lntine, and Mr. Hawkins were for the defendant. The present action arose out of the following eircumstances :-In June last the defendant, who is a gentleman of fortune, brought an action in the Court of Queen's Bench against Adsins, who was the keeper of a gambling. house at the west end of the town, called the Berekley Clubhouse, to recover a sum of 6,5001., which be alleged to have been won from him at hazard by means of false dice. Upon that occasion he clearly established that he had been plundered at the house in question, and Sir F. Kelly, who appeared for the defendant Adkins, consented to a verdict for the sum sought to be recovered. Judgment was subse. qently entered and execution was granted, but upon the seniff going to se ze the property of Adkins, who occupied a house at Brompton, called Wintersoll-house, and the fur. niture contained in it, the present plaintiff claimed a right to the whole of the property under a bill of sale; and the question now to be decided was whether this was a valid instrument or not. The lease end furniture of the honse were valued at 1,3001. Mr. BOVILL, having briefly addressed the jury, and stated that, according to his instructions, the plaintiff had really and bond fide purchased the property in question, called Mr. Lambert, the plalntiff, who stated that he was in the habit of betting upon the turf, and that he was acquainted with Adkins, and had betted with him, and was also acquainted with a gentleman named Padwick. He said that s ortly before June last he was recommended by Mr. Padwick to advance some money to Adkins upon the seeurity of the lease of his house and the furniture it contained, and a bill of sale was eventually executed, under which he paid 00t. for the lease and 8001. for the furniture contained in the house. The check that bad passed through the bankers' upon the occmion was produced, and the witness swore that the transaction was a perfectly regular one, and he took possesdon of the property under the bill of sale on the 22d of June. In cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that he had been on very intimate terms with Adkins, and that they had had a good many betting transactions together. He also said that he was present at the trial in Westminster. ball, before Lord Campbell, when the false dice were produced, and Adkins' counsel, Sir F. Kelly, consented to a verdict against him, and on the afternoon of the same day he sent a man named Edwards down to Brompton to take possession of the property under the bill of sale. At this time he was aware that Adkins had gone to Boulogne, and he believed he was still there. Mr. Padwick was then examined, and he deposed that an offer was made to him by Adkins to deposit the lease of his house and furniture as a security for the advance of a considerable sum of money, but he declined to have anything to do with the transaction. He did, however, mention the subject to the plaintiff, with whom he was intimate, and who he understood wished to invest some money. Cross-examined.-The proposition made to him was to advance the money upon Adkins's house and furniture, but he positively declined to have anything to do with such a transaction. Two or three other witnesses were examined on behalf of the plainti;f but they did not carry the case any further. Mr. JLEs, on behalf of the defendant, said he would not for a moment attempt to deny that a regular bill of sale had been executed, and that all the accompanying formalities, even to the obtaining of new notes from the bankers to between the parties, had been gone through; but what neshould ask the jury to say by their verdict was that the whole proceedings were a sham and a trick to cheat Mr. Sidebottom, and prevent him from receiving any benefit from the verdict he had obtained against Adkins ; and upon this ground he asked for theirverdict. The CErB= BAROx summed up, and having observed that it was entirely a question for the jury, they, after a very short deliberation, returned a verdict for the defendant, GWORGE V. TA?-N-IN'O. This was a common jury cause. The action was brought against the defendant for having seduced and debauched the wife of the platitiff. The defendant pleaded " Not Guilty, and leave and license." Mr. Pearce was counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Parry and Mr. Petersdorff were for the defendant. It appeared from the opening statement of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that he was the son of a special leader and connected with the legal profession, and the defendant had formerly carried oa the business of a tailor in New Bond-street. The plaintiff, it appeared, was married at Brighton in 1851, and in 1853 his wifo left him, and went to reside with the defendant at different places in London, and passed as Mrs. Manning, and two children were born during their intercourse. In 1856 the wife of the Iplaintiff had a miscarriage, and was very ill, and died in the month of August of that year. Ono or two witnesses were examined, but their evidence was of very little importance, and one of them proved that in 1854 the plaintiff went to a cigar shop that was kept by his wife in the New-road, and where the defendant had lived with her, and took possession of the property that was there. A witness named Gosling, who was supposed to have beon able to prove something material, was then called, but as she did not answer the form was gone through of calling her upon her subpcena. Mr. PEs.cE then said, it would be useless for him to proceed further with the case, and he must consent to a The CnlEF BARON said,he must observe that, so far as the evidence had gone, there was a good deal to support the defendant's plea of leave and license, and he thought the learned counsel had exercised a sound discretion in withdrawing from the case. Mr. Serjeant PARRY said that, if it had been necessary, he should have been able to show distinctly that the laintiff was perfectly well aware of what was going on. He also thought it right to say that there was no ground for the statement that the plaintiff was in any way connected with the law; and the fact was that he had been a waiter at an hoteL The plaintiff was then nonsuited. AuGosT 15. (Before the Cmrx BARON and a Special Jury.) BARNETT AND ANOTHER V. REEDE. The plaintiffs in this action, Messrs. Barnett and Johnstone, are well known, the former as a dramatic author, and the latter as an actor aid dramatic cornposer at the Strand Theatre, and the defendant is also well known as a dramatic author. The action was brought to recover damages from the defendant for having inserted a notice in the Era newspaper in which he alleged that a piece about to be produced at the Strand Theatre was a piratical imitation of a work he had himself written * and the plaintiffs represented that in consequence of this notice they were prevented from taking advantage of the new Copyright Act by selling the privilege of representing their drama to the mnanagers of country theatres. hIr. M Chambers, Q.C. , and MIr. W'ordsworth, Q.C., appeared for the plaintiffs; Mr. E. James, Q. C., Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Prentice were counsel for the defendant. Mr. Ciutaruns, in opening the case to the jury, described itas one of considerable importance to dramatic authors, and he then proceeded to state the circamstances under which the action was brought. It appeared that in the beginning of the year a piece called Les Paus'rcs de Paris was produced in Paris, which excited considerable sensation, and the defendant, who is the agent for foreign authors, made a translation of this work, and registered it in accordance with the provisions of the International Copyright Act as his property. The plaintiffs subsequently, it appeared, jointly produced another version of the same piece under the title of The Psride of Povrty, or the Scat Poor of London, and it was offered to Mr. Payne, the manager of the Strand Theatre, by whom it was accepted and tho piece was announced for performance the first time on Uonday, the 16th of February. The title of the defendant's piece, It appeared, was Poverty and Pride, and although it was admitted by the plaintiffs that both the dramas were derived from the original French piece, they contended that theirs was totally different from the defendant's, and that they only took a geEeral Idea uf the character of the piece called Les Pauvres de Pai-is, and that theirs was entitled to be considered as an original production. The piece of the plaintiffs having beon announced for performance on the 16th of February, it appeared that a notice was inserted in the Era newspaper of tho previous week, which was to the effectthat the piece was a piratical imitation of the defendant's work, and cautioning every one concerned to abstain from representing It tder the penalty of disobeying an injunction from the Court of Chancery. This notice purported to be signed by Mr. Annesley, the attorney for the defendant, but in a letter that was subsequently written by Mr. Reede he stated that MIr. Amnesley did not sign the notice in question, but that In his hurry he had himself written his solicitor's name. The learned conusel said that the piece was played upon the day fixed, but in consequence of all the actors being under the dread of a visit from the Lord Chancellor's tipetaffand mace they did not perform their parts with the spirit they otherie would have done, and this, no doubt, interfered a good deal with the success of the piece. The plaintiffb were also nasble to avail themselves of the p-ovi. sions of the Co right Act, under which the were entitled to receive a cert.-damount for every night tat a succesnful piece was played at a cou ntry theatre, the country manaers being of course afraid to represent the Piece inc qesfon ,lter the notico, lest they shouid bring themselves in oon- tact with the Court of Chancery. He then stated that the action was brought to recover damages that had been r;tained by the plaintiffs in the matters above mentioned, and there was also a count in the declaration charging the defendant with slander, and he said he should submit that the notice in question, denying the right of the plaintiffs to the piece that was to be prodaced, amonnted in law to what was caled a alander of title, for which the plaintiffs were also entitled to damres. The CI REF KRox here observed that to support the allegation of a slander of title the act niut be done maliciously, and he should certainly rule that if the person who gave such a notice as the one now referred to did so tond .lle, and under the belief that the work was a piratical imitation of his own, he would not be liable under the count for slander of title. Mr. CArngERs said he should contend that the fact of the defendant having placed his attorney's narae to the notice and making a false representation in reference to the proceedings in Chancery were evidence of malice. The CssEF BA.soN observed that it appeared to him that everything turned upon the fact whether the plaiintiffs' was an orif'mal pw, or whether it was a mere translation from the irench Mr. JAmES said they had them both in court, and the I defendant's work also and they could all be read in French and English. (A laugh.) There wereonlysevenactstothe French play. (Renewed laughter.) The CHIEF BA.RO.N repeated that there could be no slander of title if a man acted bond tCde in the belief that his property had been pirated. Suppose a person hada patent for washing or manglpng- Mr. }. JAtEz.-My Lord, your observation applies to this play exactly. tLaughter.) The CIEF BARON said he was going to state that if any one had a patent of this or any other description he was quite jifstled in giving notice to any one who he considered was infringing his rights. Mr. J. V. Johnstone was then called as a witness. He deposed that he was one of the plaintiffs in the present action, and by profession an actor and a dramatic author, and during the last few years he had written a great many dramatic pleces. He heard of the piece being played in Paris called Les Pauvres de Pars at the beginning of the present year, and he and Mr. Barnett subsequently wrote the drama that was played at the Strand theatre. The French work probably was read to him. The name given to their dramna was The Pride of Povermq ,or, ahe ReaZ Poor of Xondon. (A cop7of it was here produced and identified by the witness.) witness was the author of the drama now produced jointly with Mr. Barnett. He had never read the French original and did not understand French, but Mr. Barnett gave him a general idea of the nature of the French piece. He was not guided by this entirely, but t principaily from his own original idea in the portion of the piece that he wrote. When It was finished the piece was offered to Mr. Payne, of the Strand Theatre, and he accepted It, and it was advertisod for performance on Monday, the 16th of February. It was rehearsed previously, and every means were taken to get the piece up properly. It was performed on tho night of the 16th, but there was a great deal of interruption and the curtain fell fivo or six times during the performance. This arose from various causes. He could not say whether Mr. Reede was in the house. On the previous Saturday he had seen the notice referred to in. the Jra newspaper, and also the advertisement relating to Les Pautsres de Paris. He believed that every one of the actors had heard of or read the notiee. The CmEFx BARoN said they really could not go into this matter. They had nothing to do with what the actors had heard or read. The witness then furtherstated that In consequenee of the notice he was prevented from selling the right of repre. senting the piece in question to a country manager, which was a consderable sourco of profit to the author of a successful piece. Cross-examined by Mr. JAM1Ss-I am an actor. I do what is called the heavy father business. (A laugh.) I played Mr. Ralph Vernon in my own piece. There was a very good house on the first performanoo. I do not know that Mr. Laurence Levi had anything to do with the theatre. I only know Mr. Payne as the manager. The piece was played for about three weeks at the Strand heatre. It afterwards was played at the Victoria. The manaFer of that theatre gave us 2. for permission to represent it. (A laugh.) This was after it had been played 12 nights. The pleoe was not damned after it had been played about the same number of nights at the Victoria. It was as successful as such pieces generaUy are. The piece was never printed, and he did not register it under the Copyright Act. It took him about two days to write it. Mr. Jsxxs here said it appeared to him that this evidence put an end to the plaintiffs' case, for by the 8th section of that Act it was specially declared that an author or other person should not be entitled to any benefit from its provisions unless certair conditions, one of which was that the work should be duly registered, were complied with. The cross-examination of the witness, however, was continued. He said,-I do not consider my piece a translation from the French. I had a general idea, and acted upon that, and I consider the piece played at the Strand Theatre to be an original piece. I believe a translation of the French piece was read to me by Mr. Payne, but I swear I never saw the defendant's work before I wrote my own. The incidents and characters in our piece are different from those in the French. There was a suffocating by charcoal scene, a pistol scene, and a supper scene, and a double scene on the stage in the French piece, and so there are in ours, but the incidents are differently managed. Mr. JAmES-The first act ends, I believe, by one of the characters, Ravenstone, being handcuffed by the police as the drop falls, and then there is a tableau. That, of course, is not in the French original ? Witness.-Certalnly not. (A laugh.) Mr. JXXS.-And at the conclusion of your piece Martha, another of the characters, addresses the audience and says, "May we, with your permission, say all right, and reckon on Maryepeat to-morrow night." (Much laughter.) That is, of course, also originaL" Witness.-That was not in the French piece. He went on to say that the title of Mr. Reede's piece was Poverty and Pride, and Mr. Payne gave their piece the title of nhe Pride of Povcrty ; or, the Real Poor of London. Cross-examination.-Poisoning by charcoal was a very common incident of a play not only in France but at the Strand Theatre. (A laugh.; Mr. JA"rEs.-I believe another "incident" in your play is where Ravenstone stuffs a tablecloth into a hole in the partitioa to keep the draught out, and at the same timo says there Is enough wind to blow a man's teeth down his throat. (Laughter.) That, I suppose, is another original feature, and was not in the French piece. Witness.-It is not in the French piece. In answer to further questions put by Mr. JAmES, the witness said that one or two of the incidents in his play were similar to those in the French, but he considered the general character of the piece was so altered that it might fairly be considered an original production. Mr. JAstxs.-I see that while the charcoal ofricer is going on on one side, Ravenstone, who Is on the other, the stage being divided and forming_ two scenes, seems to be more sensible, for he says he shall have his supper and proceeds to eat four ounces of boiled beef. (A laugh.) Mr. CHi,ABRRs.-Tbere is no "boulli " introduced in the orBiinal piece. (A laugh.) The witness then said that there was a fraudulent banker in his piece, and so there was in the French. Ar.JmsEs.-The only difference being that in your piece he is a " British Bank"-er. (Laughter.) Witness.-Exactly so. (Renewed laughter.) Mr. B. Barnett deposed that he was the joint author of the piece in Vuestion, with Mr. Johnstone. He understood the French language perfectly, and his attention was at. tracted to the French piece Les Paurres de Par-is, and he got a copy of it and read It carefully through, and afterwardsread a rough transLation of it to Mr. Payno, and ho said that it was too long, and suggested that witness and Mr. Johnstone should write a shorter drama; and upon this the ywrote the one in questIon. They only adopted the maXI incidents of the French piece, and introduced alto. gether new characters. The comic character of their piece was a man who sold books in a barrow. (A laugh.) In the French piece a sgnpainter was the comic personage. He said the idea was taken from the French piece, but he considered that their own piece, notwithstanding, was quito The CuIrE BARON, at the conclusion of Mr. Barnett's evidence, said he really thought it was quite useless to go into any more evidence. The only question was whether the plaintiffs' piece was a plratical imitation of the other, and this could much more easily be ascertained by reading over the original French piece and the two others. Mr. JAMES said, he should submit that the plaintiff< had made out no case at all, and that, as they had not complied with the provisions of the Copyright Act, they had no property whatever in the piece In question, and had no ground of action. The question was one of considerable imnportance, undoubtedly, both to English and to foreign authors, and the defendant, as the authorized agent of the latter, and who in that capacity had duly registered his work, was very anxious that the polnt should be settled. The CIIIEF BARON said he was certainly of opinion that if the plaintiffs had not registered their work they had no legal property in it, and had no ground for sustaining the present action. Mr. CHuAmBERs said that this was a question of law which he should wsh to have settled. The learned counsel on both sides then conferred together, and the result wasthat an arrangement was come to that the plaintiffs should be nonsuited, but with the understanding that all the facts and the question of law should undergo further consideration, and if the result should be in favour of the plaintiffs the nonsuitwas to be set aside,and theCourt would be empowered to assess the damage sustained by them.
NORTBF.RN CTRtflTTIP LIVERPOOL, Aro. 14. TnE CRowS CouRT.-(BCforC Mr. Baron WATSOx.) James Davies was indicted for the wilful murder of Robert Reuses at Liverpool on the 25th of May last. Mr. Blair appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Aspinall for the defence of the prisoner. It appeared from the statement of the learned counsel for the prosecution and from the evidence adduced that the prisoner Is a tailor by trade, and resided at No. 3 Court in Bostock-street, Liverpool. On the night of the 25th of Maylast the prisoner entered a publichouse in Scotland. ro=a, drunk and in an excited state, and asked a man named Robert Hodson to go down with him to his house, as there was a man in bed with his wfie, and he would show himn (Hodson) some fun. Hodson went with him, and on arriving at the prisoner's house his wife was found sitting on a chair In the lower room. The deceased tben struck and abused his -wife, and asked Hodson to go upstair3 with him. He followed the prisoner into a room upstairs, in which there was a bed. No one was in the room, and the prisoner looked under the bed and said he was in the house somewhere. The bedclothes were tumbled. They thenwent into the garret and found the deceased there, lying on a bed on the floor, apparently asleep, with his clothes on. The prisoner said, " The - is here," and ran and jumped on the deceased's face. Tho deceased turned and fell on the floor. The prisoner then took from his pocket a pair of scissors and shoved them into the side of the deoeased, who made no resistanee and did not speak. Hodson asked the prisoner if he meant to kill the man, and the prisoner cried out, "Stand back or I Will senrve you the same." The prisoner then went down stair, and Hodson went for Vr, Horrocks, with whom he returned immeditdely. Tih deceasedws then dying and unable to speak, and diedTIn ten minutes. On examining him twox woundu were found In the upper pmrt of his left breasta and also so7me contused wounds on his, face. On a pose imortem examiatiOn the aorta was found to Be phrfora- th two Place, and the deceased had died from loss of blood. There were other two wounde which penetrated the ch st. The examination of the body of the eceased also shwed that he had had recent connezion with a 'woman. lis LoRDsnip, In surmming uap the evidence, caled the attention of the jury to the law as laidl down by the text writers that alngan killing another caahtw in the act of adultery with his wife was not muirder. t manslaughter In the lowest degree, and it was for them to say whether the circumstances of this case warranted such a finding. The jury found the prisoner Guilty of nanslaughter of the lowest degree. His LowDn shentenced the prisoner to four dayDt imprisonment. Hannah Smnith, single woman, 44 years of age, was in-. dicted for the murder of her infant child. Mr. Suirtees appeared for the prosecution ; Mr. Tindal Atkirnson for the prisoner. It appeaed from the witnesses called on the part of the Crown that the prisoner worked in a factory, and that the deceased at the time of its death was nine months old. At 5 o'clock in the morning of the 29th of May the prisoner came to the house of a woman who usualy had the care of the child, her hair dishevelled, and the whole of the upper part of her body dripping with wet, and said, " Hannah, I have attempted three times to go with my child, but I couldnot; I have been in the water three times, but the Lord has pulled me beck. I went into tho water with the child at my bosom." The woman to whom this was told screAmed, and the noise brought up persons who went to the =risonr's house and found her sitting on a chair, and the aeceased ina mug of water, Its legs hanging out and the face downwards. The surgical evidence proved that there were no marks of violence, no lividity or sweling, the pupils of the eye were slightly dilated, and the brain somewhat congested. that there was no frothy mucas or water in the widnApe, and on cross-examination it was elicited that the appearances were consistent with suffocation from other causes besides that produced by drowning. Mr. T. AT=NSON addressed the jury, contending that the death might have been caused by the prisoner embracing her child and causing suffocation before she attempted to destroy herself; but that even if that were not so she was not in that state of mind which made her responsible for her actions. He would show that in order to pay off some debts she had been living almost on bread and water, and from that and from trouble she had fallen into a state of deep, hopeless despondenoy as eirly as March * that her conduct was that of an irrational and irreeponsible agent, and that she was therefore not guilty on that grouna. Several witnesses were caled vrho proved that the prsoner's conduct had undergone a mnarked change in March; that she had said the doctor had told her to beat the reelens; that she attempted to do so, but fell from exhaustion and weakness produced from low living ; that she was constantly crying and saying she would destroy herself; that she became incoherent, wild, and melancholy. lcoking. The learned JUmGg, in summing up, took occasion to remark on the widespread habit among policemen of asking questions of those whom they took into custody, and afterwards giving their answers in evidenoe against them at their trial. He said It was aginst the whole policy of our law, magistrates even being required to caution a prisoner against makig, any statement; t It wvras so easy to add or subtract a word, and so materially vary the nature of an answer, that such evidence should be regarded with great sspicion. The jury AcquiUed the pri3oner on the ground of inuanity, and she was ordered to be detained durimg Her Maiesty's pleasare. AUGUST 15. CIVIL COURT.- (Before Mr. Baron0 CHAEINZLL,) WOOD V. GARSrDE. This was an action for breach of promise of marriage. The defendant pleaded that he did not promise. Mr. honck, Q.C,, and Mr. Ovens appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Hl, Q.C., and Mr. Spinks for the defendant, It appeared from the opening statement of the learned counse for the plaintiff that the plaintiff was a farmer's daughter of Oidl dame, in Saddleworth, near Oldham, and that the defendant is a master dyer of SaddleworthThe plaintiff is a person in a humble station of life, about 21 years of age, and at the time the defendant became acquainted with her she was a person of rare personal beauty. Her father was some time ago a farmer, having some land and keeping cattle; but be became reduced in circumstances, and his children were under the necessity of goilg out to earn their own living. At an early age the ulaintiff was under the necessity of going to the place of business of the defendant, who is in a superior station of life, for the purpose of taking dinners to her brothers and sisters, who worked at the manufactory at Saddlewortb. The defendant carried on a business of considerable extent there. He was of considerably greater age than the plain. tiff, and when the acquaintance first commenced she was about 17, and he was upwards of 30. He manifested great anxiety to win the affections of the plain. tig, and she received his advances with much coyness. Both to her mother, her father, and other relations he had over and over again avowed his deep attachment. He was told there was a disproportion in their yeazs and a disproportion in their fortunes-that the marriage would notbeasuitable one on his part, and thathehadbetter abstain. He stated that he had fixed his affecti9ns firmly and strongly upon her, and that he could not live without her. On one occasion he spoke of building a house for her in any style she chose, and for a long period of time he was most assiduous in his attentions, and even resorted to in- enious expedients for tho purpose of obtaining access to er. Heat length succeede in bis attentions and removed ber reluctance and no doubt her affections were given to him, for shortly after she gave birth to a child. In the condition of misery and disgrace to which she was reduced her father went to the defendant and told him his daughter was fretting herself very much, and the defendant said, ' I don't mean to do anything; I have had allI wanted." The father told him he was a scoundrel, and then left him. These were the whole facts of the case. These facts havinf been proved by the plaintiff's mother, a witness named Solomon Coates proved that he was the cousin of the plaintiff, and had known Garside for more than 20 years. He is a woollen printer. I have had many transactions with him. I have a sister named Shaw, who lives near the place whero the defendant resides. I recoUect one day Ars. Shaw, her husband, the plaintiff, and her sister Mary, coming to my house. It was on a Sunday, and they h dinner at my house. After dinner we went out to wallk, and met with Garside near our house. This was the third Sunday In August, 1853. Defendant walked along with me, and he said he had fallen in love with MissWoodwhenshousedto visit Shaws house. Hesaid she was very shy, and wanted me to speak to her; but I said I thought it was not an equal match. He said it was no matter, hewould have her;he had money enough,andhewouldmake over 1001. a-year to her, and build her a house wherever she thought proper. At tea, after the walk, the defendant paid great attention to Miss Wood, but she was very shy. I remember their leaving to go home ; they all went in the same conveyance. Before going he pressed me to persuade her to listen to him. In July, 1855, 1 saw him, The plaintiff and her sister were with him. He told me he was very glad she was so altered, and they were going to be married. ie asked me if I could give him any information how to get married. (Laughter.) He didn't want it published. I asked his reason; he said that as his father was old it might make 7,001. or 8,0001. difference to him. He talked about going to Gretna-green to be married (laughter); but I said I didn't.understand anything about that. Mr. White the sexton of our church, just then came up, and I said, " This gentleman wants to speak to you." I then left them. A short time afterthis Mr.Whitebrought me aletter, and toldme to give it to Garside, which I did. He read it, and ,Aid, " It wil be just the thing." He aslked me if I could allow my wife to reside with the plaintiff in the Isle of Man for 30 days; it needed that tine before they eculd get married. I consented, but afterwards he complained that work had come in to prevent his going. He said they would be married, however, before Christmas. He wanted me to see an attorney who would bind them to be married before Cbristmas. I went to Mr. Stranding, but he laughed at me. I subseq;Iently got adocument from Mlr. Stranding, and gave it to John White said-I live at Rochdale, and am seston of the parish church. I recollect a Sunday in Agust, 1SSS, and remember being consulted by Mr. Garside respecting a marriage license. I asked if they both resided in the parish, and he said they did, and that they were both of age. He said he wished to be married to Hannah Wood. I told him how to get a license. He inquired if he could be married at GretnaLgreen, or at the Isle of Man, as he didn't want his folks to know of it, as they were very rich. He seemed very serious in the matter, as they generally are in those matters. (Laughter.) Cross-examined by Mr. HILL.-What occupation were you ? Witness.-I vas sexton. Mr. HiLL.-Well, but a sexton is to help people to get into the grave, not to help to get them married. Witness.-Butdwe have to get a population before we ca bury themp Lodlaste. Sarah Winterbottoma said .che v,was the sister of the plaintiff, and the wife of James Winterbottom, of Higginshar. She proved a promise of marriage by the defendant to the plaintiff, and when witness said they vrere very different In age, he said, " Oh, but money will make that all right and I'll make over 1001. a year to her." He refused to ieave the house, and said he must eitber marry her or no one olso would. He said his heart beat for ber both night and day, and if she would not marry him be would drown himsgelf. Crose-examined by Mr. HILt-Her husband kept the Hare and Hounds. It was a sporting-house. The plaintiff never went to the racing-grornd, but served drink in the house. Giles Wood, the father of the plaintiff, said.-In 1S56 I observed my daughter was fretting, and I went to Mr. Garside. I told him he never came to see my daughter since her misfortune, for she had miscarried. He said, *' No ; I think I have done with her. rU have nothing more to do with either her or you." I said, "You ae a bonnyman-yo are a d- onamp.- Mr. HILL, on behalf of the defendant, addressed the jury at considerable length. He asked where two parties came into court under sueb circumstances as the plaintiff and the defendant, giving the plaintiff all the advantage of youth and beauty, and the manner in which she had been wronVed -what chance had any one of dealing dispassionately with the case! The feelings of the jury must of necessity exerise an tIfluence on the judgment; but he appealed to them calmy to consider all the circunstances of the case. He commented on the singular fact that no evidence had been produced to show how the plaintiff had passed her time, or with whom she had oonsorted between July or August, 155, and the time of the misrriae in 1856; and he earnestly ealled pon the jur to exercise the utmost aomount of caution In coming to their deoision.

T'he Portoohaving always meant to act wvith straight1orwardness hie thlis question, and, believing that the 'lectoral lists had been drawn uip with the sp:rit of fairness it had always enjoinecd to its agcnts in the Principalitiea, considered a delay of eight days 1i:fficiesnt to correct any omissions or eirors which amight have jassed tunnoticed hi drawing up electoral lists for the iirst time in a country where elections -were a niovelty, but a longer delay scemed dangerouis In presence of the powerful organization of the Vniouist party ; in refusing it the Miniiters Df the iPorte never thought that tlhey would be accused of want of respect andl deferenec to the wishes of an august ally, the Emperor of the Frencli.

The de niand to annul the elections would still have been made, and, supported hy the Powers whio advocate the Uaion, vould have bcen brouglht; under the consideration of the Porte, and the result 'would probably have been the same. No eiort.-s have been spared on the part of the Sultan and his 3Winisters to bring about an arrangement satisfactory to all parties, and avoid the rupture which has unfortunately taken place. It might, indeed, be coniended that, with a view to conciliate, he has ceded more than his dignity should have allowed. To a note from the French Ambassador, complainingr that the Ministry did not treat the deiands of the Freocel Governmielt with proper deference, the sultau replicd by dismissing tho Grand Vizier R3edschid Pasia. The inew Ministry, with the vencrable Mustapha Pasha of Crete at their head, immediately proceeded to exaiLno a second tinme thele demands of the French Ambassador. It appeared, from the adinisdion of Vogorides himself, that the C(overiinent ag,ents had interfered in the elections. and Vogoridles declared that he authorized this in terference in coiisequiienzce of orders from RPedschid Pasha hiniself, who, he says, madle him play an ilTamous part, and now disavows hirn. In the Coull. cil of Ministers Redschid Pasha energetically protscted againuit such an accusation, aud soloinsly declard 1 that ho hiad never directly or indirectly transwitted to Vogoeides any orders that were not in strict confol,nity with the Imperial firnian. Ti-n circumstances, although they did not authorize so arlitrary an act as the inmmediate annulmnent of th elections, ren(lered an inquiry imperative, and th. Ciunl:cil of MIinisters, in the night of the 3d of August, decided that the Kanimakans should be summioned to Constantinople, and an iniquiry be instituted intotheirconduct-the aiunluileiit or con:firrmatien of the elections to be subject to the result of this inquiiiry. This decision was communicated to thelFrench Amlbassador on theL molning of the 4th In a note couched in most coinciliatory terni4, of vlhich 1 enclose a translation from the F1rench:- A .A1.1 Pr%.l]A, MirN1l4TERl F-OR FRlt4lll:; tF Arr.is )12 E\ClEIL.ENC TIE ht.EL;e An.,SAsI otsI..

" The desire of the loperial Governinent in this mattar was, while eLndcavouritn to ensure a cont;iuation of the fri,itely dimpositios of tlio allied Powets, to execute loyally the ditics iniposeil upon it by the Treaty of Paris, and while d ilY c-l id sri: -all o,l.iervatii,sns roade to i, on the subiect of thc electione, ftiftfilfly to observe all its ;rescription%.

But, alas It has not 1, en able to obtulim this unnLnmity, and the xnathtr is still in ilispilPe. The Siblisnc Porte is dispensed fromn aiterir.g a rule formLed by all parties without obtainiua the C'-nsenit of all parties. Dit at the F-mie tirno the S'mh nil1e Porte opcnly declares at once that she still havo no hesitation In perforuimuig the dut-y re -imired of lier by jisti ice, when the irregularities alleged to have occurred in the execution of ore lers inued by is li-is-ria !

"Phe Ilorte, therefore, tstee,m, ie a daty requirad by ja-tioe to declare e lonce that it wil hold itself at liberty to annul it in ti' at case. i "In the :rnm hopo that a decision in accordance with the princip)l' of fairness and, the spirit of business, and with the respect and consideration due by the Sublime Porte t. thM French Goverament will be agreed to by your Exuellency and appreciated by tie Eimperor's Government, I ba,sten to commuwlicate It to you by order of 11's Majesty." To this niote of the Porte-in which the principle of annulling the elections, should it prove on inquiry that they have been fallacious, is clearly admitted by the Porte-the French Atnbnssador replies by reiterating his demand that they be annu'led at once, and intimatfes his intention of suspending diplomatic relations unless he receives a favourable auswer before 8 o'clock next morning. The Council of Ministers assembles once more: they are deeply impressed with the gravity of the circumstances, but, after deliberating af' night, they are unable to alter their previous decision, and they express with great dignity their opinion in this seconad note:- TszE MLSDiTER FOR FoREICx ' F,ARS TO HIS FXCEL. LENCY hIJE FRENCI AMBASS.&Doe. I'ACOUST 5. " Your Excellency's note, sent to me Sin reply to mv communication to your Excellency, by order of His MaIjesty, concerning the decision of the Counc:' of Ministers in the question of the Piincipalities, received Yith great ! concern and sosrow, was immediatelylaid before the Council of Ministers, and submitted to His Majesty. |" As the Sablime Porte cannot iu any way allow its reilations of sincere friendship with the French Government ito suffer the least disturbance, it must be evident to your Excellency that the adoption byyour Excelleney of measures such as those you announce as about to be taken by your I Excellency, if your Excellency's demand is not granted in toto, wiU aflict 6nd distress the Porte to au extreme deg. ce. " I'he proposition of the Sablime Porte concerning the I clections of Moldavia and the demand put forward by I your Excellency and by your Excellency's three colleagues are in reality alike in principl'. If the annulment of the elections is made to depsud on a formal vexification of the irregularities alleged to have been committed, this is rendered necessaiy by tha desire of the Porte to act fairly and justly both towards itself and towards al the other parties to the treaty. It could never, therefore, have occurred to the Portethata decision in harmony with the rule of jastice could be construed into a. refusal of your ExceUency's demnand, and it was intimately consinced that such a mneaning would not be given to it by your Excellency, and it still entertains this hope. " The result of the deliberations of the Council of Mtinisters is therefore that the Sublime Porte cannot see any reason for the measures the adoption of which is announced in your Excellency's note, and sincerely requests the exertion of your efforts for the non-interruption in any way whatever of the sincere and friendly relations existing between the t o Governments, the continuance and permanence of which arc so anxiously wished for by my august master. | "At the same time, although there is no doubt that you will not be remiss in making known to your august master tho Emperor, the sincere and friendly dispositions of the Sultan's Govornment towarda that of France, as well as the considerations put forward by the Porte in this matter, yet Ilis Majesty, in order to give further proof of his regard, and in order to make known by a direct channel the reasons and real source of his opinion, has desired that a special letter be sent to the Emperor bimself. " i am ordered by H5; Majesty to infoin you that he entertaijis no doubt that you will again weigh these friendly communications in the balance of your judgnient, and that ! von will give stil further proofs of the well-disposed zeal iither`o displayed by your Excelloncy for the maintenanoe of the alliance of the two Governments. A short time after the recoption of this note, which does not seem animated by azy very hostile spirit, the French AAmbassador struck his flag in the way described in my yesterday's letter, and his three colleagues, to wvhom the note was also commllnicated, soon followed his example. Such is the history of the rather startling event which has just taken place in Constantinople. It is not possible to foretell what the consequences will be. But it may be remarked that if all parties had shown from the conmoncement the conciliatory and moderate spirit of the Porte, it is probable that tlhe extremae measures resorted to would not have been thoughc necessary. The difficulty has arisen here: its solution will probably take place nearer hosme. AUSTRIA. (FRoM 0UR OWN CORRESPON-DzNcy.) VIENNA, AuC;UST 14. Reliable information has reached me that certain foreign capitalists are aboiet to establish a new lDanubian Steam Navigation Company. The subjoined information relative to the already existing Danubian Steam Company will prove interesting :-I. The Austrian Danubian Steam Company has above 100 steamers and a large flotilla of steamtugs and barges for the conveyance of heavy goods and corn. 2. It has purchased the best coal mine3 in the neighbourl,uod of the river. 3. It has the most experienced captains, pilots, and sailors in its service. 4. It has the best landing-places at the principal towns between Passan and Galatz. 5. .t lias large establishments for the construction and repair ou its vessels at Chor-Neuburg, Pesth, Pansova, and Teirn-Severin. 0. It has just constructed a magnificent winter dock (117istcr-Hafen) f r its boats at Pesth. 7. It has an enormouscapital. 8. The State has guaranteed eight percent., including about one-half per cent. towards the sinking fund, on the capital. To the foregoingof it may be added that naither Austria nor Bavaria is likely to grant to foreign countries tho right of " cabotage" (coasting trade). The Austriarn Company has already lowered its charges for the conveyance of goods, and it would naturaUy reducc its present exorbitant prices for travellers if there shou'd be any competitioII on the river. It is said that M. Masjon, who -vaa formerly in the service of the Austrian Company, is to be the manager of the newestablishment. I Yesterday there was a slight imnprovement in Northern I'ailroad stock-, as it was reported on 'C han!e that the direction of the company " had declined to accept the concession for the 'West Galician Railroad." If the directors had any choice in the matter they would, doubtless, refuse to have anything to do with the railroad in iquestion, but ithe die is cast, acid the line from Oswicin to Cracow niov- belongs to tho Northern Railroad Company. Before the Emuperor quitted Vienna for Hungary he definitively settled the matter, by %sriting on the petition of the Northern Railroad Coompany to be permitted to cede the line in question to the East Galician Company, that he did not f3el himself " moved" (bcwcegen) to grant its requlest. The East Galician Railroad will now 'eegin at Cracow instead of Przemysl. A trial of the railway between Coccaalio and Palazzolo, in Lombardy, was made a few days since, and everythIng would have gone off well if some villain or villians had not laid a heavy iron bar across the rails. The re,urn train ran at full speed against the bar, and as a matter of course was thrown off the rails. 'i'wo of the men employed on the railway were killed on the spot, and several others severely wounded. It is expected that the whole line between Vrenice and Milan will be completed by the end of next month. As it has been settled that the elections in Mol. davia are to be repeatod, the Ot. Deiutschte Post considers it ad-visable to let the public know that some of the diplomsatists in Constantiuople went beyond their instructions. " It is not improbable," says .he non-olficial organ of the Austrian Foreign-office, "that Lord Redeliffe and Daron Prokesch furwarded tllh note of the 18th to the Porte on their own responsibility." The Presse has received a lettsr from the Polish frontiers, in whichl it is said that ihe Greek houses abroad are, as a rule, the agents of the Russian Government. Frequently, says the P olish writer, one and the same Greek family I as establishments in Odessa, Constantinople, ariselles, X'arls, and London, and, 1aturally, Fnrms so intimately connected keep each other well informed of everything that is going on. The Greeks and Armenians adopt the same system in :he East, and merchants connected by the ties of blood and acting according to one and the same plan are to be found in most of the great cities. -That the Russian Government takes advantage of the influence acquiired by these houses in order to further its comi mercial plans is a fact which has long been noto-. rious in Russia. A Polish correspondent of the Frankfvrt Jourial says it Is strongly sus ,ctedin the kingdom of Poland that some of the officers and soldiers who have recently beerv dis issed from thue Russian army with a year's pay have gone to join the mutineers in India, " Certain it is that the Russian Government 3's for the last three years been systematically e%citing the Chinese, Peraians, and the heirs of the G)reat Mogul against England." Naturally no guarantee can be given for the correctness of the foregoing assertion, but certain it is that a very strong impression prevails in this country the.t Russian agents are even now busy in the pro. vinces to the north and north-east of Delhi. The Emperor will return to Vienna late to-morrow evenfng, and not continue his Hungarian tour until the 23d inst. To-day His Majesty is in Stuhlweissenburg, the capital of the Comitat of the same name. Lady Clarendon arrived here yesterday evening. On the 1Ith, Lieutenant-Colonel Von Schindlocker, who was sent to Persia to purchase horses for the Imperial stlds, returned to Trieste. The Constantinople mail of the 8th inst. contains but little news. When the French Ambassador broke off his diplomatic relations with the Porte he placed the subjects rf France lnder the protection of the Spanish Embassy. M. de Thouvenel had a farewell audienee of the Sultan, who treated hin with extreme kindness, and assured him of his personal respect. Genieral Durando is indisposed. IT# TJY. (FROMt OlU; OwV2 oo0RSPONDFNh-r.) TURIN, AuG. 14. From evely parb of Itely the cryisstill "No news." The Pope continues to hold his Court at Dologna, considerably to the annoyance of the Bolognese, who foresee increased rates in every day the Pontifical visit is prolonged, without the re motest hope of any corresponding advantage frora it. A letter received from there this morning says the walls of the town have lately been placarded with the following address:- "1 Bolognese,-The journey of the Pope in his States wilU figure in the annals of Italy as a new disaster for these desolate provinces. This journey bad not for object either to sea and study more closely the evils and the wants of the peeple,or tohearandcomfort the just demands which time brimgs forth or to sow theseedsof aso'dand honest administration. Ith%s been nothing but a vain party of pleasure-an immoderate thirst of ovations-an insatiable desire to consecrate the triumph of reaction. The Pope has rejected the example of those Sovereigns who, cleverly profiting by dmilar points of contact wivtl their people, have endeavoured to strike out a way of conciliation betweeD the subjects and the Govern. ment-a commencement of transition from the past to the future. He, on the contrary, deaf to the wants of his people, wanting in all prudent policy, attentive only to the voice of the factious caste that surrounds him, came to amuse himself by walking on the almost smoking ruins of his people, who, with the instinct of acute suffering, placed their faith in him. But the illusion has now passed from every one. Ali hearts to-day weep, shudder, and curne. Neverthele.-s, Bolognese, don't iniag-ne that it would be an act of civil courage worthy of us to disturb our apparent tranqu311ity by uttering a fresh cry of agony; a new protest against new outrages. No, the wvorld has judged, and it will judge worthily, of our attitude, because European civilization un. derstands that our silence is not contentment-our inaction not a baseness. Useless demonstrations could not serve our cause. The anger of women is contemptible for a people that eomprehends the lmpoexance of its mission, and who only wish to accomplish it by the experienee gained at the expense of much blood and suffering. Is ib not shameful to see that so many poltroons, degenerate magistrates seated on the municipal benches, have not dared to speile in favour of the public caise, in favour of their clients, as they vere bound to do by their official position. These men are not only the enemies of our country, but of the Sovereign. To deceive the Prince is in fact the act of an enemy, and, in the position they hold, they have deceived hirm as much by their silence as by lies. " But the couutry will keep accomunt of their deserts. Times are changed, and the Government of the priests is precisely in the hands of men who will not admit this truth. That wlhich gives us confidence, however, is, that thatvwhich formerly was only a belief of secret conventieles has now become the opinion of the vast majority. It is no longer with mystery that liberty, or national dignity, is now spoken of; it is openly, in face of the world, and before aU the potentatrs of the earth. It is thus that liberty combats tyranny with success; it is thus that truth triumphs over error; and in tlis generous city it is esteemed an immortal glory to fight in the foremost ranks. II Thero remains for us long sacifices to make, and those imposed by actual circuimstances are stil more terrible. Toe tihumph of our cause caunot be delayed, but let us re2nember that, without *:rtue, it cannot succeed. Perseverance, then; great activity in ideas and acts; patience in our griefs, and faith in the futuro. The events which gene. rally prepare the true indep3ndence of a people are as giievous as the fatigues of the soldier previous to the battle. Let us lve and unite in one sole ides for the great day, and when the cy of deliverance moves ovr souls in immolating our affections on thi alter of the country we nmay act for one object only, to live and die free and independent." While His Holiness holds his revels in Bologna his lieges in the eternal city are preparing for his reception on the 5th of next month. The municipality has votid 7,000 scudi to be distributei to the people on the occasion at the rate of a paul a head, but this is not to be given in money to the poor themselves, but divided among the parish priests, who will buy bread and meat, and distribute rations of that value. In the meantime the Romans have been edified by the publication of a monster decree of 54 articles for the regulation of hackney coaclies. Every one wi 4ho acquainte&' with Rome must recollect the great waut of order and subordination among the class of Jehus who tilt furiously at the unfortunate pedestrian who does snot employ them, and who cheat abominably the still more wretched passenger who trusts himself to their guidance. The Romaus hailed w ith satisfaction, then, the issuing of. a decree that might be expected to impose a check on these ftuious extortioners, but great was their surprise and morbification to find, after wading through the whole 54 articles, that there was not a word about a tariff, so that the hackney coachmen remain as much as ever masters of the position,

TO THE EDITOR OF TIIE TIMES. Sir,-Ailow me to suggest how the 30O miles of the tele. graph cable might have been saved. Although too late to save the 300 miles it may he thle means of saving the 2,000. Let a vessel follow in the rear of the one that is payig out the cable, say, five mUes distant. Let it have a large ring by which the cable can pa35 through with the Wrea,test ease. temcieyta Should any accl ent ten occur w ith the machinery that it my sainbe rokn, he essl ten in the rear has simply to haul up th°e able,aiSts while the accident has been atranged, and then continue on its mission. By inserting this you will oblige, Your obedient servant. JOHN PMkWnppTr zi, ,pencer-street, ISlngtaD, Aug. 15.
THE SIT OF THlE NAT1ONAT. GALLERY.-The report of the Itoyal Commission on the site of the National Gallery was published on Saturday in the form of a blue. book of nearly 200 pages. The report proper appeared at lensth in T7ie Times of the 31st of July. As rega-ds the proceedings of the commission, it appears that on the 12th of March a resolution was proposed to the effect that tho evidence thitherto adduced, collectively considered, did no.t lead to any decisive conclusion against placing the new National Gallery within the metropolis * on which Mr. Faraday moved an amendment admitting this fact, but pointing to the advantage to be obtain.nd by "the removal of the gallery to a elearer and more airv site ;" which amendment was negatived by 3 to 2, MIr. Richmond voting with Mr. Faraday. The original resolution was afterwards adopted. At the meeting of the 7th of May a letter was read fromn Mr. Jnstice Coleridge, advocating the claims of the existing site in Trafalgar-square on the ground of its general accessib'iity. On the 21st of May Professor Faraday moved two resolutions-first, " that in respect of the future plan of tho National Gallery, the three leading considerations which should govern the choice of a site are clear space for a buildingof magnitude sufficient to provide for the pro. spective increase of the collection, accessibility to the public, and the preservation of the pictures; and, secondly, that, in the opinion of the commissioners, the first consgderation is essential in any case, that the second and third, although of extreme importance, are highly antagonistic, inasmuch as the removal of the pictures to a clearer but distant place takes away that accessibility which the present site, although, no doubt, with a great amount of wear and tear, provides." On these two resolutions the commissioners divided, affirming the first by 4 to 1, and the second by 3 to 2. Mfr. Richmond then proposed that after a resolution adopted on the 27th of April ( " that it is not expedient to break up or remove the collections of ancient sculpture and archaeology in the British Museum"), another resolution be added, to the effect that the future combinatlon of sculpture with painting shoald be provided for in the new National GaUery, "a primary use of which should be to preserve examples of the art of past ageq in all its branches in the order best adapted to exhibit their beauty and to illustrate their sequence and character." This resolution was negatived by three to two. It was also unanimously agreed that the choice of sites lay between the site of the present gallery (if sufficiently enlarged) and the castate at Kensington Gore. The result was that the chairman (Lord Broughton), the Dean of St. Paul's, and Mr. CoekereU voted for the present site in Tra. falgar-square, and that Mr. Richmond (alone) voted for ibe Kensington Gore estate. Professor Faraday declined to vots at all. his mind being equally balanced between the two sites. The evidence taken before the commission is ery voluminous. The witnesses examined were Sir C. Eastlake, P.R.A., Mr. H. Farrer, Mr. J. Nieu. wenhuys, Mr. J. Bentley, Mr. Knight, R. A., Mr. Cooke, A.B.A., Mr. Parris, Mr. Mulreadv, R.A., Mr. J. M. Smnith, Mr. Denning, Mr. Smart, Mr. A. Panzzi.

AMEVCA. LIVERPOOL, SuxNAT MosmTw. rhe Briti3h and North American ILoyal mail steamship Asia, Lott commander, has arrived from New York, with dates to the 5th inst., $917,944 in specie, and 40 passengers. On the 5th inst. the Aaia passed the screw steamEhip Edinburgh, from Glasgow, going in; and on the 8th, in lat. 44 19, long. 58 45, the United States' mail steamship Fulton, from Southampton. On the 13th, in lat. 51 20, long. 23 62, she signalled the American ship Eautern Queen, bound west, and the ship Siam standing south-west. The screw steamship 6lyde, from Glasgow, had arrived at Quebec on the 4th inst. The Royal mail steamship Persia hence, had arrived at New York. The President and some of the Ministers beincg absent from Washington there is little news from that place. The correspondent of the New York Herald writes that the Administration intend immediately to increase the United States' African squadron. It had in those waters three sloops of war, carrying only 50 guna, while the treaty required 80. The movement is said to be made with reference to suppre3sing the African slave trade, largely on the increase, and to promote commerce. The correspondent, writing on the 3d inst., says:- " Lord Napier had a long interview yesterday with General Cass relative to this subject, and also with reference to England's complicated affairs in the East, and to ascertain General Case's views on this, to him, serious question." The State Department had been officially advised of the passage of an Act by the Venezuelan Congress imposing an additional or subsidiary contribution of 10 per cent, upon the duties collected at the various Custom-houses of the Republic from and after the 1st of July last. A6 a sequel to the extraordinary Blundell case, which caused eo much sensation throughout the States, the woman Mrs. Cunningham, who was charged with being a participator in the assassination of Dr. Earvey Blundell, and who claimed to be married, had been placed under arrest on a charge of having gone through a sham accouchement, and professing to have been delivered of a child in order that she might secure the estate of her alleged husband. The New York- Shipping List ays 'IIt is the general belief that the wheat crop wi be the largest ever gathered in the United States, while tho accounts of the other cereals are not so adverse as to cause any apprehension for a full supply of food for the coming winter at a reasonable rate." The loss of the bark Monasco, of Warren, Maine, from Gottenburg for New York, together with 60 Swedish steerage passengers, near Bure, Newfoundland, had been reported from St. Pierre Miquelon. The captain, his wife, the crew, and six passengers were saved. The French war steaamer Tonnerre, from Vera Cruz, Havannah, had put into quarantine below New Orleans with yellow fever on board. A meeting of the citizens of the Fifth and Eighth Wards, New York, had been held for the purpose of perfectig arrangements for the organization of a Law and Order or Vigilance Committee. A similar committee was said to have existed for some time past in the Ninth Ward. The United States' frigate Roanoake had arrived at New York from Aspinwall with 204 Filibusters, part of Walker's army. One of them had died on the passage, and 27 had to be sent to the hospital. Lewisburg, Virginia, had been visited by a hailstorm which for extent and destruction was without precedent in that part of the country. The whole of the vegetable and growing crops were nearly annihilated. Some of the hailstones measured 5 inches in circumference. The rolling-mills of the Cambria Iron Company, near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, had been destroyed by fire, causing a loss of from $60,000 to $70,000. There was insurance on the property to the amount of 851,000. It was reported from New Orleans that Senator Rusk, of Texas, had committed suicide by shooting himself. Advices from Vera Cruz are to the 21st ult., and from the city of Mexico to the 17th ult. The elections continued to be favourable to Comonfort. A revolutionary movernent at Jalapa in the interest of Santa Anna was said to be causing the Government much uneasiness. The apprehended Spanish invasion eaused serious alarm, and the governors of the various provinces had been ordered to hold the National Guard in readiness. About 100 tons of rocks had fallen from one precipice on Goat Island, Niagara FalUs, abouxt 300 feet below the British Falls. injuring three out of four persons who were underneath; one, it was feared, fatally so. The Toronto Globe reports that a daring and successful robbery had been perpetrated in the back office of the Bank of Upper Canada, and cash to the amount of 4,0001. been carried off. A clerk named William WITaldon, who had plhndered the South Yorkshire Railway and River Don Coal Company of about 9001., and absconded in the screw steamer Canadian, hence to Quebec, had been arrested at Toronto by the detectives who were set on his track. He is to be brought back in the steamer from Quebec on the 15th instant. The payment of the Spanish and English claims had been renewed. Touching the resumption of payment, the .Estandarte says the Goveriiment was solely influenced therein by a sense of justice, and not at all by the actual state of "international relationa." The English claim of $240,000 hai been officially recognized. In the New York market money continued abundant and easily obtainable at the moderate rates of 8 to 9 per cent. on high grades of paper, according to maturity, and 11 to 15 per cent. for secondclass double and good single acceptances. Stocks were generally lower, with a fair degree of activity. Exchange in general had been firm, with a fair business, at 109i to 1094 per cent. on London; France, 5f. 17'c. to 5f. 171c. ; Hamburg, 3G6 to 3%~ The cotton-market continued dull, owing to the extreme high range to which prices had attained, but a slight advance had been gained, though not sufficient to warrant a change in quotations. State and Western flour had advanced 10c. under an increased demand and light receipts. The common grades of Canada flour had advanced 10c. Southern flour had been more active, and low and medium qualities had risen 10c. to 5oc. In wheat prices had not varied materially, and the business had been to a moderate extent. Rye remained inactive, and was 2c. lower. Oats quiet, and being less plentful had advanced 2c. Beef buoyant and with a brisk demand; and reduced stocks had advanced 5Qc. Bacon remained inactive. Lard advanced Jc. Cheese dull, at Ge. to 9ic. for common to prime. Crude turpentine firm at $4 per 2S)lb.; lower rates had been accepted. Spirits of turpentine had improved, the market closing firm at 461c for parcels on the spot in merchantable order, and 40Gc. to 47c. in shipping order. The iron-market was generally quiet. Salt was dull, with little variation in price. Tobacco without change. In freights business continued dull.
