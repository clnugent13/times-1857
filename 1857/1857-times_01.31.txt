Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MfONBY-MARKBET adITYINTBLLIGENOL.
Friday Evenlg.
The English funds opened with a tendency to steadiness this morning, but the market soon relapsed, and ultimately exhibited great heaviness. Consols for money were quoted yesterday after regular hours at 93 to i, and the first transactions to-day were at 930 to 4. From this they receded to 93, and the final price was 93 to J. For the new account on the 5th of March they left off at 93i to J. There was no political news, and the market was influenced solely by the pressure for money, which was increased by the arrangements in connexion with the foreign settlement and by the Indiahouse having withdrawn some amounts which they had temporarily lent upon stock. The rate for loans on Government securities was 64 per cent., and advances were obtained from the Bank on those terms. Bank Stock closed at 216 to. 218; Reduced, 93.4 to Â§; New Three per Cents., 934 to 4s; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98~ to 99; India Bonds 3s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills, os. discount to par.
In the discount-market there was undiminished activity, and the applications at the Bank were numerous.
The amount of gold taken from the Bank to-day for exportation was only about 10,0001.
Foreign securities were also heavy, and closed in some cases at a further decline. There continues to be great inactivity in business, but Turkish were more freely dealt in this afternoon. The Six per Cents, for money were negotiated at 944; and for the account at 944 and 93k. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions were at 1021. J, and J. Brazilian Five per Cents., 102i; the Fourand-a Half perCents., new, 97i; the Fiveper Cents., 102A; Mexican for account, 21k; Peruvian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 78; Portuguese Three per Cents., 43S and 44; Russian Five per Centb., 108k; the Four-and-a-ilalf per Centa. for money, 964; the small, 964 and i; Spanish Three per Cents. for money, 91 ; for the account, 40i; Belgian Fourand-a-Half per Cents, 98i and 98; Dutch Two-anda-Half per Cents., 64i and 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98 and 984.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates for Paris and Amsterdam were a shade lower. With regard to Hamburg there was rather an upward tendency.
The corn-market this morning was again rather less weak, and sales were effected at prices that could not have been obtained on Monday.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited business, with a tendency to lower rates.
The closing quotation of the French Three per Cents, this evening was 67f. 30c. for money and account, showing a,renewed decline of nearly a quarter per cent.
The letters from Paris to-day mention a current report that M. Mires, finding his Spanish loan of 3,000,0001. exceedingly heavy, intends to visit London next week to offer terms to the holders of the certificates of confiscated coupons. His proposition, it is alleged, will be to take these certificates in payment for his new stock, at a rate which would be equivalent to 121. in cash. It is improbable, however, that he would have allowed his terms to transpire previously to negotiation. The impression in Paris was that the London committee demand I51., and the Amsterdam holders 121. 10s. ; but in the London negotiations with M. Salamanca two or threeyears back the price insistedupon, itis believed, was only 101. 10s.
It is estimated that the amount to be taken out bythesteamer Ripon to India and China onthe 4th ot February will be between 700,0001. and 800,0001., nearly all in silver.
The colonial produce-markets during the week have exhibited increased buoyancy, and a further general improvement is apparent in most of the principal articles. Sugar bas been very active at higher rates, with large speculative transactions, partly based upon the reported heavy shipments from the Mauritius to Australia, &c., although the prewent reduced state of the stock in this country is regarded by some as alone sufficient to account for the reaction. To-day there was less excitement, but the closing prices were still about 6d. to Is. higher than on the 23d inst. Numerous parcels of colonial have changed hands on the spot, as well as to arrive, the lower qualities, lately most depressed, finding eager buyers. Several cargoes of Manilla also realized 30os. to 30s. 6d. for unclayed, and 34s. to 35s. for clayed. The Dutch company have declared 70,300 baskets Java for sale on the 18th of March next. The coffeemarket is extremely firm. Plantation Ceylon finds ready buyers at about 2s. advance. Native growth is worth 57s. for good ordinary. A cargo of good firsts Rio has been taken for a near port at a full price. Accounts of the deficiency in the Java crop have stimulated the speculative feeling previously existing. Extensive purchases have been made in common rice, but the better ldnds of white remain inactive. Nothing of interest has transpired in spice beyond the quarterly sales of cinnamon, which went off rather heavily, although the greater part found buyers at an average reduction of about 2d. per lb. Saltpetre went at a further decline in the middle of the week, but today there was a better demand, the smallness of the stock and the moderate shipments from Calcutta leading to a renewed inquiry from speculators at slightly improved rates. In the tea-market the transactions have been considerable, all descriptions of good and fine realizing daily advancing rates. Since the receipt of the letters by the overland mail common congou has been largely dealt in at from Is. lid. to Is. lid., the news being considered very favourable, especially for the better grades. Public sales took place on Tuesday, Wednesday, and to-day. Importers held firmly and many congous were withdrawn. To-day 1,200 packages of fine new season's green teas realized extremely high ratee.
At a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Company to-day the report, an abstract of which appeared in T1e Times of the 26th inst., was brought under consideration. The result of operations was generally regarded as unsatisfactory, and a lengthened discussion followed. Both the progress of the land sales and the returns from the colieries are considered to indicate discouraging management, and it was urged that an investigation should be instituted. It was contended, likewise, that the expenditure, home and colonial, is larger than would be justiHiable even under favourable circumstances, and complaints were also made of the accounts not having been rendered in a clear and intelligible manner. A variety of suggestions was offered for improving the value of the property, and remarks were made on the advantages likely to accrue from the introduction of railways and the cultivation of the mulberry tree. With respect to the collieries, t' heir development has been so costly that it is considered by some of the proprietors, possessing local experience, that a lease of them separately or collectively to other parties would be the best method of turning them to profitable account. The vend of coal, it was also alleged, might be greatly increased by improving Port Ne'weastle, so as to give ready access to vessels of large size employed in the Indian, China, and Australian trade. After explanations from the directors, it was mutually agreed that a committee of consultation should be appointed to report to a special meeting hereafter on the
general affairs of the company.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day Mr. W. Smith, banker, of Watford and Hemel lempatead, passed his last examination on a supplemental balancesheet. The question of the liability of the executors of Mr. Whittingstall (the late parGner of Mr. Smith) to the debts of the bank was ordered to stand over for private discussion.
The following letter re arding the European and Indian Junction Telegraphs Company was published this afternoon in the Stock-Exchange -
"European and Indian Junction Telegraph Company
(Limited), Greshsm-house, Old Broad-street, Jan.29. "Sir,-In reply to your communication of this date, I beg to inform you that itis not proposed to make any caU on the shares in this company until an agreement has been entered into with contractors of undoubted respectability and capital who will undertake to construct the line of telegraph proposed for such a sum as wil leave an ample margin on the capital of the company for payment to the sbareholders of a dividend of 6 per cent. per annum on any calls that may be made, and for expenses that may he in. curred during the term of construction, or for any contingency that may arise.
"The offical communication from the Treasury to which you refer states that Her Majesty's Government will be prepared as soon as 20 per cent, of the capital of this company has been paid up to exfeute a contract, stipulating to pay, conjointly with the East India Company, from the date of the completion of, the line, for the execution of which they allow two years, 12,0001 a-year for 25 years, or so much of it as ahall be equivalent to a dividend of 6 per cent. per annum ; but that when the earnings of the company shaU be equivalent to a dividend exceeding 12 per cent. Her Majesty's Government and theEastIndia Company shall have
the power of making a reduction in the tariff for conveying 5meges, but not to a grester extent than, calculated upon the traffic of the two preceding years, will be equal to a dividend of 12 per cent. The Government further state that in no ame shall their annual payment be less than the sum to vlbich the work performed for them by the company shall amount, calculated at the usual tariff rates, and they further stipUlate that, ' to insure to the Government that supervsion and control to which their stake in the enterprise ]ustly entitles them, the Treasury shall have the power of

er require ' that a statement of the accounts of the company, showing the receits and expenditare and the amount of profit, shall be furnished at least once in each year to the Treasury, on behalf of Her Majesty's Governsent, and to the East India Company, and that such means as they think necessary shall be afforded of verifying such accounts. I have to inform you that the directors anticipate beina able to announce in a few days that the Hon. East India Company has placed the services of Sir William O'Shaughnessy at the disposal of this company as consulting engineer.
" Any farther information that you may desire I shall have much satisfaction in affording.

(rFoM OUR OWN CORUESPONDMi'.)
PAMIS, TisunsDA, JAN. 29, 6 P.x.
The appeal of Verger came on before the Court of Cassation to-day. The proceedings opened at halfpast 11 o'clock, and the crowd was nearly as coniiderable as on the day of the trial at the Court of Asize. M. Legagneur, Counsellor to the Court of Cassation, presented his report, explaining the three points on which the sentence was sought to be reversed, and which were put forth in the paper presented by M. Morin in support of the appeal.
L. Morin, on the part of the appellant, then sddressed the Court. The appeal of a convict sentenced to capital punishment, he said, was one of those cases -which no member of the bar could refuse to undertake; humanity, justice, and the traditions Of the bar imperatively required a defence. flavnp been intrusted by the Court with that diflcut task, he should endeavour to perform it torthe best of his ability, and master the painful emnnions to which it would give rise. He was the more encouraged to do so as, on the present occasion, the only question was one of law, and to that he should address himself before that Supreme court, that judicial Senate, the guardian and protector of legal forms, the conservator of the authority and purity of the law. He had nothing vwhatever to say on the crime itself of which the prisoner was found guilty by the Court below. He could only repeat, with every man of sense, that it was abominable,a virtuous prelate stabbed to the heart during a religious solemnity, and by the hand of a priest 'whom he had relieved in his necess ties and who was in the act of blessing him while he knelt among the crowd. Even now, he (1. Morin) could niot understand how the prisoner could have committed such a crime-a crime which had produced stupefaction among the clergy and among society at large. It was a crime unprecedented, without explanation, unles by insanity. He did not plead madness at the moment of the act,-that was the duty of the prioner's oounsel at the Court of Assize, and that duty he had scrupulously performed. He could not be permitted to discuss that question after the verdict of guilty had been pronounced. He would maintain that there was madness now which required a suspension, and he would be authorized to do soby thefundamental principles which he put forward in the case of the appeal of the convict Gilbert, and which were confirmed by the remarkable judgment of the Court of Cassation on the26th January, 1839; foratwhateverperiodmental derangement disclosed itself the judge ought to pause from proceeding against an unfortunate wretch who bad neither the consciousness of his crime and of his situation, nor the sentiment of the rights and the duties of defence. He should, perhaps, be required to produce proofs and juridical documents. He confessed he had none-he had no proofs but the scandalous violence which had outraged witnesses and judges alike, at the momentthey exhibited the most admirable patience-violence so extravagant as to necessitate the removal of the accused from the court-of the accused, who was on trial for his life. He would not here appeal to his own personal opinions, nor to the manifestations and scientific opinions which he constantly mot with, because it was erroneonsly believed that he was bound to prove insanity, so far as he could judge from pubhc opinion. It was only, then, to the examination of the proceedings themselves that his arguments would refer. The question was this -.-Had the forms and delays required by the law for the sacred right of defence been observed since the decision of the Court for putting the accused on his trial, and which decision had been maintained ? This was what he could, and what he was bound to disDute, in the development of his arguments for Rnnulling the sentence. M. Morin then explained his grounds for supporting the appeaL. The first related to the constitution of the Court of Assize. He admitted that conformably with the letter of the law, and with the decree of the Court of Cassation of the 15th of November, 1855, the Chief President might preside at the Court of Assize by retaining as first asse3sor the President named by the Keeper of the Seals; but, he asked, was not an ordinance necessary for the sake of regularity, which should state why the composition of the Court was changed, since the change did not take place in consequence of any unforeseen circumstance, but a change of authority arbitrarily substituting one President for another ? The second ground which 14. Mlorin argued was founded on the shortening of the period allowed for the trial. He insisted particularly that 48 hours had not intervened between the rejection of the appeal and the appearance of the accused before the Court of Assize; and he asked whether, in law, this delay was sufficient for the accused to prepare his defence and summonhis witnesses ? According to counsel for the prisoner the period was so short that the accused could not be forced to accept the trial. No doubt, the object and the result of the law of the 10th of June, 1855, were to prevent prisoners from escaping from justice by dilatory proceedings; but, iu the present case, the appeal was regularly drawn up; consequently, the code of 1808 s'sould have been followed. Now, accordina to article 296, the accused had five days from hi; examination to appeal against the order for trial. If he allowed this period to pass without an appeal thepresumptionwasthat he had prepared his defence; but, according to precedent,it was not the same when he had chosen to demand that the proceedings should be annulled. In that case, the presumption was that he had devoted his time to prepare his appeal, and not to his defence before the Court of Assize. He should, consequently, have been allowed a further delay. Tf not, it might be said that he was liable to be called before the Court of Assize immediately after the notification of the rejection of his appeal, and he might thus find it utterly impossible to summon his witnesses, of whom the list must be notified to the public prosecutor 24 hours previously. Tn fact, the accused protested at the trial, and demanded the time necessary for summoning his witnesses, of whom he had furnished a list to the Attorney-General. It was replied that the facts on which he wished to examine his witnesses were irrelevant; but that was a contradiction which could not be admitted in an absolute manner, for it was not possible to knowwhether those witnesses would not have cleared up some doubts and established the insanity. Arriving at the third point, which he declared to be the most important, M. Morin maintained that, whether according to the law of 9th September, 1835, well considered, or even according to the decree which, conformably with the right established by that law, preseribed that the accused should be taken back to prison, the effect of the expulsion ought to cease at the concluision of the trial, and the accused ought to have been brought back to hear the sentence, or at least he should have had an opportunity of answering whether he had anything to add to his defence. M. Morin admitted that the practice was coutrary in Paris, but he maintained that this practice was contrary to the spirit of the law, and he cited, in support of his argument, various precedents, amoag others, the case of Madame Laffarge at Limoges, and the trial before the Court of Peers in April, 1834. He then concluded by dernanding that the proceedings should be quashed, as well in the name of the principles of defence as in the name of justice, so much interested in a new examination which should permit the degree of insanity to be verified, which had not yet been ascertained to a certainty.
After the speech of M. Morin the proceedings
were suspended for some minutes.
On their being resumed, the President called on the Procureur-General (M. Royer) to address the Court. . Royer went over the incidents of the trmsl.before the Court ofhAsize, and alluded to the pi1ifu1 effect Hnouced by the violent conduct of the accused on that occasion. Such things, he said should cease at the threshhold of the Court of Casaa tion. After saying a few words on the accused himself, he entered minutely into the tbree arguments put forwrard by the counsel for the appellant. These arguments he refuted at some leagth, and he ended by calling on the Court to reject the appeal.
When the Procureur closed his address the judges
retired to their chamber for consultation. Th appeal has been rejected.
The Monwiteiu, alluding to remarks made by aome of the Paris journals as to conltemplated changes in the organization of the lBank of France, and.particularly on the increase of its capital, publishes a note, containing the views of the Emperor Napoleon I, w hich was sent to the Bank of F in 1810 by order of His Majesty. The following is a summary of its contents. After stating that the original capital of the Bank, which was fixed by the law of An 8 at 30,000,000, had been successively increased to 45,000,000 and to 90,000,000, it goes on to say-
" The capital was not intended to be used in discount transactions, which should be entirely carried on by means of its notes. Its capital ought to remain entirely unconnected with discount operations. The formation of the capital of a bank is a preliminary ct as distinot from its operations as a privileged disoounting establishment as the deposit of a sum of caution money by a person employed is from his management, properly so caled. The condition of furnishing a capitalis only imposed on those whofound a bank as a security for those who take its notes egainst any error or impradent conduct on the part of its managers. A bauk which only issues notes in exchauge for good bills at two or three months' date at the utmost ought to have conatantly in hand a sum in such securities at least equal to the notes it has issued, and thus be in a situation to withdraw aUl its notes from circulation in three months, by the receipt of the amount of the bills it has in hand, without inter. fering In the slightest way with its capital, The capital furnished by the shareholders of a bauk being, strictly spealdng, only a kind of caution money given to the public, it might be almost said that a bank which had acquired a reputation for infallibility would not even require to touch its capital for purposes of discount, its notes being quite sufficient for that purpose."
The note then alludes to the formation of theBank of England in 1692 with a capital of 24,000,000, and states that although its first act was to lend almost the whole of that capital to the Royal Treasury of William III., its founder, yet it carried on with success its discount operations from the very first moment of its being established by means of its notes. It next alludes to the care and attention necessary in carrying on discount operations, and the strict attention required in the investigation of the solvency of the different parties whose names are affixed to the bills presented for discount. The document condudes as followsE-
" The capital of a bank should, by the form of its invet. ment, remin, so to speak, always immoveable, in order that no suspicion should ever be felt of its having been diminished; it ought at the same time to remain in a state to be immeitely available, so as to be ready to cover ny losses which might arise on bills. A part of this capital should form a reserve in bullion, and that part can p reduce no interest. The best use th3t could be made of the rernainder appears to be its investment in securities of the public debt of the country, negotiable in the market, xince such an investment unites to the advantage of securinga favourable and reglarly paid interest tht of being Immediatelyavailablewhen reqtsiredbytbebank;and although this latter eventuality could never happen to a bank that has only issued its notes in exchange for good discountable securities, yet prudence always requires the case to be pro vided for. A bank ought to maintain itself in such a state a to be able to wind up its affairs at any moment; in the first place, with respect to the holders of its notes, by the realization of the bills which ithas in hand; and next, with respect to its sbareholders, by the distribution to each of them of the amount of capital which he has furnished. In order never to expire, it ought to be able to come to an end at any moment."

TURKEY.
(ROM OlUB OWN COREsONDIsT.)
CO-NSTANTIIOPLE, JAN. 19.
In your leader of the 27th of last month on Turkey you take up financial reform as the first thing to be accomplished. It is impossible to lay too much stress on this subject; it is one of immediate necessity, for if things are allowed to go on as they do now a bankiruptcy is inevitable. It is utterly useless to establish banks, or to open or
guarantee railways, unless some order be intro-. duced into the administration of the revenue, and the scope for improvement in this respect is unbounded, It may be said without exaggeration that without any extraordinary financial skill-only by common honesty and order-the revenue, instead of showing a regular deficit every year, ought to yield a surplus of at least 2,000,0001., and this without augmenting the taxes a single para.
I-will give you a statement of the finances, as far as I can ascertain them. Of course it would be impossible to vouch for every item in all its details, but you may rely on its general correctness-

Besides these there are the tributes of Egypt, Tunis, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Servia-in aln about 50,000,000 of piatres, or about 450,0001., 'which are employed to pay the interest of the debts contracted in Europe.
Thus, at first appearance, revenue and expenditure seem to balance each other, but this is more in appearance than reality, for at the end of every financial year it is found that the revenues do not quite yield the sims for which they have been put down. This arises from the circumstance that most of the branches of revenue are farmed, and this farming is a regular jobbery. It is true that all officials are strictly forbidden to interest themselves in the
farming of any branch of the revenue, but there are cases every day before the Judicial Committee of the Council of State in which officials are accused of this crime, and sometimes convicted. But the affair is usually so well managed that no proofs can be brought against the guilty, and the consequence is that scarcely a single branch of the revenue is farmed without some one high in office being directly or indirectly interested in it. Now, it happens every year that one or more of the contractors, after having collected the revenues assigned 'to them, become insolvent, always taking good care to fail for a much larger sum than that which they have deposited as security. This Is especially the case in bad years, for, as the calculations in farming the revenues are made after the returns of the preceding year, their profits in such a case do not come up to their expectations. Powerful protectors, timely excuses, and all kinds of pretexts nearly always insure impunity. While the revenues are in this way alienated each year, there are always far more indispensable expenses in each department than were anticipated in the budget. As, moreover, the revenues do not come in regularly, it happens that each Ministry is always in want of money just at the moment when there is none in the Exchequer, and must, therefore, conltract ruinous loans at a fabulous percentage. Each Ministry is in this respect its own financier, and the result of these Ministerial financial operations is just as great an increase in the expenditure
of all as there is a deficit in the revenae. ID this way, at the eind of each year the expenses ilways considerably exceed the revenue. But a heavier pull on the Exchequer than all these defalcations is the ruinous demands of the Sultan. His personal civil list is 1,000,0001. sterling, or a little less than one-si-th of the whole revenue of the State. Besdes this he dispenses pensions to the amount of more than 200,0001. sterling, and be it understood that these pensions are only personal favours, not-rewards for merit, for the pensions of invalided soldiers and sailors are put on the budget of the army and navy. The pensioners paid by the Sultan are superannuated palace servants and others who find protectors in the palace. Tho phrase isthat the Sultan grants these pen,sions on the civil list, but this is only in so far true as they forim part of what is called the Imperial Treasury, but in reality they are paid out of the revenue, and the 1,000,0001. sterling of the Sultan is not touched: that is, the Sultan is liberal with the State money, and net with his own. But this is not all. Although having in proportion a larger income by far than any other Sovereign in the world, Queen Victoria's, for instance, not forming 1-50th of the revenues of England, the civil list never suffices, and whenever money is Wanted an advance on the civil list of the next year is demanded, and nearly always obtained in one way or another. At this moment a heavy demand of this kind disturbs the sleep of the Grand Vizier. Not less than 500,0001. is asked. The Sultan wants to marry two of his daughters-one betrothed to Ilhami Pasha, son of Abbas Pasha, of Egypt, and the other to the son of Ahmed Fethi Pasha, Grand Master of Artillery. The idea was first to contract a loan. Since maling loans was begurn it was found that it would be the least troublesome way of obtaining money. As long as there were "Feringhis" and others willing to lend money, at whatever rate, it was much more agreeable to take it from them than to battle for it with a Minister. But even these complaisant people begin to ask, "Where is your security ?" Redscid Pasha is asked for it. The Grand Vizier represents the impossibility, but in vain,-the urging continues.
From this sketch you may see where the evil lies. If for the introduction of political and social reforms the first thing wanted is that the Turks should be left alone by the representatives of the Foreign Powers, the first thinog in finance is that the Government should be liberated from the pretensions of the Sultan. It is impossible to get anything like order into the finances so long as the Sultan can draw ad lilMWo on the reaources of the country. In a country where the Sovereign is absolute this can scarcely be done directly,-for what prevents the Sultan from changing his Ministers until he finds one willing to satisfy his demands ?-but perhaps the very evil contains its remedy. When passing through Epirus ana Themsaly I could not but be struck by the number of roads and other public works constructed by Ali Pasha of Janina, now all in ruins, and I could not but pity the peoplewho had to pay for them all; but when 1asked how he could do it without reducing his whole people to the greatest misery, I was told he did it all by taking alone, and not allowing any one else to take; he took much, but even his grasping disposition fell short of what is plundered now by thousands, and the people were far more prosperous and the country rapidly improving. This seems to me to embody the financial secret of despotic governments; and if the Sultan could be induced to enterinto it, and leave free hands to Redachid Pasha in removing the financial abuses, reducing the useless host of idle employcs, and punishing without pity all cases of peculation without distinction, he would double his own revenue, and yet have a large surplus in the Exchequer for works of public utility.
There is not a single departnent in the central Government in which the officials could not be reduced by at least one-half, if not two-thirds; and not only would the Exchequer gain by it, but likewise the despatch of business, wrhich now, -properly speaking, concerns nobody. It is the Minister who does everything, if it is done at al; you have only to go to the Porte and count how many you see at work, and how many gossiping and smoking, and you wil come to the conclusion that 20 intelligent clerks in each department would be quite sufficient, where there are now a hundred times as many. All the deliberative councils, of which there are numbers, are likewise replete with well-fed and ueless members, all sent there by palace protection. Every one of these councils receives at least twice as many members as it ought to have, getting pay of from 1,0001. to 3,0001. a-year. These useless offcials absorb at least one-sixth of the whole revenue.
Another abuse which, if removed, would save great expenditure, is the financial independence of each department. The War, Ordnance, and Naval Departments are especially conspicuous in this respect. Everything is done by contract, and in every contract the heads of the departments, and not rarely the Ministers, share. The head of the Government has no power to check this abuse, for again the palace interferes.
These are only a few of the abuses, for it would take more than a letter to enumerate them, but from the little I have said you may see that if the Sultan left Redschid Pasha with hands free the latter could easily give him half of the surplus which would be gained. Unfortunately the Sultan is in the hands of those whose interest it is to keep up the present disorder, and he is even too weak to let others do wvat he has not the energy to do himself.
The end of last week was fertile in concessions. The concession for the railroad from the Danube to the Archipelago has been sent after Mr. Layard, who has a term of three months after the receipt of the concession to get up the company. I don't think there ever was a project presented to the Turkish Govermment which was so universally approved by all and found less objections. lndeed, in several instances more was given than asked. Thus, Mr. Layard asked only for two months to get up the company-they gave him three. He asked only for the grant of forets, mines, and quarries in the immediate vicinity of the line-they gave him 10 miles. The fact is, that every one in persuaded of the great boon which the line will confer, and that it has been prompted by a sincere desire of benefitting the country. As you know, the concession was asked and received without any diplomatic interference, and the whole matter was settled in 11 days. Here is a proof that the Turks will do things better if they are left alone than if they are interfered with.
General Chesney has likewise got his Irade, or concession, and leaves to-day. He has a general concession for the whole line down to Bussorah, but only the execution of the first section as far as the Euphrates has been settled. The estimate of this line, which will be of from 120 to 130 mfles, is 1,400,0001. which as a maimum is g2uaranteed 6 per cent. If the line begins to pay, the profits above 6 per cent. win, as v te Aidinsmyrna hne, be employed to pay back the guarantee which the Turkish Government has advaneed; when this is done all profits above 7 per cent. are to be divided between the Government and the company. The detailed survey of the line was continued all the tine the negotiations about the concession were going on.
The Turkish telegraph line, which has been interrupted for some days, is now again in order, and one of the first messages it brought was that of the acceptance of the bank project by Messrs. Willins's principals. This acceptance arrived on Saturday last.

VIElNNA, JA1w. 27.
The great question of the day in this part of the world is whetherthe general and complete amnesty [granted by the Emperor to political offenders includes those persons who, having been condemned to death in contumuteiam, were executed in effigy.
IThe general opinion is that the amnesty does not
include the persons in question, " as they are dead in the eye of the law," but several of the most distinguished lawyers inthiscity maintain thatexecuI tion in cont4iaam is " a mere legal formality." My ingenious legal friends also make a very great difference between a general amnesy and a general pardon. By an amnety they understand
" an act of oblivon or obliteration ;" bya pardon, "a mere remission of penalty." The foregoing information will probably be of little interest to the great majority of your readers, but it will be extremely acceptable to some few of them. The clemency displayed by the Emperor to his Italian subjects has revived the courage of the Magyars, and they now express their conviction that a general amnesty will soon be pro-
claimed in Hungary. Aocording to the Deutsche AllgerwineZeitsngg, His Majesty will visit some of the great European Courts during the summer, in d of

According to direct advices of the 17th from St. Petersburg Count de Morny and his bride will not leave for Paris before the month of May. The newly-married couple were to have left soon after the marriaae, which took place on Wednesday, the 21st, but A. de Morny received instructions to po3tpone his departure. It is generaUy stated that the
rritish and French troops are to be withdrawn from Greece in April or May, but the Greeks are evidently somewhat afraid that the occupation will be prolonged. A few weeks since the Greek troops on the frontiers of Thessaly wounded and captured a young robber of remarkably effeminate appearance. On being taken to the hospital, the robber proved to be a Christian girl, who two years before had been carried off from her family by the TurkL The unfortunate girl, who was armed with pistols, gun, and yataghan, had during the two years of her captivity been obliged to share in all the professional enterrises of the robbers.
It was only on the 1st of January that the Moldavian Bank began its operations at Jassy, and it is aready about to establish a branch bank at Galatz. The Vienna Credit Bank has been established some 14 or 15 months, and it has until now done nothing but appoint its three directors and speculate on 'Change. M. Richter, the principal director of the Credit Bank, went to Pesth a few days ago, but he is said to have met with little sauccers, as the Hu rtill flatter themrselves that the Emperor will permit them to have an independent provincial bank.
During the last few yearsr hials have been made whether as gtood silk; may not be produced in Huangary as in Lombardy, and Count Gustavus Hadik has just s,ent specimens of silk to Peth which have given perfect satisfaction to the manufacturers. The silkwormns were reared and. kept at an establishment belonging to the Count at Szemlak, on the Marmarosch (in the couanty of the same name), and the silk they produced was, spun in his " Filanda," w vhich was7 cons,tructed after a Venetian modeL.
The Wiener Zeitung contains the text of a convention for the mutual " extradition" of criminals, which has just been concluded between this Government and that of the United States. The crimes for which malefactors are to be delivered up to the authorities of the country in which the offence was committed are, "Murder, asrault with murderous intent, piracy, arson; forgery, false coining, aud embezzlement of public funds."
According to a telegraphic despatch of the 26th, the Emperor made an excursion to Pavia on the
24th (Saturday), and returned to Milan in the even- I ing. After the promulgation of the general amnesty, in the afternoon of the 23d, the streets of the city were crowded, and the acclamations of the people were loud when their Majesties drove to the Scala.
There was a very marked improvement on 'Change to-day. Some kinds of "industri4" stock rose 3 or 4 per cent., and the rate of exchange on London fell full J per cent.
SWITZERLAND.
A letter from Berne of the 24th inst. announces t.he receipt by the Federal Council of a telegraphic dlespatch from the Swiss Ambassador Extraordinary ast Paris, stating that the Conference relative to the affair of Neuchatel would be held at Paris, and would shortly commence. The first question is thus decided in favour of Switzerland. A German town was first proposed, but the Federal Council opposed that, and demanded, first Paris, and in the second place London. It is expected at Berne that the Kin' of Prussia will resume diplomatic relations with Switzerland. The return of ML Sydow, the late Prussian Minister, however, to Berne is impossible, as it appears from documents in the Federal archives that he was seriously implicated in the late insurrection.

The Thieves Of St. Petersburgh.-A letter from
THE THIEVES OF Sf PEERESBU -G.-A letter from
St. Petersburg, of the 20th, in the ConatitU5ionn71, says - " The police have just arrested 15 individuals, charged with attacks on and robbery of isvotchiks, or drivers of sledges. The plan adopted by these men was as follows :-At a late hour in the evening two of them took their seats in a sledge. and ordered the driver to proceed to some distant part of the city, or to the extremity of some faubourg, where at that hour the streets were completely deserted. At a given moment one of the robbers threw over the head of the driver a net, with a cord having a running knot to come tightly ronnd his neck, so that in order to avoid strangulation he gave to his assailants all the money he had received throughout the day. Dnring the last fortnight Upwards of 100 drivers have been victimlzed by this trick.
lhere is now in the prison of St. Petersburg a skilful rogue who has directed his attention to higher game. Having heard that the Archbishop of St. Petersburg had left his pastoral cross at a jeweller's to undergo repairs, he went to the shop and said, 'I come from Monsergneur the Archbishop, who requests that you will immediately give me the cross which he has left with you to repair. He has been sent for to the palace, and he cannot present himself before the Emperor without the ins' of his dignity.' ' That is very true,' replied the jeweller, ' but as I have not the honour of knowing you, and as nothing more resembles an honest man than a rogue, we will go together and deliver to Monseigneur the cross he has confided to me.' ' That is just what I wish,' said the thief, ''and if you wil allow n e. 1 wi give you a seat in my carriage in order the sooner to reach the palace of his Eminence, who muAt be with the Emperor precisely at 12.' Five minutes after, the jeweller and his companion arrived at the Archbishop's and entered the waiting-room, which is open to every one. The messenger requested him to wait a moment, and he would inform his Eminence of his arrival. In about two or three miinutes he returned with his head uncovered and without his cloak, and said, ' Monseigneur the Archbishon is at this moment engaged with the Archbishop of Kie , and therefore cannot come to you, and begs you to deliver to me the cross.' The jeweller, finding himself in the palace and with, as he believed, one of the servants, no longer hesi. tated, but gave the cross and returned to his shop. About a week after the Archbishop came himself for the cross, The polce being then informed of the trick set to work, and tucceeded mn arresting the thief. He remains in the hands of justice, but where the valuable article which he took is remains a mystery."
PRICE OF LEATEE, BooTs, AD SHOES.-In consequence of the recent great advvnce in the price of leather it has given rise to a general movement m the boot and shoe trade throughout the country, with aview to place the manufactured article upon a footing with regard to price commensurate with that of the raw material. Meetings have been held in several towns in Yorkshire, including Hull, Bradford, and Leeds, and at the whole of them a general advance in the price of boots and shoes was determined,upon. The ,eeds meeting, which was numeroudy attend by the trade, took place on Monday evening at the Royal Hotel. Mr. Stead, of the firm of Messrs. Stead and Simpson, was called to the chair, and he communicated some interesting informiation in reference to the cause of the advance in the price of leather, the prospects of the trade, and the probable future supply o the raw material. At the commeneement of the Russian war Mr. Stead stated that we had a surplus stock of leather generally in the country owing to the larzomports from France, Germany, Portugal, Australia, and -menrc Before the war, however, when we were importing largely of leather .from America, the Americans were, on the ether hand, importing our green hides to the extent of thousands per month. The consequence was that after the requisite period for tanning the large number of English hides in America, which ought to have been in our possession as leather, caused the balance of supply to be decidedly against this country; and the importation to England ah now almost entirely
oeased, prices being as high as, and in some articles higher, both in America and on the continent, than they are here. These facts, with the falling off in the imports of the raw material from Buenos Ayres and other parts, account in a great measure for the present prices,unprecedented since the years 1825-6. Mr. Stead added that, though at the outbreak of the war with Russia, there was a surplus stock of leather in this country that event alone, apart from other circumstanoes, was sufficient to absorb it, as our present position proved. The Australian and other markets were also, even at the present time, taking an immense amount of manufactured goods, adding another serious drain upon our resources and supply. In the conrse Of his remarks Mr. Stead also read the following compaa

Lord BRouGHA, in introducinlg the deputation, said, that the members of the Conference who were present represented London, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristolinshort, all the great leading towns of the oountry. The gentlemen presernt were also the leading inembers of the conference which was held yesterday and on the previous day-a conference which was of a most satisfactory nature in many respects, particularly in the general disposition of the members to oonfine themselves to practical and attainable objects. Although there were some differences of opinion, as there always would be in large assemblies, there was a general unanimity of opinion among the meniber. He ought to add that lee never saw any meeting where there had been greater temperance, both with reprd to the manner and matter of the dicussion. (ear, hear.) He could only say that the importance of the conference was only equalled by that which was held four years ago for the assimilation of the 3mercantile law of the three kingdoms. The unanimity which prevaled on the present occasion was the more remarkable because the scope of the conference was more widely extended, and the subjects incomparably more numerous and importan. The first point on whioh there was a general agreement was in reference to bankruptcy and in. solvency, that being one of four or five important subjects which came under consideration. There was an unanitnous opinaon that in bankruptcy and insolvency some change was absolutely nec , p lyaimprovementin the law itself, and partly in its admminitration. On the details there was some difference of opinion, but none on the general pri. ciple. There had boen great sufferingto the tr-adng community fromthegrievances inthopresentstateof thelew,and he thought that the had a just right to complain tIat 2S,W0. a-year was squan ered away in the administrationof the law. That amount of compensation pressed greatly upon the suitors, because the whole of theeD expenses were paid out of fees. It was a great burden on the trading community. (Hear.) There vwas also the burden of offioers' salaries, and he conference expressed a hope that it would be found practicable to throw these burdens off the shoulders of the creditors on to the consolidared fund. As to the offices of manager, broker, and accountan, the conference was' of opinion that those offiees might be abolished, and tne duties dchared by the official assignee. (Hear.) There was also great dissatisfaction with the system of appeals, the present system being extremely burdensome to the parties; and one gaat evil was, that the appeal was made from the judge who knew all the circumstances, and had the power of knowing the conduct of a bankrupt, to a judge who had not had such opportunity, and who to a great extent must be ignorant of the real state of the case. It had been very much complained of that there was a very irregular attendance of the Bankraptcy Commissioners, and a strong feeling prev ailed that their more regular attendance shoull be rendered compulsory. There was also a general feeling that the bankruptcy and the insolvency sbould be placed under one tribunal, and that traders and non-traders should be placed in the same category. They were also of opinion that the winding-np jurisdiction should be transferred to the Bankruptcy Court, so that such
ceedings as had been recently of thtcase u beingb
died about from one court to another, might be done away with. There were several other important cases before the conference having only an indirect ad contingent bearing upon the bankruptcy laws, which were fully considered Among these was . Craufurd's Judgment and Execution Bill, which was of a very important character, and which had more than once paed the House Of Commons The conference had expressed an opinion that it would be very desrble that the bill should without delay be passed into law. (Hear, hear.) Upon the subject of the general regis tration of partnerships there was a very general courrence. On the question of limited liability there was at first a dlsposition to mix it up with partnership regiStrationS, and it was not pressed. the noble and learned lord then Ske of the decisions of the conference on the Statute of
auds, tribunals of commerce, and the other matters which had been under discussion. He added that he had made this statement as chairman of the conference, to prevent the necessity of a general discussion, which would occupy too much o his Lordship's time.
lord PAnMUMSTON said,-It is, I trust, quite unnecessary to assure you that Her Majesty's Government will ive the greatest possible attention to the matters which Lord Brougham has now explained, and which I understand will bemorefullyexplainedinapaper which wil hbegiven tome. It is, I am aware, impossible to exagerato the importance of the matters to which Lord Brougam, on your behalf, has adverted. Our laws are in many respects excellent, but it is impossible to deny that the progressive development of the commercial relations of a great country like this must from time to time, require that those laws should be alterea and improved, and no doubt it is the duty of Her Majesty's Government to direct their attention to such improvements, and they must feel greatlv indebted to those who bring to bear their practical kow edge in aid of the Government, pointing out the defects, and also the remedy to be applied
such defects. Any representation, therefore, comin from any quarter on matters of sueh importance would naturally receive most attentive consideration from the Government, but coming from such a meeting as that I have the honour of now seeing, representing the great commercial interests of almost al the great commercial towns of the country, it must necessaly command the attention of the Government, and, more than that, the high authority of the noble lord who has been chosen as the organ of the meeting upon the subject-were he alone in the room-would be sufficient to command the greatest deference and respect on the part of Her Majesty's Government. We all know how he has devoted a long life to the promotion of improvements in the law, and Her Majesty's Government would have felt greatly indebted to his great experience for any opinion he might have advanced, even if he had not been backed by the great authorities I have now the honour of seeing. Any opinions from him alone -would necessarily command the most perfect attention on the part of the Government. (Hear, hear.) Of course you will not expect that I should say more on the present occasion than that the subjects you have pointed out shall receive the most deliberate attention of Her Majesty's Government; and on the part of myself and my colleagues I must thankl you for coming here to tell me the result of your deliberations. (Cheers.)
The deputation then retired.

Western Australia.
7VESTERY AUSTRALIA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Allow me to say a few words in answer to Captain Henderson's imputations on my ccuracy with regard to Western Australia.
My principal objection to that country as a penal settle. ment is that the climate, though healthy, is occasionl!y hot and dry in summer, the temperature being raised far above what might be expected from the latitude by hot winds (the simoom of Australia) blowing from the great interior desert, which Captain Henderson reminds us of It is consequently a very stimulating climate, and very unfit for the congregating of large masses of men, while the colonists refuse to recoive * single woman; and this primd facie objection is confirmed by a significant answer in the last blue-book on transportation to question 1.574. The presence of a free population is no doubt an advantage, but that this population will increase in any ratio to the influx of prisoners is not very probable, when we see that the colony in 1852,1 after 20 years of existence, numbered only 6,000 souls, and that this very existenoe has been dependent on an annua Parliamentary grant averaging 7,0001. (Gazeur of th6 WVorld, artiole " Western Australia"). A colony which, in spite of so mnch nursing possesses so very feeble and ricketty a constitution must have some great drawback, and that drawback I believe to lie in the fact that the good land is so distant from water carriage as not to be available.
Captain Renderson's computation, that eaoh man sent there has cost in five years only 201 per annum is manifestly a mistake, being based on the supposition that the whole 4,000 convicts had been there for five years, whereas the majority had not been there more than half that length of time, and this, of course, more than doubles the annual expense per man. The plan which I have proposed for the colonization of the Falkland Islands is very different from the pure prison system of Norfolk Island, and it can serve no useful purpose to confound two things so essentially distinct. I am. Sir, your verv obedient servant

Capture Of An Absconded Prisoner.-A Curious
CAPTr OF aN ABSCONDED PRISOiXER.-A CUriOUS case of the reapprehension of a prisoner occurred a few days ago at Torquay, Devonshire. In September, IRO, Mr. Thomas Parrott, a middle-aged man of respectable connexions, and who had been a schoolmaster, was committed for trial on a charge of stealing money from a baker named Coplestone. Parrott, with hs wife and daughter, rented aparments of 51r. Coplestone. Money had been frequently missed from the till in the shop, aad a police offiicer, concealed under the counter, was set to watch. In the zmiddle of the night he detected Parrott, who had come down into the shop m his night drems, in the act of robbing the tilL After his committal bail was accepted ; the prisoner did not appear at the quarter ssions, an the recognizances were forfeited. Lord Courtenay, the chairman, iasued a warrant for his apprehension, but he could not be discovered. Within the past few daTh however, he made his appearance at Torquay, and being identified was taken into custody, and was forthwith committed to the Devon County Prison. The prisoner said he understood that the fact of his bondsmen having paid the amount of his bail rendered him no longer amenable for the offence.

The Supply Of Guano.
I TTE T SUPPLY OF GUANO.
TO THI 3DITOR OF TEM T fÂ§R, ' r
Sir,-Since the untimely and lamented deth of Colonel Blair no member of Parliament hes show aequaI"wzmt. messiz urgingapon thGovernenttfiiort nzo6fio Ing the supply of guano. The acion of Government h':Stlhus become somerwhat apathetic, and, though the Foreign4ffice has continued to show great interest in the matter, andibom anunicate- the result of Its inquiries from time to time to the Royal Agricultural Society, nothing effective has been done. The Peravian monopoly has thus found itelf in undisttib d p06seasion of the market, and is using its advanta to fillitscofferswhile it can. This is now the sixth time that they have so managed s to put the British farmer on a short supply of guano. There is no want of it at the Chincha TIlands, for I learned from a shipmaster who hls recently returned from there that he could disern little appirent diminution from the mass during the interval of several years since his previous visit It is said that Messrs. Gibbi are now taking up an immense tonnage to ecure a larger supply for next year.
They have raised their price from 91, 53. a-ton, at which it stood for several years, to 3.-21. of the rise having been made within the last year. To a man cultivating 50 "cres of green orop, and using 4 owt. of guano an acre, this causes an lncrease of 401. in his annual expenses; it is equivalent to an addition of 4s. an acre to the cost of production bA his farm of 200 acres, and is much the same to him As Ase of 25 per cent, in his rent, or a fresh impost of six tinies' the present amount of his Income-tax. So far as the Peruviau monopolists are concerned we probably cannot help this. They are in pomssesion of the exclusive supply of an article in much demand, and we can hardly blame them for trying to make the most of it.
But we have the greatest possiblo interest in putting an end to this monopoly by encouraging every effort to discover now ganuo deposits. During the war these *fforti were relaxed, or we raight have had by this time a supply ceingby regular shiploads to our shores.
in 1854 Sir James Graham despatched the Juno, Caplin Freemantle, with Captain Ord, who had discovered oerain guano islands on the *oast of Arabia, to examine these islands It is understood that, after ascertaining the value of Captain Ord's discovery, Captain Freemantle applied for and obtained a cession of the islands to Great Britain from the Imaunm of Muscat, who was said to be the Sorereign of them. The British Government recognized that cession by placing the islands under the control of the Colonial-office as British colonial property; and for the purpose of rewarding Captain Ord, the discoverer, they then granted to him and to his partners in the enterprise a licenso for five years to load the guano for English ports, they agreing to pay a crtainroyalty per ton on the quntity imported into this country. On the faith of that licenJe an expedition was fitted out in the summer of lst year; Cap. tain Ord with two ships arrived at the islands in the month of October, and, after landing and commencing operations for the removal of the gnano, he and his party were forced to qnit the islands by a large body of armed Arabs, who denied the right of the Imaum of Muscat to cede the islands, and threatened to shoot the 1e
of the British Government. After Captain Ord's departure with his two ships for Bombay the third ship of the expedition reached the islands, and though the Laptaira did not attempt to land his ship was immediately surrounded bv a great number of armed boats. Many of the people forced themselves on board, and the captain with difficulty escaped by cutting the ropes of the boats and thua getting clear of them. They were evidently pirates, 'who are not lkely to givo up possession of the islands without a show of British authority.
But the people of the first ships were 14 days on one oi the islands before they were interrupted; and, as Iliad lss
week an opportunity of conversing with Mr. Smith, the second in command of the expedition, a man of energy and inteligence, who had loaded guano both at Ichaboe and the Chinchas, I received such information as leaves no doubt on my mind of the great extent and valuo of this guano deposit. He, with about 20 labourers, commenced working the guano at a spot on the Iland of Haski, and, after breaking a crust half an inch in thickness, they dug into pure guano, a depth of six feet, without any sign of change or coming to the bottom, and in a day and a-half turned out about 90 tonsThey were then forced to deist by the Arabs, but the ammoniacal odour was 'so strong that they could scarcely work in the hole which they had made. The whole plain was covered with the deposit, as likewise were two other isiands in the same group. To this Mr. Smith spo'ke from his personal examination, The islands swarm with myriads of seafowl. Samples of the guano are in this oountry, and on analysis prove to be very dry, and much of the same quality as Ichaboe. The quantity estimated to be on these islands is between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 tons.
The islands are situate In Koorya-Morya Bay, on the coast of Arabia, 20 miles from the main land, ten days sail from Aden, and only about six days sail from Bombay. There are 18 fathoms water close in to Haski, and a bay in which 70 vessels might lie with safety. The voyage to England is 20 days shorter than from the Peruvian islands, and a guano trade here would afford most advantageous return freights to English ships from Aden or Bombay. The weather is favourable for shipping the guano during eight months of the year, and the four months of the monsoons might be employed in excavating it on the islands.
Captain Ord and his partners complain that the failure of their expedition has been caused by the indifferenoe of the British Government, and that the pirates of these seas, finding no armed recognition of the right of England, and having discovered that the deposit has a commercial value, are carrying it off to the mainland as quickly as they can. It appears, however, that instructions were sent out by the Colonial-office through the India Board to the Bombay Government, for Captain Ord did not leave Aden with his expedition in September until he had received a letter from the secretary of the Government at Bombay, promisingthat, though they were unable to station a vessel of war at the Koorya-Morya Islands, they would endeavour to arange that avessel should occasionally visit these islands. The war with Persia intervened, no vessel could be spared, and the guano expedition was left to its fate.
Now, without offering a word of animadversion on the Bombay authorities, whose attention to the war was necessarly paramount to everything else, we may hope that if that war is now happily brought to a close they will be ready to redeem their promise. But this matter is really not an Indian, but a British interest. The fact of a valuable and very extensive guano deposit has been ascertained. the islands have become the property of Great Britain by a title which must have been deemed valid by the Government, and it is not too much for the agricultural and shipping interest to expect that the British Government will take immediate measures to assert and maintain their right. If immediate and effective steps ar taken, there is yet time for many shiploads of guano to be imported before the close of the present year.
Here, then, is a ground for definite action on the part of the agricultural interests against the Peruvian monopoly. The discovery of Ichaboe kept down the price of Peruvian guano for many years. A like effect will assuredlyfollow the introduction of extensive supplies from any other quarter. Successive Governments during the last six years have directed their attention to this object, and now that a sour
of supply has been discovered all that is wanted is that it should be secured Oar national agricultural socletie3, having no political organization, cannot act with much effect on the Government, but let the farmers throughout the country tke the matter up in earnest, let them urge it on their representatives in Parliament, and, as it is a question in which all British interests are united, it will soon obtain that degree of attention from Government which it, great importance demands.

TO THE RDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-my attention has this day been drawn to an advertisement in the public papers, signed "George Roatledge and Co.," of " Livingston's Discoveries in Central Africa, with a map, revised by himself." As I have not only had no hand in this work, bat actuallRy know nothing about it, I appeal to you for aid to protect the public from a gross deception, and me from injustice and injury. I am at present busily engaged in preparing a narrative of my travels (to be pu.blished by Mr. Murray), and Mr. John Arrowasmith Is Laying down a map from my observations, so that I hope soon to satisfy public curiosity. I have oertainly given no other person either the information or the authority to justify such an announcement as that of hMessrs Routledgo and Co.; and assuredly no hone6t meu would distort the fact of having pointed out on a faulty map my line of route to friends in private into "' a map revised by himself."

LOND0ZV, SATuBDAY, JANuARY 31, 1857.
At the commencement of active hostilities with a State like Persia it becomes a point of great interest to ascertain the true quality of our antagonists, their general capacity for the operations of war, and the national or popular resources by which our proceedings are likely to be encountered. The immediate object of our expedition to Bushire has been accomplished with a gallantry leaving nothing to desire, and with an amount of judgment which reduced the casualties experienced to a very small loss. Of the viewrs or designs entertained by the enemy we, of course, possess a very imperfect knowledge, but the reports which have reached us from various sources furnish both ample and attractive matter for speculation and remark.
The most remarkable fact is, perhaps, the complicity of the Arab tribes of the vicinity. The troops encountered by our soldiers were not Persians of the SHAH's regular army, but Arab mercenaries, so that the Sepoys met exactly the same kind of enemy against whom they are so frequently led in India, and under circumstances exceedingly similar. Nothing is more commonly reported in our Indian intelligence than the retreat of some company of Arabs, in the service of some native Prince, to a mud fort, or other strong place, which they defend with fanatical desperation. Reshire is a position of this very description, including, besides the fort itself, a cluster of old houses and walled gardens, sprinlded over steep ravines, so that the resistance offered, and the dashing charge required to dislodge the enemy, become very easily understood; indeed, the affair would probably have been much more serious but for the judicious employment of heavy artillery in clearing the way. The next question regards the extent to which the co-operation of these martial tribes may be engaged against us. An envoy, it appears, had been despatched from Teheran to the coast with the express mission of raising the Arabs, but we do not anticipate that the proceeding will be attended with substantial or permanent success. Sir H.NxRY LsEE, indeed, received a visit from one of the chiefs, who proffered the services of his own tribe, and assured the Admiral that all his brethren would prefer the English to the Persians. He even gave such evidence of his sincerity as to communicate a realy valuable piece of information, and we are told that some squadrons of Arab horsemen are likely to be added to our Indian irregulars. As our service wil doubtless be the more profitable of the two, we may, perhaps, count upon their fidelity up to a certain point; but the temper of such auxiliaries is at all times doubtful, and Captain JoNEs, the Resident at Bushire, and PoliticalAgent with the expedition, already informs us that the results of his negotiations with the Arabs for boats of transport, &c., had proved very unsatisfactory, "owing to the impracticability " of dealing with the people in moments of " emergency and need." It may be assumed, however, with some confidence, that such resources will be as much at our command as at that of the SHAH.
Upon a careful scrutiny of the recorded operations of the Persians we find many features of interest, and some which reflect credit upon their military capacity. The reports concerning the preparations made at Bushire seem to have been well founded, for the defences were discovered to
be far stronger than had been supposed. Between 60 and 70 guns of various cahbres were mounted on the batteries, and, it is said, resnectably served, though the absence of casualties on our side argues no great proficiency on the part of their artillerymen. Captain JoNEs, however, remarks that some of their pieces were too light to reach the ships, and he especially mentions the perseverance of the gunners in working their heavier metal when the failure was observed. Nor does it appear that any proper precautions were omitted in their general plan of operations. A force had been stationed in a date I grove to oppose our first landing, but was dis-
persed by recourse to the same arm which insured our success throughout-a well directed artillery. Reshire was garrisoned very strongly, and the Governor of Bushire explained his surrender by gbserving that his preparations for defence had been concentrated on the land side of the town, where he expected the attack. But the movement evincing most ability, ani likely, if successful, to have produced the greatest results,was the project of attacking our dep6t station at Bassadore-a place at the western extremity of the island of Kislim, lying at the mouth of the Gulf. This was the operation of which intelligence was given to Sir HmNPy LEEKE by the Arab Sheik, and the British Admiral surprised accordingly a Persian force said to consist of 3,000 men, "well equipped," at a point of the coast near the island, and dislodged them with his heavy shot and shells. It is expressly mentioned, however, that they made a creditable retreat, and the same fact is recorded of the troops driven from the redoubts outside Bushire, who, says the official despatch, retired to the town " in perfect order and with great cool" ness, supported by their artillery."
One or two incidents serve to mark the halfcivilized character of our antagonists. That our flag of truce should have been fired upon is declared to have been the result of a mistake, and the apology perhaps showed as much; but it is amusing to read in the despatch of the Resident that he had " taken some pains to explain the
meaning of a flag of truce in the event of war"fare before quitting the town." The death, too, of the brave and humane Colonel MALET at the hands of a man whose life he had just saved shows the ideas of war entertained by the Arabs, and it was this circuumstance, no doubt, combined with the loss of Colonel SroPFORD, which impressed our troops with such extraordinary animosity as is described. The resolution adopted by our Commanders of convoying the captured garrison a certain distance into the interior of the country, and then turning them loose, was, probably, a very judicious measure, though not exactly according to the European mode of dealing with prisoners of war. They were too many to feed or guard, and might as well be at liberty as detained to encumber our own operations. It is a remarkable illustration of British dominion that we are now occupying an island in the Persian Gulf by troops in our own service drawn from the population of what was an enemy's country 15 years ago. The battle of Meanee is but an affair of yesterday, and yet the " 2d Beloochees" are spoken of as familiarly as the 2d Light Infantry. The Scinde Horse, too, are expected, under their renowned commander Colonel JAcon; so that, what with the Poonah Irregulars, the Arab levies, and the Sepoy line, our army, if not so countless, will be almost as multifarious as that of XxELxs. That it is admirably harmonized, however, is clear enough from its conduct; nor need it be doubted that the vigour, experience, and talents of General OUTRAB
will maintain the success of an expedition so courageously and skillly commenced.

The Indian news of yesterday communicated an
The Indian news of yesterday communicated an important event to the world. Let nobody smile when we say what that event was, or think we over-estimate it. It was the marriage of the first EHindoo widow. When, in the person of LurHxa, a Catholic priest three centuries ago took to himself a wife, the marriage was not a greater outrage upon the existing religious system of Europe than this first Eindoo widow's marriage is upon the old religion of Eindostan. The last relic of the Suttee system has at length given way to English law, and the* removal of the prohibition of widows to marry has been taken advantage of. Nor has the act been done in a corner, but with considerable pomp and parade, a gathering of Eindoo magnates, and altogether with a look of marked defiance, confidence, and triumph which appears designed to call public attention to the event and to mark its significance. The bridegroom is described as a "I Koolin of Koolins" and " a man of " the very highest sacerdotal rank." The bride, for whom Hindoo religion designed perpetual widow's weeds, has just attained the advanced age of twelve. The union of this grave ecclesiastic with this venerable matron was attended. by " hundreds of Brahmins," who are, of course, prepared to take a similar step themselves when circumstances make it desirable.
Is this the beginning of a Hindoo "Reformation ?" We do not wish to tnrow too high a colour upon such an event, but if it is, we know that it is not the first time that a marriage has been connected with such a great movement, and has ushered it in. Indeed, marriages figure so prominently in history as openings of new eras and new orders of things, they have so often sealed the fates of nations for good or for ill, that a grest marriage has come to be a sort of historical landmark. But however this may be, the marriage of the Pundit GRuEscnuxNDER SuRmA has so far excited Hindoo apprehension that his excommunication is talked of among the native E1igh Church circles of Hindostan. Church and State threaten a collision, and the Eindoo hierarchy incline to rebel against sanctioning what English law permits. It is certainly observable that the subject of marriage is one upon which false religion is remarkably tender. It has particularly applied its efforts to curtailing, restricting, and shaclding this great institution of PROvnDENcE, and its meddling officious temper has particularly selected this great relationship for its experiments. The Manicheans would not alow the " elect" to marry, the Roman Church does not allow the priests to marry, the Hindoo religion does not allow widows to marry. On no subject has the truth of the old Greek proverb, quoted by MONrTAoIN, that " superstition is the child and pupil of conceit," come out more prominently. One might fancy beforehand that a false religion would always err on the indulgent side, that it would always aim at making men comfortable; but it has another aim besides this, and which rather conflicts with it, but of which it is just as proud. It attains one of its great ends if it make man think hinself much purer, loftier, and more spiritual than GOD ever intended he should.. It achieves its principal triumph whea it can persuade mankind that something which is perfectly right and allowable, and which PRovIDE>NcdE intended for their support and consolation, is wrong and not to be done. Its " forbidding" side is quite as necessary to it as its indulgent one. It puffs men up with the idea of abstraction from the senses, and disdain of common virtue and morality, in comparison with certain specific mortifications and gratuitous rejections of the liberty of natural law and conscience. It pretends to do without the benignant side of the Divine economy, as if this side of it were a condescension to poor human nature to which it and its disciples were superior. Oriental religioln is full of this absurd conceit. The Fakir volun-
tarily deprives himself of the use of the arms or legs which GOD gave him, and thiinks this the height of religion, simply because it is a rejection of a gift of PnOVnINCs. The Suttee system arose upon the same principle, and imposed a monstrous act of gratuitous and superfluous selfsacrifice because it had the great merit of being a rejection of the Divine gift of life. The imposition of perpetual widowhood was a relic of the same system. It is the old lesson,-reject Fomething which GOD allows you, and then you are a saint and you will certainly go to Heaven.
The event, then, which the Indian news of yesterday communicated, domestic as it is, is by no means an unimportant one. It is a sign of decided growth in the native mind; it is an act of moral courage, and defiance of the Hindoogods. History and philosophy alike shuw the extreme difficulty with which the human mind snakes off the weight of customary and artificial morality. What people have been taught to think wrong they continue to think wrong; the independent appeal to the light of reason and conscience is the very last act which they perform, and they do it generally with trembling when they do take the step, and half think themselves impious for it. When Hindoo religion, then, has r.aid immemorially that a widow's marriage is wrong, it is a great step when any number of Hindoos say, as they do say now, that a widow's marriage is right. Doubtless many an orthodox Hindoo is seriously grieved and distressed at so audacious an innovation; he feels earth and sky whirling round him, and the ground giving way from under his feet, as he contemplates such an act of impiety; he wonders why the destroyer does not at once crush the delinquents; he sees avenging deities hissing through the throats of the millions of snakes which form their celestial headdress; he sees the multitudinous legs and arms of BRAn)A, VIsMu, and Smv., in angry commotion, their nostrils breathing fire, and their tongues dropping blood; all the shapes of his portentous theology come out, and he dreams of dragons coilng their tails round the universe, and threatening to crush aU nature. But the time is obviously approaching when the orthodox Hindoo must retire to his cell, and groan in solitude over the degeneracy of modern piety and growth of religious laxity. When people once begin to alter their moral standard they generally go on. The difficulty lies in the first step, the first act of independent appeal to natural reason and law. When this act has been once done the human mind feels its strength, and moves more freely after it. We have been told, indeed, over and over again of the immovableness of the Hindoo mind, and how impos sible it is to put a new idea into it, but the fact now confutes these judges. It was, however, quite absurd even beforehand to settle the question so summarily against the Hindoo. How in the world could we know what his mind was, or what there was in it, so long as it was kept down by the weight of a colossal superstition, and so long as we did nothing at all to relieve it from that weight ? What possible right had we to say that the Hindoo was incapable of progress, when we ourselves stopped up the way ? But these recent facts, at any rate, refute this idea. It now appears that the English Government of India have been more orthodox Hindoos than the Brahmins themselves, and have, in their dread of offending the native prejudices, been actually keeping them up artificially when of themselves they were ready to yield. But this has been the consequence of that exclusively mercantile basis on which India has been hitherto held. How could we legislate well for India when we did not even pretend tnat our aim as possessors of India was the good of India? Improve this ground and motive and we shall see the Hlindoo with different eyes. We shall see abundant reason to hope where at present we despair. India will afford a field to the zeal of the philanthropist which it has not had since the abolition of the slave trade ; and the improvement of that great empire and the progress of that multitudinous race will elicit and employ the benevolent energies of years.

The title of journalists to publish reports of
The title of journalists to publish reports of public meetings must be set at rest. Either Westminster-hall or Parliament must review and settle the question. It cannot be suffered to remain in the doubtful position in which the hasty decision of " IAvisox v. DuNcA" has just placed it.
When Lord CANPBELL, during the conversation which preceded the judgment, asked, "Was this "a meeting at which the public had a right to "be present?" and added, " a good deal might "depend on that," he had, with characteristic sagacity, seized upon the real point of the case. 'Unfortunately he let it go again. When he came to deliver the judgment of the Court he had confused himself with certain of the rusty fictions which still lie about Westminster-hall, and he talked like JoiN- DOE and RiCEHARD RON in an old action of ejectment. In truth, the situation was an embarrassing one. The Court of Queen's Bench had not the courage to sweep away the half adverse precedents of evil times, and to go back to the old common law of England, which punished the inventor and not the repeater-they had not the courage to say that the celebrated resolution in Lord NoRTirAuIPTON'S case is stiUl law, and to clear that great legal landmark of the rust and barnacles which little men and later times have suffered to adhere to it.
Therefore was it necessary to cover a bad decision with bad reasons. We have dealt with the law of the case upon aformer occasion. The reasons, however, are worthy of some further observation. We are not about to discuss lengthily the often-repeated fiction of the allabsorbmg interest which the public have in reading reports of trials rather than reports of any other proceedings. No doubt, the Lord Chief Justice in this rather repeated what he found other judges had said than what he had deliberately considered. Lord CAMPBELL, when he does consider the origin of this exception, will confess that it must have been introduced by the judges, not for the benefit of the public, but for their own convenience, in that it protected their own reports. It was not for .the public, but for " DuRa?" FORD and EAsV' and their voluminous descendants, that this exemption was invented. When the old common law rule, as laid down by eleven English judges in the time of Sir EDWARD CoKE, was abrogated, the convenience of the Courts required this exception, and it was made. We hope to hear no more of this " public conveni" ence," unless the judges are disposed to deal honestly with it as a principle, and to extend it to all cases where this exigence exists.
The only reason for this judgment which deserves any real attention is rather legislatorial than legal. The judges say that no privilege to publish the proceedings of a public meeting exists, because they think it ought not to ex:st, and they think it ought not to exist because, if it did, " a "fair account might be published of what took "place at a public meeting, whatever injury it "might do to private character." Now, any worthy citizen who happened to be in court, and heard the Lord Chief Justice of England talming thus carefully and tenderly of private character, would naturally conclude that he lived under laws which shielded his reputation and punished any. man who might defame him.
Nothing can be more unfounded. Private charactemr are no more protected by the English law than polecats. If your words should injure a man's poeket or threaten his liberty the law will interfere, but in other respects character is fair game to all speakers, either in public or private. Calumnies so gross that they would make a Quaker take the utterer by the throat are innocent in the ear of a British judge.
Are you a malignant man and much a coward, fond of revenge, yet loth to pay for it ; and do you hate your neighbours on the right and on the left? Go to your parish vestry, or to your club, and exert your legal privileges. Your right-hand neighbour happens, as you know, to be a religious and moral man, who shames you by his virtuous life, and who places aU his happiness in his domestic relations. Get up in your place in the vestry and relate your sorrows, in that you have the misfortune to live next to a man who is in the habitual commission of adultery and whose daughter is-you may use the foulest word the English language has for a woman,the law wriU justify you. Of your left-hand neighbour you may say that he is a forsworn man, and, if you do not live in the city of London, you may add that he is "a " cuckoldy old rogue." No one shaU molest you. The police, if you shaU find it necessary to require their aid, shaU be bound to keep the peace while you deliver yourself of these accusations. If any one should be so ill-advised as to seek any remedy at law, the Court wiU protect you. The very judges who were so terrified at the danger likely to arise to private character shaU turn your assailant out of court and make him pay your costs of defending yourself. If you should feel your vindictiveness whetted by anything that may have faUen from the husband in his indignation, or the father in his wrath, or from the daughter il her despair, call a meeting at the Freemasons' or the London Tavern under some other pretence, and, when thousands are, assembled, introduce the anecdotes, with names and circumstances, as an ilustration of your speech. It is for you to consider whether you will wound deeper by inventing what is false or revealing what is trne. It is alike in the eye of the law. True or false, Lord CAmrPBLL wil be bound to throw over you the protection of the judicial ermine. As a man he will no doubt think unkindly of you and speak harshly to you, but as a judge he will allow you to take out execution for your costs and lock up both your neighbours, if they should happen not to be able to pay you.
This is the law of England, and it is to preserve this law that the judges throw upon the press the burden of being the guardians of private character. It is we who are to weigh the expressions as they fall; it is we who, at our own peril, are to decide whether aug't that has been said is likely to move hatred or contempt against any other person. And then, when al has been done,-when the report has been carefully screened clear of every personal allusion, when every accusation-rightly or wrongly made-has been Ecrupulously excerpted, qsome local circumstance may possibly give a libellous character to some innocent sentence, and an " inuendo" in the declaration will make the connexion complete and the damages sure.
But, if the press is silent, is private character therefore secure ? In our days reputation stands side by side with hoDour. Character is a more delicate thing than it was with the sturdy middle class of bygone days. A slander may have worked its end, and its victim may be walking abroad among his fellows unconscious that the plague-spot is upon him. A malicious word may do more certain wrong than a.lie graven on the base of a column. If a man be an honourable man he would wish that if an imputation be made against him it should not be whispered in a corner, or passed along from mouth to ear, but made publicly and in print, where he could recognize it and destroy it. Surely the judges, for the sake of the dignity of their office and of the law they administer, wiU seek to obtain an alteration in our defamation law as now administered ? It cannot be their pleasure to sit as judges without power to punish the most odious crimes which man can commit against his fellow. Some change there must be. The changes we ask for are these,-
Abolish the distinction between wrords publicly and advisedly spoken and the same words when written.
Permit a defendant to plead that the words complained of were really spoken by the person named in the report; that the requisite evidence to prove this fact had been placed at the disposal of the plaintiff, and that the publication was without malice.
With a law thus amended the Court of Queen's Bench may speak gravely of the protection accorded by the law to private character. They have no right to do so as long as they are obliged to admit that they can give no remedy against the slanderer of a neighbour's morals or the calumniator of a woman's chastity.

Some twelve months since we felt it our duty
Some twelve months since we felt it our duty to lay before the public such particulars as had reached us of the behaviour of the British Ambassador at Constantinople towards General WILLIAMS in the transactions which led to the memorable defence of Kars, and debates followed which even now, on the eve of another session, are scarcely forgotten. We are not again about to demand justice on the Ambassador. This time the affair has in it a little of the comic. There are no serious interests involved, and the object of the Ambassadorial ire is no struggling and isolated soldier, but a cool old brother diplomatist, who has served in aU latitudes and in both hemispheres, and is quite able to take care of himself. After Madrid and Washingtonthose two poles of the political world-Sir HENBY BuLwEx is not likely to be inflamed by opposition or chilled by neglect in any capital where his functions may call him. He seems to have had much the better of his imperious colleague in the little scene which was described a few days since, and which is said to engage the attention of the Levantine world, to the exclusion even of railway concessions and the bankruptcy of the Harem. It appears that the Ambassadors of the Great Powers, though they seldom agree in anything, have agreed to be jealous of the Commissioners whom their respective Governments have sent to regulate the Danubian Principalities. It may be well imagined that where the placid THOTJVEiSEL and the cautious PROKESCI have shown signs of fretfulness, the fiery spirit of Lord STRATFORD DE REDCL;FFE would burst into a flame. Sir HxaRY Bui-vzW landed only to find himself under the ban of Therapia. Sparta or Siam may have their two kings, but let not a second British representative attempt to share the throne from which Lord STn,,ATFORD has awed Constantinople and the world so many years. The Ambassador would not communicate with the presumptuous intruder. The Government had sent out orders that Sir H. BULWER should be furnished witlh full information on all subjects connectedwith tho Principalities, but, in spite of the repeated requests of the Commissioner, Lord STRATFORD resolutely kept back every paper which the Embassy wrote or received. Sir H&NSRY never saw a word of the correspondence from Jassy or Buchest, and as to the official documents of the TvAish Govemlnent, or the details
of the Conference, lhe had to depend for his knowledge of them on the good nature of his brother Commissioners. TheCommissioner remonstrated, but in vain. Such was the state of things when the day arrived for the mixed Conference between Amnbamadors and Commissioners. According to the instructions sent out by the English Government, SFir H. BULWER was to receive on this occasion fulU expiknations of all that had been done; he was to be allowed to make observations and propose amendments. Raving been kept quite in the da'k up to this time, he resolved to make use of the powers accorded to him. So, when the day for the mixed Conference came, and its members were seated, Sir IEa-xV politely requested information as to whlat had passed, declaring that his instructions were to make himself acquainted with the progress of the matter in hand. Lord STRATFOnD rose in a storm ; he did not come, he said, to enter into personal questions, and if Sir HxnfrY BULV;ER continued he should take his hat and leave the room. The scene that folowaed is described as ludicrous, though painful. The ungovernable fury of the Ambassador, his look, his gestures, his angry tones, his indecorous expressions, were Buch as have never been seen in 6ur own 'ines in a diplomatic or even a popuar assembly. Sir H. BULWEB sat calm and ollected, still further aggravating his opponent by his polite and cutting replies. The Coinmissioner was in the right, and heo' w it, for he had the positive instructions of his Gove6nment in his pocket, and of those instructions lie Lnew that Lord STRATFOPD had a copy. So 'he let the storm rage on. The Turks were much embarrassed. They had had nearly 50 years' experience of the Ambassador, but had never seen anything like this. The other representatives, we can well fancy, were delighted at the display, for there is little affection between these personages at any time, and they aU unite in hearty jealousy of the irritable Ambassador. However, one or two of the number politely rose to calm the discord, and SooII after the Conference adjourned, having come to no decision, as has been the not unfrequent practice of Conferences in aU ages.
The scandal of this incident is of course great. At every legation, in every foreign coterie, it has been discussed with the glee which is always shown when anything arises to the discredit of England. But it does not seem that there is much harm done. ALP1OsxBE may assure ALOIDE that the perfidious policy of England has received a deathblow by the dissension of her two diplomatists, but matters wiU probably go on pretty much as if they had been on the most affectionate terms. In fact, the Government seems to have been wrong in sending out a man so highly placed as Sir H. BULwER as adlatu., to Lord STRATFORD. It might have been foreseen that they would quarrel. With respect to the imperious diplomatist of Constantinople the world has no need of further information. We all know what he is. Energetic, incorruptible, and patriotic, he has fought the battle of Turkey and England for years upon years against all sorts of enemies. Whether the foe be an army of Russians on the Danube or a cabal of greedy self-seekers at the Porte, Lord STRATFORD has been on the alert, waging hot war against them, threatening, scolding, coaxing, forming coalitions, and planning coups d'etat until he gains his point. In the main his purpose has been a good one, and his success has been a benefit to Turkey and the world. But certainly the amenities of personal intercourse have not come within the number of his studies. The man has yet to be born who can conciliate that irritable and suspicious disposition when it has once thought fit to consider him as a rival. We have no doubt that Lord STRATFORD's views concerning the Danubian Principalities are farsighted and clear, that he is engaged in urging with all the restless energy of his characte.' the opinions lie has formed, that he knows more about the subject than Sir H. BL-LwER can ever hope to learn, and that the whole affair would be safer in his hands than in the Commissioner's. But we have as little doubt that the moment he heard Sir H. BULwER'S name aU the STRATFORD was roused witlin him. If it had been some undistinguished Honourable from Stockholm or Florence all would have been well; but to have a Einister like himself-a Grand Cross of the Bath-a man who had signed treaties and had an European reputation-was too much. Unless he showed his undisputed supremacy, what would Pera, what would his attaches, what would his cavasses think? So farewell all thoughts of national dignity or private courtesy. Re will not bear the presumption of that man or any other who trespasses on his prescriptive domain. All we can say is that we hope the affair may be speedily and permanently settled, and if Lord STRATFORD can restore the Principalities to a system of good govermment we think the world may as well forget the escapade which is the result of a temper which it is now too late to correct.

The Annual Reform Meeting At Manchester.
THE ANNVUAL REFQRf MEETIYG( Ar I MfANCRESTER.
A brief telegraphic account of the proceedings at this meeting, hold in the Free Trade-hall on Thursday evening, appeared in The Tima of yesterday. The subjoined is va extended report of the speeches.
MIr. GEOROX WILSON, who presided and was greeted with loud applause, referred with great regret to the unavoidable absence of Mr. Bright. In lieu of the thrilling eloquence of that gentleman it would he his (the chairman's) duty to read a communication in which Mr. Bright asked whether, under all the circumstances of the case, the public require. ments of the borough of Manchester called on the electors, during his temporary absence, to supply his place by another representative. (" No, no !") No advice had been tendered to Mr. Bright on this subject; and no man had been communicated with, directly or indirectly, as to the vote which he might givo that night. With the exception of a few influential mlembers of the committee the letter had
no' been shown to anybody. It was in the old Free-tradehaMl, at the solicitation of 4,000 or 5,000 people, that Mr. Bright was first asked to allow himself to be put in nomination for Manclhester, and Mr. Bright now called upon them, in the new Free-trade-hall, to decide whether he should longer remain their representative. From the first day when Mr. Bright came before the public he resolved to dedicate himself to the public service, and he had connected himself with measures which owed, perhaps, more to him than te any other man'in the country. (Hear, hear.) It was his (thechairmnan's) good fortunetostand beside Mr.Bright when he was returned for the city of Durham ; and there never was an election more honourable to a constituency and a candidate than the one in question. He saw in the maeAet place of that city 20,000 or 30,000 people hold up their bands, with not six exceptions, at the nomination, in favour of Mr. Bright. He saw more than that, which convinced him that in England genuine and honest sentiment, accompanied by great ability, would win their way wherever they were placed before the public; he sar in that, city, with its great cathedral, its enormous hierarchy, its great clergy powrer, he saw the Dean of Durham and others of the clergy walk up to the polling-booth and vote for hIr. Bright, a Dissenter, wihose views on the connexion of Church and State were not hid in a corner. (Hear, hear.) At the solicitation of the burgesses of Manchester he became member for that city, and no man would say-to usea Manchesterphrase-that biscolours had everbeen anythingbut"fast ones. ' Mr. Bright always voted strictly in accordance with the principles which he had professed, and would not, to curry favour with any man on the face of the earth, deviate one hair's-breadth from the strict line of duty which he had laid down for his guidance, nor betray one honourable principle to which he had pledged himself to the eleotors of Manchester. (Hear, Eear.) He (the chairman) did not hesitate to saY now, for the first time, that during the last three or fomr years fr. Bright had formed one of the great historical figures of the age; and that when men came to review his speeches and conduct, whether as regarded the game laws (applause), the distress of the Irish (applause), or the misgovernment of India (applause), they would agree with him that, among all the ustrious men-and there were now illustrious men of aU parties in the House of Commons-there was no man stood greater, or would stand reater, than their absent member. (Prolonged applause. For some years before the Russian war there were two questions occupying public attention,-the financial arrangements of the country, ably brought forward by the financial reformers of liverpool, Edinburgh, and Manchester,-and that of our representation, which occupied the attention of Lord John Russell; and, whatever necessity there was for gving attention to them then, it was tenfold greater now. Up to the end of last March the expenditure of the country amounted to the enormous sum of 93,000,O001. for the year, -a sun so large that it was a wonder how It had been expended; but the effects of that expenditure we saw in the tenantless houses and the zecent meetings in the metropolis. That sum represented the annualexports of the country for the same year, which amounted to 95,000,0001.- so that the expenditure amounted to within two mUlions of the declared value of the exports, notwithstanding the capital employed in our manufactures, the energy of our workpeople, and the capabilities of our manufacturers and merchants. The Chancellor of the Exchequer last year endeavoured to relieve our apprehensions by showing us that this expenditure only amounted to 65s. per head, which amounted, on the average as to families, to something like 171. to 181. for each family. The population of Lancashire at tho last census being more than 2,031,000, the taxation which Lancashire bore amounted, therefore, to 6,700,0001., or within 1,000,0001.-of the whole annual rateable value of the pro in that county. And the Chancellor of the xchequer, so careful was he that this should not appear oppressive in the eyes of the public, positively took in the increased population since the census of 1851, including every pauper in the country, and all those who received the taxes of the State. But the average being 171. IOs. for each family according to the Chancellor, while it was 201. according to his (the chairman's) estimate, they might fairly consider whether, having to calculate often for the edueation of their children, the relief of the necessitous around them, and what was necessary to preserve their sons from crime or their daughters from something worse (hear), whether there was anything which pressed more directly at present on the industry of the country than the enormous taxation to which we have been subjected. (Cheers.) But the Chancellor's object in giving these figures was to show that our taxation was not veryn much in excess of the taxation of France. Now, the taxation of France for the same year was about 37s. 7d., while ours was 65s. The taxation of France, exclusive of the debt, was about 28s. for the war, against our 45s. And, as we knew, the French did
en much as we did-at all events, claimed more credi# from the result than we did-end spared neither money nor troops, we were bound to ask whether the Executive of this country had managed their affairs as they ought to have done' Otherwise, why should not our taxation, for the declared purposes of the war only, have been limited to the expenditure which took place in France? There was justnow great impatience of this taxation, as was shown by the meetings throughout the country for the purpose of getting rid of the income-tax. He would never say a word in favour of that tax on the labour of the country. He had seen the great objections applying to any honest man being compelled to produce his books and reveal his affairs before commissioners who had no right to inmuire into them (applause), but he, nevertheles, believe that a tax upon property was a legitimate tax to be levied in this country, (Hear, hear.) The opponents of the income-tax were putting the cart before the horse in not first ascertaining what should be the expenditure for the future, rather than attacking one tax, the shifting of which might throw burdens on other classes. (Applause.) From 1842 to the commencement of thewarexcept during the Irish famine, when we properly made a large contribution in aid of the Irish-every Chancellor of the Exchequer had a large surplus with which to relieve productive industry. The first thing to be done, then, was to bring our expenditure down to 50,000,0001. or 51, 0,0001., which it was from 1843 to 1854, in order that, by a concentration of energy, we might throw off burdens that were mostMoppressive. (Applause.) It might be said that this was cult; but, instead of going to the standard at which the financial reformers expected to arrive, they had been content to adopt the standard fixed by successive Chancellors preceding the war. In Prussia-which had been much abused for not interfering during the war-the whole taxation, according to our own Chancellor of the Exchequer, was only INs. 3d. a-head on the popula. tion; and surely no one could complain that the English were disposed to resist taxation, when they calmly proposed to pay for the next year twice as much a-head as was paid in Prussia. (Hear, hear.) No doubt we should hear that the Government had entered into engagements which precluded their making those reductions at the close of the war. The peace was concluded in March last year, and a great peace demonstration took place in the succeeding
y. The Government could not have given that demonstration unless it had been an accredited and positive fact that we had had peace, and that from that day they were determined to reduce the expenses of the country to the amount absolutely required in tines of peace. And when he mentioned that from the time of the ast peace, im addition to the ordinary 28,000,0001. per

(Applause.) It was clear that important matters would have to be discussed during the next session of Parliament. During the past yetar u e had very nearly been cong aed in a war with our brethren in the United States, and h ad recently got involved in war with Persia and China. He would not express an opinion on the merits or demerits of these wars, but he regretted that the constitution of this country allowed the people to be startled every post by rumours that they might be at war with almost every nation in the world; that some provision was not made by which the representatives of the people should have been convened specialy (hear, hear), in order that their sanction might have been given to hostilities of which no man could see the end. He did not believe that this country could be raised in the eyes of the world by warlikle demonstrations. (Hear, hear.) He would rather take such steps that the English name, instead of carrying terror, might be synonymous with forbearance and justice wherever it was known. He would prefer paying such attention to our domestic institutions that they might be improved, and he would invite a larger proportion of the industrial classes to take their share by vote and voice in the management of the affairs of the country, so that it should be said to al nations that whenever the House of Commons came to its decisions it contained the result of the opinion of the people of England. ("Hear, hear," and applause.) It might be considered selfish, but he would begin at home, trying by steady and gradual progress, and by a well-organized and systematic effort, to produce in England such a state of political, social, and moran independence of the peo le as should supply an example to the world. (Applause. He concluded by reading the letter from hir. Brght, and moving the resolution of sympathy with, and confidence inz that gentleman, containded in the report which appearedi in 27rc Times of yes-

that gentlenman were among us at the present time there were peculiar services which he would render to his country and to the people of England. In Norwich, there had been some extraordinary proceedings connected with alleged poachings, and would not that gentleman's voice have extended thither ? Would he have permitted a noble lord to have occupied a place on the bench, as judge, as PIT, and as advocate too, witbout a thri3llinP ppeal bein' ma e to the people of this country, on behalf of injured Justice, and denouncing, as he would, the de2radation of the judgment seat in that cse4 (Cheers$, But they were yet surroun*sd by good, ien and true, and in the approachi g ession of l'a'dnaoent ths were great ei, la-
portant duties to be perfozmed. If he (Mr. Bazley) might be permitted, he would -ay, let them 0begin aome retorms at home. They had their neighbours at Liverpool taxng them for duties and services which they did not render. They were erecting those palatial structures which reared their proud beads above themand very cheaply too-at the expense of the county, and not at the cost of their own pockets. (Laughter.) Even the police force of Liverpool was sastained at the expense of the traf1ic of the country, and the Legislature was fairly called upon to afford redress and to levy equal taxation. But in all probability the great duties that would devolve upon our representatives, during the next session, would be to claim the economical expenditure of the taxes, and to avert, if possible, impending wars. (Hear, hear.) What had Persia done, that, like some monster boa-constrictor, we should attempt to swallow her? (Applause.) Then, there was the com.paratively harmless and guiltless China (hear, hear), that we were treating, he feared, neither with humanity nor justice. (Applause.) Had we not invaded the moral laws and regulations of that country by forcing the poison of opium upon the people? (Hear, hear.) Had we set an example of either commercial or political morality to the Chinese? No! The war, he apprehended, could not be defended upon any known principle of equity; and our legislators would be called upon to demand the reason why such an extraordinary proceeding had been sanctioned by the representatives of the British Government. Among our multitude of admirals we had had one too many in the China seas. ("H ear, hear," and laughter.) Wo required a general system of education, for notinug but superior intelligence on the part of the people could keep in check the misdoings of our rulers. (Applause.) There was much to do in connexion with our colonies. The great industry of this district feared a famine of its raw material; and yet our possessions in the East and the West Indies could supplyall we wanted if they were governed wisely and wel. (Applause.) We were guilty in onr foreign policy of a lamentable degree of intermeddling (applau), but he hoped that brighter days were before us, and to see our Govemment respecting the rights of other countries, and carrying out those reforms which alone, under Providence, could sustain the loyalty, safety, and greatness of this country. (Applause.)
The motion was carried unanimously, with "three cheers for Bright," the audience rising.
The Right Hon. T. M. GrnsoN was greeted with loud cheering. He said that, although the last resolution had been passed, he hoped he might be permitted to pay his tribute of respect to his absent colleague. (Hear, hear.) He esteemed Mr. Bright as a private friend; he had cordiaUy co-operated with him in the discharge of his public duties, and there was nobody who would feel his loss more than he (AMr. Gibson) should in the House of Commons. Whatever might be the opinion of Mr. Bright's constituents as to his merits, there was a stil more unanimous conviction in that house, where all parties bore testimony to the eloquence, the ability, and the courage which he had displayedqualities in which he had few rivals, and none who excelled him in that assembly. (Applause.) Before reading tne resolution which had been placed in his hands, he (Mr. Gibson) would mako a few observations which he considered appropriate to the occasion. A few days since he received a letter from Lord Palmerston, Informing him that Parliament would meet on the 3d of Feb. ruary, and e arnestly requesting his attendance, as " mat. tens of great importancev would be immediately brought before the House of Commons." He hoped It was not too much to expect that now the war on the continent was concluded the Government of England might be able to attend to the affairs of England. (Applause.) When Parliament met they would find parties in a somewhat disorganized state. There were the Governm ent, the Opposition, and the outsiders. Perhaps it was not proper to speak of outsiders, as it had been the practice to consider only two parties, the Government and the Opposition-Whigs and Tories; *bt now there were outsiders, men of great experience and ability, Lord John Russell and the colleagues of that distinguished statesman the late Sir Robert PeeL But to use a sporting phrase, an "outsider" sometimes won. ('Hear, hear," and laughter.) With regard to the Government they had been told that great advantage had been derived from the exclusion from office of the colleagues of the late Sir Robert Peel; it was said, when the Coalition Government had been patched up, that although there was great individual talent in the administration there was a want of common principles among them-that they were a house divided against itself, and could not administer public affairs with vigour and success. The friends of the late Sir Robert Peel bad been excluded, a great deal of talent had been removed from the Administration, but had they succeeded in procuring that unitv of opinion which it was said was ao desirable? He was afraid t at although they had lost the administrative talent the house was still divided against itself. He beieved the members of the present Government to be recpectable men, of fair average capacity, but of very doubtfal politics. (Hear, hear.) They had laly seen its chief among them (;ear," and laughter), and had had an opportunity in some measure of judging for themselves. Members were frequently blamed in the House of Commons for not supporting the Government, but if it were true that the Government did not support itself did they deserve that reproach ? He undertoole during the last session the management of a measure, affecting, no doubt, but a small portion of the people of this cotatry, but involving the very fundamental princi. ples of relBgious liberty, namely, that men should not be excluded from their cvil rights on account of their religious opinions (hear, hear), and he found that the members of the Government in the House of Commons supported it, and a Cabinet Minister in the House of Lords, where a vote was much more wanted, gave his vote in opposition. So, upon a fundamental question of religious liberty, they had members of Her Majesty's Administration unable to agree among themselves, and giving conflicting votes in thetwo Houses. Could it be vondes, then, that the member for a great constituency, bound to support broad, liberal, and enlightened principles, could not give full support and confidence to such an Administration ? (Applause. The were not agreed upon the question of vote by alot. le would much sooner have an Administration that would oppose it, so that they should not have the question shelved, but fairly argued, than have an Administration divided upon it, which thus retained members who advocated it in their consciences, but were unable to ive it their public support, because they belonged to a Ministr
whose chief waS opposed to it. The authority of a united Cabinet upon all great quetions of public polity appeared necessary and essentia for the sucoessful carrying on of public affairs. To predict what might be the measures of the coming session was somewhat difficult. The Queen's Speech, which was, perhaps, now being concoctedwith the vew of putting upon paper a set of words which should conyey as little dennite meaning as possible, might contain some attractive announcement; but there was such a thing as making flattering announcements and not fulfilling them. As a witness once said in a committee of the House of Commons, thatin consequence of the pressure on the means of subsistence families in affluent circumnstances in Clapham had placed wine bottles on the tables at their entertainments with the tacit understanding that the wine was not to be tasted, so measures were often announced in the Queen's speech, with the tacit understanding that they were not to be carried. (' Hear, hear," and laughter.) It was announced in the last Queen's speech that it was intended to deal with the question of the Liverpool town dues; but the intention, unfortunately, was not carried out. Some time ago they repealed the navigation laws - it was promised to
e shipping interest of the country that all local burdens upon ships that could be dealt with should be taken off, in order to enable them the better to meet the competition they would have to encounter if those laws were repealed. A commission was appoixted to inquire into all these local duties throughout the whole country. Ample evidence was taken, full information was supplied to the Government - and the commision, in its inquiry at Liverpool, discovered that the corporation of that townu had been in the habit of levying tolls UpOn ships, and goods'carried in ships, and applying those funds, not to commercial or shig,Ang purposes, but to the municipal expenditure of their borough, which expenditusre in all other towfns was defrayed out of local rates. (Hear, hear.) That discovery, if so it might be called-for discovery it undoubtedlywas nottothepeople of this district, though probably it was to the pople generally of England-had naturlly led to a great desnre that such an abuse should be put an end to. Those who advocated the application of these tols to shippin
and commercial purposes, as they were levied en ships and goods carried in ships, were accused of somethig that sounded very bad. They ,were accueed of beingreadyto confiscate private property, and of being indifferent to moral considerations of private rights. Why, the question of pri
vato property did not arise in a matter of tiis sort; these were tolls levied by a great public body, the corporation of Liverpool, and held in trust by them for public purposes; and it was competent for the Parliament of the country to deal with these tolls and taxes as they would with other tolls and taxes, and to make such arrangements as they thought best for the public interests. (Cheers.) He had been told that an original grant of Charles 1. entitled the Livercool corporation to levy these taxes, and apply them to the purposes of the householders of LiverpooL. Well, he (MIr. Gibson) said that Charles L could not give what Charles I. never had (hear, hear) * for he believed Charles I, never had vestd in him the right of levying taxes and tolls
for any otner purpose than giving a correspondent equivalent to those who paid them, m the discharge of some public duties that were necessary. (Hear, hear.) And if there was vested in Charles I. the power of levying tolls upon ships that entered the Mersey, it was because there was an ouligation upon Charles I. to keep in order also the harbour of Liverpool and to ex end the moneyin improvinz the navigation so as to benefit the trade of the country.f he gave away or sold the tolls, he also imposed on those who took them the obli tions he was under when he received them himself, and tnerefore there was no question of injus. tice or of confiscation; it was merely a question of applying public taxes to their original purposes and correcting a misappropriation of public money, caused by lapse of time, and perhaps neglect of Parliament. He would endeavour to exert himself with all the energy and ability he possessed in order to get this great abuse set right. (Applause.) It was aid that when the Government submitted their measure they were not supported by the members for Manchester and the manufacturing districts. A more groundless assertion was never uttered. (Applause.) The bill was before the House for second reading; had the debate proceeded those members would have dealt with the arguments of opponents, but in the midst of the debate, without notice, Lord Palmerston did what was almost without precedent-he abazdoned a measure under discussicn, and of which the second reading had been moved. They (the members referred to) were not prepared for that result; and consequently it might appear to the world that they did not take the fitting opportunity to support the measure. He knew why it was withdrawn. There was a certain gentlkman connected with a political party called a "whipper-in." (Laughter.) That gentleman counted votes; he told Lord Palmerston that be did not like the look of tie division upon the Local Dues Bill; and then, said Load Plm>erston, 'We'll unm no risks. Let's abandon it1 amI.hssa a qommiuiÂ±~ tf in3uiry. We'll send thenm into
a rcom upstairs, and we shall hear no more-of them for the ri st of the seaman." (Laughter.) But, although when appointed the committee did not appear necessary, it had caused a great deal of valuable information to be obtained. The Town Clerk of Mancbester (applause), Mr. Alderman Bancroft, and Mr. Ashworth, had given such telling evidence that its circulation mnst tend to produce a public opiuion, and a decided public interest, in behalf of the measure whenever it mnight next be introduced. (Hear, hear.) He would not travel over the well trodden ground of the policy which led to the late Russian war. The sooner we dimnissed that war from our minds, abandoned our policy of suspicion, and began to cultivate friendly relations with Russia, the better, in his conscience he believed, it would be for the interests of the people of England. (Applause.) He -was one of those who were considered not sufficiently fond of war. ("Hear, hear," and laughter.) He had always wondered that that could be held to be a reproach to a member representing a great commercial constituency. He bad always been of opinion that the RussiaAn war might have been avoided (hear, hear); and if he were now to draw out a debtor and creditor account, to put on one side the vast expenditure of life and treasure, and, on the other side, the proceeds of the war, he feared such a balance-sheet would present but a very sorry aspect. He hoped it might never be his duty to endeavour to make a defence for that war; for he conscientiously told them that, opposed as he was to its policy, be was still more doubtful as to the advantages to mankind of its results. (Applause.) He was aware that on this question he differed from many men whom he highly respected; and he felt that he ought to do so with hesitation, seeing the men who had expressed strong opinions on the other side. Yet if he looked to authority as to the results of the Russian war he felt most completely perplexed. He found some telling us that the result bad been glorious while others declAred that it had been disgraceful. A large portion of the English press assured us that the termination had not ref'ected credit upon England, while another wortion told us that we had covered ourselves with glory.
e had never been able to make out the result with anY certainty, except it was increased expenditure and increased taxation. (Hear, hear.) A grsatd was to have been done for liberty, but the friends of liberty had been disappointed in the results of the war. He owned he was never sanguine that that cause would be promoted by the operations in the Crimea; he never could understand how,
by any possible contingency, any one human being in the universe could be a more free man after that expedition was over than he was before. (Hear, hear.) The fnends of liberty had expected otherwise, and they were now. disappointed. The fault he found with them was, not that thev had entertained those generous aspirations and wishes, but that they assented to the war upon the ground that something was to be done for liberty, without having the slightest guarantee that their views and policy would be carried out. And now his hon. friend the member for Oldham had con. fessed to his constituents that he was disappointed with the results of the war, that nothing had been done for European freedom. (Hear, hear.) The friends of democratic policy vwho supported that war seemed to him (Mr. Gibson) not so alive to their interests as the supporters of the aristocratic policy who promoted the war. A pamphlet had recently been published by a gentleman who might be caled a confi dant of the Foreign-office, and undoubtedly it was published w ith the sanction of the British Foreign-office; he would read an extract from it:-
"Along pace with all itableuin cardiea with It Ome evils. as a
boag war with all its misery brlugs with it some good. The evil of the long peace was that an unbealthy desiro for innovation was being engendereda men were lefected with a morbid desire to mount up to
firsa princpieg and tO pry lirto the hidden reoeaws of the consitution.
IlAusiter.) The Peace Boctyw va another morbid symptom. amorai
onetro,ity. indicative to the careful diagnosis of tbe Stato physician that disae w{as lurking somewrhere in this get body^, which se,emed
evil ofthe war Is, that atheOlltheshemTesA of adAtibea chang wereA^ post
pvned; that, anxious for the vigorens prosecution andA final uces of the contest, the molt extreme oftho Reformers were desirous of potting aside their darling project."
t had been wel said that war was the art of conquering at home, diverting the public mind from their own affairs. (Applause.) By busyig them with the quarrels of foreign nations they increased the revenue andpower ofthe governing classes, deteriorated the condition of the great mAqsee, and threw back progress and reform of every kind. War was a game that princes had always played at when it had been necessary to check reform. (Hear, hear.) But, although in this country It was not a guestion concerning the monarchy, it concerned the putting off of radical reforms in the representation which were "looming in the distance;" and in France it undoubtedly was a question of giving strength, at the time the war commenced, to the ruler of that country. (Hear.) He thought the meeting before him would say that, now the war was over, the sooner they began to dive into the "receases of the constitution" and attended to matters of reform the better. Lord J. Russell abandoned his reform biU with tears in his eyes; he hoped he had come back from Florence with a new reform biU m his pocket (hear, hear), to test his strength against Lord Palmerston and the antiReformers. The report had been circulated that Lord Palmerston had a reform bill ready; but it was not probable, for he left Lord John's Administrationibecause he would be no party to a change in the representative system (Hisses.) He might, with time and circumstances, have altered his views;- and he (Mr. Gibson) would be one of theifirst to bail with joy the advent of a reform bil under the guidance of Lord Palmerston. It was more probable they would have it from Lord John. The first question, however, to be disposed of was that of the expenditure of the country. Lat session the Chancellor of the Excheq~uer said that next year we might fairly.expect to reap the entire benefite of peace-* if so wemust returnto apeace military establishment. ihere was a tendency in the country to encourage Government to take a fresh departure from the late war, to saddle the country with a permanent addition to the military establishment. He held to the ancient constitution and policy of England-a ver small standing army, looking to the navy as the means of efence. Military policy was at variance with the spirit of the English constitution. For this there was high authority ; the most eminent statesmen at the close of the war with France, Lord Brougham, Lord John RusselU, the Marquis of Lansdowne, and Sir James Macintosh, the lights of the Liberal party, were all opposed to the attempt to make the French war the commencement of a new military system in England. Lord Brou5ham perhaps more than any other statesman opposed it; hesaid he could see no end to be answered by a great permanent peace military establisbment but the mere gratification of a childish and contemptible love for military parade. Of that there was now a great deal to keep alive this military liking. It behoved us to watch with jealousy the growth of a great military power in England. Let it once become strongesr than the civil power, and he would a3sk them where (loud cheers)-where were our liberties then ? (Hear.) He had observed the speech of a gallantocolonel at an educational meetng at Bristol the other day, and, although he went apparently to address the members of the Bristol Athemnum on the mode of promoting education, his whole speech appeared addressed to them to encourage them to support a large army. He said the time was gone by when large armies could,be at aU viewed with any jealousy. In former days it was., no doubt, necessary to look sharp and vigilant after the Crown if it had at disposal a largo miltary force; but in these days we might be more indulgent. Now this was a very dangerous doctrine. Itwas a great lAndmark in our system not to allow a great military power to gow up in the country, to vie with the civil powers of the lnd. ThLi slow growth might end in a military estnblishment which we mightfind ourselves unable to control. Our Parliament might be filled with officers and our public departments filied with officers; all the influences of the State might go in that direction; and if we allowed this growth to go on without a check it might be too late vwhen we found it was dangerous to our liberties. (Applause.) He hadin his hand a quotation which he would read from the Marquis of Wellesley on this subject. He was the brother of the Duke of Wellington, and a man whose authority he (Mr. Gibson) was sure the most determined lovers of military establishments would not dispute; and what did he say ?-
E conomy, approaching even to parsimony, was the panoply of
peace, and those whomaintined that the security ot tfdi country depended on our maintaining great armies in a period of peace displayed an Ignorance Of the first principles of our constitution ; and not only that, but an Ignorance of the first priedple of ourtinsuar policy. *^hat was the Jiat principle o our consaitutiont The jemo,e.y Of standing armies was the elementary prindiple ol the constiltitoo, the source of our freedom, not muerely the jealousy of itiadianag armiAes without the consent of Parliament, butof standing
That was Lord Wellesley, and he (Mr. Gibson) did not go quite so fsr as that, for he was prepared for a small and efficient force; but it should be a very small one, and not such a force as he was afraid was now being contemplated by the Ministers of the Crown. Lord Panmuro had lately made a speech in which he told us it was meant to keep an anny in England, during the peace, that would be ready at 10 days' notice to bo landed on the continent. Not an army, then, for defence from foreign enemies, but an army of sufficient size and in such a state that it might lesve this land, and at 10 days notice go compaigning on the continent. But what a speech to make ! H ow indiscreet ! Indiscreet Ministerial speeches had been rather common of late
aughter); but he did think that for a Minister of the vwn to talk in that loose way of landing armies on the continent at 10 days' notice was very much to be regretted. What should we say in England, if the French War Minister were to make an announeement that they meant to keep an army in France in such a state of efficiency that at 10 days' notice it should be ready to land in England ? (^Hear, hear.) Why, we should be< in a state of pa"nic. But we thougt that the world was not as sensitive as onrselves.
ani that they could view England em-baring in the polcy of maintaining great aggressive forces without feel.
ug that it w.as necessary for other countries to strengthen their establishments, and without feeling suspicion of the faith of England. (Hear, hear.) Such speechee from Ministers of the Crown were not at all calculated to strengthen our friendly relations with foreign Powers. (EIear, bear.) They were calculated to excite jealousies and suspicions of our objects, and, step by step, perhaps to lead to serious misunderstandings, ending m war itself. Applause.) Olrmilitary, naval, andordnance establishments ormed the only field in which to operate for any saving of taxes. No reduction worth talking of could be made in our civil expenditure - and we must pay interest on the debts contracted with the public creditor. The whole question of taking off the income-tax, or any other, depended upon the army, navy, and ordnance to be kept up. (Hear, hear.) The income-tax agitators seemed to think that there was no relation between expenditure and taxation ; for many of them were in the habit of saying, " Oh I don't talk any of your peace nonsense. You must keep up your establishments: you must never be so unprepared for war as you were upon the last occasion." Of aU monstrous perversions of facts this doctrine of our not having been prepared for war was the greatest. (Hear, hear.) The losses in the Crimea&had no more to do vith not being prepared than they bad to do with the Tartar Emperor of China (Laughter.)
Our authorities were prepared. The British pubic supphed them with ample funds and materials; but the publiccould not supply the parties who had the management with brains. (Loud applause, more than once renewed.) The heaps of English skulls left in the Crimea lesulted from the incapacity of those who had the distribution of those thmins
that would have kept alive those unfortunate men. (Iear, ha.3000men in al lost their lives in the Crimiea * and itabenproved to demonstration that 25,000 of them had been sacrificed by being deprived of shelter, clothing, and food, of all that was absolutely necessary to keep up bkuuau existence, while the means of gupplyiiig those wfits
'Rere lying at Balaklava, because the man aging a6uthorities nad not the wit to distribute them. (Applause.) We bad bad commisioners, committees> and inquiries, but nosody was to blame; and all that was to be heud on that subjeo
was, " Never go to wax again without being better prepared." A very pretty shuffle and evasion I And as ii to show the public with what contempt they were regarded by the Government wheni they pretended to meddle with military affairs, the very men selected by commissioners and inquirers as being most to blame were singled out for rewards and honours. (Hear, hear.) With regard to taxation, he told them franklythat he was an advocate for the direct system. (Applause.) He believed that if we had to raise large amounts of taxes we might not be able to levy the whole by the direct system; but he thought that direct taxation should in Justice form a considerable portion of the whole taxation of the country. What was the case now? We raised 42,000,0001. a-year in indirect taxes, through the Customs and the Excise. This sum was paid by the great mass of the consumers of the country; and who were they ? The labouring classes. Nine-tenths of the population ofEngland therefore paid 42,000,0001. a-year on articles of consumption. When it was proposed to give rehef was there to be no thought of the present payers of that amount W We heard a great deal of impatience expressed. There was no doubt a great deal to be said in favour of the arguments against the present arrange-
ments of the Income-tax; bnt his conscience told him that, morerelief would be given to 'tbe laiouring and the commercial classes by dealing with the indirect taxes than by any other course of poicy. (Hear, hear.) The 42,000,0001. must have been advanced by the producers and the various dealers before the consumers of the commodities oould have paid for them. The consumers, therefore, had not only to pay 42,000,000k, but also an addition in the shape of trade profit upon that sum, which could not amount to less than 25 per cent., which was equivalent to another 1000,0001,OL a-year. So that while the Government got 42,000,0004 in indirect taxation from the people the people paid 10,000,0001. mnore. This was contrary to the Srst principle of taxation, which ought to be that & tax should go into the Exchequer as little reduced as possible on its way. But in this case the taxpayer parted with much mnore than reached the ExchequLer. He bielieved that the estimate of 10,000,0004. as the trade profit charged by the dealers before the artscle reached the constmer was a low one. Was it not monstrous that the policy of the late Sir Robert Peel should be abandoned when it was in our power to remove indirect taxes? He did not advocate the injustice of the Income-tax; he would he glad to see some arrangement which would make it acceptable. It might be at present too high; but he would advocate a fair and moderate Income-tax as a part of our germanent ordinary revenue. How were we to tax the
olders of property in land or the funds without such a tax ? A man with au estate yielding 10,0001. a-year might choose to spend all his time in Paris or Italy ; and there being no Income-tax he would not contribute one farthing to the expenses of that Government which had all the trouble to keep up the niachinery for taking care of his landed proprty while he was away. A rich bachelor, with 20,0001. of Three per Cent. Consols, might go abroad, where he would find the necessary commodities of life cheaper tban in England, and without an Income-tax he would contribute nothing to British taxation. But the classes to which he had referredwere especially those which should contribute to the taxation, and without: a fair Incometax those classes would not be caught. If the Incometax were repealed, we should surely find ourselves crippled for many years in the power of dealing with indirect taxation. It was, he admitted, disagreeable to have to pay both indirect taxes and Income-tax - but, in drawing a comparison of the evils of taxation, he believed that a moderate Income-tax, fairly adjusted in reference to the interests of trade and commerce, was a better tax for the interests of the community than taxes upon consumption, and especially upon those articles that were generally consumed by the great mass of the labouring clases. (Hear, hear.) there seemed now to be two wars in hand. The last war, among other evils, begot a restless spirit to embark in fresh military enterprise-to have left off with a sort of appetite to do something more. "The navy had done nothing ; the last affair of the English was not satisfactory." People had some kind of vague notion that there were laurels to be won in future wars, in order to set right a loss of honour and
g or -whatever it was called, in the last. They were ookiLg about for anopportunityfor war. The attack upon China was not casedx be thought, by the circumstances that were alleged as the pretext. The gradual increase of the forces in China since the affair of the lorcha took place looked as if they saw something looming in the distance-some necessity for using those forces. He thought there had been a meditated p lan for attacking China, with a view of what was called opening up" China, and under some notion that something was to be got by ir. He much doubted whether anythin was to be gained, except an increase of taxes here; any the true way of increasing our trade with China was not by battering down Chinese towns and killin- Chinamen, but by improving the condition of the people of this country, so as to enable them to purchase more tea, and thus enable the Chinese to purchase more of our manufactures. If every old woman in the country could buy as much tea as she could consume (laughter), among the poorer classes, there would be a much larger increase of the trade with China than ever we could get byknocking down Canton and burning all the factories. He thought when we spared Odessa we had adopted a poli more worth en enlightened and Christian people, and had abandoned the system of murdering noncombatant and inoffensive citizens because we happened to quarrel with their Government. Had the British fleet destroyed Odessa Europe at large would have condemned the act as barbarous and ruthless. If so, why were we to look with cold indifference upon such an act as the bombardment of a thickly-peopled town, destroying in one fell mass old and young, women and children, who knew nothing more about Commissioner Yeh and the old treaty of 1843, or Admiral Seymour, than the inhabitants of Iceland I Why were British merchants, and those of friendly nations, to have proper destroyed in their stores and warehouses without Mte slightest notice, so that they might remove their goods to aplace of safety? We looked with too much indifference on these things. He did not care whetherthe lorcha was a valid pretence for the dispute with Commissioner Yeh or not, whether it was desirable Admiral Seymour should have an interview with Yeh or not; but under any conceivable circumstance it was not justifiable to attack the mass of the unoffending, non-combatant, peaceful citizens of Canton.
- Blood and destruction reoem so much in use, A And dreadful objects so fanilar,
- That pity's choked with custom of oul deeds
And so it was that when we read day by day those frightful events there grew up-because, perhaps, they were in distant regions, and because in our own insular position we were safe here-a want of that due consideration which he thought would be becoming an enlightened and Christian nation. He protested, for one, against that Canton massacre, and he had not seen any justification published by the Government that could give them the shadow of an excuse for the conduct of their fleet in the China seas. (Applause Well, we were about to have an opportunity of discussing these questions in their fudness, and supptlie
with all details by the Governmentin Parli ment, and therefore he would no longer dwell on them now; but he would say that in his course in the House of Commons he saw no reason to deviate from the peslcy which, with others, he had endeavoured to support They had not run into any Quixotic or foolish measure, nor ill-considered, crude schemes; they had not pursued a vindictive opposition to the Government, nor to the members of the Conservative party; they had supported good measures, from wrhatever quarter they emanated. He thought that, for one, he could not do better than pursue that course. He felt it his duty to give, no doubt, many votes last session against the Government. There was one which he gave-and if he bad to give that vote again it would be in the same sense-namely, an utter condemnation of Her Majesty's Government for attempting to raise recruits in the United States, contrary to the Laws of that country (cheers), and havingzthereby had their ambassador sent, in no very complimentary manner, out of the country, besides endangering peace between two nations whose friendship not only was necessary for our own interest, but for the interest of all mankindtwo nations which ought to be cemented in the bonds of eternal amity - and 4l1 this about such a foolish affair as going to the United States employing a parcel of crimps and agents to raise men for the British Foreign Legion. And would it be believed that they went to the United States to seatch for Germans ? (Hear, hear.) How many did they get? Why, 37! (Loud laughter.) What did they cost
He was told, on the best authority, that those 37 Germans cost nearly 40,0001 sterling! ("Oh, oh!" and hisses) in the expenses we had to pay to crimps and agents for running secretly over the United States and violating the laws of a fnendly nation. (Hear, bear.) Thirty-seven Germans at a cost of 40,0001-our Minister sent out of the country in disgrace-and our approach, he would not say to war, but to a very serious misunderstanding with the Government of that country !-all that they caUed a great and wise policy, and he and others were blamed for voting against it. (Hear, hear.) If he were never to give another vote in Parliament he would, if required, repeat the vote he gave in utter condemnation of such foolish and senseless proceedings. (Lend applause.) He must say a word about the press-a subject in which he had felt, and did feel, a deep interest.

It was said that the repeal of the advertisement duty and the newspaper stamp had failed in the country generally; ut before the set of measures was complete the paper duty must beabolished.

The Late Duke Of Rutland.
TEH LATE DUKE OF BUTLAND.
TO THE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES. )
Sir,-There can be now no indelicacy in publishing.the foUowing domestic anecdote of the late Duke of Rutland, whose death you have recently announced, and whose whole life might be cited as an example of the highest princip)es and most refined tastes united with the utmost personal modesty and the widest social benevolence.
It happened that I and one other private friend spent the last day of the year 1848, which happened to be Sunday, with his Grace, at a small old house of his in a very retiled part of the Derbyshire hiUls. In the morning his Grace and his two guests walked a couple of miles to attend the 41east place of public worship-a kind of schoolhouse chapel on qne ef his estates-but at night the Duke himself read fasjly prayers to his domestic congregation, consisting of his twe friends, a few of his ordinary servants who accompanied him to the Woodhouse, as the little mansion was called, and a, largernumber of the inferiorservants,belongingto tholocality. After the prayers his Grace read a short sermon-I thipk one of Paley's-and after that he addressed them by the titlo of his " kind friends," praised them for the good or4er "in which they had conducted their several duties in the last year," expressed his satisfaction at having, as he hoped, contributed in return to their welfare and happiness, nd' honed that the year which was just about to begin might be equally propitious and prosperous to the whole domestic circle and connexion of which he was proud and happy to be, he would not say the master, but the chief partaer -the responsible head and guiding hand.
I never in my life heard a more appropriate and touching allocution. It was both simple and more in detail thapa I bave been able to give it, though I made my note that evening; and it was followed by a respectful cordiality of assent from the little audience, and an affectionate murmur of " God bless your Grace," which was very affecting.

The State Of Caffraria.
THE STATE OF CAPFEARrA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Before the fears of another Caffre war are altogether forgotten in questions of more immediate interest will you allow me a brief space in your columns to call attention to, the satisfactory result already obtained by Sir George Grey's system of policy, of which, if successful, the ultimate effect must be to prevent entirelytherecurrenoeof theseperiodical outbreaks with all their miserable consequencs ? One part, Indeed, of the moasures proposed-the formation of military colonies along the frontiers-remains as yeb untried; but the otherpartwhich Sir Georgo Greyregarded am far more important-the attempt to turn these border tribes into friends and produoers for our markets, by instructing them in agricultmre and other arts of civilized life, employing them in public works, and encouraging the missions which are supported by the different religions bodies, has now been in operation nearly two years. WeU might Lord J. Russell describe this experiment as one of vbl importance, in which " if we succeed, we secure the colony of the Cape from invasion," while 1" we open a va st territory to the influence of Christianity." That the experiment must suceed ultimately, if fairly tried, no Christian man. will doubt. Bat, in fact, a sufficient earnest of final saccess is already afforded, not merely in the readiness with which, after a time of excitement, the natives have retarned --t
peacfahl pursuits, but in the remarkable changes which are now taking place in British Caffraria. The letters received from the missicnary agents of the church of England describe all as stir and activity there where two years previoasly there was complete stagnation. Through the judicious expenditure of the grants of the British Parliament for the employment of the natives capitl is being set afloat and a general stimulus given to trade; excetlent roads are being made, surveys of the whole country are in progress, a port is in the course of formation, and a new province is rapidly rising into life. It is at the same time satisfactory to find that the encouragement given to Christian missions there does not interfere with their freedom of action; but the chief want, as regards the part which the church of England ought to bear in this great national work, is that of buitable men, both as missionaries and lay agents. I cannot suppose that this want will continue to be felt when th importance of the experiment now being made becomes generally appreciated.

The noble duke in person, as well as the Earl of Lincoln and other youtha lords of his family, busied themselves in attention to their guests. His grace appeared highly to enjoy the 'orilliant scene which he had conjured up around him, and danced a t deal in the course of the evening-opening the bal th the beautiful and accomplished Lady Elizabeth York, daughter of the Earl of Hardwicke, pronounced by many of those present the belle of the ball. Refreshments were abundantly supplied throughout the evening in. several of the saloons, and dancing was sustained without interruption. At half-past 12 o'clock supper was an. nounced in the grand dining haUl,on the walls of which hang those five superb and justly celebrated pictures by Sneyders. This entertainment comprised everv luxury ins profusion which the most unlimited means and finest tse could supply. The centre dish consisted of a grand boar's head. The champagne flowed like spring-water. The departures did not commence till towards 3 a.m., from which uour they continued with the utmost order and regularitystabling and ccommodation for 300 horses having been provided by the noble duke's order, and measures taken to ensure every facility "to speed the parting" as weU as to w weloome the coming guest." Among other pleasing incidents of this fimlile we must not omit to mention that, stationed in the hall, in a huge case of filagree or open brass work, said to have been brought by his Grace from the Crimea, there steamed a portentous vessel filed with spiced and mulled claret, which a Ganymede of the usual six-feet dimensions dispensed with cordial liberality to the ladies while waiting till their carriages "stopped the way ," whilo the sterner nerves of the "lords of creation" were fortified ad libitum with hot punch, to qualify them to contend with nine degrees of frost in their transit through the Forest of Sherwood.

The War In China.
THE WAR IN CHINA.
(From the London Gorcc of Jan. 30.
Admiralty, Jan. 29.
Despatches, of which the following are oopDes, have been received from Rear-Admirar Sir ciihael Seymoxir, K.O.B., Commander-in-Ohief of Her Majesty's ships and vessels on the East India and China station:-
"No. 116. " Niger, at Canton, Dec. 14, 1856.
"Sir,-I have the honour to report proceodings at Canton since my letter, No. 106, of the 2itk ult., for the informa. tion of the Lords Commisioners of the Adtmiralty.
" 2. On the 25th the United State' Commiloner in. formed American citizens that the Imperial High Cosnisduoner having failed to render satisfaction for the recent Insult to their flag Commodore Armstrong would not desist from aggeve measures till ample apology should be made, aMd a guarantee given that the American flag should be re spected for the future.
"The Commodore determined OR the demolition of the Barrier Forts, the capture of which I have already reported, and 4ommenced blowiing them up.
" In the afternoon of the same day 37 war junks isued from a creek, and anchored in line about four miles from the EnCounter in shoal water. Captain O'Callaghan endeawonied to get within range of them the following day, hut 'Withouteffect. The Chinese fired several shots, which fell short These junks have ince retired.
"3. Reports having reached me that the Chinese were busily employed in remarming the Blenheim Fort, I sent the
arraconta down the Nacao Passage on the 26th, with Captain Twiss wad A party of Royal Artillery, to check any such proceedings, and to destroy "he fort. About 150 soldiers were found there, and 15 guns had been mounted The troops were driven out and the guns rendered useless; a foW mines under the works completely destroyed them. Commnder Forteecue, before leaving, informed the head Man of the adjoining village, who had superintended the progres of the works under promise of reward from the Mandarins, that any further attempt to restore the fort would result in the burning of the plae.
" 4. On the 29th two 10-inch mortars were mounted on the Dutch Folly, and their range was tried on the French Folly Fort.
" 5. On the 3d inst. a most melancholy occurrence took Place Captain Cowper, R.E., who had been detached for service at Cauton, was superintending the pulling down of some Chinese houses outside the factory, when one of them Suddenly fell on him, from which he sustained such extena sive injuries as to cause his death in less than three hours Captain Cowper had been of the greatest assistance in Strengthening our position, and I cuaot too highly expres, my admiration of the zeal and professional ability he dis, payed. Her Majesty's servioe hs sustained a severe lossin hIs untimely end. I sent the Coromandel to E[ongkosg *ith the remains of the deceaed gallant officer.
"6. The Chinese authorities having re-armed and strength. cnedthe French Folly fott, situated near the south-east city gate, baving in its rear extensive barracks ocoupiedbytroopsg and erected flanking sandbag batteries on either side of it Uotwithstanaing we had endeavoured to check them by the fie of the guns and mortars ia the Dutch Folly, I deter, mianed on its deetruction, as threatening a hostile concen tration of force, and being an obstacle tothe free navigation of the river by the passage through the Barrier Forts. The Encounter and Barracouta accordingly shifted their positions to below the Dutch Folly on the evening of the 3d, and on the folowing morning I embarked in the Encounter, and dropped down to the fort, accompanied by the boats of the squadron, having on board about 350 small-arm men and 3oyal 3arines, under the command of Captain Wilson and the Hon. A. A. Cohralle, C.B., of the Winchester and Niger, and Captains Penrose and Boyle of the Royal Mazines. The ships were anchored about 850 yards from the fort, being as near a the depth of water Permitted, nd at 7 a.m. a heavy and effective fire Was opened from them, and from the Dutch Folly; the boats soon after pushed on shore, and our flag was planted on the wal of the fort amidst the hearty cheers of the assailing parties. The Chinese troops twice attempted to rally, but were quickly driven back, and the affair was over within one hour from the first gun being fired The fort mounted about 20 heavy guns, with others of various calibre in the sandbag batteries. Thosein the fort were mounted somewhat similarly to ships' guns, with breechings secured to spars across the outside of the embrasures. This gives some colour to the report that many of the garrison had served in European ships.
"The usual official placards were found on the wlls of the French Folly, offering rewards for the murder of all English. men, and of Chinese in their employ.
"As soon as resistance had ceased, a party of Royal Artillery, under command of Captain G. Rolton, commenced the destruction of the fort.
" Mines were, sunk and sprung under the works, which laid the whole of the massive granite in * heap of ruins, barely one stone being left in its original position. The guns were destroyed, and their new carriages burt. Throughout the day feeble attempts were made by the Chinese troops to disturb our operations, rendering it nece. sary for our covering parties and boats' guns to keep them from advancing. These buildings ultimately caught fire, and were burnt to the ground.
" During our operations the Dutch Folly Fort, in charge of Commodore Hon. C. Elliot, threw shells from the mortars into the city, where troops had been previously observed, which fortunately exploded two magazlnes.
" The gallantry and promptitude displayed by the officers and men, and the rapid suoccss which crowned their exertions, deserve my warmest commendation. I am happy to be able to state that our loss only amounted to one private, Royal Marines, of Her Majesty's ship Winchester, killed, and one seaman slightly wounded.
" The ships were hulled several times-the Encounter by a 68-pounder shot. The ships returned to the Factory Creek on the 5th.
" It has been reported that the Chinese authorities placed great confidence in the strength of the fort, backed as it was by the presence of a large body of troops. On the 6th, a seaman belonging to the Comus, and a private Royal Marine, of the Sybifle, having, contrary to orders, strayed from their post in the Macao Fort to Honam Island, were attacked by some of the inhabitants of the village of Nan Pien. The marine was murdered, and his head carried off; the seaman jumped into the river, And vas drowned The next day I sent the Barracouta to the locality, and burnt the vilage, which was found deserted I also issued a proclamation, of which I enclose a copy, pointing out the cause of this punishment, and threatening the same consequences should any Enidishman lose his life in a similar manner.
" 8. The American ships of war completed the demolition of the Barrier Forts on the 6th, and dropped down to Whamnpe. These forts were of enormous strength and solidity, being entirely built of large blocks of granite, with
lls 9 or 10 feet thick: They were heavily armed, many of the guns being 7 or 8 tons weight, with a bore of 13 inches; one brass 8.3-inch gun was over 21 feet long.
"The Levant arrived yesterday at Canton.
"9. A party of 90 offictrs and men, belonging to the alcutta, came up on the 7th to replace the Winchester'8 detachment.
" 10 I visited the Bogue Forts on the 8th. They have been effectually dismantled under the dizection of Captain the Hlon. Keith Stewart, of the Nankin.
"1L A seaman belonging to one of the river steamers was seized by some of the officials on the 12th inst., who attempted to kill him. He managed, however, to effect his escapo, though severely wounded. I immediately despatched Captain Hall topuU down the Government buildings and Custom-house, where the seizure was made, which was promptly executed. It is only by summary proceedings that we can hope to avert the evil intent of the High Coim nissi0ne's premiums for our heads.
" 12. Numerous comnplaints of pircies in the neighbour hood of Hongkong having been made to me, I despatched the Sampeon to check them In her first cruise she cap tured one junk and destroyed five. In the seeond she saw no suspicious vessels, and is now at Hongkong.

The country is represented to be in a most disorganized

" 14. The stoppage of the traffic at Canton must cause a svere pre e. The river, which used to b e thronged with junks and boats, is now comparativelyclear, and I feel a confident hope that the measures which have been taken will prove successful.

Yesterday, however, two of our men landing at the villae of Nsn-plen, were there kllUed by some Chinese, who so t to gain by this inhuman act the paltry reward offered or the murder of our countrymen by all local authorities. As a warning, therefore, to the other villages, I have burned Nan-pien to the ground, but being unwilling to involve the innooent with the guity I have spared the lives of its inhabitants.

" Sir, -According to my intentions, intimated to you in my letter of the 4th inst., I proceeded to sea yesterday morning, with four Chinese who had had their vessels taken away from them, and directed m; search towards Inttin.

Having done so, in proceeding through the Mandarin Channel, some junks were observed at anchor inside ChangpaidIsland, close in the north-east corner. My pilot not being acquainted with the channel I got a fisherman's boat to go up with one of tie Chinamen that I had on board to see whether he could recognize his p,roperty, He shortly returned on board, saying that his bat was there, and that the other boats were pirates. I immediately stood in under easy steam, when the pirates, seeing mv intention, made sail and ran through the channel toviards Wan-Chow-Chow. I fired a few shots at them, but they soon got under the cover of the land. Then, sending m boats after then, and running round outside the island, I had the satisfaction of driving them on shore and destroy. ing five, as well as lberating two market boats, with several passengers who had been In confinement for several

Sir,-I have the honour to acquaint you, for the informiiatin of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, that last night, at abotut 11 o'clock, a few hours after the departure of my despatches for Europe, the Chinese set fire in several places simultaneously to the houses immediately surrounding the factory, which soon spread to the factory itself; and aU the foreign establishments, with the exception of the English factory, have been burnt to the ground. The fire appears to have been checked by the blowing down of the end hous of the adjoining block at the entrance of Hog-lane.

Tlis appeal was argued on the 20th, 22d, 24th, and Zth of Noveu,ber last, and was one involving, the greatest amount of complication as to the priority ot securities thai could be developed even in an enormous mass of papers, and this morning stood for judgment. The suit was descrbed from the bench as one in which as each counsel rose he opened a new case, and that the litigation became after every speech moro unintelligible, more complicated, more c ontused, and more intricate. This being so, any attomp: to give even a sketch suitable to the confined limits of this paper is hopeless. Lord Justice Turner delivered the judgmnent of the Court, concluding by reading the minutes o~ the decree, wrhich minutes were oÂ£ theo most elaborate
The following were the counsel to whose Ingenuity was owing the variety of pkAses in which the case was presented tothe Court-namely, Mr. Swanston, lra Wigram, Mc. Malins, Mfr.

FAREBROTHPR V. WODMIlOUSKE
The plaintiff in this case, which is an appeal from a decision of the Master of the Rolls, was one of the trustees for a Mr. Croughton. the defendants being the trustees of the Norwich Union Life AEurance Company, and the juestion in the suit was a right to tack under the specla cir. ciusmtances of the case, although the apeal was, in point of fact, by the especial reservation made by the Master of the Rolls, upon the queston of costs. The Norwich Company advanced to Mr. Croughton 3,000g. and 2,00uh., the former on a mortgage and the latter upon a bond, and in that bond MIr. Farebrother became surety, he having full knowledge of the other advance. The Norwich Company, upon their debtor taking the benefit of the Insolvent Act, brought an action against Mr. Farebrother for the balance due upon the 2,0001. bond, whereupon the latter filed a bill to restrain its further prosecution, and to have a policl of assurance of which he and another were trustees, and which forned pat of the mortgage security delivered UD to him on u
ment of the balanoe by him of the 2,0001. debt for whic)i he had become surety. The comnpany, however, insisted oil their right to hold the policy as security for the 3,000L After the suit was commenced the suffidency of the other sectrities for the 3,0001. was ascertained, and the polic wvas at the hearing offered to dellvered up, and the iaster of the Rolls made his decree accordingly, and directed the whole costs to be paid by the plaintiff, the surety.
Mr. Selwyn and Mr. G. IL Giffard appeared for the ap-. pellant, the plaintiff; Mr. Roundell Palmer and Mr, Baggallay were in support of the decision of the Master of the
LordJustioe XMGHT EBuo, after bearing a part only of the opening of MIr. Selwyn, said, he had d over the case and the judgment of his Honour the Master of the Rolls, and it struck him (subject, of course, to any change of view that might be effected by the arguments of counsel) that if the plaintiff was wrong in filing the bill to establish so difficult and obscure an equity, which that bill asserted it was not an unresonable question to raise. On the other hand, if the defendant, owing to this diffiult and obscure equity, opposed the plaintiff's claim, it ws not unreasonable on hi part to take the opinion of the Court ulon it; and that the case was therefore not one to call or costs against either sde. His Lordahip had noheadtation in saylng this, altheugh if the arguments were heard to the end it might alter that view. The question Wng one reduced solely to a dispute about cose, a court of justico ought not to be called upon to listen towhat was no more than a mere Juridical excercitation; but the costs from beginning to end of the suit in this court ought to be paid by the parties on
lr. SELWyx, on behalf of the plaintiff, said, he was happytossay that he was authorked to accede to that view.
Lord Justice TUxi added that he had also considered the case, and had come to the same conclusion. He would only make this further observation, that, as the security appeared to be sufficent, the question was reduced to the mere point whether the bill was properly filed.
Mr. BAVGGALAY (in the absence of his leader) gave a hesitating assent; and so the matter onded.

TODD V. STUDHOLSEE
The VICE-CHAIORLLoR gave judgment in this case which has been recently argued. The plaintiff, who was the widow of Robert Todd, was entitled, as his representative, to a mortgage security for 1,00. upon certain propery sold under adeem of the Court in a suit of "Hodgson v. Hodgson," which bhd been instituted for compelling payment of the debts of John Hodgson, the deceased mortgagor, and the administration of his estate. A decree was miade in the suit for the sale of his real estates. Robert Todd, who was the transferee of the original mortgage created by John Hodgson, had on several occasions refused to sign any documents or to concurinthe conveyancesto purcbasersuntil he bad received his mortgage mone and interest. Within 48 hours of his death, however (in June, 1851), he was prevailed upon by llr. John Tiffin, a solicitor of Wigton, when in a very weak and exhausted state, arising from a
c attack, to sign the convoyances to the paries who t phchld uased umder the decree, and thereupon paid the purchase-money into court. In March, 1852, A decree was made in " Hodgson v. Hodgson" upon further directions, by which the purchase-money of the real estates which bad been paid into court, and the remaining property of John Hodgson, were ordered to be applied in payment of his creditors The several creditors,not mduding the plaintiff whose mortpge debt was in effect ignored, received payment of their debts under this deoree. Mr. Studholme, who was the partner of John Tiffin, had received in discharge of a specialty debt a portion of the proceeds of the estate under this decree, though it appeared from the evidence that he had not received this money for his own specialty debt, bat as trustee for other persons. Although the firm of Studholme and Tiffin had acted as the solicitors of Robert Todd, and after his death for his widow the plaintiff. they had activelyconcernedthemsevesinthe dlstributionof Hlodgeon's estate, without giving her any Information whatever as to her rights or making any provision for them. The plaintiff, who had only discovered early in 1854, from the non-pay. ment of interest, that the proceeds of her secrtity had bean distributed, had served a notice of her mortgage debt unon the creditors who had been paid under the decree (except Joseph Studholme) calling upon them for repayment,and in default threateniig them with proceedings in Chancery. She had in April, 1856, filed a bill againstthevarious creditors and purchasers, praying payment of her mortgage money and interest, and conseetisl rief, and charging that the conduct of the defendant Studholme in allowing and participating in the distribution of the funds, without giving notice to the plaintiff or protecting her interesta,was, if not wilfully fraudulent, so grossly negligent, as to amount in equity to a fraud, and to renderhim personallyresponsible to her. The plaintiff, alo, charged that the conduct of the defendants, Messrs. GreDggthe solicitors hhaving the conduct of the suit ' Hfodgson v,llodgson," and who had full notice of the plaintiil's security,was grosly negligent, ad breach of their duty, and that such order as to costs or otherwise against them ought to be made as should seem just to the
The case was argued by Mr. ROLT and Mr. ,DGSHAwz, jun., for the plaintiff; and by Mr. DI)AwIz, Mr. CAINS, Mr. OSBORNX, Mx. EDDIS, Mr. FAB1R, Mr. BRODRICK, and Mr. PLiaPs, on behalf of the several defendants,
His HoNiouR, after stating the circumstances, said, that the plaintiff bad a clear right to proceed against the sever&l creditors for re-payment of her mortgage debt, and that as to the simple contract creditors she was entitled to recover from them the full amount which they had received. As to the specialty creditors, they would have a right to deduct 'what might be received from the other defendants, and then pay the ce necessary to satisfy the plaintiff's debt. As to any loss arising from the insolvency of those creditors who had been paid, or from not being able to discover them, Messrs Gregg must be fixed, As they had taken upon themselves to see the money distributed,and had, from their great want of care, occasioned the whole dif'iculty. As to the purchasers, no right could be established as against themthey took their conveyances in consideration of paying the purchase-money into court, and had done all they could wth the exception, perhaps, of not demanding the titleeehds from Todd. em, the bill would be dismissed
Mr. FABER mentioned that, in the conveyance to his client, who was a purchaser of one of the lots, there was a covenant for production of the deeds.
His Honious sd that, as to this purchase, the bill woald be dismissed with costs. He should have been very glad if he could have made those who represented the estate, John Tiffin, who had been guilty of the grossest imaginable negligence to his client, answerable in costs, but he did not see bovw he could do it. An between the Greggs and the creditors, the cobts would properly fall on the Gr ,,ad his only hesitation was as to whether the creditors shoDay costa. If they had attendsd to the circular issued by the plaintiff they might have saved being brought here, but on the other hand the money came intotheirpossesoixn throngh no actual fault of theirs, and he did notthink he couldmake them pay any costs. He should direct the balance of the costs of the suit to be paid by Messrs. Gregg.
A decree was made in accordance with his Honour's j dgment, liberty being reserved to Messrs Gregg to enfore it for anythingthey might be oalled upon to pay in r,spect of the deficiency,
ATTrNDA1NCE OP SOLICITORS.
In the course of the day an pplication was made that a cause in which a decree had been yesterday taken in the absence of either counsel or solictor for the defenda,,t might he re-heard, the brief of counsel, which had be- n senz on Wednesday;night, havin remained in his letter-box until this morning, while the xoditor bad been summoncd to attend a funeral in the country.
The VICE-CRAINCELLOR took occasion to observe that solicitors seemed to think it no part of their business to attendthis court. It wva a circumstance which had struck himverypainfully,and hehad notintended tolet itpass unnoticed, that he had recentlyheard no less than seven causeg in this court without the attendance of a siugle solictor. This was extremely to be reprehended, and it was at lea.t to be expected that when a cause came on to be heard, either the counsel or the solicitor should be in attendance. As to the parcular application, the defendant was at the mercy of the plaintiff, who was entitled, if he wished it, to hold the decree.

The Court had taken time to consider whether this was a good answer to the asp$icaltion and, as it was understood the same question had arsen in all the Courts, their Lordships had expressed their desire, before giving judgment, to confer with the
Lord CAMPBLfLL now said this was an aplic tion for leave to take out execution against an individual shareholder of tha Royal Britlsh Bank, to which the shareholder answered that ke bad been induced by fraud to take the sbares which be held in the bank. The shareholder had remained a shareholder and received his dividends until the bank stopped psyment and became insolvent. He then gave motice in the Court of Bankruptcy, and as far as he oduld he disafflrmed the contract, and demanded back all the moneywhich he had paid. The qestion now was whether, If it were establish a this raud had been practised upon him, that would be an answer to the preeent application. If that were to be admitted as an answer, the Court would not make this rule absolute, but would grant a scire facuu, in order that the truth Of the suggestion might be tried. The Court, however, entertained no doubt upon the subject; but, as they were in. formed that rules raising the same point were pending in both the Common Pleas and Exchequer, they thought that on a matter of this sort they would confer with the other judges before pronouncing judgment. They had had an opportunity of so doing, and a the judges were of opinionthat it was no answer to the application. The argument could not be rested on any princmple or decision. The application was made by a creditor who, on the i of the party being a shareholder, deposited his money in the bank, and had now obtained udgnent against the basik. The application now
at he (the plaintiff) may have execution against him (the shareholder). It is impossible to say that he being a shareholder, and who held himself out to the plaintiff as such, and remained so down to the time when the bsnk stopped payment, can now say, "I have been defrauded,L and so get rid of his liability to the creditors of the bank. Whether he can say that to other shareholders pivy to the fraud the Court may have some difficulty in determining; but it is not now necessary to determine that question, for this is an application by a creditor. Suppose the case of a common partnership, and credit given to the firm, and an action brought aainst the firm, would it be an answer to say that one partner was induced by fraud to become a partner? Between a partner and a creditor of he partnership sch a question would be wholly immaterial. The party here admits that he was a shareholder, nd continued so til the hank stopped His Lordship then referred to the objection that there was an Irregularity as to the memoria of the register of shareholders, wrhich was not malde within the time directed by the statute, And said te Cout were of opinion that the statute s merely directory, and did not make the memorial being ccording to the act a condition, Pr1mid facke, he was a sholder and he was bound by his name being now on the registerRule abcolute.
T QUE V. MARSH AND OTHES
In this case a rule had been gnted, calling upon certain justicee of Monmouthshire to show cause why a mandam%s should not issue, commanding them to hear and determine an information laid before them on the 8th of July, 1856 by Mr. Herbert Mackworth, the inspector of coalmines, charging the defendants with an offence ainst the statute the 18th and l9th Victoria, chap. 108, relsting to the ven. tilation and inspecton of coalmines.
Sir F Tumsrosm (with whom was Ir. J. Gray), in showing cause against the rule, said the magistrates had dismissed the information, upon the ground that they had no jurisdiction to convict, as they were barred bv the statute, which limited three months as the time within which a conviction must tal-e plae. The offence was committed on the 8th of July, and the information was lid on the 30th of July; but the hearing did not take place till the 27th of October, more than three months after the offence was alleged to have been committed. The learned counsel contended that the magistrates were right in dismissing the information, for by thel4th section of the act itwasenacted tat all penalties for offences should be recovered before the justices within three months from the commission of the same. That did not mean that the information should be laid within the three months, but that the penalty must be recovered by the conviction of the parties within that time.
The SoLcICITOBG ExA who (with Mr. Welsby) a
peard to support the rule, said he was not aware ot the fact that there had been such delay.
Sir P. THESTGER saId it appeared on the affidavits that the sunmonses were not served till the 25th of October.
Lord CA_rarnPBL said the Court were al of opinion that under these circumsbnces they could not interfere by m7andamun
Mr. WErsBy said the ma"mistrate's clerk had undertaken to send the summonses on A the informations. The blame did not lie with the Inspector or with the attorney.
Lord CAMPBELL said this was a most salutary act of Parliament, and the Court would be bound to assiat in carrying it into effect. From what cause the delay had arisen it was not necessary to inquire; but there had been improper delay, and therefore this Court could not interfere.
The SOLICITOR.GEn-RAL said that on the main point he should have been able to show that there ought tolbe a mandhmus.
Rule discharged.
TEEH QUEE V. THE TIVERTON BOARD OF HEALTTE.
In this case a rule had been granted, calling upon the Tiverton Board of Health to show cause why they should not forthwith put that portion of the burialground provided by the board to be consecrated for buria according to the rites of the Church of England in such a state as should render it fit and proper to be consecrated by the bishop of the dioce3s for interment according to the rites of the Church of England.
Mr. Serjeant ByLxs (with whom was Mr. Collier and Mr. Kingdon) now appeared to show cause against the ruleThe application was made under the 7th section of the 16th and 17th of Victoria, cap. 134, which, after extending certain provisions of the Metropolis Burial Act (the 15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 85) to the country generally, provided "that in all cases in which any burialboardshall provide a new burialground under the said act of the last ses. sion of Parliament, or under this act, that new burialgroind sball be divided into consecrated and uncoasecrated parts in such proportions, and the unconsecrated part thereof shall be allotted in such manner and in such portions, as may be sanctioned by one of Her Majesty's principal Secretaries of State; and when any burial board shaU by virtue of section 30 of the sWad act build on any burlalground provided by such board a chapel for the performance of the burial service according to the rites of the Church of England and Ireland, they shall also build on a portion of such ground set apart for burials otherwise than according to the rite of the said church such chapel accommodation for the performance of burial service by persons not being members of the said church as may be approved of by one Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State." The learned counsel stated that under this act the burial board of Tiverton had pro. vided a cemetery, which wass entirely enclosed with a wail varyig from six to eight feet in heiLght, and that the enclosure was divided into two portions, one intended to be consecrated and the other not. The two portions were separated by a stone wall, 18 inches in height, and constructed of solid masonry. The question was whether the two portions of the cemetery were sufficiently " divided," as required by the act. The burial board and the parishioners considered that it was, but the applicants and the bishop's secretary said the part intended to be consecrated was not sufficiently fenced, and the bishop required that there should be either a wall or a railing four feet hi-h. The learned counml produced a large model to explain the existing state of the cemetery, with its walls. He then contended that the ground for the writ failed altogether, for the whole cemetery was surrounded by a wall from six to eight feet in height. The learned counsel then referred to the Cemetery Company's Act, the 10th and Uth of Victoria, cap. 65, which, by the 24th sectioa, enacted " that the company shall define by suitable marks the consecrated and unconsecrated portions of the caemetery." That statute was not incorporated in the present act. In tho year 1853 the burial board had raised the sum of 2.5001., and that sum, together with an additional sum of 1301., had been all expended- but it would be said that before the new walls existed tiiere had been an agreement made between the board and the bishop to build a wall between the two portions of the cemetery.
Lord CAxPRELL said that could not affect the quesAion. Mr. Justice WIGHTM} said the question was whether a waUl 18 inches high was sufficient.
Mr. Serjeant BYLZS said that was the question, whether, the cemetery being surrounded by a wall from six to eight feet high, a waill 18 inches high wras a suficident divisionor w^hether, as the bishop required, there should he a wrall four feet high, or an iron palisade, resting on bond
btones.
.Mr. Justice WIGHTAN said the question was whether this fence was enough.
Lord CAmIPmEnL said the Court entertained doubts whether any opinion, however respectable, could be brought forward.
Mr. Serjeant BYLES said he did not Wish to refer to any opinions as such, but only to show what, in point of fact, were suffiient divisions in such cases. The learned counsel then referred to what had been done by other bishops in
such cases, and which showed that the usual division required by the bishops in cemeteries made under the act was a gravel walk with boundary stones at the end, and in some few instances occasional stones along the walk. The only exception was that of the late Bishop of Carlisle, who insisted on a wall, and declined to consecrate the ground until the wall was built; but his successor tte
present bishop, had expressed himself satisfied with a simele line of dewarcatibn. In the present case the Exeter Burial Board had done more than wag required in any of these cases, for they had erected a solid stone waU 18 inches high,
and 'they objected to perpetuating insidious distinctions
after death among people wvho lay down in the grave with
the samlte hopes.
Mr. Justice COLEETDOL-Hiowr is *astone wall more offendive than a line of demarcationt I do not admnit that either would be so.
Mr. Serjeant BYLT S said there were parties who felt the
difference, though he could not expect to satisfy tho Court upon that point. The learned serjeant proceeded to contend that by the common law of England there wsno necessity
for consecratiOn at alL. Even a hurch might be built without being consecrated, and Diine service nmight be solemnMr. Justice COLEitD)OG-Nkot without a liense.
Mr. Serjeant BYLES would not say that; bnt he conten?ed that consecration Wa not necessLry even for a church. 11H knew that there was a church in London, which was
built for Dr. Sacheverel, in which Divine aervica Faa been solemnized for 150 year bat which hid nevr been consecatetd. At the present titne burials wrar.going oID boh prts Of this burialground, not by ministers of tOe Chu=ch o rEngland, but by gentlemen who had no objectiontoreadtheservice of theChurch of England. In #o doing they were but returning to the ancient prctioe which prevailed down to the year A.D. 700 or A.D. 80D. This was clearly shown by apassapein Burn's .Ecc. Lazo, which the lerned serjeaut read as follows :-" As tD the original ef bturial place many writers bave observed that at the first erection of churches no part of the adjaoent ground was allotted for interment of the dead; but some Place for this, &urposo wa!s appointed at a further distanc, especially in citieg and populoustowns, where, agreabi7jto the old Roman law of the 12 tables, i theplace of inmastioa was without the walls, first, indefinitey by the way-side, then in some pe. collar enclosure assignedl to that use. Therefore the Romanx pontifical, among otlerinventions, isin this respect convicted oferror, that itmkMrelsne tetrn.lrnis appoint 25 churches In Rome to buy matyrsn , wheni at that time laws and customs did fori7all burial within the
city. Hence the Augustine monartery was built without the walls of Canterbury (as Ethelbort and Augustin
both their charters intimate), that it might be a dormitory to them and their successors, the kings and the archbishooL for ever. This practice of remoter burials continued to to
age of Gregory the Great, when the monks and priests beginning to offer for souls departed procured leave for their greater ease and profit that a liberty of sepultur
might be in churches or in places belonging to them. This mercenary reason xeems to be acknowledged by Pope Gregory himself, while he allows that when the parties deceasing are not burdened with heAvy sins it may thenbe a benefit to them to be buried in churches; becauss their friends and relations, as often as they come to those sacred places, seeing their graves, xnsy remember them and pray to God for them. After this Cuthbert, Archbishop of Comt rbur brug over from Rome this practice into X and,abont the year 750; from which time they date the origin of churchyards in this island." That showed that in ancient times cemeteries were not connected with places of religious worship, and there was no authority for saying that they must be consecrated. It b;
on the prosecutors to show that there was an obligation under this statute to make the ground fit for conaecration.
Lord C.swnBxLL.-It must be necessarily and exclusively a statutory obligation.
1r. Serieaut ByLxs said that according to law a churchyard must be so fenced as to keep out animals and to prevent its desecration, and aocordingly the erection and maintenance of a wall to a churchyard was a matter to which a church-rate extended equally with the maintenance of the church and the due administiation of Divine service. But the only statutes which referred to this case were the 15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 85, and the 16th and 17th of Victoria, cap. 134. The prosecutors would rely on the 30th section of the 15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 85,
Lord CAMPwBLL.-Those are the words on which this rule is framod.
Mr. Serjeant BYLS.-They would contend upon that that the ground must be fit for consecration or, in other words, it must be put in such a state as, in te opinion of the bishop, would render it fit for consecration. If there was to be a wall there would bo two burialurounds, which was not intended. The act said there shot d be one cemetery, but it provided that the " new burialground shall be divided into consecrated and unconsecrated pat" the meaning of which was that there should be such a division as should distinguish the one portion from the other.
l&r. Justice CoMsPTox.-It wag not intended that there should be two cemeteries,
Lord CAMPNBE,.-Thore is to be one oemetery divided into two portions for different denominations.
Mr. Serjeant BYLms said that if the cemetery was properly fenced it was enough.
Lord CAawBaLu-If the oemetery be properly feneed that will protect the whole.
Mr. Justice COLXz}RGL-The question would still remain whetber, in order to be fit for consecration, it does not require to be fenced so as to satisfy the canon law.
Lord CA3IIi3.BLL-You must look and see what the intention of the Legislature was in the statute, and whether the burial board had fulfiled the statutory obligation.
Mr. Serjeant BYLx-The other side would contend that the board ought to put the burialground in such a state as to be fit for consecration, so as to satis the requirements of the bishop. The 85th canon said, "The churchwardens or questmen shall take care that the churchyards be well aud sufficiently repaired, fenced, and maintained with walls, rails, or pales, as have been in each place accustomed, at their charges unto whom by law the same appertaineth." The reason given was to keep out intruders. Here there were no churchwardens or questmen to whom the canon law could aply.
Mr. Justice CROmrxON.-You say this is not a churchyard at all.
Mlr. Justice WIGnrNiiMA, as we understood, said that cometcrium and churchyard were the same thing.
Lord C0iPBsLLL observed that if the Leislture willed it might over-ride the canon law.
MIr. Serjeant BYiE; contended that the ontward fence was sufliosent, and that the board had done more than they oere required. A gravel waLk and boundary stones wfould have been sufficient division, whereas the board had erected a stone wall 18 inches high.
Mr. COLLIBRt and Mr. IbnGDoa T followed on the same Ride.
Mr. efesrxe (in the absence of Sir F. Kelly) supported the rule. he said the euestion was whether a duty was imposed upon the board which whould induce the Court to grant a mnandamu, so that if there wcas any defence the hoard might make that defence in a return and the prosecutors might thea have an opportuntty of carrying the case to a higher tribunaL. Ths learned counsel then referred to the Cemetery Companie Act (the 10th and 11th of Victoria, cap. 65), which in the 23d section enacted that
"the bishop of the diocess inwrhieh the cemetery Is situatedl may on the applica tion of the company, consecrate any portion of the cemetery set apart for the burial of the dead according to the rites of the Established Church, if he be satisfied whith te title of the company to such portion, and thinks fit to consecrate such portion; and the part which is to be consecrated shall e be used only for burials according to the rites of the Established Church " The 24th section then enacted that " the company shall define by mistake marks the consecrated and unconsecrated portions of the cemetery." The learned counsel then proceeded to draw a distinction between that statute under which the company had a diseretion as to whether they should have the grounidconsecrated, and the acts now in question, which he contended bounsd the burial board to have the ground consecrated by the bishop. oe said his argument was, first, th thathere as no sufficient fence, and, secondly, that it was the duty of the board to have the ground consecrated, and only by the bihop could that be done.
Lord CAwt rhensh-You say the board are bound to do what the bishop may reqfure to be done.
Mrn. UtSL has said he did not say that, for if the bishop cted unreasonably and cairiiously the Cout woUnld not grant the mandamus. HIe (Mr. Karake) did not appear for the bishop, but for members of the Church of em nt - land at Tiverton, who were anxious to have the ground consecrated. He would show that the board were bound to have a fence, and that the bishop in exercising his discretion whether he should consecrate the groundvwas exercising a judicial act. Under the Cemetery Companies Act, to which he had already referred, the company rere not bound to harve the ground consecrated, nor whas the bihop bound to consecrate it unless he thognht fit. Under that statute the bishop also had a discret on as to other matters, for the 25th section enacted that "othe company shal build within the consecrated part of the ceaetery, and according to a plan approved by the bishop of the diocess, a chapel for the performance of the burial service according to the rites of the Established Church. So that, not only as to the consecration, but as to the kind of chapol to be built, the bishop woas constituted the sole judge. But b the 30th section of 15th and 16th of Victoria (incorporated with the 16th and 17th Victora wa.1L)i s enacted that" it shall be ladful for any burlalboard to lay out and embellish anye brialground provided by such board in such manner as my be fitting and proper, and to build on any land to be purchased or appropriated for a burialg,round under this act, and according to a p lan to be approved of by the bishop of the diocess, a chapel for the performance of the burial serniee according to the rites of the united church of E:ngland and Ireland; and such bnrialground may be eonsecrated by the bishop of the diocese when the same shall appear to him to be in a fit and proper condition for ths purposes of interment according to the rites of the united church; provided alwhays that in providing auy burial. ground such board shall set apart a portion thereof whioh shall not be so consecrated as aforesaid, and maybuild thereon a suitable chapel or chapels for the performance of funeral service." The 32d section!showedwhattbe effect of the consecration would be - the consecrated ground would thenceforth become the burial ground of the parlsh for which the same was provided. Then came the loth and 17th of Victoria, cap. 134, which, by tho 7th section "-provided that in all cases in which any burial board shall provide a new burialground under the said act, 15th and f6th of Victoria, cap. 85, or under this act, that new burialground shal be divided into consecrated and unconseorated parts in such proportions, and the unconsecrated part thereof shall be
allotted in such manner and in such portions, as may be sanctioned by one of Her Majesty's principal secre es of
State; and when any burial board sall, by virtue of section 30 of the said act, build on any burialground provided by such board a chapel for the performance of the burial service according to the rites of the united clurch of England and Ireland, they -hall also build, on the portion of suclh gronnd set apart for burials othervdse than aocording to the rites of the said church, such chapel accommodation for the performance of burial service by persons not being members of the said church as may be approved of by one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State."
Lord CA'rMrPBL.-That contemplates one burialground. MSr. KAtRSLAI;E said that under tho Cemetery Companies Act the bishop had a discretion, both as to consecrating the ground and also as to the chapel, and the company were not bound to have the ground consecrated. But under the latter statutes it was required that the burialground should be consecrated, and he contended that the bishop had jurisdiction to decide when it was in a fit state. The learned counsel then referred to Burn's Ecc. Law to show the forms of consecration, and that all churchyards should be fenced, and dwelt on the language of the 7th section of the 16th aud 17th of Victoria, cap. 134, which said that the " neow burialground shall be divided into consecrated and unconsecrated parts," which, he contended, imposed on the board the duty of getting it consecrated by doing whatever was necessary to that end. That wats the construction be (the learned counsel) put on the act. He contended that the act of the bishop was a judicial act.
Lord CAIIPnXLL-You may contend thatif it is smatter of doubt the maundatmu ought to go.
Mr. JUstice COLEMRDGE.-It is a question whetherwe can decide the matter on this i-ule.
Mr. KAPsLLAE said the Court would not do so, and he contended the prosecutors ought not to be be barred from puttiDg that construction upon the act for which he had contended.
Lord CAMIPB:ELL said a question of law was raised on the construction of the act of Parliament, whether the board

THE QUEE V. ]ANSELL.
Mr. F. RUSSELL said the prisoner, on whose pat he ijow appeared, had boen convicted on a charge of murder, and was now lying in prison under sentence of death. The sentenoo, however, bad been respited, in consequence of a writ of error having been sued out, by lexae of the Attorney. General, and, as the record was now in court, he moved that the asigninent of errors might be amended according to the facts, which were entirely undisputed. At the trial, before Mr. Baron Bramiwell, certin jurymen were challenei 'by the counsel for the Crown, on the ground of their bing supposed to entertain consdentious objections to capital punishments. These parties were all directed to " stand by." The panel having been exhausted, the officer of the court again began to call over the names in the panel, when one William Ironmonger, who bad been alreidy once challenged, was again told to " stand by." He (the larned counsel) as counsel for the prisoner ob. jected that the oounsel for the Crown could not adopt that course, but the juryman must either go into the box, or the counsel for the Crown must go on with his challenge The learned judge, however, decided that the juryman might be allowed to " tand by,, and ultimately a full nury w made up out of a jury who had retired to consider
erverdict, hut who came into court during the discwu. sion. In the assignment of errors It was allegedVat the juryman was directed to stand by "for a eanable time," and he (the learned counsel) feared it might ia disadvantage to the prisoner to sppear to be obNecting to that. Hle wished the words " for a reasonable tite" to be left out. He also wished to be llowed to argue that JMr. Baroa Bramwell ought not to have excused a jurvman on the ground that he had conscientious objections to capital punishments.
LOrd CAMPBELL said the Court would give no opinion as

COUlRT OF COMMfN PT.1?.AR W - r .
MARIOTT V. THE LONDON AND SOUTH-WETERN RAILWAY
(Sittingz in Banco, Hilary Tern, beforc Lord Chief Jus-
tiCC COCKBtiBN and JUStice CRLSSWELL, WILL&aIS, and ORowD1.Il
In this case MEr. BOV[LT, Q.C., and Mr, ILHwKms appeared to show cause against a rule cafllg on the defendants to show cause wby a writ of injunction should not issue against them calling on them to permit the applicant's omnibus at all reasonable times to ply for passengers at the Kingston Railway station, and to show cause why they should give any undue preference to another omnibus pro. pietor over the appHcant, under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act. The learned counsel contended that the defendants' station yard at Kingston was their private property, with a right of way across it to the hotel, and that the defendants had a right to exclude the applicant's omnibus from the station yard if they saw fit. The apphcation raised the question whether every omnibus proprietor might insist as a right to ply at every railway station for passengers, and carry passengers there if any omnibus was permitted to do so. If that right were conceded the consequonce would be that there would be no possibility of preserving good order and no security for tho luggage of passengers. Atpresent one omnibus was allowed to ply at the station subject to certain regulations; and if every omnibus were allowed the same privilege there wonld be no security, unseemly confusion, and quarrels. Even since this rule had been applied for a fight had -ken place in the xtation yard between the driver of one omnibus and the conductor of tho other, which had resulted in a broken leg to one of them. One was charging fourpenny fares and the other twopenny, and if this writ were granted the result would be that one conductor would seize one arm of a passenger, and the other the other arm, and there would be the greatest inconvenience and confusion. The company ha made arrangements with a man named Williams to supply all requisite omnibus acconi modation which should be necesay to and from the railway station to the town of Kingston. The object of the corm-
y ws that the pubho should at all times and by all trains Mve omnibus accommodation.
The CHIEF JUSTICX.-IS there not a great deal of traffic coming from other places than Kingston ? The applicant comes with his omnibus from Teddington.
Mr. BOILL.-The affidavit of the station manager showed that the omnibus accommodation provided by #il liams was perfectly sufficient for the public and that the agplicant's omnibus ran to Teddington in competition with the railway company, and that it was not required for the public accomm aion.
The CHzx.JuslciL-But what public? We cannot but know that there is a very large traffic at the Kingston station which is not either to or from the town of Bingston. Mr. Mariott says he supplies what Mr. Willams does notaccommodation to the public beyond Kingston.
Mr. Justice CRXSSWELL.-For a certain consideration the company granted Williams a mono oly, and unless they could show that doing so was reasonable under the circumstances with referenoe to the accommodation of the public, to the maintenance of order, and the security of property within the railwaystation yard, their doing so would be "an undue preference," and within the prohibition of the statute.
Mr. Justice CuowD-na.-Your affidavit shows that no other public but the Kingston public wants to be accommnodated.
Mr. BOVILL-There has never been any complaint of want of accommodation, and by the arrangement the company have made they secure accommodation for the public always, by all the trains.
The CHxv Jusn'cz.-Do you show aDy reason why the public will not be quite as well or better provided for by eaving the omnibus accommodation open for pubhc oompetition rather than by granting a monopoly I don't know any monopoly that might not be defended on the same grounds that you urge, that the person having it should always have a supply equal to the demand.
MLr. JuStice COESSWVXLL.-And with regard to your point as to the possible confusion if other omnibuses were allowed to pley atthe station, it is only shown that two omnibuses
driv to teYard.
Mr. Justice CuOV DXn.-If more cannot get a profit, do you think persons wiU drive omnibuses there for their amusement?
Mr. BoviLL.-If it should be decided that Mr. Alariott was to have All the advantages of plying at the station yard without being subject to the arrangements of the company he would then be able to afford to undersell Williams. He now could afford to drive for 2d., while Williams charged 4d.
The CsHMx J.usTvc&-It may be that if Mr. Williams reduced his price he would get lenty of customers The present arrangement seems to be bod for the public, and to b an unreasonable arrangement. Under oertain reasonable regulations competition is a very wholesome prinoiple. Kingston is but a very small portion of the publc of that vicinity. If the company have plenty of roomintheir yard there is no reason why other omnibuses should not pl to their station rather tha put pengers down-possibl
ladies, and in the wet-outside the gates 75 yards 2ron the station. The public are sufferers such an arrsngement and it does not afford "reasonable fcilitiee totheVnblic as required by the statute.
Mr. BovILx.-I can only present the facts as they are. The company have made an arrangement with Williams to supply omnibuses subject to their regulations, tho 6b3ect being to secure accommodation2fr por eners byall he trains. Without such an arrngement possa'ble the oninibusses w;ould only ply at the trains which were Ia1clyto pay
Ifthis rule were granted, the effect wrould be to give M\anotit a monopoly, a s he could then unadersell WIlliams, who ,was under arrangements with tbme company.
IThe Cuixy JUSrICx-It is quite competent for the comn-
pany, if this decision is against them, to release Williams from his obligation.
Mr. Lush and Mr. Quain were not called uron to support the rutle.
The CQpR JusrCs, in giving judgment, said we think you are entitled to a rule in this case. We are of opinion that this rule should be made absolute. It seems the London and South-Western Rilway Company have made an arrangement whereby they admit-within the doors of the station the omnibus belonging to Williams and exclude all others. The effect is that while Williams conveys passengers and traffic only from Kingston, another omnibus bringing passengers ana goods from Teddington, Hampton-wick. aud other places is excluded from coming within the immediate precincts of the railway, and passengers and goods are subjected to the inconvenience of having to be brought from the gates of the yard to the station. We are of opinion that that is givizan unreasonable preference and advantage in favour of illiams, and that the company are within the provisions of this act of Parliament. I can see no reason why this preference should be given to one omnibus over another, I can understand that there may be cases where, from want of space, a company can only admit a certain number of carriages to compete for the railway traffic. There is nothing of that kind here. It is said that the cornpany by this arrangement secure a constant supply of omnibuses to the public. But in the first place the company don't show any eircumstances from which the Court can reasonably infer that, in the absence of such an arrangement, omnibus accommodation would not be suap plied, even as regards the Kingston public. In the second place, assuming that this arrangement may be convenient to the pnblic of Kingston, it does not apply to the rest of the pu lic. Looking at all the eircumstances, it does not appear to us that any public benefit arises to justify such
an arrangement; on the contrary, the blance of inconvenience is against as resulting from such an arrangement. This case comes within the terms of the act of ParlAment, as a case of undue and unreasonable preference and advantage given, without any corresponding benefit to the publie to justify it. We ought to make this rule absolute -that ' to say, absolute to the extent that the company shall aeiit the omnibus of Mariott into the station yr, for the purpose of delivering the passengers and traffic, in the same manner and to the same extent as other public vehicles are admitted into their yard; but the rest of the rnle'should be omitted.
The other learned jxdges concurred in this judgment, fr. Justice WlLwAms saying the Court must not be understood as laying down a general rale. This case was decided on its particular circumstances.

CATrEsIaoLE V. nODGSON.
Mr. EDwL-T JÂ£aunS said he appeared for the attorneys alluded to in this rale, which was granted yesterday at the instance of the plaintiff, and a report of which appeared in The Times of to-day (Friday). Se was instracted by these gentlemen, who were highly respectable city attorneys, to state that until they saw that report this morning they were ignorant of the contract alleged to have bean entered into by their clerk with respect to the terms on which the action should be carried on. As soon as they had seen the report in question they had made inquiries which satisfied them that their derk had most improperly entered into the alleged contraet ; ad. though the rule had not been served, they had at once instructed him (Mr. James) to come before the Court, and disclaim all participation with their clerk. The Court had only granted a rule, calling on the gentlemen in question to refund the sum of 501., but they felt so strongly on the subject that they were ready and anxious to pay over to the plaintiff the whole sum received by them under the award of the late Mr, Baron Alderson. He had communicated with his friend, Mr. Cole, who had behaved in the handsomest manner on the subject.
Mr. CoLs expressed his readiness to adopt any course which the Court might suggest
Mr. Baron MAnTLI.t-The conduct of these gentlemen is exceedingly handsome.
MIr. COLE felt tha' such might be the result of the application, and had therefore purposely omitted their names
The CHIFx BARoN.-It seems that some doubt was thrown on the justice of the proceedings on the part of the late Mr. Baron Alderson.
Mr. COLE.-That was in a letter purporting to come from these gentlemen, but wfhich I now understand them to deny as a forgery, and, nO doubt, written by their clerk.
MIr. Baron M.u'TIN.-It is right that that matter should be set right. His Lordship then conferred with the Chief Baron.
The CHEF BAIIox then said, with great emotion.-At the moment that the public are suffering the loss of the services of that eminent judge, and the Court and each individual member are feeling the deepest sorrow for the ycersonal loss which they have each sustained, it is pa=ul to hear from any quarter that this eminent person has ever acted unjustly, and without that pure sense of justice which Ibelieve every man knew him to possess. Few men upon the bench have ever brought more learning to it, and no man ever brought mote uprightness to the discharge of his public duties.
Mr. JA.iES.-In this case the late Mr. Baron Alderson sent for the counsel on each side, and gave, I mnst say, a most equitable decision, and it was treated as satisfactory to both parties.
Mr. Baron MARTLN.-It was a strictly equitable one, because the person in whose favour he gave the 1601. had no legal claim for the money, and when the matter was discassed for a new trial Mr. James, who anpeared for the plaintiff, aud knew it was a grievous and hard case, and that his client had no legal right, consented that Mr. Baron Alderson should say what should be done as a matter more of charity than anything else. The result was the statement that Mr. Baron Alderson had given to that individual money more as an act of charity than otherwise, and had made a verv unjust decision. This shows how careful judges should be in doing more than decide strictly on the matter of law brought before them, for the intention to do an act of kindness is often misunderstood and misrepresented.
Mr. COLE.-I hope your Lordships understand that the imputation was conveyed in a letter purporting to come from these gentlemen, but which they now deny aU know. ledee of. The rule will therefore be absolute, I presume.
Mr. JANmcE.-It will be better, perhaps, that the rule shonld not be made absolute, but be aIllowed to drop, and I will undertake that the money shall be paid to the plaintiff to-morrow.
Mr. COLE expressed himself satisfied with this offer, and the subject dropped.

THIS InLEXIBLE.-OBJECIION TO REPORT OF REGISTRAR
AND MERCHANrM.
(Before Dr. LuSimrGTOIZ.)
this was origina31y a ca-se of collision promoted by the Soubahdar against Her Majesty's ship Tnflexible. The Court, aided by Elder Brethren of the Trinity Corporation, came to the conolusion that the Inflexible was the wrongdoer, and referred the ease to the registrar aud merchants to ascertain the amount of the damage. A claim was made by tbe owners of the Soubabdar, amounting to 4,616l. 8s. 5d., which was reduced by the registrar and merchants to 3,1331. 18s. 4d., the principal item being a deduction of 882ie 18s. 6d. under the head of demurrage. The other items consisted mainly of rednctions from tradesmen's bills.
Dr. ADDAMS and Dr. Twiss were heard in opposition to the report; the QuxsN's ADVOCAkT and the ADMIRALTY ADVOCATE in its support.
The Court reserved its judgment.
THE BARTLEY.-SALVAGE.
This was a suit promoted by the steamship Sampson, the master of the Ramsgate lifeboat, and three Iuggers to procure salvage compensation for services rendered to the brng Bartlepn the 24th of September last. A second action was emivred by some boatmen who boarded the brig at a late perif of the service. The brig, of the burden of 189 tons. partly laden with timber, in proceeding from Southampton to Sunderland, got upon the south part of the Goodwin Sand, as adleged by tbe salvors, in a very dangerous pmition Ta;r-barrels were burned and guns fired to attract attention. These were responded to by the salvor5, who, as they said, at great risk to their lives, succeeded in reaching the brig, which, after much labour on their part, was condgted to Ilamegate harbour. On the part of the owfners it was contended that the vessel eamne off by the rising of the 'dood tide, and not by the exertions of the salvors. Zfle first 8et of satlvoro submitted that there was no occasion for the interference of the second set, they beingfully adequate to rescue the brig, The value of the property salved was
1,2501. 'and a tender was made of 2501., which the sa1vorI redecteo.
rDr. Jenner and Dr. Swabey appeared for the first met of salvors; Dr. Addams for,the second; Dr. Bayford and Dr. Spinks for the owners.
The learned JUDGZ considered that the second set of salvors were entitled to be rewarded. The tender was insufficient - there had not been the savin of property only, but, in iV probability of life, for which, under the MIerchant Shippin Act, the Court had the power of rewarding the parties. ! e would decree 4001., with costs.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Jan. 30

IN RE BAINRREnv AN -.-
(Bejore Mr. Com74WoW EVAN'A
The banrpts were boot and shoe makers of Sonthwarkbridge-road. his was an adjourned examination meeting.
Mr. Turner appeared for the assignees, and Mr. Bagley for DelL.
Many of the leading facts of the case have already appeared in The Times.
It appeared from the further examination of Dell to-day that he was fornerly in the ironmonger trade in Charlesstreet, Camden-town, and afterwards the proprietor of the Napoleon Stores, in John-street, Golden-square. He had been once bankrupt, and did not know whether any dividend hid been paid. Afterwards he had been an insolvent, when he was remanded 15 months. In January, 1856, he had a capital of 2001., but he owed 700L or 8001. After that time he had joined Bainbridge in commencing the business in the shoe trade. Did not know Bainbridge until two or three months before the partnership oommenced, Had told Bainhridge that he could find money to meet, all payments, but had not told him that he could bring in 1,000. a-month. An account wias opened at the Royal British Bank in Bainbridge's name. lie supposed Bainbridge went to America for a change of air. (Laughter.) When Bainbridge was at various places he 'had visited him and given him money. If inquiries were made after Bainbridge he gave evasive answaers. When he charged Bainbride with drawing 1,2001. ont of the business he thought Bainbridge would keepaway. WhenBainbridge returned from America, he saw him the Sunday before he surrendered at the King's-cross station Coffeehouse. He did not tell Bainbridge that the assignees had a warrant out for his apprehension. He caUed Bainbridgo anything but a gentleman for returning without letting hit know that he meant to come back, so that he could prepare his balance. sheet properly. (A laugh.) Bainbridge regretted what had occurred, and said that he was going back to Philadelphia, hut he wished to take his wife and family with him. He borrowed 101. for Bainbridge on his watch, chain, and diamond ring, and he left again for Liverpool. Bainbridge gave him the watch and ring-he was scarcely sober, but not so drank as he had seen him. (A laugh.) It was difficult to tell when he was drunk or sober. The next time he heard of Bainbridge was that he had surrendered to the bankruptey. He had since hadlmost daily interviews with him, but had not offered him money to go to Germany. He. had not said to Mr. Wake, the traveller of Mr. Smith, "If you are examined, give the same version as I have given." The check produced for 1101., and several others, h been drawn npon the RoyalBritish Bank. It was payable to Mr. Samuels. That was a fictitious narme. Samuels was a general dealer, residing at No. 1, Harriaon-place, Gray'sinn-road. The money received for this check had been applied to the payment of hills.
After much other evidence,
lIr. TURNEPX pro sed to adjourn Dell sinc die. Bain bridge had given uable informatioR, and the assignees were willing that his examination should be adjonrnedJ for one month, with protection.
A warm discussion ensued, and ultimately
His HoNouR ordered a further adjournment of Dell's examinatiou,with protection for one month only.
It maybe recollected that in this case the tradine ex. tended only a very few months, that the goods purchased were sold at ra loss, and that at the bankruptcy the debts w ere several thousand pounds, and the assets next to none.
IN RE SEACOLE AND DAY.
The bankrupts were rovision merchants and the proprietors of stores at Balaklava. They were now granted certificates of the first class.
A Spectator.-Of what class are the certificates?
Mrs. Seacole.-What class? First, to be sure ! Am I not a first class woman? (Great laughter.)
(Before Mr. Commissioner HoLRoYD.)

The bankrupt was a dealer in embossing presses, of Brighton, and counected with several insurance compamles.

Mr. Linklater appeared for the assignees; Mr. Lawrance for the executors of Mr. Whittingstall, and Mr. Murray for the bankrupt.

Mr. LINKLATER said that on the 13th of March, 1856, Whittingstall died, and on the last occasion, as solictor to this estate, he asked for an adjournment in order that Smith might furnish an account of his dealings between himself and Whittingstall up to the time of the death of the latter, and also the dealings of the bank since that event. He (Mr. Lirkater) had to congratulate himself that he had done so, as it would now appear that the executors were clearly debtors, and not creditors, to the estate.
Mr. LA wRAXcE thought it would be better to have a private meeting out of court, and discuss these matters.
or his own part, he had not vet seen a figure of the sup plemental accounts, and he was desirous of looking into the law of tshe case, and discussing it with his friend, with the view of ascertaining whether the executors of Whittingstall are debtors or creditors, or not.
The CoNnussiolmR, said he could net see any possible objection to the niceties of the case being discussed m private before they were argued in public.
Mr. LiNSLATER said he was misunderstood. Hlewas now applying himself to the object of the day's sittingnamely, the passing of the examination of the bankrupt. All he was desirous of doing was to draw the attention of the Court to the balance-sheet which had been rendered since the last meeting upon his requisition. He understood that his friend withdrew his claim to enable the bankrupt to furnish further accounts, It appeared bythe liquidation account now furnished that at the death of Whittingstall Smith and Whittingstall owed 84,0001., and that the assets were only 58,6831., so that at that time the hank was insolvent to the extent of 26,0001. It also appeared that the directors gave directions to the marnager from March, when Whittingstall died, down to August, when Smith became bankrupt. During this period they permitted notes to go out bearing the names of Whittingstall and Smith and there were now above 6,0001. of those notes in circulation. Negotiatio,s for disposing of the business by the executors failed,'and since the death of WhittinesteU, at which time the liabilities of the bank were 6842L Smith had pnaid 35,7041., so that Smith had paid more than the firm of Smith and WhittingstaU by 32,0001. It was this sum that was in dispute, and he thought it was very hard upon the depositors, who had invested their money upon the faith that Whittingstall's estate was liable, that the executors should deny their liability, and that they (the depositors) should only receive about half-a-crown in the pound. He believed that many of the customers of the
ank would not have deposited a single shilling in it if they had entertained the slightest doubt that WhittingsItall's estate was liable. He had thought it better that the figures should be placed in thebalance-sheet, with the view, if posible, of avoiding litigation and expensive Chancery suits. The assignees did not object to Mr. Smith passing his examination, with the exception that he practised as a solicitor in partnership with a Mr. Grover, and he alleged there was a balance of from 4,0001. to 5,0001. due to him from the firm, and they wished a detailed account of the partnership before the certificate meeting.
Mr. MURRAY thought Mr. Linklater was reallv pressing too hard upon Mr. Smith. All the bills of costiswere entered in the books, and an estimate of them carried into the balance-sheet.
The bankrupt said the assignees had sold all his books and papers and what they termed goodwil of his business to AMr. Grover, and he had no right to touch a single paper in Mr. Grover's office.
The ComAIrssioNER said the bankrupt was bound to furnish his assignees with any information they required.
The bankrupt replied that he could not devote the whole of his time to the assignees, and he was afflicted six hours per day and three hours every night with asthma.
His HO2OuR said he must pledge himself to render reasonable assistance, which having been done he pased his examination and received renewed protection until the certificate meeting, which was fixed for the 28th of March next at 11 o'clock.
I RBE BA}EP. AND AQUIA.
The bankrupts were cement manufacturers, of MillwaU, trading as Gadesaen and Co.
Mr. CHDLEY applied on their behalf for certificates of the second class. They had possessed capital, and they bad had heavy losses, including one of upwards of 2,0001. by the realization of tne above works.
Mr. PIMSTOIS, for the assignees, did not object.
His HoiNous looked through the prnceedings, and said be could not_go beyond a common certificate,
Third class certificate accordingly.

able character, were chrrged with being concerned In the. followiun robbery.
A gentleman nAmed Guyenerch, or Guyenecke- residing in Burv-street, St. James's, who has recently come over from iermany and can speak nothing but German, had business at the Docks, and as the nearest road home took bis way through SpitalMields. On reaching Keate-street, one of the most notorious atreets in it, he was accosted by Beckett and Stephens, who contrived to induce him to enter one of the houses, and as soon as he had done so he found himself set upon by a number of women, some of whom firmly hdd him while the others fist robbed him of his watec and chain, and then, turning out all his pockets, emptied their contents into their hands. The women then tried to escape, and the German tried to gtop tbem, but was intercepted by a man in the passage, abu=ed7 and challenged to fight, and ept employed and exasperated in this manner till all the women had got away, and when this object had been accomplished he was thrust out into the street. The prosecutor soon commanicated his loss to another German, who went with him to the stationhouse to give Information to the police, the result of which was that Beckett and Stephens were soon taken, but neither the property nor Hunt and Halliford could be heard of till several nights afterwards, when a constable of the H division was on duty in the same neighbourhood, and, hearing a quarrel between two women, was induced to listen to their mutu acousations4 and in the course of them heard Hunt accuse Halliford of defrauding her of her share of a stolen watch. This was just what he wanted toknow, and the women continued their quarrel, when Hunt happened to suddenly turn round, nd, seeing that he had been an uninvited listener, at once gaveherself up for participating in the robbery of the watch, which she said had been given to Halliford to sel, and that she had done so, but appropriated the wholeproceeds to her own purposes. Halliford admitted her recelpt of the watch and chain, and also of the other property stolen from the German, but denied havin

Charles Meyers, clockmaker, 73, Union-street, said he was hanging up a clock about half-past 9 o'clock on the previous night behind the counter, when he heard one of the squares in the prosecutor's windows smash, and on looking round he saw a man's hand through seizing a watch, which he ran off with. Witness inimediately ran out of the shop and saw a few minutes afterwards the prisoner, who was brought back to the shop, and his left hand was bleeding. Witness did not see the man's face; but he knew it was his left hand that was put through the square. He sent for the prosocutor, who gave him into custody, but the watch was not found on him.
William Gooding said he was passing the Roebuck Tavern. in tnion-street, at about half-past 9 o'clock, when he saw the prisoner rumning from the direction of the prosecutor's shop, and, hearing cries of "Stop thief r" he pursued him into Ewer-street, where he succeeded in capturing him, and after a great deal of struggling he detained him until a constable came up, when he assisted in taking him to the prosecutor's shop. His left hand was bleeding, apparently from a cut inflicted with glass.
The prsoner, who denied having broken the window or stealing the watch, wfas fully committed for trial.
Charles Arundel, a middle-aged man of rather resIectable appearance, who stated himself to have formerlybeen an officer in the 3d Dragoon Guards, was charged with committing an assault on Mary Sessions, a young woman with whom e had been living for some time.
The complainant, who exhibited a black eye and a cut on the nose, said that they resided in Long-lane, Berinondsey, and on the previous night they liad a quarrel in the street. She was remonstrating with him at the door of a publichouse when he struck her two blows, one on the right eye and the second time on the nose. She bled very much, and, meeting with a constable, she gave him into custody. She was rather under the influence of liquor at the time, but she gave him no provocation.
The prisoner denied having ssaulted her. He was too much of a gentleman for that, although he was now in very reduced circumstances depending on his friends in the 2?orth for the means of support. He had been in the 3d Dragoon Guards, and had latterly lost about 13,000L in business.
The co?mplainant swore positively as to his assaultiug her, but she no wish to njure him provided he was held to bail to keep the peace.
The prisoner said he should not like to send to his friends for bail, as they were in a high position; however, he could assure his worship he did not assault her.
Mr. Cozmx said that from her appearance there could be no doubt as to the na,ture of the assault, and he should not be doing his duty to t publicunless he punished him with some severity. In fact, the recent act of Parliament for the protection of women was imperative. He should sentence him to three months' hard labour at Wandsworth.
The prisoner was then removed, while the complainant implored his worship not to send him to prison.
The magistrate has received a check for 51., dated the 24th inst., from "Heury B. H,*" and 3L. from "J. G.," for the poorbox of this court, with a request of an acknowledgment in thisier

The Irish Encumbered Estates Court.
THE IRISH ENCUMfBERED ESTATES COUBT.
TO THE EDITOP OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The Izish intelligence column in your paper has already informed the public of the very great inconvenienco isutained by those persons whose interests are affected by the Encumbered Estates Court through the sudden removal of Baron 8ichards.
I am one of many sufferers. A portion of my property was sold in the autumn, the purchase money was lodged and the final schedule prepared ; all was ready for paying off the several claims on the 29th of November.
Since then everything hae been at a stand. The persons entitled to receive the aaount of their respective charges are losers to a oDnsiderable extent by the delay; on the other hand, I, the owner and petitioner in the cause, am under interest at 6 per cent. ipon these unpaid claims, while the purchase money is lying unproductive in the Bank of Ireland. The loss is very serious to me. A large sum will be thus absorbed, and the surplus to which I am entitled is daily diminishing.
I Am now told bynmysolicitor thatat the presentadvanced stage of affairs a day would suffice to wind up the accounts and lihberate me from expense and liability if there was a commisrsoner to sanction the proceedings.
Several persons are similarly circumstanced and equally inconvenienced by this interregnuan; family arrangenents, deeds, settlements, aIike suspended, while the two rerm inng co2moners, Loantgfio ad y aye, exhatd otehd
y the weight of their own hare o usmess, positively retuse to undertake any cause previously under the jurisdition of Baron lichards-and these causes number 70, all of which are aIdd aside.
What redress is there ? I trust that by representinlg the matter in l2he Times attention may be directed to the hardship and loss whichpresa so heavily on the petitioners to the E:ncumbered Court, and some authori7ed commiasioner, judge, or legal oflicer, be appointed to wind up those cases left incomplete by the removal of Baron Richards. The sooner the grievance can be remedied the better for a numerous and somewhat unfortunate Class to which I have the sorrow to belong-the owners and petitioners to tbe Encumbered Estates Court. Yours obedient.

Machinery In Our Arsenals.-On Wednesday
i.ACHNErY I oUR ARszEwAs.-On Wednesday night, at the weekly meeting of the Society of Arts, the paper read was " On the application of Machinery in the war Department" by Mr. John Anderson, Inspector of Machinery, Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. During the last few years important improvements have been made in the, manufactories of the War Department. There are now 68 steam-engines with a nominsl power equal to 1,170 horses, giving motion to 16,540 feet of shaftfg 1S steam hammers, and 2,773 machines of various desrlph1onL When the several works now in proreas are completed the Government vill be able to supply munitions of war in such abundant profusion as shall be equal to the sudden requirements of of any armament they may deem necessary to equip. A manufactory had been erected capable of producing 1,000 muskets per week. As to the bayonet, it undergoes 76 operations, each of which is definite and simple, and at the conclusion the several bayonets are as mach alike as the several pieces of money from the Mint, ana present a degree of accuracy which could not be eluaUed, even at three times the cost, by the tools or apparatus which have hitherto been employed in England. The gun-stock, which from the irregularity of its form presents unusual difficulties, has been produced with the greatest perfection, involving about 20 operations. An entirely self-acting apparatus has een erected, capable of producing 500 1M6 balls per rninute. The improvements in the manufacture of cartridges were then described, particularly the introduction of the method of maing seamless bags of paper direct from the pulp. Passing to aother class of apparatua,-that for the production of shels and fusees-fr. Anderson said that in 1854, the demand for ordinary cast-iron sheUs having been extremely urgent, it was considered advisable toerect a model foundry, which answered its purpose so well that a larger one was ultimately erected, capable of delivering 200 tons of shot and shel daily, if such should ever be required. In one day of 24 hours, during the late war, upwards of 10,400 shels passed through this machinery, a feat which probably could not have been accomplished in any other workshop in the world. The factory for wrought-iron sbells, which is capable of producing 100 daily, was erected in two months durng the severe winter of 1854-5, and the overations are effected with tle utmost economy of labour. -After touching upon the manufacture of the wooden sabots and the fusees for shells, Mr. Anderson passed to that of war rockets. for which a plant of machinery was being erected capable of
roducing o500 dail A foundry car able of producing five neavyirongnus daily hs been erected. A brief description was then given of the floating factoy which was sent out to Balaklava, and Mr. Anderson concluded by mentioning several of the miscellaneous and important works that had been lately carried out by the War Department.
d srT OLD BLACK Boy, CHEIUNSFORD.-OnWednesday the Old Black Boy, Chelmsford, which for between three *nd four centuries stood as a noted hostel on the Essexroad, and with which, from the scenes that have passed and the guests who have rested there, historical associations were connected, was put up for public sale, and is literaUy to be knocked down, as the hammer of Messrs Beadell, Son, and Chancellor is to be followved by the crowbar and pickaxe of the purchasers. The materials of this ancient imn, which most of our readers are aware has been closed for some time, the rail having fairly run it off the road, were offered in lots, and the sale drew together, for the last time, a goodly assembly in the large room, which has held many a gay and joyous gathering, most of those present coming
rbusness, but a few, no doubt, attracted by antiquarian interest. The whole was divided into 120 lots, and thouLgh some of the materials are more than 3 0 years old, -the ceiling of the comnmercial room, for instance, which contains some curions carvings, having, it is believed, stood nearly four centaries-much of it will no doubt be found usefal for modern purposes. The lead upon the building fetched 7&!. 10g., and the whole realized upwards of 2601. The Black Boy will thus in A short time be swept away, and thme site will no doubt be occupied with buildings mnre in accordance with modern requirements and taste.-C7hdmsfordZ Chroiclde.

That if no exception be taken the five names standing first on the list, or the first five free from exception, be a committee o' inquiry whether misconduct has taken place; these having power to summon and examine witnesses, due notice being given to the accused, and the proceedings being open 3. That the archdeacon, not being the accuser, if named by the bishop, shall not have his name struck off. 4. That the chancellor of the diocess or his deputy, named in wvriting by him with the bishop's consent, be present at each inquiry. 5. That henceforth diocesan chancellors be appointed from advocates of at least seven years' standing in the ecclesiastical courts. 6.

Mr. F. Peel, M.P., On The Income-Tax.
MP. F. PBEL, M.P., OX TEHE IXYCOhMETAX.
A crowded meeting was held at the Albion Hotel, Bury (Lancashire), on Thursday evening, "for the purpos of considering the propriety of petitioning Parliament for a reduction of the income and property tax, and a more equitable and economical plan of assessing and levying the same." Mr. Richard Walk-er occupied the chair. Resolutions were passed, expressive of the opinion of the meeting that the additional 9d. in the pound should cease at the 5th of April next, and condemning the principle and general operation of the tax.
Mr. F. PEmTn, ALP., on rising, was received with loud cheers. After some introductory observations he said,-We are dealing with an income-tax of 16d. in the pound, and so great is the wealth of this country, so general is the diffnsion of that wealth, so large is our population, and so many andsovariousthe classes that contribute, so easy the collection, I must say, and so prompt thepayment, that an incometax of that rate brings into the Exchequer of this country a sum of no less than 16,000, 0001. of revenue, and at this moment weareunder the imposition of a taxwhich isadding to our revenueatthe rateto which I have referred. Now, gentlemen, it is obvious, from the remarks which I have heard, that you entertain grave and serious objections to many arrangements connected with the amount, the imposition, the constitution, and the mode of assessment and collection of this tax. It is clear that these views have not been hastily adopted by you, and I think it redounds to your hononr that I, at least till this evening, was not aware that you had ever before given expression to these objections. And why? Because you knew the Government of this country and the people of this country had been engaged in an arduous and severe struggle with a great empire. (Cheers.) And you knew that if the Government was to conduct that war in accordance with your own desires, with energy and enterprise, it was necessary you should furnish it with the means of doing so, and that there were no means so ready for the purpose as the imposition of this income-tax. I believe therefore that you have abstained till now from raising these objections, becauseyon did not desire to impair the fruitfulness and the productiveness of that tax by starting objections which would go to impair its efficiency, and to undermine, and possibly to render impossible, its maintenance. I say that this abstinence does you great credit, and entitles you, now that the war is over, when the pressure is taken off, when we have time to draw in our breath and survey our position-it entitles you now, when you state in calm and moderate expression the objections that you entertain to this tax, not onlyto a patient, but toan indulgent and most attentive hearing. I enter fully into your feelings with regard to the first resolution that has been submitted this evening. The question may be presented to you in this way :-You consented, when war broke out, to the income-tax being doubled; your object in agreeing to that measure was that the expenses of the war might be provided without resorting to that expedient of borrowing money the facile exercise of which in times past and in previous wars had aecumulated a load of debt which has cost us, and which will cost our descendants after us, so dearly. (Cheers.) You know, f urther, that when the war is over-and although you may remove your armies and fleets from the scene of operation, although you may bring your forces home and disband them and send them to their respective homes, although you may stop the flow of fresh expenditure-you know perfectly well that after a war is over, it is then that the expenses and charges are presented for final settlement and adjustment; and that therefore for a certain period after the termination of a great struggle the expenditure of the country must be proceeding at an almost undiminished rate, in order that those expenses and outstanding charges may be
adjusted. Therefore it was you consented that this duplication of a rate at which the income-tax had been previously assessed should be continued for a certain period after the war, and you concluded that a period of 12 months would suffice for that purpose. You know that 12 months have expired since the treaty of peace was concluded, and therefore it is that you now urge that, irrespective of the language of any act of Parliament-irrespective of the position which, in virtue of that act of Parliament, the Government may stand in-they shall forego the continuance of the tax at that rate, and shall be content to return to the rate which existed prior to the commencement of the war. ("lHear," and cheers.) Now, gentlemen, when the financial statement of 1853 was presented the Chancellor of the Exchequer at that time anticipated the early termination of the incometax. He fLxed as the limit to it the year 1860, and he proposed that the rates at which the income-tax should be levied in the interval between the year 1853 and the year 1860 should be reduced by a graduated scale according to certain periods of years within that interval. Under that arrangement, if that arrangement had subsisted, the incometax from the 1st of April this year to the 1st of April, 1860, would only have been 5d. in the pound, and in April, 1860, it would have terminated altogether. (Hear.) No one at that time foresaw the storm which was gathering in the North-no one saw or knew how near was the approach of the calamity which was then impending; but war followed, and when war broke out a new arrangement was made with regard to the income-tax, and in the year 1854 the income-tax was doubled, and it was then enacted and provided by the law that the double rate of tax should continue for a year after the treaty of peaco. And if that had been all the enactment of the law upon the subject your views would have prevailed without any question whatever, and in the month of April of this year the incometax would have returned to the rate at which it was before. Y ou knew, however, that after our army had been landed in the Crimea, and after we had lost some ground in the course of the first winter, and there had been miscarriages and misadventures, it was necessary to make increased exertions, and therefore it was in the month c - .ipril, 1855, that a further addition was made to the income-tax. It was raised from 14d. to 16d. in the pound, and then it was provided that there should not only be an addition of 2d. in the pound, but that the previous addition of 7d. should continue, not as had been in the first instance provided-not for a year after the conclusion of the treaty of peace, but for the
riod of a year which should commence to be reckoned rom that month of April which should first follow after the conclusion of the treaty of peace. That 1st of April will be the April of the present year, and the year for which the income-tax was intended to continue was to be the year which commences to run from the April in this year. That is the legal state of the question. You have urged, and properly so, that no advantage should be taken of this position. (Hear, hear.) You think that a year is sufficient for the continuance of this war rate of income-tax to wind up all outstanding accounts and charges, and your wish in this respect has been fortunately anticipated by the Government. (Cheers.) In regard to the question that it was necessary that you should urge the Government to the course that it is proposed to take, the Obancellor of the Exchequer has stated that it never entered his mind to take advantage of that act of Parliament, and that he never contemplated continuing the rate at which the income-tax should be assessed at ls. 4d. in the pound beyond the lst of April this year, and that if it were necessary that it should be continued he would give ample opportunity to the public and to Parliament to exercise their own discretion upon the subject, either to grant or withhold it as they might then think best for the public service. Therefore, as regards that portion of the first resolution, we are in effret entirely in accordance. But that resolution goes on to a further proposition. It recommends that the rate at which the Income-tax should be levied from the 1st of April in this year shall be reduced to what it was before the war. (Hear, hear.) The question-Shall there be a reduction of taxation, and shall that reduction be made by redacing this particular tax, cannot be answered, as has been very properly surmised by one speaker, until we have ascertained the answer to be given to another question, which is this-Will the expenditure be reduced, and to what extent? That is really the question upon which the wholc turns, and in regard to that matter our minds have been set at rest by the official statement which has been made by a leading member of the Government. The noble lord at the head of the War Department has stated that the army estimates for the coming year will be less than they were in the first instance last year by no less a sum than 20 millions of money. (Applause.) Last year when the army estimates were first submitted to Parliament they amounted to 34 millions of money. If you reduce that sum by 20 mniiions it follows that the army estimates of the coming year will not exceed 14 milions of money. (Hear, hear.) I know not whether there will be a corresponding reduction in the naval estimates, but that there will be a reduction may be reckoned uipon with certainty, and, as the Chancellor of the EKchequer has stated that the expenditure of the countr-3- is mainly measured by the expenditure for the army and naval services, we have an answer to that preliminary question, a satisfactory answer, that the expenditure of the country will he greatly reduced; and, as that iS the case, I agree with you that as expenditure is reduced, as taxation can be remitted, the remission of that taxation should fall upon that tax which was specially raised for the purpose of bearing the extraordinary expenses of the last two or three years. (Cheers.) Gentlemnen, the second
Os your resolutions deals with tho subject in a more general way. You desire to reconstruct the tax. You say, I think, that a distinction ought to be made between permanent and precarious incomes. You think that if one rate is levied upon permanent incomes another and a lower rate ought to be levied upon precarious incomes. (Hear, hear.) Now, this is a very difficult question, and if notice is to be paid to the opinions of men who have studied this question very deeply, if attention is due to those who have spoken and written upon this subject with authority, there are difficulties in the way of giving effecs to your desires which by no means are easy to surmount. I don't myself pretend to have any positive and decided opinion upon this subject; my object in coming here was to ascertain what your views were, but I will state to you what are some of the objections that have been made froma time to time with regard to establishing a difference of rating in respect to these two classes of permanent and precarious property. It has been asked in what consists the difference between pennanentand precariousincomes. Isitnotinrespect of their durability ? The income from permanent property will be the same ten years hence as it is now, with very little trouble on the part of its possessor, while the income derived from property that is invested in commercial or mercantile speculations is due only in part to the possession of capital, hut mainly to the skill and personal inteligence and ability of its possessor. But then it has been said that the income that is raised in the course of a year is spent in the course of that year in the service upon which the money is raised, is spent in services which are of a permanent character, and the interest which persons have in the
roper conduct of this service may fairly be measured y the income which they receive for that year. That ms one of the arguments that has been used against the establishment of any distinction between these kinds of property. Do you recollect the epeech made in 1853 by the
ancelor ofthe Exchequerat thattime? At thattime there had been a great agitation upon tbis very question, whl9h had proceeded to greahr lengths than now. Jg
mnade a speech on this subject unparaaUeled or unsurpassed for eloquence, range, and lucidity. And from the time t*hat he delivered that speech the agitation ceased and oppaition was abandoned-and why? Because he showed tiat under the Income-tax, as at present levied, although not nominally, yetvirtnaly that very distinction exists which yon seek to establish, ana ne asserted and proved that now, in the way in which tho tax is at present levied if precarious incomes contribute to the lncome-tax at the rate of 7d. in the pound, incomes of a permanent character contribute at the rate of 9d. in the pound, and he asserted that those who had argued for the establishment of a difference between these two kinds of property had never contended for a greater difference than is represented by the figures 7 and 9. He showeed that this distinction existed inasmuch as while in the case of precarious incomes allowances of every kind were permitted to be made, in the case of permanent property, although you are liable to charges for agency, for repairs, expenses, and outgoings of various descriptions, which reduce the net income, none of those deductions were permitted to be made in regard to the assessrnent of Income-tax; therefore, virtually at this moment precarious incomes pay at the rate of 7d. in the pound, and permanent incomes at the rate ol 9d. in the pound. That was another reason why no further difference of rate should be established between these two descriptions of property. One other great difficulty I will mention. It is quite clear that aU precarious incomes are derived in part from capital and in part from the skiD andinteUigence of the owners. Capital of every kind should be charged at the same rate - but unquestionably a ground exists why a lower rate should be charged upon that portion of a man's income which is derived from his own personal skill and intelligence; but then it would benecessarv in the case of every contributor to the tax that the tax-collector should know minutely the state of his circumstances, should know what part of his income was realy due to his possession of capital. and what portion of it was due to his own ability and devotion to his buwsiness, and it was because it was foreseen that the endeavour to carry inqui-y to this extent, to push investi ation in the case of private affairs up to the very hilt, would be so obnoxious and distasteful to the community that the attempt to effect such an object was abandoned; it was seen that under such an organiation of the tax it could not be long maintained, and therefore a d fferent course was pursued. (Hear.) You must recoUect that the income-tax has never been considered a permanent part of the financial system of this count-y. It has always been considered as an expedient to be had recourse to in times of great emergency. I beheve that is a proper policy to pursue. With regard to this tax, doubtless direct taxation has advantages over indirect, but the knowledge that we possess in our armoury of finance a weapon so formidable as the income-tax, which if put in force can bring into our Exchequer in the course of a year 10,000,0001., or 20,000,0001., or 30,000,0001., sufficient to sweD our army and our forces to almost any extent we please-I do believe that the knowledge on the part of foresgn countries that we possess so great a power as this does tend to stifle many ambitious projects, many rebellious instincts, that they may from time to time be possessed with in regard to this country, and to that extent serves to mamntain our external tranquility and peace with the world. (Loud cheers.) Gentlemen, the other objections which have been made to this tax are of minor importance. I must confess myself to a predilection in favour of thatpointofstartingforthe income-taxwhichwasestablished when it wasimposedin 1842. Thatwas an occasion on which the income-tax was had recourse to for the purpose of meet. ing a great emergency. In the firstinstance it had beenaneed 50 years before to put a stop to the accumulation of the load of debt which had been going on for a considerable period prior to that time. In 1842 it was had recourse to for the purpose of enabling certain great commercial reforms to be carried out, to liberate the industry of this country, to allow the produce of foreign countries to come into our markets on the same footing of advantage with productions of our own country, and I think that no one will say who rightly appreciates the advantages which have been derived from the policy established in 1842 -and it was to enable such polcy to be carried out that the income-tax was imposed-no one will say that the advantages which have been derived to the country have not been cheaply purchased, very cheaply I may say, with reference to the inconveniences that have been submitted to in consequence of the imposition of this income-tax. (Hear.) Now, I say, as far as my p~rediliction is concerned, I should be glad to see the income hable to this tax starting from loOI. a-year and upwards. (Cheers,) I do not recollect precisely the circumstances under which incomes betwveen 100L. and 1o0I. were made chargeable to this tax; I believe it was in consideratfon that some equivalent and counterbalancing advantages weregivento those who
ossessed incomes fluctuating between the two points. Xhe other matter which has been referred to has reference to the mode in which the income-tax is colected. I can truly say that these and other matters before referred to shall receive my earnest consideration. We know that the session is about to open, and I think that you may look with confidence to a solution of this question being made by the Government, which wiU meet the public sentiments upon the subject. As regards myself, I can truly and confidentially assure you that I shall endeavour to discharge my duty in regard to this, as to aU other matters, with diligence and fidelity. I am always mindful of the responsibility I am under by being the trustee of your public interests. There is no object to which I attach more value than the retention of your good opinion, and I have every reason to be thankful to you for the confidence reposed in me up to the present time, and I trust that for the future I shall do nothing which shaU forfeit your good opinions, which shall make you ever repent the selection which you made on a former occasion, or which shall make you hesitate to renew the relationship which subsists between us upon any future occasion which may arise, (Loud
It was agreed that a petition embodying the resolution should be drawn up for presentation to Parhament, and a vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.

BURGLARY.-During the night of Monday last a
BURGLARY.-DUring the night of Monday last a burglary was committed at the mansion of Lady Frauldand Russell, Chequer's Court. Bllesborough, Bucks. The thieves, who were evidently no strangers to the premises, obtained entrance into the house by breaking a pane of ilass in a window in the north front, which they opened. Thsy then proceeded systematically an(I quietly in their work of depredation, entering the various rooms in the house by means of the keys, and cutting the paintings from the frames. After they had secured all that they considered worthy of their attention, they hung up the keys in their accustomed place, and made-their egress by the front door. The family being in Yorkshire, only two female servants and a gardener slept in the house, none of whom were disturbed, although it afterwards appeared that the thieves must have entered the very room adjoining that in which the gardener was sleeping, and the robbery remained undiscovered until the afternoon of Tuesday, when the broken window and some spots of blood on the sill attracted the attention of one of the labourers employed in the grounds. He immediately gave the alarm, when the front door was found to be ajar, and the faet that thieves had been in the house was speedily discovered. Mr. Superintendent Hamilton was immediately sent for, who made a most searching investigation, hitherto, however, we beheve, without much sucess. In the course of the examination of the premises it was discovered that the thieves had also attempted to plunder the platechest, as in the lock was found a portion of a skeleton key. Suspicion attaches itself, it is said to three men who had been staying at High Wyeonibe during the previous two or three days, but who had since disappeared. When they left Wycombe, it is said that a p-pe and a knife, belonging to the landlord of the house w ere they lodged, disappeared also; and there is little doubt the knife so stolen was used for the purpose of cutting out the paintings, as that and the pipe were found in one of the roomns when the robbery was discovered. Both pi
and knife have, we hear, been identified; and an additional source of suspicion was furnished by a man living at Stony-green, on the road from High Wycombe through Hampden-park to Chequers. This man states that after midnight on Monday night he was called up by some person with a horse and cart, who offered him 2s. 6d., and ultimately gave him 5s., to show him the most direct road to Chequers. He also says that the horse was a fine one, and that it was driven at a rapid rate by the stranger until he came to Chequers-park, when he was dismissed, and advised to take the shortest way home through the fields. If the robbery had been discovered earlier on tHe Taesday these facts would probably have enabled aUr Hfamilton to pursue and, perhaps, capture the thieves; but now such an endeavour appears to be almost hopeless, and it is more than probable that before the theft was known London was reached and the proceeds of the robbery disposed of.

SHsTLDs, Jan. 26,-The Mercbant Shipping Act contains some very stringent clauses with regard to intemperate masters of vessels, and a case that has been heard before the Tynemouth borough magistrates this afternoon shows very strongly the necessity for such magisterial powers. Richard
ddison, the master of the Scottish Maid, of Sunderland, had the whole of his crew before the bench for mutinous conduct and violently assaulting him on the high seas. The vessel had been on a voyage to Rouen, and was returning to the Tyne with a cargo. When off Shields harbour the master alleged that he was seized by the crew and most murderously cut and beaten about the head and person. When the case was heard on both sides, however, it appeared that he had been drinking during the whole voyage from Rouen to Shields, and that when the vessel was off the bar he came on deck "roaring drunk," and bellowed for the watch; and, no one answering him, he had fallen in with one of the seamen named fHodgoon, and took the sou'wester from his head and threw it overboard. Hodgson had then knocked him down, and, there is no doubt, had fearfully mauled him about the head and body. The master had afterwards got into the forecastle, and had gone staggerin about with a marling-spike in his hand, threatening to Ii some of the crew. Threeof the men had got bold of him and held him on abed until hebecame quieter, when he was allowed to go to his cahin. He had afterwards torn the forecastle funnel away, and sluiced the fire out with a bucket of water as the crewv were sitting round it. As soon as the vessel got into harbour he very adroitly gave the whole of the crew into custody, including the apprentices, so that no one could appear to give evidence against him. The niagistrates acquitted the mate, two seamen, and the two boys, and sent Hodgon for a month to gaol, at the same time expressing their disapprobation of the master's conduct. The men state that they have a strong caise against the master if they are allowed to state it, but by placing them all in the dock upon one charge ho effectually prevented them doing so before the magistrates.
THE OLDEST MAN L' AMEICA.-A coloured man, now resident at Woodstock, Vermont, has reached the extraordinary age of 126, and is doubtless the oldest living man in the country. His history has been traced out by Mr. N. Haskell, towvn clerk of Woodstock, and it appears be was born two years before Washington, was 46 years old at the declaration of independence, and long before the second war with Great Britain broke out he bad passed the Scriptural limit of life-threescore years and ten,ArnicciM Papev;

GREENWICH.
Mfr. BRTSTOW presented a memorial from the Board of Works for the Greenwich district, praying that the issuing of precepts for the district might be deferred until the board had fuUy considered several circumstances (stated in the memorial) which, in the opinion of the memorialists, requ-ied a more equable distribution of local taxation than that proposed by the Finance Committee.
The memorial having been received,
On the motionof Mr. BRISrOW, it was ordered to be taken into conrideration when the report on the financial statement was brought up.
APPLICATION OF XESSRS. BROADWOOD AND SONS,
The manufactory of Messrs. Broadwood and Sons, situate in Horseferry-road, 'Westminster, having been recently destroyed by fire, those gentlemen made application to the board for permission to erect a workshop four feet in advance of tne regular line of the buildings on either side of their premises on a vacant space enclosed by a wall. The board refused to give their assent, whereupon Messrs. Broadwood took the opinion of Sir Fitzroy KeUy and Mr. Lloyd on the question. The opinion of those gentlemen being in favour of Hessrs. Broadwood and Sons' right to erect a building on the vacant space of ground in front of their workshops, the matter was referred to the superin. tending architect of the board, who recommended that the beard should not consent to the proposed projection
Mr. Blaxland, of the firm of Jones and BlaxIand, solicitors, appeared in supDort of the right of Messrs. Broadwood, and suggested that, if an doubt were entertained on the subject the question should be brought before some competent legal tribunal for a final decision.
Mr. WRIGHT thought it impossible that the request of hessrs. Broadwood could be complied with. If those gentlemen were allowed to advance their building over the vacant space in front of their present workshop the same permission must in consistency be granted to the humblest shopkeeper in the street. Within 20 years the board would have to buy up the whole of the narrow part of the street, it being in contemplation to constract a bndge over the River Thames opposite Old Horseferry-road. It was not a question for a lawyer to decide, but one appertaining entirely to the duties of an architect. Ie moved that the board do proceed to the next order of the day.
Mr. TuRNER seconded the motion, and said it was not a question on which the board could come to any decision, it being entirely a matter for the adjudication of the local authorities.
Mr. R. TAYLOR said, he had that day viewed the premises, and had come to the conclusion that if the board refused to grant the permission asked for they would be doing great injustice to Mfessrs. Broadwood.
rr. BIDG.ooD considered himself on this occasion as representing the public interest. The duty of the board was to obtain every possible means for giving to the public light, air, ventilation, and free passage from one part of the metropolis to another. If, then, by accident a fire occurred and did the work for them, as in the case of the fire at Covent-garden, it was their duty to take advantage of it. This was a sinilar case, and if they did not act upon that principle they would be sitting there as a board in vain.
MIr. Deputy HARRISON, referring to the plan of the street, said it was true there was a vacant space between the outer wall and the resent worksho s of Mlesss. Broadwood, which wall enciosed ground blonging to them; but that wall did not constitute the line of building. The act of Parliament distinctly said that the line of building in a street was not to be defined by external walls, which might enclose portions of land; but that it was to be determined by the houses in the particular street. There was in the Horseferry-road acontinuous line of street, 630 feet in length, without any irregularity, except in one instance, which was that of a smalU shop 14 feet in height and which the board had the power of pulling down and making compensation to the owner. Ia the present case he did not think one moment's consideration was required. It was impossible the board could sanction the claim which Messrs. Broadwood were attempting to establish.
After some further discussion, the motion fur proceeding to the next order of the day was put and agreed to.
THE SURFACE AND SUBSOIL OF NEW STRE}TS.
On the motion of Mr. WIuGHT, seconded by Mr. SNOW, it was agreed, by a majority of 9, 13 being for and 4 against the motion,
"That the committee of Works be authorizeod to select four profeEsioeal men for the purpoce of examining the designs which may be sent in to the board by the several competitto showing the best mnoi
of laring out the surface and subsoil of the new streets and othor particulars described in the resolution of the Board of the 16th of January. and that the board do nominate the two memben, to be associated with the chairman."
On the motion of Mr. CARPMAEL, seconded by Mr. Rows, Mr. Alderman Cubitt, ILP., and Mr. Wright were nominated the two members to be associated with tho chairman.
The greater portion of the day was occupied in hearin
appeals in cases of compensation awarded by the Boarl of Works for the Limehouse district, and objected to by the ratepayers.
Adjourned at half-past 5 o'clock.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Your kind assistance is requested in ms.king public the injustice exercised towards me by the Russian Government. The main facts yon will find stated in an accompanying case, submitted by me to Lord Clarendon, when requesting his intervention to procure redress from the Russian Government when my own applications had failed.
I was detained by the Russian Government, notwithstanding the repeated assurances of the Commander-inChief of the Black Sea fleet, Admiral Berg, and of the Intendant of the fleet, Vice-Admiral Mytlene, that I should meet with no detention. The promise of Prince Vasilchikov, Governor-General of Kiev, to the same effect was annuUed. By this I was put to the useless expense of a compulsory Journey to Gitomir from Nicolaiefi, and a residence of three months in an hoteL Some weeks after my arrival in Moscow I was allowed the suim of about 10s. per diem to maintain myself, wife, and four children, and that, too, in a capital more expensive than London. AII my applications for the payment of my traveUing expenses even wero unanswered. ln an interview with Lord Clarendon in June last, to whom I was presented by the Hon. T. Milner Gibson, he promised to request Lord Wodehouse to interpose on the subject. The only effect of his interposition has been the remittance of 201. 14es. 10d., being the sum the Russian Government say was sufficient to pay my own expenses from Nicolaieff to Moscow, altogether ignoring my compulsory journey to Gitomir and the existence of my wife and four chidren. I think that, in aU fairness, the Eneulish Government are bonnd to insist upon justice boing done, or of doing it themselves, for if I had remained in the Russian service, as, for instance, Mr. Baird of St. Petersburg, and one or two others did, I should, I grant, have been a traitor, but by the terms of the Treaty of Peace a pardoned one; and I should now have been at home with some X,0001. in Land, instead of having sacrificed 1,2001., to say nothing about the anxiety and annoyance of being detained as a prssoner in Moscow. In truth, the four or five individuals who were detained under somewhat similar circumstances, and did what they ought to do, are made to saffer, while the traitor is pardoned by the English Government, and liberaUy rewarded by the Russians. I think the llussinus were bound to treat me altogether as a prisoner, or else leave me free; they treated me as a prisoner by detaining me, and as a free man when it came to the payment of expenses-that is, I was free to pay them myself.
A Russian officer of high rank, whose name for obvious reasons I cannot zive, warned me while stil in Nicolaieff not to believe a wora the Commander-in-Chief said ; that as I had refused to serve the Government any longer they only wanted to get me out of the place ; and that he oould assure me they had not the slightest intention of aLUowing me to leave the country, for I knew too much. I told himn that, although I vas weU aware that the Government in Russia was not very scrupulous, yet Icould not believe that they would be so dishonourable as not to fulfil their written and verbal promise to me, more especially as they had for many years behaved to me in the most honourable manner. Oh I he answered, that was as long as you were wrilling to serve them, and they required your services. Unfortunately for me I did not believe him, and so was pu' to an extra expense of 3001. by my journey and detention in Poland. If you think this exposure will at all events be a wvarning to any of our countrymen at present in Russia, or likely to go there, its insertion, or even a part of it, will much oblige Your most obedient servant.
