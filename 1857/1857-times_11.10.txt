THB UIT.D STAT2. I (FROM O0a NEW YORX COONDN. NEW YORK, Ocr. 28. The Atlantic, which was to have uailed on Saturday, was found on the moment of departure to b,-s s defective in machinery that sailing was imposslb'e; and once more the public convenience has uffaerea through the failings of this line. The Postmaster of New York telegraphed to the Post-office Department for authority to transmit ike maiis by the Vanderbilt, which sailed the same day. The authority was refused, and the mails, which had all been made up, and were on board tee steaimer, were obliged to lie over until .e accident could be repaired. This was done by yesZerday rornipg. it is probable that you wril get my letter _ Saturday before this arrives, but the tirae intervening between the sailing of the twro packets is Eo short that I feel little, more than E, pos'script to that is necessary. There is r lane for the better in financial matters within tl - 1wres cayS Stocks yesterday took an upward tena T r.iiois Central shares and bonds in pa.; - .a;ced largely; but I do no' 'h ,k that the advaace indicated any posi.-fe bmprovement. The exchanges are Fuil deranged, the demand for money is still as active as ever, the want of confidence is still as decided, the crop is still in the West, the merchants are still asking extensioa on their notes, and the process of general liquidation is still going on. The Bank statement of the week shows, for the firs' time for many weeks, an expansion. The footing are:- Ioans . I. . ... ... $95,776,437 Specio ... ... ... ... e0,0z355 Circulation ... ... ... 6884,739 Deposits ... ... ... ... 57,891,09S This shows a Contraction in loas .. . $1,269,389 Increase in spece ... 2,168,125 Increase in deposits ... 5,448,608 Decrease In circulation ... 1,202,702 Nearly one-third of the contraction in loans is in a single institution (the Bank of Commerce), and on the whole it may be viewed, in consideration of the condition of the community and the recent rapid contraction, as equivalent to a substantial expansion. One great feature of the existing troubles I have not seen alluded to in the American journals-the abuse of sterling credits. Many of the weak firms and corporations have tried to prop themselves Vp by the purchase of such credits and sale of the bills in the streets. Dry goods housem have done this by the hypothecation of bills receivable that could be used in no other way, and ralway corporations in a varietby of ways that it is needless to enter into. It is also useless to particularize names. It is enough to say that by the operation English credit and means have been used to prop up falling concerns, without, in most instances, provlng equal to the task; and exchange between the countries has been completely deranged in consequence. On this subject the New York Times of this morning says - "As touching these foreign credits, a word or two will como in just here not inappropriately. Against the liberality with which they have been employed it may not become our people to rail, but it is quite as wel to let our late friends on the other aide ktow that the natare of the operation Is pretty well understood as to have them suppose that we, and not their own importing agents, and merchant bankers, and provincial banks, are responsible for most of the embarassments which have grown out of it. The bills employed have been credits in fact as well as name. They assume the shape of foreign capit xi for the first time now, when the money to carry on the seductive but hazardous machinery can no longer be had on this side. That it is likely to be a somewhat' permanent as well as inconvenient investment we all deplore, but the commissions heretofore harvested, and for a series of year5 'with little interruption or loss, through the process of employing American staples one half the year mnd American gold the other half to cover these credits every 60 days must, in parb at Iast, be taken ia recompense. The resulting losses should not be wholly charged to the ' brazen dishonesty of Yankeedoodledom,' but entered to the account of a too sanguine reliance upon the el ,stialty of the system. This, like the facile practice of seling single-name paper through the discount brokers, hal crowded the market with European goods in advance of its atual wants for consumption, stimulated speculation in the products of the Indies, made jobbers In factories, in railways, and in real estate of the importing merchants, many of them forelgners, and brought upon all parties concernel a large number of individual suspensions of payment, the most striking developments of 'which are the immense sums total to which single firms have been trusted by their bankers. Surely the whole responsibility for this cannot be said to rest on this country any more than upon our European cousins, who granted such facilities, and who are now perhaps disposed to abuse our whole people In nnaus, as a few of our morchants have unfortunately abused their credits." While this part of the country has been distracted by its financial embarrassments, the people of Kansas have quietly settled the question that threatened last year to dissolve the Union. A Free State member of Congress has been elected, as well as a Free State Legislature. (FROM AOTHErs COnnsPOrnENT.) ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, Ocr. 20. Up to a very recent date this city of the West might have been described as a pleasant, busy, and thriving locality. It is well situated and well-built, with much commerce by land and by water, the produce of an immense region being floated down to it by the two great rivers that here unite into the mightiestinland stream of the contient. It has a fleet of steamers at its wharfs, surrounded by fertile prairie lands; it has much corn to sell, and it is linked by railroads with the city populations of the East that must buy it. But all these material advantages have suddenly become useless to it. The commercial panic has descended on the place like a blight. Everything is confusion, anxiety, and distrust. Business is paralyzed and confidence destroyed; no one can clearly explain how or why. The wealthieat men of the city have fallen, and a host of smaller capitalists have gone down with them. Hundreds of workmen have been discharged-the worst consequence of all on the edge of winter. Everybody's "promises to pay" have changed all at once into dead leaves, sniffed at by money-chaugers and rejected by retail dealers. What has so long been the common currency was no longer current, or passed only with a loss on every transfer. Every purchase involved a wrangle and a fleecing operation in the way of discount; and there was an extensive interchange of small miseries and mutual perplexity. This was on the lower levels of retail trade; in the higher I circles of commerce, the sphere of loans, advaneti, and accom the casewas still-worse. It was evelywhere the same; the land is studded with embarrassed and insolvent communities; from the day credit fell prostrate in New York the telegraph wires have done little but conveyintelligence of each other's misfortunes. Till it Is ascertained that the worstpoint is reached there appears to be no possible remedy; there Is consequently an actual imp3tence to arrive at that worst, and to be assured that the general ruinis consummated. Hopes are loudlyexpressedtha, every bank in the nation may suspend, that a fresh start may be made on a new basis, the universal lock-up of funds and stagnation of business being unendurable. The greatest struggle to hold out against the run was made by the banks of New York, and, as some assert, was made uselessly, since by putting on the screw so suddenly and so tightly they wrenched the whole machinery of commerce to fragments, w.ithout saving themEelves from final wreck. Now they have yielded to the pressure and suspended esn masse, It is hoped the end of the downward rush is near; unless the lowest depth reveals a lower deep, perhaps It is, but no calculation of it is quite safe, for society has drifted upon debt, paper, and belief iD. everything, beyond a1 soltd- ings. Here and there a bank make3 a stand against the general policy of supending. The bank of this State, Missouri, has done so; but it wiD only be a matter of local pride hereafter; it does not affect the grand result. When Boston, Philadelphia, and New York proclaim temporary insolvency, what the distant " villages" may do is considered, and is, immateriaL Specie has ceased avowedly to be the basls of the paper circulation; Buspension is the declared policy, and there an end. 'The first effect of the panic here was the common one; it created an universal demand for specie. Every Interest that thought itself strong enough to enforce payment of its dues and charges In coin did so, with very partial and no permanent succeo. After years of reliance on paper an abrupt icsnge to an oppoite and more solid system was simply :-possible. The proprietors of the MiBsis9ri' steamers, a atrong interest, combined, and an- ouneed that they would not take currency," or note., for freights. They obtained no cargoes on the specie condition, and in a few days cancelled the resolution. Now there are no freights to be carried on any terms, and the boats are lying, more than a mile of smokeless fannels, idle at the quays. The wholesale firms would not take "c urrency" for goods from country customers, nor even for debts. The goods are unsold and the debts unpaid. The small shopkeepers followed with aotices that they also declined " currency ;" the notices could not put coin into purchasera' pockets, and the wares remained unsold. All paper was I looked at askance, but that of the banks of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois was the greatest averslon of the retailers. In the midst of the difficulty the annual State fair and cattle show of Missouri was held here; by the influx of visitors from Mllinois, I the bordering State, there was more of the unpopu- lar paper afloat than ever. The reception St. Lopis gave itaguests fromacross theoissiappi was not hospitable, financially spealking, considering that the city Is as much the capital and centre of Illinois as of Missour itelf. The shops would not take the money the visitors brought 'with them; cabdrivers and omnibus men would not touch it-often swore they would not, emphatically. Strong language rose round the paying place of the theatres for a dmilar cause; lastly, the hotelkeepers rejected it by grinkly brief placards in their marble halls. Much of all this was absurd; the distnction made between note and note, when all paper was In exactly the same condition, was useless. The issues of the banks are based on the stock, funds, or debt of the respective States; the bonds of all such property being for the time unsaleable, the basis cannot be converted. Misouar banks are no better in this respect than those of its neighbours; the notes of all are as intrinsically worthless one as the other, and prospectively as good as any " promise to pay" a private debt based on the future redemption of a public one can be. But there is a State pride in these things a stranger cannot appreciate, and that feeling was at the bottom of the war made by Missouri on the notes of Ilinois; a rational cause for It there was none. This is evident from the fact that when the embarrassment became intolerable the proscription lost its first fury, and gradually ceased. People began to consider that the frantic attempt to evoke specie having failed-au attempt to extract sunbeams from cucumbers would have, been nearly as successful-and the alternative being notes or nothing, it might be as well to put them in circulation again upon the faith of their prospective value; a meeting of business men was held, at which it was resolved to receive Illinois notzs again at par; the ban being thus in some degree taL-en off, they began to pass, not at par, however, but at various rates of discount. The wholesale houses having during their rigorous demand for specie driven much of their business to Chicago hope thus to recover it; the hotels cancelled their ukase, and the shops aunounced their readiness to take-anything. In a small way the pressure is relaxed; but in grander affairs the dead lock continues. Specie is not; it has disappeared as if the gnomes of the mine had reclaimed It, as in one sense they have, for most of it is actuay buried in the earth, and carefully concealed from human eyes. The old Pagans were right when they drew Plutus as the most timid of their gods. The return to something like system in the sphere of petty commerce was, perhaps, rendered easier by the fact that from the beginning of the panic there was no complete unanimity among the shopkeepers in the refusal of paper; some continued to take it from the first. Th3 dealers in the necessaries of life were the sternest in rejection; the sellers of fancy goods and the lighter inutilities were more pliable. Thus, the money that at one time would not purchase a pair of boots or a dinner was good for an accordion, a Noah's ark, or a picture after Watteau. They heli out a temptation to rescue something tangible from the wreck of representative value; graduaUy, however, all yielded to necessity, and "foreign" paper (Illinois being as foreign to Missouri as Surrey to Middlesex) is now exchangeable for aU commodities, food and clothing included, at more or less discounii. Conspicuous among the retailers for their readines3 to receive any kdnd of notes are the jewellers, among whom the financial talent of the ",great race," with its keen glance and exemption from " State" ant local prejudices, may be seen at work. They take any paper with which a present value remains, or which may recover any value at all-notes of banks broken that await a final winding-up, notes uncurrent by distance from the place of issue, notes of banks discredited, and of bank-s suspended which may resume; for all these, or a mixture of them, prefaced by a wordy bargain and much ciphering, a selection may be made of rings, pins, and shir' studs which few would purchase in their right minds, and with judgment steadied by specie. But inconvertible paper, already at a heavy discount, and with a distant prospect, at best, of reviving, it seems almost prudence to get rid of. The jewellers furnish to some extent a means of converting; bankIng grew out of the goldsmiths' shops, and in a chaos like this there is a partial return to first principles. On any conditions the recovery of a medium of circulation is a great relief. What the paper, EO recently in all the glory of par, has lost in value is not exactly known; a depreciation of 10 per cent. is very generally submitted to; but, in fact, every body takes as much off everything as he can, and discount ranges from 5 per cent. to 50, according to the ignoranee or fears of noteholders. Real property has sunk in worth, incomes are reduced; all feel the depression, but none can define Its extent. The excitement of the convulsion-for it had an excitement-is past; the period of dull, heavy suffering it will leave is yet to come, There is one eminent exception to the general prostration-the Central Government of the United States and its teasury. The financial policy of the Government is, and has beenf for a generation, the very reverse of the practice of the nation. The people have had an unlimited faith in paper; the Government rejects a& paper, and takes nothing but eoin. It neither receives nor issues any note of any kind; the best paper of the best bank of New York would not buy a sheet Df postage-stamps. The Federal Treasury is rigorously bullionist; it takes only gold for import duties; sells its lands only for specie, and what it receives It hoards,-that is, keeps under its own lock and key tMll wanted for its own expenditure. Individauals who have done this during the panic are reproached with folly, cowardice, and with increasing the terror; it is Au i9wQnaiitency; why shguld individuals be gocused almost of crime for doubting all paper proniies when they are branded with insolvency if the Government rejects them at all times as worthless, even in the rosiest flush of their prosperity,and credit ? The bulk of the circulation is something that is money among the people, but no money at al to the Government, which does not recognize it as value. The two systems now present the most glaring contrast. The community, with unlimited faith in paper, is suddenly bankrupt, every intereat broken up, manufactures and commerce alike in confusion and dismay, enterprise extinguished, and the wealthiest cities haunted by the dread of the grim phantom, pauperism, rising in their midst. At the same moment the Central Govern. ment is erect and firm, the sole strong money power In the nation. While private employers stop all undertakings for want of funds, the Federal Treasury is carrying on extensive and magnificent public works, building ships of war, '*taYing offthe national debt, rnd making aU its payments in coin. It has expended the whole of the appropriation of the revenue made for the latter purpose, and thus released something more than a million sterlng from its cofferg in the last six weeks. This is au indirect help to the commercial world, but other aid the Government cannot furnis. It stands isolated from the community; ita solid credit lends nothin. of its stability ti the smallest fraction of the paper circulation. The people may look on that picture and then on this, and draw its own conclusions. present teachings differ widely on the subject; some holdup the practice of the Government as worthy of general imitation, and the popular instinct has imitated it ex;tensively; other authorities denounce it as the " perfection of distrust, unreason, and cynicism ;" but there is the patent fact; the embo diment of these financial vices is firm on its legs, while the perfection of trust, withthe other opposite virtues, are floundering in the mire of ruin. Without going into the difficult question of carrency, and admitting that an exclusively metallic circulation is neither possible nor desirable, some description of what the paper currency of America is will not be out of place. The Federal Government has retained the sole right of coining the money of the nation; all the gold and silver of the country is federal; no state of the Union can have its own Mint. But, while retaining this authority, the central power has alowed the control of the paper circulation to pass from its hands; it neither issues nor authorizes the Issue of any notes; consequently there is no paper that Ir equaRy good, or at par, even during periods of prosperity throughout the Union. No State coins gold, but 30 States may print paper money, a and delegate the right to do the same to any persons they choose; there is complete independence; 30 States, and many banks in each State (280 in New York alone), work their mints of paper, coin is rarely seen, and the country is flooded with the I promises of hundreds of banks, no two aike. Sach a circulation is, of course, miserably provincial and local. Thence arises continual discounting, and a proscription to the amount of it, of the money of one State by another. Louisiana rejects the notes of South Carolina, Ohio will not receive the notes of Maine, Missouri elevates the nose at the money of Alabama, and so on through the round of "Sovereignties." The rejection, it may be said, is not total; but the reception is only secured by submitting to a loss; the paper is an endless tiouble and perplexity. The paper system, in itself an advance in civilization, is so managed as to reproduce all the barbarism of the many coinages of Europe in the middle ages. Every State, and every trade, occupation, and interest, has its own special bank; where these issues are known the confusion and uncertainty are a sufficient evil; but beyond the locality the doubt with which they are received is humiliating-often ludicrous. The shopkeeper to whom a note issued by the Incorporated Butcher5 or Bootmakers, or some other clique, is proffered looks at it, turns it over, holds it up to the light, and, after the suggesting inquiry of "You have nothing elso "" fails in it, effect, goes to hlis " Detector"-a book which in itself is a comment on the whole system,-checks off the lists of broken banks, and suspensions, and known counterfeits; and if the note does not appear in any of the condemned catalogues, he accepts it, though he stiUl suspects it very grievously. He has to repeat the operation many times a day; so must all retailers, so must every body, or lose seriously-be " stuck,"as the phrase is. Beyond the State, and in proportion to the distanc3 from it, the difficulty increases, and to get on with any comfort the notes must be converted at a moneychanger's, who charges, of course, a discount over for other paper; you must pay silver to change one piece of rag for another. This is the case when all is prosperous; now the confusion is worse confounded, and the war of discounts between Stats and State is internecine. To rescue the paper currency of America from its condition of provincial barbarism a Central or Federal paper is required. The Constitution, there is little doubt, gave the Central Power control of all issues of money, coin, or paper, and as in its hands the coinage is sound, well divided, and universaUy current, it would not be impossible to obtain a paper issue that would have the same qualities. That a country with such a side-pocket of bullion as California should tolerate the present confused medley of paper is inexcusable. If the evil is not checked by course of law it is not improbable it will be remedied in another way, of which several signifcant indications have been already given. Every interest that feels established endeavours to avoid paper. The Federal Government has done so for 20 years. The great monopolists wlll follow its example. The telegraph companies have succeeded, they receive only coin; some of the ferry companies are doing the same; the steamboat proprietors of the Mississippi have tried to do it, but fatled-for the present. Where a monopoly is complete and the public is fully in its power, as in some of the city supplies of gas and water, the movement would be more likely to succeed. When the comnmunity can no longer pay its Import duties, nor its water rates, nor its ferry tolls, nor its steamboat fares in the money of the Bootmakers' and kindred corporations, their notes wiU be so perpetuaUy thrown back on their hands for specie that they will most likely break, or give up banking as unprofitable; in either case the public would be rid of them, to its profit and comfort. This reform cannot be immediate, and may be rendered unnecessary; but there is a visible tendency in that direction which this crash will quicken. With the Customhouses, the post-offices throughout the country, the department of land sales, and the telegraph companies already rejecting paper on principle, and without reference to pasing events, other interests and corporations only less strong have great encouragement to do the same; they are now trying the experiment. One illustration of local or State feeling in reference to local paper is so odd that it deserves separate mention. There is an antipathy to " foreign" paper, as already mentioned, but If the notes of a State have, in the course of business, been taken out of it they appear to become foreign, or exiles who muist not return. Brokers who gather up these distant notes and send them back to their birth-place for redemption are excesBively unpopular; they are called " asorters," and assorting notes is described as a crime akin to " sweating" gold. " Assorters'" agents have been mobbed in several instances in the last week. There were two eases in Kentucky; the notes of a district of that State had strayed to Cincinnati; they were collected, and an agent with a carpetbag full of them was sent to the parent bank to demand sp@o. But an accurate description of himself carpetbag, and purpose had preceded him by telegraph, and on his arrival he found an indignant crowd waiting for him; he never reached the bank; hustled, hooted, and in bodily peril, he returned by the next train, lucky in escaping tar and feathers. His errand was perfectly legal, but the offence appears to have been, not the attempting to Mlemand specie, but coming from Ohio to demand It. Refused where it has been in circulation, and driven back when it retUrns to the place of iaue, the holders of such paper are doubly victimized; topo. graphy Is at present an important element iu finance. With the exception of this outbreak against the " assorters, " and one rural bauLk gutted by its enraged customers, the crisis has been met very quietly; there bas been nothing that can be called serious riot or outrage, though there wa, much that might well have provoked them. As if to complete the panic, in the height of the confason St. Louis was shaken out of bed oue morning by the shock of an earthquake, the aevereal on record since 181L It lasted several rninute, beginning with a vibration like that caused by the psing of heavy waggons along the street. Then the earth heaved upwards, and, with a sharp wrench to one side, sank down again as suddenly. Thele was a second shock, but much weaker. binney ornaments were toppled over. Luckilythe chimueys. themselves stood firm, though soot and mortar rattled down them. Before the alarm was complete the thock had pased off; but people lit their candles and put their heads out of window to inquire about it. There were two or three secondi during which the pecu;iar terror inspired by a great earthquake was conceivable; had the sharpet: motion lasted a minute, no one could have redsted the impulse to rush out of the house. The next day the most alarming ramours were abroad, but nodamage Ws done.
CHBVALIERf CUSHING ARD THE LADzIs (From the New York Herald.) The knights of old wore in the habit of waiting a gret' deal of vtaluble time by defending at sword's point the reUtation of some partioular damsel to whom they inlined. RaChevaler Cusnlng goes futther, and enters the list to do battle for all the ladies. He declares that they are not at all responsible for the present finscial revulsion; that their flounoes and furbelows are only A bagatelle in the question of exports and imports; that their crinoline did not stop the Erie Railway; that their ilks did not break the Ohio Lfe and Trust Company; that their kid glovesr and Lilliputian bonnets had nothing to do with the sto ppa of the great dryr goods houses; and, further, that theiistleof dress is qumte the correct thing in every way. And ae the sald Chevlier, makes public proclamation that he will defend this issue alter the good old chivalric custom. Hearye, all men ! the Chevalier, armed at all points, his Tihor own, his lance in rest, awaits the combat. The nlight of Salamanca again is in the field. Now, we do not yield to any man in devotion to the farsex, but wo ae bound to say that nearly all our oountrywomen who have money or credit, or could obtain either, have been for several years shamefuly extravagant; thatthey are almost entirely responsible foz the excessive imports of articles of luxury, which Imports have drained our specie reserve and loaded down our warehouses with articleswhich are of no earthly use; and that they are even now spending too much money for articlesthey do not need, butwhich they buy simply on account of a decline in prioe. Let us see the figures.- The total value of the Imports for the fiacal year sndin June 30, 1856, was $314,639,942, of which, for atticles o1 luxury consumed by women, we have spent $43 624,558 Forty-three millions of dollars ! That is equal to tihe whole product of the gold mines in California for one year, and that would have more than snfficed to eave us from the crisis. Of this sum $31,218,766 were paid for silks and manufactures of silks; $6,376,853 for laces and embroideries; shawls, $2,59,771; gloves, Sl344,55furs, $964,731 ; jewelry, $844K630; silk and' worste piece goods, $1,335,247. e expended two milloons more for silk than for sugar, and so on. We have omitted many items which would teU against the women, as It may be urged that men consume a portion of the articles above enumerated. The articles omitted- bijoitcrie, artificial flowers, French shoes and boots, fancy articles, anda thousand and one frtipperies that make up that wonderful mystery, a fashionable woman's attire-would more than balance the account. There is a little item of $42,000 for perfumed soap, which is quite a good index to the whole thing. Again, it must be remembered that these figures are taken from the Treasury reports, and that the articles are valued at something under the wholesale zate, while our fair countrywomen are charged upon all such matters as laees at least 100 per cent profit. A set of laces which cost in Paris S20 could not be bought here in llush times for less than $60. It should further be remembered that 20,000 or 30,000 of our women either reside abroad or go to Europe nearly every sum. mer. The amount of rich stuffs-silks, satins, velvets, shawls, and jewelry-which they run through the Customhouse free is eomething enormous-not less than$1,000,000 a-year; and all lucuries of not the slightest use to anybody on the face of the earth. We have seen on board one ship a lady enter as her prsoal baggage 20 large trunks. No princess inl the world woald have so much. The travelled American cannot fail to have noticed tho marked distinction between the promenade dresses of our wromen an,d of those abroad, The French and English women go out to waLk in plain, neat, serviceable dresses, while ours drag their heavy sUks in the gutters. American women are guilty of shameful extravagance and bad taste In wearing for walking dresses robes which are made for the carriage or the drawing-room. More we might allege, for the subject is of the deepest Importance; but, statistically, quite enough has been proved. The worst fact of all rernaiDs to be stated. As far as the question of fashion goes-how a robe shall be out, or the exact size of a hat, or the measure of circumference to bo allowed to a skirt-that is no great matter. If women desire to make themselves the targets of coarse jokes, it ia not for us to deny them that luxury. But we wll put to the Chevalier Cnshing and those who think with him the plain proposition that, as the women of America are pl ced on a pedestal but a little below the angels, as they toil not (we mean the women who are guilty of extravances su.h as we have noted) neither do they spin, the men have t) pay all the biUs-whether so much money can be spent for luxuries and be a mere bagatelle in the question of exrts and imports. We do not know that crinohne and kid eloves broke the Ohio Life and Trust Company-prob&bly the president and directors can teoL better. 3T themajority of our women in good circumstances are drags upon their husbands instead of being helpmeets to them. If one d3es her dn-ty simply it is trumpeted through all the papers as an example of Spartan virtue. The inference is plain that such examples are almost unprecedented. Women rarely throw awvay their own money; nO one is more prudent and careful than a wroman who has a fortune in her owvn right; hut once her taper fingers close on another's check-book the grasp of Hercules could not unaloose them. The Chevahler Cashing asks, " Did the women break the dry goods houses? Yes. The women, in the flush times of '54.'D5, spent twice as much money as they ought; they were capricious and difficult to please-they demanded nestyles-the magasinus of Paris and the manufactories of Lyons and Valenciennes and Brussels were ransacked for them. The importations were double what they should have been. There was nothing to pay for them with. The crisis came. The houses broke, and their counters groan -with stufrs for which there is no market. Nowhere in the world are the women dressed so badly and so expensively as in America. When we go abroad we are astonished by the aimp morning and promenade costumes of the daughters of the English nobility-men with rent-rolls to which an American fortune is a drop in the sea. A French CountLtess, with a fixed income of 100,0001. a-year, will not spend half so much on her dress as the wife of a New rork merchant whose business may give him a profitof $10,000 a-year, and may bring him in debt to double that amount. Let not the Chevalier Cushing look at the vulgar display made at Saratoga, Newport, or Cape May, and compare It with the modest attire of the aristocracy at Baden, Brighton, or Biarritz. The fact Is, our women take French torede fashions at second hand, and were they so attired in a European city they would be taken for what they seem to be rather than wvhat they are. We trust that both the women of America and their champion will think seriously of these things, for they are the truth, and just now we must drink the cup, however bitter it may be. We do not believe that there is anything radically wrong in our women; we are willing to believe, with the sage of Newburyport, that any one of them, were she properly instructed, would be " as prompt to please by frugallty as by luxury, and proud to make any sacrifice of fashion at the voice of duty and love." We believe that many good women in the land will make this sacrlfieeheerfully, for the sex is quick enough in percePtiOn and Drem I enough in action. We hope they will a11 remember the lesson they are now leang, but we cannot sincerely say that we believe in the working of any such miracle, Ther eleventh satire of Jovenai is as true now as it was eighteen centuries ago.

MONArMABKETmdOITYJBTALLiG.NOB. Monday Evening. The Bank of England have to-day raised their charge for discount from 9 per cent., which was adopted on the 4th inst., to 10 per cent. This movement was considered certain, and regret may be felt that the last chauge was limited to a lower point. Whether it wrM prove sufficient to eheck the determination of each discounter to proTide himself with two or three times as much as he wants Is doubtful. While a cry is attempted to be taled that the rate now reached is such a.- to create iatolerable incouvenience, the demand at the Bank Bshows each day that, so far from creating inconvenience to the trader in providing for his ordinary requirements, it does not ,even produce sufficient effect to prevent him grasping -at an unnecessary amount. The fact is, no one with uiiclent credit to obtain discount at all cares in the least about an additional 5 per cent. for a month or two. For a single month the diffefence is 8e. 4d., aud every one feels that before the lapse of that time the worst of the trial will be over. In rigid justice, so long as ay number of the mercantile body are -found to play Into the hands of the Danic-makers it would be satisfactory to see the rate carried to 20 or 25 per -cent., or any point that would at last be regarded as an outlay not safely to be incurred in unreasoning selfishnews. Thus far let it be recorded that the working of our currency system has been perfect, and has upheld us in a position to command the admiration of the world. Under no circumstances could any currency system be open to any other than two objections-first, that it has led to a rate of interest which no ordinary merchant could even temporarily bear; and, secondly, that it not only has led to a crushing rate of interest, but that It has -caused the neces3ary accommodation to be refused -even at that rate. WiU any one venture to say that 10 per cent. is a ruinous rate? In common times in the United States this is about the average charge, and it now ranges there between 24 and 60 per cent. Our own idea of a full rate is 5 per cent.; but surely the lowest profits of our business mlist be 5 per cent., and hence a temporary sacrifice of profits must be the worst that can occur from the payment of 10 per cent. The efforts, therefore, to screate fright by pointing to this charge would be ridiculous if they were not dangerous; but a single lunatIc in a crowd of 10,000 sane people may throw -everything into confusion. With regard to the wecoid point,-the refusal of accommodation at -any terms,-is any one prepared with this complaint? So far from accommodation having been refused, it I= beeni extended. The discounts of the Bank during the past three weeks have been far beyond their usual limits, and the notes in the hands of the publc consequently exceed by a million or two the --total in use a year back, when prices of produce were about 30 per cent. higher and our transactions were being enlarged in aU directions. The only two -charges, therefore, that could ever be available against any possible currency system are not to be heard, and the whole that the clamourers against the Bank Charter Act can allege is, that at a time when all the civilized nations of the earth are frantically struggling for bulion it has enabled the British pnblic, Istead of suffering from a contraction to -enjoy the use of more than a million in excess of the highest amount they ever really want, even when trade, instead of undergoing, as at this moment, -a rapid contraction, is steadily expauding. If the Bank Charter Act-which every man with a sense of national pride should strenuously uphold-is to be - threatened, let it be clearly explained in what point It ha failed. That it may fail to keep off panio when in the midst of a storm there is a determination on the part of a multitude of theorists disappointed by the recent exposure In Parliament of their ily cruditiea to produce it, every one knows; and a time might come when, as a fitting inflictlon ,or their dupes, It would be gratifying, except for the public disgrace of such an event, to see their wishes granted. If in the midst of a rush for extra and unneeded accommodation at the rate of 12 or 15 per cent.1 a Government letter could have the ,effect of stopping the mania and sending the rate back to 7, the lesson would, perhaps, operate on those who had overprovided themselves at the -enhanced price with more force than any argument. The Western Bank of Scotland, at Glasgow, with a paid-up capital of 1,500,0001., and deposits supposed to amount to 6,000,0001., has to-day closed its doors. About a fortnight back the event was ,considered immineat, bat an announcement was -aubsequentlymade on authority, to the effect that the necessary assistance would be afforded by the other Scotch banks to carry it through all its difficalties. Withln the last few days the report had been that the winding up of the concern was insisted upon as a -condition of this aid, that the Western Bank reslsted, and that its safety was accordingly again uncertain. During the past few hours all doubt upon the matter has been removed, and the stoppage is now final. The bank has about 100 branches, and has been established 25 years. Its leading -shareholders are extremely wealthy, a recent esti - mate of their aggregate property placing the total at five or six millions, and the ultimate payment of all liabilities is therefore beyond question. Vhether any portion of the paid-up capital of 1,500,0001. -il be saved caunot be conjectured. Judging from 'former experience in such cases, the shareholders wi have cause to congratulate themselves if they -ecape without being calUed upon for additional sums. The bank had an active conmexion with Amerlca and with American houses in Glasgow and elsewhere, and the first announcement of its beina in peril was consequent upon the failure of a knot of speculative firma in Glasgow about the middle of last month, which was said to have inflicted upon -it a losU of 500,000. Since then its position has lbeen aggravated by other disasters, and the suspen. -slon of Messs. Dennistoun on Saturday has probably operated as the final blow. The suspension has also been announced of Messrs. Bermoch, Twentyman, and PRgg, of London and Manchester, a respectable house largely engaged in -the slk trade as agents. Their liabilities range from 200,0001. to 300,0001., and their fall, it ls said, will probably Involve that of four or five firms with whhom they are connected in the manufacturing distita. The causes of the difficulty are stated ia the annexed circular 59, Fr1day-street, London, Nov. 9. " We are requested by our clients, 3essrs. Bennoch, Twentyman, and Rigg, of Wood-strect, in this oity, and of Manchester, to inf6rm you that, In consequence of the heavy advances they have mado upon goods specially pre. pared for the Amarican and other markets for which there isno present demand, of losses sustained by recent failures in the manufacturing districts, and of the sudden depreoiation in the Talue of silk, of which Mesrs. Benuoob, ETwentman, and Rigg re large holders, they are oompelled to announce their inablty to meet their engagareents. "Messrs. Parrington, Ladbury, and Co., of King-street, acoountants, have been instructed by the principal credl tors to examine Messrs Bennoch and Co.'s books, and prepare a statement of thelr affairs, which they will submis as early as possible to a general meeting of the creditors, of which due notice will be given to you. "We are, &c,, 'REED, LANGFORD, and MARSDEN." Another house to be added to the list is that of M es. Broadway and Barclay, E ast India and ge-eral merchants. The liabilities in this case are supposed to reah 180,0001. or 200,0001. The oawee of the stoppage are not xtated, but it may be Suppoead to be connected with the decline In all articles of produce. The funs to-day have again shown a dege of steAdines that Indicates in a remarkable manor not only the general feeling of conadence which, notwithatanding the severity of the crisis, stiLlI prevai]s tbroughout the country, bat also the abundmnce of capital available for all sound investments. The intimation of the failure of Messrs. Dennistoun exercised no other efFect than that of causing Consols to open at a decline of an eighth and the movement of the Bank to 10 per cent. produced only a further fall of a quarter, from which there was ultimately a reaction. The first transactions in Consol3 for money were at 88 to 7. They. then remained for some time at 881 to i, whence on the breaking up of the Bank Court there was a decline to 8S8, stock being offered at that price. A partial recovery soon occurred, and the last operations were at 881 for money, and 89 to i for the 7th of December. After regular hours there was a further improvement of more than an eighth, although the failure of the Western Bank of Scotland then trauspired. Bank Stock closed at 209 to 211; Reduced, 87i to I; New Three per Cents., 87i to s; India Stock, 21.0 to 213; India Bonds, 50s. to 40s. discount'; and Exchequer-bills 23s. to 17s. discount. The further telegraphic advices from America received in the city this after noon produced a good effect. The discotnt houses have not yet resolved upon any further advance in their rate of allowance for money at call. The London and Westminster and other Joint-Stock Banks, with the exception of the Union, have also for the moment abstained from making any change. The Union always increases or diminishes its rate of allowance so as to keep it 1 per cent. below the Bank rate of discount. There was again an absence of gold withdrawals from the Bank to-day. The exportation of silver to the East seems to have received a complete check. At present scarcely anything is engaged to go by the next steamer, except the 250,0001. on account of the East India Company. An average business has been transactedin foreign stocks at the late depressed prices. Turksh closed nearlyI per cent. lower; Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 99 and 98k; Granada New Active, 17; ditto, deferred, 5; Mexican, 18i ; Peruvian Four-and-a-Elalf per Cents., 76, 74k,' and 75; Portuguese, 42i; Russian Five per Cents., 105; Spanish, 40k; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 25 and 251; ditto, Certificates, 5_; Turki:h Six per Cents., 87j; for the aceount, 86i and 87 and the Four per Cents., Guaranteed, for the account, 96i. The corn-market to-day was very heavy at former prices. In the Liverpool cotton-market there has been a further faU of between Ad. and ld. p r pound. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 55c. for money and 66f. 80c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of a quarter per cent. The question as to the next step to be taken by the Bank of France is stiU in doubt. One cause of d3liiculty is found in the law of interest of 1807. Although the Bank of France have lately been empowered by the Emperor to advance beyond 6 per cent., the private bankers and merchants cannot legally charge more than that rate. Their position, therefore, is rendered very serious by every additional upward movement. The acceptances were returned to-day of Messrs. Hoge and Wiliamson, of Liverpool, correspondenta of William Hoge and Co., of New York. The senior partner was considered to have large property in America. At Paris, according to the letters received to-day, the large American house of John Munro anad Co. has stopped payment. At Amsterdam the failure has taken place of the mercantile house of Gallerkamp, Brothers. The amount is not ascertained. The Joutnal de Constanti-nople announces that the Turkish Government have daided upon constructing a line of telegraph from Constantinople to Bassorah, on the Persian Gulf, passing by Bagdad, and that Mr. Staniforth has proceeded to England to purchase the necessary material. The amount paid into the treasury of the East India Company for bills on India from the 25th of October to the 9th inst. Is 5,8271.
SU,SPENSION OF THB W2STEN BANE OF SCOTLAND. (BY EL1OTRIC 4WD INTBYNAT1ONAL BTLEGRAPr. I GLASGOW, Nov. 9. The Western Bank of Scotland suspended payment at 2 o'clock, at which hour the doors at the head office and branches were closed. Although to some extent looked for the suspension has caused great dismay. The bank did an immense business in Glasgow, and had about a hundred branches scattered over Scotland. Its deposits are very ]arge, amounting, it is said, to between five and six millions sterling. There cannot be any eventual loss as the proprietary contains many of the wealthiest men in Scotland, some of whom are believed to be wortlbt about a milion sterling. The Directors have put forth a statement to the effect that circulars will be immediately issued to the creditors communicating details and suggesting measures to be pursued, which, with forbearance and calm self-possession on the part of the public, may avert many of the calamitous effects which would otherwise result from such a catastrophe. There is scarcely another bank in Scotland (they add) which, if time is allowed by the creditors, i9 so well able to draw upon the resources of its wealthy proprietary. The holders of the notes of the bank are enjoined not to part with them at a discount, as full ultimate payment is certain.

TELL&. oF LtAiaRE "D msa BAND.-a4 may be i remembered that some months aao accounts -werb iven of the arrest of a man named Lemaire for murder and. other crimes committed in the department of tho Aisne; and of lhis hanng more than once effected his escape from prison under most extraordinary circumstanoes anrd beenreoaptured. A man named Hugot was captured about the same time as his accomplice in the murders, and from the investigation mado by the authorities it turned out that they formed part of a band which had for a long time been in the habit of committing robberies and other crlmes in the departments of the Somme and Aisne. After a while the rest of the band, 12 in number, were taken into custody. Yesterday the trial of these 14 persons com3menced before the Conrt of Assizes of the Aisne, and excited extraordinary interest. It Is expected to last several days, as the offences of which the prisoners are accused are numerous, and as not fewer than 136 witnesses have baen summonedi to givo evidence. The indictment, which is of very great length, begins by giving a brief desoription of the different prisoners. Of Lemaire, the chief, it said that, though only 25 years of age, he is a most desperate criminal, and took real pleasure in the perpetration of crimes wihich wrere attended with danger; ho thought nothing of murder, and, declared that "he would murder a thousand people without caring a straw !" Btugot was described, as a most dangerous malefactor, possessng great skldl in cutting holes through wals and the peculiar faculty of seeing in th dark as well asIn the light ; he hsd no hesitation, it wag added, in committing murder when it would facilitate robbery. The third, prisoner, a man named Bomrse, 48 years of age, was repre sented to have passed not fewer than 30 years in prison The fourth, the real chief of the band, since it was he who planned the execation of most of the crimes, was a publichonse keeper named Villet, of Vrely, who in early life served in the Royal Guard at the Restoration, and was employed in the stables of Marshal iIarmont. He was described as of considerable intelligence, with Feat cnnning,and as of a very pompous style ofspeech,one o his most frequent expresslons since his arrest having been:-" I defy all the seven sages of Greece and all the magicians of Egypt to prove me guilty!" and another being:-" Hngot is a murderer, his head belongs to Jupiter I' With Villet were associated his wife, daughter, and son, and a cousin named Jean, aU of whom he was alleged to have drawn Into crime. The other prisoners, who are the wife of Hugot, a carpenter named Psllot, a brickmakor named labache, a weaver named Prevost, a dealer in rabbitsklins named Caron, and a tradesman camed Popin, are stated to be of indifferent character. The indictment goes on to detail the various crimes alleged to have been committed by the .band, and the precise share each had in them.. On the 27th of June, 1852, Hugot and Prosper Villet, son of Villet, com. nitted a burglary in the house of a farmer named Bourse, of Vrcly. In gepternber of the same year two incendiary fires occurred at Vrely and Wiencourt l'Equip6e, and It was alleged that they were occasioned by Vilet and his son; their reason being to defraud insurance companies, either for their own direct profit, or for the benefit of per. eons who owed them money, and by whom they hop-d to be paid. The next crime was the murder on the 30th of November, 1852, of one Chretien, at Vrely, and it was alleged to have been committed by ViUet and his cousintheir object being to possess themselves of a considerable sum of money the Tictim had. The indiotment then detailed a long series of robberies and burglaries at Parvilliers, Lignieres, Mailly-Raineral, Beaucourt, Marbonniares, Thory, Montdidier, and not fewer than 29 other villages - the booty Consisting of oxen, clothing, lnen, tools, agricultural implements, various sums In notes and gold, &o. In each of these crimes one or other of the prisoners participated, either as perpetrators or as receivers of the booty. The next crime In chronological order was the murder at Edrancourt, on the 5th of December, 1855, of a farmer named Deschamps, and the steaUng from him of a large sum in gold and notes which he had received at a fair in the town. This murder was marked by extra ordinary audacity on theo part ofi the per petrators. After concluding his business at the fair Desehamps went wvith his son, at about 6 o'clockr, to acafe in the ont;drt of the town, and after drinking with him and a friend for about half an hour went out. He never returned, and on bemg sought for was not found. The next morning his dead body was discovered in a sheep pen at a short distance from the house; he had, it appeared, been suddenly felled to the ground by a tremendous blow on the baok of the head, andhadthnbeen stamped on until his skull was little more than amass of jelly ! This murder was, it was alleged, committed by Bonrse, Iemaire, and Hugot, and it was added that Villet and his wife had been privy to it, and had recelved part of the stolen money. Robberies at LaboissiMre, Lihons, Arvillers, and Bouchoir, as6erted to havo been committed by Lemaire, Hugot, Villet, and Fillot, were next detailed. The last crime mentioned in the indictment was the murder of a couple named Thory, of Les Foliee, on the 6th of April, 1856. This couple were found lying dead with their skulls smashed in a most frightful muaner; the drawersandclosets in their honse had been ransacked and their more valuable contents had been taken away, but bills and other securities to the amount of 16,935f. had, though they had evidently been exauiined by the murderers, been left, no doubt because an attempt to put them into circulation might have led to detection. This murder and robbery turned out on investigation to have been committed by Bugot and Lemaire. The indictment concluded by samming up the crimes alleged to have been committed by each of the accused:-Lemairt, 2 murders and 42 robberies or burglaries; Hugot, 2 murders and 54 robberies or burglaries; Bourse, 1 murder and 1 robbery; Villet, 1 murder, 2 incendiary fires, 29 robberies; *rosper Villet, 2 incendiary fires and 1 robbery; Jean Villet, t maurder and robbery; the other accused, various robceries or receiving stolen goods. After the indictment wras read the court adjourned for the interrgtoty of the prisoners.-GcZig7uessi fcsscn~r,

The sub-con. tract provides for the completioz of the works in the month of August next, The land settlements have beoa made mostly on terms favoarable to the company, the proprietors and tenants generally having evinced every desira to accommodate the comDany. The directors, on behalf of +-he company, have agroed to subscribe 2501. towadrc the erection of a bridge over the river Don opposite the Kenmay -station, which cannot fail to add to the traffic on the line. The capital account to the 31st of A ugust last showved that l 14,4471. hadl been received and 13,551g. expended, leaving aj BANFF, MACDUFF, AND TURRIFF JUNCITON. The report of the directors of this company states that the' *opening of the line, owing to the death of the late contractor for the works and other circumstancos, was not accomplished till the 5th of September last; bat the works have een sub3tantially completed by his representatives. The traffic since the opening affords the prospect of a moderate dividend for the current year; The works on the Turriff and BanffExtensions Railway havo been commenced, and on their completion a continuous line of railway comtnunlcation wll be opened up between Banff and Macduftfand the south. The capital account to the 31st of August last showed that 109.549&. bed been r3ceived and 129,4071. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 19,8581. INVERNESS AND ABERDEEN JUNCTIOX. The directors of this company state in their report that since the hast half-yearly meeting the works along thoe whole line have msdo satisfactory progit6s. The viadutt across the Nairn is nearly completed. The foundations for the most Important piers in the river Findhorn have been ;ecured on solid rock, and the -Sey vduct iswell ad. vance. .

GREAT NORTH OF SCOTLAND. Thereport of the directors of this company statesthat the traffic receipts for the year ending the 31st of August last amounted to 69,1844, and the expenditure to -32,6671., in cludlng 9,7561C. for interest on loans, leaving, with 5661 from last accont, a balance of 27,0831. .From this ie deducted 14,5541., the interest on the 5per .cent. preference shares and 12, 4591. for the proposed divideid on the originalshares at 4. per cent., leaving 701. for themiext tcount. The pay. moets on construction aDcount dating the past year amounted to 32,3421. The net receipts of the past year on revenue account exhibit an increase of 10,000. over thoso of the previous.year, whUe the worldng expenses, exclusive of fen-duties, rates, and taxesg -are only 34 per cent, or, inclusive of these, 39 per cent., sa compared with 38 and 42 per oent. respectively for the- preceding year." These results justify the directors in recommending a dividend of 6 percent. on. the preference, and of 4A per oent. on the original shares of the company. The gros traffic for the fist eight weeks of the current finiancial year is 2,6001. in. exoss of the corresponding period of last year. The line and works from Aberdeen to Huntly are iimaintjlned in excellent order Under the company's superlitendent. The'line frominuntly to Xeith has been upheld during the year by the contractors, but It will In future be inaitaned by the company. The line reoeives a sensible acoession ,of traffic from the Ban, Macdaff, and Tarriff Junction Railway, which was opened for trafflc on the 5th of September last, and the receipts on which, since its opening, afford the prospect of a, fair aividend on the shares held by the company in that undertaking. It is' expected that the Inver. ness and Aberdeen Junction -Railway will be opened throughout for traffic by this time next year. The contract for the works on the Alford VaUey Railway, which forms a junctlon with the main lina at Kintore, provides for the completion of the works in the month of August next. The directors retain the opinion that the company should cooperate in promoting the BiU of the Formartine and fluchan Railway id the ensuing session of Parliament, and that the subscription of 5Q0001. should be continued. The share and loan account shows that 1,107,4101. was authorized to be raised on shares, and bd0,0001, onx loans, together, 1,407,4401. ; of which 606,855?. -had beett raised on shares, and 248,963 by loans, together, 855,8191., leaving power to raise the balance of 551,6211 The capital account to the 31st of Auguet showed that 816,6521. bad been reeived, and 846,3181. expended, including 84,6491. paid for an estate and subscribed towards nine branch railway undertakings, leaving a balance against tho company of 29,6651.

The V1cn-CEwczLOB ssid the University statute gays no power to Trinrity Colege to touch the Ptofeorship,. The opinion of the Commissioners had Ieen taken. and ther had given a decided opion to that effect.

EXKMAOIRDINAY FIGIT.-Our reader3 doubtlesa noticed, a fewr days back, an account of a tiger which escaped from a cattle truck in RatCliff.highway, London, and which, after running along the centre of the road for some distance, was caught by his keepers while in the act of tearing a lad who uanfortunately crossed the animars path. The tiger was the property of Mr. Jamrach, and he sold it a day or two afterwards to Mr. Edmionds, the successor of Wombwell, for his well-known trvelling menagerie, whieh it joined on Monday at WestBromwich. It was pluced ih one of the ordin carriages, one of two compartments, the adjoining den being occupied by a very fine lion, six or sevenyears old, for which Mr. Edmonds gave 3001. three years ago. The attondante had al left the menagerie to gO to breakfast, when suddenly those in the carriage which the proprietors ocoupy were alarmed by an nnusual outcry snaong the beasts. They soon discovered the caus The rewvly-hought tiger had burglariously broken through the "slide" or partition dividing his den from that of tho lion, end had the latter in his terrible grasp. The combat which c nsned was a terrific one. The lion acted chiefly on the dofenoive, and having probably been considerably tamed by bis tbree years' confiemen' the tiger bad the advantag. His attacks were of the most ferocious kind. The llon'smane saved his head and neck from being much injured, but the savage assailant at last succeeded in ripplEn up his beUy, and then tho poor animal was at the tnge,s mercy.

LONDON, TUESDAY, NOVEM3BER 10, 1857. Nothing makes this country more feverish than any long interruption in the communications between the Government and the public. However prosperous may be our aafairs, however easy the movement of the State machine, yet if we hear nothing of Ministers and their doings for some months there is a tendency to curiosity, uneasiness, and almost to suspicion. The quiet child is instinctively supposed to be in mischief; the rulers who are saying nothing are thought necessarily to be planning or plotting, unless, indeed, they aro absolutely inattentive to their duties. Even the calm is irritating to a nation which likes publicity and movement. So a Ministerial speech on the 9th of November has become an institution among us. The Show, with its banners and men in armour, the swearing in by the Judges, and the great banquet in the evening are not more certainly expected than the little oration by the :P1MIER when he acknowledges the toast of "HI DIAJESTY's Mfinisters." It marks the commencement of the Mbinisterial year. In old days :arliament met about this time, and the London season accorded more with that of Continental capitals. But now the session is deferred to February, and the Minister has only an agricul. iral meeting or the opening of a mechanics institute at which to remark on the state of the nation and to indicate his future policy. The LonRD DI&YoR!s Feast therefore preeents itself at the right moment. The world has returned from the country and the seaside, from Switzerland and the German baths. Ministers have begun to think of next year's business, haveheld one or two Cabinet Councils, and can form some notion of what is expected and what can be done in the ensuing session. A visit to the First Magistrate of the capital gives a fitting opportunity for making that review of the past and those announcements of the future which reassure and gratify the public. Far more than usual is the interest at the present time, when the greatest dependency of the empire is a prey to mutiny and rebellion. On any occasion a speech from a PrimeMinister must excite attention-much more no when that Minister is Lord PMEnSTOoN, and the hour that of a great military and finamcial crisis. Lord PA.SMnTOZeS speech last evening was Fatisfactory, although it contained nothinug new or unexpected. The country has of late begun to look for the speedy end of the calamities in India. The capture of Delhi, the maiLtenance of authority throughout the Punjab, the Bombay and Mradras Presidencies, and the safety of Bengal Proper have made us sanguine; yet we are all glad to have our hopes confirmed from the lips of one who has the fullest information, and speaks under the strictest responsibility. Some have thought that too hopeful a view has been taken by the press and I the public. Alihough they admit that no serious danger menaces the empire,-that the Sepoys, without a base of operations, without military stores, without an able chief, must befinally crushed,-they have yet thought that the work must be one ol months, and that armed bands might scour the country like the hordes of the Mahrattas, avoiding a contest with Us, yet harassing our troops and plundering our subjects. It may be said that the PREmIa in this case can know no more than the public, yet he at least may be allowved to strengthen the opinions of those who take a cheerful view. Lord PALm=STON, then, believes that the mutiny will shortly be suppressed, and that the time for punishing the guilty and rewarding the faithful is near at hand. But the passage in which the public will be the most interested relates to the present state of the national defences. England has despatched within the last few months the largest army that ever left her shores. In fact, we doubt whether ever before in the history of the world a nation sapported a force of between 80,000 and 90,000 men at a distance of 14,000 miles from its territory; and this is accomplished by a people which makes no parade of military strength, which even, in obedience to an invincible habit of self-depreciation, speaks of itself as not a miiUtay nation. What is more wonderful is, that the whole of this great force is raised by voluntary enlistment-not to lounge in barrack-yards at home, not to go on a short expedition promising plunder and self-indulgence, but to fight during years the battles of their country in a distant land, among strange and hostile races, and under the blazing sun of Southern Asia. Yet it is not out of a starving and desperate population that this great army is recruited, but in a counh,y which has for many years past been advancing with long atrides in the path of prosperity; in a country where thewages of labour are the highest in Europe, and where the inducements to an industrial life are great and manifold. This country, then, would have reason to be proud if even by denuding its garrisons of troops and trusting solely to its private citizens such a force could be sent abroad. But what shal we say to the fact wbich Lord PAL=RsToN announced, that, in spite of this great and unprecedented drain of men, the recruiting has been so successful that we have actually in arms within the limits of the British Islands a larger force than before the news of the mutiny reached us? This is indeed a most happy corroboration of the Duke of CAMBRIDGi's announcement some time past. At that time the recruiting was going on at the rate of considerably more than a thousand a-week, and it seems that since that time the impulse has rather gathered strength than become weakened. The acquaintance with the Indian atrocities afforded by the newspapers and the exertions of the more ciucated have evidently roused a strong spirit among the young and adventurous of the working dlasses. The better treatment and the higher consideration which the private soldier may now expect have also, we cannot doubt, become known bhroughout the country, and we have the result in a greater willingness to serve. With pride might the PnzanXn aunounce that "w e have now under " arms in the lJnited Kingdom as many fighting "men as we had before the news of the mutiny "reached Usi," and well might he follow it up by a warning to all our foes, open or concealed. "If," said he, "any foreign nation ever dreamed " that the exertions which we were compelled "to make abroad had lessened our strength at "home, and that the time had arrived when a "different bearing might be exhibited towards us "from that which was safe in the moment of our "strength, the manner in which our ranks have "been filled will teach the world that it would not "be a safe game to play to attempt to take advan- "tage of that which wa3 erroneously imagined to "be the moment of our weakness." The cheers with which this declaration was greeted will be echoed by the public generally. It is indeed necessary for this country to hold without flinching for a moment its position in Europe. The spirit manifested by those beside whom we fought two short years since is well known to the world, and we can well appreciate the advice given to us by a foreign critic, to remember the feeling with which we are regarded, and to trust in ourselves alone. This we have done, and will do. We are quite able unassisted to manage the affairs of our own empire, and that is not Ill. Even in the crisis of domestic tumult we will not forego an iota of our just European influence. Tbis country wil express its opinions and make them prevail, even though 80,000 savages are murdering and ravaging through the richest province of the East. Lord PALMEnSTO1r concluded by a tribute to the courage and judgment of Lord CAxmiG. Enough has, we think, been said for the preeent both for and against the GovEnwon-GmzERn. That he should be violently attaoked Is but a natural consequence of the position which the Calcutta Government occapies with respet to the Indian press and the independent Anglo-Indian public. What Lord CANNING has achieved can hardly as yet be measured. One thing is at least in his favour, -his measures have been followed by complete success. A party wil deny that the success is due to the measures, but they will have to prove their case. The acts of a statesman cannot be judged singly, and without reference to the whole system of events and circumstances. Only when some act runs counter to common sense and instinctive feellng can we blame with confidence. Such an act the pardon of the Cawnpore mutineers by Mr. GRANT undoubtedly would be. If, then, the report of this affair be confirmed, the GovnWoRGENERAL has by his subordinates been guilty of error. But as regards his whole career we may. without undue partiality, acquiesce in a favourable view. Iord CANINxG, at least, has the confidence of the Government, and those who are responsible for the event may be fairly left to deal with the agent. Lord OCAxsx, too, will have acquired no little experience in his hard and perilous noviclMte; and, as we believe it is certain that within a year the great corporation which has conquered India will pass away, and leave its dominions to the immediate control of the Cnowx and Parliament, the services of one who has seen and learnt Bo much as Lord CAxxrsG will not be usoless in the establishment of the new order of things.
There are differences of opinion as to whether the experiment of the Exeter Hall Sermons has Bucceeded. The Rall has been always crowded, the congregation has been attentive, and there has been a proper but not an undue amount of religious excitement. So far there has been success. On the other hand, it is said by some that the classes for which the sermons were intended did not go to hear them, and that the congregation was obtained by thinning the parochial churches of the metropolis, and especially of the neighbourhood. It is difficult to say how the truth lies with regard to these facb, il conseq-aence of the general teudency t'Uq- ia to state facts as the bias of opinion one way or another dictates, but, perhaps, for the sake of peace and quietness, we m'ny admit that the Hall does not seem to have attracted so many of those wanderers from the fold for whose sake it was opened as was expected. The congregation, according to some, was too well dressed. On the other hand, we cannot from tolerable bonnets and shawls and respectable coats in London infer with any certainty constant churcbgoing habits. There are ill-dressed wanderers and well-dressed wanderers. But, however the late experiment at Exeter Hall may have succeeded, there can be no doubtthat such experiments are defensible, are proper, and that it ought to be in the power of the authorities of the Church to make them. There can be no doubt that the collection of masses of people together to join in public prayer and listen to gifted and stirring preachers ought to lie within our ecclesiastical machinery. This is a very natural and important part of the functions and resources of a Church,-the use and application of the gift of preaching possessed by her ministers-the power of bringing this gift to bear upon the largest number, and in the most convenient and effective way. Every religious community must have the free use of its gifts if it is to obtain influence snd win hearts. If it is shackled in the exercise of them, it is so far paralyzed. No religious body the tongue of which is. tied has a fair chance. Lf the most powerful and awakening gift that a Church possesses-the gift of speechis so curtailed and restricted by technical rules that it has not natural play,-if the appeal to the human heart, the power of addressing men on the subject of religicn, rousing feeling, eliciting instinct, awakening conscience,-if this great gift is hemmed in by a whole circle of petty, arbitrary distinctions and prohibitions which just prevent its most effective exercise,-it is a sad case for a Church to be in. It stands to reason, then, that the authorities of the Church ought to have the power of arranging those extraordinary displays of the gift of preaching for which Exeter Hall has lately been used. It is very well to ssy that the Church has her ordinary parochial preaching, but she ought to have the ordinary and the extraordinary too. Some people do not want excitement, others want excitement, and can only be reached at all by some demonstration rather out of the common way. We should have both means at work. It is clear that those with whom the executive of the Church rests should have the power of providing these extraord{nary means for awakening religious feeling, and getting at those classes which the ordinary resources of the Church do not touch. It is very little to ask that a Bishop in his own diocess should have the power of inviting a few stirring preacher arranging a series of discourses, and giving them for the occasion the most convenient building he can find, and one which will hold the largest number of people. If he cannot do this he is only half a Bishop, he has not the proper natural means at his disposal which the head of a diocess ought to have, and he is unfairly and incorrecty charged with the responsibilities of a whole spiritual department, for the wants of which he cannot provide owing to some legal disability. But such a very natural, necessary, reasonable, and moderate power as this, residing in the Bishop of a diocess, is totally inconsistent with the veto which Mlr. EDouAnr, as incumbent of the parish in which Exeter Hall is situated, has just claimed upon the celebration of the Exeter Hall service. Mr. EDOtuART claims the legal right of stopping these services, as being an interference with the supremacy of the incumbent in his own parish, and takes his stand upon the rock that no clergyman of the Church has a right to preach within the confines of any parish except with the consent and permission of the incumbent. This may be correct ecclesiastical law; we doubt if it is common law; but, if it is, it is high time it should be altered. Such a right is, as we say, absolutely inconsistent with the natural power which a Bishop ought to have in his diocess. If a Bishop is to have the power of arrAnging any such extraordinary celebrations as these, these celebrations must take place somewhere or other, in some parish or other, and therefore to say that any incumbent has the right to stop them if they take place in Iis parish, is imply to say that the Bishop has no full power to set them going in any parisbh. The abstraction of such a power from the responsible executive of the Church is an absurdi-y in itself, but the absurdity is still worse when we consider that such a rule lodges the power of stopping the most effective appeals and demonstrations of a Church in mere chance handsthe hands of the particular private clergyman in 'whose parish the only suitable building for the purpose happens to be. It is perfectly monstrdus to say that a mere individual should have such a power as this-that a simple private clergyman should of his own paltry whim or scruple be enabled to thwart the public desig-ns of a Bishop for his diocess, and suppress a powerful and a large and well-considered means of spiritual benefit. There is nothing to be said for such a right, and the existence of it in the present instance can only lead to the total and very speedy abolition of it. We may add, th-t this abolition will take place by general consent, by the unanimous voice of the public, the Church, and all parties in the Church. l'he public can only see in such a parochial right as this an antiquated obstacle to the Church's efficiency, and therefore the public will not object. The Evangelical party will not object, because these services have beea a hobby of theirs. The High Church party of course will not object, because epiEcopal power is a hobby of theirs. Obedience to Bishops is one of their most sacred and fixed tenets, and, though they claim an exception from this duty in matters of doctrine, on which the humblest Christian has a right to stand up for truth against the proudest prelate, the exception would not apply in the present case, which is not one of doctrine, but one of external arrangement and ecclesiastical machinery only. They will, of course, therefore, be in favour of the abolition of such a power as this in a mere presbyter to resist a Bishop. It is true these particular services mayhave not been quime to their liking with regard to the tone of the discourses and the names of the preachers. But this has nothing to do with the general question. Upon that they will be clear ;-they will not be so untrue to their own principles as to deny that a Biahop ought to have in his diocess such a power as the Bishop of LoNoDN now claims. With the public, then, the Church, and all parties in the Church unanimous against such a right as that now put forward by the incumbent of the parish in which Exeter Hall is, it is very apparent that the days of such a right are now numbered, and that Mr. EDOuART and his veto will soon be left in an Infinitesimal minority.

It is generally thought that we are very well off in our huge metropolis. We have the most energetic population and the most cultivated society in the world; spite of smoke, fog, and the filth of oar river, we enjoy excellent health; our markets are supplied with the best provisions of the country; aJl the luxuries of the Continent find their way to our vaults; we have the most perfect police system ti,at has yet been devised ;-With thv, and a thou- sand other advantages, what more can we want, and what is there to complain of ? We have one great misery, and it is becoming intolerable-it is at times even sufficient to destroy all the other acomforta of our lot, and make an inh%bitant of the most luxurious city in the world long for the life of a savage in some impenetrable solitude at the sources of the Nile, or amid the snows of Greenland. We are afflicted every hour of the day, and almost every hour of the night, with a succession of excruciating noises, sometimes like the shrieking of PuxcR, intended for our pleasure ; sometimes like the shouting of newsvendors, intended for our profit, but always effective in giving to a residence in London the character of a perpetual pilgrimage such as poor CH=TiAff had to undertake through that Dark Valley in which his ears were assailed with the raving and roaring, the groaning and moaning, of a legion of devils and human wretches for ever lost. In all seriousness, it is impossible to exaggerate this nuisance. There are persons who regard the complaints of those who suffer from this mode of torture with ridicule rather than commiseration. Happy men who are deaf as adders and can afford to laugh I They have ruled us too long, and it is time that, in spite of the caricatures of HoaATrT, we should protest against a nuisance which is every day becoming more serious, and from which there is absolutely no protection save by further legislative enactment. There is no protection, we say, for the ear is the most helpless faculty we have. It is at once the weakest and the most wonderful, the most ethereal and the most persecuted of our senses. It is a matter of choice whether we shall taste or touch anything; we can shut our eyes or turn them avw,ay; we can overpower one odour with another but hear we must, at all times and in all places. It is the most acute of aU our senses; it is the last that sleeps at night ; it is the first that wakes in the morning ; and, as it is capable of more intense enjoyment than any other, so also it is liable to more exquisite suffering. A sense thus delicately constituted we subject day and night to a torture which is very nearly equivalent to cutting off a malefactor's eyelids, and then crucifying him with his face to the sun. There is no possibility of escaping the din. This is the only very great and universal nuisance in London, but it is so great as not only to affect Londoners with a chronic irritation which is destructive of health as well as of pleasure, but also to convey to strangers their invariable idea of the metropolis, expressed in that name suggestive of deafening noises and meaningless clamour--Babel. Now, the point to be observed is, that all the worst nuisances of the kind to which we allude are quite unnecesSary. It would be well if we could avoid the crash of the vehicles that, rolling like a battery of thunderbolts along our principal thoroughfares, seem to evoke a shriek from every stone as they pass. We have tried wooden pavement, iron pavement, and Macadam, and we have been obliged again to return to stone. -unfortunately, the noise of the vehicles is inevitable; but it is not of this that we complain so much as of the cries and the music which infest the best streets, and particularly if they are called quiet streets, whether in Belgravia, Tyburnia, or Mayfair. If the roar of Cheapside or Fleet-street is bad, the clatter of some retired terrace or secluded crescent named after one of the Marquis of WEsrmnwsTsr's country seats is ten times worse. In the one there is something of a rhythmiic movement-it suggests the roaring of the waves as they break on the shore, or of the wind rushing through a mighty forest, and in consequence of its monotony we learn to forget it at last. In the other there is that variety and complication by which the torment renews itself continually, and with increased violence. After the Parcels' Delivery van has rattled past there comes the cry of "Beer I" then of " Milk !" suddenly an organ breaks upon the scene; then a shout of " Bandboxes r1 then of "' Baskets !" then the organ again; it is the turn of the old clothesman next; after him comes a Lascar beating on a drum; the strains of Ebhiopian Serenaders from the publichouse round the corner soon float upon the ear; PuNcH squeaks past to add to the harmony; the Frenchman and his dogs set up a howling in the distance; a German brass baud creates discord upon system, and as it grows towards dusk a host of " roaring vagabonds" line the streets, shouting one against the other-" Im" portant news from India !"-" Relief of Luck" now 1"-" Glorious victoryof GeneralAvAEocx P1 But what of all this must be accepted as necessary? Who in these quiet streets and fashionable squares has within human memory been known to buy of a hawker, unless it be some unhappy servant on board wages in frenzied search of excitement while the family is out of town ? And yet hawkers succeed each other in such regular and frequent intervals that no street is ever without one shouting at the top of a practised voice stale lettuce, or fish, or lobsters. Then for the music, who wants it, and who pays for it ? Does i' bring solace to the soul of JFLxs- ? Does it put life into the calves of JoHN THoMrAs ? It may be useful to the cook, in teaching her the airs of the laLU opera, and it may be gratifying to Buro.s to see h;s master roused into fury; but cert-inly nobody else can desire it, and not even these worthy people can desire it for sixteen hours a-day. What, then, is to be done, at present we are quite helpless ? If even the fashionable quarter, the residence of our Ministers and our Parliament, is as unable to protect itself from these nuisances as from the smoke itself, what must Bloomsbury and Fitzroy squares endure ? There seems no relief, for on Saturday last aQ Bow-street, when one of theinhabitants of University-street, who had previously in India suffered much from brain fever, complained of the distress which the constant grinding of the street organs gave him, the organ-grinder was dismissed merely on his promise not to play again in the same street. Whatever may have been advisable in this particular case, it is evident that the whole tribe are, as a general rule, dealt with by far too leniently, and that the Belgravians, in preparing a petition for Parliament praying that these adventurers should be dealt with as beggars, have not moved in the matter a day too soon. They are not agitating, bz it remembered, for a whim, for an idle pleasure. There is nothing, we believe, which interferes so materially with health as the privation of all rest and the mental irritation which our street cries snd music create; and in many parts of the town thera can be little doubt that the eternal hubbub of hawkers and itinerant musicians is a far more potent cause of ill-health than the bad drainage and universal smoke of which we hear so much. We can trace fever and cholera directly to the want of ventilation, to the impurity of water, or to the presence of home noxious exhalation; but the discordant cries of our streets affect us through the mind, and the sinling of the nervous system, which is attributed to excitement or over-exertion, might often with more truth be accounted for by the want of a really quiet home. The fact is, the Police Act must be amended, and householders protected from an evil which threatens to make london uninhabitable, for no one's profit but t) supply a miserable existence to a race who are tempted to eke out the nefarious gains which they earn from the torture of sober citizens by other processes which are still more nefarious, but; perlhaps1 more easy t9 boar,
AMERICA [A. summary of the following appeared in our second edition of yesterday :-] LIVEUPOO4~ MoN~Dky. The Royal Mlail steanship Asia, Lott commander, arrived this morning with advices from New York to the 28th ult., and $98,274 and 2531. in specie. The Royal Mail steamship Persia arrived out at New York on the day the Asia sailed. The Board of 'Underwriters at New York had increased the premium on treasure from San Francisco to 2 per cent. The New York Shipping and Commer.al List, referring to the manner in which mercantile men had a-cepted the "I situation," says- I It is pleasing to witness, in these 'hard timeEs' the esp,r-i de corps that animates the great body of our business men The stern and iwcompromising modo in which obligations are in ordinary times exacted has appaently gtven way before the more considerate Course, made Imperative, it may be, by self-preservation, but still admitting the higher motives of forbearance and kindlinmss. Suffering under a oommon embarrassment the amenities of life have largely tempered the harshness of trade maxims. Mutual accommodations are made wherever practicable, and in hundreds of cases oonoessions have been yielded and even tendered, for which the only retarn wras in the general good, and in the dedre to benefit and oblige. It may be doubted whether in the whole history of commerce so many striking instances could be found in so brief a period in which the nobler and more generous dictatesof humanity softened the rigour of trade rues and diminished the force of precedents. The great majorilty of those who have been compelled to yield to the fury of the blast have beca treated leniently, and the dismay of bankruptcy has been relieved by the sympathy of the public. Indeed, many who have been compeiled by imperous circumstances to swpsend cannot consistently be called bankrupt, inasmuch as the assets saved from the wreck will furnish v basis for the resumption of business on tho abatement of the pressure." When the Asia sailed a severe storm was raging at Boston and along the cost. The Reindeer, a lake steamer, had been lost off Big Point au Sable; 21 persons perished. She was caught in a storm, but was doing well until a sea cane aboard and extinguished the fires. The captain then ran her for the land, which she struck about midnight. Almost immediately a heavy breaker broke over her, and washed away 21 persons; only two firemen escaped. The Camden (Arkans8) Herald chronicles the burning of two negroes for the alleged violation and murder of an old woman. While at the stake one of the negroes aecused a white mai named Miller, who was a spectator, of having excited him to the deed; the other negro protested his innocence to the last. Considerable damage had been occasioned to agricultural produce in the valley of the Mohawk by an inundation. The New York Courier and LEnquir-er of the latest date gives the followinng summary of the state of financial affairs *F Tho demand for biUs on Europe yesterday and to-day is quite light. The rates are favourable enough to remitters, hut the extreme searcity of money disables most persons from purchmsing. Theindebtednessof our merchant3 to Eng. land, France, and Germany is nece6sarily deferred in large amounts, and at the same time heavy remittances of gold from abroad are anticipated at this port. Bankers' bills at 60 days on London to-day are abundant at 105 to 106. Good commercial bills from Southern cities, well-known signatures, are freely offered at 100, equivalent to 9 or 94 discount Some relief is looked for in this market from the promised shipments of coin from EDgland. It would be better for us to rely upon our own domestio resources, and not add to the disturbance 'which is feared in Western Europe. Every 1,0001. in gold shipped from England to the United States will be returned in a few months, without contributing any solid or permanent relief to our own moneymarket. The question of the suspension of the Bank of England and the Bank of France is canvassed freely in financlal ircles here, and such an event Is by Eome looked upon as of slight moment. We cannot, however, but oonsider such an event as a public calamity-one that would work irreparable injury to the commercial world, and do no possible good to any parties whatever. It is for this reason that we hope the Banlks in England and Franoe will be fully sustained, and that the export of coin to the United States will be less than is generally mentioned. Now York will be looked to hereafter, as heretofore, as the pivot upon which remmption will rest. A wise, conciliatory, concerted movement on the part of the banks of this city will, if adopted, relieve our merchants and strengthen the former. The banks cannot afford to lose much moro by mereantile failures; their object should, therefore, be to act together in sustaning the merchants, without whose assistance and confi. dence the moneyed institutions of the city and State cannot be kept in existence. Whatever course New York parsues will have a wide induence upon New Bnglond, Pennsylvania, Maryland; and, thraugh them, upon the South and West. New York, therefore, has a great responsibility in this matter, and its action will be felt throughout the country. If the banks wish to recover their lost ground, they must act more leniently and wisely -they must a^t together and harmonioasly. There is no remson why a few should expand (as last week) and the majority curtail. It is this unsteady and uncertain policy that brought about the crisis two weeks ago. There were rumours to-day of several additional failures, hut they were not authenticated. Extension is the order of the day, and one wisely agreed upon by creditors generally. There are very few housea that have not found it necessary to ask and to take time on their liabilities. The West and South in tuin exact the sa'no indulgence from Now York. The former will be able to discharge their indebtedness by means of the large cropa of the year; the South will realize less from the new crop o! cotton than was articipated. It is conoeded that a heavy decline must occur in the market values throughout Europe, and that manufacturers will require a more limited supply than heretofore. Gold was recently in pressing demand, but has now become a mere drug, heavy on the market. The brokers are paying onehalf per cent. premium for limited sums, but this premium is nominal. Large amounts are offered at the same rate and rejected. In Philadelphia, exchange on New York Is quoted 3.j to 4i promium, and draughts on Baltimore 3 to 4 discount. There is no reason for this discrepancy. Baltimore current funds are just as good as Philadelphia or New York bankable fands, and will, at quite as early a day as here, be convertible into coin at pa-. The following are the quotations for specie by bullion and specie brokers at Philadelphia, payable in bankab1e funds - American half-dollars, old, 107; ditto, quarters, old, 1 04; American gold, old coinage, 1 08; sovereigns, 4 95 ; Mexican dolars, 103; South American, 1 06; Spanish par dollars, 112; five francs, 99; German crowns, 1 09; French crowns, 1 I1; Napoloons 20 francs, 3 90; ten guilder pieceb, 4 05; ten thaler pieces, 8 00; Spaunsh doubloons, 16 00.; Patriot doubloons, 15 80; ducats, 2 25 American gold, 4 to 5; New York Exchange, 3A to 4A; thero is no variation in the brokers' rates for tlim-e bill. Unexceptionable paper at two to four months is freely offereda 2to 3 per cent. per month, paper that would under ordinary circumstances be acceptablo to the banks, and which they could now tke %;th advantage to themselves. At last the moray comes out of the banks, for every bil discounted at the broker's lessens the bank deposits. The stock-market to-day showed a decidedly buoyant feeling, and most of the sales were made at a large advance on the quotations of the past week and of yesterday. IUlnois Central showed the largest increase. Illtnois Central Stock advanced from 77V to 83. lhlnois Central Bonds weTe quoted at 60 on Friday last, and to-day sales were made at 75&.

Notwithstandingtheunfavourable accounts from abroad,there appear to be signs of reviving confidence, which must be improved as soon as we can effect a rapid movement of the abundant agricultural products of the country from the interior to the eaboard. There is little or no paper selling at the discount houses, and the rates for first-clas notes may be quoted 2, 3, and 5 per cent. a-month. Stooks have taken an upward turn, but the business is comparatively light The prospects now for a wlnter business on the New York railroads and the lending Western lines are excellent, and furnish a basis for a rise in stocks at a no distant period. The bank statement is more favourable than generaly erx p3cted, though the contraction of loans in the face of a gain of nearly a million and a quarter of specie meets with but little fAvour; the clty circulAtion has gone down rapidly, which is owing mainly to the voluntary practice adopted of substituting country imoney in payments acros, the counter. The policy of withdrawing the city Dotes is not a general one, someo of the banks holding It to be to their interest nowr and on resumpt,ion to sustain a good, clrculation of their otvn.

It shows how little is the value of the best calculations that the great embarrassment of the last session of Congress was to Dro. vide the means of depleting the Treaury, and members were warned of the terrible consequenoes of adjourning without some measure to arrest this accumulation In the vaults of the Government. The policy of the Administra. tion is to avert the neoessity of a loan by making retrenchments, The President, it is given out, will opose all money bills, except those for indispensable appropilations. Directions have been gtven to revise and reduce all estimates, and the construction of Custom-hous and many other public works will be suspended at an early day." The same paper remarks:- " That speculation and over-trading have told with severe effect in Europe duriDg the years that the same have been so rampant in the Urnited States is very true. But it must be remembered that the accamulated capital there, and especially in Great Britain, is enormous. Much of the gold that has gone away from us remains there, and adds to the strength of the great mercantile and manufacturing jite. rests. As the balance of trade is oonstntly in favour of Europe, the wealth of that portion of the world must not only be large, but must have been greatly on the increase during the years that have followed the discovery of gold in Calirornia aud Australia. It is also undeniable that though the business men of the leading eommercd towns of Great Britain and Europe have not the mme resiliency, the same recuperative energy, as those of the United States, yet from their greater Capital and resources, they do not so readily yield to pressure and go under. Once down they do not easily get up again; but while stil on their feet they bear much, and henoe we do not greatly fear any general suspension will be brought about on the other side by American embarrassments. Some chock, and an important one, will doubtless be experienced, but not snfficient to gtop lIrgely the orders for staple," The New York TJomnal of Conimerce states that the exports (exclusive of specie) from New York to forelgn ports for the week showed an excs of nearly $500,000 as compared with the total for the corresponding date of last year. A despatch from Washington reports that the banks of the district of Columbia had reselved to receive the notes of the following banks as currency :-Bank of the Metropolis, Bank of Washington, and Patriotic Bank, of Washington; Balk of Commerce, and Farmers' and Mechanis' Bank, of Georgetown; and all the banks of Baltimore. At -New York there was no demand for cotton either for export or home use; the market was still a blnk. " Hitherto," says the best authority, "At this season of the year our home spinners have been accustomed to make heavy purchases, whereas at present they re sellers, owing to the depressed condition of the goods-market. Thus, instead of competing with their English rivals in the cotton ports of the soutb, our rmanufacturers have let them have it all their own way. Wenote the export to Pacific coast of Mexico of 3,68 bales of 1701b. each, which is rather a novel shipment." Mr. W. P. Wright, in his Circular on the Cotton Trade, says - " There is notming of interest to report about the market in this city. The sales and receipts are on the smallest scale, and no price can be quoted. The exports for the week have been-To Liverpool, 2,440 bales; Bremen 104; Antwerp, 100. Total, 2,644 bales. The whole cotton tlade of the country continues in a deranged stte, from the utter impossibility of negotiating exchange on Lon. don. In this city we are literally without stock, probably not over 1,000 bales being at this moment in warehouse. All marketable value is mere guesswork. In the South some small transactions are made daily, and prices are firmer, as will be noticed by the telegraphic advices. Factors have assumed a stronger attitude, since they are not for the present, nor soon likely to be, overburdened with stocks, owing to an evident determinsiion of the planters to keep their supplies at home rather than run the risk of having to accept what they consider the present ruinous prices. This is Clearly shown by comparing the receipts for the week ending last Saturday, advised by telegraph at New Orleans and Mobile, with the previousweek's receipts, as well as with the corresponding week's of last year. At every point in the South large orders on account of English sDinners are lying without action, it being impossible to p;as biDs of exchange even at a cost of 2d. sterling per lb. below the price wbioh spinners and others in England are, or were, very willln to pay. I see no chance for this unnatural posdtion of the traue to cease for some time at least. Gold is arriving here, it is true, from England, and being shipped to the South, but not in sufficient amount to move any even moderate quantity of the crop, and the last advioes from London clearly prove that we ahall not get gold frora Enland without having to pay pretty dearly for it. There is much distrust, also, as to what effect the increasing stringency in the money-market of England may have upon houses engaged In the American trade, and whether blls drawr against consignments of, or in the fulfilment of orders for, cotton, will be accepted, and if accepted paid at maturity. Altogether the whole trade is disorganized. and it must be 50 o 60 days before it can be resumed; the basis as to prices of such resumption must depend upon what Maa. chester is willing to pay, since it is now quite certain that her present absolute scarcity of cotton will by next spri-ng belturned into positive abundance, and that, too, without the shghtest aid from the Cotton Supplj Association. Very little importance of late seems to be attached to the question of crop. It is well perbaps, nob to lose sight of the subject altogether, although it is yet too soon to put forth an estl. mate. We have arrived so far into the season without the occurence of a frost, which has given rise to more favourable accounts from various sections in the South, where three weeks ago the complaints were most numerous, while from places where no complaints issued hwe now hear of promisng prospects and good crops. In view of all I bear on the sub. jetl conclude that some improvement in the prospect for the incoming crop has taken placa in the cotton-growing region generally during the last two weeks." Ilour was steady. The demand had been good for the home trade, and with some sales for export prices had been supported. Western Canal and State, good shipping, $4 70 to $5 25 per barrel. Ohio, Indiana, &c., $5 50c. to $6. Canada, $5 50 to $6.50. Southern, $5 50 to $6 25. Fancies and high extras, $6 50 to $8 and $8 175. The arrivals of Chicago spring wheat had been larger, aud of this description the price had declined 5c. per 601b., but the supply of all other qualities is small, and such command our full quotations of the 20th Inst., and in some instances an advance of 30. to 5c. per C9lb. for prime parcels. Southern white, 135c. to 14oc. per 601b. Western, 115c. to 135c. ; Canadian, 125c. to 140c. Western red and mixed, 100c. to 118c.; Southera red, 125c. to 132c. Indian corn had declined 5c. per 561b. for mixed. For molasses there was more inquiry. Sugar was quiet, but firm, and slightly higher; the European advices had not exercised much influence. The decline in sugar from the highest point of the season to the lowest was about 4c. per lb., of which -c. to ic. had been recovered. Provisions of all kinds were dull and lower. Crucde turpentine was steady. Iron was extremely quiet. Tobacco dulL Oils were inactive. Preights to England had improved-to Liverpool, cotton, Ad. to 5-32d. per lb.; flour, 2s. 6d. per barrel; grain, Iid. to 8d. per bushel; to London, flour, 2s. 6d. to 2s. 9d. per barrel; to Havre, cotton, ic. per lb. At New Orleans on the 27th lilt. cotton re. rnained unchanged. The rate for middling was lOc. The receipts, as compared with those of last year, fell short 105,500 bales; ditto at all Southern ports, 187,000 bales Sugar dull; fair, 6c. to 6Fc. Molasses, prime new, 17c. to 19c. Prime Rio coffee, 9jc. E:xchange-nothing doing. Iloney unchanged and sprospects gloomy. A meeting of cotton factors was held on the 26th, and a resolutionl was offered binding factors not to sell for less than lOC.; on;) mere being no concert of aton, the meetng broke up without effieting anything. A despatch from Toronto states that the liabilities of Ross, lithl,and Co. amounLt to $1,250, 000.

LORD MAYOR'S DAY. 'SWEARING IN OF THE NEW l.OT) rA AVrv The ancient ceremony of swearing In the new Lord Mayor took plae yeserday in the Court of Exchequer, before the rons of the Court. The learned barons present were the ILord Chief Baron, Mr. Baron Bramwell, Mr. Baron Watson, -and Mr. Baron Channell. Shortly before 2 o'clock the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, *1ir R. W. Carden, hLP., entered the court, preceded by the Mrious civio functionaries and accomoanied by the lato J,ord Mayor (Alderman Finals), Mr. Sheriff Lawrence, Mr. -ZSheriff Allen, the Recorder, and several aldermen, &o. The RECORDER, addressing the learned barons, sid he -lad the honour to present to their Lordships the Right Hon. ISIr Robert Walter Carden, M.P. for the city of Glocester, -who had been elected by the citizens of London to fil the bigh office of chief magistrate for the ensuing year. It would be unneessary for him in the presence of their Lordships to nay anything as to the nature of the duties which were to be discharged by him who was so honoured by the confidence -of his fellow citizens as to be elevated to the high position -of chief magistrate. Their Lordsblps well knew the high qualities necessary for such an offloe, and the citizens felt sure that nono of those qualities, high though thoy were, would be found wanting in him whom they had elected to the civio chair. Early in llEe Sir Robert Walter Carden had been destined for the military profession, and had held a commission in the army, but finding at the conclusion of the great European war that all chances of active servsice were at an end, his whole life since had beers passed as a citizen of London, and thus there was afforded to all to whom he 'was known an ample opportunity of forming an opinion of his zfitness for the high office to which he had been elected. His fellow-citizens had seen him for upwards of 40 years carrying on an extensive business in the city, and from the manner in whioh that business had been conducted he had won the confidence and esteem of all who had seen him. When it had become necessary for bim to devote a portion of his -time to public duties he had wiUingly borne the sacrifice which they had entailed, and had brought to their perform3nce that same vigour of mind and honesty of purpose by which he had achieved distinction in his private Bife. Having been called upon to fulfil the important duties of Sheriff of London and Mliddlesex, Sir BRobert Walter 'Carden had discharged thenn to the highest satisfaction of -bis fellow-oitizens, and he (the Recorder) was satisfied that mow when he was elected to a higher offlce, the manner in which he would fill it would afford him an additional claim --to publc confidence. He had also to present to their Lordships the late Lord Mayor-his labours over, his duties well discharged. When his predecessor in the office which be (the Recorder) had now the honour to fiU (hr. Stuart Wortley), whose services to the city must ever be rememlared with gratitude, and whose temporary retirement from publiclife all must deplore, had presented the late Lord Mayor to their Lordship8, he had expressed his confidence that when his year of office had expired he would have fulfilled -the hiFhest expectations of those who had intrusted It to bm. Those anticipations had been well fulfilled in the late Lord Mayor. He scarcely liked to refer to the maLnner In which the late Lord Mayor had fulfilled the ordinary duties of his office at a moment like this, when the public mind was concentrated on one great topic, and when it was asked of all publec men to whom the opportunity ws given what they bad done to avert or ameliorate the great 4calasmlty which had overtaken this country. The only effect which his private sufferings had had on the late Lord Mayor was to cause him to adopt measures for lightening the burden of those whose sufferings were the same as his own, but who were in less *prosperous circumstances. He had won for them Britlsb, sye and foreign sympathy, and when he looked back to his gear of offlce it would be his high privilege to feel that in some small degree he had afforded relief to sufiering which 0II knew to be unmerited, and which all must desire to mriti- ate. He had only further to remark that the citizens of Eondon relied vrith the fullest confidence on their Lordshlps preservlng to them their ancient rights, franchises, and privileges The lord C}iIEF B RON.-My Lord MIayor, I have to congratulate yoa on being raised to the highest honour which it is in the power of your fellow -itizens to confer, snd on your being raised to be the head of the most ancieut corporation of this kingdom, which Is an epitome in many parts of our ancient constitution, existing as it does as a monument of the free spirit of this country, and recording -those struggles for liberty in which she has been so often engaged. I am glad to see that this ceremonial is preserved -to keep us in mind of those struggles and of that constitu. -tion, to the maintenance of which the city of London has so often contributed. In modern times the duties oftheoffice wvhich you, my Lord Mayor, have been called upon to fill rre not so arduous as in former days, but on the present occasion, alluded to bythelearned Recorder, though muchhas done by your predecessor, much stiUl remains to be done. After the eloquent speech with which the learned Re. corder has introduced 7our Lordship to this Court we have to congratulate the citizens of London, after the loss they austained in their late Recorder, on his acceptance of that Important office, and I beleve I express the sentiments of my brethren when I say with what pleasure we to-day see .the learned Recorder, who is well known to us, and who represents in his profession that father whom we all love, esteem, and respect. My Lord Mayor, with the experlence qou have had of the commerce of London, with the proofs 'which your success has furaished of your vigour, your 'ualent for business, and your integty, I can well believe that you vill fulfil all the duties of your office in the manner anticipated by the learned Recorder. 'No doubt you will ever maintain the dignity and assert the 'privileges of the citizens of London. In the discharge of those duties you wiiU have an excellent example in the -rnanner in which they have been performed by your most ,worthy predecessor. He may have found how difficult were the duties imposed upon him, bathe has also learned 'now easy it is by zeal and devotion to the performance of -those duties to win the good opinion of all classes. Of your able performance of the same duties I entertain no doubt, not forgetting, my Lord Mayor, that hospitality for which the city of London isso famous. My Lord Mayor -I must congratulate you on retiring from your olficiai duties, and I must say that in ail my experience it does notoccur to me that there is any person who has fiUed that office more largely and more universaUy to the satisf action -of his fellow-citizens, and if I were to be called upon to point out why this is so, I would say it was from the cor-dial, the hearty, the devoted manner which the late Lord Mayor brought to the business of his office. It was obvious -his soul was in it-that his object was to do it with zeal, -cheeWfoiness. and cordiality. To no person, my Lord blayor, than your6elf can be more properly addressed the consolation that you retire after your year of office with the good -feeling of every person, and bear rwith you the blessings of thousands, if not of hundreds of thousands, who have been benefited by those subscriptions whlch you so nobly inaugurated. I trust you may long live to enjoy the good opinion of your fellow citizens, and that on retiring into prirate life you may long possess the cordial sym,pathies and hearty good wishes of every person who knows The usual formualities having been gone through, The learned RECORDER, on behalf of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, invited their Lordships to the banquet at Guildhall that evening. The Lord CHrFn BARON said that some of the members of the Court would do themselves the honour of accepting the invitation. The proceedings then terminated. THE BANQUET. The grand banquet given by the Lord Mayor and sherlSif to celhbrate their accession to office took place last night in the Gaildhall, which was decorated for the occasion with even mnoretbanordinary magnificence. The predominant characte; of the decorations was certainly warlike. In the centre of each *compartment between the clustered colunmns were large trophies, composed of armour, swords, guns, and pistols, -with emblazoned shields of various countries, bound ,together with laurel, and the columns themselves were fanked by muskets and halberds. On the embattled soreenssurrounding thehall were bayonetsand ptstols so disposed as to give the appearance of a chevaux le fd e, and -elieved by flags and Union Jacks. The eastern wvndow -had in its centre a large trophy composed of dags and -armour, beneath which, in letters of gold, were the words, " God save the Queen," and above It the Prince of Wales's Zeathers in spun glass. The western window had for its -decoration the beautiful glass star furnished by Copeland, and from every disposablepoint waved "the flags of all nations." Jets of gas foUowed the lines of the arches from one end of the hall to the other, and cast a brilliant light upon the gay throng of guests beneath. A-song those present were-the late Lord Mayor (Alder. man Finnts), the Lord Chancelor, Earl GranviUe, the Earl -of Harrowby, the Earl of Clirendon, Viscount Palmerston -the Marquis of Salisbury, Lord Paninure, the Chancelor or the Exchequer, Mr. Vernon Smith, MLP., Lord Chief Justice Campbell, Lord Justice Turner, Vice-Chancellor Stuart, Vice-ChanceUor Wood, Mr. Justlce Cresswell, Mr. Justice WiUiams, Mr. Baron Channel, the Solicitor. General, Sir F. Thesiger, MLP., Sir F. -ellyT M-P., Mr. XRobert Lowe, hLP., Sir J. Ramsden, M.P., Mr. John 'Walter, ALP., Baron Rothschild, M.P., Sir C. Codrington, 2,I.P., Sir W. Jolliffe, M.P., the Minister for the Hanse Towne, the Haytian and the Swedish Charg6s d'Affaires -Captain Mylno, Sir Edward Cust, the Marquis of Stafford, Sir B. Hawes, Mr. J. Wilson, M.P., Mr. R. W. Crawford, :3LP., Aiderman and Sheriff Lawrenco, Mr. Sheriff Allen, -'he Recorder of the City of London, Mr. Thomas Cham. aers, M.P., the Conmon-Serjeait, Mr. hieohi, Captain Shepherd, Captain Austin, Mr, C. Gilpin, MlP., Mr. J. Thwaites, Mr. Frederick Doulton, &o. Lord and Lady Palmerston on their arrival in the haUl were received with hearty cheering by the guests, After the lovIDg cap had passed round, The LORD MAYOR rose and said,-You will readily an. ticipate that the first toast which I shall have the honour to propose ia this hall will be no other than that of Her 3-sot Gracious Majesty the Queen. I believo that at no perlod did a feeling of greater loyalty and affection exist 'towards the Throne than at the present momaent; and ceriainly that feeling no where prevails more strongly than in the cdty of London. (Cheer.) I therefore beg to pro. Toee "The Health of Her Most Gracious Majesty the (ueen, and God ble her." Tbo toast was drank with enthusiaum, and was followed by the National Anthem. The LORD MAYOR.-The next toast which I have the bonour to propoe is that of the Plnce Consoxt; with whioh I shaU couple that of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the rest of the Royal famuily. I dare say many present are aware of the fact that this is the birthday of the young Prince, and therefore I hbaU call upon you to apply to his Royal Highness words familiar to aU of us in our home circles and to wish him "1many happy returns of the day." (Cheers.) The LoRD MAYOR again rose and said,-I believe tbat if I were to propose the next toast without a single word of preface the mere mention of '- the Army and Navy' would bo of itself suffioient to insure at your hands a moet enthusisstic reception. (Cheering.) Not many years ago we had been at peace for sO lo a penod that some of us were disposed to think but littleof the two services; some, indeed, opposed the existence of an army and navy at all, and many people fancied it impossible we should ever go to war again. (Hear.) At the prezent momont, however, I am sure there is not an English heart but beats gladly at the knowledge that we have an army and navy ready to face any danger and to meet every call which may be made upon them; there is not an Englishman but must feel proud of their recent brilliant ex.ploits, (Cheers.) In the Crimean war they nobly sustamned the honour of their country; and now in India, where few of us have not some friend or relation, and where events have occurred in which all must feel the most absorb. irg interest, our soldiers have displayed the most heroic courage and endurance. (Renewed cheering.) When we know that in India 500 Englishmen, taken by surprise as they were, and fighting under difficulties of climate which we shoald have thought almost insuperable-when, I say, we know that bands of Ilnglishmen in number not more than this have opposed, and sucessfUlly opposed, 5,000m utineers, we may well feel proud of our ga7ant soldiers, and feel certain that they wi7l ever carry the country through any difficulties of this kind under which we may labour. (Cheers.) And remember it is not as in former times. We have now an army and navy of volunteers. (Hear.) All compulsory service is abolished; every man who enters either the army or navy enters it of his own accord and I don't hesitate to say, judging from recent occurrenccs, that every man does his duty better than if he had been compelled to serve. (Hear.) As a proof that the citizens of London are fully sensible of the gallant deeds done by our soldiers, I would refer you, for the first time in this hall, to the monument of the late Duke of Wellington, which the citizens erected a3 a cost o: o,OOOI., and wvhich wil ever remain to testify oar rdmlr_.tion of the great commander both In the field and in the camp. (Hear, hear.) I vrill not detain you longer, but will give you "The Army and Navy," coupling with that toa t the names of Lord Paninurs and Captain Mylne. (Cheers.) Lord PA2iruiu'.-I am called upon to return thanks for the noble veterans of the army,-a duty which has always fallen hitherto upon some active member of that profession. Your Lordship has departed from the usual custom, but I bow to the authority of the Chief Magistrate of tho city, and I take upon myself the proud responsibility o returning thanks to this company for the army of England. I can, perhaps, speak of that army with more freedom than one who actually belongs to it; but it L unnecessary for me to remind you of the actions of British soldiers, wbether of those which are recorded in history or of those to which testimony has so recently been borne. (Cheers.) That army, I ain pleased to think, now attraots public attention, not alone for its exploits in the field-for they never were questioned-but on account of the anxiety which exists in this country to foster a force and to encourage a profession of which England may wel be proud, and from which upon all occasions it will obtain the most prompt and valuable assistance. On the occasion of +he Crimean war the army was ready in the field to defend the honour and the interests of England, and upon the late occasion to which the Lord Mfayor has so feelingly referred regiments which had only recently returned from a long period of service abroad proceeded with the greatest anxiety and avidity to India to zvenge the wrongs which had been done to their comrades in arms, and the atrocities which had been foully committed upon the wives and children of those comrades. (Cheers.) I am proud to thlnk that under the system of voluntary service to which the Lord Mayor has referred the ranks of the army, thinned as they were at home by the draughts which we have sent abroad, ane every week being rapidly recruited, and that the feeling which induces the men of England to enter those ranks is hourly on the increase. (Hear, hear.) I trust that we shall have placed at home, by the aid of that adjunct of the army which now forms a part of the army itself-namely, the enrolled and embodied militia of England-such a force as will give confidence to the subjects of our common Sovereign, nd wiUl show to the nations of the world that, how. ever and to whatever extent England has been called on in one part of her dominions, her army at home will imme. diatcly become efficient for her home service. (Cheers.) I beg leave to return you, in the name of the army of Eng. land, my best thanka for the honour you have done them. (Cheers.) Captain TYrLh in acknowledgng the toast on the part of the Royal Navy, said it would be satisfactory to all pre. sent to know that at no period of our history was there ever a more loyal devotion to the interests of the servlce than existed at the present moment among the members of his profession. In whatsver quarter of the world the Royal Navy misht be called upon to serve, whether afloat, on shore, or in the rivers of India, acting in concert with our gallant army, he felt sure that our officers and seamen would faithftlly discharge their duty and do their utmost to promote the honour of the country. (Cheers.) The LORD MAYOR said that, seated as they were In the heart of the city of London, it was usuaL on occasions like the present to propose, and he would accordingly ask them to drink, "Prosperity to the City of London and the Trade theDreof." The LORD MAYOR next proposed the health of the late Lord Mayor, Alderman Finnis, warmly eulogizing him for the manner in which he had discharged the duties of his office during thepast year. Alderman FayNis briefly acknowledged the toast. The health of the Lord ChanceUlor was then proposed and responded to. The LORD MAYOR.-The next toast is one which I am sure will be, as it always has been on these occasions, received with the greatest enthusiasm. Whatever the politics of the Government may be, we, met in this hail, in the centre of the city of London, know nothing of them; all we recognize Is, measures and men. (Hear, hear.) In proposing to you the health of the Prime Minister of this country, I vilL only say that I have sat opposite to him during a whole session, and have had ample opportunity of witnessing his constant and laborious devotion to the duties of his office. There never was, and projably aever will be, a Prime Minister of whom everybody approves h bat atll events we have in Lord Palmerston a Minister who conscientiondy and zealously performs the duties devoiving upon him. (Hear, hear.) It would be fulsome in a humble individual like myself to add a word in praise of the noble lord; but I will say that, as the first magistrate of the city of London, I feel proud to have him here as the guest of the citizens of London. (Cheers.) I feel the more satisfaction, too, because he is accompanied on this occasion by Lady Palvierston, and because r believe the citizens feel additional pride when the guests they invite are accompanied ,by their " betterhalves." (Langhter.)LordPalmertton hashadduring the time he has been in office to encounter great difficulties, but he has hitherto, and I believe will now, overcome them all; and I am confident that the people wirL never forget the services which he has rendered to them. (Cheers.) Stanch at his post, true to his country, let me give you, ladies and gentlemen, " Her Majesty's Mlinisters, " with the health of Lord and (though this may differ from the usual custom) of Lady Palmerston. (Loud cheers.) Lord PALBiERSTON, who on rising was received with loud cheers, said,-Mfy Lord Mayor, ladies, and gentlemen, I beg leave in my own name, on behalf of my colleagues, and in the name of my better half (a laugh), to return you my sincere thanks for the honour you have done me in proposing and drinking our healths. Your Lordship has alluded to the circumstance that you and I have looked at each other often from opposite sides of tho table of the Hose of Commons. I csn assure your Lordship-and I am sure you Will believe me when I say so-that it affords me infnitely more satisfaction to be sitting on the same side of your hospitable table than to fmd ourselves seated on opposite sides of that unfruitful table in another place. (Cheers, and a laugh.) My Lord,-I was In hopes that at our meeting to-day we might have had to announce the arrival of further intelllgence from that quarter of the globe on which all eyes are fixed, and to which the hearts of all mankind are directed. I was in hopes that we might have had-not a 0o nfirmation-but ampler details of that splendid exploit In arms by which the capital of Delhi has been conquered, and I trust that before many hours are over we shall receive intelligence which will cheer the hearts of every Engllshman, and will prove that the capture of that stronghold of the mutineer rebels has decided the fate of the oontest, and that what remains to bo achieved is merely a sequel to that which has already been accomplished. (Cheers.) It is Imposdble for any Englishman to allude to that which has been achieved in India-not by soldiers only, bht by civilians, by individuals, and by knots of men soattered over the whol e surface of a great empireowithout feeling prouder than ever of the nation; to which4 we have the happiness to belong. (Cheers.) There never was an instance in the history of the world of such splendid examples of bravery, of intrepidity, of resource, and self. relianoo ace omphshing such results as those which we have lately witnessed. The Government at home, on the other hand, may justly prido themselves on not having been un- equalto the magnitude of the occasion. We took the earliest opportunity of despatching to India a great army-an army which had not yet arrivod when those great viotories were accomplshed, but which, when it shall arrive, will render that whioh remains to be done comparatively easy of ao. complishment, and will, I cannot entertain the slightest doubt, reestablish the power and authority of England upon an unshakeable basis throughout the whole of our Indian empire. (Loud oheers.) My noble friend Lord Pan. mure has alluded to the spirit which has been displayed in this country, and I am proud to say, that although we have despatched from these shores the largest army that I believe ever at one time left them, we have now under arms In the united kingdom as many fighting men as we [had before the news of the mutiny reached us; and therefore, if any foreign nation ever dreamed in its vWisions that the exertions whioh we had been compelled to make inlndia had lessened our strength ati home, and that the time had arrived when a different bearing might be exhi. bited towards us from that which was safo in the moment of our strength, tbe manner in wbieh the spirit of the ountr7 ha,s p4rst 1prth, the pn>er in which our ianks have been filled, the manner in which our whole lorcs has been replenished, will teach the world that It would not be a safe game to play to attempt to take advantage of that whioh was erroneously imagned to be the moment of our vveakneu. (Loud and prolonged cheering.) It has been the fashion among the people of the continent to say that the English natiton is not a military nation. In one sense indeed-in their sense -that assertion may be said to be true. An Englishman is not so fond as the people of some other countries are of uniforms, of steel scabbards, and of iron heels (a laugh); but no nation can excel the English, either as officers or soldiers, in a knowledge of the duties of the military profession, and in the zeal and ability with which those dauties are perormed; and wherever desperate deeds are to be accomplished-wherever superior numbers are to be boldly encountered and triumphantly overcome-wherever privatlons are to be encountered-wrherever that which a soldier has to confront is individually or collectively to be faced, there, I will venture to say, there is no nation on the face of the globe which can surpass-I might, without too much nationai vanity say, I believe, that there is no nation which can equal-the people of the British islands. Cheers.) Bat, my Lord Mayor and gentlemen, wilIe we all admire the bravery, the constancy, and the intrepidity of our countrymen in India, we must not forget to do justice also to our countrywomen. (Loud cheers.) In the ordinary course of life the fanctions of wvoman are to cheer the days of adversity, to soothe the hours of suffering, and to give additional brillancy to the sunshine of pro. sperity; but our countarwomen in India have had occasion to show qualities of a higher and nobler kind, and when they have had either to sustain the perils of the siege, to endure the privations of a difficult escape, to forget their own sufferings in endeavouring to minister to the wants of others, the women of the uuited kingdoms have, wherever they have been found in India, displayed qualities of the noblest kind, such as never have been surpassed in the history of the world, (Hear, hear.) Hence. forth the bravest soldier may think it no disparage. ment to be told that his courage and his power of endurance are equal to those of an Englishwoman. (Renewed cheers.) But, my Lord Mayor, while we do justice to the great bulk of our countrymen in India we must not forget that person who, by his exalted position, stands at the head of our countrymen there. I mean the Governor-General, Lord Canning has shown throughout the greatest courage, the greatest ability, and the greatest resources; and, from the cordiality which exist between him as head of the civil service and Sir Colin Campbell as head of the military service, we may be sure that everything whtch the combined experience of both can accomplish wlll be effected for the advantage of the country. The task of Lord Camning will be indeed a difficult one. He will have to punish the gulty, he will have to spare the tnnocent, and he will have to reward the deserving. To punish the guilty adequately exceeds the power of any civilzed man; for the atrocities which have been committed are such as to be imagined and perpetrated only by demons sallying forth from the lowest depths of helL But punishmeot must be infileted (cheers), not only in a splrit of vengeance, but in a spirit of security, in order that the example of punished crime may deter from a ropetition of the offence, and in order to insure the safety of our countrymen and countrywomen in India for the future. (Cheers.) He will have to spare the innocent, and it is most gratifying to know that while the guilty may h3 counted by thousands the iniccent must be reckoned by millions. It is most gratifying to us and honourable to the people that the great bulk of the population have had no share in the enormities and crimes which have been cormmitted. They have experienced the blessings of British rule, and they have been enabled to compare It with the tyranny exercised over them by their native chiefs. They have had therefore no participation in theattemptswlhichhavobeenmadetooverthrowourdominion Most remarkable it is that the inhabitants of that part of our empire which has been mnost recently acquired (I mean the Punjab), who have had the most recent experience of the tyranny of their native rulers, have been most loyal on the present occasion and most attached to their new and benevolent masters. (Cheers.) Lord Canning will have also to reward the deserving; for many are they, both high and low, who have not only abstained from taking part In thls mutiny, but who have most kindly and generously sheltered fugitives, rescued others from the assaults of the mutineers, and have merited recompense at the hands of the British Government. I am convinced that If Lord Canning receives-as I am sure he will-that confidence on the part of Her Majesty's Government and of the people of this country without which it is impossiblefor a mau in his high position to discharge the duties which have devolved upon I him, it will be found, when this dreadful tragedy is over, that he has poperly discharged his duty, and that his conduct has not only boen governed by a sense of stern and un. flinchi ng justice, but also by that diecriminating generosity which is the peculiar characteristic of the British people. (Cheers.) I beg leave again to return you our best thanks for the honour you have done us in drinking our healtbs. (The noble lord resumed his seat amild prolonged cheering.) The toast of "Their Excellencies the Foreign Ministers' was acknowledged by the Minister for the Hanse Townrs. Lord PAz1MBSTON.-I take the liberty of proposing to you a toast which I am persuaded you v drink with the greatest satisfaction. It is a common saying that "as you begin so may you end." I apply that to my Lord Mayor, and as he has begun most blrantly his term of service on the present day, so I am suro you will join with me in wishing him health and strength during the re. mainder of his mayoralty, that he may fulfil his duties in the couree of the year with as much satisfaction to himself and to others as he has performed his hospitable duties this evening. (Cheers.) I beg topronose to you to drink "The Health of my Lord Mayor.' (Oheers.) The LoRD MAYOR.- With great sincerity I thank you for the honour you have done me. Nothing, believe me, shal be wanting on my part to fulfil all the anticipations which have been formed of my mayoralty. As I have commenecd it is my w3sh and intention to continue in the dls charge of the duties pertaining to may office. (Cheers.) Ris LORDs1iP rose and propsed " The E[ealth of Earl aud Countess Granville and the Hense of Peers," remarking upon the admirable manner in which the noble lord had acted as the representative of this country at the Czar's coronation and upon the hospltable reception which he (the Lord MIayor) had met with at Moscow at the A mbassador's table. Earl GnA?-TN ILLB, In returning thanks, said he thought all must have been struck by the great compliment paid to Lord Palmerstoni by a political opponent in the allusion by the Lord Mayor to what took place across the table of the House of Commons; but he was afraid that he could only attribute to feelings of kludness and courtesy the re. ference made by his Lordship to his (Lord Granvile's) table at Moscow. With respect to that mission, as soon as he was informed by his colleagues that they thought it would be for the public advantage that he should undertake what in itself was an agreeable and interestng duty he at erce acceuted It. And when at Moscow hethought that he should be best fulfilling the instructions of the Government and carrying out the wishes of the people of England if he tried to show that we were determined in peace not ts loseeightof thoseobjectswhicolwethoughtjustified war, and, on the other hand, to show that thefirst feelng of an Englishman, after the fight was over, particularly where the eneny had displayed great gallantry in the field, was to shake hands, and to prove that he had no rancour left in his heart. It had been his fate a few days ago to retaua thanks In the city for the House of Lords, and some circumstances connected with certain members of that asemmbly had led him to be unmerciflly, although he trusted not unjustly, prolix. He would not, however, try to cure the evl to-night by acting on the homceopathic principle of similia similibus curantur. (Laughter.) He would only say that he believed the HouEe of Lords, in common with every class of nglilshmen, when a really national emergency arose, would unite as one man in defence of the interests and honour of the country. (Cheers.) The Lord Mayor had been pleased to couple with bis health that of Lady Granville, and he accepted gratefully the compliment which his lordship had pal7d her for the manner in which she had performed the duties of hospitality at Moscow. He begged to assure them that their divorce to-night was only temporary, and that the absence of Lady Granville, occasioned as it was by impaired health, was a souree of great regret to her and to him. (Hear, hear.) The other toasts were-"Her Majesty's Judges," acknowledged by Lord Campbell; "the House of Commons," for which Sir F. Thesiger was called upon to return thanks; " the Sheriffs of London and Miadlesex ," "the Lady Mayoress," proposed by Earl GranviUe; "the SolicitorGeneral and the Bar of England;," " Sir James Duke and the City Members;" "the Aldermen and the Recorder." The ladies had retired from the dinner table some time before the last toast was given, and occupled themselves in inspecting the sculpture and very tasteful decorations of the various rooms leading from the Guildhall In the centre of the Loggia leading to the Exchequer Court (converted into a banqueting-room for the occasion) were placed two circular basal relievi shields seven feet in diameter, designed and executed by Mr. J. G. Lough. The one caUed the shield of Milton is illastrativt of Satan's call upon his followers to "Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen." The other,or the Shakspeare shield, represents Shakspeare in the centre, sleeping, watched by two aerial genii of dreams, and surrounded by the characters of his creation. In other parts of the ball were statues of " The Spirit," from Comus, by lr. Lough; "ArTel," from Shakspeare's Tempest, by Mr. Hancock; " Chastity," by Mr. Durham; and a group of boys, " The Firbt Thorn," by Mr. M'Dowal In the area on the western side of the Aldermen's Court-room was a scenic representation composed from Gray's Pindaric Ode of "The Welsh Bard," containing a fine statue of the bard. by Mr. Theed.

D)ISASrous Fm.-About 10 minutes pat 2 o'clock on Sunday morning a fire was discovered raging in the bedrooms of the Victoria Hotel, Fleetwood, the pro. party of a Mr. Dodd. An alarm was of course instantly raised, and the Fleetwood 5engine got to work; a messenger was also despatched to Rossall-hall college for the engine belonging to that Institution; but both these engines were very inefficient, and a message was sent to Preston for assistance. Mr. Marriott, the superintendent of the fire brgace in that town, received the message a few minutes past 6 o'clook, at the brigade station, with an intimation also that the property immediately adjoining the Victoria Hotel was m imminent danget. He rang the alarm bell, and, a body of 12 firemen belng asmemble&, he Erepared an engine, ran it down to the railway station all haste, and he and his men left Preston with the engine and appurtenances on a truck at 20 minutes past 6, arriving in Pleetwood at 10 minutes to 7 o'clock. The Victoria Hotel was at this time com. letely gutted, and the fire wasstill raging amongthed6bris. he roofs and side timbers of the adjoining buildings in Dock-street were also in flames. Mr. Mariott immediately got his engine into play, but, in consequence of the tlde being now out, and not having a sufficient length of hose to reach from Dock-street to the water, he was oblfged to have a supply of that element conveyed to a tub placed midway between Morecambe Bay and the scene of the fire. By this means the flames were arrested in thoir course, and very little damage was sustained by the property adjoining the rains of the Victoria Hotel after the arrival of the engine from Preston. The men who accompanied it Continned topldy upon the smouldering ruins of the Victoria Iotel ano the contiguou.s houses until nearly 9 o'clock, 'When they left the flames to be finally extinrgished and the ruins guarded against another ont- reak by Ileetwood and Rossall engines. Nothing but a mere sheU of the Victoria Hotel Is left standing. The servants and the whole household of Mr. Dodd narrowly escaped a frightful death, for the flames had acquired an uncontrollable strength before the fire was even discovered. Nothing wihatever is known of its origin. The premises were left apparently safe at 10 minutes past i o'clock, and the cause of the disaster is at present a mystery. Immediately on the discovery of the fire the tenants of the adjoining houses were aroused from sleep, and a great deal of t eir property was hastily removed into the street, where it remained until the flames were subdued. Mr. Dodd had 8001. in gold in a drawer of an escritoire upstairs. A portion of this was found fused among the ruins on Sunday morning, in several lumps, by Mr. Marriott, in a spot underneath the room where the escritoire had stood. There were also in the same drawer 300l. in private bank checks, whicb, of course, were destroyed. The dama-e altogether accruing from this casnalty is very considerable, but the exact amount cannot yet be stated. Mr. Dodd is fally in. sured.-Manchester Guardrin.

7 TBE Ai7BDBS OF A POETCR-COYMBLE IN HE BTPOFDSHI?aE. TEV'EN'AGE, Nov. 9. The inquest on the body of Jo8hn Starkins, of the henrfordshlre county constabulary, wh was found barbarously n.urdered in a pond, near Stvevnage, a few days ago, was r(ssmed to-day att the xational Schoel-room ixn that town bdfore Mr. C. Tune6s, coroner. The case up to the present time is one of entirely circr stantial evidence as against the inan apprehended. Tbe crime has caused the deepest feeling of horror in the neigh. beurhood. It appeared on examination of the body that such had been the atrength with which the knife was used that it had actually penetrated to the vertebr. at the back of the neck, and tbe head was nearly dropping off. Captain Robinson, the chief constable, attended to watch the proceedings. The first witness examined was Mir. Dunn, surgeon, wko made the post-mo-e,n examination. fie stated that he found on inspection of the body that the scalp had been semoved, the head sawn off, and the brains examined by another professional man. On the day of the inquest he bsd * conumUnication with Captain Robinson, who desired him to make aa immediate examination, as it was important that it should be made at once. Witness said that he could not do it that evening, but was prepared to do it early next morning. Findingthatthe body had been partially examined, he comnunicated with the coroner, who directed him to proceed with it. On the following Thursday, when he presented himself to make the examination as disected, he was refused admission to the room by thepolice until ir. Smith, the other practitioner who had been called in, arrived, when they proceeded to make the examination together. The deceased was 5 feet 9 inches high, about 25 years of age, and of a robust constitution. The body appeared to have been soaking a day or two in water, the hands and feet in particular being quito sodden. There was a piece of skin knocked off the joiut of the little finger, apparently by a blow. There was also a wound on the lips, as if they had been torn by the point of a ktdfe. BBlow -the ehin was a wound, about two inches long, and an oblique cut on the left side of the neck. The principal wound was one in the throat, about six inches long, extendlng from one angle of the jaw to the other. -The wound had irregular edges, and appeared to have been done with three distinct cuts of a knife. The commencement of the wound was on the right sid. The knife appeared to have been thrust two inhes deep into the neck and then violently drawn across the throat. Both the interasl and external carotid arteries -.ere divided, as well as each of the jugular veins. The knife appeared to have cut close down to the spine; consequently the head was almost severed from the body. On the left side the jugular veins were also didided. In consequence of the length of time that life had been extinct the rigor mortis had nearly disappeared. The carotid artery on the left side-was not divided, the consequence of which was that the head being lower than the body some blood might have run into the head and caused the general extravasation visible In the skulL It did not appear to have resulted from strangulation. No doubt, in case of strangulation the brain would be greatly cougested, but he was of opinion that in consequence of the large vessels being cut the blood would haverun out of the body very soon, and the extravasation would disappear. There was no doubt that the large wound on the throat must have caused almost t. mediate death. Probably the man was dead in less than a minute after that wound was made. It appeared to have been caused by a pointed instrament, but not a very sharp one, though suffioiently sharp, with the exertion of some strength, to have caused the cut. His i3ason for suppo that it was not a very sharp knife was because it appeare to have pushod aside somne of the cartilage, which a sha one wonld have cut through. There was no doubt inTia mind that the wound could not have been inflicted by the deceased. Witness saw the body soon after ib was taken out of the water, before it was undressed. The coUar was cut as if by a pointed knife, such as was sometimes used by labourera. The coat and also the stock of the deceased wvere here produoed and showrn to the jury, and the witness said that, from the mutilated condition of the coat collar, and the fact of the stock being bent down, it appeared to him that some rson had grasped the deceased by the collar, forced him oen, and 'hen cut his throat. There were aiso no traces of blood from the place where the marks of a struggle were vsible to the pond in which the body was foundwhereas, if it were possible to suppose that the man crawled to the pond, there must havo been a distinct track of blood. The wound appeared to have been inado when the man had been brought to the ground by another leaning over him or while standing in front of him. By the Jury.-The wound was much deeper on the right side of the throat, and the cut on the coat seemed rather to have been made after the knife came out of the throat. By the Coroner.-The back of the coat appeared to have been drenched with blood, as if the wound had been made eitber when the man was standing, and t0at he had fallen on his back, or that the wound had been made when he was lying on the groand. Witness thought that from such an inctsin as aupeared to have been made a great quantity of blood would have spurted on the person who mflicted injury. When veins of that description were cut the blood Jetted out with considerable force. The elasticity of the stock would probably have prevented a good deal of the blood from covering any person near, because after the person had let go his hold the stock would go back again to its original positlon. When the body was found the stock completely covered and almost concealed the wound. If blood jetted out from the neck of one man on to the body of another it would depend upon the distance whether the blood would be in spots or patches upon the clothes of the otber. Witness thought that the hands and wrists of the murderer must have been covered with blood, especially if onehaud grasped the stock of the man. The Coroner then addressing the jury, said that it was quite clear that the deceased had met his death by foul means, and not by his own act; therefore it now became their duty to investlgate the matter further. Mr. Chalkley, one of the jury, 2enurred to this course of proceeding, stating that he thought all they had to do was to say whether the man had committed suioide or had been murdered. The Coroner rensinded the jurymen that they were bound to inquire by what means the deceased came to his death. Mr. Chalkiey appeared Inclined to dispate this ruling, and was about to raise a discussion on the question, wvhen The Coroner said that, as 14 jurymen had been sworn, he might retire if he thought fit. Mr. Challdoy accordingly adopted that alternative, and retired from the room. Thomas Cooper, a flydriver, living at Stevenage, stated that last Friday evening week he took a lady from the Stevenae station to Chapel Bury, between 5 and 6 ou'cock. A s he passed Norton-green-lane ho saw a policeman standing on the railway-bridge, looking about. AKlthough he did not like to swear to the fact, he wfas pretty well sure that it was Starkinss Elizabeth Rowe, the Inhabitant of a cottage situated in a field a short distance from the pond in which the body was found, stated that she saw a person auswering the description of the policeman pass down alone at the bottom of the field in which her cottage was situated, and go on in the direction of the field called Cooper's Braches, in which is the pond in questlon. She knew a man called Jeremiah Carpenter, wvho had been apperehended on the charge of murder, but did not see him pass her house that eveniuon his retunu from work, though she remained outside the door til ff o'clock. Mr. Edward Horn, the occupier of a farm in the neighbonrhood of Stevenage, called Norton-green Farm, deposed that he employed Jeremlah Carpenter, the accused person. Witness was present at the time the body was found last Monday, and in the afternoon of that day, on maklng an inspeotion of the field, he found some wheat on the ground in a place where there seemed to have been a scuffle. The wheat was of the same description of wheat that he had been sowing, anld was mixed with some barley. IHe finished sowing the day before the murder. It was a very unusual thmg for barley to be mixed with wheat. To the best of his belief the vwheat belonged to him, and he supposed from that circumstance that it had been stolen from him. Some wheat which had been found inn neighbouring wood was here produced, and compared with the wheat picked up at the place at which the struggle occurred, and with wheat taken from Mr. Horn's barn. This wheat was closel examined by the jury, most of whom were farmers, aul who declared all the samples posqessed a general resemblance. Examination resumed.-The sample taken from the wood did not seem to be exactly the same in his opinion as the other. Carpenter was employed by witness on Friday week in a.field on Norton-green Farm, and Cooper's Braches would be in a direct line to Carpenter's cottage from that spo' Carpenter's cottage was in the high road near Stevenage, a little under a mile from the field in which he was at work. lt would take him about 20 minutes to walk to the field in which he worked. From the place at which the marks of the struggle were visible to Carpenter's house was about 150 yards, and it might take him two minutes to walk there. Carpenter left work at half-past 5 o'clock. On Thursday, the 29th of October, Carpenter was assisting in sowing the red wrheat. He was a very powerful man. William Red examined.-I work for Mr. Horn, and am foreman. On Tharsday, the 29th of October, I was at work sowing wheat. Carpenter was employed on that morning to assist in sowing, and in the afternoon, at 3 o'clock, we sent him to the farm to fetch some wheat, as we thought we should not have enough. He brought the wheat and remained in the field til 4 o'clock, when we finished tho field. I then went to the farm with. Sheppard), and Carpenter went to the farm a different way. When I got to the farm I found Carpenter there. He remained until half-past 5, and then we.t aWaJ with some other men named Shppard, Flint, and Spicer.

I told him to go iato the barn, but he was unable to work from his 3 Ihmeness, and I saw him going home on that morning about. half-pat 7 ; he was then walking very lame. On the following day I calld at Carpenter's house to inquire hssr he was, and he told me that the police had been to sv6 which. way he had come the previous night home, and ho rm&id " I came aoross the wood and by the cottages."

He usually wore hs smock frock tied round his shoulders by the sleeves, but he could not tell whether it was tied in that nmanner on that particular day. It was about 20 minutes after he casue up the garden before Carpenter sent for his aseishtance. When he went there and took off the block he fell round on his back. Witness on taking him into the house and taking off his boots said the leg wAs very much rwollen, and advised him to send for a doctor.

Aa cRla~ SYMrPATHY WITH MThGLAD.-We are in the midst of a terrible convulsion. Our business nterests are threatened with utter ruin, and our workingclasses already feel the pressure of want. The darkness thickens, and no eye can see the end of the acoumulating trouble. But, gloomy as wo find the position of our affairs, they aro sunny and cheerful compared with those of our mother land. Here we already know the worst of the calanity that has come upon the country. There the clonds are still gathering and they mnst expect two storms to burst upon them at once -each sufficient to try most severely the fortitude of any nation, and calculated to crush many beyond recovery. The winds from the East, where, not many months ago, iEngland commandedthehorme of a vast and wealthy empire, come laden with the shrieks and groans of her slaughtered sons and outraged daughters, and even above these sounds of expiring misery are heard the imploring acoents of little bands of heroes who are fighting aganst tremendous odds of ferocious mutineers, and bravely upho!ding their standard, though almost exhausted i the struggle. The little island Is being drained of every band that can bo spared from the factory or the field. There is sca,cely a family in the realm which has not contributed an arm for the fearful battle, and scarcely a firesde that does not mies a familar face now absent in that tropic land of blood and horror, or hurrying to the point where England needs most desperate strokes. The straia upon the energies of our ancestral people Is mighty ; yet they bear it with an iron determination peculiar to a race born to conquer and command. They not only display no shrinking from the conflict, but dare to talk of their ulti- -ate tnumph as certain, and plan the punishment of those who have roused the lion's vengefal ire. Even while the struggle with the mutineers Is most disastrous in its aspect this brave nation prosecutes a war against the miliWons of Chioa, and maintains the su remacy of its flag ini every portion of tho globe. Their morning drumbeat does not cease to follow the sun around the earth. Bat it is plain that this test of British courage a3d strength is one of the severest ever yet applied, and it Is even confessed that at the present hour their power in the East trembles upon the verge of annihiilation-that Asia seems slowly slipping from their grasp. Just about the time that the news of further Indn disasters will reach England a steamer will arrive at Liverpool from New York burdened with intell;gence that will send a fearful thrill through the heart of the kingdom. This people, -who already have two great wars upon their hands, will learn that the financial panic in this country has proved more thoroughly destructive than they had any reason to anticipate; that the debts due them in the United States cannot be paid, and,that, instead of sending them gold, we are looking to them for a supply to relieve our distress. Each succeeding steamaer will conv,y to them additional news of disaster, and, it Is almost needless to say, will set iu motion additional trains of ruin and misery among them. The great manufacturing towns, crowded with operatives, will be swept as with the breath of pestilence, and all the horrors of extreme poverty we may behold around us will be as nothing compared with what will be experienced in those industrial cities where labourers are never blessed with extra wages, and where there are no resources such as we find in the great natural wealth of our country to fall back upon to recuperate. A kingdom which even in the most ro rous times has its miOions of paupers must at a pe ofd ldtress following a financial convulsion exhibit such a mass of misery as will appal the heart, sicken the soul, and dim the eye of humanity, Not only will this suffering of the great working population make the strongest appeals to the charity of those who are untouched by the storm, but it will probably lead to tumult and violence, threatening the very existence of the Government. The Vnglish are a conservative people, and disposed to be loyal and devoted to the powers that be. But the desperation of the poor drives them to acts of unthinking indiscriminate fury, and they care not how they direct their rage to crush and destroy. Here is the home trouble which now combines with the bloody struggle in the East to darkon the sky of Britain ag it has seldom b^en darkened before. Let us trust that her energy and fortitude are sufficlent to bear her through the double tempest. Again, we say, while we are lamenting over our own gloomy situation, let us not forget the straits In which our mother land is placed, and let us learn from her a lesson of patience and resolution which will render -s. truly a heroic people.-Phiatoddphia Esingrournat.

FOREIOK IN'TFLLIGFBNOE. - FRANCE. (FRoM OUR OWN CORUWPON;P2Vr-1 [A portion of the following appeared i our eoWAd ed& Uoln uf vesta1dav:-I - PARIS, SuSNDAY, NOV. 8, 6 P.r. I gave an account some months ago of the commotion excited among the congregations of the United Catholics in the East in consequence of an attempt made by the Papal delegate to force upon them the Gregorian oalendar instead of the one used by them from time immemorial. The Eastera Ohritans cliDg to their old hagiology With tenacity; it contains far more festivals and saints than the Roman calendar, and many of them have already gone over to the schismatic Church rather thm submit to the Gregorian system. By reason of the countenance given to the delegate by the French Consul in effecting this innovation the French Government was appealed to, but, though promises were made that this functionary should be instructed not to Interfere in what did not concern him, nothing has been as yet done, and the persistence in reforming the liturgy continues to give rise to unpleasant incidents. The United Catholics complain that the occult practices of the Roman Propaganda are supported by the influence of the French Consuls and render null and void the more tolerant and judicious measures of the OttomanPorte. The Grand Vizier, having beeninforaed of the coercion exercised towards the United Catholics who resisted the Introduction of the Roman calendar, which changes all their customs and sacred rites, addresed to his Highness the Viceroy of Egypt the following letter:- " A petition has been received by me from the represent. atives of the Greek Catholio nation, by which I learn that the chiefs of the religion of that nation practisa constraint on their co-religlonists with respecttothosub. stitution of the calendar. That substitution, they affirm, Is contrary to the principles and ancient usages of their fath, and those who have refused to adopt it have been prevented from entering thelr churchef, and for many months have beer debarred from the practice of their customs and their rules. They now demand the free exer. cise of these usages, as heretofore, and the cessation of the acts of violence exercised against them. Now, oonsidering that every individual has a right to follow the rules and practices of the religious faith whloh he professes, in full and entire liberty, without any one having the power to Interfere with him in any way, the coerdon practised towarda thousands of our fellow-subjects to enforce the adoption of a calendar 'which Is not regarded as a rellgous dogma, the prejudice suffered by them, the vexatious occasioned to them, especially in their exclusion from their places of wor. ship, and their privation for so long a period of theiz religions rites, appear to me to be highly Injudicious and un. becoming. Wherefore It has been deemed urgent by your sincere friend :to addres you the present letter, In order that you lose no time in informing the vicar of the Patriarch resding In your province that he must nctk exercise violence agalnst the natlon above-mentioned, nor do theta injury; and that he must not any longer prevent them from fcliowr ing their zules and customs as hitherto." After so moderate and rational a communlcation the Viceroy could uot well refuse to give satisfaction to the population, justly alarmed and exasperated at the persecution to which they were exposed. He promised his intervention with the French Consul, and sent him a copy of the Grand Vizier's letter. The Consul replied that he shouldgive his answer In three days. Before the three days had elapsd the Viceroy swt out on ajourney, and matters still remain in the same state. The writer of a letter from Alexandria says "H ow can such conduct be palliated or explained except by supposing thaS there is a preconceived deter. mination on the part of the French Consuls In tho East to promote the usurpation of the Court of Rome, without pay. Dg any regard to the wishes of their own Government, who are too enlghtened to aUow their agents to do viloenoe to the liborty of conscience? We are persauaded that when they are fully Informed on tho subject they will disapprove the conduct of these agents, and send them instractions to that effect. These individuals ought not to be permitted to Sacrifice French influence to their personal vlews, or to the uWust exigencles of the Roman Propaganda. I say tho Rman Propaganda, for It is difficult for us to believe that the Pope is a party to these innovations, which he may be sure are pregnant with danger to the Catholie faith In these parts. We cannot admit that the Pope is capablo of falsfying his own words. In his encyclical epistle, ' In apremnri Prti,' addressed to the Orlentals in 1848, he says-' We will maintain completely intat your Catholic Liturgies, which we sincerely respect, thotgh they differ from the Liturgy of tho Latlu Church.' We might also appeal to the bull of Pope Benedict XIV., which Is not less explicit. Bat where is tho uQS of doing so ? The intrigues of subordinate agents, at leat of French agents, who from personal views deceive their Governments, are they not manifest to every one? We trust that the Pope will not allow himself to be imposed upon; and we feel confident thatthe Emperor of the French will take our case into serious consideration; and that he l persuaded that the profound respect of whloh he is the object in the East will not be diminished through Jesultical Intrigues which are equally base, unjust, and impolitio. We are, therefore, full of hope that the protection of the Emperor will be as real as the confidence and devotlon we feel towards him." In my notice of the report (diciamen) of M. Cortina and his two brother advocates, purporting to be a defence of Queen Christina against, the.repo.-t of the Parliamentary CommisIon appointed by the Constituent Cortes to inquire into the charges against that lady, I omitted to mention one circumstance. In the first page of the report appears an advertisement forbidding the partial reproduction of It in any of the journals, and the authors declare their intention to take legal proceedings against such as shall give only extracts from it. They muat give it entire or not at all. Now, oonsidering that the report contains nearly 155 pages of rather closely-printed type, and that there Is, as in all Spanish documents, the average amount of complimentary and useless matter, the condition of giving all or nothing is rather hard on the comparatively diminutive journals of Madrld. Be this as it may, the Epoca of the 3d, in which appeared a few lines relative to the allegation of the Queen Mother having been the adviser of the reforms of the Constitution contemplated by the Bravo Murillo Cabinet, is to be prosecuted by M Cortina and his confrores. A private letter from Madrid of the 4th inst. says:- "Marshal Narvaez is much amnoyed at the Idea of the return of Queen Christina to Spain, with whom, it appears, he is for the twentieth time on very bd terms. He says that she should be superior to political parties, and that her I converslon to Liberalism' is likely to be of the grteBt 1njury to the country. He had authorizd the Duke de Rivas, Spanish Ambassador In Pari, to inform her that she could return to 3pain whenaver she thought proper, but that he could not approve any of i&I and solemn entry, which, by the way, is that which the present Cabinet is diposed to give her. Hig motive was his auxiety not to offend the King-Consort, 'who is partl cularly hostile to Maxla Chrisina, and by whom, and by whose CamariUa, Narvaez is zealously upheld. He als declares that both he and Pidal, when members of the Government, were for a Whole month constantly entreati3g the Queen to reply to the letter which she had reoeived from her msother, and that the Government couder ha been delayed three days beyond the usual time in order that Her MaJesty sbould do so. The inference tobo drawn from this is, that the return to Madd of Maria Chrlltina not only is not desired by her daughter, but that even the latter would be likely to oppose it. I repeat, however, that it is not Maria Chrlstina who so anxiously wishes to return, bub rather her husband, the Duke de IRares, I apprehend, then, that her return Is not so near at hand as you may suppoae. The Queen.Mothar la ex. tremely acute. She is well acquainted with affair, sad, what is more, where Spain is concerned, she is well ac. quainted with the characters mad tempers of the men who direot them. I think I may also assure you that theCabinvi will do nothing withoat the Cortes. But will it last till then? That is the question. With such intIgues as are constantly on foot in the Palace, as well as those of the Mo. derado fraction, It is daioult to affim anythinn r specting this country. The King and his CAmArilla do not cease imploring the Queen to restore Naraez to powrer, and the present Cabinet Is ever on the watch to counterc that influence. They are about to appoint as first Aldede, Camp to the King General Amero (Joaquin), brother of the Prime Minister. The General wishes to have the gnpreme direction of the cavary, an2d he wishee, at the same time, to be attached to the person of the Kin& in order to resat the sation of his (,UWallM, pad to watch their proceedings. Narvaes, It mut. bo admitted, displayas much ability towards the alumfst of power, but he does not knor so wel how to keep It. The rewon is, that when out of croe he pro. mises everything to those who aid him, butacmopnp nothing when In the Govermnent; and, indeed, it Iimposblo for him to stisf every one to whom ob as givoi plcdges, or to fulfil even the hundredth part of his engage, ments. " ML Pidal wll go to Rome to take the post of Ambnassador, left vacant by hisbrother-ia-law ,IX on. The post is a lucrative one. " You may not have forgotten the scandalous scene which occurred last year, In presence of the wife of General AIeson, between Narvaez and Gnel y Rente, when the latter was violently assaulted by the former. A duel wa3 expeoted to ensue, but it was prevented by Narvaez having become, a day or two after, Prime Minister, when his adversary was obliged to quit Spain. Guel y Rentc is, M you are aware, married to the Infants Josepha, and Is consequently brother-in.law to the King Consort. He resided in Paris for some time, but he has just returned to Madrid; and, as Narvez is now merely a private individual, Guel y Rents charged his friend General Prim with a hostile measage to Narvaez. The duel he proposes is one that mut be mortal to one or other of the combatants. We do not yet know whotber Narvaz will accept the challenge. In the meantime the wretched Nocedal, so arrogant when Minister, dares not show himself in the streets. He keeps in conoealment4 at Toledo, with a few of his partisans who formerly belonged to his secret police. The public irritation agains himis great." The report of M. Cortina already alluded to states that Queen Chrlatinas, intead of advising ow supporting, had strenuously opposed the reform of the Constitution intended by the Bravo M:uzilt, Cabinet. The aecouchement of the Queen is, it appears, expected from day to day, &a the officers in command of the batteries that are to fire the customary salutes have been ordered not to quit their quarters, and the men charged with hoisting the flags are also watching at their posts. Telegraphic despatches were received at Madrid o;s the 4th from Lisbon. They announce the decline of the pestilence, but add that the Marquis de SotoAller, an'attache of the Spanish Embassy ill that city, bad fallen a victimafter a few hours' illness. News from the provinces announced that rain was faling in abundance, and that the country throughout Spain presented a very favourable appearance. In spite of the denial given to the statement that an arrangement existed between Prusia and Austria on the question of the Danubian Principalities, it is again affirmed in quarterssuppoed to be wet informed that it actually exists; and that It not only exista between these Governmenta, but that it is more than probable the English Government is a consenting party, and that, in fact, the three Powers have adhered to a mixed project of the usme kdnd as that attributed to Lord Clarendon-namely, an administrative instead of a political union. A tele- Bphie menage from Conatantinople states that chid Pasba gave on the 31st ult. a grand dinner, which wra attended by all the members of the Diplomatic Body with the exception of Mb de Thouvenel, the French Amtbassador, who had not been invted. The rapture of relations includes,. it appears, the comnnisriat department. The new French Minister at lAthens, M. de Mon. thenat, was received on th.e 29th ult. In private audience by Eing Otho, when he presented his credentials. Ile delivered the usual address,. and his HIellenlo Majesty ex:pressed inl reply his warmest sympathy towards France and the Government of the Emperor. x. de Monthenat was then introduced to the Queen, who received himin the most flattering manner. ft was observed at Athens that, since the coolness betwveen France and the Porte, the feeling of the Greek GEovernment has become particularly friendly and warm. Accounts From Bruels, dated yesterday, 4p.m., mhention that the propositions of M. RogIer were not considered acceptable by the ing. M. Decker was uemmoned to the Palace, and had a long inter view with His Majesity. In the evening theiMrniteia met in counciL. It was believed that the retiring Ministers would open the ChaM. bers on Tuesday in order to alloc the ting time for deliberation. Orders have been given to prepare tho Palace of St. Cloud for the reception of the Emperor and Empress on the 17th. It is therefore pro. bable that the Compogne festivities ofill close on the 1thh or 20the Te papers have been very sparing in their notices of these fesivities. AUSTRIA (ro onowononsrNxN. VIENNA, Nov. 5. Three or four weeks ago you learned from me that someof the members of the Catholic unonshadf hen holding conventicle at Salburg spoken unfavourably of the character and measures of the members of the Imperial Cabinet. The correctness of my statement is now denied by the Jesuits, but you may be sure that you wrere not misinformned. Indeed, there is reason to believe that the ardinal Archbilshop of Vienna, the leader of thpe ltramontane party, has expressed his disapproval of several things which were said and done at Saizburg. The names of some of the persons who displayed so little Chrlstian charity towards His Majesty's Ministers are known, butitdoes not appear to be a part of my dutyhas your aorrespondent to make publkc mention of them. The proprietors of some of the Vienna mapers believe that they shall be able to seep their heads above water in spite of the heavy tax whlch has just been imposed on them, but, in ay opinion, the Austrian press has received a fatal blow. No mention is now made in the public papers of the ordinanca relative to the stamp, as their responsible Managers are aware that they wtould get luto difficulties if they should venture to censure it. The advices whEich reach us from Hungary are by no means satisfactory. The plentiful harvest is no boon to the owners of the soil, as they cannot dispose of their corn at prices which would enable thenm to live and pay their taxes. There is little hope that Hungary will ever be able to compete successfully with Moldavla and Wallachia in foreign markets, as the price of labour iE much higher in the Austrian Crown Land thanr it is in the Princpalities. Some years ago Government was extremtely desirous to induce German colonists to settle inHtungary, which isathinly populated country, but the Roman Catholic Church objects to the introduction of foreign Protestants inte the Auotrian empire. dIurig the harvest coma on labourers demanded and obtained three or four shilling a-day, and some of the great landed proprietors were compelled to give the peasants onehalf of their crops of hay as an equivalent for their services in he ping them to get In the other half. As a ruleithe fred peasants are either too proud or too idle to serve their other masters. It has often been remarked in my correspondence that the Concordat is the bane of Austria, and the present state of Hungary is a proof that my assertion is wrellfounded. The convention with the Papal Chair has not only caused disunionl between the Catholics and Protestants who formerly inved amicaubly together, but it has deprived he empire of the services o many tho and of industrious and intligent Germans who would have been well content to erigrateto eungary if an adequate compensation for the expenses of their journey had been given them in lind. As has been said, the Roman Oatholic hierarchy objects to the introduction of a newr Proo testant leaven into Hungary, and it is not likely that German Protestants would feel inclined to aie up their residence in a country in which their church In regarded with an unfriendly eye. Neither pro. erty nor life is secure in many part of Hungary, and wonderful tales are told of the audacity, or rather the impudence, of the robbers Things are kept as quiet here as possible, but many men of business are in great embarrassment. The Discount Bank has lo1t a considerable sum of money during the present commercial cris, btt it is a very well managed establishment, and will hardly fail to pay a good dividend. According to the Tszet Zeih&W, the liabilties of the house of Balablo amount to 8,979,180 lire, and its assets to 8,480,570 lire.

NOVxMBaR 6.1 The news that the Bank of England has raised its ?ate of disount to 9 per cent. produces a moabt. u, plesant impresion on the Vienna financers, apd lnduces them to talk most unlearnedly on natlo4sa economy. These gentlemen, who do not seon to understand that gold is a ware which must vTa in prie In proportion to the demand for it, not oniy denounce the Directors of the Bank of England. as usurero, but maintali that the present high rate of discount will not check the exportation of the precious metals to America. R1 Warrens has an article In the Oestereichsche Zeitung on the ;; Bank Queation," which is considered a masterpiece by the speculating, stock-jobbing world, and declared to be " stuff and nonsense" by men who have made political economy their stady. The following passage will suffice to givo you an idea of the singular opinions entertained by M Warrens on financial maatters - " The present system, according to which the banks pro. mres to give on demand gold for their notes, cannot long, and, indeed, need not, be maintained. Such a promise, which cannot to a certainty be kept, is neither necessary, wise, nor moraL It neither contributes to the solidity and solvency of the banks, nor to the security of the trading world. It is the principal cause of the cisitinunallyrecurring convuolsion and crises in the commercial world. It appears to us that it would be more rational, beneficial, and natural If the banks engaged to redeem their notes at certain fixed pertods," &o. It may be observed that the pen of the writer of this nonsense is frequently employed by the Minirter of Finance, who is said to have relinquished the Idea which he for a time entertained of empowering the Austrian Bank to raire its rate of discount, which is stil but 5 per cent. Recently the promium on the precious metaLs has risei, and the probable cause of the rise Is, that during the present crisis vast quantities of Austrian Government and private stock havye been sold here for the account of foreign. houses, and the 'remittances for this stock made in bills on London, Parls, Amsterdam, Frankfort, and Augsburg, which are naturally equivsaent to hard cash. As the Bank has not resumed its cash yments, Baron Bruck is Inclined to flatter hiself that the evil in not very great, but it appears to me that it makes little difference whether money. or money's worth-is sent out of the country. There Is not yet any official confirmation of the report of the approaching reduction of the army, but it is related in military circles that no fewer than 6,000 hors are to be sold. Aa has already been stated, the reduction in the regiments of the line wil be very great, The conflict between the. Austrian bishops and the inmates of the Benedictine convents In their respective dioceses has already commenced. IDuring the " visitation" at Molk sharp words were exchanged between the bishop and the mitred abbot of the convent, and the latter is said to have expressed his intention to resign his office as chief of the monastic community if the diocean meddled in matters which did not concern him. It has been remarked that the Roman hierarchy is only intent on " reforming" those convents which are wealthy, and the public is much incdined to fancy that they would be left in peace if they would consent to contribute a good round sum towards the necessities of the Papal Government. Pome sells "indulgenceP" to laymen, and there is no good reason why she should not be as complaisant towards the clergy. During the last fortiht the medical profesors and students at tJae General Hospital of Vienna have been in a state of great excitement and irritation. The Archbishop of Vienna not long since gave orders that all the persons who died in the various hospitals and in the lying-in and foundling establishments should be buried without either post mortea examination or diecdon7 and the consequence of the measure Is that durmg the last 10 or 15daystherehas onlybeen one "subject " in thegreat dissecting halls of the General HospitaL Vienna was proud, and had good reaon tobeproud,of its medical school, but the Concordat has given into the hands of the clergy the power to ruin its reputation. According to a decree of Joseph IL, the body of every ,person who died in the public hospitals was to be opened or dissected, as the case might be, but the Imperial ordinance has de faco been abrogated by the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna. PRUSSI (snox oVA owN cO aRoXDs1.j BERLIN, Nov. 7. There is but little that is newr or stirring to report from here to-day. What amount of work may be going on in the interior of the different Minisrien unseen by public eyeo may be of value and interest to the internal welfare of the State, but it will hardly form very iateresting matter for distant readers. The prevnsional position occupied by the Prince of Prussia at the head of affirs wll preclude any Government measures from being prepared for the next Prussian Diet which involve any new principle in Prussian statecraft, or any great modification of the principles hitherto recognized and acted upon; and, as this Is the case, it will be unnecessary for me to dilate upon any reports of intended attempts said to have been contemplated by a portion of the Ministry to introduce during the next Diet a very retrogreessve change in the existing oonstitution or charter; whatever amount of reality such plans may have had they may be looked upon now certainly as abortions To this extent undonbtedly-vsiz,thatof preventiagretrogreasion-the Prince of Prussia's previsional administration of affair may be recognized 8s efficacious; but its very provisional and vicarious nature excludes anything like the inauguration of a new era; the greatest care is evidently being observed by the Prince and by all his well-wishers to prevent the acts of this his provisional government being in any way looked on as bearing the ampress of his on character, sympathies, and aspirations, or as offering any grounds for prognorstication as to wrhat his own acts would be when called to mount the throne. Hs Royal Eighness has taken up the conduct of State affairs, which had fallen into abeyance) and is carrying them on with the existing organs of the Government, and confines his activity to giving validity to such measures a;s had been already prepared in conformity with the King's wilL Ars a measure of precaution against possible misrepresentation he never admits any single Minister to confer with him alone, but only in ,he presence of the MinisterPresident, and I in my small sphere will also adopt another measure of precaution as regards my countrymen that falls -within my journalistic department,-viz, I will inform your readers that ths Ereuz Zeitug irs already beginning to inflict its countenance and patronage on the Prince of Prusia, as it didsometime backon the Government. As perhaps nothing during the late war tended so much to produce disgwst and contempt in England for the Prussian name as the contents of that paper, so I would desire, "in season and out of season," to caution your reader,s against allowing the popularity -which the Prince of Prussia enjoys in England to be in r.ny -way diminished or tarnlished by the favour which this paper isdiped to extend to him., The Zeit of this morning informs us that the Bank of Prusda has come to the resolution to raise its rate of discount from 6i per cent, to 7i ; as no mention is made of a rise in the rate of interest for loans on tangible securities, called here " Lom - bard," it is to be presumed that it remains the same as before. However this latter may be is of little importance, inasmuch as for some tiae past the Bank has endeavouredas much as possible to restrict this branch of business. The Ministerial paper is at some pains to convince its readers of the realmotives of this additional advancein the rate of dlscount, coming as it does on the back of a rise ade only about a fortnight back. ItIs not any violent increase or over-speculation, we we told, or an healthy extent of trade responsibilities at home, that requires thia screw to be put on, but rather the high rate of discount abroad, which, as long as the rate here was considerably lower, had a tendency to drain this place of its floating capitel This explanation would, of course, be perfectly superfluous to a Londoner or a Hamburger, acoustomed as they are almost necessarily to recognize the mutual influences of the different money-markets'; but to this population it is of the greatest urgency, since ita spbere of commercial observation is very limited, its financial apprehendons very narrow, and its fears of Government intervention in private affairs very lively. This rise in the rate of discount here, even if it had been to the extent of 2, 3, or 4 per cent., ought to be hailed with joy by every Prussian, for the sake of0the admission which the Government makes simultaneously with the alteration. It Is now admitted in the columns of the Zdt that the value of money cannot be maintained here, high or low, without reference to its value In the other money-markets of Europe; while this has been hitherto maore or less openly asserted in the positive by the organs of the Ministry, under who3e supreme control the management of the one State Bank of Prusda is carried on. It is hardly a twelvemonth back since the Bank Directors determained cautiously to raise their rate of discount i per cent. ; but the Minister put his veto on it, on the ground that there wa nothing In the otate of Prusia trdo wblbh oaJlod for aU in- crease, and what the value of money was elsewhere was of no consequence; since then the Bank has been compelled, with a view to Its own safety, to raise its rate of discount three times3; this occasion is, however, the first time that the admission has been made openly of the influence exercised on Berlin by foreign money-markets. This false principle has been maintained as long as it was possible to deeeive tho people for the purpose of enabling the Government. to raise its loans readily and cheaply; for the same purpose the usury laws have been retained in full vigour and all their absurdity, and, at the same time, Government steadily and sternly refuses all permission for the establishment of private banks or of any. money instittion which might enhance the value of money or raise up a monetary power in the kingdom not absolutely under its control. The result of this restrictive and repressive course of policy in money matters is, that all large amounts of capital seek employment abroad, while here m"anufactures, commerce, and agriculture are starving for want of it. Restriction, re-, pression, protective duties, and arbitrary con-' trol on the part of tho State and Municipal Governments, the police, and the trades' uniona have produced this unenviable result-that to any one not in a position to enjoy luxuries livmig here as dear as in London. I will put this statement lbefore you in a perfectly unmistakeable phapee, -viz., any given amount of money will purchase in London a larger quantity or i More durable quality. of almost every rieces: sary of life than it will here. Articles of foot are, from their very nature, excluded from this^ statement, but It is so thoroughly' true of all textile fabrics, whetber of cotton, wool, or silk, and of all hardware goods, that any resident here will find it more economical to purchase such articles at London current prices, pay all expenses of transport, duty, ald agenta commisdon, than buy them here in the next street. This asertion will be scofed at by the whiole deluded body of Government-rldden' victims here, butT have myselfsubstantiated tnetrathi of it too frequently andatoo carefully to hesitate a moment in declaring it openly. Life In Eng-I lInd is on the whole dearer than life here only because Englishmen will have around themi a large amount of comforts that are aocssdble to them. IMfe in Prussia is cheaper only because the people are, as in some cases, entirely ignorant of the exietence of the eomforts, or, in others, are resigned to do without what they cannot afford. The only notion of;ecnoniy prevalent In PhissiaIs abataining from spendiag instead of ener rsing a judicious judgment m expenditure, so as-to obtain much comfort for little money, they exercise asceticism and deprive themselves altogether of the article dered. -The balance of the entire expense of living in favour of Prussla is but a poor repreeitatlve of the balance of comfort in favour of Englatcd i The difference between England and Prussia in respect of economy cannot be better defined than has already beeni done by Solomon hli his Proverbs . " There is that scattereth and yet increaseth, and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty."

COOI,IES IX THE TVWEST INDIO& TO THEE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-The fearful scenes which have so frequently been enacted in vessels conveying Coolies to Cuba,:coupled withtbe treatment to which they have been subjected after their arrival by the slaveholders In that island, have led a large portion of the British publio to View with displeasure the introductionx of Coolie immigrants into the British West Indiea There is, however, no country In the world in which the labouring population can so soon raise themselves to a state of independence as they can do the colony of British Gulana, where in one single parish the negroes have pur. chased several valuable estates, at a cost of upwards of 45,0001. sterling. The Portugese immigrant3, who arrived destitute and penniless, have improved their condition in a greater degree still, many of them having In the courae of a few years; amassed considerable fortunes; and I now enclose a certified extract from an official letter of the Immigration Agent General, dated the 30th of Sept. ult., which shows that 249 adult Coolies who have lately left Dernerara on their returm to Calcutta in the ship HamDla Miltchell, have carriedwith, them the sum of $28,959, the amount of their savings during a residence in the colony extending In no case beyond, 11, and in many instances to only six ey In addition to. this stun, which was all In bUls of exchange, they had on their persons a large amount of gold and silver in the forml of ornaments; and, although the amount of money belo.-ging to them is larger than any previous set of Coolies had ever taken with them, there has been no Instance in which! they have ever had lees than $20,000. I The colonists, nevertheless, are bound to provide them' with a free return passage; and, though they comply with this onerous condition, are unable to obtain one.tenth pare of tho number that they require, while they are absolutely prohibited from procuring people from either Africa or China. The people of England profess to be anxious to put dowvn the ilave trade, and the great majority of them are, doubt. less, sincere in their professions; but It Is well known that the slave trade is carried on in Cuba to as great an extent as ever, and while such enormous profits are realized by thl traffic this will continue to be the case. The only feasible means of checklng it is to render the trade le profitable, and there is no mnode inwhich this c4 be accomplished so easily as by the introduction of fro labourers into a country where there is an inexhautible sua ply of the most fertile land In the world, peculiarly adapted for the growth of cotton, sugar, and all other tropial prqduotions, though now lying waste from wnt of the neoes. sary labour; while ne valid objection can be raised to tbp Introduction of immigrants into a colony where they hav". sucb unexampled facilties for improving their conditlon, and where they are under the protection of British la*s I administered by paid magistrates appointed by the Crown.

TH,B 4C00DEZ7T AT TMEB .AXCH OP 2'H1 Z E PA 2 HA X. Yesterday afternoon an inquest was held at the ?opl,r Hospital before Mr. Baker, coroner -for the eastern division of hiddleser, on the body of Jobn Donovan, one of the labourers who waainjured in theattempted launch of the Leviathan steamship on Tuesday last. It will be remem. bered that five persons were seriously Injured, four of whom were taken to the Poplar HiRital, where Donovan died on Friday. Two of the remaining sufferers are in a fair way of recovery, but another, named Stacey, still lies in a very precarious state. Mr. Brunel, the en=eerto the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, and Mr. Dion, the principal engineer at the works, were in attendance during tha inquiy. Tbe Coroner, before entering upon the Inquiry, explained to the jury the state of the law In reference to cases of mansLaughter wrhere death had resulted from want of due care and cantSon, and remarked that the case which was about to engage their attention was a very peculiar one. The injuies frotu whicb the deceased died were received in an atteinpt to launch the largest vessel ever constructed to swim uyon the water-the Leviathan-a vesel weighing more than 10,000 tons. No doubt, very great carei and expense had been employed to guard against accident, though, unfortunately, they had not provod effectuaL It would be necessary, before completing the inquiry, to examine the chief engineer, Mr. Brunel; but he wished that gentleman distinctly to understand that he wrs not bouand to Asmwer any queston likely to criminate himsef. w orge Ross, labourer, of St. James's-stree, Limehous, wa then examined. He sald,--I knew the deceased, Jo Donovan, who was a labourer, and was aged about 75 years. We -were both present at the attempt, to launch the Leviathan on Tuesday last, and were pacid at Qur respective statlons at U o'clock in tbe mornlig. The attempt to move the vesel did nottake placo till Abut an hoar, afterwards. When we were "placed" we received special instructions. I was employed at the tackle attached to the chain for eaing the ship on her progress to the water. I received diteotions from hr. Ewing, the foreman, to unhook the tackle as soon as the ship started, A man was placed between the drum aud the ship, who was to hold up sis hand as a signal, upon which I was to unhook the tckle, The signal was given, and I accordingly unhooked the chain; I turned round immediately and saW Donovan thrown up by the handle of a winch connected with the drum. The winch went round with great velocity, and Dononn was thrownupwardsabouteightfeet. Hefellunponhisbach, and when I picked bim up he was quite insensible. I carried him to neighbouring publlchouse, whence he was conveyed to the Poplar Hospital, where he remaineduntilihe died, on Friday morning. The Coroner.-Can you sate the cause of the winch revolving with such velocity? Witnees.-I saw that the ship had moved and that It had caused a strain upon the check chain. She appeared to haxv moved'about four feet down the incine when she wFS stopped bodily by the brea By A Juror.-The accident was not occasoned in consequence of the check being removedL By the Coroner.- What I did had no effect In moving the ship. She was started by the application of hydraulio power. The breaks were appled upon a signal given by the hoisting of a red flag from a platform near the ship. The signal was obeyed momentarily, and the ship stopped. I saw none of the signals that were made from the river. The Coroner.-As far as your observation went, are you able to ascribe blame to any one I Witness.-Not to any one. The Appliances and mean for the launch appeared to me to be quite suffclient. The Coroner here inquired if Mr. Brunel wished to ask the witnes any question. Mr. Brunel sad he attendedthe inquest as a witnegs and he would rather not act as an advocate. He believed, how, ever, that the witness had stated everything that he was likely bo know. He was simply employed to perform a par. ticular duty. Mr. Matthew Brownfield, house surgeon of the Poplar Hospital, said,-The deceased was brought to the hospital shortly before 2 o'ock on Tuesday last. He was inensible, and was suffering from a comrninuted fracture of the left leg, a contusion of the left arm, and contusions on the upper part and left side of the head. He died on iday morning from the injuries which I have described. Mr. L K. Branel was nex examined. He said,-I am a cvil engineer, and am the engineer employed in the constructior cS the Leviathan steamship. I was present at the timneof the attempted launch. The vessel belongs to the Eastern Steam Navigation Company. Her Government measurement is 23,000 tons; herlength is 690 feet; breadth, 83 feet; and depth, 56 feet. The Coroner.-She is. She Is the largest ship known in the universe X r. Brunelt-She Is an iron ship, and her specifio weight is 10,300 tons. The Coroner.-Perhaps you will now explain the reason for launching her sideways, insteadof stern on. J6r. BruneL-The only reaon was that it would have been impossible to put so large a vesse on an angle sufrl. cient to launch her in the ordinary manner. Thero is nothing nevr in the operation. The Amerlcan vesels are genery hlamnched broadside on, and at Liverpool the large iron fioatingvessels are also launched in that manner. The machinery which was used on Tuesday consisted principaly of two hydraulic presses, one at each launchingwa. One was a 10 and the other a 12 inch press. I cannot tell what pressure was at on them at the time of the accident, but it could not nave exceeded 100 tons at one and I50 at another. I do not think that so heavy a pressure was on At the time. At each launching-way there was a powerful chain tackle of 21 inches, weighing about 5 cwt. a fathom, wound round a dram 8 feet long and 8 feet in dismetet, with a powerful break. In addition there were large chains from the ship fore and af t, carried out to barges and then brought back to the shore and worked by steam engines. There were also the four barges with powerful purchases worked by hand. They were only to assist in easng the launch if required, and they were not used. Attached to the great drums there was a checking chain with ordinary wlheel work and handles which had been used for winding the chain upon the drum, and were kept on for the purpose of unwinding the drnm in case the ship did not move easily. To each drum at some distance behind there was an ordinary crab with a rope tackle to assist in overhauling the great chain in the event of the ship not moving and our wishing to slacken. That was the tackle to which the witness Ross has referred, and had nothing to do with the startng or the machinery of the ship. Ross's business was simply to undo the tackle if it was not wanted. No signalo any importane was given to him, but he stood in a good position to see what occurred. MIr. Dixon, the principal engineer at the works, stood in the centre near the stage referred to by Ross, which was placed halfway between the two drums, in order that any signal from it might be seen clearly from both. The operations which I directed to take place, and which led to the accident, were as follows :-I directed a certin length from each chain to be eased out from each drum, and the breaks to be gently applied to the drums. A light strain was then put upon the two presses, and a small strain brought on the tackle at the stem and stern of the ship. As soon as the pressure from the presses came on the ship she moved more frely than I had contemplated, and the pressure upon the breaks was barely sufficient. That on the foremost drum was just sufficient, and checked the shi But for the accident at the other end of the ship she woud probably have gone on slowly. As the aftermost drum was at rather the heaviest end of the ship the pressure upon the breaks was not sufficient, and the sudden strain upon the chain moved the big drum a little beyond the slack which had been given out, and by the jerk made the hAadles revolve rapidly. Four men had hold of the handles at the time. Ten men properly belonged to these handles, of whom the deceased was not one, and the bulk of them had very properly withdrawn from the handles as directed. The instant the accident occurred the breaks were put on tighter, and the operations of the launch were suspended for the moment. The Coroner.-Then you ascribe the accident to the ship having moved more freely than you calculated upon? Mr. BruneL.-Yes, and also to the breaks not having been on so firmly as we shall have thema another time. The Coroner.-You mean when the launch is again attemipted? Mr. BruneL-Yes. The vessel is novw held in chains. Two preventive chains have been put on, but they are not yet taut. By a Juror.- Three of the men at the handles were at their proper post. They ought to have withdrawn, but I cannot blame them for what they did, as I have a strong impression that if I had been at the drum myself Ishould have laid hold of a handle. I may say, perhaps, thatI may blame myself, for I did not anticipate that the handles would have revolved so rapidly. Andrew Ewing, examined, said e was the foreman employed over the labourers statlioned at the chain. He showred them their stations on the previous evening, and explained the duty that each would be required to perfornm The orders given at the druau were in writing, and uired the men tw,attend to the signals and the breaks of thebi drums, A white flag was the signal for slaokening out thehain from the drutm, and the red ilag for applying the breah There was no disobedience of orders. When the nicpmove a jerk came upon the drums, whch caused the handles t, turn round with great velocity. Therewere about 40 tons of chain upon the drumL Six men were appointed to each break and ten men at the handles to ast in slackening the chains. T!he men were required to lay hold ofthie har,dte> wvhile suciekng the chain, hbut wrhen the chain had bce1; slackened they ought to have stood back. The deceased wa s not at his proper post wrhen the accident occurred. HIe hadl been appointed to a crab at some distance off, and I he hai remained at his post he would have been out of all danger. The ship was stopped the moment the sigtal was gi eo apply the breaks. The break 'were duffilcentto stop heX and, in point of fact, did stop her instAntly. Nothing gave way; everything was strong enough.l No blame attached to any one, but, on the contrary, all reasonable precautloqs 'were taken to prevent accident, both as to the quality and solidity of the machinery employed. - Pichard Webb, one of the labourers stationed atibe breaks, stated that at the time of the accident the deceased man Donovan was partially seated upon the handle. Witness distinctly heard the eDgineer m charge of the drum give the order to " stand clear." This was the whole of the evidence. The Coroner, addressing the jury, observed that so far as the deceased was concerned it was clear that he had&4o business at the breaks, and therefore to some extent he had been the cause of his own disaster. It would, however, be for the jury to state whether there had been any want of care or caution on the part of Mr. Brunel, or of the persons in charge of the works. The jury returmed the following verdict :-'Aecidental death, caused by the deceased's own imprudence."

In a fortnight the. whole population of London would be moved in the omnibues diow running In the nethrpoliz. The vehicles are workedh by 6,2295 horses, more than the whole of the Bitish cavalry engaged at Watierloo. The average cost of each horse Is a., malring a total value of nearly 200,0001. The harness costs, on the averag, 1. for each horse, and the omnibus 120f eauh In building. The provender for these trOops of horses Is somewhent stsrtling in its aggregate, and the quantities required will serve to convey an idea of the exertions necessary to bemade for a commisar1 iat department for the movement of a army in a foreign country.

IIPROVEMMS IN THE PARKS%-For the 12 months during which the works were in progres St. James's Park looked miserable enough. At lengththeworks are nearly at an end. The bed of the lke is levelled, the bridge is completed, and the ter, intead of being in a fouand fcetid state, is now clear and pure-in fact, much better than Is supplied by many of, the water companies for the consumption of the public. Sinoe the bridge has been thrown open from 23,ODO to S0,000 persons cross it daiy. But, further than this, by the pulling down of Covent, garden Theatre An oportunity was obtained of nrocuringan immense ma of bnric rubbish. This was oeaery embraced, and the whole of the paths and footways have been entirely remade,which was much required. Several fresh Paths have also been made for the convenience of the pubHc. But while so much has been done In St. James's Park, ZHde Park has not been overlooked. People were surprised at the thousands of loads of rubbish that were being brought into the park, and dark hints were thrown out that the Chief Commissioner had some dangerous project in view, and that he ought to be closely watchea. These parties however, have only jutt dibovered that fresh roads aud paths and flower-beds are being made, which al admit are b vast improvement, and wil add materially to the beaut. of the par. Opposite Albert-road a now entonoe, with a very bandsome lodge, is about to be erected by the proprie tors of-the adjacent property. With respect to the Serpentine, we have no doubt but that the Chief Coramis. sioner looks at it with a longing eye, and would like to seive It as he has done the ornamental lake in St. James's Park; but there 3s the House of Commons to be faced. The contrast botween the waters in the two parks may soon induce the financial reformer to consent to the expenditure of a few additional thousands to render our beautiful Hydo Park perfect.

LAW REBPORT. COURT OF 0HARCERY. LY nAT.%'Q.TVk- NTu 0 GREAT NORTIERI}N RAILWAY PREFERENCE SHIARE. HO01.01tPZ 31LNRY i6AD O"TMS V. TIE GRCAT NORTHERN RAILWAY COMPANV (Befcre the LosD CHaOELLoR and the LosDs JUSTICES oF APP.) Thls was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Wood made on the 24th of August last. The plaintiffs aro holders of various amounts (135.0004, in the aggregate) of the four description3 of preference stock issued by the Great Northern Railway Company under the p,ve rs of the following Acts of Parliament:-The first descrintion of Great Northern Railway preferencoe sharesare .5 per cent. perpetual, and were Issmed under the provisions of the Great Northern Railway Acts Amendment Act of 1849, which enabled the company, with the assent of three-fifths of the votes at any general meeting, to guarantee dividends not exceeding 7 per cent. per annum in preference to the payment thereof on ordinary shares. The next preference shares are 6 per oent. redeemable, at a premium of S per cent., issued under the authority of the Great Northern Railway Acb, No. 1, 1851, which made It lawful for the company to raise 750,0001. for completing the raUway by newr shares, on which tho company, with the assent of three-fifths of the votes at a general meeting, might guarantee the payzient of dividends not exceeding 7 per cent. per annum in preference to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares of the company. The next description of preference shares was issued under the Great Northern Railway Company's Increase of Capital Act, 1853, whereby the company -was authorized to raise 750,0001. by creating new shares which should bear and receive dividends at 4Q per cent. per annum in preference to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares of the company, redeemable at six months' notice on payment of 10 per cent. premium. The last preference shares were issued under the Great Northern Railway Act, 1855, whereby the company were authorized to raise the further sum of 1,000,0001. by shares the holders of which should be entitled to the payment of fixed dividends st 6 per cent. per annum in preference to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares. The certificates of these shares all referred to the Acts of Parliament nuder which they were created. It will be recollected that Leopold Redpath during a period of a series of years frAudulently falsified the share-books of the company and appropriated to his own use a sum exceeding 200.0001., and It therefore became necessary to see out of what fands of the company this dofalcation should be made good. The net revenue appUcable to dividend for the half-year ending the 31st of December, 1856, was 243,9231. 5s. Sd., bat at that time the forgery of stock'by Redpath had been discovered. The valid stock not being easily distinguishable from the forged no dividends could safely be paid, and asthe holders of the forged stock appeared to have purobased it bond fie, and for value, the company were advised to apply to Parliament for an Act to make valid the spurioas stock, and to authorize the payment of dividends thereon. In their report to the company of the 4th of March the directors recommended the adoption of this course, and added that they could not take upon themselves to propose or support any Bill which should throw upon the preference shareholders any portion of the loss. The directors also Introduced into Parliament a Bill recognizing as valid the spurious stock, and authorizing the purchase of an equal amount of stock out of capital which the existing Acts of the company still authorized them to raise. Upon this Bill being laid before Lord Redesdale, the Chairman of Comr mnittees in the House of Lords, he objected to the creation of fresh capital, and insisted that the loss should be paid out of revenue and within a limited time. At the general meetingofthecompanyheld subsequently, on the 12th of March, after considerable discussion it was resolved "that no dividend be declared, but that this meeting considers It desirable that the balance of 243,923M. 5s. sd. mentioned In the directors report should be applied to meet the losses caused by Redpath referred to in the directors' report, and that the directors be and are hereby requested and authorized so to apply the said balance when and in such manner as they may consider most beneficial to the company." An amended BIll was thereupon introduced into Parliament, which, like the first, made vaUd the spurious stock, and required the directors to apply the above mentioned net balance of revenue and any moneys to be received by the company from Redpath's estate in paying the expenses occasioned by his frauds, in purchasing from time to tLmn stock to the amount of that forged, and forthwith cancelling the same, and as to any surplus that might remain, to apply the same, as far as it would extend, in pay. ments in order to the different classes of the preference shareholders for tho dividends to which they would have been entitled if the said net revenue had been apportioned as dividend at the general meeting of the 12th of March. By the 139th standing order of the House of Commons "no railway company shall be authorized to alter the terms of any preference or priority of interest or dividend which 8hall have been granted by such company in pursuance of, or which may have been confirmed by, any previous Act of Parliament, or which may otherwise be lawfully subsistIng, unless the committee on the Bill report that such altetlon ought to be allowed, with the reasons on which their opinion is fonrded, together with the number of preference shareholders who have assented to or dissented from such alteration." The Bili was introduced into Parliament, without reference to this standing order, as a Bill which did not by its provisions affect to deal with any right of preference shareholders. There being some doubt, however, whether the Bill might not indirectly be held to have that effect, the preference shareholders appeared before the select committee of the House of Commons, and endeavoured, although without success, to have a clause introduced express1y recognizing their rights. Upon the Bill going to the House of Lords, where no suc-h standing order exists, the directors, apparently thinking that somlething to authorize the confiscation of the rights of the preference shareholders ought to appear on the face of the Bil, proposed, after the latter had again failed to procure the insertion of an express clause in their favour, to add to clause 3, which directs, as already mentioned, the appUcation of any possible surplas, the words, " and thereupon the said sum of 243,9231. 5s. 8d. shall be considered to have been duly divided among all classes of shareholders in the company." This addition was opposed on the third reading,hbut earried on a division by the majority of 53 to 7. It asR, however, withdrawn in the House of Commons, and the Bill was returnec by them to the House of Lords with the,following reason for their disagreeing from the amendrnent:- ' Because the said amendment, if adopted, would decide a question of law in dispute between the preference and ordinary shareholders of the Great Northern Railway Company, which ought to be left to the decision of a court of law." The Lords thereupon did not insist upon their amendmJent and the BiU passed as it now stands. The object of the suit was to obtaiu a declaration that the plaintiffs and other preference shareholders were entitled to be paid fUll dividends from the 30th of June, 1856, before any dividends should be paid to the ordinary shareholders, and to restirain the company by injunction from declaring or paying dividends to the ordinary shareholders without regard to such right of the plaintiffs and the other holders of pTeference stock. The judgmeut of the Vice-Chancellor, now appealed from, was to the effect that the plaintiffs and other holders of preference stock were entitled to be paid dividends out of the profits realized by the company from the 30th of June, 1856, before any payment of dIvidends to the holders of the ordinary original stock, the A stock or the B stock, out of such profits; and that a perpetual injunction be issued to restrain the defendants from declaring or paying any dividend upon the ordinary original stock, without regard to the rights of the preference stockholders to be paid in priority their dividends from the 30th of June. 1856. The Vice-ChanceUor also declared that the 31 .ection of theAct of 1857 wascumulative, by wayof security f .r. and not in substitution of, such r-eference dividends. The company were also ordered to pay the plaintiffs' costs. ?rom this decision the company, on behalf of the ordinary stockholders, now appealed. As it was an appeal from, the vhole decree, the plaintiffs' case was first opened. Mr. Daniel, Mr. Cairns, Mr. Speed, and Mr. Turner appeared in support of the decroe; the Attorney-General, Mr. Rolt, Mr. Denison, and Mr. R. Clarke (of the common law bar) were for the appellants. Mr. DA' NIEL, for the plaintiffs and, in support of the decree, said that the question arose under the Act of August last. In determining that questien It became importapt to see what were the rights of the preference shareholders irrespective of that Act. Now, It was manifest that the loss the company had sustained through the frauds of Redpath imust be paid out of its revenue in the same way asif a tunmol had broke in or the permanent way had been ripped up by an inundation. By the Act of Parliament in question the directors were required to agply a certain balance of revenue In payment of such loss, wvhch made it impossible to pay the dividends then due upon the preference shares and It was contended on behalf of the ordinary shareholders that such payment was a Parliamentary satisfaction of the dividend so far as the prefer. ence shareholders were interested therein. He (Mr. lDaniel), nowever, would contend that the Act had no such effect; all that was intended thereby was to postpone the right of the preference shareholders until the loss from Xedpath'B frauds had been made good, for the Legislature could not have meant to take awavy a fund applicable for the payment of dividends to.the preference shareholders in order to cover losses arising from certain frauds some of which had been commtitted before the creation of several of such preference shares. His construction of the statute was that the rights of the preference shareholders had not been Interfered wish otherwise than to postpone the payment of dividends on their shares. Sueb shareholders had an absolute right to be paid the dividends guaranteed to them by the company, and after the rate specified in their shares, out of the profits of the company, whenever thev arose in preference to the payment of any dividend to the ordinary shareholders. Lord Justice KNiosir Bauc&.-Is it left arguable by the various Acts creating these preference shares that if there should be no dividend one half-year the preference shareholders should or should not be entitled to double dividends out of thenext half-yesr's profits Mr ROLT answered in the affirmative, and shated that each party contended for a construction in their favour. Mr. DAu,I& continued, and, after calling attention to the various Acts cratUng the preference sbares, urged that atthe meetings authorizing the issue of such shares no difference vhatever was contemplated between " aprefer=6e' and . guaraneed" stok. The intentionl of aU patties wag that tbe i;iahItAoldIra & 4i have a fize4 ivid§nd payable In preference out of whatever profits the company might make. There was no limitation for the preference share. holders to be paid from time to time whatever dividend, not exceeding a fixed amount, the profits of the company might allow; but their right was a general one to receive the faU amount of dividend whenever there should be a fand applicable for that purpose. The learned counsel then cited the cases of "Stevens v. the South Devon Ritlway Company" 9are), " Starge v. the Eastern Union Railway Company 7 inmes, July 1855), and " Crawford v. the North-Eastern Railway Com p any (not yet reported), and concluded by saying that the decision of the Vice Chancellor was consistent both. with law and common sense. Mr. C.&xae hIr. Srxn, and Mtr. T17PRN followed on the same side. The Awrommy.G=RAiz then proceeded to open the case for the appellants, bat had not proceeded far when the Court rose.

VICE.CHANC'LT,(OR'R COTTTTR.P Vnr i NFw Clr-?. rn'-- (Before Vice-Qhanacor Sir R. T. K DsRsLY.) Mr. Monck and Mr. Forsyth (of the common law bar), having been appointed two of Her Majesty's counsel, were this day called within the bar of this court. In IE LEXGG'S SETTLED ESTATES. Mr. KARSLAKE appeared upon the petition in this matter, the object of which was to grant certain leases, and upon which a difficulty had occurred in bringing certain legatees before the Court, and it was also a question whether, under the tarms of the 19th and 2,)th of Victoria, chap. 120. sec. 17 and 18, It was necessay to give notice to such persons ag encumbrancers. Upon these questions the decision of the Court had been reserved. The VICE-CrANCELLOR now said that the 17th section enacted that " the parties to answer or consent shall be all the persons in existence having any beneficial estate or interest by virtue of the settlement." If this were all, service was required to be made upon all these parties. But then came the 18th section, enacting that it should be lawful for the Court, if it thought fit, to give effect to any petition, subJect to and so as not to affect the rights, estate, or interest of any persons whose concurrence could not be obtained. This language was peculiar, but his Honour thought it was sufficient to enable the Court to make such an order as was now asked, it being expressed in the order that it was " subject and so as not to affect. the rights or interests' of the persons who had charges on the estate with respect to which it was desired to grant leases.
COURT OF OIJ.!'wq np.,t'Tr w- -- ,K, n 'rnP AlTrr 1A I- (S&ings tn BJanco, before Lord CAMIBEILL and Justices CoirEBIMGs WIGHTMI&N. and ERTFLz In this case the Court had granted a role calling upon James Goodwin, the master of a small grammar school at Sefton, near Liverpool, to show cause why a criminal information should not.be filed against him for the publication of certain libels imputing to one James Bird, a guardian of the West Derby Union, that, while a guardian, he had entered into certain contracts to supply the poor with flour and potatoes, and that he had supplied the same of an inferior quality, whereby he had defrauded the poor of the union. Sir F. TMSIGER (with whom was Mr. Cole) now showed cause against the rule, and said Mr. Goodwin was a ratepayer of the parish, and wrote the letters in question with a view to having an investigation in a matter in which he was interested, and with a bond fide belief that the charges were true. Under these circumstances he contended that, as there was no malice, the communication was privileged. The first letter was addressed on the 1st of May, 1857, to the chairman of the union, and contained a number of questions, in substance imputing to James Bird, one of the guardians, that while guardian he had entered into certain contracts to supply the poor in the union workhouse with potatoes and flour, and that he had suDplied the same of inferlor auality. The affidavits on w'hich the rule was granted did not deny the substance of the charges, but merely denied that the articles in question had been supplied under any contract made by the prosecutor while guardian; while the affidavits n answer showed clearly that for a long period goods had been supplied by the prosecutor while guardian, andthat he had on several occasions been present at the board when various sums of money had been ordered to be paid to him on account of the goods so supplied. When the rule was applied for the Court had been told that an Ropportunity had been afforded the defendant to substantiate his charges before a committee appointed to inquire into them; but it was now explained that the defendant had declined to attend that committee upon the ground that it consisted only of the chairman, the accused guardian, and the clerk to the board. The defendant required that all the guardians should be summoned to the investigation, and that the attendance of a magistrate to administer on oath should be secured, but this reqtiest was not complied with. Mr. BRETTr having been heard in support of the rule, Lord CAMPBELL said he thought this case was like that of "the Greenwich Hospital," in which Lord Erskine made his first celebrated speech. In that case the libel compLained of the adminiration of Greenwich Hospital, and it appearing that though the charges were not all true, they were made in good faith and without malice. Lord Mansfield and the whole Court decided that the application was answered, and that the rule for a criminal information should be discharged. Without, therefore, expreasing any opinion on the conduct of James Bird, his Lordship had no hesitation in saying that James Goodwin was actuatedby laudable motives, without any personal spite, but believing that he was cting for the good of the paupers ; and if he had reasonable grounds for what he did he was not to be blamed, in the situation in which he was, in endeavouring to procure an investigation. When the application was made he (Lord Campbell) was much struck with the stitement that the defendant had had an opportuiity of having the matter fairly investigated ; but that had now been clearly and satisfactorily explained, for it had been shown from the composition of the committee that a fair inquiry could not have been expected. It was not unreasonable to require that an oath should be administered to the witnesses, and that the parties should produce all the guardians at the inquiry. There was no proof of bad faith, but, on the contrary, itwasshown that the defendant was acting conscientiously, and in the belief that what he was doing was for the benefit of the paupers, Mr. Justice COLERIDGE said he was of the same opinion, and added that, in a case like the present, a person in the position of a schoolmaster would have great difficulties to contend with in promoting such an inquiry. Abuses of the kind referred to were most mischievous and oppressive, and the Court ought not to hold too strict a hand over those who sought to promote such inquiries. Mr. Justice WIGHTMAN said the question was not whether the charges were well founded, hut whether the defendaut acted in good faith in doing what he believed to be his duty, his lordship added that the facts might well warrant alr. Goodwin in believing that an improper system existed in regard to the paupera, and it appeared he had acted vwithout malice. Mr. Justice ERLE concurred, and added that, looking at the affidavits, he observed that the prosecutor, in denying the .breach of form. by impliecation admitted his guilt. He did not deny that he was interested in contracts in which the poor had been defrauded. Lord CASPBELL said the rule must be discharged, and with costs. CHiAP1fAN V. VAN TOLL. The plaintiff in this action, Mr. Chapman, was an attorney at Richmond, and he sued the defendant, a widow lady named Van Toll, to recover the sum of 491. 2s. lOd., being the amount of his biU of costs for work and labour done as an attorney. At the trial, which took place before Lord Campbell in this court on the 8th of May last, it appeared that the defendant had instruoted the plaintiff to bring an action against one Captain Roberts upon a bond given by the latter to secure the payment of l,0001. It appeared that on being served with the writ Captain Roberts, on the 16th of July, 1855, wrote the folowing letter, addressed to the defendant:- "July 16. M85. Madam-Yourproceedings have rather astonlshed me, knowing asyotu doe th ouhuaveo receivead atav^eral^9 times, over and above sourintree, te sm of£45, ad tereorean) that i6 legally coming to you isthe difference of £1l,020. via, £850.

"JULIUS ROBERTS, As- Y.Vu T-l, the Green, Rictunond." This letter wa; immediately forwarded by the defendapt to her attorney, Mr. Chapman; and it was contended at the trial that on the receipt of that letter, and seeing that Captain Roberts admitted his liability and only disputed the amount remaining unpaid, it became the duty of the attorney to apply to a judge, under the 3d section of the Common Lawv Procedure Act, 1854, and to get the cause referred and the account settled by the Master. Instead, however, of adopting that course, the plaintiff delivered a declaration and several tlmes gave Captain Roberts time to plead. ' The matter was thus thrownoverthe long vacation, but atleilgth, on the 14th of December, when briefs bad been delivered to cousel and the cause was in the paper for trial, the parties contended that applcation should he made to aj udge to have the account taken by the Master. This was accordingly done, but when the Master made his allocation Captain Roberts had become abankrupt, and nothing was recovered. It was contended that if the plaintiff had, in the first instance, proceeded under the 3d section of the act, and got the mater referred to the MTaster, the defendant might have got her money from Captain Roberts, as others had done, and that, as he had failed to adopt that course, he was gulty of negligence, which disentitled him to recover the amount of his bill of costs, amounting to 491. 2s. 10d. Lord Campbell, in summing up the case to the jury, said he thought the action was one of " mere account" within the meaning of the statute, and that the omission to proceed under the 3d section of the act was evidence of negli. gence. The jury, therefore, found their verdict for the defendant. Subsequently, a rule was granted for a new trial, upon the ground of misdirection, which rule now came on to be argued. Mr. Serjeant Snani and Mr. DOYLE showed cause against the rule, and contended that this came within the statute, t 'a matter of mere account, which cannot be con-eniently tried in the ordinary way," and that the direction of the Lord Chief Justice was right. Sir F. TiniSioiB and Mr. HAwxNs, who appeared in support of the rule, were stoenped by LOrd CAmPBELL, who said he was of opinion that there was evidence to be left to the jury of negUgence. It had long been a cause for regret that though the trial by jury was the best mode of trial ever invented by the wit of man, there ware many cases in which an action could be brought where the trial by jury was wholly unsuitable. An action might be brought where there were 100 itemns of demand every one of which might be disputed. In such cases a trial at Niti Prius was not desirable. It was often found tbst whgnu thie eprqnie of w trial and coureol had been incurred, and a jury summoned, the cause was quite incapable of being tried by a jury, and a reference was insistedon. To guard againEt this was the object, as he (Lord Campbell) thought, of that most salutary enactment, contained in the 3d sectionof the Common LPw Procedure Act, 1854, which enacted that if it be made appear to the Court or a judge that the matter in dispute consists wholly or in part of " matter of mere account which cannot conveniently be tried in the ordinary way," It shall be lawful for the Court, or a judge, to order the matter to be referred to an arbitrator or to an officer of the Court, or, in country causes, to a county court judge. The intention was, that the party to whom the cause was referred should sit down and look at the accounts and vouchers, and so decide. His Lordship thought that the case before the Court must be considerd as in the oontemplation of the Legislature. Here was an action upon a bond forl,0001. The obliger did not deny his liability, but he maidhe had made paymentE, and there was a balance due, and he was ready to pay the balance and to prove the payments. If he (Lord Campbell) had been sitting as a judge at chambers, and this application had been made, unlees strong opposition were offered and it were made to appear that it oould be more convengenty tried before a jury, ne (Lord CampbeD) shouldhave ordered it to be referred. If it were shown that there was conflicting evidence, he (Lord Campbell) should have said that it ought not to be tried before an arbitrator, but before a jury. .'timd fade, he (Lord Campbell) should have said It was a case within the Act of Parliament and that it was the duty of the attorney, on receiving the letter of the 16th of July, to have made the application- and if so, the judge would have made the order, the party who wrote the letter would not have resisted the order, and in the course of July the account might have been gone into before the Master and the balance struck. Instead of that, there was a declaration, plea, trial, briefs for counsel, and then by consent there was an application to have the action referred. Had it been referrza in July tho plaintiff mfght have got the allocatur of the Master, while Captain Rob&ts was st}li solvent, and in all probabilty she would have recovered what was owing. But, as it happened, when the award came Roberts was insolvent, and she not only lost the balanoe of the ,OOOZ., but she was called upon to Nay the sum of 491. odd to her own attorney. If this case did not come within the statute, the result would be that Mr. Van Toll would lose her money. Mr. Justice Co0LxRnG said he had listened with great attention to what had fallen from Lord Campbell, but stiA he was of opinion that the rule ought to be made absolute. The question was not what was the true construction of the Act of Parliament, but whether that was so clearly one way that it was the duty of the attorney to make the applcation, and that his neglect to do so was to be visited by the non-payment of his costs. If the Iegsl'ature had meant in the 3d section of the Act to deal with matters of mere account, the words " which cannot conveniently be tried in the ordinary way" ought to have been omitted. There were some matters of mere account which could not be conveniently tried in the ordinary way, but there were others which could. This was an action of debt on a bond, and his Lord. ship thought the inference was not clear that it could not be conveniently tried in the ordinary way, seeing that three learned judges were of that opinion. Mr. Justice WIGmMAB said, he thought the question was whether the case so clearly came within the 3d section that it was a breach of duty for the plaintiff not to make the applcation. His Lordship thought it was not, and that theplaintiff might have thought It to be a case whiclimight very properly be tried in the ordinary way Mr. Justice RELE was of the same opion, Rule absolute for a new trial. VAN TOLL V. OllIMAN. Tnis was an action by the defendant in the former action against her attorney to recover damages for negligence, in which the plaintiff had obtained a verdict.

In the course of the day, The new Lord Mayor, accompanied by the Recorder, the late Lord Mayor, and the Sherffs, came into court and invited their Lordships to the entertainment to be given this evening in GuildhalL Lord CAMPBELL said, that some of their Lordships would attend.

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WEsT=sM. Nov. 9. BAMRNDAIE! V. TflI vAnv rvA. I--.- (SiUnas in Baneo. r.i,.mnq TPqrni This was a rule calling on the defendants to show cause wh- an injunction should not issue against them under the Rail. way and Canal Traffic Act. restradning them from charging a larger sum for goods coming from Manchester to Bristo, and thence forwarded on to Barastaple by the North Devon Raiway Company to the plaintiff, than they charged for goods forwarded by Carver and Co., through their agentj Mr. Wall, of Bristol. Mr. Lush and Mr. Milward appeared to show cause against the rule; Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Pollock in It appeared that the North Devon Railway Company advertlsed to carry goods from Manchester to Barnstap!e through Carver and Co., their goods-collecting agent at Manchester, and Mr. WAll, of Bristol, at 5Os. per ton. Their charge to the complainant for the same kind of goods from and to the same places is 52s. 6d. per ton, and against this differential charge, to the complainant's prejudice, the present injunction was moved. It appeared that the charge from Manchester to Bristol was 30s. per ton to both Carver and Co. and Baxendale, and the difference, therefore, existed between Bristol and B=&rstaple, but whether that difference of 2s. 6d. per ton was charged between Bristol and Crediton by the BrLstol and Exeter Railway Company, or between Crediton and Barnstaple by the North Devon Railway Company, did not appear by the affidavits. The affidavits, however, of the latter company did not set up that this difference of rate was not charged by them. In showing cause against the rule, It was contended that the North DevonCompany,by maling rrangements through Wall could convey a large quantity of goods at a less price, which wasfor the advantage of the public,and that if Baxendale chose to send his goods through Wall he would share In that advantage; and that if the arrangements through Wall were not carried out the company must increase the price to the whole of the publio, by placing the additional 2s. 6d. per ton on everybody. In support of the rule It was contended that the defendants mnst charge to every one of the public the same price; hut here a different rate was charged for goods carried through Wall, of BristoL. The CounT were of opinion that the rule should be made absolute, with costs!, restraining however its operation to the North Devon RaIlway Company. Rule absolute accordingly. At 2 o'clock the Lord Mayor, accompanied by the Recorder and civic authorities, entered the court, and having gone through the accustomed formalities, the Recorder, on behalf of the Lord Mayor, invited their Lordships to a banquet. The LoRD CHEF Jus=IoE (who with the other judges had previously retired to robe in their State robes, fullbottomed wigs, and caps) said, they would do themselves the honour to attend it. Several motions on technical points of practice were then disposed of, and the Court rose.

This was a special caue to try the right of the defendant to mnake a deduction against his landlord In respect of income-tax. The suxbject of the demise was a parcel of land let to the defendant by Sir B. B. Smith for a term of 14 years, 'with liberty to raine and dig clay, sand, and other materials for making bricks, subject to a surface rent of 171. 10s. per year, to a dead rent in respect of the brick earth, &c., taken of 1.001., and a royalty of 2s. onx every 1,000 bricks made. The question, which turned upon the construction of the various schedules and rules In the Act imosn income-taz, the .35th of George III., cap. 5, was as to the nature of the royalty with reference to the incometax; it being contended, on the one hand, that it was a rent or profit from the land in respect of 'which the landlord wss subject to income-tax, and, on the other hand, it was urged that it was a sale by the owner of the land of the brick earth, and the royalty was in the nature of the purchase mMrLusH argued the case on behalf of the plaintlffi &fr.

With the exoeptionL of three women, who were discharged for want of sufficient evidene., and.one youth commitd for a month for stealing a handkerchief, the prisoners were remaded for further examination. In four instances the property stolen condsted of watches, and in one instance of a portmonnaie, with its contents. A-letter carrier named Bichard Bel was charged with stealing a registered letter and two of Sculthorpesa " tet, " which had come into hisponesdon when act i As sorter t the Camberwell disrict poet-office, Camberwell-green. The registered letter having been discovered by ?inkn-y, the principal letter-crier, he ordered the men not to leave the offioe till it was found.

Pinkney then went for a policeman, ancdon returning with one found the missing registered io'ter on the table In front of the prlsoner. As it had iot been opened Its contents were not known. The other two letters were " tests," made up and posted by order of 3fr. Sdul. thorpe in consequence of the recentlosa of a registred lettei aLt the same office.

Feeling satisfied that thieves were in the house, she thre t up the window and clled "Polioe I A constable immediately made his appearace, and shewent downstairs and let him in. TheconstUble p-oceeded upstairs, and from a room on the second floor he brought down the prisoner, On looking about she saw ^vidences of robbery-papers and articles were strewn about in confusion, and a wittiig desk had been broken open. There was also an empty decanter -on the table; this decanter ras full the over-mght, and it soon became manifeat that the burglary had been detected in consequence of the prisoher haviug drunk the contents, and, becoming Intoxicated, had rolled against some crocker And knocked it down. Police-oonstable RedmilL O 114, sa£d, he heard the pry of "Police" from No. 2, Charles-street, and, being admitted by the last witnews, he went upstairs and found the priso!uer standing near a window, evidently the worse for drink The prisoner said, "It's abad job; rve made a- fool of iy. Eelf in drinldng so much sherry." Witness found property scattered over the rooms; the parlour floor was covered with papers, and a desk had been forced open. Several drawers and other places had been ransacked. There was a quantity of broken cikery on the floor, which accounted for the noise heard by the first witness. The prisoner had gained access to the house b climbing over the area railings and forcing the parlour wiidow. Witness picked up a chisel, wlhich fitted to the marks on the window. The prlsoner m id to him he was glad his two oompanlons were not with him - he wanted to go over the herring pond by himielf, but had he not drunk so much sherry no policeman could have taken him. The prisoner reserved hbis defence, and was fully committed. Charles Wyattw aged U years, was charged with stealing eight sovereigns, the property of his father, a respectable tradesman in Great Pultney-strEet. The mother of the boy said she found a box broken open and eight sovereigns stolen. Her son had also absconded, and was found at 3 o'clock that morning by a policeman without a farthing in his possession. The prisoner was at this court some short time ago, charged with an older boy with stealing two sovereigns, but as the magistrate considered the prisoner was possibly made a tool of by his companions, he was discharged. The boy admitted stealing the money from his paresits. He said he gave a cabman two sovereigns to drive him wherever he chose to go, The cabman drove him about to various coffeeshopos where the cab made a stop, and he gave the cabman a sovereign each time, but received no change, Remanded for a week. MAyRL3BoN-John Burnham, a labourer, was charged with assaulting Emma his wife a delicate-looking woman, with an infant in her arms, and residing with her husband at 32, Capland-street, Lisson-grove. He was committed to hard labour in the House of Correction for 'wo months. A labouring man named George Gibbs was charged with a brutal assault on Anne Shephard, Devonshire-street, Lisson grove. Mr. LONG said that the assault was one of such a nature as to call for a severe punishment, and sentenced the prisoner to two months' hard labour in the House of Correction. WEsTrsTm-Duncan Fraser and Edmund Chinnock, privates in the 2d Regiment of Life Guards, appeared on remand on their own recognizances, charged before Mr. ARNoLD with assaulting George Mouchet, teacher of languages, Church-row, Battersea, and Augusta Norton, an anfortunate woman, on Thursday night last, near the dead wall of Chelsea Hospital. The prisoners, who were brought up before the magistrate on Friday last, were remanded till the following day, Mr. ARNOLD expressing his intention to send the case to the sessions. On Saturday the prisoners attended, and Lieutenant Marshall, acting adjutant of the regiment, was present on the part of Colonel Martin, the commanding officer of the regiment. When the case was called on the complainant, Mouchet came forward, but the woman did not make her appearance. hr. ARNoLD asked if she had been seen in the court or neighbourhood that day l Mouchet replied, that she told him that she had had money offered to her, as he also had, but which she refused, and that bethought she would not attend. Lieutenant Marshall, who gave the prisoners good cha. racters for being sober and steady men, said, he was informed that the woman had been to the barracks, and that it was an entirely voluntary act on her part. He was perfectly ignorant of anything that had taken place respecting her. Mr. AsNcoLD said, it was most improper to interfere with a case which was before the court; and he again adjourned It to yesterday. When the prisoners were placed in front of the bar, Mr. ARNOLD inquired if the woman attended? A police-constable stated that he had seen her, and that she did not intend to appear against the prisoners. Mr. ARNOLD remarked that he supposed the woman had received some compensation, and said tbat the charge ought not to have been withdrawn from his jurisdiction in the way it had. As far as regarded the woman there was au end of the case, and he should not send the prisoners to the sessions, as the assault on the man was not of sufficient importance for him to do so. He then asked the prisoners what they had to say in answer to the charge of the assault on Mouchet. Both prisoners denied that Mouchet was knocked down, but they had no -witnesses. Mr. ARNOLD said he was satisfied with the evidence, and he should convict them. As the charge against Fraser showed that his conduct was the more violent of the two he should inflict on him a heavier penalty than on Chinnock. Fraser was fined 50s. or a month, and Chinnock 10s. or seven days. The fines were at once paid. Lteutenant Marshall said, that he was directed by Colonel Martin to state that since the last remand tho woman had called at the barracks. She saw Colonel Martin, who observed that he could not interfere while the charge was before the magistrate, nor could the regiment interfere in any way whatever. Thomas Green, a recruit of the Grenadier Guards, was charged with having enlisted by fraudulent represents. tions in the Grenadier Guards, by stating that he had not served in any other regiment. Captain J. Burgoyne, regimental-adjutant of the regiment, attended in supporl of the charge. The evidence of the gallant captain was to the effect that he was in charge of the recruiting department of the regiment. The prisoner enlisted on the 15th lit. in the regiment, and he was soon found to be a man of an incorrigibly bad character. Subsequently it was discovered that though he swore to the contrary) he had been in the Royal Mrnnes, and that after he had been there a short time the commanding officer wras informed that he had heen previously in the Artillery, he having swvorn, when attested, that he had not been in any other regiment previously, For that offence he Was sent by the civil power to Maldatone Gaol, where he was confined for three months. In the MEarines as also in the Artillery he maintained a had chazacter- ir. AR NOLD (to the prisoner).-Have you anything to say? Prisoner.-No, Sir.

CLRRNERWn-Joseph Martin, aged 45, a miserablyattired person of rather tall stature, describing himself as a railway contraetor, residing at 45, Little Drammond-street, Euston-square, was brought up in the custody of Sergeant Hill, 39 S and placed at the bar before Mr. CoRaix for reexamination, charged with obtaining several articles of ironmongery from Mr. William Fowler, an ironmonger, residing at 38, Skinner.street, Somers-town, and also with having defrauded numerous tradesmen of goods and obtained money from them under false pretences to the amount of several thousand pounds. Numerous tradesmen who have been visited by the prisoner and the members of the gang to which he belonged were in attendance to hear the case, which excited a great deal of interest. It appeared from the evidence taken on the previous occasion that the prisoner had called upon Mr. Fowler, an ironmonger, and Mir. Frost. oilman and colourman, of Charl9tte-street1 Fitzroy.sqMaFze, and represented himself as the working partner and ageat for the firm of Harris and Ferdinand, of the Brazib, having power to order goods of various descriptions for them. He also said that iessrs. Harris and Ferdinand were the owners of between 30,000 and 40 000 shares, and that it was their intention to erect a large cty, rwhich was to have 13 spacious hotels. e then produce a letter, when asked for references, and said le had got potwer to draw checks on the Union Bank of London to between 9,0001. and 10,000!. Sergeant Hil Inquired at the chief offioe in Prlnoe's-street and acertained thatthey had no account inthe name represented. Another practice of the prisoner was to give orders to different tradesmen and get references from them to others. When It has been remarked that his clothes were very thin and rather shabby, the prisoner sad he pireferred that sort of clothing to any other because% having been out in the West Indics and the Brazils, any other sort meltered him almost to death. The first witness called to-day was Mr. Arnold Goodwin, reslding in uilldford-street South. wark, who said, the prisoner called uponhim about six weeks ago ana ordered a quantity of brickmaking machinery, he at the eame time saying he was connected with a large house in San Paulo and the Brazils. He put him to great trouble and the expense of sending the invoice out there. About a fortnight afterwards the prisoner called and borrowed 5s He had sinoe found out t at the prisoner had been referring other tradesmen to him, and using the copy of his invoioe for that prpose. The prisoner he understood had been out to the Brazsla a brlckmaker. The prisoner mxde along rambling statement, and sla thatif time were given all the goods he had ordered wouldbe paid for as the firm he ropresented would send him the rmoney from the Brazlls3 He also threatened legal proceedings against the person who had liven him into custody. CoaRRni said, he should discharge the prisoner. He did not think there was a stron case, and although he did not believe the story of the prisoner that the goods woild be paid for, still they milght. With regard to the cuse of Mr. Goodwin, the offence was committed in Surrey, and they might charge him there if he liked. If there was any definite case present he was prepared to take it. Sergeant EHll suld, he had ascertained that the prisoner ad obtained money and goods in lambeth, but the parties were not then In attendanoe. Mr. COiRR said, the sergeant could take the prisoner to L-%mboth if he thought proper. There was no case at -pisent before him, and he thould diacharge the prisoner. i Thle Prisoner-A I can say is that I am what I represent myself, and all the goods vill be paid for.

It appears that Mr. Pocock had been the medical attendant of Mr. Nicholls aud his family for some years, and that all the parties had lived on the moat amicable terms up to a few weeks past, when the latter, without the slightest apparent cause, became extremely jealous of the former, comamited an act of assault on him, and has since served him wit, a notice of action for crim. con. For the aault Mr. Nicholls was brought to this court on a admmons last week, and was held to bail, and put in the required sureties to be of good behaviour towards Mr. rocock. Since entering into such sureties lr. Pocock felt that he bad reason to complain of Mr. Nicholls conduct, for on Thursday la1t he foUowed his carriage to the house of a patient, and paced backwards and forwrds in front of the gate in so apparently an excited manner that Mr. Pocock was afraid to come out the front way, but passed through the back premises, and thus avoided approaching him. Yesterday morning, in consequence of a gentleman calling at the Brixton station and representng that a breach of the peace was likely to take place in Loughborough-park, a constable in plain clothes was sent to the residence of Mr. Pocock, ann seeing Mr. Nicholls close by he requested that gentleman to accompany him to the station, and he did so. A charge of menacing and putting In bodily fear Mr. Pocock, he being atbthe time under recognizances, was then entered against Mr. Nicholls, and the parties subsequently attended before the Er. Pocock depuosed to his fear that Mr. Nicholls would do him personal violence, but neither he, his servant, nor the policeman could swear to the defendant's making use of any expresdon or gesture to justify that fear, or that he had carried anything about him except a elight umbrella. The strongest evidence given in the matter was that of Rachaci Deedman, an assistant servant to Mr. Nicholls, who deposed that on that morning she saw her master turn up one of the laths of the window blind and on seeing the carriage of Mr. Pocock he called out for his pun case. This gun case, In consequence of the state of mind which had latterly been exhibited by the defendant, had been arst deposited in the duethole, and subsequently in a cupboard at the bop of the house, and, on noebreing at once provided with a key to open the door, Mr. Nicholls seized a poker and threatened to break it open, an act which seriously alarmed the witness and Mr.Nicholls. Mr. Nicholls complaied of the course that had been taken against hima as unjustifiablo, and denounced some nameless persons who was in the background, of whom Mfr. Pocock aud his senants were but the CatEpaws, as conspiring to ruin and destroy his character and property, contending that there /was nothing in the ovidence to show that he meditated any assault or menace, and concluding a lengthoned adreslbyassuring the bench that it was not his intenton to have committed himself in any way. Mr. Eu.ioTT thought thatisr. Pocock was justfied in acting as he had done, and expressed it as his opinion that there was not the slightest ground for Mr. Nicholls's suspicions. But, even if there had been grous,d for them the law was open to him, and it was not to be tolerated that Mr. Pocock was to be followved about in the manner that had been described. Mr. Nicholls replied that he should pursue his action, but wrould promlise not to molest the complainant again. Mr. 13LLIOTT said, that on this promise he should dismiss the complaint, hut hoped at the same time that MIr. Nicholls wiould keep his word. MIr. Nicholls repeted that he would, but hoped in return that those oppoosed to him would not provoke his temper.

The annual traiuirg of the naval coas volnnteera for the WeLsh district haz just closed on board the Amphitrite, 26 gunrs. The men have had 28 days training, including practice with heavy guns, for which the waters of Milford Haven afford ample scope. The Rev. HI. E. Yeoman has been appointed chaplain to the Edinburgh, and joined his ship on Wednesday last. We have re3son to believe thaS there is no foundation for the report that Captaia Milne is about to leave the Admiralty for an appointment at Devonport dookyard. Yesterday Captain Wright's company of the 9th battalion Royal Artillery embarked at Wcolwich on board the screw transport Indomitable, Captain Kett, for Madras. A detachment of the 2d battalion 1st Royals, consisting of one officer and 50 men, and one of the 21st Foot, con. sisting of two officers and 48 men, left Glasgow on Thursday for Ealfast, proceeding thence to Cork for embarcation to Malta and Gibraltar. The following appointments have been made at the Admiralty:- C. V. Udney, midshipman, to the Heron; F. 0. L. Patoh, assistant-paymaster, to the Ajax; J. P. Dore, clerk, to the C 1j way; G. W.

BARRACK THIEVBS. TO THlE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-The nurber of thefts committed at the Camp, C rragh, is greatly on the increase. A few weeks ago an oniicer of the 15th liegiment lost a pair of dress bootb. The thief was fortunately arrested. A few nights rPo the qu'arters of the Colonel of the 99th Regiment were entered, and a gold ring with other articles taken away. No one w.-s in the ua7 ters at the time, and the thief, who found the key in the door, and knewv that the Colonel's servpnt woul.d only be absent for a few minutes, locked the door inside rnDiin-g bis esc7as probably by a window. The hut was soon ssarounded with men from tie neighbouring quarterb,uard, but all to no purpose. On the 7th of November a case con. taning a set of enamel studs, with turquois in the centre, set in gelk, with a gold bar at the back, was taken from the dresino table of an officer of the same corps, while another officer lost, on or about the 7th, a silver Geneva watch, out of repair (the namo of the maker, Biumie), which was taken out of a drossing-ease, with a pair o1 daxk brown dl,th gloves. A; information respecting these articles has been lodgtd v.;th the police, and there are no less than thrce pnhce-stations in the immediate neighbourhood of the camp, my object is not so much to make the loss more widlely known as to show that one of two things is ab-,olutely requisite if otficers are to be protected from a set of Fanundrels,- either that a body of soldiers should be trained and paid to act as deteotives, or that it should be medo an offence punishable by law for any Jewish or Chiistian Jswelier, any huckster, licensed as in England, or unlicensed as iu Ireland, any dog, stick, tobacco mnerchant, dealer in game or licentious pictLres, oyster sellet, or apple. woman, &c., to enter camps or barracks. In every barrack in which I bave been quartered I, in common with other officers, have been pestered not oDly by army tailors, but by the most suspicious-looking costormongers, who, after knocking at my door, have frequently walked into my room beforo I gave them permission to enter. Nor has any officer's wife wsho may be alone protection from their intrnsion or barefaced lies. If you offer to give them in charge, of course they dare you to do so, stating that they bear a pass signed by the Coloael of the regiment or the A, sistant Quarterinaster-Genoral, or by both. So long as tt1se promoters of thicrery are permitted to loiter about camp or barracks, to talk as they do with officers' servants, and to buy or barter from them their masters' goods, or to stoal thoso things themselves, no ofi5cer, however much he uay wish to believe that his hut or his room Is his castle, can feel hiinself secure.

THE FOREIaN CUSTOMERS OF TIE UNTED STATES. - Next to the disastrous conseqaences of the hard times at home, every one begins now to inquire whLt is to be the effect abroad. The last packet from Europe prepares us to look out sharply for the next. There begins to be a nervousness on the subjeeb anmon our importers and impolting a-Ents which increases with each Interven5ug day between this and the rebound from the last chapter of financial accidents sent forward by the packet of the 13'h of October. The iramense interests at btake among this class of merchants, not affecting their own property alone, but the bankers ia WYall-strect tbrough whom they have opened cred 2s, will sufficiontly account for the dreadfal state of suspense iato which they have been thrown. A rumber of them have yielded to the pressure In advance. Others have (ui.etly obtrined on extension of payment upon their credits. A third class have pafd iu part and thrown themselves upon the indulgence of thelr bankers here or correspondetits abroad for the remiainder. But there are hundreds yet standiug 'who have neither vavered in prompt payment nor struck their flag to misfortune or pressure In any form. It is these that feel most keenly the continued raging of the storm, and dread to hear the reverberation from Europe. The occason is an opportune one to know how we diatribute our purchases abroad. We shall not go into minute statistics on Lthe subject (even if at hazard for 1857, which they are not), but give a general average of the import trade results of the past financial year. The United States bought from Euro_pe in 1866, for consumption, $192,000,000 ; and from the Idies and South America 106,000,000-together $293,000,000; and we add to tho first named sum 10 per cent., and to the second 15 per cent, increase. We havo to account for S211,0C0,000 in Enropetn fabrics, aud $122,000,000 in the sugars, teas, &-c., of India, naking $=,000,000 in foreign goods taken for consumption duringthe financial year 1857, ending Jure30 last. The exact import figures for the year are F360,890,141, of which $12,461,799 was in specie, and $14 '05,509 In goods re-exported, leaving $333,522,S33 for consumption in the United States. Against this we sent to Europe and the Indies $132,000,000 in cotton, $126,000,000 In agricuRltral produce and in manufactures, and $60, 000,CZO In gold from thel ines of the Pacific Statestogether M338,C00,000-leaving a nominal balanca of to 000,C00 in favour of the Unitod States, in which ;:3,000,W00 is made up by the difference between the foreign c02U inward and outward during the year. The oxact trade balance, according to the official data, is l> ,05.9003, in favoar of the 'United States. The loss oa suspension, or material reduction of this large import trade, if equUlly distributed, would faU in something like the following proportions :-On England, 1120,000-O0; on France, 56,000,000; on Germany, V?',2E.C0,000; on Switzerland, 9,000,000 ; rest of Europa, '110 010 000 Total 5211,000,0ooi0. On theSpanish Indies, Zi6'C00,000; Brazil, $22,000,000; China, $12,00000;( iiitish Possessons, P32,000,000; rest of Indies, $20,000,Ch0o. Totl a 122,00J,000. llelativelv the heaviest embarrassnaent froma the check to the trade with the United States would he to France, Switzerland, and Germany, on account of fine cloths, silks, laces, wines, and other luxuries. The heaviest rr.dnction in amount will, of course, be felt by England. The loss to Cuba and other Spanish possessions will be in the reduction of price rather than extent of the sugar importation. The trade with the British possessions, including Canada, will probably be least affected. From Brazil we mnsnt continue to buy coffee freely, and the trade with China widi moet likely go on to nearly the usual amounlt.-Newz York T'i)=e. TarE MAziNFRsL WEALTH OF ENGLAND.-When we refleot on the fact that British miners have been searching our native rocks for metaUiferous minerals since rhe days when the merchants of Tyre supplied the ancient world, and that we are now drawing from the earth annually metals alone which hane a market value of 20,434,270Z,, we cannot but be struck with the enormous amount of mineral wealth which has been stored in the rooks of these " far islands of the West." From the "Records of Mining aud Metallurgy" we learn tbat coal has been worked since 1234 in N orthumberland; but at that period the quantity of fossil fuel raised must have been very smaL In the report of the committee of the House of Commons the consumption of coal In Great Britain in the year 1S27 is stated as 22,700,000 tons; in 1S56, according to the " Mineral Statistics," It had increasod to 66,645,450 tons. Tho ooalfielda of the united kingdom have been estimated to contain an area of 12,000 square miles, and various are the estimates which have been made to determine the time required to exhaust them. Little reliance can, we suspect, be placed upon any of these computations; but one thing is certain, the coal beds of Great Britain are not inexhaTistible, and with the falling off in the sunpply of fuel the staple manufactures of the country must decline, and Enigland must sink from her high estate to the position of a third or fourth rate State among the nations. Nearly 67,000,000 tons of coals are now raised from our collierier, which in 1850 numbered 2,829, and in every part of thscountry the price of coals Is advancing. France Is opeeing her ports to receivo British coals; Denmark, Prussia, It-ly, and Russia are our oustomers for both coals and coke. Egypt and the East Indies, the United States of America; Cbhl, Brazil, and China, are regularly receiring our fue] in quantities varying with each country annually from 33,000 Ions to 250,000 toQna-Afhe7aum,
Y.BELAND. (1B?O, 0UR OWN COPP tSPONIMNT.) DUBLIN, Mu-NDAY MORaNIN. THIE PRESSUPRE ON TEES IRISH ISANIKS. The accounts from the manufacturing districts -continue hopeful. As a matter of protection the Belfast banks, it is stated, must follow the lead of the great emporium of British finance, but beyond the extra coat of discount no further evil is likely to ensue. The trade report of the Ban)ner says:- " Cash accommodation is freely given to all legitimate traders; there has been no scarcity of money to meet every zequirement, and we feel gratified to note that "the fourth" passed over satisfactorily. Two failures have been announced, but they are nob of such a character as to cause any great shock to local commerce. From the muore distant towns and smaUer places of business in the north-east of Ulster our advices are all favourable,-payments continue good, and, though the state of trade Is inactive, confidence holds the bestplace in commnercial circles. Thetraffic on the several lines of railway has been fair for the week, and in the 'cross-Channel trade a large passenger trafic goep steadily on. The Glasgow boats have had the best season ever recollected and the Liverpool and Fleetwood have equal cause of satisfaction at the proceeds of goods and passengers receipts." And, again, rith regard to the state of the linen trade: "All the larger bleachfields in this and the next counties are in fuU work; the anrozmt of finished goods turned otxt during the last month Is the largest known in any foriner October. Sales cannot be reported as at all changAd for the better, except ia some few cases. The export to Newy York is as perfectly at a stand as if a regular blockade existed between Great Britain and the city on the Hudson. In the home market no large sales arebaingeffected; but it should be stated that for the nine months ending September the turnover in linens had been very extensive. The transactions in brown webs fail into small compass. Rarely have the sales been so low at any simUar period of previous seasons, and, while production runs up to a pretty large aggregate, the quantity of linen taken off by bleachers is small in the extreme. BaUymena market was dull on Saturday last, and conslderable lots of stock left in the hands of holders, Lurgan on Thursday was no lees inactive." The report of the Mfercury announces that all the large linen houses will be very slightly affected by the state of things existing in America - "F or the last six months, or we might say nine, our mnanufacturers have been exercising great caution, and limiting very much their operations. The consequence is that they are quite easy under a pressure which would have told fearfully upon them at the commencement of the year. If production be decreased stiUl further in the various departments of our llnen and cotton trade, as appears to be contemplated, there is no room hr the spprehension of any faiures whatever." According to the Nortlhern Whig the story of the criss has run through Ulster, and the conduct of numbers of the persons accustomed to deal with the banks has been absolutely frantic. One good story speaks volumes:- " A portly farmer, hurrying on a car from the railway station at wnich he had just arrived, droveup to one of our banks. E[e leaped from the ear, rushed up to the steps, dashed to tho counter, and demanded the whole ot h;s deposits-3001. or 4001. The clerk smiled, overhauled the books, deducted charges, and handed the money-in the ban's own notes-to the excited agriculturist. The farmer pocketed the notee, breathed a deep sdgh of comfort, and exclplIred joyously, 'Now, break assoon as you like; I've got my money.' That is just the insanity of ignorance which for the last few days has been influencing the whole province. There has been a run on the branches of the Belfast banks in several directions, and, of course, that is a great inconvenience, and necessitates much disarrangement. In Derry the run on that branch of the Belfast Bank was a perfect panic; and this may go on, unless every man in a position to give him influence strives to check the lunaoy. Let our country readers be assured that the Belfast Bank is a model establishment, conducted by profound financiers; that' it has for years paid enormous profits; that if it stopped to-morrow, Its proprietary, and not the public, would lose; and that when the Bank of En-land breaks the Belfast Bank will break, but not till then." THE TEA FRIAUDS AND TE BOARD OF CrSTOMS, The Bantner of Ulster has the following curious statement in reference to the frauds of the absconded tea-merchant and to the conduct of the local Board of Custcus:- "Yesterday the Customs held a farther investigation to ascertain the ownership of 219 chests of tea bondcd by J. J. Moore in his stores, Skipper-street, and subsequently removed to other stores. The jury, after a full investigation, found that they were the property of different traders in town, some of whom had commercial tranmactions with Moore. Had fuller notice been given of the investigation previously held it wor'd have afforded several merchants who are now complaining an opportunity of establishing their right to property now under reizure by the Customs. The cave is one which merits special consideration, affecting, as it does, the Custows and several of the most respectable merchants In Belfast. It is not Senerally known that several montbs ago a fraud was discovered by the offices of Customs prior to the time when the stock of teas in Moore's store was taken by them. When the stock was taken the officers did not pierce the chests, to discover whether they were filled with ten or brickbats. Two chests of tea were wanting, but who removed them was a mystery. An investigation might have discovered the guilty party, but no investigation took place. Instead of this, as we have been credibly informed, the duty was demandcd and a fine imposed, both of which Moore speedUy paid. We are not aware that any intimation of this irregularity was conveyed to the securities, to whom such a discovery was of so nmuch imnportance. He i it been known to them that a burglary had been committed, the probabLity is they uould have cancelled their securities. Moore would have lost his license, merchants would have obtaived their goods, and the Customs would bave escaped tlsh obloquy and inconvenience to which they havo been exposed. This 9as- but the begolniiof official blunders; others greater far soon succeeded. The security they received was one of these. Instead of insisting on a security whioh would covertho entirs of the goods bonded in Mc ore's stores, what did they do ? They received kalf the amount,-that is to say, 3,0001. instead of 6,0001. And what has been the consequence? They have been obliged to selze all the goods bonded in these storesto secute themselves against loss brought about by their own neglect ! Dutiable goods are generally bonded In 1he name of the merchants to whomn they belong; the loss and inconvenience in this case, therefore, must be very considerable. Whether the law will sanction such a seizure remains to be seen, and whether the Crown shall be made to pay deterioration and loss to the sufferers may be doubtful. One thing is manifest, that much evil has been created by the want of sufficient secarity having been originally taken by the proper authorities. It is true, when the fraud was fully known an investigation took place, witnesses were examined, peisons arrested, warrants issued, and a reward offered for the apprehension of the culprit-but all this came too late. Moore. who could have given every information necessary, was allowed to escape. Why was he not arrested on the day the fraud was discoverede Was he not seen at his office on that day ? Did he siot go to the Exchange, as he was accustomed, on the evening of the same day? Why, we ask, was he not arTested ? An effort was made after he had left, but not by the Customs. That effort was abortive, but if the Customs, backed by the Csown, had made energetic exertions on the Thursday night the culprit musthave beentaken, ashe did not getaway till next morning, It is reported he was in Lisburn, and left by' an early train for Dublin on the Friday succeeding the discovery of the fraud. There can be little doubt, too, that after It became known he sailed in the Asia, had the authorities ordered a vessel from Cork, armed with such power as they could give, the Asia would have ' stopped, lain to,' and delivered up to them the flying fugitive. But this they did not do. The Customs have not stopped with the seizure of the goods in the bonded store; they have removed all the property. Where? To another bonded store? No; but to the vaults of the new Custom-house, where they will be exposed to the danip exhalations which necessarly proceed fron, anewbuilding. Two evilsimayarise from this procedure-one, that of deteriorationiof the quality of the teas; the other, depreciation in price, which may take place during their detention. The merchants complain, and we think justly, that the seizure and detention of thelr goods are to them a serious pecuniary loss. They require them for the purposes of trade, but they cannot get temo The brand of tne broad arrow is on them, and no r.atter wfhat loss the merchants may sustain, there it must remain till the Custome please to release them. There is one way of cutting this Gordlan knot-that is, by a Government investlgation into the entire conduct of the Customs in this case,. twill be then seen whether or not the officials, from the colector down, have been guiltv of a great direliction of duty, and whetheir the respectabe merchants of our town are not extitled to compensation from the Crown for the great incenvenience and loss they have sustained by the alleged negligence and incompetency ofEtheir officials." The last Irish bank retumns show an increase in the circulation, as compared with the preceding returns, of 705,1651., making, with the increase of last month, an enlargement of the notes in the hands of the public of considerably upwards of a niUIion. This increase, large as it is, does not exceed that which uisually takes place at this period of the year. In 1850 the increase on the month was 8G0,0001.; in 1855 it was 890,0001.; and in 1854, 670,0001. During the next three months we may expect that the circulation will about mairtain its present level. There is ordinarily some increase in the issue in November, but at the present moment the banks wiU naturally pursue as cautious a course as poisible. In the coin held there is an increase on the month of 12,0001. The following figres will show the position of the banks In the aggregate now, and at the same period of the fSve preceding years:- bF'rom the foregoing returns it follows that the ILish banks are now 907,4651. above their fixed !issue, but, taldng into aOcount the coin they hold, ithe amount is 1,374,5651. below that allowed by law. The Bank of Ireland is still 200,0001. below I the authorized circulation. AUl the other banks are Iabove it. The amout of coi4 now held by the National Bank approaches very nearly to the sum in the hauds of the Bank of Ireland, the amounts respectively being 607,7921. and 673,095f. Following the courne of the Bank of England, the Bank of Ireland yesterday made an advance of 1. per cent. in the rate of discount. The terms of the Bank of Ireland are now as follows :-For Eiglish and Irish bills not having more than 95 days to run, 9 per cent. per annum; for Scotch bills, 9 per cent. per annum, together with a charge of 2s. 6d. per cent. English and Scotch bills having less than five days to run are taken at a comraission of 2s. 6d. per cent. in lieu of discount. Applications are received for advances on Government or Bank Stock at 9 per cent, per annun.
THE VJORZ7 TRADB. CO0N EXOHANGR, IARX-LA.E Nov. 9. Most of the country markets hold on Saturday were fairly supplied with wheat, in which a steady business waa doing, at very full to a slight advance in prlces. Barley, however moved off heavily, and the quotations had a downward ten dency. lt other kinds of produce verylittle was doing. The near continental markets continue heavy for wheat as well as spring corn. In the United States the export trade continues inactlve. The arrivals of English grain in the port of London last week were only mnoderate. From abroad we received 11,599 quarters of wheat- 5,407 barley, 42,121 oats, 434 beans, 2,175 peas, 3,000 linseed, 827 rapeseed, 142 mustardseed, 1,289 sundry seeds, 153 sacks and 2,841 barrels of flour. , The quantity of wheat received fresh up to our market coastwlse from Essex and YLent was only moderate. By land carriage the receipts were small, consequently the show of samples was limited. The bulk of the supply came to hand in fair condition, considering the damp state of the atmosphere. Although the attendance of both town and country millers was by no means numerous, there was a slight improvement inthe demand compared withMonday last, and that day's prices were supported. There was rather a large supply of foreign wheat on offer. Fine heavy parcels sold to a moderate extent at fuU priees. Inferior qualities met a dull inquiry, on former terms. Floating cargoes of grain off the coast were held at full quotations. We were weU supplied with both English and foreign barley. The trMde ruled heavy in the extreme, and some qualties were almoat unsaleable. Prices were nominally 2s. per quarter lower than last week. There was very little inquhr for nalt, at barely stationary prices. The show of oat samples was very extensive. Good sound qualities were held at fuU prices, but damp corn sold slowly at a decline in value of fully 6d. per quarter. Beans were in short supply and moderate request, on former terms. Owing to a large arrival from abroad peas sold heavily at Is. to 2s. less money. Flour was in moderate request, at last week's currency. CURUNT PR.IO1 OP BRITI8H GRIN AND OUR IN MARK-LAXF.

That the remarkable progrey of the arts and sciences, and the great extension of the field of learned research in recent times, combined with the introductio,n of an educational test into some of the higher departments of the public service, render it imperative that souae stepsabe taken to malke the systema of education in the Scottish Univer-sities in some degree coustuensurate with the wants of the age. 2. ThAt the recent aademical reforms itn Oxford and Cambridge al point in a direction thatniast tend seriously to affect the prosperity of the Scottish Universities, unless imxediate steps be taken to put these anstiutions in au oonditon to contend against the combined infl'ence of the ancient resources iad the ntew enerrty of the Englsoh Tin versities, 3.

RBEA CTION OP TEE A MERCAZI PANIC. (From the Newn York Tims.) The Europa at Halifax, from Liverpool Saturday, October 10, brings the first decided evidences of the financial etft )t in Europe of the money troubles on this side. The action of the Bank of England, without waiting for anythiug worse than was then received from New York-the lateso being by the Baltic to the 26th of September, the day of thePhiladelphia suspension-was to imimediately pixt up the rate of interebs to 6 per cent., and this upon an addition to the buUion reserve in the establishment of 618.0(jOl. It is possible orr Balifax despatch may have used the word increased instead of decreaeed in reporting this iten, bht it is sufficiently evident that the American panic was mainly the cause of the advance in the terms of discount. The political and finaucial complication in British India also had its infiuence with the Uourt of Directors, but not to the same extent, since the India troubles had rather diminished the export demand for silver, while the American difficulty was about to rever3e the ordinary course of gold. When the Baltic left New York on the 26th of SeptemLer it was known that the Philadelphia banks had stopped seaymnt. A confident tone as to the policy of our own anks was held in the papers and private letters which went out by this steamer, and exchange on England was quote2 105. to 1(7, irregular, and already discouraging to drawers a.ganst produce shipments. These low terms justifying shipments this w&y,. and the expEctatlon that the Noe York and Southern Banks would require aid in the shape of bullion to noye the grain and cotton crops with ease, while the Pennsylvania and other banks were in suspense, had prepared the En2gish money-market for early and direct specie draoghts from an unexpected quarter to a very considerable amount. The action of the Bank of England management, therefore, ought iot to cause snrprise. But the worst of the panic here was yet to be heard from. The New Yorlk packet succeeding the Baltic was the Persia of Wednesday, September 30. She arrived at Liverpool the morning the Europa left. Her news, which wes of a startUng character in regard to the further complication of oer exchanges, was not yet generaly kmowni in ondon, while in Liverpool, for the first time in very many weeks, the cotton trade was brought to a pause, and a decline in all qualities was being submitted to in nuticipation of accounts from this side still less favourable. 'hue rates of exchange on London reported out by the Persia were from par to 103 percent., with Increased diffilalty in negotiating ordinary commercial biUls on any terms. The circulars and letters were of a sombre cast, though still expressing no doubt of the ability of the New York banks to sustain themselves. It was not until the Arabia sailed hence on yesterday vieek that the protest of the New York and Erie and M7ichigan Central Roads, the assignment of the Illinois Central, and the suspension of aU the Neow York banks -were communicated. The last event afforded a temporary let-up, in the Elrropean exchange and the postscripts to the advices which went out may for a few days induce the expectation in London that no further aid in the way of bullion wiU be demauded. But this hope will soon be dissipated by the subesquent packets, by which a number ef additional mercantUe failures and extensions directly affecting the import trade and its remittances abroad were coumunicated, together with a reaction in exchange to almost the lowest point of previous depression. We must therefore prepare for corresponding bad news from England and France by the return opportunities. The leading London journals at the last dates were still under the impression that the panic here, being the effect in a large degree of mere fright, would pass over without serious damage. This feeling wlll not be entirely removed until the accounts of the disaster are brought directly home to the American houses in England, and to the Laneashire and Yorkshirb manufacturers, who have sent or sold goods to the United States. These parties will feel the pressure first through the failure or delay of their customers and agents on this side in covering the credits opened for them in Lordon. And the continued low ruling of exchange here will be the first index to the Bank of England and the private and joint-stock establishments in London that American colections are to result disastrously, and further sales of goods to this country almost embargoed until the storm passes over. A similar concern on the subject will be created on the Continent, where a large portion of the losses and suspended debt now making in New York and Philadelphia will faU heavily. WiUl the American houses in England be able to weatber the storm? The number that come strictly under this designation is not large, nor do we believe they are very much exposed, It is possible that one or two of them may be sesiouely embarrassed, and find the American profits of half adozen years engalfed by the losses or suspsndcd debt advised in the same number of weeks. Bet the opinion does not generally obtain here that any importan. concern accepting for the United States wiU be cairied down. The doubt, however, on the subject is just sufficient to make the intervening two or three weeks a period of pain,ful suspense to their friends and correspondenta Moatofour NewYork banking firms connected wl,h the Englishtradedotheir businecs with old English houses, known and reco,nized a, such at home, though from their long and 3ntimate identific3t3ea with the trade of the United States better known here as Anglo-American firms Of such are the Barings, Brown, Shipley aud Co., Dennid: toun and others. All these mnay feel the crids severely, but none of them, we believe, disastrously to their own high standzig and credit among the first merchants of England. The further fuancial effect on the other side is expected by many to be runous to the credi' of American stocks, par.icularly the railways in which English buyers have taken an interest. This sort of fear is aWays exaggerated in panic Eeasons among ourselves, whether originating in M ar troubles in Europe, or diplomatic or money troubles at homes. We regard 3t as pretty certain that the lenst of the concern to the English peoplo and money-market from the present state of things hero will be marnifested on this score Xhey Vill have been suficiently preared for the worst ruling of stock values on this side, and the only additional event likely to startle the holders of American securities of which they have yet to hear is the assignment of the Ilirois Central Company. And this will soon be accounted for by the extraordinary embargo upon all exchange negotialions, which drove the company to protest while holding credits to the aniount of 200,0001. on London, for which they could find no sale on any living terms. The effect which wll touch the English and continental people more nearly wvil be their mercantile losses, prospective as well as immediate. The embarrassment to their trade with this country, which is to reverse its ordinamy CoUTse and to bear heavily upon the London and Paris money-markets-producing at the same time serious mischief to the English and French manufacturersis that the raw material of cotton, which must be had from the United States, and foreign bread, which may be requxired from the same quarter, can no longer be wholly paid for in goods. The want of rotton, on the extreLmely low supply now in Europe, is absolute, and must be met, if need be, by a drain of gold. The counter-action, from the temporary su2pension of z single market in their export trade, on the Manchester interest wiU not be such as to diminish materially the necessity for liberal stocks of the raw staple, unless the le-Ading London journal greatly misrepresents the manifold resources of the " broad trade of the Biltish en:pire" in its manufactured products. But there will probably be a recompensing advantage to the trade, even in this, on the score of price, which must rule relatively cheap, if to be met by the embarrassing and reluctant process of remitting gold, on a dear money-market, from the other side.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Can It be the intention of the Government to dis. continue the issue of Exchequer-bills altogether? If it be not, I cannot conceive anything more foolish than to let them, in these times of pressure, go down to 20s. discount, rather than raise the rate of interest until they are abso. lutely compeUed to do so. Unless this be done they will most assuredly find considerable diffioulty irL renewing their March bills at any rate vhatever. I am. Sir. vour obedient q- - nt ONCE BIT. Nov. 9.

A HorsE BLowxS up Wvi GV6cPOwDER.-On Satutday evening, abaut 7 o'clock, a terrible explosion, fatal in it" consequences, occurred at the shop and house of Mr. James Moore, ohyli8t and druggist, Ince, near Wigan. lt appears that Mr. Moore was servng in the shop, when two lads came in to purchase tobacco, and having fiUed their pipes, asked for a light. He lit a piece of paper at the gas and handed it to them, and i is supposed th.t a spark from the paper must have faUen into some coUiers' bIsrting powder that was lying loose in the sbop, which at onoe exploded with a terriqc report, knocking out the front vaaU of the shop and the house adjoining, and considerably damaging the adjacent premises. One little girl, named Mary Jane aylor, about ten years of age, happened to be stand. ing at the shop-window at the time, aud she was kUled on tho spot, her body being dreadfully mangled. Another little girl, also named Taylor, had both her legs broken, and is so much insurEd that her life is despaired of. Air. Moore is himself very badly hurt, and irs. Moore, who was buried n the ruins, was promptly got out, and found to be severely njured, but not So much as to leo any fear of its terminating fatally with her. About five mlinutes before the acoidont, a group of about 20 children were standing ontsido ithe shop, and had the explosion happened then theocon- equeuces mig,ht have been still more terrible.-Man^1chesec,' iP101JGEINGc BY SrStAsI.-The Highl1and and Agri|cultural Society of Scotland this year offered a premium of 2004. for a steam plough which should satisfy certain conditions. The only plough that entered into competition was that of Yr. John Fowler, Cornhill, London, which was tried 'or Eeveral days both at Stirling and Edinburgh, but in one or two instances tho day's work was interru ted by aceidental derangements of the machinery. Mr. Fowler's plough consists of a steam engine stationed at one end of the ridge, and so far locomotive as to progrcss latitudinally with the work, and an anchor moveable m like manner at I he other extreme. Between these P. plough traverse the field longtudinaUy. It is of double construction so as to move either way, and is propelled and guided by an endless rope revolving on the cylinders of the engine and anchor. After much consideration the judges have awarded the premium to Mr. Fowler, considering that, though bissteama plough may not h9ve satisfied all the conditions laid down by the society, the quality and amount of the work performed bave been such as to entitle him to all the encouragement and support wlhich their award is calculated to
