STATE OF TRADE IN THE MUANFACURING DisTRICTS.-The accounts from some of the prindpal seats of the cotton and woollen manufactures are not very satisfactory. In Bolton and the surrounding district the trade is said to be becoming more and more depressed. Several cottoIl mils have commenced running short time, and the handloom weavers are suffering severely from want of em. ploymuent. In the union there has been an increase of 67 persons relieved; and the chairman stated there was every reason to fear that there would be a continuous increase for some time to come. Blackburn is also suffering severely from the pressure. Several mills have been closed, and others are now working short time, while the larger establishments are under notice for a curtaUment of the honrs of labour. The credit of the manufacturers in the distriothas been pretty weU sustained, though some of them have had to submit to heavy losses. In the district of Heywood, Bacup, and Roohdale the embarrassments of the trade are said to be every day increasing. Some of the mills are stopped, and others are working short time. Knots of idle operatives congregate about the publichonses, where there are recruiting parties, an; many of tbem are picked up for military service. At Whitworth the mill hand.3 are not makinz more than four days a-week. In Bacup and the valley of Rossendale distress among the operatives is becomin,- very apparent. At Bradford the crisis is beginning to pro.uce its fruit. A few days ago a sharebroker of maniy years' standing stopped payment, and an old and respectable wool merchant, MIr. William Martin, bas just succumbed to the pr6ssure. The trade of the town and district ceneraUy bas, howover, been so cautiously conducted of late that anything like a crash is not anticipated. At Preston short time is becoming the order of the day; one firm employing about 3,000 hands vworks only four days a-week, and next week another Is.r'e firm will reduce their hours of labour to a similar lmit. 'Wsth the exception of a few mills under contract the whole of the establishments In Preston are now working short time.

LONDON, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1857. At a late hour yesterday afternoon the commer. cial public received the news that the Bank Charter Act had been suspended. The Bank is thus allowed by Government to issue an excess of notes not defined in value, and a promise is given that a Bil of Indemnity will be introduced in the next session of Parliament to free the Bank from the consequences of its conduct, should it be necessary to take advantage of the permission of Government. On the merits of this step we will say but little. It may be consistent with the maxims of political economy to regulate the issue of notes during ordinary times, and thus to cheek rash speculation and the embarcation in businews of men destitute of capital, while when an actual dearth of money prevails the chief banking institution of the country may be allowed to extend its issue of notes under a public guarantee. But if such is to be the principle of our monetary system, the sooner it is embodied into a law the better. If the Bank is to exceed its legal insue of notes as often as its rate of discount is necessarily raised above a certain point, then an Act of Parlianent should establish the practice on sound and inteligible principles. The commercial interests of the country should, not be subjected to a system by which a law is obeyed as long as obedience is easy, and temporarily swept away as often as pressure or panic supervenes. The houses which in 1847 and in 1857 have stopped payment before the relaxation of the law may well complain that, while they have been crushed by the operation of the Bank Charter Act, others not more solvent or of higher standing than themselves have been saved by the suspension of it. Whether the Bank avails itself of the privilege accorded to it or not, the invasion of the law is the same, and those who, trusting to its inviolability, prudently suspended their payments now find themselves placed at a disadvantage in respect to those whom boldness or good fortune encouraged to hold on a day or two longer. We can well imagine that only the representation that great commercial calamities were about to take place has determined the Government to act so bold a part. How much they feel the importance of the step is proved by what we have now to announce-that it has been resolved to call Parliament together at once, in order to settle the questions raised by the present crisis, and to register for Ministers and the Bank Directors that indemnity for which they are obliged to appeal. A Council will, we understand, be held next Monday, at which, probably, Parliament will be summoned to meet at the end of 14 days. We may certainly prepare ourselves for a violent attack on the English monetary system as established by the Bank Act of 1844. All the theorists of aU the schools of currency wil be ready to pounce on what seems the carcass of a dead law. And, indeed, they Will have much that is plausible and not a little that is true on their side. The law is a fair weather law, a law for times of steady trading and easy credit; its provisions are like the pasteboard defences of the Chinese-strong to look at, painted with heavy masses of stone and guns of enormous power, but iu reality a weakness and a sham. Such will be the reasoning of the partisans of inconvertible paper or uncontrolled banks. The defenders of the existing system will, on the other hand, have to face the fact that the Act has been twice suspended in two successive panics. What be;ter proof, it would seem, that the law does not provide for that very condition of things in expectation of which it was framed? At this moment, when the pressure seems about to cease, when the Inia mutiny is broken and the American disasters drawing to a close, we have the Act which has been so often debated, so skilfully defendedA so unhesitatingly supported by com- mnercial men of all parties, which committees have declared perfect and the House of Commons sanctioned again and again, now for the second time set aside by the Government at the earnest supplication of the business community. Yet as to the retention of the present law we have not the slightest doubt. Its thorough Supporters say that it is perfect for all times and all circumstances, and that its present suspension is a weakness on the part of Government, generated by an insane panic on the part of the people. But even those who admit that a time may come when the Bank should be allowed to extend its issue may still uphold the Bank Charter Act as the general law of the landL They may fairly argue that the suspension allowed by the Government yesterday was to save the country from returning to a state of barter. Gold is the measure of values, and, as long as it bears a sufficient relation to the transactions of the country, men may be required to make their payments in it or in notes immediately convertible. But if from any sudden convulsion the metal falls short, is drawn away, and exhansted at any spot, it cannot be expected that all the businems at that spot is at once to cease. There remains money's worthland and houses, cotton and sugar, wines and tobacco. All that is wanted is to be able to express these in the currency, which is the general standarrd of value. Gold has vanished, but the country has the material wealth which wiJl bring it back again. AU is a question of a few months, perhaps of a few weeks. It may in such a caae be alloweed to the Government to come to the rescue of the nation, by allowing a corporation which has a quasi national character, and is ruled by nationally imposed lawsv to create fictitious standards of value, in the shape of bank-notes which have no metallic representatives. Such a proceeding, however, must be understood to be an extraordinary proceeding, in which the community for its own good allows a certain establishment to exceed the limits of safe and legitimate dealing. In fact, the country must be considered as becoming security for the redemption of the extended issue, or, ia other words, as itself issuing a quantity of paper money by its agent, the Bank, in order that the business of the country may be conducted during the temporary abstraction of the usual currency. It is, therefore, no proof of the failure of the Bank Act that at certain times its restrictions should be suspended. In fact, this extension of issue should be considered as something superadded to the ordinary conditions of the Bane's existence. The Act of 1844 was passed to con'rol the Bank, not to control the nation. Parliament decided, and we think wisely, that it would not In ordinary times trust one great corporation with the power of irsuing an unlimited number of notes. This proceeding is strictly in accordance with the regulations which control the isue of country banks and -which reEtrain London banks from having any issue at all. Whether the amount of surplus allowed to the Bank be sufficient for the ordinary purposes of commerce is, of course, a question for discussion, but the principle which establishes a restrici,ion of some kind has been accepted by the nation in its general course of legislation. It still, however, may be competent to the country to remedy any abnormal deficiency of the currency by an extraordinary issue, which the Bank may be empowered to make, not, as it were, on its own account, but on account of the nation, which may regulate the amount issued and dispose of whatever profits may accrue by the transaction. This seems to us to be the defence for such an interference of the Government as has just taken place. The suspension of the Bank Act has nothing akin to the system which allows American establishments to flood the country with paper representing only a small percentage of capital, or perhaps no capital at all. It is the extraordinary device rendered neceseary by an extraordinary conjuncture, and when the necessity ceases the relaxation may cease too. Stil the suspension of a positive law is a grave matter, and may well necessitate a speedy appeal to Parliament.
The capture of Delhi and the relief of Lucknow are exploits which challenge our national pride as weU as our national thanksgiving. In the heartfelt gratification experienced at the rescue of our countrymen the valour and conduct of our Generals and soldiers should not be forgotten. So protracted has been our suspense, and so inexpressible is the satisfaction now afforded, that we may be apt to overlook in such a beneficial result the military triumphs by which it was achieved. Such a course, however, would be eminently unjust to commanders who have displayed the noblest qualities of soldiership and to troops who have fought and conquered in the face of obstacles without exanmple. Every fresh incident related of the siege of Delhi tends to establish more conspicuously than before the rrduouis charactsr of the operations undertaken and of the difficulties presented to the besiegers. The entire British force before the city, even after the arrival of succour, from every avaiable quarter, did not amount to 5,000 men, and of these many had been exposed for the three months previous to all the fatigues of unremitting warfare. The proportions ordinarily considered desirable between a besieged and a besieging army were on this occasion inverted; for, instead of the latter being three times as strong as tbe former, itwas here the garrison which outnumbered its assailants, in the ratio of at least 4 to 1. Add to this that it repreE2nted the very pith and strength of the mutiny, and was sustained by the inexhaustible resources of a fortified arsenal and the defences of a populous city. The 15,000 or 20,000 troops within the walls of Delhi were not composed of stragglers from loose bodies of insurgents, or of rebels without organization or cohesion. They were the most desperate and the most disiplined of the mutineers-men who had marched off by battalions to the head-quarters of the revolt, and who were ready to fight to the death with the guilt of murder on their heads. Among them were thousands of trained artillerymen, and in the stores of the arsenal were guns and munitions in abundance. The assault itself showed the formidable nature of the opposition prepared. The heavy cannon of our' siege train could silence the 24-pounders on the ramparta, but it could do little to assist the troops in penetrating the place. The real resistance was exactly of that kind which has always proved most severe and most sanguinary, and, instead of being offered in the breach, was reserved for the narrow streets and strong edifices of the city. How stubbornly the fighting was maintained may be gathered from the simple facts that to win the whole place, street by street, cost us no less than a week from the first day of assault, and that on this day alone 1,239 officers and men out of an attacking force of 3,500 were either killed or wounded. Such results establish beyond dispute both the wisdom of those tacties by which the assault was delayed and the undaunted heroism with which it was executed at the earliest moment presenting a probability of success. The invincible fortitude of the garrison of Lucknow, and the intrepid resolution by which its relief was at laat accomplished, will bear a comparison with the most famous examples of history. Seldom, indeed; if ever, has a siege been-sustained on such terrible terms. The little band of Britons within the weak defences of the Residency were not holding out for a point of honour or a maxim of military punctilio. Theirs were no civilized or chivalrous enemies content to gain possession of the place, and ready to accord generous treatment after a brief discussion of conditions. What they fought for was not the right of marching out with colours flying, or retaining their side arnis, or preserving their baggage. They knew-knew fromevidence beforetheir eyesthat in the surging swarm of rebels around them every man was thirsting for their blood, and that the moment of their expiring strength, when at length it might come, would deliver them, their wives, and their children into the gripe of miscreants whose leas1 atrocity w;ould be murder. With this dreadful prospect incessantly before them, they endured to the very end, though how hiuman minds or mortal bodies could support such a 8train appears impossible to conceive. Day after day, week after week, month after month, the long looked for relief was delayed, prevented, intercepted, or driven back; and in its stead there arrived only the ghastly news of massacres and butcheries foreshadowing their own. When at last the Cawnpore column actually advanced to the rescue the work proved beyond its strength, and no wonder, for the road before it was nothing less than one continuous field of battle fifty miles long. Sti the heroic garrison held out, availing itself of every chance and resource which events permitted, and fortifying itself on its liLtle raft of safety, although the friendly sail had appeared in sight only to disappear again. At length the fatal moment was approaching, for the rebels had succeeded in undermining the weak defences of the place, and a few hours more would have blown into the air the slender cover of the garrison, and left our countrymen and countrywomen exposed to the diabolical barbarities of the fiends around them. Providentially, at this supreme moment the relief was approaching too. Undismayed by the aspect of a kingdom in arms against them, General HAVXLOoK and his comrades once more crossed the river to fight their way to Lucknow, and this time victoriously. They carried every hostile position by storm, hewed their passage through the rebel masses up to the very wa71s of the Residency, and snat-hed their countrymen from the indescribable horrors of their impending fate. For the whole work they had but 2,500 men, and of these onefifth were struck down in battle. In every shape, therefore, which war could take has the ascendancy of the British race been estalished. We have succeeded in capturing a strong position, and we have succeeded in defending a weak one. As besiegers at Delhi, as besieged at Lucknow, we have been equally triumpbant, while the advance of our column to the capital of insurgent Oude presents little less than a miracle of determination and courage. Be it remembered by all that these exploits have been achieved before the arrival of any reinforcements from England, and with those resources only which could be extemporized on the spot. We yesterday gave a recapitulation of the QuzEzs forces in Bengal, and the total showed only a strength of 24,960 men of all arms-Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and Engineers-up to the lasI days of October. But even this gives no adequate representation of the actual facts. In the computation are included three regiments-the 23d, the 82d, and the 93d-be1onging to the Chinese expedition, which are known, indeed, to have arrived at Calcutta before the end of last month, but which had not been despatched to the 'Upper Provinces when these successes were gained. No troops, in fact, had reached India from England, except those diverted from China, and of these only a single battalion-the 90th-had been in time to take part in the operations proceeding. The capture of Delhi was accomplished without the least assistance from any quarter, except the Punjab. The relief of Lucknow was achieved without any aid, except from the colonies and this opportune arrival of the 90th. Of the broad stream of reinforcements despatched in haste from this country not a single soldier had yet appeared. The remaining work will soon be done in India, but there is something for us to do at home. If ever there were successes of British troops in which Britons could sympathize, heart and soul, they are to be found in the victories now reported. Such triumphs are eminently those of the British people, for they are due to the essential power of British character. They have been won against enormous odds by that union of endurance, intrepidity, and determination which our countrymen know so well how to maintain. No one con think that enough has yet been done in recompense of such deeds. A Red Riband has been sent to Sir JoHN LAVwrENCE, and a small pension to General HAVELOCe, but the country will not be satisfied with such acknowledgments as these. We have to reward not only the defenders of our Indian empire and the deliverers of our countrymen, but the vindicators of our military renown. The events of the last six months have shown that the resources and aptitudes of British soldiers, properly handled, are second to none. The task of satisfaction will be easy with Generals WLTSON, HAvELOOK, and OuTRn, and with their subordinates, who, like Major VINCENT ElYRE, so ably seconded the operations of their superiors ; but it would be matter of deep regret if the deaths of Generals Nicnoisow and NE, in the very moment of victory, should interfere with the gratitude of the nation for their extraordinary services. To General NICHOLSON is due not only much of the pacifcation of the Punjab, not only the safe conduct of decisive reinforcements to the camp before Delhi, but the brilliant victory of Nujuffghur, which was the first step to the capture of the city. To General NELL we are indebted for the first successful advance from the Lower Provinces to the Nort'i-West, and for the most re3olute co-operation in all the proceedings attending the relief of Lucknow ; nor is it likely to be forgotten wibh what uncompromising vigour he expressed the sentiments of the country in his short command at Cawnpore. Our little armies in tbe East have done their duty with admirable fortitude, with unexampled success, but at hea vy cost, and it now devolves upon us to acknowledge by fitting and generous recompense the netional honour as well as the national advantages we have derived.

Some persons are always unlucky at eards, others are always meeting with accidents, spraining their ankles, fracturing their elbows, others are always ill-treated, others always lose in railway speculations or dabblings in the funds, others always fall in with the cholera or the plague when they travel, others are always getting into hot water, and others are always getting into the mud. There is a distinction between these two latter fatalities, though on a siiperficial view they might appear the same. There is a good sort of irritable, quarrelsome man that is alwaYs getting into scrapes from over-sensitiveness and too much suspicion, from the constant idea that people mean to insult him. But this sOrt of scrape is looked upon indulgently in society, and only excites a smile and the remark that poor Mr. ToucHy is in hot water again. But there is another sort of man, who is always getting not only into hot water, but into dirty water too. He is constantly getting into some scrape and eoming out of it very badly. He is always appearing to a disadvantage before the public, and something unpleasant sticks to him after every such demonstration. This repetition results in the impresaion on the public mind of an. adverse law or destiny, under the influence of which this individual acts. Certain names gather in this way an unfavourable and awkward history about them, as naturally as a mouldering cb&teau on the Apennines contracts legends of murder and poisoning, of ghost stories and mysterioes incarcerationj. The name of BERKMnEy, whether in connexion with FITZHARDINGE, or GRANTLEY, or CRAVEN, is associated in the public mind with a succession of discreditable family squabbles. The NAPIERS always turn up as injured men, maligned and conspired against, suffering from the ingratitude of Ministers or the public, deprived of their just rewards, and defrauded of the proper acknowledgment of their merits. Lord CARDiGAN has been in this sense an unlucky man. We do not wish to revive the details of a melancholy past, and therefore we shaU only allude here to a particular trial which brought Lord CARDIGAN's name before the public very early in his career. Then came various courts-martial, Then came the duel and aU the ominous and gloomy pomp anad grandeur of the law involved in the trial before the House of Lords which it evoked. A State trial in these days excites sensations somewhat akin to those which the appearance of a comet or an eclipse of the sun did in rude and early times, when this irregularity of nature shed disastrous twilight on half the nations, and perplexed monarchs with fear of change. A real State trial alarms a good many excellent people, whothink that things must be going wrong in the country when the law comes out invested with terrible majeaty and awful ceremonial; at the sound of Westminster-hall and the House of Lords their voices lower to a whisper, their looks betray indefinite apprehensions, and they gather close round the fireplace to console one another with the homeeopathic remedy of genial horrors, and soothing mysteries, unaccountable disappearances, startling coincidences, prophetic dreams, and vsitathons from the supernatural world. A pause sulcceeded the trial before the House of Lords, and the tide of fate appeared to be driven back, and an opportunity was afforded for a new turn of events and a new leaf of life. But, unfortunately, it was only a pause, ald mischievous fate was only watching for the next occasion when it could embroil his Lordship and trip up his heels. The Crimean campaign was admirably adapted to form a fresh start for a man' who had some unpleasant reminiscences sticking to him, which might be blotted out by active and meritorious service and the exhibition of gallant and patriotic soldiership. Here was, indeed, a golden opportunity, but, unfortunrtely, his Lordahip made but little use of it. No one will dispute his personal courage, but with all the a at which actual service on the field and exposure to danger justly procured for Lord CARDIGAN, the main result was not favourable to him. The Crimean campaign, the very instrument which he might have enlisted on his side, and by which he could have achieved a triumph over the past, turned agaiust him, and maliciously plunged him head over heels in the mud of the Chelsea Inquiry. What a disclosure of bickerings, suspieons, jealousies, and snarlings, bad enough between two fellow-officers, and still worse between two relations I And no sooner was the Chelsea Inquiry, with its accompanying noise and angry letters to the newspapers, over, than the L.AwRxE affair came on; and as soon as the old LAwIRE affair was over tbere was a new LAwRIm affair, the VICECHANCLLOR'S judgment upon which appeared in our columns yesterday. It appears that, with the singular faculty for development which belongs to every quarrel in which Lord CARDIGAN is concerned, the dispute with Major LAWRIE, which was decided by the CrEr EBARON more than a year ago, passed immediately from the pecuniary ground to a ground of honour, end broke out afresh, like an obstinate sore that refuses to be healed, issuing in a new eruption of charges and recriminations in connexion with the point of publishing private correspondence. Lord CARDIGA?'s lawyer, before the first trial, wrote to a certain Mr. HAYwARD for somne private letters of MIajor LAwRI;, with a view to their use at that trial. Major LAWRIE wzites an angry letter to Lord CARDIGAN on the subject, threatening him with a retaliation in case this is done-the publication of the private letters from Lord CARnIGAN to himself during the Crimean campaign, the office r who were reflected upon in them having been previously consulted. Lord CARDIGAN replies by diEowning his lawyer's act, and Major LAwRIE, in return, abandons aU1 idea of publication on his side. Here, then, the affair would naturally rest, but Lord CARDIGAN will not let it. After this quarrel about the publication of private correspondence is over, and the whole trial with which it is connected is over, there is a fresh start. Lord CARDIGAN cannot control his destiny; he gives vent to reflections upon Major LAwRIX in the Clubs, which Major LAWRIF meets by a second threat of publication, only modifying his threat this tine by the salvo that anything strictly private and confidential shaU be omitted, and that only be published which is necemsary for the vindication of his own character. L. ord CARDIGAN asked for and obtained an injunction in the courts last term against this publication, which injunction was dissolved by the Vice-Chancellor WOOD on W'ednesday. What an unfortunate destiny for a man, especially a man b'=rn for distinction, splendour, and reputation, and endowed with every gift of fortune -trials, duels, trials again, courts-martial, inquiries, more trials ! What an atmosphere to live in,whether by fate or by choice, or both I W'hat wheel of IxION is itito which the noble Lori and gallant seldier is fastened, which rolls him along from quarrel to quarrel, and from one court to anotlier court? Cannot he make a vigorous effort to dispel the evil charm which is upon him, break the bond of destiny, and begin to live like a useful, sensible, and respectable man ?

THE GOVERNMEBNT AND THE BANK OF BNGL.AND. The following letter was addressed yesterday afternoon to the Governors of the Bank of England:- "Downing-street, Nov. 12. Gentlenen,-Her Majesty's Government have observed with great concern the serious consequences which have ensued from the recentfailure of certain joint-stock banks in England and Scotland, as well as of certain large mercantile firms, chiefly connected with the American trade. " The discredit and distrust which have resulted from these events, and the withdrawal of a large amount of the paper circulation authorized by the existing Bank Acts, appear to Her Majesty's Government to render it necessary for them to inform the Bank of England that if they should be unable in the present emergency to meet the demands for discounts and advances upon approved securities without exceeding the limits of their circulation prescribed by the Act of 1844, the Government will be prepared to propose to Parliament upon its meeting a Bill of Indemnity for any excess so issued. " In order to prevent this temporary relaxation of the law being extended beyond the actual neces sities of the occasion, Her Majesty's Government are of opinion that the Bank terms of diecoont should not be reduced below their present rate. " Her Majesty's Government reserve for future consideration the appropriation of any profit which may arise upon issues in excess of the statutory amount. "1 Her Majesty's Government are fully impressed with the importance of maintaining the letter of the law, even in a time of considerable mercantile difficulty, but they believe that for the removal of apprehensions which have checked the course of monetary transactions such a measure as is now contemplated has become necessary, and they rely upon the discretion and prudence of the directors for confining its operation within the strict limits of the exigencies of the case. " We have, &c., "PALMERSTON. "G. C. LEWIS. "To the Governor and Doputy-GoTernor of the Bank of England."
HANOVRR-SQUABE ROOMS. The conijring of modernJtimes was never so closely ass mllated to the magic we read of in the legends of Faustus, and snch liLe specimens of wonder,ul lHseratare, as bfa new jprofessor rejoicing in the outlandish name of Wihalba Frikell, who, having performed before nearly aU the fliglnesses mentioned in the Gotha Almanac, deigned last night for the firt time to entertain the general British public in the Harover-square Rooms. Sensible of the honour thus conferred upon it, the public mustered extremely strong, and wus, moreover, a very fashionable and brilliant public. Ietus add, that itwas most graciously received. Instead of a miserable mn, mournfully thramsuing an ineffective piano, a whole band had been engaged for its recreation during the intervals of conjuring. Your modern Mguas generally seeks to dazzle the senses by the gorgeousness and glitter of his apparatus. If he lorrowa a sixpence for sorne miraculons purpose he plunges It into a golden vase two feet deep; he encaes a cotton pocket-handkerchief in a caket of silver. Bet when the dust tbus thrown into the eyes-golddust thou'h It be-ceases to affcct the judgment, the spectator, quietly reflecting on an evening faU of prodigies, wil begin to fancy that if he had a collection of vast boxes, bottles, and goblets, all armed with doable bottoms, he might be able to transform a penny into a guineapig or a watch into a canary bird as well as the Merlin who has operated so strongly on his organs of veneration. Now, it is the peculiarity of Professor Wiljalba Frikell that he does not use any apparatus at all. His rising curtain, instead of displaying shelves piled with the magnificent girueracks of nineteenth-century magic, reveals naothing but a table and a couple of chairLs A hat borrowed from a visitor will yield 120 silver goblets at his command, wil b- ^onre wbole after utter demolition, with. out any otber envelope than a sheet of the oarsest brown paper, and, thus restored, will deliberateiv float up to the ceing, and there remain fixed till it Is suminoned down by the voice of the Professor. From a handkerchief obtained under slmilar circumstances plumes of ostrich feathers will arise sr,ucient to stuff tle Be of Ware. An egg and a lemon are both exhibited,withoutanymysterious adjuncts, and ina tr5ce tle egg is goneu to reappear when the peel is removed from the frait as its embedded core. In a word, Professor Frikells tricks are none of tbem mechanical, but are al performed by legerdemain in the strlct sense of the term. A great deal of conjuring has been seen in this metropolis, but such a combination of astounding results with means apparently simple is altogether new to the London Dublic.
SUSPECTZD BOBBRBRYdand MUpBjBR of aFA12MBR. On Wodnesday an adjoarnd Inquest was held at Leigh, ne r Manchester, by Mr. W. S. Rutter, one of the coroners for the county of Lancaster, on the body of John Hampson, a farmer at Stonehouse, near Tyldesley, aged 37, who had died from drowning on Sunday last. A suspicion was generally entertained in the neighbourhood that the deceased had been pushed into the canal by some boatmen for the purpose of being robbed of betweern 5Z and 61. in money in his posses3son, and was drowned by them; and the case excited Tory considerable interest. About nine witnesees were examined, from whose evidence it appears that the deceased left home on Sunday morning vith a nephew, who accompanied him as far as Astley-bridge. This nephew, a boy, left him at the house, of Mmrs Sarah Young, who was an aunt of deceased. He arrived there about 11 olock in the morning and asked for some liquor, but as he was then somewhat intoxicated the auntrefased to give hitm any, and persuaded him to drink some buttermilk instead. He offored Mrs. Young 2s. which he said he owed her, but it was declined. In offering this money he took from his pocket about 20a. in silver, and it was believed he left home with about six sovereigns in his possesdon. Mrsm Young watched him from the door nearly as far as the bridge over the Bridgewater Canal atAatley, and then saw him no more. Heihadremained at her house about half-an-hour, and afterwards went on board one of two empty coal-boats that were proceeding Ji the direction of Leigh. These boats were attached together, and drawn by a horse. About 1 o'clock he was seen at the Bull's Head publichonso, Buttsbridge, Bedford, about two miles from Astley-green. He went into the house ccompanied by sx or seven boatmen. The landlord there thought he was sober at the time, and filled four quarts of beer for him and his companions, which deceased paid for. A man named John Chapman, from Wigan, was one of the boatmen with him, and invited him to go forward with the boats to Wigan. He took with him a half-pint bottle of gin from this house, and returned with the bostmen to the boats, after staying only about 20 minutes. Aboat 2 o'dock he was seen by William Richardson, a dealer in hay, as the boats passed under the canal bridge at Leigh. He was at that time standing up in the hold of the second boat, but one of the boatmen assisted hlm to get on deck, where he lay down about a couple of minutes, when he was assistod to got into the foremost boat. Richardson, who was walking on the towing-path in the same direction the boats were going, seeing deceased was drunk, ran alongside the first boat and hailed the men in charge, saying, "Chaps, I know that man, he comes from the other side of Bongs (meaning Tyldesley Banks); let him get off and go home," One of the men in the boat, John uhapmsn, replied, "If thou touches this fellow, ru puach thy - head off." Richardson said, "It does not matter to me, but if I were you I would let hiiu go home." Chapman replied, "If throu says another word l'll punch thy -head off and stick thee into the cut (canal)." Richardson interfered no further, but walked a head of the beats. As he passed the driver of the horse the latter cautioned him against Chapman, saying, " Yon boatman has beaten one chap to-day-he is a terrible fellow for fighting." The driver told him also that the farmer had got a bottle of whisky, and had showi them five or six sovereigns. Richardson went on faster than the boats, and when he reached Diggles' pierhead, he heard the sound of a plunge in the water bahind The first boat was under Worsley's bridge 200 yards behind, and he went back about half this distance to see what had taken plac He did not then see the deceased, but heard one of the boatmen say, "Bring the - up this way." He then resumed his journey to Leigh, about a mile fnrther. Richard Morgan, a shoemaker at L4gh, was near the canal when the boatg passed under Worsley's bridge, and heard the plunge. On looldug at the boats he saw one of the mun upon it stooping, as if to reach something out of the water, and two other boatmen were on the'towing path, stooping as if to reach something out of the water; and on approaching them he saw them raise a man out of the water with diflicolty. When they had him on the bank another man came from one of the boats, andsaid he was a man of feeling, and would not see any poor creature hurt. The man taken from the canal was deceased, and tho one who came up last said he would take him into the boat again, and undress and put him into a warm bed. Deceased was breathing, but with difficulty at that time, and frothed at the nostrils They took him into the boat and laid him down on the top of thecabin. On the arrival of the boats at Leigh he was still lying on the cabin, but dead, and one of the boatmen gave notice to a policeman, saying the man had rolled off the boat into the canal while in a staee of intoxication. A surgoon was sent for, but too late so render aid, and on a post mortem examination said he believed the deceased had died from drowntng. No money was found in deceased's pockets. This was all the evidence that coald be obtained, and The jury, after some consultation, determined upon returning an open verdict-" Died from the effects of drowning," so as not to prejudice any further investigation that may be instituted. A Cabinet Council was held yesterday at the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury inDowning-street.

MONEY-MARKTandCIYINTELL±ayUE Thursay Evening. The Bank Charter Act is abrogated. Ith fate at the second time of trial has been the same as at the first. The English Governmont have resorted to the notification that the Bank are authorized to extend their iuues on approved securities without regard to the amount of bullion in their vaults, at a rate of not less than I0 per cent. Although the announcement will give immense relief from fears which were rapidly spreading, there can scarcely be an Englishman who will not receive it with deep regret from the humiliation it involve. It must have resulted from one of two causes. either blind fright or an inherently unhealthy con. dition of business which prevented our merchanta from sustaining themselves against a rate of discount such as is borne at Paris, Hamburg, and X number of other centres of commerce. In either case the conclusion is equally lowering to our fame as a mercantile nation. It is satisfactory to believe that the measure was neither asked for nor recommended by the Directors of the Bank of England, or any delegated representatives of the leading mercantile or banking firms. At the same time, in justice to the Government it must be admitted that the period had obviouely arrived then protective steps of some kind had become absolutely necesaary. The position of the Bank of England and the private banks was never one of higher confidence, but the apprehension was evident on all sides that a withdrawal of deposits from the discount houses and joint-stock banks might commence at any instant and totally cripple their power to continue further accommodation; that the Bank of England, from the point to which their reserve has been brought by the sudden sweeping away of nearly two millions of gold for Ireland and Scotland, could in such case afford no adequate help, and consequently that if a resistless panic was not to be considered as having actually commenced, we were in a position in which no one could calculate on itb being kept off even for a single hour. But there were remedies available other than that of breaking and destroying the law-for a law which has been contemned on each occasion of trial must be looked upon as destroyed. The* state to which we had come had not been brought about by any fault of the Government or of the comrmunity at large, and it was for those who had occasioned it to find their own means of extrication. They did not look about for those means, because they knew they could obtain relief elsewhere. If this conviction had not animated them they would long before the present week have concerted measures of defence. The whole history of our situation is plain. For years past ce:tain provincial jointstock banks have gambled to an incredible amount by means of wbat are termed re-discounts-that is, with a limited capital they have granted accommodation to an almost unlimited extent, sending the larger proportion of the bills thus negotiated to the discount establishments in London, who, in turn, discount them for the joint-stock banken the strength chiefly of the endorsement of such bank, and not upon any careful atimate of the responsibility of the drawers or acceptors, or the legitimate character of the transactions they represent. " Of courme we are safe with the endorsement of the Liverpool Borough Bank" is the cry. " The character of its business may be doubtful, but its shareholders are all liable to their last farthing." Again, " Why should we hesitate with the We,ter Bank of Scotland ? Among its proprietary are two or three names which are alone good for as many millions." But how is the money obtained which is thus freely granted by the London houses ? The security relied upon is the ultimate responsibility of a certain number of shareholders scattered over a large district, and which, so far from having anything in common with a sound banking security, is wholly unavailable in emergencies, and can never be realized except through protracted legal processes; but the money advanced consists of deposits lodged for the most part at caU with the discount houses, or at notice ranging perhaps to a month with the jointstock banks. Here, then, is a deliberate breach of every recognized banking principle, and it i5 one that on each occasion of trouble has led to the same results. The London money-dealers cannot have been insensible to the peril; but their practiee is to carry on the system until its inevitable consequences develope themselves, and then to seek safety by catting off " facilities" and throwing the applicants upon the Bank of England. Then we hase deputations to the Governors, threats that if something is not done the whole trade of the country will be brought to a stand, and an outcry, of course Bucessful after the requisite amount of alarm has been created, for the suspension of the Bank Charter Act. If, however, the example of 1847 had never been set, and these persons had been taught to feel that, happen what might, the laws of the countryin the full knowledge of which they had uudertaken all their operations-would be rigidly kept inviolata, not only would the public never have been disturbed by predictions of coming ruin, but every safeguard that ingenuity could devise would have been Eecretly prepared to provide for any casualty. If the discount-houses and any of the joint-stock banks apprehended a withdrawal of their deposits to an extent to cause public inconvenience, it was their business to maL-e common cause to guirantee each other's eafety, and, if any nominal or contingent suspension were necessary, to bear the discredit of it themselves, and not to inflict it on the Bank of England and the country. They could have announced to the public that a run being threatened they had combined to maitigate its consequences; that, not being able to foresee its possible extent, they had agreed to suspend for the moment any return of deposits, and that to meet the difficulty they would issue their promissory notes at three months bearing nine per cent. interest, and secured by their common liability. A meeting of all the principal bankers and merchants, including the Governors and Directors of the Baak of England, might have expressed approval of the wisdom of their course, and before a few weeks had passed these notes would have been at a premium. But, unquestionably, the character of the issuers would have been damaged, since the fact of their having been oonged to resort to such a method would have fixed them in their right position in relation to the caunes that had led to it. If any chracter was to be damaged, it was much more pleasant that it should be that of the Bank of England, the country, and the Government, and, thanks to the complaisance of the latter, they Fave succeeded in putting it on that footing. To be sure they took care that matters should go to a point at which the Cabinet would have little choice. There was, however, an alternative which, although equally unjust in being an act of Government relief for which there was no true claim, would gtill have prevented a sacrifice of principle. An issue of one-pound notes could have been adopted without any infringement of the doctrines on which the Bank Charter Act i3 grounded. The fact that the permission for the circulation of such notes terminated in 1829 is not material, as the law could have been set aside on one point as easily as on another. This plan, however, seems not even to have been considered. After ten years' experience, therefore, and all the enlightenment that was thought to have been attained, we have beeh thrown back at once to the discreditable positioa we.ocoupi&j in the last crisis, and all the &dMirablW conduct of the Bank of England and of the respeotable Mercantile public has been rewarded by a pro- clam.atiom to every speouivitg or receUm money'
TilE CRISIS. LIVBRPOOL, THURSDAY. Shortly before 4 o'clock this afternoon a rumour became current on 'Change and apread like wildfire in every direction, that the Bank of England had been authorized by Government to suspend its Aot. In place of features of the most gloomy despondency and forebodings all is now exhilaration, and the panic is generally beleved to be at an end. The intelligence was first received by private telegram sent over the wires of the Electric and Internatioual Company, those of the British and Magnetic Company having been cut. EDINBURGH, WxDES DAY EvmrznG. Though Edinburgh is not, strictly speaking, a commercial city, and will suffer comparatively little from the recent diEastrous failures, it has at least participated considerably in the excitement and alarm of the present crisis. The umfortunate resolution, not to say miBtake, on the part of the other banks in refusing to afford sufficient aid to the Western Bank of Scotland, notwithstanding its notoriouisly solvent proprietary, has produced a panic affecting more or less all of them, and haa given no inconsiderable blow to the confidence of the community of Scotland generally in its banking system. A run has been made, more or less strenuous, on almost every bank of this city, and on some the pressure has been tremendous. The panic has unfortunately concided with the term of Martinmas, which took place to-day, and which is one of the two half-yearly periods of payment throughout Scotland. Large sums of money are usually paid away by the banks at tbis term, a reflux immediately following; but on this occasion not only had the banks the usual payments to meet, but hundreds of depositors in no need of the cash, and acting under the impulee of panic, ran to the bank to demand all their money instantly, and in gold, while the usual replacements were made in very stinted measure. Even the notes of the old chartered banks and of the Bank of England itself were refused in many cases, the clamour being everywhere for gold. The Union Bank sustained to-day a very severe pressure, but, having fortified itself by a large supply of specie from London, it was able to meet all demands with alacrity, though in many cases being called on to tender the sovereigns by hundreds. The Edinburgh branch of the City of Glasgorw and its saviDgs-bank sub-office, however, had to saccumb about 12 o'clock and ¢lose their doors, to which the following notice was affixed: "In consequence of the excessive demand for gold at the head-office and branches the directors have deemed it prudent to suspend payment for the present, with the view of res uming shortly." This bank had certainly been one of the severest sueferers from the panic, a run having been made upon it, both here and in Glasgow, all yesterday, not a few Glasgow depositors who had been unable to obtain access to the office there yesterday having come to Edinburgh this morning to seek their money here. At thesub-office allthemorning there wasa great crowd of the smaller depositors, and a zevere crushing and squeezing took place about the doors. One unusual drawback to those doing business to-day was the almost invariable refusal of the banks to cash any but their own rotes, and the inconvenience was further heightened by the refusal of many individuals to accept the notes of any of the banks having connexions in Glasgow. Or the other hand, however, several shops had placards in their windows, offering full value to purchasers for Western or any other notes. In connexion with the panic may be mentioned the departure from Edinburgh Castle yesterday evening of seven officers and 220 men of the Ride Brigade to strengthen the present very weak garrison in Glasgow. To-day a detachment of Lancers left Peirshill barracks here for Hamilton, to reinforce the troop lying there, and to be within hail of Glasgow if required.
SUICIDF AND ATURiPTD MURDER.-A man named Henry Featherstone had been for the last five years and a-balf in the employ of Mr. Passmore, a farmer at East Down, near Barnastaple, North Devon, as farm servant, and was always considered a mild, inoffensive man. A short time back, however, irom some unexplained cause, Featherstone imbibed a notion that two of the female domestics had entertained opinions and manifested foelings of an unkind cbaracter towards bun. So impressed was he with this idea that, without any notice whatever, he sought an interview with his employer, intimating that he intended to quit his service, and demanded payment of the wages then due to hiui Mr. Passmore inquired the reason of the dete-mination to which he had so strangely arrived, and Featherstone replied that the women had treated him badly and he would no longer a-socelate with them. Mr. Passmore, after some rewonstrance, paid him 321. 2s., and Featherstone left the premises. Subsequently, while the housekeeper aud anovher woman were sitting quietly at work in the kitchen, they were fearful!y alarmed at hearing the report of firearms from the outside of the house, foilowed by the breakihg of the windows of the room in which they were te,ted, and simultaneously a number of shots flew aboat them in all directions. They screamed aloud for assistance, when ltr. Passmore and some friends whom he was entertaining, who had heard the report, rushed Gat with lights into the garden. They made a minute search, but were unable to discover any one. They found, however, a jacket, which was at once recognized as having belonged to Featherstone, and in the pockets oZ which were some loase shots, gunpowder, and a box of percussion caps. Suspicion immediately fixed itself upon Featherstone, who was known to entertain a feeling of hatred toward the two women, and a most active search was'instituted without delay; nothing, however, was heard of him. On the following day a further and more rigid searoh was made in the garden, when a large horse pistol was found outside the window, apparently dropped just where fired. The police were made acquainted with the circumstances, and means were taken to aDprebend Featherstone. Their efforts were ineffectual, bub as Mr. Tamlyn, a gentleman residing in the neighbourhood, was amusing him. self shooting rabbits in Knowle-wood, he discovered the body of a ,uan suspended by a piece of new rope from a branch of an oak tree. He could not see his face, as a "comforter" had been drawn, cap-like, over it. He gave au alarm (having first ascertained that the man was dead) and the deceased rwas cut down. The " comforter" being removed the deceased was identified as Fsatherstone. At the Inquest the above facts were deposed to, and in addition it was proved that the deceased had purchased the pistol and ammunition on the day before the atcnmpt at murder was made from Mr. Frayne, of Barnstaple, and among his effects six 51.-notes vwere discovered. A verdict of insanity was returned,-Dorset County C7hronicl. CRYSTAL PALACE.-ONE SITTLTNG DAY, Thursday, Nov. 12-Admissious on payment, 1,56l; ditto by beas tickets, 366; total viators, 1,927,

Rathbone, chairman of the bank, in the chair, "Present-100 persons holding 37,924 shares, and proxies were handed in for 37 persons holding 22,021 sharee, The minutes of the proceedings at the general meeting, held on the 10th Inst, were read and confirmed. The Chairman mentioned that it vwas deemed expedient to call another general meeting of the shareholders for the 24th inst., principally for the formal adoption and con- irmation of the proceedings of this day, and that notice of such meeting wrould be issued this :veniing. "The directors presented the following report to the shareholders, which was read :- "' Report of the Directors to the Meeting of Shareholders of the Liverpool Borough Bank, held at the bank on the 12th of November, 1857. " ' Gentlemen,-Since the last report to the shareholders at their annual meeting in July it became apparent to the directors that the position of the bank in respect to losses incurred and capital locked up and unavailable rendered it impossible to carry on the bank, except at the risk of being suddenly stopped by a run that might at any time ensue from the disclosure of these losses, even if the constant dr&An on its resources which seemed to have set in did not compel its suspensioni within a short period. It was there- fore decided that it would be the wisest cour-A to seek as-ist- I ance in London. The state of the money-market made it extremely difficult to obtain this assistanoe, and the bank, after various prtraoted negotiations, failed to secure it in time to prevn the necessity of closing its doors at the moment when its efforts seemed to be successfuL. "1' It then became the duty of the directors to place themselves in such a position as would satisfy the shareholders, the creditors, and the public that they were doing everything that could be done for the interests of alI concerned. Under the able advioe of Mr. Field, whom they summoned from London to their assistance, they called together a la-go number of shareholders not previously connected with the management of the bank to assist the directors by their advice and sanction in all the steps nece.sary and ad,isable to be taken. The chairman of the committee then formed by these shareholders will inform you more particularly of its proceedings, and the directors would only briefly state that it -was further deewed desirable, under the advice of Mr. Field, to summon a meeting of the depoeitors, who elected a committee, with which the directors and the Committee of Shareholders have since been in communication. "1' Mr. Braucker, chairman of the Committee of Shareholders, and Mr. Dixon, one of the managing directors, were deputed to go to London and open negotiations with the billbrokers there; the result is that the London billholders and a large proportion of the depositors have agreed to accept the terms of payment proposed by the bank, viz. in instalments of 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, with 7 per cent. interest; and there is every prospect that the remnainder of the depositors and the few otber billholders who have yet to be communicated with wlll fall iniwith the terms which so large a majority have already in this short space of time so readily acceded to. "To provide against the possibility of angry feelings exciting shareholders and creditors to a course of action which, though natural in its motives, might lead to results exceedingly detrimental to the interests of all concerned, creditors as well as shareholders, the directors adopted the suggestion of appointing mediators, who might step in to calm irrita. tioui, and to point out the absolute necessity of all parties,shareholders, directors, and officers of the bank-uniting in one general effort of cordial co-operation to make such a settle-nent with the creditors of the bank as would be maost conducive to the interests of shareholders, whose forboarance in seeking the fullest information that can be lafforded i- only desired in so far and so long as the exercise of it is absolutely necessary for their own interests. "' Mr. George Elolt, Mr. James Robinson, Mr. Edward Moon,i and Mr. James Aikin have kindly consented to accept the office of mediators, and the directors have only to express the wish that their klndness in so accepting an onerous duty for the sake of the good results to the welaare of aU connected with the bank may be reciprocated as it deserves by the determination to make the call for their good offices as little needed as possible. g With reference to the pecuniary position of the bank the directors have to state that more than one-fourth of the capital is gone,-an amount whioh under the deed renders it imperative upoa them to give the shareholders the option of vinding up the. ffairs of the bank, and that three-fourths of the capital is so locked up as to be at present unavailable for bankirgpurposes. These are the only two points that it is essenrit to state as far as regards the objects of the present meesing. " ' With reference to the general affairs of the bankL the directors need hardly state that it is at all times extremely diffdiult to arrive at conclusions that wilf convey reliable impressions as to the probable results of the winding up of matters livolving such very large amounts, especiall; at a time r hen the varying aspect of the money-market snd the oocurrence of unexpected commercial difiioulties of unexampled intensity bring new elementa of embarrassment into play. They consider, however, that they have ground to hope that a portion of the orpital may be preserved; the amourt so preserved wil mainly depend upon the good management and judicious nursing of assets, which the arrangement now proposed wiUl enable those gentlemen to exercise who are about to take charge of the bank's affairs. "'The resolations which will be submitted for your adoption have for their object the voluntary winding up of the bank under and in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1857, which was framed with the intention of leaving the conduct of affairs in the hands of shareholders themselves, subject only to the interference of the Court of Chancery when it Is required to compel an inconsiderable minority of shareholders or creditors to yield to the wishes of a majority, and to arm the company with sufficient power to enforce on reluctant shareholders a compliance with Ills made on them in order to enable the bank to discharge its liabilities. " ' The directors are happy to inform you that the registration of the company resolved on last Tuesday is now completed. 'Havingthus laidbeforeyou a statement of the proceed. ings of the directors with reference to the circumstances which have given rise to this meeting, and having indicated the steps proposed to you in the present posture of affair, the directors bg to refer you to what wvill be stated by Mx. Braucker, the chairman of the Committee of Shareholdes and to wrhat Mr. Harmood Barner may wish to say. es "'WM. RPTA BOT E, Chairman Liverpool Borough Bank, Liverpool, Nov. 12."' Mr. J. B. Braneker, chairman of the Shareholders' Commlttee, then presented the following report on behalf of that committee, which was read "The Committee of Shareholders of the Liverpool B orouzhlank,informaUy appointed,no doubt, but presenting at the timne, as has been since eminently proved, the instrument most ready at hand, under all circumstances, best calculated to aid the directors in deciding on such measures as the urgeny of the circumstances required, beg to present thefollwina report: "' After agreeing on a recommendation to the directors to convene a meeting of the shareholders, the committee prooeeded to take into consideration the best mode of approaching the creditois of the bank, in which consideration two points of vital importance were involved, the one being the probable successive periods at whieh assets might be expected to bh realized, so as to base thereou some definite proposal, the other as to how long it could reasonably be expected that the creditors of the bank would consent to defer the settlement of their claims, " ' After mature deliberation it was decided to recommend the payment in cash of all deposits under 2X)I. so soon as the directors should be in a position to do so, and to offer to all the olser creditors of the bank alike the bank's promissory notes at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months' date, with interest at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum. Onerous as this latter coadition may appaar, it was only with great difficulty that a large and influential portion of the creditors could be brought to give their assent to it. That difficulty having, however, been overcome, and a large number repre. senting in amount nearly three-fourths of the whole having now acceded to the tropositions, it may be fairly assumed that they bear upon them the stamp of reasonablenees, both in respect of the creditors and of the shareholders. "I It is further hoped tsat the unanimity exhibited at the mcting of Tuesday and the determination evinced to proceed with the liquidation of the bank-s affairs in the best;possible mauner will not be without its effect in influencing such creditors as have not yet assented to come into the arrangement. " ' The Sub-Committee of the Shareholders' Committee havng had a somewhat more intimate access to the bank's affairs, it may be expected that this report should contain some alUlsion thereto. " ' So far as the shortness of the time they have been able to devote to the inquiry and their previous utter ignorance as to the real state of the accounts will admit of their ar- riving at any conclusion wbatever, they venture to exnress their opinton that of not only the original capital of the bank, but also of the assets held by them, a considerable portion is so loked up in various kinds of securities that much time, great forbearance, ard good management will be requiredtoinsure their advantageous realzation, and that upon the due combination of these several elements will mainly depend the eventual result as regards the original capital of the bank. " ' Such being the case, and the bank being about to issue its obligations to its creditors, as before stated, it becomes imperative on the Shareholders' Committee, in order to insure the puncbual fulfilment of those obligations, to recommend to the directors to make a call on the shareholdes indeed, this condition had been already insisted on by the creditors. "They trust, however, that the dates for its payment may be so arranged as that, while securing the object which renders it necessary, it may be made to press with as little severity as possible on the shareholders. " ' The meeting of Tuesday having passed a resolution to place the comspany under the Joint-Stock Companies Act of 1857, certain other resolutions requisite to carry out fulDy the objects for which that course was adopted will be proposed to the adjournd meeting to-day. Should the shareholders, as they wtill see it to be their interest to do, approve them, the fuinctions of this committee wrill naturally cease, their further services. "'The commuittee have been too fuUy occupied to allow of their goinu into any inquiry as to the origin of the present diflicultJes, feeUng likewise that the time had not arrived for such an investigation. Whether it shaU be the pleasure of the sbareholders to institute it through them, or otherwise, must be left a subject for further consideration. " 'The committee cannot, however, conclude the report without expressing the approval of the manner in which the directors of the bank have received the various suggestions and recommendations they have made to them from time to time, and of the readiness with which thoy have during the wvhole period of their joint actigon a,ffordod to the cQwm' m;ttee every information in their power on the different subjecs to which their attention has been directed. " IJOHIN B. BRANCKER, ! "'bCairman of the Committee of Shareholders." The report of the accounts of Messrs. Ef. Banner and Son was next read. It stated that they had compiled a state. ment of the affairs of the bank, bat the committee, their legal advisers (Lace and Co.), and Mr. Field were of opinion that it was not to the interest of the shareholders that that statement should be read. The interests of the shareholders depended upon two matters-first, on the necessity of neither doing nor saying anything which might directly or Indirectly touch the position of any parties who have engagements with the bank, especialy in a case like this where there is a large quantity of paper bearing the bank endorsement which ought to be met by the parties primarily liable upon it; and, secondly, that the assets have been valued at the present depreciated rate of such securities in the market-rates which, in realizing, it is hoped will be ex.' ceeded; but any statement of those valuations could onlyi tend, by making known the depreciatlon atwkich they have been taken, to operate against what is considered the intriLsic value of the respective properties, such value as, in fact, in improved times would certainly ia most i cases be obtained. A large portion of these assets consist of securities of various Idnds, in land, in ships -some few in shares and other matters. To get tbe vaiuations of these securities as correctly and as | safely as posidble, it obtained the assistance of Mr. Cuishaw and Mxr. Lamport, whose estimates are formed upon the presert depreciated value of the different properties subnitted to them. It will be understood that such valuations can little be depended upon as the prices which might be obtained when mnercantile matters settled down again to their accustomed coure ; and It will also be well understood how largely the circumstances of the times have operated against the interests of the shareholders, both as regards the value of the property which they hold, and the increase in the liabilities of the hank, which latter has almost daily been taking place by the suspension of mercantile houses with engagements bearing its endorsement. The estimate of these engagements is large certainly; but, after all, it is merely an estimate, and it is quite impossible to say whether or not the amount may be exceeded, and to what extent. ' Into the accounts upon which thelosses have occurred," continues the report, " I have not had time to enter closely. They have most of them been current upon the books of the bank for some years, and I see that large amounts have been written off from time to time to the debit of profit and loss, the sum of 371,1781. 19s. Id. having been written off between June, 1854, the year in which Mr. Oliver stopped, and the same time in 1857. Covering a period of four years only it has been thought, and probably with reason, that one or two prosperous years would place these accounts upon a legitimate footing, and meantime the business of the bank was so large and the real profit so great that any deficiency ocourring might be made good out of the annually undivided portion of those profits. 'Unfortunately this project has not been realized, and the crisis whiAch has now come ugon this iustitutlon has been in its consequences, and stLl is, most disastrous. In conclusion I have to say that I have thought it right to the proprietors to examine the accounts of the directors and managers. The latter have always been in credit, and of the former two only have overdrawn balances; one is covered to a considerable extent, and more than the difference is now about being brought in in cash, the other will, doubtless, shortly be arranged. I fi[ed that Mr. Smith, the late manager, was a purchaser of shares as lately as May last, the price paid being 10L 6e. 3d. per share; and your respected chairman has been a purchaser still more recently. I find also that the only shares held by the directors w hich have changed hands for many years were a small lot transferred by one director to another in February. 1856. "HEARMOOD W. BANNER, Accountant." The following resolutions were passed unanimously:- "1. That the report of the directors, including that made by Isl. Banner, now read, be and the same is hereby adopted. " 2. That the several acts done and measures taken by the committee of shareholders appointed by the board of directors, and an informal meeting of shareholders, held on the 30th day of October, 1857, be and the same are hereby adopted and confirmed.

" 5. That the thanks of this meeting be offered to Mr. | Eolt, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Aikin, and Mr. Edward Moon, for consenting on the requisition of the directors and the committee ofhareholdersto act as mediators in all questons arising between the bank and its creditors and betr.een the shareholders in the bank inter se, and that they be requested to continue to give the bank the benefit of their valuable I services in the same capacity. "6. Tbat it appears to this meeting that the losses of the company have exhsusted the fund in the deed of settle- meat of the company called the " Reserved Snrplus Fund,"! and also oue-fourth part of the capital of the company actually paid up by the proprietors; and it also appears that three-fourths of the said capital have become unavail- able by reason of the aforesaid losses of the company, and j of the remaining capital thereof being invested on securities I which are not at present convertible. 4 7. That having regard to the circumstances mentioned in the lst resolution, all the proprietons of the company present at this meeting require that the company be forthwith dissolved, and declare that the Lame stands and is dissolved accordingly, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the doed of settlement of the company, and of the Joint-Stock Banking Companies Act, 185, whereby it is provided that for the purpose of wineing up the company its corporate estate and all its corporate powers shall continue. " 8.

Mt. JULLIrZE"S CONCEZRTS. The house last night was crowded to overflow, the attraction being one of those *" morceaux de circoustance" (as AL JuUien designates them) to which the pubhc has been annuallyaccustomed at these popular entertainments. The title of the present coopoeition is The .itsian Fantowia ancd GHcnr avdocl.?8Triumph~Adfirch aud, as may begeaesed, its predominant tone is martiaL. To meet this exigency M.Julien's own magnificent band wasfortified by an army of drummers and fifera from the Grenadier, Cold tream, nd Bcota Fusileer Guards-together with bagpipes, " tom-tomus," and other instruments calculated to heighten the "local" colouring, and an efficient chorus. The number of vocal and instrumental performers wax thus increased to such an extent that the orchestra was obliged to be considerably eularged to hold them; and even as it was a great many of the execatants could scarcely find elbow-room. 'ihe whole presented a most imposing appearance, and when M. Jullien waved his conductor's stick to begin a dead silence gave evidence of the goneral interest cieated and of the expectation that zomething unusually eiirring and inpressive was about to be heard. The result sarpassed anticipation. Not only was the piece applauded unanimously at every occurrence of a pause in the performance, but the climax gave rise to an excitement beyond bounds. Independent of the music, however, there were reasons for the demonstration that ensued, which would have caused enthusiasm under any circumstances. Passing over the preliminary discourse-which takes up a rage and a half of tho printed programme, and touches, among other topics, upon Alexander the Great, the ADgloSaxon race, the Koran, and the Juggernaut-we may at once state that the fantasi (almost as mnuch a spectacle as a musical display, perplexing the eye in consequence of its indispensable accessories, just as it astonishes the ear) is distribated mto five parts. The first four are dedicated to the music, dances, religious ceremo.ies, &c., of the Hindoos; and the variety of subjects suggested have been seized upon and appropriated with the utmost felicity. PartI. comprises the "Taza-ba-Taza "- vwhich those who are acquainted with the music of the East vill recognize as a genuine Brahmia H;mn-and some military strains, after the time and measnre of a march, wherein llabratta, Sikh, and Ghoorka soldiers are presumed to be engaged. Part IL contains the "' Timoong-Boorong" (Bird-song), and a dance of Byaderes, used with striking effect as a themne for variations on the flute, piccolo, and violin, which were admirably executed by Messrs. Pratten, De Folly, and Viotti Collins. In Part IlL we have an air entitled the " Goonong SahyanZ," and a wild tune supposed to be performed on various instruments, to the accompaniment of dancing in the procession of the car of Juggernaut. Part IV. begins with the "Muezztn," the Mahomedancall toprayer,which M. F'elicien David has introduced in his Dcser. lL David gives thisto a voice ; but M. Jullien, with better judgment, has allotted it to the oboe, and its execution by M. Lavigne is marvellous, not merely for fie tone and unerring intonation, but for a power of sustaining the breath of which we can remenmber scarcely an example on so difficult an instrament. A dance of Dervishes, both savage and grotesque, ensues; and the whole terminates with the song of the "Elephant Driver," and the characteristic music of the "- Snake Charmer," in which the remarkable talent of Xf Lavigne is again displayed, The fifth and concluding part is a battle piece, illustrating a series of military incidents and achievements, the heroes of which are General Havelock and his devobo warriors. We have here the gatherings of divisions, marches, advances, battles, and skirmishes, enlivened occasionally by the sounds of the bagpipe and the national war song of the Righlanders. The *' Campbells are coming" is first heard from a distance, and then, by a cleverly mansged "crescendo," swelis out into an overpowering fortissimo" for the entire orchestra. When the crowning victory is obtained the band, with the inultitudinous drums and fifes of the regiments already mentioned, perform in obstreperous harmony a hold and vigorous air cailed " General Havelock's Triumphal MIarch," while the chorus declaim the following verses: Sing forth the praloe I *' On, like a Fcourge "Let us proclaim "Suiting the toe, "Hivalock's brave deeds, "Like Heaven's bolt. " Couquests anud fame I * Swift be doth sO o "Sound, trumpets, drums Fierce to avenge "lRoar, carnon, roar I " Treason and crime, "Ten echo', voice - Winning a nane Coease never more. '- Deathlesa in tme. "On. gauantband, " 3ighty, tho' Smai4 "Follow your star, "C onquer or fAu I "While nations love *- Valoen to came, "Glory shall sond Loadly your fAme." The whole terminates with " Rule Britannia" and" God save the Queen." The execution throughout was strikingly good, and the conclusion hailed with uproarious applause end unanimous cries for a repetition of the national airs. Instead of acceding at once, however-in accordance with his usual custom-to this patriotic demand, M. Jullien, as soon as he could extort attention, addressed the audience something to this effect:-" Ladies and Gentlemen,-As we are honoured this evening by the presence of Lady Havelock, the wife of the distinguished General-that British lion who has so nobly hunted down the Beng:l. tigerI am sure you wiU all be as delighted as I am to know that she is among us." Then, pointing to a box on the first tier, he said, " There is Lady Havelock !" This announcement was received with such tremendous cheering that Lady Havelock, who had been quietly listening to the music, in little expectation of such an incident, rose from her Eeat, and, coming forward to the front of the box with her two daughters, gracefoily saluted the audience. The acclamations that followed were again interrupted by M. JulLien, who spoke in a loud voice. and evidently as excited as if he had been an Englishman born. "Now, ladies and gentlemen,' he said, " you shaU join with me in three British cheers. I will give the w.ord, and you shall aU respond, ' ensmble." " IIe did gve the word, and his "flip, hip, hip, hurrah," thrice reiterated, was thrice echoed by such a h hurrah" from the united voices of the whole assembly as made the walls " reverberate again." Rwarely has a scene of greater enthusiasm been witnessed. Lady Havelock remained until the end of the performance, and the great majority of the crowd kept her company. When the last piece-a galop calied the Lzon and Tigerwas finished, the audience dispersed slowly, and the scene of " ovation" was changed from the theatre to the open street. A dense crowd almost blocked up the thorougfare ; and as Lady Havelock was recognized entering her carriage the chee-ing was reoewed with the same vociferous heartiness as was at 5rst elicited by M. Jullien's address.
THE MAns, &c.-SovrTnAmaroN, Thursday.-The Boyal Mail Company's steamship Tamar, Captain Jel)icoe, sailed hence to-day for Malta and Alexandria with the Australian and New Zealand mails, 3,30(1. in specie, jewelry value 20,0001., and a miscellaneoas cargo. She took out 73 passengers, including 14 officers of the 69th Rei ment; also, Captain Saunders for Galle; CaptainE Grogan, Lieutenants Trevor and Brodigan for Malta, &a.- and 231 rank and file of the 69th. The Union Screw Company'Js steamship Norman, Captain Boxer, left to-day for the Cape of Good Hope, calling at Plymouth for the muails;* she takes about 20 passer,gers, and 5,0001. in specie. The cargo of the ship Newv Great Britain, whqich put in here yesterday, is to be discharged. A DAY wiTH NENA SAmB,-Here sat the Mabhrajah on a Turkey carpet, and reclining slightly on a huge bolster. In front of him were his hookah, a sword, and several nosegays. His highness rose, came forward, took my hand, led rue to the carpet, and begged of me tobeseated on a cane-bottomed armchair, which had evideritly been placed ready for my especial ease and occupation. A hookah is called for by the Bajah, and then at ieast; dozen voices repeat the order-" Hookah lao sablb ke waste" (bring a hookah for the aahib). Presently the hookah is brought in. It is rather a grand affair, but old, and has evidently belonged to some European of extravagant habits. . . . While I am pulling away at the hookah, the musahibs, or favourntes of the Rajah, flatter me in very audible whispers. "How well be smokes!" '" What a fine forehead he has I" ' And his eyes ! how they sparkle ! "YNo wonder he is so clever!" "1 He will be Governor-General some day," "khuda.kurin !" (God wil have it so). . . . . Native Bajah (in a loud voiee), " hloonsheo I" Moonshee (who is close at hand).- "Maharaj, Protector of thO Poor." Native Rajah.-" Bring the petition that I have laid before the Governor-GonersL The Moonshee produces the petition, and at the instance of the Rajah reads, or rather sings It aloud. The RZjajh listens with pleasure to its recital of his own wrongs, and I affect to be astounded tbat so much injustice can possibly exist. During my rambles in India I have been the guest of come scores of iajahs, great and small ; and Inever knebw one who had not a grievanoe. He had either been wronged by the Government, or by some judge whose decision had hece aginst him. In the matter of the Government it was a sheer love of oppression that led to the evil of which he complained; in the matter of the judge, that functionary had been bribed by the other part. It was with great difficulty that I kept my eyes open while the petition-a very long one-was read aloud. Shortly after it was finished I craved permission to retire, and was conducted by a bearer to the sleeping room. . . . . The Maharajah invited me to accompany him to Cawnpore. I acquiesced, and the carriage was ordered. The carnage was Eiglish built-a very handsome landau-and the horses were English horss ; but the harne^s ! It was countrymade, of the very cemmonest kind, and worn out ; for one of the traces was a piece of rope. The coachman was filthy in his dress, and the whip that he carried in his hand was n old broken buggy whip which some European gentlemran must have thrown away. On the box, on either tide of the coachman, sat a warlike retainer, aennd with a sword and a dagger. In the rumble were two other retainers, armed in the same maanner. Besides the Rajah and myself there were three others (natives ard relatives. of the Rajah) in the vehicle. On the road t!e Rajah tal-ked incessantly, and among other things that he told me was this-in reference to the praises that I bestowed or, bis equipage :-' Not long ago I had a carriage and horses. vory superior to these. They cost me 25, 00 rupees ; butt I had to burn the carriage and kill the horses." " why so 7" "The child of a certain sabib in Cawapore vvra ver sick, and the sahib and the metneahib were briging the child to Bithoor for a change of air. I sent my hig a r for them.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (BY 8IBriA1Em AND BRITISH TERBAPEH.) (The foUowing appeared in our second editlon of yell teraav ~-1 We have received the following telegram from our Paris correspondent:- "PARIS, THunSDAY, Nov. 12, 8 A.3L "'. Abbatucci, the Minister of JTustice, is dead. "The Legislative Body is convoked for the 28th." (FROM OUR OWVN CO1REPONDEWT) PARIS, WEDNESDAY, Nov. 11, 6 P.Y, The letter of the Emperor to the Minister of Finance is diversely judged. Some think it an unanecesmaiy manifesto, and others look upon It as merely an answer to M. Delamarre's article in the Patrie the other night, which brought an " avertissement" on his head. rPew are honoured by having an .mperor for correspondent, and the Patrie will console itself forthe brusque interference of the Minister of the Interior and the Prefect of the Police. In this controversy, however, the terms are aot the rame. One may carry on a discusajonwith an equal, but you can hardly do so with a disputant who commnands 20 legions. It is said that the exportation of gold has dinimished for some days past, in consequence of the measures adopted by the Government. Inspectors from the Minister of Finance called on the prncipal money-changers in Paris and recommended them to refrain from exporting gold or silver coin. The Droit and Gazette de France announce that proceed,ngs have been commenced against three moneychargers on a charge of purchasing Imperial coins at a premium. I have already mentioned that seveW1 foreign liplomatists had endeavoured to effect a reconciliation between Redschid Pasha and M. Thouvenel, the French Minister at Constantinople. The latter, however, is not to be reconciled, and-as often occura in such cases where zealous friends interfere- the breach aeems wider than ever. M. Thouvenel will not talk with him, pray with him, nor eat with him, for he refused an invitation to dinner some dayis ago. The statement published In some of the papers relative to an attempt having been made on the lfe of the Shah of Persia by one of the sect of the 3Barbis is contradicted on, I am assured, official authority. The Shah returned to Teheran on the 14th of September with al hit Court, on his return from the encampment of Elbourz, rwhere he spends the summer months. The latest accounts describe the situation of the country as favourable. The bands in Khorassan had been vigorously punished by the troops sent against them under the orders of Fezyali-Khan. A letter from Marseilles, of the 10th Inst., states {hat durin.g the previous 15 days from 5) to 60 ,nerchant ships, w=hich sailed thence for various ports, but principally for the Levant, had been forced to return and seek shelter in the Frioul, many of them severely damaged. The south-south-east -winds which have prevailed at Marseilles for several days have prevented the ships in the port from sailing. The first electric despatch addressed from Algiers to Marseilles, and dated the 5th inst., announced that Marshal Randon, the Governor-GeneraL had arrived at Algiers that morning, on board the Cacique, which sailed from Marseilles on the 3d inst. The following private telegram has been received "Marsellles, Nov. 10. "A dvices from Naples of the 7th states, that the Infant3 Amalia, married to Don Sebstian, died the day before o' J,ronchitis.

THE PASSPORT SYSTEM IN FPRANCE. TO TME EDITOB OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In The Times of to-day you have'given two iDstances 'of the " inconvenience" of the passport system in France. Will you allow me to give another illustration of the very Serious annoyance to whioh it exposes itB victims ? I live in England, and visit France occadionally. I was £here three months ago, and residing in the town of Versailles, when business recaUed me to England. The day Ibefore my departure I went to the Prefecture with the passport which had been given to me by one of the French Consuls In this kingdom, and I desired it to be mis en rgZe. I was told it would serve me no longer, and that a new one was necessary. On asking for a new one I was informed that a new one could not be furnished unless I procured a " permission" at the Town-hall. On going there I wras told that my old passport was perfectly useless, and that I must have the testimony of two a§nwins patent4s, as though Ihad nsever had any passport before. I passed the remainder of the day lookiDg for solos friends to favour mo with this fornality, but unfortunately at that time most of them were cux eaux or travelling for pleasure. At last I found two who promised me to be st the TownhaU the next day at 2 o'clock a.m. They came at the time, snd, having testified that I was " not a vagabond," I received permisdon to have a passport. Bat before leaving I was told that previous to my going to the Prefecture I must go to the Percepteur des Contributions, Avenue de Sb. Cloud, to pay for my passport (10.) I hastened thither, but was too late, for the office of the Percepteur is closed at 2 o'clock. This day was thus lost to me; and on Inquiry at what hour the office -would be opened next day I was told it would not be open at all on that day, as it was only open three times a-week; and I was requested to caU the day after, which I did, greatly to my annoyance as well as ' inconvenience." At 12 o'clock on the day fixod I apPeared at the Prefecture and was told I could not have my passport till 4 o'clock, as the secretary did not sign them Wefort: that hour. The delay on this occasion, shameful and Vexatious as it was, was not so bad as it might have been, Since I was coming to England, and therefore I was not obliged to have my passport *isid by the ambassador in Iraris; but had I been going to any other foreign 4ountry I should have lost one day more. As it was I was detained three days. Now, Sir, supposing that I heard by a telegraphic de. Spatch that some dear relative of mine in England was dying, and could not live 4S hours, would there not, in addition to the "humiliation and degradation" which you have so forcibly pointed out-would there not be cruelty as weU as inconvenience in this vexatious system, which detained me from witneesing the last moments of my Iriend ? I am. Sir. von,- Ih-Ao,-+. 4 GUSTAVE ALBITT. Late French Consul at Ostend. The Cedars, Cobham, Suzrey, Nov. 11.

I MILITARY AND NA 7AL INTELLIGBNCB His Royal Highness the Dake of Cambridge, as Goneral Commanding In Chief, held a lev6e at the Horse Guards yesterday. The attendance of officers was very numerous. By the mail steamahir, Tamar, which sailed yesterday, 14 offleers and 281 men of the 69th Regiment have left for Alexandria, thence proceeding to India by the overland route, tia Suez. The following is a list of the officers who have embarked In this steamerMajor Fenwiek, Captains G. Bagot, A. B. Hankey, Bowen, and J. Smyth; Lieutenants G. Bulyor, Hatohlison, E. Boyle, and P. B. Clark; Ensigns St. George, R. Daubeny, P. Beames, and P. Shuttleworth; and Assistant-Surgeon Whittaker. The Peninsular and Oziental Company's steamships Sultan and Euxine have been chartered for the same purpose; the former vessel leaves this on the 16th inst., and embarks troops at Plymouth on the 17th, the latter leaves on the 1st proximo, and embarks troops at Plymouth on the 2d. The half-yearly inspection of the corps of Royal Engineers took place yesterday afternoon at Brompton barre.ks, Chatham, the inspecting field-offler being Colonel W. H. Eden, Commandant of Chatham garrlson. he whole of the officers and men at present at head-quarters, to the number of nearly 1,000, including the East India Company's Sappers and Miners, assembled on their parade ground at 2 o'clock in marching order, wbere they were put through a vaziety of evolutions, which they performed in an admirable manner. At a late hour on Wednesday a despateh was received at Chatham garrison from the War-offlie, countermanding the order previously given for the embareation of the reinforcements for the 20th, 23d (Welsh Fusileers), 35th, 53d, 61st, 84th, and 90th (Light Infantry) Regiments, on the following day, owing to the George Marshall, freight-ship, not being ready to roeive them. Previous to the embarcation of the reinforements the vessel will be inspeocted by the Commandant at Chatham, in order that everything may be done for the comfort and convenienco of the troops proceeding to India. A detachment of troops belonging to the Cape Mounted Rifles left Chatham yesterday for the purpose of embarking at Southampton on board the mail steamer procaeding to the Cape of Good Hope. Her Majesty's receiving ship Fisgard, bearing the flag of Commodore Shepherd, stationed off Woolwioh Dockyard, is ordered to be paid off on the 31st of December. The Brilliant, 20, Captain James A Paynter, from North America and the West Indies, arrived at the Nore yesterday at noon. She is under orders to proceed to Chatham, there to be paid off. The following appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty - Commander W. A. R. Pearse, to the Alert, commissioned; Commander J. H. Csve, to the Ardent, commissioned; Commander B. B. Oldfield, to the Lyra, commissioned; Lietenant A. B. Hodgkinson, to the Viper, commissoned; Lieutenant H Berkeley, to the Lynx, commissioned; and Lieutenant C. Gibbons, to the Sharpshooter, commissioned. THE MILITIA. The 3d West York Militia, consisting of 27 offlcers and 775 men, under the command of Colonel Loftus, arrived yesterday at Aldershott. The 49th East Kent Militia Regiment, under Colonel Brockman, quartered at Canterbury, is under orders to proeted to Woolwich.
I TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIVTE& Mr,-Havlng already addressed myself to your columns on the subjeot of "what to do with the captured muti. neers," I cannot ress making some remarks upon the communication which appears in your yesterday's Issue, signed by a remorseless " Andaman," whose character appears to partake of the ruggedness of the islands he so faithfuUy poortray S. Agreeing with him that, as Englishmen, we cannot have recourse to the "safest and easiest" remedy, to which he so feelingly alludes, I cannot subsoribe to his recommendation for shipping off these bloodthirsty "savages" defenceless to make head against others seven times worse thanthemssves, when it is weU know that both their labour and lives could be made of use to themselves and Great Britain in other less "cannibal" parts of the world. No one conversant with the practical carrying out of sentences of hard labour in the East Indies will deny that to allow these "gentle Bindoos" to remain as convicts there would be nearly the same thing as not punishing them at alL Half the terrors of transportation would be dispeUed were the places seleoted for penal settlements within the ken of the mutineers or their families. The subject of expense of transportation Is one which would be easily settled so far as the West Indian merchants are concerned, for they are already spontaneously paying the whole cost of importation of as many Coolies as their Indian agents can collect, and this, too, they do with the obligation of finding these Indian labonrers return passages on the expiration of their industrial resIdences. I w3il not venture to question the probability that these "wretched mutineers" wiU some day or other evince those feelings of gratitude for being placed in so highly enviable a location asthatassignedto themby "Andaman," or that such hardened sinners as these Indian Sepoys should in due course of time discover the true light of Christianity in those " unamiable islands," which, according to your correspondent, are so utterly destitute of even terrestrial luminaries; but I do earnestly trust that when cotton and sugar are at their present prices, and when there is such a demand for manual labour, no authoritles, either Indian or British, will be led into transporting useful labourers to out. of-the-way places, where at best they can only feed themselves or assist in maintaining the keepers of a lighthouse establishment, the national utity of which may possibly be questlonable. In concnsion, I leave it to the p7blic to decide which of the two schemes is the best and most comprehensive for BONA EX MAIM. Nov. 12.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the absence of better informatlon I can inform your correspondent "Barnacle Minimus" that the plan of building a large iron ship in a hole has been tried and with entixe success * the Great Britain iron ship was built in a hole at Bristof about 14 years ago, and without the advantages of the seashore or a navigable river; she was launched in a few minutes, without the lest possible risk in any way, and withoat expense. If it will make any useful addition to the above statement, I was present during the ceremonv. R. H. b.l'mlnglism, Nov. 11.
ulieE umTi SEGuiENT.-Yesterday upwarh of I500 of the non-commissioaed officers and privates of this regiment, which is under orders to proceed to India, dined together in the Crystal Palace, -with some of their wives and children. The party arrived from Portsmouth early in the forenoon, accompanied by Colonel Smythe and the other officers of the regiment, by whom all the expenses were paid, and at 1 o'clock sat down to a substantial dinner provided by Messrs. Staples in the large concert-room. After dinner they p;oceeded toview the wonders of the palace, and at 4 o'clook took their departure by special train for Portsmouth. Scorrise UNIVieRsrrY REFORM.-The annual meeting of the Association for the Improvement an-d Extension of the Scottish Universities was held ox. Saturday in George-street Hall, Edinburgh. Colonel Mure, of Caldwell, presided on the occasion, and among the gentlemen present were Sir E. T. Colebrook, M.P., Mr. Stirling of Keir, M.P., the Rev. Dr. Hanna, Principal Tulloch, and Professors Blackle, Pillaus, and Fraser. Apologies for non-attendance were received from Sir David Brewster, Ufr. Dunlop, M.P., the Rev. Dr. Guthrie, and the Rev. Dr. Robertson. Mr. J. R. Stodart, the secretary, read the report of the general committee, which referred in particular to the conference held some time ago with the Lord. Advocate, in which his Lordship expressed his desire to introduce some Parliamentary measure for the reform of the Scottish Universities at the earliest favour. able opportunity. Resolutions were afterwards proposed and adopted expressing the necessity for im. proving and expanding the Scotch Universities, with a view to meet the demands of the age and the competition of the reformed Universities of England, anticipating from the encouragernent given theru by the Lord-Advocate that the objects of the association would in a great measure be achieved were a sufficient amount of public sympathy and support elicited, and pointing out several of the reforms that were most desired by the friends of the Scottish University system,-such as an increase of professorial power and the tutorial element; the establishment of a permanent connexion between the graduates and their respective universities, so as to introduce the infinnce of public opliion into the academical body; and a uniform system of examination. M gsTEious DISAI'PEARANcE.-A Mr. Edward Clegg, traveller for Messrs. James Thompson and Son, corn millers, Bradley Mill, Marsden, left home on his master's business by the 6.55 train from the Nelson station of the East Lancashire Railway, on the morning of Friday, October 30, and proceeded to Wigna to transact business. After concluding his labours he returned to Wigan station, in company with his two brothers. It being the fair, and being anxious, it is stated, to avoid rough company, he took a first-class ticket to Preston, both brothers witnessing his departure with the train about 9 o'clock at night for Preston. Mr. Kellett, of the White Horse Inn, Preston, expected him to stay at his house that night, and in consequence sat up to a very late hour for him, but he did not arrive. Mr. Clegg has not since returned home, neither has he been heard of. His disappearance is inexplicable. His family and friends are exceedingly anxious to know what has become of him, and 'we understand that his brother Charles, of Wigan, in commencing a search proceeded to Preston, and was informed by one of the railway officials there that his brother's ticket was collected on the nightin question, it being the only firstclassticket from Wigan by that train. Mr. Edward ClegP bas been in the habit of going the journey to Wigau and other places for his employers, Messrs. Thompson, for the past four years. and during that time has had frequently as much as from 7001. to 8001. in his possession, moneys received on behalf of the firm. On the present occasion he did not receive so much money as usuaL Many rumours are afloat concerning him, some to the effect that he has been robbed and murdered; others that he bag "bolied."

NEW WESTAItNSTZR BRIDaB. It s more than a century sinoe old WestamInster-bridge was opened for traffic to the public, and it is very nearly the same time since it fell into a state of chronic dilapidatlon and decay. t Some attribute this premature decrepitude to the removal of old London.bridge, and the consequent in creae of the "scour" with which the tide rashes ous; others aver, with more trath, that it in entirely owing to the inefficient nature of the foundetlon, But whatever the canse the fact remains the same, and ia the meaory of the "oldest inhabitant" the whote structure has always been an impediment to trafflo whether by land or water. We must not scan to. severely the faults of our ancestors, and therefore not sto to inquire how generation after generAtion have shelved th3 question of building a new bridge, how the scheme ha struggled through one mishap into another-was entwined amid the folds of red tape, and smothered in the dust of circumlocution, tiUl the whole idea of the bridge was an official myth, a sort of PFlying Dutchman" that haunted the waters between Stangate and hfllbauk. Many were the years drinBg which It led this unrea' existence, but at iast it emerged, the plats were definitely adopted, contraoted for, begun, and, after a last effort of adverse destiny to stop the work by "stopping" the coitractors, they have been committed to the care and energy of Mr. Page, the designer of the bridge, and are therefoze now in fir way of completion. Ever since the works have been recommenced the men have been engaged upon them at all low tides, whether by day or night, During some nights electric lights were used, bat withouany great success, for their glare was so strong and the shadows so intensely dark that the men we-e dazzled, and were continually falling off the scaffoldings or into the water, so that the "new lights" were at last givev up and sober gas reverted to. Since then all has gone welL Already the foundations of the piers are reporting progress above low watermark, and once clear of the water the work wil advance with threefold rapidity. Just now except to the practised eye of the engineer, very little o' Mr. Page's great plan can be appreciated. The works seem a mere labyrinth of stroug scaffolding, covered aloft with "travelers" and below a medley of little planks, pile-drivers, slabs of granite, iron, and elm piles, divers and diving bells, spiral pumps, and crowds of men, all of which seem either placing or being plaoed, and to be generally at work together. The Estm pile-drivers, with monkeys of 2j tons, work with a rapid and angry beat, under which the monstrous sfts of elm sink with noiseloss celerity into the tide, while as fast as one goes down the "traveller," hovering over-head like a 5ird of prey, is ready with another pile or a piece of granite-in itselE equal to a small quarry-suspended In Its grasp. In the centre of the river, where the wrought-iron tie bars are being fastened through the foundations, the spectator is rather puzzled; for a number of men are sitting Idly in boats intently watching stout cords which they hold in their hands, as it they were fishing and eagerly waiting fo: a bite. This is where the divers are at work low down on the bed of the river, screwing the tie bolts anld placing th3 bags of concrete which are lowered down to them from the top of the scaffolding. When one foundation is completed the en,gineer goes down and inspects the whole work in a diving bell, many of whioh are used upon the works of all sizes, from the little iron sentry-box for the accommodation of one man up to the huge apartment which weighs some 8 or 10 tons and accommodates as many divers. Now and then curious accidents have occurred to the divers, though none of them fatal. The other day, while some were down in a bell, the air pipe broke, the water rashed in, and the men with great difficulty escaped from under it and reached the surface of the water, wheu they were saved. Another time one of the divers, while on the bed of the river, broke the glass eye of his helmet and only saved himself by tbe greatest coolness and presence of mind; but in spite of these little contretemp8 the divers are always downsome remaining four hours at a stretch-and the work advances daiy. Iit a few days Mr. Page Is about to use the electric light under water, so that the men can work at the foundations at any depth and at any hour. The design of the new bridge is, as we have intimated, Mr. Page's, and it more than sustains the reputation 'Which that gentleman has already acquired from his beautiful work a' Chelsea. Sir Charles Barry was consulted as to the ornamental details, and he gave Mr. Page the benefit of his valuable advice and assistance in the formation of deslgna in keeping with the architecture of the Houses of Parliament. The result is a bridge the most elegant in design and the most graceful and artistic in general effect that has ever crossed the waters of the Thamies. It is light in appearance, being composed of iron arches on piers of masonry, though in reality of unusual strength and solidity. The pieras form massive and noble-looking structures, and are surmounted with columnar alcoves of the most graceful proportVans. The spandrils of each arch are decorated with rich ironwork castings; the parapet, side-rail, and cornice are replete with Gothic decorations in the same material. The shape of the arch is entirely new in bridge work, being a curve parallel with an ellip-se, which gives to the whole a graceful sweeping outine, simple and elegant in the last degree, and makes it beyond aU doubt the handsomest arched bridge yet erected over the river The position which this much needed structure wiUl ocoupy is almost the whole of the site of the old bridge and about 40 feet on the western side of it next the new Houses. The new one will consist of seven arches, with three small culvert arches for the passage of the water through the abutment on the Surrey side (but none of these will be seen). The general dimensions of the whole work are as follows :-Extreme length, 3,160ft. 3in.; width, 85ft.; span of largest arch, 120ft.; smaltest ditto, 94ft. 9in.; height of centre from Trinity high-water mark, 22ft. 8in.; height from foundation, 62ft. The rise on the whole bridge is 6ft. 3Am. This, apparently, is hal the rise of the old bridge, but in reality it is much less than half, snce It joins the roadway ataslower leveL The immenseadvantages which the new bridge wiil possess over the old bridge (built by Labelye, a Swiss, in 1740) will be best seen by a comparison of their dimensions. The length of the present structure i; 1,160ft. 8in. ; extreme width 44ft.; width of roadway 26ft., and of footpaths 8ft. each. Height from foundation to centre arch 57ft., depth of foundations below low-watec mark 6ft. (the foundations for tae new bridge are 29 feet deep). The rise of the old bridge is lOft. 6in., but it joia, tne road-way at so high a level that its centre is nearly 11 feet above that of the proposed new bridge. But it Is not alone in dimensions that the new work will surpass the old. In beauty of outline and massiveness of construction it will be equally superior. In no part of the work is this increased solidity more apparent than in the foundations. Several of these piers are much advanced, and such progress is daily made that before six months a'l these at least will be completed for the first half-width of thestructure. In construction these foundations resemble those of Chelsea-bridge, only they are stronger in relative proportion to the weight they have to bear. These foundations combine all the advantages of foundations oa bearing piles made by means of cofferdaras without the expense and obstruction to the waterway which the latter involve, and which would have renderel their use at this bridge all but impracticable. The bearing piles are driven home at intervals of 1 foot 9 inches from centre to centre to an average depth of 29 feat 6 inches below low-water line, or more than 20 feet iato the London clay. Round these bearing piles a casin, of cast-iron piles and plates is driven to a great depth, and the whole mass fastened together with a crossing series o; wrought-iron tie-belts. This casing is formed of 44 Css9 iron circular main or guide piles 25 feet in length, each o' which is 15 inches diameter and 1 inch thick, and these are driven in at distances of 5 feet 2 inches, which intervals are afterwards fitted in with sheeting plles, so that the whole o-nA.4on as completely faced wit soi rn h pc foundation Is completely faced withsolld iron-. Th -space thus enclosed is then dredged down between the piles to the hard gravel, and filled in with concrete so as to forn a solid mass. The casteiron sheeting piles between the cir cular ones cease at six feet below low-water line, and the foundatlons are then faced with enormous slabs of granite 20 inches thick. The foundations of the old bridge really bear no comparison in point of strength with those we have just mentioned, for their lowest depth is actually only six feet below low-waterline. This insufficient foundation, coupled wvith the inreased "scour" of the river, by the removal of Old Londonbridge, caused the total break up and decline of Westminster-bridge into its present condition. According to a calculation made by Mr. Page, the pressuro on the bear- ing piles of the new foundations is most unusually slight when compared with the loads generally placed. For instance, at Hull Docks the diameter of the bearing piles of the foundation is only ten inches, yet they are loaded with 37 tons the square foot; at London, bridge, with 10-inch piles, the load is no less than 80 tons ; Eo also is it 80 tons the square foot, with the same sized piles, under the Albertwarehouses at Livernool. In the new bridge the bearing piles are 14 inthes diameter, yet they are only loaded with 12 tons the foot. The prewssr3 per foot superficial on the whole area of the founda tions is only 2 tons, while on the old West minster-bridge it is 6 tons, and in London.bridge 5. It is calculated that elm piles, such as are usAs in these new foundations, would bear ithout perm%nent alteration a oompresive force of 20 tons eoh. All the exterior of the pier above low-water mark prsents one continuous facing of granite,a d s so e tinud ap to th belght whence the arches spring. The weight upon tte granite after the bridge has taken it beaxing will be only two tons to the square foot, the crushing weight of granite being five tons to the square inch, or 700 tons to the squar4 foot. When the bearing plles for the foundation were first used by Mr. Page somo objection was taken to their sta. bility generally, and especially to the danger to which they were exposed from the rapid flow of the tide and the proposed deepening of the bed of the river. These objectionx were successfully combated, and Mr. Page especIally ad. duced the example of old London-bridge, which in many respects was almost similar in the constraction of its founda tlons to the present new bridge, with the important exception that it rested on a much smaUler number of bearing ples. Now, the former bridge, as mayn of our readers must remember, was exooedingly massive and heavy in its construction. It was commenced in the year 1176, fnished in 1209, and taken down In 1834, having stood like a rook 625 years. The topsof the bearing pUes of this venerable structure were at the level of the low water line, yet when the bridge was removed they were withdrawn In almost a perfectly sound state. With regard to the danger to be appre hended to the foundations from the rush of the tide, the statement of the sectional arem under each of the clief metropolitan bridges shows itto be imaginary. Under old Westminster-bridge the area of the waterway in superficial feet is 16,633; Hungerford-bridge, 21,811; Waterloo, 20,844; Blackfrisrs, 16.447; Southwark, 14,628; London, 17,026; and under new Westminster the area will be 18,585. Two feet above high water mark the spring of the arches will commence. Owing to the peculiarly f'at curve of the arches, and consequently their thin crowns, it became necessary to provide for the sectrity and stiffness of the structure in such a manner as would avoid the use of cast iron in the oentral parts of the arches, where they might be subject to percussion from moving loads. The arches have therefore been designed with wrought iron central ribs of ample strength and stiffness, whether regarded as an arch or a girder. These central ribs vary in span from the centre arch, where they are 52i feet by 28 inches deep to the land arches, where they are only 42 feet 3 inches in length by 22 inches deep. These spans are of rollediron 1 inch thick, and are side considerably stronger than is requisite for any load that can possibly be brought upon them. The full load strain of the arches is at the rate of 3 tons the square inch, but the wrought iron p rtions are tested with a compressive strain of more than 12 tons to the square inch, or very nearly 2,000 tons to the square foot. The total weight of ca8t bron which Will be used in the bridge will amount to upwards of 3,000 tons, and of wrought iron to about 1,000 tons. Provision has also been made for expansion in the longitudinsi girders, by fixing vuloanized indlarubber in the joints. On the entire length of girders from arch to arch which are each in three divisions, two of cast iron and one of wrought, there would be an increase of length by a total change of temperature of 50' of half n inch, or one-sixth of an inch at each joint. There is noprovisionfor expansion in the arches, which will rise and fallas in other iron bridges wccording to the change of temperature. One of the greatest advantages which the new bridge will afford over its ruinous predeoessor is its width, and therefore ample accommodation for carriage and passenger traffic. As we have sKid, its extreme width will be nearly 85 feet, or more than do-able the entire width of the presenxt structure. This space w_1l be divided into two footpaths each 15 feet wide, and two carriageways each 26 feet wide. The carriageways will be divided by a centre kerb separating the going and coming traffic, and each will have a tramway of seven feet for the very heavy traffic, the, rest being granite paved in the ordinary manner. Such is a general outline of the principal features of this magnificent structure, which, with New Chelsea, Waterloo, and London bridges, will form a collection of four of the finest bridges of their respective kinds in the world. The total cost of the new bridge, as at present estimated, is 235,0001., or at the rate of 24 8s. 6d. per foot superficial. The cost of the old bridge was 389,5001., which is at the rate of 71. 16s. per square foot of srface, or more than three times the cost of the new. According to the plan laid down by Mr. Page, when the western half of the entire width of the bridge is completed, It can be opened for traffic. This plan is adopted in order to get rid of old Westminster-bridge as soon as possible, for, though n,o recent sinking has occurred, it cannot, nevertbeless, be regarded as in any other than a most dangerous con. dition. When the old bridge to its lowest foundations Ls entirely removed the eastern half of the new bridge will b, proceeded with, and gradually cover the same site with one of the handsomest, and, we trust, one of the most enduring structures of the kind across the Thames.
DO OUR ROAD-MAKERS BEAR GO TO FBANCE? TO THE EDITOR OF THE 2TUES. Sir,-About this time of the year a vat quantity of stones, ready broken and heaped up by the roadsides for the purpose, are suddenly poured upon our hi,,hways. Whole stretches of the principal thoroughfares all over the country are deluged with these loose stones, some three cr four inches in depth, which are left to be ground down or ploughed up, as it may be, by the passing wheels of car. riages. If the weather happen to be dry the nuisanc3 remains for weeks, adding fearfully to the labour of horses, at a season when they are notoriously faint. The intolerable mrss is continually stirred and tossed to and fro by the feet of the unhappy horses, and the wheel of all sorts of vehicles, till three-fourths of the rmutal," as it is caUed, is ground into dust-in other words, is absolutely wasted, and worse, for the first winter's rain converts it into mud, which has to be scraped off and conveyed away. The stony infliction is continually thrown into heaps and furrows by the passing traffic, and requirei, from time to time, levelling with rakes and shovels-an extra expense. Where the whole width of the road is not covered with the new material every driver of a carriage avoids the abomination as long as he can, and the men employed on the roads resort to the ingenious method of laying huge stones on the smooth side, or stretching tressles across it, to force the reluctant Jehus, and still more reluctant horses, back upon the loose stones. Noow, it has often occurred to me, in witnessing this barbarous and uneconomical proceeding, whether, among the vast numbers of our countrymen who annually traverse the beautifully kept highways of France, any of the trustees, surveyors, or overseers of our highways ever mingle among them. If they do, is it not extraordinary that they have not for these years past observed the simple and effec. tual method which our neighbours have of saving their road-metal, their horses, their carriages, and their tempers by passing a stout roller drawn by a stout team of horses over the new material the moment it is laid down? By this method the metal is at once equably pressed down into its place, as soon as it is once laid level, aud the roller is passed and repassed over it till it is nearly as solid and as smooth as the old road. By this means the metal is saved frona that wasteful destruction which it undergoes under our rude and reckless system, and, what is of infinitely more consequence, the horses are spared the inhuman extra tax on their vital energies. How happens it that our Sooieties for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have never thought of this? I wiUl venture to say that more needless cruelty is inflicted on our horses, especially in the neighbourhood of great cities, by this barbarous and wasteful system than by all the savage cabmen that these societies call up for their offences throughout the kingdom. Any one who has occasion to pass up Highgate-rise, a hill in its smoothest state, the name of which is hateful to the ears of cabmen, coal-carriers, brewers, and the like, may at once convince himself, by oberving the violent efforts of loaded teams to getup it, of the truth of this assertion. In fact, Sir, it is high time that we imitated our French neighbours, who are far ahead of us in this respect, aud are really humane to their cattle, while we are only pretending to be so, When the weather is dry they plentifully water their newly-laid roads, so that they may roll solidly and quickly. Some years ago Macadam went abroad, and seeing the infinitely superior state of the roads there came home' and invented the system here called after him. Let some other equally original genius take a look at the road s of France, and invent rollers for highways, and however envious people may. as they always will, pretend that aU that has long been known andvractised on the continent, he will stil have the real merit of being humane and patriotic, for he will do more for the prevention of suffering to horses and the abatement of highway rates, than has been done by any number of men these 20 years, I have lately observed with pleasure that rollers have been applied to the side paths when new gravelled. One more move in advance. Apply them to the main road, and we shall escape from the opprobrium of laggig so far behind our mugenious alles across the OhauneL WILLIAM HOWITT.

(Hear, hoar.) Mr. H3. L. TAYLOR said there 'was no doubt of it. The committee had taken every precaution in their power not to commit the, corporation in any shape whatever, and the sendigu to the Chancellor of the Exchequer the heads of a Bil didl not bind the eorpoain tha encni dered, not only by the columittee, but by that branch of the Government thatbhad had the subject before them, that, rather thana litigate it, it would be far better for the Interests of the public that the question should be decided by Parliament, and the report bimply placed the facts before the oDrporation in order that they miight deal with tbhem in any way they might think proper. The large and Increasing POPulation Of the meOtropolis required bettor accommtodation for a dead meat-market than was afforded in Newpate. mark-et for the supply of three millions of people. Deputy BARNARD said that the inconvenience experienced from the situation and smnall compass of Newgatemarket was very severe to the neighbourhood. Persona were econtinualliy being ruined in the vicinity of the latE. ocn0 4 Frouse wfere empty, and cOonrequently tie rates fell more heavily upon thoso who could iU afford 'o pay tbemn. Until an alteration took place this would go on increasing. Mr. T. H. FRY said he thought the committee had trifled with the questlos, and he earnestly protested apranst any committee of that corporation deciding for therselves upon any site, and going up to the Government with the beads of a Bill and teling them that they were the heads of a Bill with which the corporation were prepared to go to Parliament without first coming to the Court. (Hear, hear.) Complaints had long been made against the Al arkets Improvement Committee for doing such things as tbese, and notwithstanding repeated warnings they wor at it again. This was a repetition of the New Cattle-market scheme. It was an assumption on the part of any commdttee to do what the members of the Court only in their corporate capacity had the right and the authority to do. (Hear, hear.) He entirely disapproved the conduct of the committee who, two days only before it was necessary to give the Parliamentary notices, came for the first time and asked the sanction of the Court to their proceedings.

He thought the Court ought to express its opinion that the committee had no right to go to the Chadnellor of th, Exchequer without first coming to the Courtt. DeputY Bowxst said It was not a questione so much of whether notice ought to he given to Parliament as it was Ia queston whether the authority of the Court wa to be maintained. This was not o he fi, scnd, or third time that the same sort of thing had been attempted by the Mrkets Improvement Committee. let the Court now make a stand against such conduct. Mr. YOUNG said, the unoccupied state of the late marete was a great nuisanoe, and he hoped the report wounld be agreed to. Mr. BLAE- said that if such conduct as that of which the committeeh-adbeen guilty were perseveredin the revenues of the corporation would be entirely frittered away. He moved the previous question by way of amendment. The amendlment was secondd by Alderman Ros& Mr. SCAmELL said, there was no ground for the statement that the new cattle-mnarket would he an annual loss. There were grounds for believing the contrary, Mr. KILDA&Y contended that the committee had nxot exceeled the powers vested in them. Mi.

THE NOVEYfBER "ABMY LIST." TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIhlES. Sir,-I have been looking over the Army List for this month, and cannot help remarking upon the unfair manner in which the captains of Cavalry and Infantry who were placed on half-pay at thls time last year have been dealt with. Thoy were reduced after the Crimean var in a most abrupt manner, to give it the mildest term, and the reason assigned by Government was retrenchment. So far I do not complain; but mark the hardship. Now that their services are again required by the country to quell the mutinies in India they are brought back to fill pay, and a great number of them reappointed to their old regiments. During the period they were so unwillingly shelved many of their subalterns have been promoted to troops and companies, and the reduced captains, their former seniors, are re-gazetted to their old corps, and find them. selves, to their sad mortification, placed below their juniors. They are therefore compelled to serve under their youthful confrcres whom they had instruactod in their military daaies, a position yot will acknowledge as one not only painful, but so obviously unjust, that his Royal Highness the Daks of Cambridge, as a lover of fair play, will, I trust, see the propriety of having this striking and palpable anomaly at once rectified, and the bitter feelings assuased of gaUant men, many of wrhom have stood the brunt of the battle. fields of Alma, Balakslava, and Inkermann, alongs,ide the present popular and able Commander-in-Chief. The remedy is very simple, and, what is most important at such a period of large national expenditure, it wiUl entail no charge on the Exchequer-namely, " to antedate the reappointments of the reduced captains to their regiments without bearing back pay." This merely puts them in the place they originally held in their respective regiments. If this is not conceded by the Horse Gaards, the former subalterns of thesa captains rastored to full pay will most unfairly take precedence, and obtain their majorities and higher advancement in the army, in most cases, years before their original seniors. I observe that the vacancies in Cavalry regiments are not half fiUed up. The reason is plain; and I am not surprised that parents are unwilling to place their sons in a service requiring a large pecuniary outlay, where treatment exists to which no one valuing the advancement of his child can be expected tamely to submit at the hands of the military authorities. I feel confident that the false position which many cap. tains now hold has only to be pointed out to his Royal Highness to insusr a speedy act of justice being done. I have the honour to remain, Sir, Your maost obedient servant. A FATHERI .Nov. 12.
ExTRAoRD1ZARY SCE1X f IN A CHrRCH.-On AU Saint's-day a most extraordinary circumstance took place in Rhos-y-maedre church, Rhuabon. It was known in the neighbourhood that the Rev. R. W.

John Edwards, MA.,A incumnbent of Rhos-y.medre, and, in com-any w,ith his Samzly, attended pubic worship in the panshchurch. Is was sacrament Sauday, and the congregation mnore numerous than usual. The rabrie of the church requires that when a clergyman communicates the consecrated elements should be delvered to him before the other communi ats. Oa the Rev. Mr. Morgan presenting himself and kneeling at the table, the consecrated bread vras duly administered to imby the incuubent, the Rev. J. Edwfadl The admiais. tration of the cup representing the blood of the Saviour should have foUowed, but, to the inexpressible amazement of the congregation, it was withheld and refused Mr. Atorgan by the assistant minister, the Rev. D. R. Davies, the stip :ndiary curate of the district. Mr. Morgan continued to zn-el for several miantes at the altar, then rose, and, wi-h nut speaking a word, retired to the incambent's pew. The pain and distress of the congregation at this scene may be better conceived than described. On Mr. Davies being request *d by the vicar, in the vestiy, in the presence of Mr. Alorgaa, to a:sign his reasons for thus publicly excommunicatirg a clergyman of the church of Bngland from its communio i he replied, " Because I do not thinkl Mr. Morgan is in charity with all his neighbours." The Rev. D. R. Davies is an extreme Puseyite, holding very high doctrines on priestly authority and the powers of the church. On a recent oocasion he declined to be present at a festive treat given by a gentleman of large property in the neighbiur. hood to the children of the-various schools, alleging "that he could not sauction witlh his presence any communication between the children of the church and the children of Dzssenters, heretics, and schismaties, who were out of the pale of salvation."-Carnarvon Herald.

LA W REPORT. COURT OF CAINCERY, IaNcOLN'S-.n. Nov. 12 ELLIOTr V. I-,CE. (Before the LORD CHAhNCELLOR.) wuo oL recoieeowu onar tnis suit, wbich waM instituted between certain creditors of the late birs. Cumming and her coheiresses-at-law, turned upon the quebtion whether Mrs. Camming was or was not of sound mind at the titne that she executed certain deeds inx the muontlis of Miarch, 1847, and August, 1850. The Lord Cbancellor at the hearing of the cause directed an issue at law to try the question, and nominated Dr. ElUiott as the plaintiff. It ap. pea.red that Dr. Elliott was now unwilling to run the risk ot having to pay the costs of an expensive trial at law, and had given notice to the other parties of his intention to abandon any further proceedings in the action. Under these circumstances aome of the other creditors of Mrs. Cnmnsdg were desirous of going on with the action, and the resnt ppliatin ws tohav thir ames substitutedl as plaintiffs, in lieu of Dr. Elliott.tse r. Ialins appeared in support of the motion ; Mr. Bacon and Milr. Mtorris, for Dr. EUliott, offered no opposi- Mr. CAIRNs and Mr. BuEDoz, for Mrs. Ince, one of the awughters and co-heiresses of Mrs. Cumming, resisted the application on the gromnd that it came too late, and also that the interests of tbhe proposed plaintiff were so miinute. The order for the issue had been made last April, and in the month of July, when Mrs. Ince applied to this Court to have the issue taken pro con eso in her favour, a peremptory order was made on r. Eliott, by way of indulgence, to take the issue down to trial at the sittings after the preslent term. INo netice had been gtven by Dr. EUiott to Mrs. Ince of his intention to retire from the action at law. As to the proposed plaintiffi, with the exception of the nurse of Mrs. Cumming, they were creditors to only a trifling amount, some only to the extent of a few shillings, and could therefore be considered merely in the light of stalking horses for the purpose of carrying on the action-the more so as there were creditors to the amount of 5,0001. who would have nothing to do with the trial of the issue. For these reasons the Court ought not to allow lrs. Ince to be harassed by further litigation. At any rate the plaintiffd, if allowed to go on with the action, ought to give security for costs. The LORD CHIANCELLOR said that if the co-heiresses were successfal tbey ought to have their costs, and thereore the parties asking for the present indulgence must give security, to be approved at chambers. The issue bad better be brought in the name of one creditor, and be tried at the sittings in MiddleseC after next Hilary term. The question of costs between the parties themselves would be reserved.

VICE-CHaNCELLORS' COURTS. TnTT"R1 AV N^V 19. 33ARNFS V. TnUTTTV (BfeJoare YiCChancedlOr Sir J. S'UART.) This was a demurrer to the bill which contained allegations to the following effect :-On the 30th of January, 1857, the plaintiff recovered judgment for the sum of 1021, 13s. 6d. in an action brought by him against the official manager of the Royal British Bank. and by an order of Mr. Justice Creswell, made on the 19th of February last, leave was given to the plaintiff to issue execution against the person, property, aod effects of Mr. Thomas Mayhew, who was a shareholder of the bank, for the amount of the judgment, and 141. 5s. 8d. costs. On the 23d of February the plaintiff obtained a writ of elegit against Mr. Mayhew, directed to the sheriff of Suf. folk, and in pursuance of that writ, and of a rule of the Court of Common Pleas, dated the Sth of May last, the sheriff caused an inquisition to be taken on the l9th of May last, by which it was fonnd that Mr. Mayhew was seized in fee of the Crespigny estate and of the Fairfield estate, both in the county of Suffolk, and on that day the sheriff delivered possession of tkese estates to the plaintiff to hold the same uitil the moneys directed in the writ of elegit to be levied ehould have been levied. No part of these moneys, however, had been levied. The first defendant, Mr. Thrupp, claimed to be a mortgagee of the above estates by a deed of mortgage dated before the 8th of May last. The plaintiff Bad offered to pay off the mortgage of Mr. Thrupp, but the latter declined to be paid off by the plaintiff. The bill prayed tbat the plaintiff might be alowed to redeem the property delivered to him under the writ of elegit on paymont of the mortgage money and interest due to Mr. Mayhew, and that the defendant Mayhew might repay to the plaintiff what the latter should pay in respect of the mortgage and Interest, and also pay to the plaintiff the amount of hiB judgment debts and costs, or be foreclosed. To this bill, which was filed on the 28th of July last, the defendant Thrupp demurred. The other defendant, Mayhew, was out of the jurisdiction of the Court. In support of the demurrer it was contended that under section 13 of the ist and2d of Victoria, chap. 10, the plaintiff could not proceedin equity toreformhis charge underhisjudgment untll after the expiration of one year from the time of entering up such judgmaent, and that under section 7 of the 20th and 21st of Victoria, chap. 78, the plaintiff should have obtained the leave of the Court of Bankruptcy to proceed with this suit, for although the bill was filed before the 25th of August, when the last-mentioned Act was passed, yet the seeking to enforce an answer was a proceeding which was prohibited by the Act. Mr. Wigram and Mr. Hardy supported the demurrer; and Mr. ±alins and Mr. W. D. Evans supported the bill. The VICE.CIIANCELLOR said that a very extraordinary question was raised here. After the bill had been filed an Act of Parliament was passed which enacted that without the leave of the Court of Bankruptoy no proceeding should be taken upon any execution after the passing of the Act of Parliament where the execution was against a shareholder of a bankrupt joint-stook company. It had been said that the bill beig a bhi by an execution creditor to redeem was a proceeding upon an execution. The words of the 7th section of the Act referred to were as foUows:--" When any company heretofore has been or hereafter shall be adjudicated bankrupt, then if, or so soon as creditors' assig. uees shall have been appointed, or when any such company shall not have been or be adjudicated bankrupt, then after thejudge or master shall by advertisementhave called on the creditors to appoint a representative or representatives, as hereinbefore mentioned, no action shall be commenced or proceeded with otberwibe than for the purpose of making the company bankrupt, nor shall any execution or sec-c facias be issued or proceeded with against the person, property, or effects of any member or members for the time being of such company, or any former member or members thereof, except by leave of the Court of Bankruptcy, when sueb company has been made bankrupt, before an order shall have been made for winding up the company, or of the the said judge or master, when such company has not been made bankrupt before such order shall have been made." That clearly pointed to the case of suing out execution. But thequestion was whether, when, as in this case, before theAct of P'arliament was passed the writ was actually sued out, and not ouly sued out, but executed-fully and finally executed So far as the sheriff was concerned, and so far as execution could be made,-the filing of this biUl was a proceeding upon an execution, or whether it was not a consequential remedy which was not a remedy by this execution, but a remedy wlhch the plaintiff aUeged was conferred on him by virtue of the writ of execution, which had been finally worked out. The 11th section seemed to iUustrate the matter, for that section gave to creditors who had obtained judgments in Ireland against shareholders, and who had sued out execu. tion, the full benefit of their judgments, notwithstanding the provisions of the 7th section; and it further provided that no creditor who had actually levied execution and claimed to retain the benefit of his judgment or execution should be entitled to receive any further dividend or to have recourse to any other remedy or proceeding other than such right and remedies as he might have in respect of such judgment or execution against the lands which were affeeted by the same until all the other creditors should have been paid in full. Now, a bill to redeem lands of an execution debtor where the creditor had been put by a writ of elegit in possession of those lands seemed exactly to be another remedy and proceeding in respect of the execution. That. therefore, seemed to show that the words of the 7th section, which prevented a creditor from proceeding with his execution, did not apply to the case of a consequential remedy sought by that creditor who had sued and worked out his writ of execution. Upon the whole, therefore, it seemed to him, considering the nature of the remedy sought, that this plaintiff, who filed a bill in this court alleging that a writ of execution had been proceeded with to the ultimate point-that the sheriff had bee put in possession of the lands with a right to the rents and profits, but stating further that that right w-s interrupted by the existence of a mortgage, was not in the situation of a person seeking a remedy consequential upon that proceeding by his judzment, wvhich had been carried to its ultimate point. It seemed to him that the demurring defendat had not made out his proposition as to the construction of the Art, and it vas tO much to say that the plaintiff was not entitled to an answr frm th deendat. Te qustin mnight be again ;raised at the hearing of the cause, whe the Court would havehad n oportnit of earng wat ad been alleged by the defehdaet. On the whole he thought that the de. (Before Vce-aeUor Sir W. P. WOOD.) FAREEROTHER V. ARlKELL. The VICtE-CHANCELLOR gave judguientin this case in the coums of the day. The suit, which Was heard on Tuesday, and reported in Zhe /inma of Wednesday last, seeks specific performauce of a certain memorandum of agreement under which the defendant agreed to asgn to the plaintiff for 10OZ. a patent invention, whce obtained, for purifying whale and seal oil, the plaintiff bearing the expenses of obtaining the patent, i and on his part agreeing to provide suitable premises and apparatus for working the patent * to insure the defendant's hfe, and to do certain other acts in reference to the working and further development of the invention. His Honour having intimated during the argument that the Court wou3d not grant specific performance oE such an agreement, the defendant's counsel were heard upon the question of The VIC.CIIANCELLOR said that the bill disolosed a good grounid of demnurrer, and that this means of defence being open to the defendant he ought not to have put in an answer raising a long series of defences for the mere purpose of putting the plaintiff to the expense of costs. It had been very ably argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the agreement must be taken as consisting of two distinct portions- one, the assignment of the patent by the defendant to the plaintiff wbich the Court could perform; the other, a separate agreement for carrylig on a species of pastoerabip, which the Court might re. ject, not being able to decree specffic performance of all the terms therein contained. It could not, however, be thus divided. The bill was not framed upon this footing; besides which, it was impossible to say that the actual price demanded by the defendant for his patent (1001.) was not affected by the consideration of its being worked, &c. at the plaintiff's expense. Moreover, the autborities presented insuperable difficulties to such a contention. It had been urged by the defendant that the plaintiff had not performed his portion of the agreement as to furnishing suitable premises and apparatus, and in other particulars. The plaintiff, however, had done everything that he fairly could towards carrying out his part of the agreement. He had paid the IOO1 purchase-money (the statement by the defendant that 10. of it was a gift being a mere quibble); he had paid the expenses of obtaining the patent; he had insured the defendant's life; had done his beat to obtain premises, and had gone to considerable expense-a silver still for example-about the matter. No doubt the plaintiff had at one stage of the proceedings rather taken advantage of his superior wealth and position in expecting that the defendant ought to sign everything put before him in reference to the assignment of the patent intended by the plaintiff. Had the case rested there the defendant must have obtained his costs of this suit. It did not, however. Terms were proposed to the defendant ae to the assignment which would have secured to him a3l the benefits as to granting licenses or receiving a salary, which had been provided under the original agreement. But no, he refused to sign anything, thus leaving the plaintiff helpless in respect of the patent with which he nadburdened himself. The defendant had utterly failed to show that Alderman Farebrother had not performed his part of the agreement, and had driven him after so large an expenditure, unattended at present with the slightest benefit, to seek a remedy at law. The defendant had received in every sense all the benefit which he could get from the patent, which he now refused to assign. Although the bill could not be sustained, yet there was sufficient precedent, and it was the proper course to dismiss it without costs. Mr. Rolt and Mr. Jessel were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Cairns and Mr. Drewry for the defendant.

Mr. ROLT and Mr. ROXBURGI a moved on behalf of the official manager of this company that Guglielmo Libri, struck off the list of contributories of the company, in chambers, in respect of 900 shaes, might be settled on the list for the said 900 shares. The case was not fully opened at the rising of the Court. Mr. Cairns and mr. Ksrlakoe oppose the motion.
COURT OF QUE1N'S BENCH. WESnTMTSTER. NOV. 19. EXPARTE EdMILY C1ERRY. (Siaings in Banco, before Zord CAMPBELL and Jut7ices COLERInDE And WTcT'bfAv I Mr. HUDDLESTO2N, Q.C., said, he was instructed, on the part of Emily Cherry, the wife of the Rev. Henry Curtls Cherry. of Burghfield, in the county of Berks, to ask for leave to exhibit articles of the peace against her husband. Lord CAMPBiEm direoted that the applicant should be called into court. Mrs. Cherry was then sent for, and sworn to the truth of the artlcles. The articles were then read by the officer of the court. They stated in substance that the applicant was married to her husband on the 29th of August, 1853. and that from the first moment of her marriage she was a miserable woman. Ier husband immediately commenced a courso of insulting andunkind treatment, and she had notbeon married many weeks whenherhusband, in thepresenceof severalmem. bers of his family, at 10 o'clock at night, told her to leave the house, and added, "T There iE the door." About the 28th of September, 1855, in consequence of violence and il-treatment, she left her husband, apparently with his sanction. On Sunday, the 31st of August, 1856, her husband entered St. G4iles's Church, Reading, where she then was, and at the end of the service seized her by the arm and dragged her up the aisle into the vestry, -where, after the minister had left them, he said to her that that was nothiDg to what he meant to do. On the 8th of September he rushed into the room where she was about to take her breakfast, at Reading, and v,ith the assistance of his gardener, and followed by a police. iLspector, he violently dragged her into the passage and down the steps, and thrust her into a carriage, and drove her to his house at Burghfield, 'whereby her arms were so bruised and swollen that for ten days or a fortnight she was unable entirely to dress herself as she was acoustomed to do. She stated that, in order to save her life, she had made her escape and concealed herself for two years, and that she had received a letter from her husband, dated the 16th of September, 1857, in which, referring to the abduction of September, 1856, he said, "I will have a dozen nore, if necessary." In other respects the letter, which was set forth at3 lengtb, was expreesive of affection, and showed an earnest desire that she should return to her husband. The articles went on to state that the applicant was in daily fear that some act of violence would be comsnitted against her, and that her husband would do her somie bodily hurt. She therefore prayed that her husband might be ordered to find sureties to keep the peace. The articles concluded with the usual statement, that the appli. cant did not make the complaint through any hatred or ill-will or malice against her husband, but merely for protection of her life and person from bodily harm. Lord CAMPrBELL said, he thought that as the husband in his letter threatened a repetition of the violent abduction of his wife, instead of instituting a suit for the restitution of conjugal rights, she was entitled to the protection of the Court, and that the husband ought to be bound over to keep the peace. X.Justics COLERIDGE said, It did not appear that while the applicant was living in the house with her husband, he had done any act of personal violence or cruelty towards her. Mr. HUDDLESTON relied on the letter, which threatened her with another abduction, simUar to tbat which had rendered her unable to dress herself for ten days or a fortnight. Mr. Justice CoLeRIDGE and Mr. Jastice WIGIITrMAN expressed themselves In favour of granting the application. Mr. HUDDLESTON said, he believed the form was to apply for an attachment. Lord CAM1PBELL.-Lt an attachmnent Issue. The Court having disposed of the motions proceeded with the cases in the New T'rial Paper, but rose at 2 o'olook to meet the other judges in the Exchequer Chamber to prick for sheriffs. (Sitings at Nisi Prius, at GuiidlWl4 before Mr. Justwie ERLE.) NASH V. SALIsBntRY. Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Chernock were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Edward James for the defendant, This was an action for an assault and false imprisonment. The plaintiff (the son of a solicitor) was an actor, and on the 30th of March last he was performing at the Blackburne Theatre. When he was about to leave at night he was told by persons, who attended on behalf of the defendant, who was trustee for the landlord, that a distress for rent had been put in, and he was told that he had something in his pocket and could not leave. The plaintiff said the things he had in his pocket (his theatrical apparel, a wig, pair of stockings, and pair of shoes) were his own, an.d he should go out. The parties however refused to let him leave, and he was kept there all night until 2 o'clock the next day, when he was asked to sign an agreement not to bring an action; he refused, ancn then was allowed to leave. The other performers, upon giving up their bundles, were permitted to leave that night. [The plaintiff had on a former occasion, when manager of the Windsor Theatre, recovered damages for an assault committed on him by Lord Ernest Vane Tempest at the time that nobleman was endeavouring to force himself into the ladies' dressing-room.1 The plaintiff had an engagement to be in London on the followiug afternoon, which he was unable to keep on account of this detention. A balance was now due to Rogers from the defendant. No distress had been put in. The defence was that the defendant had let the theatre to Rogers, and one of the conditions was that no property should be removed until all rent was paid. On the night in question there was 61. due for rent, bat there was a special letting for this particular night for 31, and it was agreed that Mr. Rideal, a clerk to the solicitors for the proprietors of the theatre, should receive the money, but uponr his arriving at the theatre he found Mr. Rogers receiving the admission money. Rideal then got into the pay-box. and received 3Os. After the performances were over Rideal asked for the balance of rent, but he found the performers were endeavourin to take bundles away, and he told the plaintiff it he would leave his bundle he might go, but the plaintiff refused to do this, and therefore the doors were locked. Had he given up the bundle he might have left. The plaintiff said, "If you won't let me take the property you may keep me, and I'll stop for a week." The plaintiff, and the other performers were repeatedly told thst they might go, if they would leave the property belonging to Rogers behind them. In the course of the day Rides, acting upon the prnnciple of an empty house cing better than a bad tenant, told thenm they might go and take the property wlth them, and they went. Rideal and ttla bailfi~ had refreshments, of which they Asked the plain- tiff and the others to partake, but they refused to take any. tbing. The plaintiff and the defendant and several witnesses, were called in support of the two sides offhe case. Mr. Juatice ERLE, in surming up, said, thel verdict must be for the plaintifF, and it was for the jury to say what the amount of damages should be. The jury, having Srst retired, returned a verdict for the plaintiff,-damages one farthing. After the verdict was given hfr. Justice ERLE addressed the father of the plaintiff, who was his attorney in tho cause, and said he had considered well whether it would not have been 'his duty to do something which would have been extremely painfuL He had yesterday told him that he had received a telegraphic message from the plaintiff statingthatillness prevented his coming to London. He (the learaed Judge) had thought it right to order the facts to be put in an affidavit, and then an affidavit was made In which it was sworn only that the plaintiff could not attend. Hle prayed Mr. Nash to be cautious when he made stateo ments on which a judge was to act. TYBRELL V. TAPnLT. Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Charnock were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Skinner for the defendant. The declaration stated that the defendant falsely and deceitfully made a representation that the Eclipse Life Insurance-ottice was in a state of solvency, in consequence of which representation the plaintiffwas induced to take shares In the association, the defendant well knowing the representation to be false. The defendant pleaded that he at the time believed the representation to be true. The plaintiff was an old gentleman, who stated that he was about to bring out a work. He met the defendant at a publichouse, who told him that this Eclipse Life Association was the very best thing ever imagined or brought into existence, and that if the plaintiff took shares he would have the additional advantage of being a director, for which he would receive a guinea a-week. Upon that representation the plaintiff was indaced to take somo shares, for which he gave a bill of exchange for 281., which Je had ultimately paid. The concern had all turned out to be a bubble. It appeared that thA plaintiff had been a Lieutenant-Colonel in one of our regiments in South America. The plaintiff had been proposed and elected director, and had several times acted as sauch. Two balance-sheets were afterwards made out, but the books did not support either. In cross-examination the plaintiff denied that he had ever proposed to Mr. Bush that a piece of plate should be resented to hr. Taplin. Did not take a part in the Eclipse being sold to the Beacon. Had never canvassed for the company. The Beacon had also turned out a bubble. Did not know the other directors. He would not have taken the shares butfor the representationof Taplin. The defendant had induced hins and the other directors to put their names to a bill for 1561. in his favour, for money he said he had ad. vanced, he at the same time stating that he should deduct it out of the premiums as they came in. Taplin was treasurer, managig director, and trustee. Upon investigation it appeared that the directors were put down as having each 250 shares, but upon reference to the cashbook it appeared that they had only paid upon 50 shares each. The business of a year was not sufficient to pay the rent or the Eecretary's salary. The company in 1855 was in a state of insolvency, and the representation that the directors were highly solvent was a misrepresentation, and they had not taken the shares as represented. The defendant had represented to other persons that the company was doing more business than any other society in London. The defence was that ihe defendant had been the most unfortunate of all the shareholders, he having paid upon 500 shares, and it was contended that the statement of the plaintiff was incorrect. Thomas Taplin.-I am the defendant, and am an auctioneer. There was a company called the Eclipse, in 1853, of which I was a promoter. I originally had 250 shares and then took 250 more, and I paid upon the 500 at the time they were registered. I executed the deed of settlement, and am there registered for 500 shares of 101 each. A deposit of Is. was paid upon each share taken. Some of the parties failed to make good their calls. Mr. Justice ERLZ.-Isee that some of them only paid upon 50 shares instead of upon 200. Witness.-That must he the mistake of the secretary. The JuDGZ.-No ; but you were treasurer. Witness.-I bad nothing to do with the books. Our first secretary kept the books in a very novel and extraordinary manner. We were unfortunate in all our secretaries. The JuDc.n.-They kept the books badly, and thatto your knowledge 7 Witness.-I had nothing to do with them. I thought the accounts were properly entered in the book I banded to your Lordship. When the accounts were wound-up the directors Eaid they would rather take their own moneys and give me a bill for money I had expended for the company. The secretary charged me as if I had received the money. I kept n o account myself. I instructed my clerk to take vouchers to the secretary. Mr. Beck was one of the directors; he has now some appointment in Staffordshire. I knew at the time the directors gave me a bill for 1561 that they were making themselves personally liable. A debt was incurred to me, and after the bill was given the directors were to receive all moneys, and the bill was paid out of those moneys. I had previously received the moneys and deducted them to pay off myself. Before June, 1855. I had met the plaintiff. He said he had heard it was a good society, and he should like to have some shares. He called on me and said he would take shares with the intention of qualifying himself for a director. I asked him if he could assist the company, and he said, through his son, he could. He said it was not convenient to him to pay 261. I said he mght have 50 of mine. I told him the company owed me 20u1., which was a proof of my confidence in the company He said he was interested in a Chancery suit. He was to do extraordinary things for me in the sale of the estates. What MIr. Tyrrell has said of what took place between us is untrue. I attribute it to his age and his loss of memory. I did not say It was in a state of solvency or in a flourishim condition, or that he should have a guinea a-week. I told him it must depend upon the amount of business. The company would have succeeded if the directors had paid up their calls and acted together. The company owe me 120. now. The plaintifffirst introduced the subject to me. Captain Freeman, one of the directors, had his shares of me. I have now about 377 shares, upon which I have paid. The plaintiff made no complaint until I said the bill must be paid. In January, 1856, the plaintiff was in favour of the company going on, and not being transflrred to the Beacon. He had given me a bill for the shares, which was renewed five times. He has applied to me to lend him other sums of money. Cross-ex:amined.-The bil was in Braham's hands when the plaintiff was sued upon it. He had not discounted it. I don't know whether Braham sued in his own name or mine. Beck is related to me. I have put him into a house I had to dispose of. I had sold Beck up, and after that he acted as secretary to this company. He had 250 sbares; he paid the Is. upon all of them. I received all the deposits; hut I have nothing to do with the books. I was aware there was a resolution that the company should take back 200 of the 250 shares. I have no recollection that I lent Beck the shillings. I did not tell the plaintiff that we had a bank. I might have said our bank was to be the Union Bank. I won't answer whether I have been insolvent, it is an impertinent question. Mr. Bush.-I was a solicitor in Bristol. In 1855 I was a shareholder. The plaintiff frequently asked me to increase my shares, saying that he was a director, and had the means of knowing it was a good concern, and he intended to pro. pose a vote of a pieco of plate to Mr. Taplin. He frequently repeated this before many persons. I transferred my shares to Mr. Beck. Cross-examined.-I sold my shares for the full value. The counsel baving addressed the jury on behalf of their respective clients, Mr. Justice ERLE summed up. The Jury returned a verdiol for the plaintiff,-DIamages 281. 93.

COURTf OF EXCEQlUER, THURSDAY, NOV. 12. LN RE KNIPE. St:it- ni- 7g--r A Mr. VARTH renewed au application to strike the name of an attorney off the roU of this court on the ground of certain alleged acts of misconduct. The question was whether the Court would make the rule absolute, the Law Society, with which body the proceedings originated, not having been able to effect the personal service. Notwithstanding that great exercions had been made and inquiries instituted in aU possible places where the individual in question was likely to be met with, the rule had not yet been served, there being no doubt that he purposely kept out of the way. The COURT having expressed strong doubt as to the propriety of making the rule absolute under the cireumstances, Mr. GARTH stated that the name was a singular one, and there was little chance of the Court going wrong if the rule were to be made absolote. However, if they thought that it was right that such a person should remain on their roD they would of course discharge the application. Mr. Baron BRAZV ELL.-You assume, very erroneously, that the Court wishes to retain a person who is alleged to have been guilty of improper practice on the roll, of attor. neys. We wish to do no such thing. The CHIEF BARON.-It is no doubt a very wrong thing tbat an attorney should be allowed to practise as an officer of this court when he is shown tohaveabused thatprivilege, but it would be an equally wrong thing to strike an attorney off the roll for malpractices witbout proof of personal service. If it be necessary to make personal service of a rule calling on an attorney to answer the matters of an affidavit, it must be equally' desirable that the same strictness shoald prevail where it is sought to strike him off the roll. We must abdhere. to the usual practice, and refuse to make this Rule discharged accordingly. NEv TRsiL PAPER. GLAVX V. HARDING. This was an action by the lessee of two houses in New Oxford-street adjacent to the premises of the defendant, formerly known as the Royal Arcade, but now devoted to the purposes of a furniture repository, for interfering with the right of the plaintiff to air and light, aud aro for obstructing a right of way to his houses through the Areade. At the trial before the Chief Baron a verdict was found for the plaintiff on all points after a lengthened investigation, and this was a rule for a new trial On the ground that there was no evidence to go to the jury m support of the plaintiff's case, and that the Chief Baron had misdirected the jury. Sir FREDERiC TuEsIaGER (with whom were Mr. Hoggins and Mr. Ogle) ' was partly heard for the plaintiff in oppostion to the rule, when the Court rose to nominate sheriffs at half-past 1 o'clock.

INSOLVENT DEBTO}W Grnt 7k' , v> f2l RE LORENIZO FRAINCESCO ANTONIO IOSTEMERLI, COUNT DV SANDl)MrNTI (Befo,e Mr. Con ivuimt.r PITTT.TZTP. 1 This insolvent, described as a vocalist and manager of the E"mporio Italiano," petitioned under the Protection Act. Mr. Sargood supported. Three creditors opposed in person. One, Mr. Blake, who had let a furnished house to the insolvent at a rental of 1701. a-year, complained of injury done to his furniture, the insolvents man-cook having committed much damage among the kitchen fittings, but was not prepared with evidenee to sustain his complaint. Mr. Miles, a grocer, to whom 481. was due, said he had been induced to supply goods for two months by being paid in June an order upon the Union Bank payable in Augmt, which the insolvent's wife represented to be as good as cash. The order was not honoured, the bank having "no orders." This creditor also desired to prove some facts by his son, who was not presentk and the Court intimated that there would be another opportunity for the parties to appear. The third creditor was a poor man named Jones, who had been a servant to the insolvent at weekly wages of 10s., and who mow claimed 21. as due to him. The learned COMAnSSIONER thought that this poor man was a creditor who ought not to remain on the schedule. Mr. SARGOOD said before the next hearing the man should be paid. The 7th of Decemher'was then fixed for the final order.
POLICE. MAEiSION.HousE.:-EmiIy Sleath and Mary Cotter were brought before the LORD MiAYoR, charged with having robbed a gentleman's coachman in Cannon-street. The prisoners had been brought up on Taesday on the same charge, but the victim not having made his appearance, and the women having stated that the money found upon them belonged to their husbands, and that their accuser had been drunk when he made the charge at the statlon-house, they were discharged, upon the understanding that they would call at the Jastice-room yesterday for the decision of the Lord Mayor as to the money which they claimed as the property of their husbands-honest, hard-working men. After his LoRD=srp had disposed of a few cases the two women appeared, very smartly dressed, in the witness-box, for the purpose of receiving a halfSsovereign and 15s. or 16s., which had been found in their possessien, but, to their great chagrin, when the Lord Mayor asked whether any complatnant was present, John Wood, the coachman, came forwArd and said that he was the man who had been robbed, and that he had a witness to prove the fact beyond all dispute, and that the thieves were in his Lordship's presence. The LORD MAYOR (to the women).-This gives a very different complexion to the case indeed. Mary Cotter.-Oh, gracious me, did you ever hear the likes of it? How could I think of stealing? That money I got from my husband, who is now working hard in the docks. Oh such a false man! Wel, I never! John Wood.-I swear that you are the woman that thrust your hand into my pocket and pulled my master's money and my knife out of my pocket, and the other woman was with you at the time, and you both ran away and were caught by the policeman. Emily Sleath.-I know nothing at all about any robbery. I came here to get back the money which my husband gave me, and I hope your Lordship will order the officer to hand it over to me. The women were then placed in the dock, and the testimony of the witnesses was regularly taken by the chief clerk. It was proved that the complainant had been followed out of a publichouse in Cannon-street, in which he hadbeen drinking, by the prisoners, and that his money and his knife had been pulled out of his pocket in the m inner described by Cotter, who, together with her comninion, then ran away, pursued by him. Emily Sleath.-There is no proof that I took anything from him. The LORD MAYOR.-IJpon whom was the knife found? Policeman.-Upon Sleath, and 7s. or 8s. were also found upon her. Emily Sleath.-How the knife got into my pocket I am sure I don't know-Pm blessed if I do. The LORD MAYOR,-You must both go to Holloway Prison to hard labour for 21 days. Cotter.-Oh, look at that, now ! Well, but you will order me to have ray husband's money? Sleath.-And your Lordship will order me to have mine ? The Coachan,-My Lord there was more money found on them by some shillings than was stolen from me, and I won't have anYthing to do writh that. I he IORD 1Ayon (to the eoachman).-You shall have all the money and the knife of whioh you were robbed, and the rest of the money found in the possession of the prisoners shall be paid towvards their support ih the prison to hiohiC I consign them for 21 days with hard labour. The prioners, whose conviction the persons assembled ia the court witnessed with evident delight, were then removed to the cage below stairs. MALBOROUGH-sTREzT ..Josoph Smith was obarged on suspicion of stealing upwards of 1001. worth of silver plate from the house of a gentleman named Defries, No. 6, Eitzroy-square. The prisoner bad been allowed by the footman of Mr. Defries to sleep in his master's house, and this led to his being suspected and apprehended. Remanded till Tuesday week. William Burnett, Ellen Mills, and Mary English were charged with being conoerned with a police-constable named Sankey, now nnder remand, in stealing propertyt valned at upwards of 1,000l., belonging to a lady named Alkman. From the evidence of Police-sergeant Pottear, D 16, and Polioe-constable Joy, A 338, it appeared that, having received information, they went to No. 7, Earl-street, and knocked at the front room door at the top of the house. The door not being opened readily, it was broken open, and on entering they found Burnett and Mills in bed together. They told them they were wanted for being concerned in stealing a large quantity of property from 68, Great Portland-street. The prisoners replied they knew nothing abont It, and Bnimett denied all knowledge of Sankey. On being questioned Barnett said he had no watches and jewelry in the room. They pro. ceeded to search the place, and from Mlls took a purse containing 71. 14s. from one hand, and a gold watch from the other. The prisoner said the watch and the purse were her property. They went to the first floor and knocked at the door ofa roomwnich was opened by English They asked her ishe had anything in the roomthat was not her own. She replied she had not. The room was searohed and four sheets were found, which English declared had been in her possession for years. In Burnett's room some mere property was found by Joy, besides skeleton keys, a " jemmy,' and four melting pots, which had evidently been used for melting the jewelry and plate. lr. Hugh Robertson Alkman proved that the gold ring and watch found in Burnett's room were the property of his mother, and to the best of his belief formed part of the property under the care of Sankey, the constable. Mrs. Alkman identified the property produced. The prisoners were remanded til Thursday. The new evidence brought forward appears to corroborate to some extent the defence of Sankey-that some persons whom he invited into the house took aavantage of his being the worse for hquor and plundered it of the largest portion of the stolen property. - MRYrnBoxm-Bartolomeo Antonio, an Italian, was brought before Mr. LONG, oharged with the nuisance of playing an organ in front of the house of Mr. Charles Babbage, the well-kno-rnprofessor of mathematics, residing at No. 1 Dorset-street, Manchester-squaa Complainant, upon whose evidence several organ grinders have within the list three or four years been convicted of a similar offence, deposed that on the previous evening about 9 o'clock, while pursaing his studies, he was annoyed by the playing of an organ close to his dwelling. He desired hi servant to go out and send the plyer away, when, finding that the noiqe was still kept up, he went himself into the street and foumd that kis servant had given the ofrender (the rsoner) iato ucustody. He was almost daily interrupted in faprofessional pursuits, as were also other persons by whom he was assisted therein. Complainant's servant said that on tolling the prisoner he must go he intimated that hemust have a penny. A second request was made to him to depart, but without effeot, and Witnessthen gave him in charge of a constable of the D divsonwa The prisoner said, through an interpreter, that he did not understand the order given to him to moTe. He had been told by a person to play, and had received a penny for so doing. M.. LoNG remarked that for such a nuisanice as that complained of by a gentleman engaged in scientific studies requiring great calculatin ability, and which studies might be of great public benefit, he was bound to punish the prisoner for the offenoe which he had been guilty of, and accordingly fined him 20s., or 14 days in the HousEO of Correction, at the same time giving him to understand that if brought np again on a simillar charge he should be more severely dealt with. CLERWEN1.-The sitting magistrate requested our reporter to acknowledge the receipt of 12 postage stamps for the funds of the poor-box of this court, the donor asking for Its receipt in this journal. i

IBELAND. ( ov ul OWN c% SPnJ DUBLIN, THustsD 1v I PROSECrJTIOy OF TIl M&Yo PRIESTS. St was stated in TWe Mes of Wednesday that the rish Attorney-.eneral had filed aut e= officio inforniation against the Rev. Peter Conway, one of the Roman Catholic priests who figured at the last 'election for Mayo. Yesterday an information was fled agaiust the Rev. Luake Ryan, another actor in that memorable cosrtest. [t embodies charges neary similxr to those preferred against Mr. Conway, but the information against the former is shorter than the one filed against his rev. associate, Meanwhile, Mr. Fitxoerald must prepare to be roughly bandled for the bold gnd independent oourse he has taken in this matter. A fierce Tory journal (the Mayo ConstitutiOn)3 condemns in unmeasured terms the eriminal pro'ceedings instituted by the Irish Attorney-General agrainst Fathers-Cenway and Ryan. Ian this business Gov.ernment seems to stand in the ehoes of the i rish drummer oE old, who, whether he struck high or low, failed to please the party undergoinlg punishment :-" We -will not be accused," says the scribe, "O)f being sympathizers with disloyalty or nuconsti. tutional conduct, more espeoially when the nccused aro Roman Catho'lic priests, and we the more authoritatively spea", when we assert that a more frivolous pretext for 3 State proecution never existed, nor one whicb, from the cirumnstances of the oase, must result in mora utter discomfiture. It is to be deplored that this prosecution of ihose priests by a vacillating Governmient will have the effect of kdHng feelings of discord which are not warranted by this untoward aot; and, so far from the authorities having wrlling supprters in elevating lFathers Conway and Rtyan to the dignity of martyrdom, those who invariably stood by ' law and order' view with contempt this piece of wretched finesse, and sneer at the threatened vindication of 'nglish law' and the purity of election, when they remember that if these two hot-headed zealots are wortby of a State prosecntion for being guilty of intimidation and other misdemeanours at the late election, why two-thirds of the host of priests who figured at Mayo elections since 1829 should have been expatriated at the public expense. But let the prosecution be proceeded with by all means; it will affo'rd a precedent, and, in establishing that precedent, we doubt not that some of the fundamental rottenness on which political charactar was created and sustained -for years in S Alayo wll be exposed to a wondering pubLic. us not be understood as wishing to shield these p1iests from the consequerces of their acts; if they have been guilty of any infringement of the stalute or common law of the land let them be punished by Pll means, and that rigidly; but what we contend for is, that the prosecution of these priests is a mere ' Whig dodge ' to get up a cry, in order to cover the most disgraceful innovations on the constitutional liberties of the subject ever attempted by any admoinistration. We predict, however, the grand par.de of a State proseoution of these Irish priests will be the ' veriest shamn,' and that all will end in ' sound and fury, signifying nothing.' " ROYAL BANE OF IItLAiS. The annual general mceting of the shareholders of this concern was held yesterday in Dublin, Mr. Patrick Reed, the chairmnan of the company, presiding.

This favourable result is maainly attributable to the sound condition of the agricultural and commercial community and the absence of overtrading, combined with a prevailing rate of discount during the period embraced by the report, which,twhile beneficial to 'the employment of capital, was not embarrassing to either of the interests adverted to." The report was unanimously adopted, and the proceedinge were brought to a close. TIIB GREAT TEA SW0D1LE. The Belfast Nev'sletter gives the following as ."authentic" intelLigence of the escape of John James Moore:- " It is now certain that Moore, the perpetrator of the great tea robbory, has escaped. He ssiled in the Asia from Liv'erpool, and we have received intetUlgence of the mauner In which he eluded arrest at New York. A gentleman, who was a fellow-p ssenger by the Asia, gives the followingaccount of what took place. As soon as it was ascertained at Liverpool that Moore had succeeded in getting on board the Asia a telegraphic despatch announcing the eirdumetance was sent to Southampton, from which port the steamer Vanderbilt sailed for New York a' about 8 o'clock -the same evening. The Vanderbilt isa very fast boat, and, .making a rapid passage, got into New York 24 hounrs before -the Asia. The police officers were at once put on the qui vive, and they awaited the Asia's arival, certain of arresting the delinquent. The law not permitting them to go on board the steamer they placed themselves at the gangway to take Moore into custody as lie came ashore; but the tea gerius was too many for them. Aided by some of the crew -who were a little in his secret-he got ashore by the ship's bo*ksprit, and once away he was not readily discovered. His whereabouts was still a secret when our informant left Anmerica. Moore, having gone a second-class passenger, had the better opportunity during the voyage, by money and otherwise, of ingratiating himself with the sailors, and hence, probably, their useful aid at the critical moment." AGRICULTURE IN ULSTER. The monthly agricultural report of the Derrm Journal says:- " In a former report we intimated that the grain crops would reach about a fair average; since then we have been enabled to test the root crops, and here, we regret to state, ,there will be a great faliig off. The root crops of the North are nearly altogether embraced under the two denominations -potatoes and turnips-the cultivation of any other kind of bu boas plants being so limited as to ma;ke their success or failure of little consequence. The potatoes have been ralsed and stored; the great bulk of the produce is sound, but it wants a third of the quantity of the past two or three years. We have found no farms in this locality where a fuU crop has been procured. The severe existing pressure as regards monetary affairs has not yet affected tbe condition of the working classes. Employment still continues to be ample, and the wages of agricultural hands are at least 30 per cent. higher than th2y were 6fve years ago, at the same time that the food and necersaiies of life are no' at extravagant rates. The oldest and most confirmed 'croakers' have now to acknowledge that Ireland was never in so prosperous a condition as at present." A NEW ROMAN CATHOLIC BIsioP. The Cork.

Mr, Dykee was drivig in v.phaeton a horse tht he had on trial, when near Auetinfriars the animal atarted off. Mr. Dykes, fully retaining his self-possession, adroitly managed his horse so as to escape contact with several vehicles coming towards him, bat unhappily the horse, desperately swervfng at the aerner of Wincheeter-atreet, dashed the carriage against the Post with tremendous force, and poor Mr. Dgkes was throwiiout on the stones on his head.

OUR INDIAX GEVERALS. At the present moment, when the eyes of the nation arm so naturally turned to India, our readers will not think out of place the following brief sketch of our military ar,d civil commanders in India, as the raen on whom, humanly speaking, the fate of our Estera Empire at this important I crisis dependS, now that death hls deprived us of the services of such heroes as Sir Henry Lawrerce, Sir Hugh Massey Wheeler, Geceral Barnard, Major Banks, General Nicholson, and Colonel NleiU, to Esy nothing of a host of other less distinguished names. The supreme comrmand of all the forces, vwhether of the Line or of the Company's army, or of native troops, is of course, in the -hands of Sir Cohn Campbell, G.C.B., who, as our readers are aware, left England in July last, at some 24 hours' notice, in order to carry out the wisbes of Her Majesty in India as Commander-in-Chief. That well-known general, who is a scion of one of the many branebes of the Scottish clan of Campbell, was born near Glasgow, we believe, in 1792, and entered the army in 1808 as ensign in a foot regimen'. He took pert in the unfortunate expedition to Walcheres; and while serving in the 5th Foot, he had seen some hard fighting at Vimiera. He also took part In the advance and retreat of the army uLder Sir John Moore and in the Battle of Corunna, and was also engaged in the Battle of Barossa and in the defence of Tarifa. In the latter part of the year 1812 he was attached to the army of Ballasteros, and was present at several affairs of importance. Among others, he took part in the exDedition for relieving Tarragona, and was present at esma and Vittoria, and at the siege of San Sebastian' where he received two severe woands, and at the passage of the Bidassoa, where he was again severely wounded. In 1814-15 he saw some active service in America while holding a commission in the 60th Rifles, and in 1823 we find him acting as Briga de-MAjor of the troops engaged in quelling the insurrection at Damerara. In the expedition to China in 1842 Sir Colin CamipbeU commaDded the 98th Regiment, and took an active part in the capture of Chin-kiang-foo, and the sabsequent operations in the neighbourhood of Nankin. Nor is he without Indian experience. Throughout the Punjab campaigns of 1848-9 he commanded the third division of the army under Lord Gontgh, and distinguished himself niore particularly in the affair at Ramnuggur, the passage of the Chenab, the affair at Sadoolapore, at the battles of ChillianvaUah, where he was wounded, and at Goojerat. In 1851 and the following year, while Bzigadier-General in command of the Pesbawur districts, he was constantly engaged in most difficult operations against the hill tribes surrounding the valley, including the forcing of the Kohat Pass, under the late General Sir Charles J. Napier, and the repeated affairs against the Momunds, who were glad to come to terms after their defeat at Punj Pao by a small detachment of cavalry and Horse Artillery under Sir Colin Campbell's immediate command, the combined tribes numbering upwards of 8,000 men. In 1S49 he ras creat-ed a E.C.B., and received the thanks of both Parliament and the East India Conspany for his conduct at Goojerat. Ileturning to England in the early part of 1853, he was appointed, on the breaking out of war with Russia in the following year, to the commaud of the Righland Brigade, which, together with the brigade of the Guards, composed the division of the Dske of Cambridge. His gaUantry at the Battle of the Alma, at the head of his beloved Highlanders, and his zeal, intrepidity, and ability throughout the rest of the trying perils of the Crimean campaign, in which he was content to serve under men as muoh his inferiors as they were his juniors, were faithfully recorded in these columns at the time, and therefore do not need to be repeated here. Lord Gough, in his despatches written from the field of ChillianwaUah, speaks, if we remember aright, in the very highest terms of Sir Coln Campbell's "steady coolness and military precision" as "carrying everything before it;" and these qualities, added toa constantcareforthe comfort and lives of the troops under his command, have gained for him in the very highest degree the confidence, admiration, and affection of the mnany corps with which he has served in three of the four quarters of the globe, with but little intermission, during the past 50 years. Not being fortunate enough to possess the additional advantage of high influence at the Horse Guards, Sir Colin CampbeU found himself merely a Colonel at the ouitbreak of the Russian war, and it was not until the month of June, 1854, that he was gazetted a Major-General in the army. In the following October he was appointed to the colonelcy of the 67th Foot, and in 1855 promoted to the honour of a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath. In 1856 he attained the rank of LieutenantGeneral, and on Iiis return to England was presented with thefreedom of the City of London, and created an honorary D.C.L. of Oxford, in recognition of his Crimean services Sir Colin Campbell is also one of the Aides-de-Camp to Her Majesty. We feel that it is a long step from the able but plebeian General, Sir Colin Campbell, to "Ilis Excellency LieutenantGeneral Sir Henry Somerset, K.C.B. and E.H.," whom Sir Colin found upon his arrival acting as Commander-in-Chief. This officer comes of a duca. family. Sir Henry Somerset is a grandson of the fifth Duke of Beaufort, and consequentlynephew to the late Lord Raglan; being the eldeat son of the late Lord Charles Henry Somerset, by his first wife, a daughter of the late Viscount Courtenay. He was born in 1794, and entered the armyin 1811. He saw some active service in the Peninsular Campaigns of 1813, 1814, and 1815, including the battles of Vittoria, Orthes, Toulouse, and Waterloo. In 1838 he became Lieutenant-Colonel of the Cape Mounted Rifles, and took a prominent part in the Caffre war, for which he was rewarded in 1853 by being made a K.C.B. Having risen meantime thiough the various grades of promotion with more than the a7erage speed, we find him in 1851 a MajorGeneral in the army, and in 1853 he was placed upon the Staff at Bombay; in 1855 the local rank of LieutenantGeneral was conferred upon him. In February, 1855, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the East India Forces at Bombay, and second member of the Council in that Presidency; and in 1856 he was nominated to the colonelcy of the 25th Foot. On the 5th of June in the present year ho became, by the death of General Arson, Coinmander-in-Chief in India; but when the time for decisive action was come, and the "right man was wanted in the right place," the advisers of Her Majesty came to the conclusion that the chief responsibility of the suppression of the mutiny should be intrusted to the hands of Sir Colin Campbell, and we shall be the last to complain of the decision. His ExceUency Lieutenant-General Sir Patrick Grant, K.G.B., Commander-in-Chief in Bengal, to whom we come next, is a soldier of a different stamp; he is remarkable as being the only one of the Company's officers who has been allowed to hold that high and responsible poest, which has hitherto been reserved as a piece of political patronage at home. Sir Patrick Grant is one of the very many Scotchmen who have risen to high eminence in India. He is, we believe, a sou of the late Major John Grant of Auchterblair, Grant-town, in Elgin, and was born April 23, 1804, in the parish of Dathill, in that county; so that he is still in the prime of life, and has before him plenty of time for further exploits before we shall have to reckon him among our superannuated and disabled generals. He entered the military service of the East India Company in 1819, and July 20, 1820, was appointed to an ensigney in the 8th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. Having attained the rank of Captain in 1832, he saw some active service at Maharajpore, for which he obtained a bronze star and was made Brevet-MIajor in April, 1844. He subsequently served with much distinction through the carmpaigns on the Sutlej, including the battles of Moodkee (in which he was severely wounded) and at Sobraon, for which battle he received a medal and clasp ; at the same time he was made a Brevet-Colonel and a Companion of the Bath. He was also present with the forces inthe Punjab, where he acted as Deputy Adjutaut-General of the Bengal army. He subsequently took part in the passage of the Chenab (already referred to in our sketch of Sir Colin Campbell's career), and in the actions of Chillianwallah and Goojerat, for which he received the usu3a medal and clasps. Already in 1842 he had held the political, or rather the civil, appointment of Assistant-Collector in the district of Tinnevelly, and in 1844 he married the Hon. Maria Gough, fourth and youngest daughter of General Lord Gough, who was at that time Commander-in-Chief of the forces in India. Sir Patrick Grant is one of Her Majesty's Aides-deCamp, and was made a Knight Commandsr of the Bath in January last for his Indian services. His commissions bear date as follows:-Ensign, July 16, 1820; lieutenant, July 11, 1823; captain, May 14, 1832; brevet-major, April 30, 1844; major, June 15, 1845 . brevet lieutenant-colonel, April 3, 1846; brevet-colonel: August 2, 1850; lieutenant-colonel, August 2'J, 1851; and major-general, November 2S, 1854. In 1853 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal army, and obtained the local rank of Lieutenant-Generad in IndiaJanuary 25, 1856. Of Lieuteraut-Genera Sir Henry Haveloeck, K.C.B., ani his splendid achievements we havn recently given so complete a sketch that we venture to pass in to make mention of e * restof his colleagues in comn -ad-WfUson, ChambeL.: n,Va-. Cortlaudt, Outram, Edwardes, .,adJsoob, which 'we propo. .0 restune in oar next impression. Major-General Nicholas Penny, CaB., who has sauweeded General Wilson in the command of our victorious forces In Central India, is an officer of considerable standing in the army, and is now as nearly as possible 67 years of age. He is the son of the late Mr. Robert Penny, and was baptized in thle month of November, 1790. In 1806 he was nomi nati94 bh t .he 4Lst J, Ho,#dgtste a o a iR egt appoitmv,f to Bengal, and shortly after his srnval at Calcntta, towards the closa ot the same year, he pessed so excellent an examination in Persian and Hindostanee that he was presented with a gratuity of 1,000 rupees. Ile was gazetted to an ensignoy in the Bengal army in February, 1S07, and obtained his lientenancy, Dec. 19, 1812. 'Up to this time he had not seen much active service; but we find him in the army serving ini vepaul during tho war of 1814, 18L5. and 1816, as vell as in the Mahratta war of 1816 and the following year, under the Marquis of Hastings; he was also one of those who shared the Deccan prize money. In 1818 he distinguished himself at Gurra Kotah. In 1823 he came to Londoa on furlough, but, returning to India in I 1825, we find him accompanying the Cormmander.in-Chief I on service to Agra, and acting for a time as Deputy Quarterntastr-General with the forces near that city. In the same year he took part in the siege of Bhurtpore, and was thanked by the Commander-in-Chief for his services on that occasion. In the following year he was nominated m.ajor of brigade on the establishment, and appointed to the command of the Mnttra and Agra frontier. In 1828 he was appointed Deputy.AssistantAdjutant.General on the establishment, and also to the commaand of the Dinapore division, from which he was shortly afterwards removed to the Presidenoy at the express order of the Governor-General, the late Lord Wiliam Bentinck. The London Gazete of August 1, 1834, informs us that he was allowed brevet rank for his services in the field. In November, 1837, wefind him directed to take charge of the Adjutant-General's De- j pariment at the Presidency, from which post he was transferred in June, 1841, to the command of the Nusseree Battalion, for the efflcient drill and discipline, of which he was so frequently thanked by his superiors that his name became almost a by -word and a proverb for energy and activity. At the same time he was directed to act as Assistant-Adjutant-General at Barraekpore, in which capacity he was again reported as a " most zealous and efficient officer." In the Sutlej campaigns he com-maanded at first the 12th Brigade of the 5th Division, and the 2d Infantry Brigade on the breaking up of the 12th. He was present at Aliwal, where he was in the very thickest of the fight, and was thanked for his galLantry on the battlefield in the following terms by Sir [arry Smith, in his despatch addressed to the Governor-General, dated Aliwal, January the 30th, 1846:- "' The intrepid liitle Ghoorkas of the Nusseree and Sirmoor battalions in bravery and obedience can be exceeded by none. I much regret that I had no brigade to give to Brigadier Penny, who is in orders for one. I can only say that when he gets his brigade, if he leads it ashe led his gallant band of Ghoorkas, it will be inferior to none," He was againengaged at Sobraon, where he was wounded, and Sir Hugh Gough recommended him " in the most earnest manner" to the notice of the Governor-General for the spirited manner in which he and his gallant troop had over. come " the most formidable opposition." In the F,eptember following we find him appointed to the command of a brigade composed of Her Majesty's 53d Foot, the Nusseree Battalion, and two howitzers. At Chilianvallah, where he was engaged as a brigadier, he had another opportunity of distinguishing himself; for, though his brigade was held in reserve, he was enabled to supporb the advance of Sir W. R. Gilbert, and to carry a village, which was " the key of the enemy's position," by " a most spirited attack, executed in a brilliant style.' It should be added that Sir W. Gilbert, in his despatch, drew attention to his "most valuable' services on this occasion. Brigadier Penny received the medal for Aliwal and Sobraon, and was gazetted a C.B. in the following month of June. He was also made an honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor-General. In February, 1849, he was removed from the 6th to the 3d, and subsequently to the 2d Brigade of Infantry belonging to the army in the Punjab, from which he was again zemoved to the command of the 3d European Regiment. IR 1848 we find him commanding a division of infantry in the Punjab, and in the following year in command of the troops at Lahore. In 1851 lie was appointed to the brigade staff and posted to the distriet of Rohileund. He was subsequently removed to Umballah ; in 1852 he was appointed to command the Jullundur field force, to which, later in the same year, was added the command of the Sirhud division. In 1853 he was transferred to the Scinde Saugor district, and in 1854 to Sealcote. About the same time he attained the rank of major-general. In May, 1855, he was appointed to the temporary divisional staff of the army, and posted to the Cawnpore division. At the last dates from IndLa he held the command of the Meerut dividion, which, according to the Quarterly Army IHsi, of the Bengal establishment, was the headquarters of the Artillery, both horse and foot, and included the 3d LiRht Cavalry,tho 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabineers), the first battalion of the 60th Rides, and the ilth and 20th Regiments of Native Infantry.
TaF FkAILnMS OP SOLDIERS SBVrScG IN I.DDA -There is some reason to apprehend thar in many parts of the country, and especially in garrison towns, the wives and families of soldiers who have embarked for ,ervice in India are in many cases sufferinggreatprivation. The Rev. Daniel Cooke, a clergyman residing atChatham,has recentlywritten a touching letter, which appears in a local newspaper, to Mfr. Alfred B. Sheppard, of 18, Lincoln's-inn-fields describing the misery which has come under his own eye anong tho wives and families of soldiers left bebind in this country, and soliciting his aid In procuring subhcriptiocs from the charitable and humane towards its alleviation. Mr. Cooke asks :-" Would it not be possible for you to do something for my poor soldiers' wives and famllies among the good people of Torqaay?" (MIr. Sheppard was then staying there.) " The distress experienced by these poor creatures is dreadful. Those who have been imprudent enough to marry without military leave get nothing; this, I am sorry to say, constitntes a large class. Those who are married with leave are allowed 6d. a-day, but inany have to wait two months before they get a farthing; and however niany in a family they get no more than the 6d. per day. My payments now to the poor families of those brave fellows who have gone forth to India amount to 10;. per week, and in no case do I give more than 3s. a-week to one family. At this rate my ltttle stock will soon be exhatisted. If only kind friends at a distance could hear the tales of woo which I am oblfged to hear, the soldier's wife and child would not want. It is bad enonch that they should be suddenly deprivel of their husbans. wyhom in many instances they may never see again in this world, but when poverty in addition comes OR it is bad indeed. MIany of these poor women havs EU ed respectable situations as servants, and never knew what w,ant was, and would rathersuffer than n- :e it known. A ycng woman came to me Inst Tuesday with a child at her breast, with scarcely a shoe to her foot and no shawl iw covtr h,- or her Infant. bhe had lived rpon her clothes _ :e Fer husband left, and appeared too b.okenhearted to look orask for selief. A soldier called upon me last week,bringing : finelittlebov telling me his comrade had just ,anexpectedly i',en seat to India with the draught, and hbd left his chile ia his car the poor hoy's mother having died some ' r, onth;, agAmong other plans I purpose adopting if pih. these noor women is the establishing a nursery Jant homefor their children. Soine of the nilitr tro :tors have kindly promised me worqk, and if I h - .c -!"where the infant children could he tae * ; :u mothers might d'> much to b - support themarn -, but none of these things r . ue without money. During the last war I drew i,2001. for soldiers' wives fromn the Central Assc.-iation, and from tho beginning of the ermbarcations to the present time I have only received Wit. Surely a gratefuI country will not starfi by and see the wives and families of men who have gonetofiglgttheir battles in adistant land, at a great crisis in the national history, struggle against poverty and want without stretching forth a haud to ralieve and comfort them I Ho iv much will it nerve the arm and inflame the courage of the brave soldier in the din and confict ot war to kssow that the dear ones he has left behind hisn are cared for and protected by a generous nation; but hows, oo tbe other hand, will his heart sink within hia if he ndtbrat tIhey Al?. £iYQ1 Qyore tf QlWt sitd =Le? 1"
