FIlANCIAL RBSUL,T OF THE ARr TBEASUBRS RXHIBZTION. A general meetin of the guarantee subscribers to the lats Art Itreasures Exhibition waz convened by the executive committee onWednesday, atl2 o'clock, in,the Mayor's parlour, Town-hall, Manchester. The maeeting was oaLied by circular. [Our correspondent is indebted for informstion of thetime of meeting to one of the guarantee gubscribers.] There were psesnt at the meeting Messrs. James [ley wood, Edmunad Buckley, Oliver Hey wood, Joseph Whit worth, Robert Bazbour, Stephen Heelis (Mlayor of Salford), J. S. Stern, W. Entwisle, Edward Loyd, ThoraaLs Ashton, Edmund Potter, JTames Dnlgdale, and other guarantee subscribers. M. Kissel, Belgian Consul, was also present. Mr. Thomas Fairbstrn. chairman of the executive committee, in the absence of the MAyor, presided. Colonel HAMINLTol;, secretary to the Art Treasures Committee, read the following report : "Tiks Executive Commnittee avail themselves of the earileit oppor tunity to subunt to you a preliminary report ~pon the tinancia result of the, Exhibition which closed on the 17th inst. ; sud, In aocorlanoc with the terms of the resolution of the meeting held in the Town.har I On the 20ib day of Msy, 1886. which devolvedA upon the genor il body of subscrber the final disposal of tke Exhibition buildingr, and the aPPropriation Of any surplus which milght arise from 'be undertaking no0w seek from you such additional powers as will enable them to reaizse the property and close ali the accounts In the shortest po3eible tires. The Exhibition w.e kept opea durxing 142 daya. of which twoon the oscasion of the opening and the pablic riait of Her Idajesty the Queen-were sesered for the holders of two guinea season tickets, and on the remainder the public were admitted by plyyment at tho doorg. " The total nuimber of paying tisitors reacted l,n53.538. The season tickset holders of bothL clases availed themselves Of their privileges ti enjoy 282,377 visIts, making the total number of rvisitors 1,335,915. " Up to the public close of the lixhibit;oo on the 17th instsant the nash recePts from all sources atanding to the c-edit of the committee ma be stated at £95,50. Tbe total expenditure up to the saws period, and the furthes liabgitlts whica are defigltirely known to the oommittee, suchL as oset of pollee to the end Orlovember, insurnce or all kin4s,frenil, ko., amount to £99,feQ. The stil further oudtlay to bs Incurred, inoludes all the expenses of returning the esntnibutioa, to their respective owners. " It willbesen at ouce thatIt wold be impoeeible at the present moment to give anything more than this approximate statement of Our fsnancial Position. To meet this excess of expenditure over the nlas receits we liars the Exhibition huliding and Its fittings. "Some time since thle committee aunouned, hy advertisement, that they were PrePAred to receive offers for the building an it stands Th'is advertisement has not called forth at preseat a single0 reply, and a reslution will therefore bo submitte- for your adoption., which wil enable the committee to take such steps as they na, consider expedent for the prompt realization of your pro~erty. "Without semmitting themselves to any promise, the committee are Of opinon that the figures in this report wiU satisfy Yen that the gauaantee fond will remain untouched; and that at some fuature PoslodL You wil be called upon to decide upon the appropriation ofa surplus in such manner as, We truit, WM commemorate the Art ra sues Exhibitioni of 1817. ",On behalf of the Etxecutive Committee.", Mr. THOMAS FAMBcAniR, in moving the first resolution, sald,-Gentlemen, before we have any discussion upon the the report which has just been read, we have, I conceive, one paramount duty to perform. The resoluLtion which I hold in my hand is one which Iam gure you willall agree with me should have precedence in our proceedings. It is to this effect :- " That thin meeting, as well on behalf of the immediate promoters and supporters of the Exhibition of Art Treaurers of the United Kingdoma, As the city of Manchester, wher that exhini1t[on was held, and the vast thousnuds of all ranks and couwtries who have enjoyed its beauties and benefited by its lessns, records Its sense of profound gra, tituLde for the existence of that socia harmony in this countey whims alone rendered such a gathering possible. It acknowledges for the country akt larg the munificent liberality and disinterestedness or the contributors, whether in the highest or the humblest ranks of itfa, belie,ring that one and all were moved in tbeir decisions by a sincere sympathy fOr a gret and refining work, and by an honest desir to Improve and gratify their fellow-cretatres", Often as I have meditated upon the Probable influence suad results of the undertaking of the Art Treasures Exhibition, wkich has Occupied so much of MY owvn time and thoughts durig the past 18 months, I confess I have never recurred to tematter 'without foeelng deeply' thankful for that happy change in public feeling which is referred to in the first part of the reslution. (Rear, hear.) Twenty, years ago such an undertaking woald have been altogether inipco. dible. At that time Manchester, with its vast populal ion, and considerable power from its manufacturing industry, had onlY Just achieved a political existence. (Cheers.) The town itself, its, people., and andl inuenoe -were referred to with something like a sneer of contempt. Happily such feelings are now obliterated for ever. (I" Hear, hear,' and applause.) The Exhibition which we have just held has not only afforded rational enjoyment and the op. poziunitY of intellectual improvement to a large portion of the community, but it has brought about a freer intercourse, a kidndlier feeling, and a morejust mutual appreciation between opposite though not antagonistc classes of our countrymen. (EHear.) It has brought the repreentatives of the htteditar-y interests of the countrY to Manchester; they have been brought fwac to face with its inhabitants ; they have heard their wrelcome and enjoyedI their hospitality, and seen something at least of their habits of life, and I believe also that all these matters have been, extended to them on one part without the sacrifice of one jot Of that manly independence which I hope has always characterized and will always continue to distinguish out conducat in all plitiosl, soial, and religious matters. (" Hear, hear," ankd eheerl.) Another benefit which I hope wil be made manifest in counexionl with this Exhibition will be found among ourselves. I hope it will be i'mpressed upon the minds of us all that it is inot incomapatible 'With tho succelfnl Pursuit of trade and the exciting speua tions of comnmerce to have an aPPreciation of the b eotauil and the chaste. (Esear, hear.) Such feelings will merely be found to -ador more agreeable ouLr houses and mnore useful and enjoyable our lives. The reolution further expresses the thanks of the whole commaunity for the munificent liberality which has characterized the conduct of all the contributors to the Art Treasure Exhibition. Where every one has been animasted by the same feelings it would be invidious to draw distictions, but I am sure youL will all agree with me that It would bo ungracious to omit especial acknowledgments to those who were our earliest, as they have been our best friends-I muean Her Majesty the Queen and his Royal Highness the Prince Consort. (Cheers.) Theirs was no mere lending what was superfluLous to themselves ; all the Royal palaces, for picture, Plate, china, and works of ornamental art generally, were unreservedly, thrown open for selection to the executive committee of the Exhibition. Nor can I think that Manchester will ever forget the specia compliment paid to the city in the manner and occasion of the vist of Her Majesty to soothe Exhibition. (Cheers.) Then, gentlemen, if we are caled upon thus to express our thanks to those at a distance who have contributed so largely to the undertaking, I cannot forget that thanks are also due to those nearer home. We have been fortunate enough to secure the service of most zealous officers. The zea and talent shown by Mr. J. C. Deane, for example, has met with the most hearty approval of the executive committee;nand I consider we may congratulate outrseve i having obtained the services of Colonel Hamilton, Who, In addition to strict business hakbits, has made himself agreeable to all the visitors with whom he came into communication. To the various heads of departments who arrnged the Exhibition our thanks are also dlue, and oven in the more humble offices there are certain men who have won the esteem and regard of those who have been their temporary employers. In conclusion, I must say that I should not be doing justice to my owvn feelings if I were to sit down without referring to those excellent friends whom you associated with me inL the immediate management of the Exhibition. At the earliest of our meetings they ~were goodl enough to place me in the honourable position of their chairman, No man can ever speak as I can do of their zeal and devotion, or of the disinterestedness of their service. The remnarkable harmony and kindly feeling which has existed throughout our numerous meetings, theirconstaut encouragement under many shortcomings of my own will dwell gratefulyn y meor s long aslIlive ; andlI sincerely hope tat the sincere esteem and regard which they now feel to myself wil never be forfeited by any act of may future lIf e. Mr. . W rrwo.Tusec-onded the motion, and it was carried unanimously. Mr. 0. HEYWOOD moved the next resolution, which he did with especial pleasure, because It was a confirmnation of those full powers which about 12 months ago they placed in the hands of the executive committee, when they undertook the mnanagemuent of an exhibition which they felt would be a distinguished honour to the city if succesif oily carried out. They felt confidence then that if the matter was placed in their hands they wouald be capable of carry. ing it to a successful issue, if success could be attained. The resoluition he ha to propos was one which all would coincide in, for it was simply to give the committee full power to dispose of the building in any way they might think- proper. This was not the time, and he would not take upon himaelf the gratification which would belong at a future time to the Inhabitants of the city, to express publicly their aclmowledgments to the committee for the services they had rendered, hut he could not forbear to tAke that opportunity of saying how gratified he had been from the beginning to the endl with the business habits which had been displayed to the credit of Mfanchester. With noneof he aranemens trougouthadthere beenL reason to indfaut o obecton.To he ontibuorsa great debt of rattud ws oing bu t th excutvewas due the graitue o al fr te uccssfl crringoutofthe great undetakng,andthepubic gnerllywoud areewithi him *That full powers be hereby asin to the executive committee to dispose of the Exhibitton building and it fittings in any way they may think proper.' This was seconded by Mr. J&AMrcs DUC,DILg, and carried. Mr. LOYn raid, after what had fallen from Mr. Heywood in acknowledgmnent of the services of the committee, he felt bound to express his complete and hearty concurrence in those observations. He had nowr to ask them to agree to a resolution which had been placoed in his bands, wvhich was:- *That a sun not esoeeding £1,000 be placed at the dlsposal or tho executive oommittee, to be used by them, at their discretion, shou! I they deem it desirable to recognize the services of the officera of the committee.B (Cheers.) Mr. Fairbairn had assured them of the extreme zeal which had been displayed by the officers, and it was only a proper compliment to put them in power to re. cognize those services as they saw fit. There was no gentle. man in the room who had not personally, upon different occasions, profited by the zealous and courteons services of the officers at the exhibition. He had derived such benefits frequently, and was glad to have a public opportunity of aeknowledging them. (Cheers.) Mr. E. BucKLEY seconded the motion, and said, be had had many friends to visit the Exhibition, and they had aU gone away delighted. They had previously no idea that there were such weil Paved streets and that every thing was so comfortable in MIanchester, and they blad formed a different opiniotn of the city to what they had previously enter- The resolution having been passed, Mr. J. WHITWORTH asked the chairman what was the present position of affairs with regard to the Soulages collection s The CEIM"T1Ntl said, Without going into the Circumstances which led to him and his colleagues coming into poasuobe of the collection, he ought to state that certain condiUons were attached to the parchase, and it was deuirable that those conditions should be thoroughly understood by th. public of f anchester. When the collection was purchsed t ws for tbe purpose of securing it for public exhibitlons and instruction, alnd no individual had power to dismember the collection. The terms on which they now held poemsion of it were thee ;-tbat, until the expiration of 28 dayar after the close of the Exhibition of Art Treasures, the corporation of Manichester, or any other person desirous to" ptrehase the collection entire for purposes of permanent; publio exhibition and instruction in Manchester,and whowill: engage to devote it to such and no other parposes, shal have, the pre-emption for the sum of 14,1751. And in the event, of such pre-emiption not being claimed within 28 daTs, and the contract of purchase not being signed, the President of the Committee of Her Majesty's Privy ')ouncil of Education. shall then have the option of purchasing the collection entirem for pablic purposes at the like sum during the next 28 days. If not then disposed of, tb en he and the Manchester manager6r shall have 'be fqrther right to purchase it between them in, equal portions at any time during 14 days. If the, whole or only half of it be parchased within that time, then the collection or remaining half shall besold by auction in London not later than June, 1858_ He felt desirow; that the position the committee stood in, should be clearly understood by the city at large. Somedecision must be come to soon, as they were bound by the, 15tb of November to offer the collection to Government it no other arrangement were Inade in the meantime. An, arrangement had been made with the counoil of the Royal Institution, by which two rooms would be set apart for the exhibition of the collection, which would be arranged in thecourse of a week or ten days, so that the public would have, an opportunity of seeing the collection again, when it was not saurronded by so many objects of equal beauty as it wau at Old Trafford. The MAYOR of Salford said,'he was not in a position to syanything upon the subject of the Soulages Collection, bht hethought there ought to be a strong expression of feeling with regard to the deep debt of gratitude they owed to thecommittee. Mr. Fairhairn then vacated the chair, which was take by Mr. Loyd. The MAYOR of Salford then said, he considered they were under Immense obligations to the Executive Committee, and he thought they would hereafter ehink ill of tbemselves it they separated writhout giving a forcible expression to tha;t feeling. What might hereafter be done was 6another ques. tion, but at present he should satisfy himself with proposing the following resolution: "That the watrnest thanks of this meeting be renderd to the' Executive Committee of the Art TreassB xblxbltion for tbeir onwearied exertion,in firtberane o tbe Exbibition, and the admable marver in which they have carried out thedesignsof itt motes." This was seconded by Mr. JAMES HEY WOOD, and carriec by acclamation. Mr. BARBOUR hoped there would be a more general espression of feeling with reference to the debt of gratitude which the city of Manchester owed to those gentlemen whecomposed the committee. They owed to them a debt of gratitude which could never be repaid. He trauted, whern the proper time came, sonething more subgtantial would bo suggested as a memorial of the feeling which they all expe. rienced for the indefatigable exertions of those gentlemen. It was thought at one time that the city of Mancheser could not get up such an Exhibition, bat they had sue. ceeded, and had excited the admiration and surprise of the strangers who had visited it, who were all ready to beartestimony to the unwearied exertions, the active labours and the sound wisdom they had shown in the undertaking. Mx. FAIREuRNr briefly acknowledged the vote, and Mr. BucKLEY assured them that the members of the executivestood 100 per cent. higher in the estimation of the public than they did before the Exhibition. Mr. 0. HEYWOOD thought something ought to be done promptly with regard to the Soulages Collection. It wasonly right and courteous to the executive that the matter should be taken up with spirit by the citizens, and some, decision come to. After a pause, no suggestion being made, the meeting, concluded.
RELIGIOUS LIrERZT IN TURKEY TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI3IES. Sir,-The actual state of the Turkish law on the question. of religious liberty it is not very easy to determine. The firmans granted on the subject are about as explicit as Delphian oraoles-at least, when interpreted by the Sheikh.elIslam at Constantinople, or the judges in the provinces. la England it is generally believed that complete religiousliberty has been established, and that Mahomedans by birth as weU as Christian renegades are now free to embrace Christianity; but in Tnrkey it is just as generaly believed that the law pronouncing death on the apostate is stiUl ia force so far as the former dass are concerned. Most people who know Turkey will admit that the real nature of her laws can only be ascertained from a study of her practice; and so the interpretation of the firmans which have been thought to guarantee liberty of conscience must be sought for in the decsions given in such cases as may arise. The. foUowing case, therefore, has a peculiar importance at thepresent tine, and I would beg to lntroduce it, under the powerful patronage of The Timas, to the attention of all interested in Turkish affairs. Some 22 years ago a Christian man and woman of Nebk, a village 40 miles north of Damascus, embraced Islamism in. order to contract an llUegal marriage. They had sub6e. quently a family of four sons and a daughter. It was waeU known that the change of faith was only nominal. The father did not frequent the mosque or unite with the Maho. medans in their prayers, and the sons, as they grew up, fre-. quently attended the Christian church. Five yars ago the father died, and on his deathbed expressed his abhorrence of the act he had been led to commit. With his last breathi he solemnly intreated his wife and children to, return to Christianity. Since that time the family have made several attempts to be formally recognized by some section of the Christian church, but the clergy declined to recelve them through fear of the law. A branch of oar smldon was recently established in Nebk, and application was made to the Rev. Mr. Ferrette, the superintendent, by Khalil, the eldest son, now 21 years of age, and subsequently byAbdu, the second, for admission into the Protestant church. Mr. Ferritte consented to give them religious instruction, which they received with great eagerness and thankfalness. He then consulted me regarding the propriety of further procedure. I stated that as religious liberty had been guaa ranteed by a hatti-sherif to all classes of the Sultan's eabjects I considered we were legally entitled to receive the young men into our communion. On Friday, the 2d inst., a Turkish officer ciUed Aly B9r arrived in Nebk. EHe heard the story, and Immediately ordered the Sheikh of the vilage to seize Khalil. The order ws obeyed, and the young man was dragged from his house at night to the presence of the officer. His armsand handg were then bound togother between pieces of wood, and his legs secured by a heavy chain. This being done, the Bey demanded of what religion e was. " I am a Christian,' was the reply. The Bey struck him repeatedly wlth a heavy karbaj on the bare hands and arms, and commanded him, under pain of death, to declare himself a Moslem. His onlY answer was, " I am a Christian, my father was a Christian, my grandfather was a Christian, and if you should cat m' head off I shall die a Christian." He was again severely beaten by the Bey and two soldlers, and then brought in chains to this city. Mr. Ferrette came to Damascus and reported these facts to me. Abdu, the second son, accompanied him, and took refuge in my house. The mother, with her two other sons and daughter, soon followed. On the 5th inst. I drew up a statement of the facts, and presented it to our acting oonsul, Mr. Misk, requesting him to use all his influence to have Khalil liberated. Mr. Misk at once saw the importance ot the case, and forwarded my statement to the Pasha, accompanied by a protest against such an act of persecution. To this the Pasha has not as yet condescended to reply. Khalil, on being brought to Damascus, was at first comaitted to prison; but he was almost immediately taken tothe barracks, enrolled as a soldier, and placed under close guard. At the hours of prayer he was dragged by force to the ranks, and ordered to join the others ia their prostra. tions. He replied that he was a Christian. He was beaten, and even threatened with death; but his uniform answer was, "I am a Christian and I shall die a Christian." Oa Saturday last, the 10th inst., Mr. Forrette met Rhalil in the street, escorted by two soldiers. Theyoung man complained bitterly of the treatment he had received, which he was able to do the more freely as the soldiers did not understand' Arabic. Mr. Ferrette walked with him until he arrived opposite the door of the British Consulate, and then said, "If you wish to escape, now is your time. Run into that house and you are safe." Of course he took the hint; and Mr. Misk at once received him under the protection of the British flag. His mother, brothers, and sister Isent to joinM him, and we wait with much anxiety for the result, which. I hope to be able to commiunicate to you by next mail. I am, &a., J. L PORTB. Damascus, Oct. 129.

SThe first transactions in Consols were at 88? to i, at ,which they remained till about the middle of the -day, when a continued demand for Stock on the Jart of the public caused a rise to zilk. From this "there was a partial reaction, and the concluding jprices were, 88 to 89 for money, and 89 to & for the 10th of November. Bank Stock left off at -206 to 208; Reduced, 88 to i; Newv Three per Qenta., 88k to i; India Stock, 208 to 21l ; India Bonds, 45s. to 35s. discount; arid Exchequer-bills, '1s. to 10s. discount. In the Stock-Exchange, owing to the purchases -for investment, money was abmirulant on Governenent securities at from 4 to 5 per cent. In the -discount-market and at the Bank of England there -was a full demand. Foreign stocks were steady, the only change being, a fall in Grenada. The transaction.s marked on the -official list were in Chilian Six per Cents., at 10l ; D)anish Five per Cents., 102; Gruriada New Active, 18; Portuguese,43 and 431 ; Spani-h Deferred, 25O; 'Turkish Six per Cents., 87 A; ditto Four per Cents. OGuaranteed, 97T; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 63 ; and the Four per Cents. Certificates, Y7. The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on ,the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 5c. for rnoney, and 67f. for the end of the monith, showing :an improvement of a quarter per cent. About 26,000l. in gold wvas w ithdIrawvn from the :Bank to-day for exportation. Russian gold to the amount of 42,0001. arrived to-day, and haa been sold for exportation to the 4Continent. A further sum of 84,0001. is expected. it is said that the Bombay advices just received statethat 270,0001. had been subscribed in that presidency to the new Government loan, and that the total would have been considerably larger but *or the fact that about 300,0001. in silver and gold had been despatched to Calcutta, chiefly by native 4nerchants, in consequence of the low prices of securities in that inarket. The bullion in the Bank -of Bengal had experienced a, further reduction of 190,0001.; but these consigntnents from Bombay, together with the gold to arrive from China and 33ngland, would be likely in a short time to produce .a great improvement. The announcement made yesterday that the Western Bank of Scotland at GAlasgow would receive full aid to meet any difliculties thst might arise frorn the recent failures in that city and America has been formally confirmed. This is the most satisfactory circumstance that could have transpired at the present moment, since the question has been -one of the chief subjects of anxiety during the past few weeks. The deposits of the bank are reported -to amount to about 6.000,0001., and in addition to the head office at -Glagow it has about 100 -branches and sub-branches. It is said that one of the conditions on which this arrangement has been *undertaken is that the establishment shall ultimately be wound up. All expectation of a resumption by the Liverpool Borough Bank seems to be at an end, but the Liver.pool letters this morning express confidence that no ,other banking difficulties of any importance will arise. According to some accounts, the Borough Bank contemplate that an examination of their assets should be made by some of the leading shareholders, and that if the result should be satisfactory as far as regards the ultimate sufficienicy of the assets to meet all liabilities, promissory notes should be issued to their depositors, so as to mitigate as far as possible the inconvenience to these parties by furnishing them with documents which may be negotiable. The amount of specie for the East by the mail steamer of the 4th of next month is not expected -to exceed 900,0001. The Scotch papers announce the suspension of Mr. James Condie, writer, which took place at Perth on Friday last ; the liabilities are estimated at 180,0001., and it is feared the assets will realize only 2s. Gd. in the pound. Mr. John Bright, lately chairman of the Hull Flax and Cotton Mills Company, was yesterday committed to take his trial for forgery. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day evidence was given in support of the seriotus charge against Mr. §amuel Adams, the bankrupt banker of Ware and Eertford, of baving fabricated untrue accounts and concealed a sum of 3,5001. from his creditors. A summons was issued for his appearance at the court on Thursday morniing to meet the complaint. Subjoined is the Act passed by the Senate of Pennsylvania on the 9th inst. for the protection of the suspended banks in that State, and also of a certain class of debtors. One of the concluding sections contains the satisfactory proviso that the necessary arran-ements are to be made for the payment in specie0of the intcrest of the public debt. WVith regard to the New York banks, it appears that iuder the new constitution of that State the Legislature have no power to legalize the suspensioln of specie payments, and it is to be presiuned, therefore, the dificulty will have to be got over by somre geneual agreement and an alteration perhaps in the wording of the notes:- " AS PASSED SENATE ()c-'. 9,1857.

In recent Sydney papers it is alleged that the total shipments of wrool from New South Wales for the year ending the 15th of November, 1857, were not likely to amount to more than 50,900 bides against 63,354 bales in the preceding year. The falling off is attributed to a contagious sicknes3 among the sheep in the southern and western districts, to floods in the Moreton Bay and other northern districts, and to the large exportation to the Melbourne market to supply the population with meat. The rise in the price of wool, however, has compensated producers for the diminished clip. Annexed is another communication on the delay in the publication of the Bank accounts:- ' Sir,-I am glad again to see you exert your powerful pen to obtain the Bank returns at an earlier period, and I hope and trust you will not cease until they are posted at tht; Bank at 11 o'clock on Monday morning. That it is quite possible to be done we know from the last two weeks' experience, the directors baving upon each Monday raised thbi rate one per ctnt., and why should they or their friends have a monopoly of the information? When the Bill was passed we had not our present railway or telegraphic communications with the distant provinces, but It the branch banks are to be continued as an excuse for the delay let us have the balances only of the head-office on Monday and the country branches on the succeeding day, the intention of the Act being that the public should be put in rossession of the knowledge es soon as the Bank could give iv, and not that it should be kept back until nearly a week has elapsed. Though the branch banks forrm an integral part of the es8ablishment, they ought to be treated as separate private banks and their individual returns given, as they are only int-nded to answer the deficiency of circulation caused by the failure of the country private bankers and the expansion of manufactures in their particular districts.

BAIL WAY COLLISIOVS. TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The sad accidents which have once more become frequent and the deep stake which the public have in the safety of railway travelling may excuse any one, however unprofessional, for offering any suggestions which appear to him conducive to an object of such great social importance. Your kindness in the insertion of my previous letter suggesting a proposed remedy for the danger of lateral oscillation, so fatally illustrated in the Great Northern accident, encourages me to hope that I may find a place in your columns for the following remarks on a kindred subject. They refer to the other chief risk of railway travelling, more frequent and more fatal in general than getting off the line-direct colision, of which a painful specimen has just occurred on the South Wales Railway. It seems to me that there is a method, simple in conception, and by no means of great mechanical difficulty, by which this danger may be reduced within much narrower limits. As I have no pretensions mvself to mechanical skill, and no aim but the public benefit, I wish to bring my idea, throu^h your widely-read columns, under the eyes ol others whose ingenuity might give it a more thorougbly practical form, and who, from their position, raight persuade some of our railway companies to give it a fair trial. Let me start, as before, from a few simple data. A speed of 64 feet per second is the same as43 7-llths, or nearly 44 miles an hour, and may be taken as nearly the full average speed of an expresb train. It is thevelooity a falling body acquiresin -swo seconds, or a pressure equal to the weightof the train must act steadil for two seconds to bring it to rest. 3nt the friction when irou slides on iron is about one-sixth of the weight; so that If aU the wheels were locked (the extreme limit of retarding force attainable) it would take 12 seconds to bring the train to rest. In this interval and with the above speed it would travel 2i; yards, or more than a quarter of a muile. At half the speed, the rate of a slow train, or 22 miles an hour, it will require only 64 yards, at 33 miles ani hour 144 yards, but at the rnovwmum speed of 66 miles 576 yards (a distance greater than that of most danger signals) to bnng the train to rest when the utmost friction possible is employed. What, now, is the working, and what are the defects of the actual plan ? Tho engineer sees danger abead and aives tbe steam whistle to alarm the guard. He then lets off the steam and reverses the ongine. This occupies, perhaps, two or three seconds. The guard listens to the signal, looks out to see the danger with his own eyes, and than applies the break with all his power. This will probably take four or five seconds more. In the interval the baokiDng of the engine, with no break bebind, wedges up all the carriages into a state of extreme and dangerous compression. Supposing only five seconds to have passed before the break has its full power, this answers to 100 yards substracted from the brief space on which the safety of hundreds of lives depends. But the frictiozi acts only on the engine reversed and the guard's break van. Supposing these together are only one-third the weight of the whole train, the necessary distance is tripled and becomes 768 yards. Suppose them only one-fourth of the whole weight, it becomes more than 1,000 yards. A hundred or more have been lost before full retardation begins. But from ourves, from the unexpected nature of most obstractions which lead to collision, and from the engineer's attention to the fire it is likely that in three cases out of four the daDger i firsb seen at the distance of half a niile. The train, also, may be maoving on a decline, or the rails bO slippery with rain, and in all these cases a collislon seems almost inevitable. What remedy, then, can be proposed which shall confine the risk within hmits prescribed by the very nature of the Inechanical conditions? To profess or to attempt more would be as foolish as to profess to square the circle. A simple answer, I think, may be given. We need some plan -which shell dispense with the loss of time by slinal from the engine to the guard, and which shall lock all the cer riag-s, promptly and certainly, by the mere fact of the sudden backing of the engine itself. lBut can this desideratum be secured without some very CoInplex and impracticable process? It appears to me that it muay easily be done by the following method, and that any clever engineer could soon perfect tbe details, -wvhich are out o~ muy line. The sudden reversal of the englne causes, of course, a great, and, indeed, a dangerous pressure between the buffers of aU the carriages. It is equal, I believe, to about one-sixth of the whole weight of the engine, and is transmitted rapidly through the buffers from the foremost to the hindmost carriage. I have not data by me to fix their relative amount, but I imagine that the sixth of the engine's weight is equal to the whole weight of many of the passenger carriages. All that is wanted is to turn this, when it exceeds a small part of its extreme amount, into a friction pressure, either on thu wheels or the rail. The easier way, I beleve, after some little thought, would be to apply it to the wheels, perhaps the hind wheels, by the following method, or some other of the same kind. Let the front buffers of each carriage consist partly, as at present, of a firm cylindrical stem, -ssay, six inches i diameter; around this, however, let there be fitted a fir. hollow cylinder, with its front padded if desirable, and about three inches in breadth, and attached to four or six springs, fixed either to the stem or to the front of the carriage, so that it may project an inch or an inch and a-half before the solid stem when the springs are not compressed. Let the force of aU the springs, when the moveable part or cap is forced home, be only one-third or fourth of the full push of the engine on the rails. Let the under and back part of this moveable hollow piece have an iron eye, to receive a long slender iron rod. Let a circular breas: or car, fitted to the circuit of the wheel, hang before each of the hind wheels about an inch or two inches in front, and be held there by the iron rod hooking Into it at the other end. These rods, or the moveable heads, or perbxps both, should have a nut, by which their length may be adjusted with needful exactness; and for the sake of steadiness perhaps a croqs rod should connect the two breaks on opposite sides of the carriage. How would this plan work to prevent the evils of sudden colsion ? When the engine is slacked or moved backward sdowly the carriages will be pushed by the springs alone, and the sudden shocks' which are now often so unpleasant wll be replaced by an easier motion. But when, as in the case of danger ahead, the engine is suddenly reversed wlth its whole power, the moveable head will be drlven home till the pressure reaches the solid stem in the centre, At the same time, or perhaps a quarter of an inch before, the head being thus forced back, te rod will force the drag against the wheel, and a pressure wiU be produced equal to oneeighth or ninth of the weight of the engine. If this exceed the weight of the hinder half of the carriage, the wheels will sllde on the rail instead of the drag; in the opposite case they will stil revolve, but the retarding force will be ouesixth of the actual pressure. When the first carriage has locked Itself by its own momentum, as it presses on the engine, the two will slide together as one body, and the next, impinging upon both, wiU be locked stiUl sooner ; and probably in a single second after the engine has been reversed the whole train from first to last will be sliding on the rails. If so, we should have reached the limit of remedial measures. Collision, even ai, express speed, would be averted at the clear distauce of 300, or at least of 40 yards, and of 600 yards with the highest limit d speed on the Great Western trains. One pract;al objection may possibly be made, that the necessary backing of trains would be made difficult. To this there is a double answer, which converts iFt into a furtber reason for the contrivance being used. When the back presqnre is moderate, the wheels will not be locked at all, so that the effect munst be to secure passengers from the fits of caprice by whiel\, trains seem often turned into clock pendulums, to tho disr.ay and perplexity of lady travellers. And, next, wbatever enables the engineer to stop promptly In a short distance wiU usually remove the necessity for backing the train a-t all; at least, at all the road stations, where thetyso oftieaeloss time, and cause trouble by over- I need hardly observe, if the plan be sound in principle, and easy in ap',,lietonw that the periodical saving of life, would hardly be a greater benefit than the lessening of th,,t constant anxiety and freouent alarm to whichmillions of passeng~ are now y exposed. - I remain, your obllged servant, ,,:. r.

RAIL WA Y AND MINING MARBE _ __------A Thursd&y Evening. The railway-market has besn steady, and closes generally without alteration. Great Western, however, receded, from the supply of stock on the market being larger than for some time past; Caledonian were also lower, from sales on Scotch account. Colonial shares continue firm, and some of the smaller descriptions of East Indian have advanced. French closed rather higher, and at 4 o'clock the quotation of Southern of France showed an improvement of 10s. upon the price at that hour yesterday. American securities left off with more firumness ; Illinois Central shares were dealt in as low as 11 discount, but afterwards recovered; New York Central were also better. The transactions in mines have been unimportant; North Wheal Basset were quoted 11. lower. There was a fair demand for joint-stock banks, but no variation occurred. Victoria Dock closed nominally at an advauce of 11. In miscellanoeus securities a further improvement took place in Australian Agricultural, although the official accounts received by the company do not show positively the amount that may be available for a dividend; and Crystal Palace were firm from moderate purchases.

RAILWAY OASE.-A jury case was opened at Perth on Tuesday before Sheriff Mure, which promises to occupy a considerable time, and to afford scope for the exercise of the talent of several learned Edinburgh counsel. The case ls betweee the Drukeld Railway Company on the one hand, and Sir Williata Stewart of Murthly, on the other ; and the point involved is the amount of compensation to be paid by the railway company for the ground they have entered upon belonging to the Murthly estate. There appeared as counsel for Sir William Stewart the Dean of Faculty and Messrs. Gordon and Shand, advocates ; and for the respondents-the railway company-the Lord Advocate and Messrs. Paton and Young, advocates. After a iRry of 13 had been impanetled it was agreed that, &rst of all, they should visit and inspect the ground in question-A process which would probably consume ths greater part of the first day, so that ulterior prooeedings will not be commenced until Wednesday morning. The sum offered by the railway as compensation is between 11,0001. and 12,0001., while Sir W. Stewart estimates his damages at upwards of 40,0001.-ScoO=n7o. TIlE FOROZaY CASE AT HULL.-On Wednesday the investigation of one of the charges of forgery against Mr* E. S. Br%bt, the bankrupt, was resumed at the HuU Poliee-coumt o'fore thethMayor and several of the other magistrates, At 10 o'clock, when the court was opened, a very largo crowd of persons had assembled in the Town-hall yard, r.ear the court, and the numbers af terwards considerably .ncreased, and intense interest appeared to be taken in the proceedings It was decided that the case should be txen as near U1 'clock as possible, and about that time the i 'ordinary police business had been disposed of, and the pri- eoner was brought into the court and ascen,lod the dock. Up ~ o that timue only few had been admitted int, tbe court, but very many were then admitted, and the COUlt continued to be fitled during the whole of the investigation, and a lta crowd remained outside. Four cases of forgery were pr . ferred against Mr. Bright, who at the close of the examika. tino was eommitted for tUihl, bail being refused,-fceis NOZCurC .
BRAILWA Y INTBLLIGENCE. BAST I1-MAN- The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern; Mr. P. 'W. Czxwford, M. ,, in the chair. Mtr. Noad, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Times. The CHIR"sat , in moving the adoption of the report, expressed the deep regret the directors felt at what had occurred in consequence of the mutiny that had broken out in India, It was satisfactory to the shareholders that the injury to the works wAz not go serious as had been apprehended. and whioh had had an effect upon the price of their shares. The injury to the works was not at all of that serious character that had been apprehended, but before going intotnatmatter be would advert to the loss of services they had sustained in consequence of the fate that had befaUen some of their officerm They had received a full account of the state of things in the lower division of their undertaking from their resident engineer ; but, owing to the circumstances that ha i occurred, they had not a full account from their engineer in the North-West Provinces. They had got a list of their loss at Delhi, which included Mr. Taylor, engineer, and Mfr. Benn, inspector. There were five of their officers lost at Cawnpore-Mr. Miller, Mr. Heberden, Mr. La Touch, Mr. Hanna, and Mr. Bayne, He only referred to their principal officers. In Mr. Heberden they had lost one of their most energetic officers. At Allahabad they had lost MIr. Hobson, their locomotive superintendent, who had up to that time most satisfactorily fufihled his duties. Besides, these they had lost some of the ainor officers of the railway below the rank of engineers, and he believed there were some others. He would ask the shareholders to express their app.oval of the consduct of the railway staff and sympathy for those who had been lost in their service. They had referred to the gallant ecoudut of Mr. Boyle and Mr. Kelly in the report for their able defence at a station at Arrah. He (the chairman) would wish them, through Mr. Boyle, to authorize the directors to present the bhst thanks of the company to the officers for their servioes on the occadon mentioned. The directors of the East India Company had In a letter to the board acknowledged the valuable services rendered by Mr. Boyle in defending the station or house, with the aid of a few Sikhs, against a large force of mutineers dnrng seven days. By means of engIeering skill and untirinz erertions Mr. Boyle defended the place, which was no better than a private house, until assistance arrived. It was a source of regret to the directors that it was not in their power to offer any reward to the offlcers for those great services; allthey cwalddowas to express their gratefulthanks to them. As a oorporation they had no feelings of compassion, and if they had they would not be supported in that view. Bdore passing from that subject, there were two gentlemen in their engineering department who had rendered considerable service. Ir. Beater had received information that a body of Insurgents threatened a portion of their works; upon which he took 14 Sikhs with him, and advanced on 120 of thema, whom he dispersed, and brought back 6 prisoners. Just at the time the works of the Poon bridge on their line were in a critical state, the contractors and their men fled from their works; and, as it was necessary to raise the piers above the level of the water to protect them from the floods, Mr. Whitcombe, another engineer, collected as many men as he could, and comploted the necessarg works before the rains set in or the floods commenced, This conduct was deserving of the best thanks of the shareholders. The damage to the works in conse.quenoe of the outbreak bad been much less than was originaUy expected. The fact was, the works had not arrved at that state which would enable evil dis-posed persons to injure them. The only works that had suffered destruction were the stations at Allababad and (Cawnpore, and their workshops, machinery, and tools at Allahabad. The permanent way was laid down from Allahabad for a distance of 44 miles towards Cawnpore before the outbreak, and he was happy to say that by the latest advice he had received from Calcutta one of the company's engineers had traversed the whole distanca of 44 miles on an engine, showing that the line had sustained no injury. The actual damage done was confined to the places he had mentioned. At the works in proparation for the Soane-bridge the damage done was not important ; it was of a miscellaneous character, and the chief injury would be loss of time. Mr. Turnbull, their engineer for the lower portion of their line, bad given them a detauled account of the state of the works. They had applied to their engineer in the upper part of their line for a fuil and detailed account of the damage done and its money value. In the lower part of their extensive lino. from its point of junction with the experimental line, 75 miles in length were still in the hands of the officers of the company. The contractors on a further portion of the works were not proceeding to tho satisfaction of the board. The injury done to the property of the contractors by the Santhal insurrectton had crippled their means, and, as no compensation was given them either by the Company or Government, they were not in a position to proceed lwith the works. There were three contracts in that district, two were in the hands of the company, and the other would soon be in the hands of their engineers. Every exertion would be made during the cold season to complete the works and open that portion of the line as soon as posslble. The exeellent condition of the experimental line, as it was caled, from Calcutta to the Ranegange collieries reflected great credit on Mr. White, the engineer of that portion of their undertaking. From the accounts they would perceive that there was a gradual increase in the passenger and goods traffic. The percentage cost of working was about 36i per cent. of the reeeipts, and would bear favourable comparison with the cost of working railways in the united kingdom. He belleved theirs was the cheapest worked line in existence. It was entirely due to the care Iand ability of their oficers that this satisfactory result had been obtained. (Hear, hear.) The last paragraph in the report expressed the confidence of the directors in the valu e of the undertaking, and it was necessary he should explala some of the grounds upon which that opinion was founded. With regard to the guarantee of the East India Company, that would be equally secure whether the control of affairs were in the hands of the Hon. East India Company or in those of the Imperial Government. It was, in fact, considered a part of the guarantee of the country. (Hear, bear.) T ere was another consideration-the commercIal value of their line. Mr. Turnbull, their engineer, who had been for years in India, and whose opinion was entitled to consideration, had stated his belief that the whole line from Calcutts to Delhi would be constructed at the rate of 10,0001. permile, including a sufficient hupply of rolling stock. Takfng the cost of the line now open at that rate, and allowing 2,0001 per mile as the cost of working stock, the profit woUld yield more than sufficient to pay 5 per cent, on its cost of construction. Their profits had arisen cbiefly from conveying the lowest class of the natives of India and merchandise at low rates. The charge for conveyance of first-class passengers on their line was 2d. per mile, for second-class Id. per mile, and third-class d. per mile. The coals from Ranegungo were conveved to Calcutta for lOs. per ton, and goods at the rate of from id. to ld. per ton per mile. If they were only to consider the enormous traffic they would have when the line was opened to Rajmahal, and afterwards to Allahasad, they would entertin no doubt of an ample return beyond the 5 per cent. guarantee. He then adverted to the services rendered to the company by Sir M. Stephenson. There were two persons to wthose exertions they were indebted for railways in India-Sir M. Stephenson, in the Bengal district, and Mr. J. Chapman, for the Bombay district. He (tbe Chairman) then explained that owing to the liberal course adopted by Sir M. Stephenson towards the company he had not yet derived any advantage fron the agreement he had made with the company for an annuity of 2,500. a-year for past services. The traffic on the experimental line was sufficient to support his claim to that annuity had he raised an objection to the extension line, which certainly had deferred his claim to a later period. Ho had in this as in every other matter made his interests subservient to those of the company. After serving the company in every way he was now in the same podtion as at first, withoutt remuneration. The directors had no power to vote the funds of the company for that purpose without permission of the East India Comparny, and wbat tho Board had pro posed with respect to this matter the East India Company had denied. The shareholders would express their opinion on the matter, and he hoped they would a5uth.ocrize an application to the Egast India Company on the gir.CArxY creconded the mtotion^A for the adoption of the report. rJno reply to a* =ueOn it lwas stated thAbat pzesent the balance in the hands of the East India. Company was 700,0001. Mr. ER,%NxLYN found that the erninga of the line would amount to about 82,000M for the present-year, aad allowing 40 per cent. instead of 36j per cent. fo, workin-A expnses, the net revenue would yield 6S. ls. 7d. ?er cent;, on th cost of that portion of the line. The CIIAmsmA.N had no doubt that Mr, Fr4ssklvn in the main was correct. The line now open was 121 miles in length. It was not oasy to decide what the actual cost of the line was, including rolling stook and it3 proportion of the coat of the large statiott at Howrah, opposdto Chlcntta ; but from the most careful exAmlnnrion he could cnake, including the whole expense of doubling theline. be believed itvwouldbhel1,250,0001. fo the 12 miloe. E3very means would be adopted to expedite the works. 5?hey ware seading out the sections of the ;30ne-bridge against the expre,ssed waishes of some of the authoritlcs,.but they had nAo ether course left them than to forward the works. 7n reply to questons It w3s statsd that. the oriPinal estimate for the coat of the min. to D&hi wFas 1<5,000,000., j but 11,000,0001. would be ample. Resolutions were passed adepting the report, expressing the high sense with -which the company regard the valuable services of the staff, and reetp for those who had been cut off suddenly in their prosperors career, expressing an opinion that the rewulte of the working of the portion of the line now open xal-e it clear that their will be a considerable surrnus over and above the guarantee of five per cent.., ad that under the circumstances the company were justified in making payment to Sir M. Stephens'jn of part of the annuity of 2,5001. per annum seonr,d to him by the deed of 13th of September, 1853, and autho-rizing and requesting the directors to mak-e arrangements v ith the East India Comnpany for the payment of ore.tkmird of that sum annually, commencing from the date of b'.s return to Elngland. The CHAY RmAN explained that tbey had no fund to pay that sum o at of unless the money vsere advanced to themn by the Ea, ,t India Company, to be repaid ont of the funnis i when tb e proper time arrived for paying the annuity ia Ifull. A v-te of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the rroceedings. FORTH AND CLYDE NAVIGATION. The half-yearly meeting of this comVany was held on Tfednesday, at Glasgow; hIr. N. RIobson n the chair, The report stated that there was a considerable in crease in the revenue of the canal for the past half-year, as compared with the half.year ending the 30th of Sey,tembor 1856. The amiount available for dividend, inclsuding 16,25. from last half-year, amounted to 53.357(.. Oct of this sum the governor and councU recommended athe proprietors to declare a dividend at the rate of 6 rer oet. per num, subiect to de4d.uctlon of income-ts a, alierbing 34,2401. and leaviDg as rest 19,1171. An arrngement had been recently concluded with the Caledonian and FAdnburgh and Glasgow Railway Companies, from which the board Anticipate that mutual advantage will be derived. The Ch&IRMAx, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that they were getting o0 pretty wel with the affirs of the canal, and were enabled to give a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. The report was adopted and the retiring directors and auditors re-elected unanimously. The meeting then separated, PEEBLES. The half-yearly meetin& of this company was held at Peebles on Taesday, Sir ( . G. montgomery, LP., in the cbair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Times, w&s taken as read The CiAilzx&N, in moving the adoption of the report, said that there had been a decrease in the persons ctrried, but from the grester distnce travelled the pasnger receipts had Increased by 401. -here was a steady increaSe in every branch of the goods traffic. The increase in the working expenses rendered the directors unable to declare the same dividend as la5t year; but, with an anticipaLted increase of traffic, economy in management, and the lowering of the rate of inlerest, throrwh the issue of preference stock, tthey looked forwasrd vf;th confidence to fature A dividend was declared of 2.* per cent., and the directors were anthold to raise, by borrowing, a sum not NVERNESS AND NAIRN. The report of the directors of the company stated that the receipts during the half year ending 30th of September amounted to 4,7311., and the expenses to 2,9361., leaving a balance of L7951. To this was added 26Sf., the balance from the last hlf-year, mnaking 2 0631. The iote. rest on loans amounted to 1,3941., leaving 6691., out of which the directors proposed a dividenT at the rate of 2 e per cet, per annum, leaving a balance of 351. The increase in the traffic over the corresponding period of last year amonnted to 17 per cen,. The additioas to capital account during the half-year amounted to 2,003'. The company's new Money Blll received the Royal aasnt on the 26th of June last, and authorizes 25,0001 to ba raised on 6 per cent, preferenoe stook. This stock has been well taken p by the shareholders, and when the remainder Is disposed ofthe directors will be in a position to discharge aLl the liabilities of the company. Tie interest acount will thus be reduced, and any diminution in this respect wiLl ,o to increase the dividend to the origal shanrholder-. 93he capital account to the 30th of September showed that 93,341. had been received and 120,0411. expended, leavinz a balance of 26,9071. against the company. The receipts per train mile amounted to 3s. 8id., and the expenses oj 2s. 31d. per train mile. TRAFFIC RETURNS. Miles rae- Mer- 5Toal, Total Ralway. open. aenger. chandise, 1857.

LONDOZ, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1857. A new complexion wil be imparted to the contest in India by the events announced in the last despatches. The concentration of the main body of our forces upon a single point and a definite object will be exchanged for combats of a more desultory kind, while the scenes of actiotppear likely to become both numerous and shifting. We need not expect great battles or look for very important issues. The ascendancy of the British race has already been proclaimed as clearly and as decisively as in the days of CLIVE, and the work now before us will be limited, in all probability, to the general pacification of a country teeming with armed troops, disorganized by the suspension of government, and convulsed by examples of rebellion. Of the capture of Delhi we may now, with all the particulars before us, unhesitatingly affirm, that if the victory was not achieved before it was needed it was certainly not delayed longer than prudence required. Every incident of the final operations shows that it would have been impolitic to attempt the assault at an earlier period, or with a smaller force. It is true that our columns, as had been predicted, were everywhere and uniformly successful, and that not even behind the bastions or in the streets of a fortified city could the Sepoys for an instant maintain their groumd against the soldiers of Britain. But it is also evident that our preparations were none too extensive or our preliminaries too tedious. Although the siege train consisted of nearly 40 pieces of heavy artillery six days elapsed, even after the guns had been got into position and opened upon the defences, before the breaches were judged practicable, and the number of Engineer and Artillery officers killed er wounded in the operations -eight of the former anl five of the latter- proves how completely the affair assumed the 1 aspect of a regular siege. Within the city the resistance was no less stubborn than had been anticipated. The garrison, comprehending probably the most fanatical of the mutineers, struggled with the fury of despair, and so extensive was the area of the works or buildings to be occupied that nearly a week was consumed in advancing successively from one point to another. The magazine alone was found to contain 125 pieces of cannon. The exploit, however, has at length been accomplished, and Delhi is once more in the hands of the British. It is reniarkable that we meet with no estimate either of the numbers of the garrison at the timne of the assault, or of the proportion which may be assumed to have perished or escaped. That General WILSON'S manly and becoming exhortation was not lost upon his indignant troops we may readily believe; but the position of the insurgents was open to the rear, and it is not probable that our efforts to intercept them in their passage of the river could prove very succemsful. A more important subject of speculation, however, is to be found in the course which the fugitives would take. It is, perhaps, safe to assume that they would still be some thousands strong, and they could carry their fanaticism and their arms to any of the many marauding bands now at loose in the North-West. But their accession, except in the mere point of numbers, would be a doubtful advantage, for they are probably almost destitute of munitions and provisions; nor is it easy to see how their resources are to be improved. India abounds in forts and positions of considerable strength, but the utility of Delhi to the rebels was less in its bastions than in its arsenal, and these great magazines are now lost to the.m. They may maintain themselves for some time by pillage, but powder and bullets are not to be stolen in large quantities, nor is the military organization which they seem to have retained in Delhi likely to be long preserved in the precipitation of a flight. It seenms not improbable that our first operations under the new system of campaigning now opened may take place in Rajpootana. This spacious, bat in many parts desolate province, is the land of the Rajpoots-the most martial, athletic, and courageous tribe of Hindostan. It is divided among several Princes, of whom one, the RANA, as he is styled, of Odeypore, is thought to come of the very best blood of India. Jeypore and Joudpore are principalities in the same district, and both are alluded to in the despatches just arrived. A desert territory and a military population may be supposed to convey some advantages to the cause of insurrection, but we are not disposed to anticipate much trouble in these quarters. Hitherto, the spirit of revolt, here as elsewlhere, has been confined either to the Sepoys of the regular army stationed in the province, or to battalions organized upon our own model under the name of Contingents. The Princes themselves have not only been generally loyal, but have been able to control and employ for our advantage the irregular levies under their immediate command. The Rajahs of Joudpore and Jeypore are still with us, though their Contingents have gone, and, though the ferment in the province is said to be exteusive, the actual examples of insurrection are not upon any considerable scale. Our operations have alre.tdy been succea3ful at maore than one point, and as the population, though pugnacious, is not dense, and the resources of the district are scanty, it is hardly probable that the revolt will draw to any serious head. We should expect rather a series of desultory combats, in which the insurgents would seldom make any successful stand, except with unusual advantages of position or against native levies less efficiently organized than themselves. Whatever, indeed, may be the general effect of these protracted convulsions upon the native mind we cannot presume that the result will be seen in any greater concert of action than bhs been witnessed hitherto. If the long occupation of the Mlogul capital by a mutinous army did not produce or cisclose any organized projects against our rule, it is not to be supposed that such will be the consequence of any contingency to be now anticipated. Our work will probably lie, not in pitched battles or decisive engagements; but in short sieges, such as those of earlier Indian canipaigns, and in detached conflicts with such bands of mutineers as hazard may throw together. It is not to be denied that disquietude seems to make progress in districts hitherto tranquil, nor is the fact, indeed, any matter for marvel; but, though the Asiatic temper may be incapable of permanently resisting the temptations of anarchy, it must be remembered that the position and resources of our own Government are now assuming a very different character from that which they have worn for the last five months. It cannot be too often repeated, or too steadily borne in mind, that the direct action of England upon the Indian insurgents had not, up to the last despatches, been felt in the slightest degree. On the 14th of September, as on the 14th of May, the Government of India was contending against an army in mutiny with even a smaller number of troops than was nominally assigned for the pacific occupation of the country. All the assistance forthcoming was derived from indirect and fortuitous sources, and yet the result has been so far favourable that already we may assume the revolt to have been substantially crushed. Not only has Delhi been stormed and taken-not only is Oude invaded by a resolute column marching directly upon its capital, but our smaller detachments in various parts are holding their own or asserting a more active superiority. General VAN CORTLAnDT at Jhansi, and Colonel LAWNVNCE at Awa, are both said to be masters of the field; and, if such is even now the case, what is to be expected when 30,000 or 40,000 British troops are poured into the country, and large levies of Sikhs and Ghoorkas have been added to our armies ? We may find revolt breaking out in many quarters, -that is possible enough, but our multiplied columni; will soon give an account of the revolters. We have known in past times what it was to deal with such embarrassments. There is no likelihood that any combination on the present occasion will result in such an organized force of marauders as was presented forty years ago by the Pindarees, and yet, with resources far inferior to those we shall presently possess in India, our commanders succeeded in extirpating the whole predatory brood. Even if a stand should be made beyond expectation in some particular stronghold our means will not be at fault. The succours despatched to the East comprise a force of Engineers and Artilery sufficient to destroy every I city in Hindostan, and our preparations, in fact, have been adapted in every detail to the regular conquest of a country. We do not anticipate that the demands upon our resources will in reality rise to the estimated level. It would be more reasonable, indeed, to calculate that the forces which the capture of Delhi will disengage may prove adequate to any work remaining, but it is satisfactory in the extreme to reflect that, while our enemies have been discomfited and scattered, our own armies have, month after month, acquired fresh consolidation, and will soon receive such an accession of strength as must be absolutely overwhelming.
The order of prophets cannot be said to be wholly extinct so long as Mr. DRU-YSNOND remains to preach to us upon public events. " Prophets," we say, but we must apologize; the hon. gentleman, we believe, belongs to a far higher order than that. We of the old and bygone dispensation naturally think a prophet a great mau, and think it a compliment to a person to call him one, but in that new dispensation to which, according to common report, Mlr. DBRu3uOXD has attachod himself, a prophet is not much of a man he only ranks about fifth, we believe, in the hierarchical scale,-that is to say, his rank is rather less than that of a deacon in the Established Church; in short, he is nobody at all, or, at best, only a junior optime in the Class List. He has been left sadly behindhand in the march of events, so many now spiritual " thrones, " dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers" have risen up since his day. The time was when he used to think something of himself, used to tell everybody his duty, exert spiritual sway, and tower in lofty speech above the lax morals, injustice, and corruption of a degenerate world; but all this is over now, and in the new system he gives place to his betters, and hides his diminished head before a celestial and supermundane hierarchy. Nevertheless, with this apology, we shall take the liberty of calling Mr. Dur.MMOND a prophet, because he has many of the characteristics of one, and the title at least suits him as well as another which he is said to bear. His style displa5s the sudden impulses, quick transitions, apparentirrele. vancies, interjected matter, threats, warnings, and rebukes of prophecy. You never l;now where the next sentence will take you, and it is evident that he speaks under the influence of some kind of inspiration. It is not the ordinary working of reason, which has its regular methods and succession from point to point; it is an afflaolms. He speaks from moment to moment as the sacred impulse moves him: first comes a blast of censure, then a joke, then a sarcastic inuendo, then an a-wful denunciation, then a bit of practical advice, then a theological dogma; a succession of sudden sharp turns produces the most intricate variations of light and shade, and thns he rumbles, thunders, shoots, and laughs out a 3peech. This is, perhaps, as much of inspiration as the congregation of Surrey farmers at Chertsey would care to hear. Mr. DRUAm;O.ND is a man of tbe world as well as a prophet ; he knows that neither an agricultural association, nor even the House of Commons, could bear an unmixed and unveiled prophet; so he suits his style to the audience. This is meat for babes, the nearest dis play to the true prophetic one that this dete riorated nineteenth century can bear. Let us see what Mr. DIU,MuqOND has to offer us on the subject of the Indian Mutiny. We can listen to a prophet when he speaks the truth, as Mr. DRUM1MOND certainly does when he says " we " have tampered with idolatry in India." But it is a pity the preacher cannot stop at this one charge, on which we are A.11 agreed, but must needs go on to something else, and make out a couplet with an antithesis. " We have tampered with " idolatry not only in India, but at home." WVe do not exactly know wlhat Mr. DRUi;MOND means by this, but we suppose he means to say that the Maynooth grant, or something of that sort, is a tampering with idolatry, and therefore as bad as the long toleration of the Suttee system, the ' x,g-raaut sacriZices, the lo eling of 1;ritish armnn to Hindoo idols, and, in short, the whole " tradi"tional policy." " For himself, he thought that "to pray to MrAnoxmv; was no worse than to wor"ship the VxIN M1BY." ThiB is sharp and summary. Nevertheless, we think it doubtful whether Mr. D]u)MmroND himself feels exactly the same about a Roman Catholic as he does about a Mahomedan. Would he be prepared, for example, to call a Mahomedan a Christian-a name which we suppose he would, however reluctantly, allow to a Romarn Catholic'? Mr. DasutmO.fD probably meets Roman Catholics in society constantly, if not at Albury, at least in London, when he goes up to attend to his Parliamentary duties; he sits by them and opposite them at dinner perpetually, he overtakes them going up the same stairs and underneath the same brilliant chandeliers. Does he mean to say that he would even talk, joke, and laugh with Mahomedans, as probably he does for six months in the year with Roman Catholics, much less hold that community of religious faith or sympathy with them which he and the most stanch Protestants cannot help holding with the Roman Catholic, to a certain extent ? Is it not the case that some of the tenets of the communion to which Mr. DnRmni3oN-D belongs are much allied to Roman Catholic ones, so that very nice distinctions are necessary? But, perhaps, this is only an instance of the old observation, that religious schools dislike each other in proportion to their mutual proximity. Mr. DRtUIrNoND may talk for a long time before he persuades either the world or himself that the support of Maynooth is the same thing as the patronage of Indian superstitions. There is much truth, we have no doubt, in wha'; Mr. Diu2IZIOND says about our want of foresight, as a nation. "The fault of English people wvas "that they did not look ahead; and then, when "any great calamity occurred, it was said, 'Oh "' lawks, who could have thought it?'" But, though there is a good deal of truth in this charge, so vividly expressed, and with such a comnmand of the vernacular, Mr. DRnmrroxrD is a better critic than adviser. We do not understand his ground for laying down the law so summarily as he does onthequestion of punishment. He has decided on some ground or other, and he states the conclusion dictatorially, that only the leaders in this Mutiny should be punished. " They should punish those who were "at the head of the Mutiny, but do not let them "have any of that indiscriminate justice which "has been advocated." WVe have never advocated indiscriminate vengeance, but neither do we sea why punishment should be inflicted on the leaders only of this mutiny, and not at all on the followers. The advice is very impracticable, because how are we to find cat so accurately who have been the leaders, aud who the followers ? The general remark which is made on this Indian Mutiny ;S that it has no leader-no apparent heads. No names come up to the surface except those of one or two Nawabs and Raj ahs whohave distinguished themselves bybutcheryrather than byhead work. There is an epidemic, one regiment goes off after another, the contagion spreads, and a great rebellion is the iesuilt; but -vho have contrived it all, if indeed it has been the work of a regular contrivance at all, nobody can say. People say the Mahomedans are at the bottom of it; on the surface, however, it is a Hindoo affair altogether at first, and only joined by the Mahomedans afterwards. WN'ho are the leaders, then, and how are we to catch them? How are we to apply Mr. DRuInrlON&'S rl'le, his absolute and broad distinction between leaders and followers, in the case of a movement where all are followers and none are leaders ? Of course, united action of any kind involves some in command and others under command, but how are we to tell whether the movement did not make the commanders, rather than the commanders the movement? It is very easy for gentlemen who speak at cheerful county festivals, and whose critics are their own tenants, to lay down summary rules of action for our Brigadiers in India, but we cannot help thinking that Mr. DI)RiYO?vD does not know much about his subject when he solves the whole practical difficulty of punishnienu by such a rule as this.
In the libel case which occupied the attention of the Central Criminal Court on Tuesday and Wednesday last some facts were elicited regarding the transmission of telegrams which are of the utmost importance to the public. The issue immediately at stakle is, indeed, of little consequence. It does not much concern us to know that, in the opinion of the jury, Messrs. EVANS and TnORNE have been guilty of libel and attempted extortion, or that none of the charges of corruption brought against Mr. CADOGAIT, the prosecutor in this case, have been proved. We look solely to the evidence of the prosecutor, and in his own admissions find cause for dissatisfaction with the arrangements of the Suibmarine Telegraph Company, and a justification of the warning which three months ago appeared in the columns of this journal. It may be remembered that when remarking on some unaccountable delays which had occurred in the transmission of telegraphic news from India at the end of July last-a period of intense anxiety and considerable fluctuation in the funds-we alluded to a suspicion which such irregularities might not unreasonably excite as to the purity of Directors or their servants, and pointed to the obvious remedy which a healthy competition would afford. Sir JAMFs CARMTICIIAEL, Chairman of the Submarine Telegraph Company, at once wrote to offer explanations, but at the same time also to express his suirprise that the Directors and servants of the company should not be regarded as utterly beyond suspicion. In publishing his letter we accepted the explanation, declaring, however, that we saw no good reason why English companies, from the Directors down to the messengers, should of necessitybe supposedimmaculate, and that never a word of suspicion should, under any circumstances, be uttered against them. The extraordinary confidence of Sir JAamin CARMtICHAEL immediately drew forth a letter from a Mr. EvANs, who had previously occupied a very responsible position in the service of the Submarine Company, and who brought the most serious charges against the Deputy-Chairman. The letter was not perinitted to appear in our columns, but was brought to the notice of Mr. CADOGCA X by the friend and fellow-prisoner of the writer, and it was the truth of Mir. EvANs's allegations, and the purity of his motives in making them, that have been this week in question at the Central Criminal Court. His statements were by no means made good, and we see no reason to dispute the justice of the verdict found by the jury, still enough was said to prove beyond a doubt that the public have no adequate protection within thc Submarine Telegraph-office, that the arrangements for the transmission of despatches are characterized by extreme laxity, and that it is not for want of ample opportunity that ,,he confidence of correspondents is not betrayed every day of the week and every hour of the day. MIr. CADOGAN, the Deputy-Chairman of the Submarine Telegraph Company, is a barrister by I rofession, but since 1848 has been in the habit of speculating in funds and shares. Necessarily his position gave him the means of obtaining the best and earliest information at tlle public expense ; and he does not appear to have perceived that more than ordinary caution was req uirel on the part of a Directnr eonnected, ash , win the par Sof a i r.crn e 1w wi~th,th Stxck-Exchl-~ tq~_'o prtsorve himself, we do not say from evil, but from the appearance of evil. As Deputy-Chairman, Mr. CADOGAIN was continually at the office of the company in Cornhill, but evidently his place there was in the room appropriated to the Board, and not in the room where the instruments were at work. Yet he frequently went to this latter room; he frequently, also, examined the various flea of messages. He says that he had occasion to do so in order to determine questions raised among the Directors as to the manipulation and cost of messages. We do not question his motives, but there can be no doubt that an anxious correspondent, could he have known the fate of his message, would have felt most jealous of such inspection, and especialy could he have traced M.r. CAnoGA-'S footsteps after leaving the instrument-room. " Have you not been in the habit of going from the company's office to your stockbroker's four or five "times a-day ?" asked the defendant's counseL "I have not been in the habit of doing so," was Mr. CADoo-'s reply; " I may have gone to my "stockbroker's two or three times a-day, but not "four or five times." " Have you ever, after "looking at a ifie of messages, gone direct to your "stockbroker's ?" continued the defendant's counsel. " I cannot say whether I have cone so," was the reply; " if I have there has been no con" nexion between the acts." Connexion or no connexion, however, it is quite clear that the procedure was ambiguous, and that the public cannot tolerate such opportunities of wrongdoing. Not only was the Deputy-Chairman in the habit of inspecting the messages received from abroad, he did not refrain from looking at those about to be despatched; and in one instance, at least, he gave to the message of a friend a precedence to which it had no right, taking it from near the bottom of the file and placing it on the top. He says that he had no improper motive in doing so, that the message was not of a kind to come into competition with the others which were less favoured, and that if it had not been despatched in this way it would have been utterly useless. This may be all very true, but it is of no avail to make the public satisfied as to the safety of their correspondence. The same is to be said of several other irregularities to which Mr. CADOGAN has confessed. He may be the very best of men; he may be a perfect stoic as regards the money-market; but unfortunately the public do not believe in stoics, least of all in stoics who cultivate intimate relations with the Stock-Exchange, and it is not to be endured that the Directors of a Telegraphic Company, whatever their ordinary occupation, should be permitted to indulge their curiosity with regard to the messages intrusted to their care. For YMr. CADOGAN is not alone, and in these remarks we are very far from condemning him. We condemn the system, common, so far as we know, to all the Telegraphic Companies, in which such practices are permitted. It is evident, then, that the public have no security with the present mode of transmitting messages. The telegraphic system is, in fact, a postal system without sealingwax. As we cannot seal our telegrams, the next best thing is to seal hermetically the instrument-rooms through which they are conveyed, by forbidding all egress as wel as ingress during certain hours. The messages intended for transmission should be sent into the instrumentroom by mechanical means, and those received for delivery should, after being placed in their envelopes, be in liko manner given out to the messengers by mechanical means. We do not say that even such checks as these would absolutely protect correspondents. Our most perfect locks can be picked; the Roretta inscription has been read, the most complicated cipher can be detected, and ingenious rogues may be able to evade the most happily contrived system of checks. But, as the one thing essential to the security of the public against the divulging of their nevws is that aU intercourse with the instrument-room during working hours should be absolutely impossible, we believe that such a precaution would render any treachery incalculably difficult and correspondence by the telegraph nearly as safe as transmission by the post. And for the benefit of the Telegraphic Companies let us point out what they seem to have forgotten,-that this perfect secrecy is necessary, not only for the sake of MTinisters who work in the dark and write to each other in cipher, of merchants who have fortunes at stake and determine the price of Consols in some sly phrase that seems rather like a jest than an affair of millions, of every man who wishes to keep his business to himself-it is demanded by the feeling of the country. A system of espionage is intolerable to us under any form. It is not pleasant to know that a man is standing over our shoulders and reading what we write, even should it be nothing more important than an invitation to dinner. Were such prying common in our telegraphic offices it would be quite effectual in bringing this mode of correspondence into disrepute, even if no interests were damaged by the intrusion. We are, as a people, free and frank; we are anything but secretive ; still, as every man's house is his castle, which it is burglary to force, so every man's letter is his desk, which it is treachery to invade.

Her Royal Highness the Dachess of Kent visited Her Majesty at the Castle. Lord Stanley of Alderley arrived in town yesterday from Alderley-pak.
A Cabinet Council was held yesterday afternoon at the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury in Downing-street. It was attended by V7iscount Palmerston, the Lord Chancellor, Earl Granville, Earl of Harrowby, Sir George Grey, Earl of Clarendon, Mr. Secretary Labouchere, the Right Hon. R.

Ordinary Seamen.-Thomas Blanch, Bolton; Reuben Opton and Charles Hyland. Boys.-David Balfour (cap. tain's son) and Charles James Emerson. A little boy named Edwards is also supposod to have been on board. The screw steamers that have reached the north-east ports this week report passing through a good deal of floating wreck to the southward of Flamborough Head. A screw steamer that arriYed in the Tyne on Saturday reports also that the crew observed a vessel like a Norwegian bark go down, and apparently drown all hands that morning. It is a remarkable thing that, with the exception of the Ontario, few, if any, Tyne vessels have suffered during the gale ; and it will be seen frow the names recorded above that, with the exception of th, master and mate, she had not a seamean belonging to tht north-east ports on board at the time that she was wrecked.

AMERICA. (By Ec:BIc AsD nUERNTONAL TLEGRAPIH.) SOUTEHAMPTON, T=JRsDAY EVRIfG. The United Statee' mail steamaship Fulton, Captain Wotton has arrived at Cowee, with advice from New York to the 17th irst. She has $50,000 in specie for London; also 12 paasengers for Southampton, and 72 for France. In reference to monetary affairs the New York Mornig Express of the 17th says:- " The ' crisis' as a newspaper topic is beginning to ran to aeed; by thenext week it would notbesurprisingif readers as well as editors should try and think of something else. The excitements we have had this week are altogether too violent to last long; meanwhile we continue the record under the proper beads of everything fresh by telegraph and maiL It is almost certain that there will be no extra session of the Legislature. Mr. Samuel A. Foote and Mr. Samuel B. Rnggles were beard at Albany on Friday in behalf of the New York city banks objecting to it. The Governor sees no necessity for it at present, but will hold the subject under advisement. " At New Orleans the run on the banks continues, but the ' panic' and the ' excitement' are dying out. "The Bridgport (Connecticut) bauks have suspended. The report of the failare of Doan, King, and Co., of St. Louis. is authori tatively contradicted. At Boston all Is quiet; everybody wants to see what is going to turn up next. At New Orleans, on the 14th, there was a general run upon the banks, and several suspensions were announced; the run continued on the 15th, and continues heavy there being much excitement, and business was paralyzed. Money matters were in a very unsettled state. Cincinnati and the banks at Nashville had suspended." A despatch from St. Louis of the 15th says,- " That there had been a heavy run on the banks of the State of Missouri all the morning, and opinions conflicted as to their ability to hold out." The NTew Yor.k Herald of the 17th, in reviewing the state of the money-market on the previous day, says,- "There was a very buoyant stock-market thls morning. Every ounce of weight haa been talken off the safety valve, and stocks are going up on the run, The Stock-Exchange appears to have had quite an accession of operators from some source, and they take hold with great avidity. At the first board to-day New York Sixes, 187,4, advanced 3 per cent.; Ohio Sixes, 1860, 3; California Sevens, 3; New York Central Railroad Sevens, 3; Erie Bonds, 18175, 3 ; Ditto, 1871, 2; Ditto, 1883, J; Galena and Chicago Railroad, 4; Illinois Central Bonds, 1; Bank of Commerce, lA; American Exchange Bank, 5; Delaware and Hudsons, 6; Pacific Steamship Company, 2; New York Cen tral Railroad, 3; Erie Railroad, 1; Hudson River Railroad, 2; Reading, 11; Michigan Soutbern Preference, 3; Panama, 2; Illinois Central and Rock Island, 3. Here is an advance equal to anything of the kind we have seen for many m onths; at this rate a few days would suffice to bring us b ack, as far as prices for stock securities are concerned, to the palmy days of last spring. The 'bulls' have beyond aU question full possession of the market. Holders of stocks may not, as a general thing, be inclined to seU even at the present quotations; they are all looking for prices far beyond those now current. These stock-speculators are a very sanguine set of persons; the higher the stocks go the higher they think they must gc. Parties who a fev days since were free sellers at the lowest prices are now free buyers at the highest points. The actual position of the banks is not rightly understood by these speculators. It is unfortunately the general impression that under a suspension of specie payments the largest expansion can be practised with impunity- that there is no restraint, no check upon an inflation, and that the banks bave, in fart. the largest liberty In aU their operations. There never was a greater mistake in the world, or one more calculated to entail up on the community consequences of a most fatal character. It is the impression that the banks are at liberty to do just as they please in the w ay of discounting which has given such an upward impetus to the stockmarket. The sooner the public mind is satisfied that the banks have, if possible, even a more difficult and dangerous duty to perform than before the suspension, the better, for if made fuly aware of the consequences we shall see a very important andlwholesome change in the complexion of the stock-market and of financial affairs generally. It must be borne in mind our banks have to keep constantly in view the fact that sooner or later a resutmption of specie payments must take place; that this suspension must terminate; that the currency of tle country must come down to a specie basis; that all this paper inflation must explode; and that prices must be again regulated by the true standard of value. Amy extension of loans by the banks is utterly out of the question, and we are glad +o see that no attempt has been madeto raise the line of discounts. The position of the banks is no enviable one, and they know it. They have at this moment no legal existence. The proeeedings of our court in relation to these institutions exhibit a state of things that must create in the mind of every good citizen the most fearful apprehensions regarding the future; we have but seen the beginning of this affair; we are literally in a state of anarchy, and must look to the consequences. There are other officers of the State besid es those of our courts who have a part to perform in this drama, and It vill not be many days before some of the reaults of this suspendon wvil be re alized in a shape very different from that anti^l pated. The banks of the State of New York have actually absolutely suspended specie payments, and they are now inl the hands of the law ; the controller, the banking superintendent, and the State authorities, acting under special laws, will be obliged to take certain steps in the discharge of their duty that must force every bank in the State into liquidation any order or decision of the Supreme Court cannot stay the proceedings of our State authorities. The process laid down by speoial Acts for forcing banks of issue into liquidation; is so simple and so imperative that our courts cannot prevent its operation. A11 law for the collection of debts, for the enforcement of contracts, must be suspended in individual cases if done so for banking institutions. It is very easy to talk about the necessity, on account of the great emergency, of favouring the banks in their extremity, but It Is not so easy in the practice, and so our banks will fid before the lapse oE 60 days. In view of the'pains and penalties which must be inflicted upon the suspended banks, and in view of the simple operation of the law which every court must recognize, we look upon the present inflation in prices for stock securities, and the idea that fills the public mind regarding the removal of the financial pressure, as one of the most dangerous movements of the day. The banks understand pretty well how they standvwith their creditors, and entertain the most serious apprehensions the controller may be compeUled to act in the most summary manner, and ho may be compelled to force every bank In the Stato into liquidation. The clearing-house i; getting rapidly in order again; several of the banks which suspended before the general break-down have come into line, and a few days may see all but the two which have come borne liquidation again in operation. The balances between the different institutions are adjusted by certificates issued bythe Metropolitan Bank, and the greatest facilities are afforded by the admirable system anl management of the clearing-house. At the second board the market opened and closed without much alteration; a fair amount of business was transacted, principally for cash. New York State Fives, 18.S, advanced 1 per cent.; Haarlem R.ailroad, }; Cleveland and Pittsburg, 1; Cleveland and Toledo, 4; Chicago and BockkIsland, 14; Erie, 4; Pacic Steamship Company, A; Panama Railroad, 1, Milwaukie and Mississippi Rtailroad declined j per cent.; Hudson Railroad, 4; IUinois CentralPRailroad, 1; New York Central, A; Cumberland Coal, i.'' In their trade circular of the 17th inst., made up for the Fulton, Mesare. Pond and Sage, brokers of Wall-street, state,- "Since our circular of the 1st inst. our market has con. tinued much depressed, and the uncertainty regarding creditors has almost caused an entire suspension of sales, with the exception of a few parcels for export and for refining. It is very difficult to fix quotations, inasmuch as there has been no regularity in prices; at the present moment we incline to the belief that our market has seen its lowest point, and that prices must gradually improve. Our stock is becoming reduced by exports to European markets of both sugar and melado, so that at the end of the present month we anticipate giving more favourable advices." A frightful catastrophe happened on the Central Raihoad onL tlle eveninig of the lth, about six muiles west of Syracuse. It seems that the recent rains had weakened an embankment at Nine-mile Creek, so that when the train calme along it gave way, and the cars ,; ere precipitated one uipon the oLher into the stream. To add to the horror of the Scene the mail car caught fire, and all the mail bags save one were destroyed. It was stated that of GO passengers who were in the cars two or three were killed outright, and some dozen others were ahockingly mnutilated. The steamship Northern Light, -with the Californian mails aud I,6l34,2Ok) i specie, arrived it New York on the 16tb. There was no news of importance from Oregon or W Aashington territor-ies, or Carsou Valley. tAdvwces fromu 11z-4uah ate tQ We,q l,.L iust,, but

IRELAND. (wO OUB oWwN ooRNpoMNDM.) DUBLIN, THURSDAY Momm-m. TRE CHP BAON. Chief Baron Pigott, whose health had been rather indifferent for some weeks past, has returned to Dublin from Paris, and has taken his seat as one of the Judges at the Commission Court now sitting. His Lordship appears to have completely recovered from his temporary indinposition. SEWS FOR THE IRISH SEPOYS. Accounts from Limerick state that one regiment in that garrison is obtaining recruits at the rate of 4 per day, and that -already the new second oattalion of the 3d Buffs numbers 640 active young fellowrs fit for any service. CtkhtUrMLOCUTION. One of the Dublin journals, commenting upon the last Indian news, or last so far as is known through the mists of telegraphic despatches, obBerves,- ' It is curious that in the verbose and confused telegram of the Government not a word was given regarding Lucknow or Agra. W'hat intelligence we have we gained from the clear and lucid message of 27Le Times, which, though it did not occupy anything likethe samee amonnt of space, even conveye(d the price of stocks, &c., at Bombay and Calcutta -subjects so interesting to English merchants, and forming so good a test of public opinion there." THE LATE 3.URDEIt Dt TIPPERARY. A letter, dated Thurles, Wednesday evening, giver the following fresh particulars connected with the assassination of Mr. John Ellis .- " The particulars of the horrible murder of the late Mr. Ellis, about three miles from the town, have been pretty correctly given to the public already by the metropolitan press, but the anxiety consequent upon the awful outrage induced me to proceed to the locallty of the murder and find out some furtber particulars and accurate details, which I hasten to coiititiinicate. The assassin appears to have iratured his plans and carried them into exeoution with the utmost callmness, deliberation, and composure. The bush trom which the fatal shot was fired he had so arranged that he could bring down his man with as an unerring accuracy as if he were ain,ing from the loopholed walls of a fortified town; be bad actually placed a stick across the bush for the purpose of resting the deadly weapon with which he fired. There is now littie doubt but that weapon was a blunderbuss, and not a pistol, as before stated, and that the charge was niost powerful. No less than seven wounds wero found on the back of the poor victim where the slugs first entered, and hut one orifice was traceable in front; and the medical genrlemarn. T nim toll. considers that some bone with which they came in contact must have altered their course so much as to drive them all in a certain direction; but I fancy ,any of the slugs still remain in the body. The object of ,lacmng the obstruction of the bushes on. the road was not, would. appear, altogether for the sole object of sto poor )fr. I<liirThe purpose, rumour has it, was twofoidviz., had a random shot been fired the driver might have come in for it, but it was well surmised that he -would have got down to remove the obstraction, and so that obstacle wee removed. The assassin was evidently in no hurry titber, and quite sure his viotlm would pass that way, although it was not his accustomed route, and the Thursday nitht previous he had returned by a more frequented rcad-by Dover. He remained, I was told, some half o our smoking after the arrival of the train before proceeding homeward, so the assasin must have had a fong and deliberate lying in wait. Mr. Ellis was a most determined man, it appears, and, although he had heretofore received a terrible and awful warning, continued very incautious and unguarded, as is evidenced by his travelling so frequently asid so late at night, a practice he was often cautioned against. About eight years since some evictions were about to take place on the property over which be was placed, and I amn told on reliable authority that a ,um of .50W. eaci was offered to the defaulting tenants for the peaceable suirrentder of their holdings. but would not be .ccepwd. This od'er took place on a Saturday, and on the following night .iMr. Ellis was fired at with a pistoL and with such uierring aim that the paper of the charge actually struck bim and bu-nt his coat. The pistol it w.-ould appear had been carried in the pocket of the miscreart, and it is conjochtrud that, in his mounting aud getting over and down hedges and ditches,the ball ProvidentIally fell out, and reinained. unki,own,in his nooket. Agreat many dlifferent opinions exi,t and, with some apparent truthfulnessreports and rumours arc in circulation vwhich would tend to ,how that this foul iumurder could not be classed among those termed agrarian, but was simply the result of revenge; but as this cannot be dectd,d for some tinime, or perchance never, It is better to reserve writing further thereupon-at least for the prepent. Five arrests were made on Mondasy night last i,y the police, and the parties-who were all arrestedat their rsspVective hocies, situate within gunshot of Ellrush, Mr. ti lls's late residence -- lodgedlin Thnrles gaol forexamiination. lhey are two men named Cormack and their sister, a man "amed Brophy, and the boy Burke, who drove the car on ,.be fatal r,ight. Last night two other arrests took place -viz., twoo anen nanmed Cleary and two girls named Brophy od Dougla.s. The object of the arrest of manybf those I 'e3heve simwly to be ior the purpose of examination, and I ould detail manXy further fasts 'which are current in the n.eighbourhood as touching the suspicion attaching to parties as being iipllpited in the foul transaction, but as I believe it will tend more to further the ends of justice not to - prerd them I will refrain. Ten police aud one constable arrived from the depot on Sunday, and are quartered on the '&wnland, which will, under the Crime and Outrage Act, have to bear their whole expense. A large reward should be ofl:ered at once by the Government for theapprehensionof the sessassmi or ibformmtation that will lead thereto, for, whether the outrage be agrnrian or otherwise, it is quite evident the *impaWv .,f *hrr small farmers and labouring class in the neighbourhood is vith the assassin, besides many, who, dlthougl they oaty olt do it openly, yet in spirit you can ,ress their satisfaction at the vile deed, and the following ,act will verify what I say as regards the open and avowed 'ustility to landlords and evictions which yet exists here. The csse to which I allude was tried at the Tipperary .huar:er S9 Esions last Saturday before Serjeant Hlowley. The prisoiner was indicted for an assault, doing actual ncdily harm,, and it canme out on the trial that the reason of -Le ston h- in, flung at the prosecutor in the city of Cashel s,d which cut him severely on the head and knocked him !. on, was because he became a tenant to a farm from which the prisoner's father had been evicted 13 years since.

LYCOUM THEATRB. The ancient glorles of the Bohemnian GirZ were revived at this theatre last night, when a new opera by Mr, BalSe, entitled The Rose of Castile, -was produced with a success as great as was probably ever achieved by the composer of the first-named popular work. The event was doubly in. teresting to admirers of English music, since, in addition to the unfailing charm of novelty, there was the credit already attached to the Pyne and Harrison management, for which the very complete and admirable performance of Auber's Crown Diamond-s had already won the favourable consideration of amateurs. The first original opera presented under this directorate was natarally looked forward to with anxiety, as a more satisfactory test of its capabilities than could possibly be obtained from the revival of any foreign adaptation, or, indeed, of any native production with which the public was previously familiar. The result left no disappointment; on the contrary, the expectations raised by the Crown Diarmonds were more than realized by the Rose of Castilc. Of course, we allude to the exceUence of the perfornance,-not to the merits of the new work, of which a second hearing will better enable us to judge. We must be satisfied at present-as the opera terminated at an unusually late hour-with a brief aeknowledgment of the highly efficient manner in which it has been p'aced upon the stage, and of the genuine and cordial reception It experienced throughout. The house was crowded to the coeiling, and the applause Festowed upon Mr. Alfred MeUon, musical director at the Lyceum, when he took his place in the orchestra, showed at once that the audience had assembled with a fuU deteormination to be pleased. Rarely, indeed, I.as satisfaction more unequivocal and more unanimous been expressed. From the overture to the end, every piece was honoured with unmistakeable manifestations of approval; end no less than six " encores," two or three of them uproaricos, were among the significant incidents of the evening. At the end of each act Miss Louisa Pyne and Mr. Ilarrison were called before the foot-lights; and then, in obedience to a summons from the whole hou e, Mr. Balfe, the composer, appeared to receive the hearty felicitations of his admirers. When the cur. tain had fallen on the third act the applause became quite deafening; Messrs. Weiss and Honey came forward, in additlon to those we have mentioned; and last, not least, Mr. MeUon, to whose talent and exertions so much of the success was due, and who was received in a manner almost as hearty and spontaneous as Mr. Balfe himself. This compliment was well merited, since we believe a more generaUy correct and effective frst appearance (of a new and difficult composition has seldom, if ever, been witnessed. Mr. Balfe has gone to the old storehouse for his book* The Rose of Castille is a free transl&tion as to dialogue and verse, but a close one as to plot and incident, of the Muleeies de 1'olede, by MM. Dennery and Clairvfle. This-the second opera set to music by the late ML Adolphe Adam for Madame Marie Cabel-was brought out at the ThUttre Lyrique, in December, 1S54, when that accomplished songstress was turning the heads of all Paris. A sort of adaptation, half drama half ballet, was produced in a condensed foam, the year follow*ng, at the Princess's Theatre, for Miss Carlotta Leclereq, the greater part of M. Adam's music being omitted. So 'hat the story, with all its entertaining improbabilities, is stot altogether unknown to the public-a fact, by the way, which, in the opinion of many, is decidedly advantageous to an opera; and, if we may accept the Bar6iere de Siriqlia, the Gazza Ladra, the Sonnambcua, and other lyrical masterpiece6, as precedents, not without eason. MIr. Balfe, in composing music for the peculiar talent of Miss Louisa Pyne, has gone far beyond his French predecessor. Whether the Irish inusician wrote from a conviction that hliss Pyne could execute even greater difficulties than Madamze (abel-whose gift was to astonish by her facile execution almost as much as to nchrant by the graces of style-we are unable to guess, At any rate, he has not written in vain; for vocalization more finished and extraordinary than that with which Miss Pyne repeatedly roused the audience to enthusiasm last night was never listened to, The ouly doubt that might have arisen was whether she had not been overtaxed -as to quantity, not as to difficulty, since Miss Pyt,e does not seeun to be aware that difflculties exist. But, asin the final air her voice was as fresh and unimipaired, aud her execuxion as easy and fluent as at the beginuing of th, opera, if the question was raised at aly period of the perforinance, it must have been effectually dispelled at the conclusion. Having thuis shortly chronicled the siecess of the Rose of Castille, we must defer what remarks we have to make upon the music and performance in detail until another oc- cabiou.

f -a-I; INDIAN RgJrEF FUND. DEPTFORD lJat evaning a public meetiug of the inhabitants of Deptfod and thea hamlet of Hstcham was be.o5 at Deptford in aid of the national ftnd for the relief of th, sufferers by the Indian mu' ny. The chair was occupied by :-ieutensutGeneral Sir William Codrington, one of the mwewabers for Grentwich, and on the platf,rm were se7eyal ufiriaeC tial residents of the locality. The gallant CHrAtRIv said, the subject which they were asembled to consider camebome tothoheartof every Engh)lsi - nan, and should involve no controverSy of a pohtical nacmUo. The 5iteUllgence just received from India was cheering, ani I when it was considered that the mere handful of suldiers which was in India at the commencement of the outbreak had, almost unassisted, held the country and obtained most important victories over the rebels, it was to be expected that when the large number of troops which had recently left these shores arrived in India they would not only restore the supremacy of British rule, but place that rule on a 5rmer basis than ever. The special object of the meeting was to consider how they could best assist those who were sufferers, either directly or indirectly, by the mutinies. Large numbers of widows and orphans were deprived of their natural protectors. and there were, doubtless, many persons at Calcatta and Bombay from places in the interior who would gladly, if enabled to do so, return to England. Those who would become the recipients of this fund were individuals whoee husbands or fathers had been cut down by unmerciful and cowardly foee. At the tune when this rebleUlon broke out it was considered, on account of the heat, almost imposcible to move troops in India, hut, notwithstanding these ddi~culties, the utmost heroism had been evinced, and nothing could be more entitled to addmiration than the bulldeg courage exhibited by our brave troops. (Cheers.) The Boy. B. S. Moctxy moved the following resolu- That the inhabitants of Deptford h3virg watched with great anxiety and psinful interest the progress of the mutiny and rebellion in India, are improeed with the fuUest sense o horror and iudignation at the brutal outrages an d foul atrocities perpetrates upon their feUow-countrymen and countrywomen by the mutineers, aud take thl3 opportunity. In paublo rmeeting asembled, to tender their united condolence to those who have been bereaved of their relatives and friends also to express thelv cordial ssmpathy with thoee wheOe homes hare bee devastated, and who bavebeen so rearfolly persecuted by this hertrending calamity." General ANGERSTEIN seconded the resolution, which was adopted. Mr. JOEN WADE moved- ^ That this meeting, with a view to alleviate the wanta and di. teeses of thbse who have thus been rednced from a state of affluence to that of the greatest penury, feel it to be a bounden dutyto co-oper. ate with theRight lon. the Lord Mayor of London and th comrittee of the Ceatral Relief Fund, by rasing subscriptions from their feDlowtownsmen in aid of the fund." Mhr. STONE seconded the resolution, whicli was supported by MIr. TO0VNSE\D, M.P., and agreed to. Mr. MATTEws nmoved, and Mr.LIrDDIARD seconded, the appointment of a local committee; and after a vote of thanks to the chairman the meeting separated. WORCESTER. A meeting was held yesterday in the Guildhtel, Worcester, for the purpose of considering the propriety of presenting a loyal addreasto her Mlajesty the Queen expressive of regret and horror at the cruel and monstrous outrages committed by the mutineers in India, also of sympathy for the suffering of their fellow countrymen in India, and their dutiful desire to acquiesce in such measures as Her Majesty may deem necessary for re-establishing trarnquillity in her Indian dominions. A subscription had previously been opened in the city on the recommendation of the Mayor, and it was proposed that this meeting should also consider the best means for promoting it. The Mayor presided, and the Dean of Worcester, Mr. Lasett, M.P., Sir E. A. H. Lechmere, and Sir C. Hastngs were among those present. The MAYoR having opened the business of the day and read a letter from Mr. 0. Iicardo, M.P., expressing his sympathy with the object of the meeting, Sir E. A. H. LECMEIRE moved the first resolution, as follows- "That this meeting desres to express the utmost indignation aud horror at the mutiny ot nesrly the wholeBenga army, whichx has us ourred under circumstances evincing the basest treachery and the doopest 1ngratltude, and has been atained by the ludlscriximlte slaughter. withunbeard-of crnIelty, of many hundreds of Briti3h subJects-stefenoelese men, women, anxd children. Sir CHARLES HASTINGS, seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. The City Sheriff, Mr. J. STALLARD, moved- "That, considering tu the course of the xuuiny great numbers or British subjeans in udia have been deapoiled of their property, and thereby reduced to destitutlon, or are deprived of their natural support and potcHtion by the marder of their husbands or parent, this mneeting desires to expreu the greatest sympathy for their sufferings and pledges Itself to assist in aUeviating them by prouxotihg a subScription for the national fund now being raised for the reliet of the sufferers, either svil or militarY." This was seconded by Mr. Alderman EVANS, and carried. LMr. J. W. LxA moved, and Mr. W. E_NNICic seconded the following reselution:- That this meeting desires huumbly ta acknowledge with grateful heart the favour of Almighty God which has bDaa sO ignally rouncha3Sed to Britisn arms in the numerous battl6s fought by our breve troops agatust the mutineern, especially for tbe signal act0ot divine favour oonferred upon our arms tn the late glorious vistory aad cap. ture of Delhi: and humbly desires to expres Itin earnest rsrYer that tr3nquiutlymay speedtlybe restored tolacdb aud a conclurlonthereby putto the shedding of blood.' The Very Rev. the Dean of WORCESTER then mnoved that the following loyal and dutiful address on the Indian mutiny be presented to the Queen, and that the Mayor be requested to sign the same on behalf of the city, and to transmit it to the Home Secrotary for prosentation to Her Majesty:_ 1 TO TrEE Ql;EEN'S MOST EXCELLEN;T ML-UbSrY. May it pleaes your Majesty,- Wo, the utayor snd Citizens ot Worceeter. in common hall asaerbled, beg leave humbly and dutifusy to tepresent to your Majety that we have heard with sorlow and indignation of the mutiny Ywhich has Dpread through nearly the eutire native army of Bengal, and of the unheard-or atroclty wlth which the mutineers have rathlessly murdered In ludia many hundreds of men, women, and children, the faithful seryants andsubjects of onr Maiesty. While sympathIIng in the profound grief with which this calamity bas afficted Your Majesty, we beg leave to erpress our bearielt joy at the greet and happy success with whioh Divine Providence has seen fit to blOMS your majesty'armszthroughout the arduonsn sruggle carred on by your Majesty's fcrcets in India, and which hcs been so especally evrincedin the glorious victory aDd capture of DelhL W humbly desire to exprees our loyal and dutifua cncucrrence iu Ell measures which your b ajesty may deem necessary In order to extingulsh thli unnatura mutiny, and a cheerful compliance wsith such demands a, may devolve upon Your Majesty 's peoole in order to the carrying out of measues for the restoration of tranquility to India, which we sincerely pray may spedily be permanently established under the be. aignant utle of Your Maieaty." The rev. gentleman, with regard to the distribution of the fund now being raised, said there was a general belief prevalent that the subscriptions would exceed what would be required for the relief of the scfferers in India, that the famjilies of the soldiers who bad been sent out would be by far the greatest sufferers, and that their claims should be duly considered. By a wise and considerate determination no women or children had been allowed to accompany the troope despatched to India. Those troops must be detained in India several years, and their wives and children, from whom they had been thus suddenly separated, were left unprovided for. He trusted, therefore, that a strong appeal would be made to the committee of the fond in London, in order that some portion of the fands raised might be applied to the relief of the wives and children of those who had gone out to fight our battles. Mr. ALDRICH seconded theresolution. A discussion then took place with reference to the BUggestion of the Dean, which terminated in the adoption of a resolution requesting the Mayor to address the committee in London, commen dig the clains of the wives and families of the soldiers sent to India to their consideration. Mr. LAsLTrr, M.P., supported the adoption of the ad dress. It was the duty of Englishmen in this crisis to rally round theThrone, and he rejoiced to see the unanimity with which the proposition tor establishing the Relief Fund had been met. This was not the place to discuss the cause of the mutiny, but he hoped that in future education in India would be made national, that a new form of government would be introduced, and a new system established. It was the opinion of all that India had been misgoverned. We had had possession of it for a century, but education and Christianity had not progressed as they ought to have done undersantenlightened and Christian rule. He could not help expressing his belief that if the Government of this country had had a little foresight a great deal of the bloodshed which we now deplored would have been prevented. Early in the last session a member of thi House of Comnmons called the attention of the Government to the state of India, and mioved the appointment of a committee of inquiry, but the commnittee was refused. Had it been granted he believed much blondshed would bave been avoided. It was his firm opinion that we must have a free government iu India, aud that the charter granted to the East India Company about four years ago ought to be put an end to, Sir C. HAsTlNos here interposed, observing that they hld not met to discuss the question of the government of India. Mr. LALSTXTr said, if he were considered out of order he would not make any further observations on that subject. He then expressed his acquiescence in the object of the meeting, and sat down hoping that this country would be placed in a position honourable to a Christian land. (Cheers.) On tbe motion of Mr. I3..C, banker, seconded by Mr. WZBB, merchant, a committee was appoisited to collect subscriptions, and a vote of thanks having been awarded to the Mayor, the meeting broke up.

LORD STARZrY, M.P., OX THE EDUCATIZOW OP AIECEX9H4IOS. (From the AraTcncstcr Guardlan of yesterday.) The fourth anniversary aoerirc of the wigan Mechebrnh h8titution waas held in the Pablic-hall, Wigan, on Taesday i evening. In the absence of Mr. F. S. Powell, Al.P., (president of the institution), Mr. H. Woods (Vice-President) occupied the chair, and there was a Yer arge and highly respectable gathering of inhabitants of tea town of all claass, The secretary of the institution red the annual report, which was very favourable, recording a considerable increase of members and the effective workuig of the various claes. Lord STANLEY, MP., who on rising was loudly cheered after expressing his satisfaction at the prosperity of the in. stiution, said:-In material enterprise Lanca4hire stands confessedly at the head of the English countiesa in general intelligence and mental proficiency I think (though on that point I admit that I may be a partlal witne8s) we are entitled to no lower place; in regard to, educational develop. ment, of the extent to which place3 e teachig both for old and young exist and are attendad among us when compared with those of other districts wsrhave, I am bound to own it, many rivals, and perhaps evea some snperiors. But we possess advantages whioh onght to' make us winners in that honourable competition. The resr-kable concentration of population within a smali spes (doing away 'with that great diffliculty of thinly peopled counties, the distance which all learners, and especially children, mnst travel over to reach their place of meeting)-the nature of ocoupation here (I refer to that whilch takes place in factories), less exhausting in general, whether to young or old, than ordinary field labour-above all, the far greater possitility of rising in the world, the almost certainty that talent if coupled with steadiness will prove a marketable commodity-the knowledge which we living in these arts have that one-half at least of the inen who have =een most successful in business were men-who began with nothing,these are sll circumstances which tellapowerfully in our favour, augmuenting the chances of success, but, I mnust say it, enhancing at the same time the discredit of failure. It seems to me that the deficiencies of popular school teachng may be sunmed up generally under four heads. We have to complain of-L The insufficient nlumber of schools existing; 2. Their inferior quality in many cases; 3. The too early age at which children leave school; 4. Their irregular attendance even during the years when they are supposed to bounder instruction. I need not point out that each of these causes of failure acts upon and enhances the cthers; so that a theorist who should choose to dwell excluaively on any one, and ascribe all the rest to that, might really make out a plausible case. Of the four wants or deSciencies which I have noted, that which has been the most loudly talked about is precisely that in which the greatest nimprovenient has taken place. I mean the insufficient number of schools. What are the facts? Prince Albert stated, in his speech at the London conference, that while in half a century population has only doubled itself within these islands, the number of schools has increased as 14 to 1; that in 1801 the number of schools in England and IV-ales was between 3,000 and 4,000, while in 1851 it had riecn to 46,000, and that while the proportion of day scholars to the entire population was, in 1S18 1 to 17, it was in 1S33 1 to 11, and ia 181 1 to 8. Of the second defect, the inferior quality of schools, it is impossible to speak eLcept in general terms. Here there Is, no doubt, much to be amended; but here, also, a goed deal has been done, ard it is here that the good results of Government inspection-forcedon noschool, but accepted by a vast majority of those existing-have been signally shown. (Applause.) It is when we come to the third and fourth I eads-to the early leaving of school, and the irregularity * f attendanee-that we find what I suspect is the most real and serious obstacle to improvement. I am not going into cetails,but I may point out in general terms what is said by some of the sehool inspectors on this subject in their last report. First, as to earlv leaving. In the York district aler. Watkins gives the proportion as follows :-Nearly threefourths (72 in 10) of the children at school were under 10; not one twenty-fifth (4 in 100) were over 13 years of age. Nearly one-half of the whole had been at school less than a year, only eight in 100 as much as three years. Of all the children at school in England and Wales, only 11 in 100 (about one in every nine) are over 12 years of age. You may say generally that the great mass of such children are under 10, and all except a small fraction under 12, at the time when their teaching is ended for life. Irregular attendance is universal. I believe, from the Land's-end to the Tweed, from Norfolk to Wales, there is not a single school teacher who has it not to complain of. The result is, that a state of things exists very singular, and deserving more notice than it has received. Lamentable as the ignorance is which arises from want of teaching, there is another kind of ignorance more lamentable still, that wlhich exists in those who have been taught-at least whose teaching has been paid for and given,-bat who have been taught too young, too discontinuously, and far too short a time to allow of any lasting impression being made. hly object is to point out what the facts cited seem to make clear, that the principal present obstacle to the spread of education lies in the indifference of the class most concerned. (Hear, hear.) You have existing in the upper and middle ranks of society a general convicti,n really held by ninny, and professed by almost all, that the existence of a class wholly untaught is a natiour,' reproach. (Heaer, bear.) Yon have not a corresponding conviction aniog the labouriang class, taken as a whole. Your supply Of educational machinery, imperfect as it may be, exceeds the demand ; yot have created facilities for popular teaching, but the inducement to make use of them has not been supplied in a proportionate degree. Until you can do that, be the moans employed what they may. success is impossible. NZow, what is the origin of that indifference ? Various causes might be assdgned, but for my present purpose it is enough to name one. There are no rneans of keeping up, far less of increasing, the little stock of knowledge acquired at schooL The school-teaching of the boy has no connexion with the after-life of the man. It is forgotten, bec-ause it is not kept up; it is not kept up (I don't affirm that this is the only reason, but it is an important one) because no adequate machinery exists for the purpose. Here, tben, comes in the function of the institute. (Hear.) Without a well-considered system of instruction for youths and men, the school system, by which, as we have seen, children only are taught, remains imperfect, and almost useless,-an ample foundation, but left uithout a superstructure. (Loud applause.) Institutions, then, of thiszkind, used, it may be, to some extent by the middle class also, but Open and available to that class for which they were primarl intendedthat of the working man-are a necessity of our time, and the question is not whether they shall be maintained, but how,-under what conditions of existence and with what securities for utility. And here, I doubt not, there is wide room for improvemnent. It is about 25 years since mechanics' institutes began to be set up in most of our great towvns; more than SO0 of them exist at present. Wo havo, therrf ore, both time enough and instances enough to enable us fairly to critictse their working. It is certain, on the one hand, that they have not fully answered the expectatioDs of their first founders i it Is unjust, on the other hand, to deny that they have achbeved a considerable degree of success. Their chief fault, I think, has been this-that, depending wholly for support on their popularity at the moment, they have been obliged too often to put mere amusement before instruction ; to rely on desultory occasional lectares, not on systematic class teaching; to fill their libraries with works which met the taste of the day, to the exclusion of works having a permanent usefulness and value. (Hear, hear.) Another error is, that they have aimed at too much; that they took on themselves an amount of educational work wholly disproportionate to the resources they could command,-an error which experience has tended to correct, but leading at the time to failure. The free public libraries established in our northern towns are always in demand; their reading-rooms are always fall; the vast majority of thosa who use them belong to the class of mechanics or artisans; and though a great deal has beenusaid about the preference shown for the lightest kinds of reading, I believe that works of mere amusemnent are only about one-balf of the whole number taken out. Nor do I apprehend, looking at the case of Liverpool, of Manchester. of Bolton, of Bury-I might take almost any town in this county of Lancashire-that a single instance can be alleged of an educational institute, framed upon a popular and unsectarian basis, which has failed either from waut of members to join it, or from want of funds to carry it on. My argument briefly is this,-that the school and the institate-callthem by vhat names you vwll-form parts of one whole; that their functions, though distinct, are ineparable; and that it is by strenuously promoting 'whatever efforts may be mnade for the improvement of adult teaching that we shall best remedy the greatest present defect in our school system. Adverting to the recent examinations under the Society of Arts and the Institutional Association, his Lordship said,-If it be true that 10 prises were eained among seven members of this institation, I think the Wigan lads have no reason to complain of either their want of skill or of good fortune. (Loud applause.) I should be glad to see the competitive system exterded by Governmuent ; but its amount is nothing to that of private employers. I was told lately by one of the heads of a great firn not far from Manchester that they were at that time employing tbree persons in theirhusioess each of wzhom had been an ordinary meebanic on weekly wages-each of whomn had risen from the ranks, and each of whom was at tbat time in receipt of a salary of 1,5001. a-year, which is just the pay of an Under-Secretary of State. (Applause.) That fact I verihtd. I suppose it is not an isolated instaune, and I mention it becanse we hear a little too m uch £x,U t the in- possibility of men in an old conntry like this rising above their actual position. W hy, I say that in that respect we are not an old country, but a new ooantry. (Ilear, h ear.) I affirm that America itself has no better pecmniary prize to ofier to the ambition of a working uan an n a bItha northern districts of ours. (Applanse.) Otber speakers, including M r.

OB3STRUCTIOXN TO THE TRAFFIC XtS THE-CITY. Mr. T.

The traffic of London, he said, was increasing every week, ard the main thoroughfares of the metropolis had become so overcrowded that it was a matter of difficulty to pass from one part of the city to another. Cabs were a great public convenience, but when they looked about and plied for hire in crowded thorotLghfares they were a constant cause of obstruction. The police authorities ought to prov-ide standing-room for a snffieient number of cabs to supply the wants of the metropolis. Mr. GRESE.HAIi seconded the motion. l)epaty Lor said he some time ago memorlalized the Court of Aldermen on this very subject. That body entertained his memorial, and went Into the matter very cheerfully and zealously, and they compHed with a suggestion of his and memorialized the Inland Bieveonue Commissioners to make it compulsory, upon the face Of the licenses, that ozonibuses and public vehicles should go through the new :trect. The Inland Revenue Comumsiseoners told the Court that they bad no power to ordor this to be done. Mr. HTDSON' said he hoped the matter would not bo refrrcrd to the Police Committee, and was of opinion that if the cabs were taken out of the streets very serious inconvonience wouild be experienced.

CHINA. (FROM OUB SPECIAL CO=FZPOXDZi.) SEANGRAI, AvG. 7. Mty last despatch was closed in hot haste, for the Formosa hove in siglit and in five minutes the boat was lowered, the letters were put on board, and we followed them with wistful eyes as they departed for "home." K'ext morning we were still out of sight of land, but the leadman's cry told that we were steaming in shallow waters. The morning's bath showed that the water was quite fresh and opaque, with rich alluvial soil. There were no other symptoms of land. We were in the mouth of the mighty river Yang-tse--" the child of the ocean "-the richest river in the world-richest in navigable water, in mighty eities, in industrioue human beings, in afluent tributaries, and in wide margins of cultivated lands of exhaust. less fertility. This vast expanse of turbid fresh water is satumated with the loam of fields 1,500 miles away. Portion of this rippling element was gathered upon those great mountain ranges of Central ABia where the Ganges, the Brabmaputra, and the two great rivers that irrigate Siam and Cochin China, and the fierce " yellow river" which pervades the north of China divide the drainage. The volume was increased by every mountain and every descending streamlet through 600,000 square miles of midland China. In its pride and in its strength the proud river fights for a little while with ocean himself for empire, drives back his salt waves, and establishes a fresh water province in the midst of his dominions. The Chinese love and venerate the Yang-tse as Chinese sons love and venerate their fathers. Philosophers draw their parables from his greatness and beneficence, historians chronicle his droughts and floods as events more important than the change of dynasties, and poets find his praises the most popular theme for their highest flight of song. Maiay a gentle dullard will think or say that I am Cstraining after the picturesque," or, more horrible still, " writing sentimnent," Don't believe it. I write rapidly what I feel earnestly. The Yangtse-Kiang is the mwt de l'enigme, the secret of the great Chinese puzzle. If I cannot make Mr. Doldr7ums, or Sir John Fathead, or General Crass understand the grandeur and the all-importance of this river, I shall never succeed in fixing in his skull one right idea about China. If he will study the geography of this empire as I have done, hour by hour, and day by day, with map, glass, and books of travel, collating the bad maps, and asking explanations from French missionaries and Chinese merchants, he may then say what he likes about my descriptions, for he cannot but share my conclusions. We had steamed for some hours in this sharLow sea, when a line, having length but neither breadth nor thickness, became just visible far away upon our left. As our course was tangential to this line it gradualy became more distinct. Then through our glasses we could see a level coast, well timbered with trees-no palns or Eastern forms of foliage, but such an outhne as we might trace on the banks of Essex or Lincolnshire. Between the river shore and the woodlands there was a margin of meadow land, where droves of cattle and flocks of sheep were depasturing, and everything around, except only the fierce sunshine, gave promise that we had escaped into an European climate. Then land upon the right grew into view, not the opposite bank of the Yang-tse-that is far out of sight-but an island which he is throwing up. From day to day he piles there the spoils he brings down from the midland provinces. The pilots say they can observe an increase every week. The Chinese are already planting bamboo there to give solidity to the rich alluvial aoil. A thousand squatters are ready to seize upon it and convert it into gardens immediately the tide shall cease to cover it. Fishing and carrying and convoying, a thousand junka and lorchas are scudding to and fro in the estuary. But we proceed not far up the channel of "the child of the ocean"-" the father of rivers"" the girdle of China." A checker-painted seamark (: hich wants only a telegraph upon it to make its usefulness complete) and a floating lighthouse mark the point where the last tributary to the Yang-tee Kiang, the river Wang Poo, joins its waters. Upon a low spit of land stands the desolate and amphibious looking village of Woosung. The place is not reaUy desolate and is not really amphibious, for large fortunes are constantly being made here (the golden sands of commerce accumulate as rapidly as the deposits of Yang-tse-Kiang), and the piles on which the buildings are erected lift them up out of danger of inundation. But the Chinese have a talent for giving an appearance of squalor to their towns and villages. I did not land, but proceeded immediately in a sanpan to Messrs. Dent's receiving-ship, which lies strongly anchoredfore andaftinthemouth of theriver. Time was when the Emily Jane was a floating garrison with a disciplined crew trained to gunnery and boarding practice. Her guns are still in very good order, but she isnot likely to test theirpowers; for the Mandarin junks are no longer her enemies, anid the pirates hold her in great respect. I am afraid she is a very wicked Emily Jane, for she Is crammed with opium, and the odour of the drug is strong in her spacious cabins. Your " Special Correspondent" ought to be above such base considerations; but temperance advocates have been known to relish a rump steak cooked upon the furnace fire of Broadwood's brewery, and I must own that when the frank and hospitable commander of the Emily Jane had responded to my letter of introduction by an invitation to join him in some well-cooled sauterne, a joint of capital Shanghai mutton, and a successfully concocted ice pudding-grateful contrast to the monotonous fare of a passenger steamboat-I did not look about me with so much flaming indignation as a total abstinence-from-opium advocate ought to have done. These cool drinks calm one's judgment. I shall return to this opium question hereafter-I hope in more serious and ratiocinative mood. After "tiflin" I left the Emily Jane, for the tide was making, and Shanghai is seven miles up this river Wang gPoo. At a distance of three miles, in the gray twilight, Shanghai looks like a distant view of Woolwich. The tall spars of the Pique frigate, the English and American steamers of war, and a fleet of merchant vesselas ive an air of life and bustle to the waters 6f this noble tributary to the Yang-tse-Kiang. Higher up, wheresa turn in the river gives an inland appearance, we see a multitudinous mass of junk masts, just as from Groonwich and Woolwich we see the spars of the ships that crowd our docks. All tells of a large commerce requiring a strong protection. In this indistinct light the " hongs" of the European settle.- ment loom like the ship slips at Deptford or Woolwich. It is only upon a near approach that they resolve themselvesinto fine finished buildings, eome columned like Grecian temples, some square and massive like Italian palaces, but all declaratorv that the rcs angusta domi is a woo unknown to Englishmen in China. The Engliish settlement at Shanghai is situate upon a bend of this river Wang Poo. Its boundaries are ita fortifications On one aide the Soo-choo river, which comes down from the great city Soochoo (the Birmingham of China) and fal into the Wang Poo, forms its limits. On the other side the Yang-kang-pang canal shuts it from the settlement allotted to the French. This French aLlotment extends up to the waUs of the Chinese city of Shanghai. The frontage upon the Wang Poo, between the Soo-choo river and the canal, is nearly a rmile in length, and the settlement extends backwards about half a mile. This space is divided into squares by six roads at right angles with the river, and three paralel to it, and in these squares are the residences and godowns of the commercial houses, each in its surrounding plot of ornamented ground. In the rear of aU is the Shanghai racecourse. I am so fortuinate as to be commended to the priiicely hospitality of Mr. Beale, whose capacity of entertainment is so large that he can allot a separate establishment to each guest. I occupy the rooms where Mr. Fortune stored his treasures and where he humg up that terrible double-barreUed gun which raked the decks of so many pirate junks. If I have succeeded in conveying to the reader any notion of this place, he will recognize in it the present mainstay and the future hope of our trade with Cnina. Almost yesterday the site of this handsome Anglo-Chinese city was paddyfelds and cotton grounds. In 1856 309 British ships of the tonnage 92,943 tons unloaded on the quays. Imports from the whole vorld to the amount of 3,010,5111. passed through the Custom-house, and in addition to these opium to the value of 4,624,3051. passed through this portal to the interior of China. Yet, notwithstanding this amount of legal and illegal imports, a further importation, 4,287,9901. in hard bulion,was requisite to settle the balance of trade with Europe and America, and to pay for the enormous amouat of tea and silk which China sent down to Shanghai, and Shanghai distributed to Europe, America, and Australia. This is something like prosperity-a single pori with an annual balance of four millions and a quarter in its favour. But for the opium the amount would have been nine millions. In the current year, according to all present appearances, the sum may reach 9,000,0001., even with the set-off of the opium; and but for this undesirable resource for hedging our losses the civilized world would have to find 14,000,0001. worth of silver to pay the Chinamen wvho supply this single port. It is impossible to predict this as a certainty. Perhaps the native Chinese merchants may overstand their market and the exports may be checked. All we know at present is that the Chinese have a tremendous silk crop, and are holding out formost extortionate prices; and that, although some houses hold their hands, there are others who think it can all be sent to Europe at a profit at the prices demanded, and are buying freely. In any other country this problem would meet a certain solution, but in China even this great export trade is as nothing. There is a competing home rmarket of 360,000,000 of people, and almost every labourer in the cities has his holyday silk tunic. True, it is small merit in an Englishman's eyes that this port of Shanghai is so productive to China that it drains us of our bullion, deranges our excbanges, and embarrasses our commerce. But it is a fact, and a very important fact. I am not now going to inveatigate why this so happens. I am not in a condition to speak authoritatively yet of the doings at the Pisin, the Taeping, and the Kan Customhouses, or to tell the mysteries of that c"rdon of Douanes which is drawn round this port, and prevents our goods from penetrating, with fair chance of competition, 60 miles into the interior. When I have succeeded or failed in getting near these places, and have got all the information I can gather, I shaU devote some very lengthy epistles to the great question of how to work our manufactures into China. At present I have no further purpose thaa to show what a commercially important place this port of Shanghai is, to fix it in the public mind so that in our dealings with the Court of Pekin it may hold its proper rank. Beyond the limits of the European settlement the rich alluvial plain on which Shanghai stands extends for 20 miles without a hillock. We must admire the fertility of the soil and the industry of the people, but there all our gratification must end. The roads are devious footpaths, and the coursms of traffic are dikes and drains falling rapidly to ruin. When the fierceness of the sun is a little moderated I walk about these fenny tracks as they wind more tortuously than the footways in the marsbes between Erith and Greenhithe. They all tell of better days. They are strongly paved with rough blocks of granite or of limestone, fortunately too solid to need repair. Small drains are crossed upon slabo of atone of many tons weight, and wider watercourses are crossed by bridges of stone built to last centuries. But where present or constant care is reQuired we see the evidences of a decrepit Government and an unsettled society. Reeds and bamboos choke the watercourses; somehave become dry which were navigable five years ago. Here we come upon the site of the Imperialist Camp. The canal which formed its defence in front is now a swamp. Thepeasant stillretainshishabitsof industry. The land is parcelled out into little patches of cotton; and as the plant must be sown wide, the interstices are filled with beans, or by some vegetable that will find a market in Shanghai. The senses are afflicted by open pans of human ordure, carefully preserved for manure ; and the proprietor, with a small bucket fixed at the end of a bamboo, is bringingtwater from the ruined canal to irrigate his little cotton garden. In all probability the Government has made the usual grant for sustaining that canal, for routine is constant in China as in England; but the Mandarin has embezzled three-fourths of the sum, and the contractor has expended one-half of the rest in bribes, and has pocketed the remainder. Cotton (yellow and white) is the general crop; but it is not all cotton. There are patches of maize, purple gingals, and leguminous plants of many kinds, but the staple of this district is cotton. At present the plant is a low woody plant about a foot high, a little like (with the exception of the stools) those young springs of an oak coppice which form such pleasant cover to shoot pheasants in early in October. In another month the flowers will be out, and a fortnight later the yellow pods of which the nankeen cloth is made will form and burst, and all the population will turn out to pluck them. The old women will sit under the eaves of their cottages cleaning and winding, which, indeed, is their normal occupation all the year through; the ablebodied part of the family having cleared their legunilnous crop, will plough up the ground, and either prepare lt for wheat, or, if the situation is favourable, will bank up the land and let in the water to prepare for rice. The wheat is off the ground in May or June, and the cotton is again sown. Thus three crops annually are obtained from this alluval plain. 0 Vice-Consul Harvey-docans uttriusque linguz -to whom the manners and the language of China are even as the manuers and the language of Paris or of London, tell me what means that more than usually pestilential stench. It seems to radiate from that decaying pepper-box-shaped tower, vihich, although not 20 feet high, we must by the courtesy of China call a pagoda. Undismayed, the energetic Vice-Consul, who sometimes acts as guide, philosopher, and friend, and expatiates with me over this maze, advances through a vapour so thick that I wonder the Chinese do not cut it into blocks and use it for manureand at a distance of five yards from the buildina puffed hard at his cheroot and said,- "That is the baby tower." "The - " said I, inquiringly. "The baby tower. Look through that rent in the stone-work-not too close, or the stream of effluvia may kill you. You see a mound of whisps of bamboo straw. It seems to move, but it is only the crawling of the worms. Sometimes a tiny leg or arm, or a little fleshless bone, protrudes from the straw. The tower is not so full now as I have seen it; they must have cleared it out recently." "Is this a cemetery or a slaughterhouse ?" "The Chinese say it is only a tomb. Coflins are dear and the peasantry are poor. When a child dies the parents wrap it round with bamboo throw it In at that window, and all is done. Wien the tower is full the proper authorities burn the heap and spread the ashes over the land." There is no inquiry, no check. The parent has power to kill or to save. Nature speaks in the heart of a Chinese mother as in the breast of an English matron. Bulat want and shame somnetimes shout louder stil. There is a foundling hospital in the Chinese city with a cradle outside the door and a hollow bamboo above it. Strike a blow upon the bamboo, and the cradle is drawn inside. 1f it contain an infant, it is taken and cared for, and no questions asked. There is also a system of domestic slavery in China. At an early age u child is worth dollars, a father or mother may for imoney delegate their own absolute power-delegate without losing it-for, although the father may have sold his son to a stranger, or although a mother may have sold her daughter to prostitution-and concubines in China are only thus to be obtained-the duty from child to parent rernains unimpaired, and is strictly performed. The incentives thus offered by Mammon and the alternative Proneredvby ti e charity may save lives that would otherwise be destroyed; but thls baby -tower i a terribl in titu tion. It stancd there, close to the walls of a crowded city, an intrusive invitation to infanticide. I hare paid one hurried visit to the Chinese city, but must postpone any description of it until I have opportunity to see it thoroughly, and this will not be for some wreeks. Ever since my arrival here I have been trying to organize an expedition into the interior, but everyone is afraid of fever and ague and sunstrokes, and talks of two months henice, when I hope to be thinking of coming home. At last I have found a companion in an ardent missionay who speaks the language well. I have purchased a modest Chinese wardrobe, and a barber is deliberating upon the fabrication of a toupee, with a handsome tail attached. With the aid of Chinese spectacles, which are always four incheB ill diamaeter, I flatter myself I a so disgised that my own houtekeeper, with her best 6pectacles on, would not recognize me. I have written a loDg news-letter withgxut one word of news in it; and yet it would be easy to write columns, for one half of the people here ara reporting news from the interior, and the other half are contradicting it. People -ay that the rebellion is dying out. They expect every day news that Chin-Eiang-Foo is retaken, by the Imperialists, and opinions are strong that Nankin will not long hold out. This, If true, is very important news for us, for it clears the Yang-tse-Kiang and the Imperial Canal, where our operations both for war and commerce were most likely to be complicated by the preseuca of these insurgents. I believe the news to be correct to a certain extent, and in a certain sense. If the rebellion be no wearing out it is shifting. Chin-Kiang Poo and =ankin are consumed. The locust has eaten every leaf, and must take another flight or die. " Wait a while, all will come right-ten years, perhaps," has always been the Chinese view, and they think the time is now near. They have tested this rebellion, and find it has no root. The old Chinese families do not join it, the merchants have no confidence in it, no literati except one degraded graduate has yet gone over. Therefore they think it will never be more than an excuse for brigaudage, and that it will always be local and transitory. This is the opinion of the Chinese hereabouts; and as we are within 200 mniles of the seat of rebel government, their opinions deserve some attention. I question, however, whether they know much of what is passing in the South. The Remi starts on the 9th with the mail for England, and a cargo of silk which they say will give the Peninsular and Oriental Company 9,0001. freight. I hope to write you next from Ningpo, which effy I intend to reach by a semicircular route tbrough the inland parts of Chekiang. 0 THE IMPERIAL CANAL, Auo, 10. At the close of my last despatch, while the authorities at Hongkong were resolving upon a formal blockade of the river,-a measure which was convenient to the fleet, and which the ripened rice harvest renders not very important to the Cantonese. -I was about to employ the interval of Lord Elgin's absence in gathering a little experience in the interior. On the appointed day Mr. Edkins, the missionary, Dr. Dickson, of Canton, and myself started in three sauchau boats, with a fair flood tide up the Wangpoo River. Our object was to reach iingpo through the network of internal canals, and without crossing the bay. This is a journey never yet made evea by the missionaries, and Mr. Edkins regards it as a pioneering expedition preparatory to future labours. Our first stage Is to flangehau, and thus far our boatmen havecovenantedtoconveyus. These sauchan boats are somewhat like the larger gondolas which go outside into the Adriatic. The cabins are fitted up with no little pretension. Mine had plate.glass windows; mnuch carving and some gilding had been lavished upon it. There was a joss-house with a vacant niche for any idol I might fancy to put there, and two ecclesiastical candlesticks, uPOn the spikes whereof I might, if I had pleased, burn any sized joss-sticks or wax candles. The extent of this, my habitation for the next six days, was however not great-it was seven feet six inches square. Nor wa3 there provision for effeminate luxury. There was a locker within which I might put my most Important baggage, on which I could spread my bamboo matting, and over which I hung my mosquito curtains; there was a snmal table and two camphor-wood stools. What more can a man want? There was a box, with " Fortnum and Mason's' name upon it in one corner, a modicam of sherry and Bordeaux and a dozen of soda water in another corner, and a revolver and doublebarrelled gun handy to the grip. The use of the firearms is, I believe, solely this; the boatmen will not go on at night unless theyknow you have them. The adroitness of the Chinese thieves will justifv their contempt for any barbarian swell mobsman. Mr. Edkins not long since found that some one had during his slumbers crept in at the cabin window, taken his keys out of his pocket, opened his trunk, and abstracted all his dollars, leaving the trunk open, and nothing else, not even the proprietor, disturbed. But I do not hear of any open piratical attacks up the country, and you do not want firearms to drive away a thief. The first thing he would steal wcld probably be the gun and the revolver. Off we go, +then, up ilis tributary of the Yang-tseKiang. About four miles an hour is our pace, propelled as we are by one gigantic oar, worked over the stern by three men, curved in the handle, and made to perform in the 'water the evolution we call skulling. We paas through the Europeaa shipping, by the floating bath, and into and along moored tiers of junks, which nLay almost vie in numbers with the shipping In our pooL .Hundreds of these ply between Shanghai and Amoy, bringing sugar here and taking cotton back. A thousand others will start this season for Shantung, and will carry with them 100,000 pieces of our gray shirtings-a demand owing, the merchants say, to exceptional causes. In an hour we are clear of the environs of Shanghai, and we look to see the river contract to the proper decent dinensions of a third-rate stream. Nothing of the sort. Seven miles up the Wangpoo is still quite a mile in width, and for the greenness and flatness of its banks, and the European outline of foliage, we might be a little below Gravesend. Resenting, perhaps, my smal respect for him as a third-class river, the Wangpoo treats us to a capful of wind just as the tide is finished, and the boatmen incontinently run into a creek, which leads up to a village possessing a high pagoda and a Buddhist monastery. On our walk to the village-quickly speeding, for we hope to reach the pagoda before the sun has set-I notice the same lavish expenditure of labour in paving the footpaths and bridging the dykes with slabs of limestone or granite which struck me in the neighbourhood of ShanghaiL The pagoda, from the galleries of which nothing is visible bau the limitless fat plain and the frequent vi1lages, is of course a thing comparatively of yesterday. The Buddhists brought the form from India not long before the birth of Christ; but these products of untiring toil, these mounds and dykes, these countless masses of enormous stones brought from afar-still more those practical, matter-of-fact, Sabbathless, business-loving, pleasure-despising habits of mind which under a less corrupt and depressing system of rule would lead the present race of Chines 3 to sustain these works and to create others-that insensibility to play of fancy, yet love of quaint conceits and forced antithees-that incapacity to feel grace and beauty, yet strong appreciation of mere geometrical symmetry-that complete disconneexon from (not divergence from) all the modes of thought and veicles of thought, traditions, and superstitionr of other nations-these things suggest a train of dreamy thoughts, and send the mind wandering back to times almost as old as that setting sun. May it not ba that we have here a not very degenerate specimen of a eivilization that covered the whole earth before our traditions begin-which spread and flourished before the Semitic or the Indo-Germanic r had beig-which has left its traces in Indta and in England, in MIexio and in Italy- in Cal- - fornia and in Gireece, in Brithany and in Normandy, and in the most remote islands of the ocean; pilers of mounds and hewers of mountains, builders of Babels whose might was quenched we know not how, and whose sparse descendants we can just trace under the names of Egyptians, Pelasgians, or Etruscans mingling with new races and losing their identity. We passed the night upon the wide and troubled waters of the Whangpoo with less of meekness than befitted the peaceful character of my companion. I inssted upon starting as soon as the flood tide made. Every wave seemed to break under the flat bottom of my boat, and she rolled and quivered and creaked as though she would have quoted MIencius to rebuke my impatience. But the night was very beautiful. It was so hot that I lay outside vwitti my head against the broad junk-like prow, aud eve i the rushing wind brought no coolness; the round moon looked down in all her splendour, but did not dim the light of the big stars. Ever as one of our sister boats went ahead, the oar oscillating to and fro at her stern, produced a sheet of phosphoric radiance which neither moon nor stars could pate. Sometimes we neared the banks, and then the monotonous croak of the frog was heard, and iti sheltered places flights of fireflies, like flakes of diamond, fluttered up and down among the oottoa plants, and then also myriads of mosquitoes of great stature came off and sounded their declarations of war in my ears. We were not alone on the Wangpoo. On the contrary, there were neyer lem thai a, hundrel §41, in sight. Some were beating up and others were coming down, the strong monsoon urging them swiftly against the tide. Sometimes collisions seemed imminent, but a little shouting and all went clear. From 3 o'clock till 8 I slept, and awoke to find myself moored against the village of Min-Hang. While at this village I fell in with a Chinese physician, who had escaped from Nankin when it fell into the hands of the rebels. He was the first specimen of a Chinese gentleman I had seen. The villages in this neighbourhood contain many fugitives from the rebel districts. The Govermment lodges them in the temples and allows them 30 cash (about 3d.) a-day, -wherewith, at the present prices, they cannot buy even a sufficiency of rice. Of course disease is common among them, and this benevolent old gentleman devotes himself to their care. He came on board my boat and we had a long chat. He insists that the key of the Yang-tseKiang, Chin-Kiang, has been recovered by the Imperialists; for his friends at Soo-choo have written to him to say so. I doubt tbis, however; for if this decisive event had happened the Governmentwould certainly have announced it at Shanghai. His view is that the rebellion is dying out. Iele Jays the locusat have destroyed it, having especially come upon those provinces where the rebels hold their sway. He does not rest his expectation upon the Imperial armies, for he says the rebels are robbers and murderers, accustomed to every artifice, and adepts in aU villany. All the loyal people can do is to hem the conflagration round and wait till it burns out. These are the opinions of a well-informed Chinese gentleman, who has seen much more of tbese rebels than the Europeans who have written upon the subject. About 48 hours Is the longest I period that any European has been among them, and they have never invited any closer intercourse. MIr. Edkins interpreted for me these sayings of my Chinese acquaintance with no great satisfaction. The missionaries still bang their hope upon this rebel cause. The facts are unpromising, but Btil they hope. Devastation and bloodshed track the course of these insurgents wherever they go, but these are only necessary incidents of civil war. The ruin of those public works which are to China what I their dams are to the Dutch mark where these rebels are, and where tbey have been. Still more widely extended ruin icUoows upon the exhaustion of the Imperial treasury. The two great rivers, no longer restrained by the great artificial embankments, now suffered to aecay, are altering their courses and devastating tracts as large as European kingdoms. Perhaps a man whose fervid religious zeal is akin to that which animated Joshua or Gideon may see in all this b,ut the will of God working to a gareat end, but the religious facts are not encouraging. The noriial head of the movement, claimed as a missionary convert, has sought no communication with any Christian teacher. He boasts himself the Sovereign of the whole Earth, calls himself the younger brother of Jesus C hrist, and claims to have constant personal intercourse with the Almighty. His second in command, the King of the East, blasphemously styled himself the Holy Ghost; but he has been slain in interneCne conflict, and the great leader, or his counsellers, proved their vigour and their Christian humanity by butchering two thousand of his adherents in cold blood. This does not look like a hopeful result of a missionary conversion, nor does it give much promise of temporal success to the insurrectionary movement. But then these reformers put to death the "idolators," whether they call themselves the priests of Buddha or the missionaries of the Pope; they forbid opium-smoking under pain of death, and tobacco-smoking under pain of blows; theyappear to have read, although they have misinterpreted, the sacred books which the missionaries distribute. Amid the outpourings of blood,in famine and pestilence, in the wrack of all the physical good which antiquity has wrought, our missionaries think they see a hope for the religion of the Bible. We must not expect from men whose zeal sends them forth among the heathen a sober and chastened faith ; but, with all allowance for their strongly militant position, it Is hard to understand how o faint and indefinite a hope can blind their eyes and deafen their ears to the material woes which this rebellion has produced. Yet we have men here wbo have gone among them in the same spirit as Samuel went to Saul, and who have produced scandal even among their own body by urging their ruffians to go forth and kill. Mr. Edkins is a man of very different spirit to such as these IUpon the testimony of the linguists of Paris and of the Chinese hero I know him to be one of the greatest of Chinese scholars, and from my own intercourse with him I can say that he is fairly read in the sciences and well acquainted with Western literature. He has undertaken the task of showing theChinese that we have a literature, and thus disabusing them of that contempt which extends itself to our faith. His American coadjutor, Dr.Macgowan, undertakes to instruct their graduates in the myateries of the electric telegraph, and their pilots in the law of storms. Missionary labours thuis directed must result in good. Your medical misionaries, such as Dr. Lockhart and Dr. Parker, command the gratitude and goodwill of the people. Men of learning like Mr. Edkins and Dr. Macgowan gradually compel the respect of the literati. These men are ploughing a soil in expectation of a seedtime which is not yet. To the missionary Eocieties of England and America I would say hve tibi erunt artes,-lgnorant declaimers in bad Chinese have no success in China. Their preaching is foolishness in more than the Apostolic sense; but this practical and conceited people onlyjeer and blaspheme. Yet I have found even the higher class of missionaries hoping against hope that the rebels may succeed, and that they may turn out to be Christians. .1 have objected to them the material miseries the Insurrection has caused; they have quoted against me MIr. Cousin's defence of war, which is no other than that war is in itself a good, and that the abaridgment of longevity is not necessarily an evil. When I reply that this is all that could be best said by an infidel philosopher against a certain article in the Decalogue, they have replied that notwithstanding this commandment the Israelites were enjoined to exterminate the Canaanites I reply that to establish an analogy between the cases it will be necessary to admit Taeping-wang's pretensions to direct personal intercourse with God the Father. No missionary is prepared for this admission, and our argument closes. With these men it is a hope and a sympathy which they cannot but feel and cannot justify. With some others it is a truculent spirit of partisanship embittered not a little by envy a^nd hatred of the merchants. I know no more of the rebels than others who write about them do-that is, I know very little indeed; but having talked the matter over daily and in all societies for the last two months, I know pretty weU lwhat the views of the officials, merchants, and missionaries are upon the subject. Meanwhile, my Chinese guest is sipping his tea, looking through my opera-glass, and condoling with me upon my sad condition in not being able to understand Chinese. I hope I omitted no point of ceremonial with him. Wben he begged to present me vith hisspectacles,which I hadaffectedtoadmire, and pressed them npon mewith as much earnestness and sincerity as a IDowning-street secretary assures you he is your most obedient, humble servant. I declined the gift according to Chinese forms, but I confess I could not prevail upon myself to offer him my opera glass. Human nature is weak, and the China gentleman's admiration was evidently very strong. We parted with ahundred chin-ehina. Up the flood tide of the Wangpoo Dr. Dickson's boat separated from us last night, and is not come up. The boatmen talk of perils from pirates or foundering in the storm. We wait and send back runners, and learning no tidings conclude he has returned toShanghai. Two large navigable tributaries fall in, but the river above is not much decreased in width. After some hours' further voyage the WVangpoo loses its name and form. It divides into two equal channels, one of which descends from the right, and comes down from a string of lakes that extend to Soo-choo; the other is our way. Triburaries and canals now come quickly in, showing how woonderfully ramified is the internal water communication of this land. Of course the volume of the stream contracts as we ascend. At night the action of the tide is but faintly felt, and we anchor in a channel about 50 yards wide. In the moonlight Dr. Dickson's boat comes up with a tale of adventure. The next day was a day of canals and great cities. (To be continued.)

FORBIGN INTELLIGENCE. FRA-'NTCE. (FROM OUII OWN CORXRSPONDENT.) The following appeared in our second edition of yes tcrAav :-I !'AUIS, WEDNESDAY, OCT. 28, 6 P.m. The Mexican Government has signified its intention to accept the mediation of France and Eagland in the quarrel with Spain, on the condition, however, that M. Lafragun shall be previously received by the Court of Madrid in his official capacity. The negotiations will be carried on, I believe, in Paris, and no doubt Lord Clarendon has quite enough to occupy him at this moment without having thu also on his hands. The matter seems now reduced to little more than a question of etiquette, and it is hardly probable that, when such interests are at stake, and when Spain has so much to risk, and Mexico, comparatively speaking, so little, the Cabinet of Madrid will show less prudence than its predecessor, or will be diverted from its purpose by the clamour of a few journals that are known to be under the influence of claimants whose demands on the Mexican Government are very questionable. The facilities for injuring the trade of Mexico are by no means so great as some years ago, and Vera Cruz rnay now be blockaded without the internal commerce being seriously affected, whilethe loss to Spain would be ninense. There is no great confidence expressed in the durability of the new Cabinet, at least in its present form. The most influential memberof it is, beyond doubt, M. Mon, and from him, I believe, the foreign bondholder would have the best chance of a settleinent. When Minister of Finance in 1845 he had the ability aud courage to introduce something like order into the financial system of Spain, and he would have completed his work by a stiU better tariff reform but for the opposition of Catalonia, which is always held in te7roremn over every Spanish Ministry. Martinez de la Rosa belongs to the past, and might have been more wisely left in some dignified but sinecure post. With these exceptions, and perhaps Armero, the other Mfinisters are unknown; they are probably taken from the Government offices, and wiU be kept until some bon4.fide men are found. It is thought that the Cortes will be dissolved. It is denied that General Narvaez intends to quit Spain, and fix once more his residence in Paris. He will, I hear, remain at MDadrid, and take hbi seat in the Senate. Some of M. Mlon's friends affirm that he has declared his intention to give his support to the new Cabinet, and that neither he nor his political friends will offer a factious opposition. It is not improbable that he has made use of such magnanimous language; how it wiU be carried out remains to be seen. Despatches were received per last post by the French Government from Pondicherry. They are up to the 25th of September, and at that date the condition of the French eatablishments is announced as excellent. It is announced that, in consequence of a recent agreement between the Powers interested, the Conference for the settlement of the Moldo-Wallachian question wil begin its sittings early in November. The dissatisfaction at the incidents that have taken place in Constantinople stiU continues, and it is now believed that Lord Stratford has this time not merely consulted his own wishes, but has acted in accordance with his instructions. At the French Foreign-office it is said that M. de Thouvenel will have unlimited leave of absence, and that, in aU probability, only a Chargd d'Affaires will be appointed ad interim to take his place. The foUowing is given as a correct version of the speech addressed by Sir H. Bulwer, the Commissioner in the Principalities, to a deputatlon of members of the Wallachian Divan, who, with the Vornik, M. Koghal-Niltchano, welcomed him on his recent arrival in Bucharest:- " Gentlemen,-I have listened to the address which has just been presented to me with all tho attention to which its kind expressions entitle it, and if it be trme, as a cele. brated personage is supposed to have said, 'that speech was given to men (and especially to diplomatists) In order to conceal their thoughts,' I shall at the present moment make but an imperfect and incorrect use of it, for I cannot find words capable of concealing the profound emotion which Ifeel at the more thbn cordial reception with which youhave honoured my arrival in this Principality. This, gentlemen, Is, as yousay, my first visitto your country, but allow meto assure you that you have long engaged my sympathies; and now that you are commencing a new chapter in your history I earnestly desire that my name may be honourably insibed in Its pages. You will easily understand this desire, for I represent a Government which cannot be otherwise than interested in the development of your resources; and, for my own part, what task could I wish for more useful than that of improving your condition? What glory groeter than that of living In your remembrance? I feel, however, that while speaking to you in the language of affection, I ought also to use that of sincerity. I entreat you, then, not to imagine that the whole future of a people is ever made in a single day; I entreat you to believe that you will never gain any object more quickly by Impatient haste in its pmsuit-thetree which isthe longest in arriving at perfection is the longest untouched by decay; and the tortoise, challenged by the hare (you will remember the old fable), won the race. I must own, however, that in looking out for some trait which might inform me as to your national character, I fancy I have perceived one from which I draw a favourable augury as to your fature destiny. You have hitherto only constructed one road, It is true, but that road is an excellent one; you have hitherto had only one well-paved street, that is also true . but that street is better paved than most of the streets In the finest towvns in Europe. You have thus impressed on my mind an idea that your genius does not so much lead you to undertake many th'ugs as to do well what you do undertake. The progress of a nation guided by such a principle is continuous, for the step of its people is sure. " Every epoch In history has indeed its task; and the true art of polities in a nation, as well as in an individual, is'justly to appreciate the occasion offered, using every effort to obtain that which is possible, wasting neither time nor strength after that which is impossible. lIeed I then say that Europe, in asking your wishes, will judge you according to your sense? " Since my arrival, gentlemen, many persons have questioned me as to the duties of the Commission, and those of the Divans; seeing many of your deputies present, I seize this occasion to explain myself on such points. After a great struggle, now happily terminated, the Powers most interested in the welfare of Europe assembled in congress at Paxis, turned their attention to the Principalities, and the desdre of those Powers was to maintain therights and dignity of tiea Ottoman Empire, and improve as much as possible the condition of the Principalities, according tothe ideas and wants of the different classes which constitute their society. In order the better to form a clear and correct opinion on this subject, those Powers appointed a Commission for visiting these countries. " This Commission was instructed to obtain information from every source, and, in order to aid Its labours, It was determined that a Divan should be convoked in each Principality, as an oran of the particular wishes of that Principality, and as a body capable of answering any questions that the Cormmission might desire to put to it. Each Divan, moreover, is to be divided into committees of classes; these committees are called upon to express separately the particular wants of each class, as conjointly they will be able to express the general w shes of the Moldo-W=allachian pcople. I We, gentlemen, as Commissioners, have no other duty to perform than that of framing our report according to the lan which has been traced out for us; you, gentlemen, have no other part to perform than that of aiding us in making our report a correct one. Such is our reciprocal position, and, as we cannot exceed the Emits of our part, so you, gentlemen, should not exceed the limits of yours. In speaking thus I give you the best proof of mny friendship; and I am, gentlemen, your sincere friend. I do not, indeed, promise that you will obtain all you desire-that is not the fate of mortals; neither do I promise to share all your ideas, for I can never renounce the independence of my own opinions; hut, being persuaded that the goodwill of the Powers wil acoord all that your experience points oct as beneficial, and which their prudence and experience consider compatible weith your decrEee ot enliguenment, your geographical position iD the midst of Europe, and the suzeraiet of the Sublime Porte, I can assure you, as far as I a1 personally concerned, that my viewvs will be expressed honestly, indepenldently, and con-I s^ientiously, and that, gnided by my reason and mv duty they will be also influenced by the interest with which you~ Important works are to be commenced at Vincennes next season. A vast space of land, extending on the right of the Castle down to the Aili.pry Hospital, wiU be purchased, anad this ground will be coinected with the square by means of a bastioned enclosure, and will contain a large park of artillery. Thus the Emperor is every cLay making Paris stronger against revolutionary risings.

For some months past I have not sent you any information on the subject of the conflict still existing between Denmark and Germany with reference to the course pursued by the former towards the German Duchy of Holstein. The simple reason was that there was no new fact to report of sufficient importance for it to obtain admission into your columns. This conflict is, however, at length about to enter into a fresh phase, and to approach nerrer to the magnitude of a question of European interest, inasmuch as this Government has just instructed its representative at the Federal Diet in Frankfort to lay the whole matter before that body, and to apply to the Austrian representative there for his co-operation in this affair, so specially interesting to Germany. This being the case, I will give you now a resumg of what has taken place in the Dano-German conflict during the last three months, In compliance with the repeated and urgent representations of the German Powers in behalf of the Duchy of Holstein, the Danish Government convoked the Estates of Holstein for an Extraordinary Diet, which was restricted to the period of four weeks, but which was not permitted to learn in advance what subjects were to occupy its attention and deliberation. In the patent of convocation the members were called upon to meet at Itzehoe on the 15th August. The subject eventually subnitted to these Estates was the draught of a new provincial charter for Holstein, which assumed as an admitted base for further politicad constructions the very Heelslat Constitution, which forms the main point of the contest now at isue. On September 9th the Holatein Estates rejected bya majority of 46 to 2 the new charter offered, and adopted the report of the committee which had specially deliberated on it, to the following effect "The Eolstein Estates resolve that the contents of the above-mentioned report shall bh laid before the King as the respectful expression of their convictions of the grave posL tion in which the oonutry i,, and to which the declaration shall be added, that the Diet finds itself, to Its great regret unable to meet His hjesY's Inost generous desire of in' troducing an Improved charter for the separate affirs of the Duchy of Holstein, before the political position of this DuchY in the monarchy has been brought into accordance with the country's just claim to independence and equal rights." The real grievance which lies concealed behind these simple words is, that the most vital interests of Holstein, which, according to the German view of the question, is entitled, by charter and political guarantee, to manage its own affairs under the sovereignty of the Duke of Holstein (King of Denmark), have been made over to the tender mercies of a Supreme Council for the whole monarchy, in which the Danish representatives have, from the construction of the Council, infallibly a large majority of votes. As the Danish Government had during the course of the Diet shown no intention of according the claims of Holstein, which in fact require the renunciation of the HIeelsat Constitution, which is in other words the incorporation and amalgamation of the German duchies in the kingdom of Denmark, several of the representatives of Holstein in the Supreme Council announced their determination of not taking their seats in that body again until the Government showed some disposition to do Hlolstein justice. The Holstein Estates did not pass any irritating resolution to bring the matter before the German Diet; but the Estates of Lauenburg did pass such a resolution the week after; but, as the Federal Diet was not at that time sitting, it could not at once be acted upon. The two German Powers, Austria and Prussia, the mouthpieces of the German Confederation, refrained also from taking any overt act in the matter as against Denmark which could supply the latter with a welcome pretence for representing itself to Russia, France, and our Government as threatened by litigious and encroaching Germany. They confined themselve3 to a confidential oral exhortation through their representatives at Copenhagen, and the representatives of Denmark in Berlin and Vienna, in the shape of a lively hope and trust that the Dauish Government would make further steps towards fulfilling the expectations of the Rolsteiners. In the meantime the Danish Cabinet was assiduous in its representations to the other Governnents of Europe with a view to procure their countenance for any further steps it might take towards Holstein, and their acquiescence in Denmark's following the same course towards the German Duchies under the sovereignty of its King as Russia has to Poland, and Austria to Hungary. The Danish Minister at Frankfort repaired to Stuttgart, when the Emperors of France and Russia were there with their respective Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and endeavoured to produce an impression on them favourable to the Danish tacticas but in this, it appears, he signally failed, and, as it has turned out since, both Governments have given the Danish Cabinet the most urgent advice to come to reasonable terms as early as possible with its German dependency. The absence of any overture on the part of Denmark, as resulting from the rejection of its late proposed scheme for a new provincial charter for Holstein, led to the renewal of correspondence between the Austrian and Prussian Cabinets, the result of which has only been delayed by the recess of the Federal Diet and by the illness of the King of Prussia. About the middle of this month, however, the Danish Cabinet issued a circular despatch to its representatives abroad, in which it vindicates the course it has hitherto taken towards the German Duchies, and professes an immensity of kindly feeling and conciliatory intentions towards those dependencies, but at the same time affords no indication that the Danish Government is in any way disposed to relinquish the course it has entered upon. A fresh patent for convoking the Supreme Council of the whole monarchy for the 14th of Januay of next year is, however, now put forward as an evi. dence that Denmark is doing everything possible to bring matters to an arrangement, and report it made to busy herself with plans, said to be now ix embryo at Copenhagen, for putting the Holsteir amount of representation in the Supreme Co unci on a different footing towards that portion of thi monarchy. But, inasmuch as the realbone of conten tionis the Hedstal Constitution of 18e4, which involve the incorporation of the German Duchies, theG(ermw Povrer seem to think it not wrrorth while, after losinj several years m ineffectual remonstrance, to waanother three months for overtures that cannot pot sibly be satisfactory. What prevented the Germa Powers from taking the proper steps to guard a slic of their federal territory from being incorporate in 1854 was the then existing state of war an their own desire not in any way to violate thei own professions of neutrality and peace. But, noi peace is restored, every possible chance of Denmark' adopting a different line of policy is at an end; th Federal Diet is now sitting at Frankfort, there is noi a pozsibility in Berlin of gettinag diplomatic buBines sanctioned, and the certainty has been acqura that the Russian and French Governments do nc 'ntertain the meddling intentions that have bee imputed to them so freely of late by various inver tive jouirnalists.

CO.lIVCTION UNDER -THE FRAUDULENT TRUS- TEES ACT. At the quarter sessions for the borough of Leeds on Taesday last, before Mr. T. F. Ellis, the Recorder, Benjamin H2uchliffe, aged 39, clothier and commission agent, Pudsey, was charged with stealhng 19 ends of cloth, the property of James Hare, at Leeds, on the 19th of Supteiiiber. There was also a count charging the prisoner with obtaining tbe goods by fraudulent pretences. f'he indiotmient was laid under the Fraudulent Trustees Act, anr the case excited great attention, especiaUy aLiong woolen cloth muaufactn rers and merchants. The facts ot the case, as stated on the part of the prosecution by Mr. Matale, barrister- at-law, were these -In June or July, 1856, Messrs. Atkinson and Brush, cloth merchants of Leeds, entered into arrangemaents with the prisoner to receive into their warehouse any quantity of cloth which he might send to finish, and to become purohasers if the goods and price suited them, otherwise the goods to be returned to the prisoner. In the first instance they advanced him roney on account of the goods so left with them, butif they were returned the prisoner wascharged with the cost of finishing, and required to repay the money advanced, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. Several transactions took place under this arrangenient, and on the 2:0th of August last the prisoner went to the prosecutor, who was a manufacturer at Ecolesbill, aid said he had an order from Messrs. Atkinson and Brush (successors to Mesr. Henry and Co.) for 100 ends of hair lists, at 6s. 7d. per yard, which he could not supply, and asked hima (the prosecutor) if he could furnish them. HEare replied that he had a lot at the Hall, consisting of nine ends, and a further lot of 10 ends at home unfinished. The prisoner examnined the ends at the Hall and ordered them to bo sent to Messrs. Atkinson and Brush's warehouse, the price to be 6s. 7d. per yard. They were sent accordingly, and were afterwards seen in the possession of Messrs. Atkinson and Brush, Mr. Hare undeirtaking to send the remaining 10 when ready. Ozn the 5th of September he sent tour other ends, after which he saw the prisoner and told him that he had other two ends ready. The prisoner said he had not got those previously sent "pearked" (i. e., examined), and desired Mr. Hare to forward the two ends. They were accordingly sent onthe 8th, the prosecutor having at that time seen the 13 ends at Atkinson and Brush's, and on Saturday, the 19th, Mr. Hare again saw the prisoner, who said he had got the cloth " pearked," and desired that the remain inntfour ends maight be sent, so that they might also be "pearked." He had them at the Cloth-hall, and gave them up to the prisoner. He did not see the prisoner again until he was in custody, but on Tuesday he heard unfa. vourable rumours, which induced him to go to Iessrs. Atkinson and Brish's, and he then learnt that the last four ends had not been delivered there, and that as to the 15 ends, they had been taken away again by the prisoner. Tbe prosecutor would tell the jury that this was the first transaction he had with the prisoner, that he delivered the goods to the prisoner as a commission agent, and that he parted with them on the specific understanding that they were sold to Messrs. Atkinson and Brush, and that they were the parties who would be liable for the debt. The prisoner would collect the money, but would bave nothing more to do with it beyond receiving his commission. In consequence of something which subsequently transpired the prisoner was taken into custody on the 22d of September, and on the 23d the prosecutor went to Atkinson and Brush's, but cold learn nothing of the lb ends. The prosecutor then proceeded to trace his goods, and he ascertained that 15 ends had been takeu to Ar. Elenry, cloth-merchant, Boar-lane, Leeds. under the following circumstances:-He had previously delivered 14 ends ot black cloth to Mr. Henry, upon which he had received 641., but the quality was disapproved, and they were to be returned, the prisoner to repay the money advanced, or to deposit other goods to that amount, and therefore on the 10th of September he left with Mr. Henry the 15 ends he had taken from Atkiason and Brush's, the price to be bs. per yard. He was thus found dealng with goods he had received for Atkinson and Brush, at 6s. 7d. per yard, as his own property, and at 7d. per yard less than the price he was to receive for them. As to the remaining four ends which he received from the prosecutor on the 19tb of September, it i-is found that they had been sold to Messrs. Sheepshanks and York, merchants, at 5s. 9d. per yard, being lOd. below the price he was authorized to take. They would sce that the prisoner got these goods in the character of a commission agent or bailee for a specific purpose, representing in the first instance that they were for Atkinson and Brush, and that he then dealt with them as his own property, selling them to other persons than those for whom he received them, and for a price less than he was authorized to take, and, In doing so, he (Mr. Maule) should contend that the prisoner brought himself under the provisioas of the Fraudulent Trusteos Act. One section of that statute provided that any person, being a bailee of any property, who should fraudulently appropriate such property to his own use though he did not break bulk, shall be guilty of larceny. Hie should contend that the offence with which the prisoner was charged came within that section of the statute, and he should now proceed to call witnesses to prove the casoe The evidence fully bore out the statement of the learned counsel for the prosecution. Mr. BLANSUA.RD, barrister, addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner. He said, that if the Fraudulent Trustees Aot was to be applied in such cases as these there was not A commission agent ia Leeds who would escape, and maintained that the object of the section which had been quoted was to do away withthe gross anomaly which had prevously existed, under which a bailee (a person intrusted with the oustody of property) a propriatiulg property waas not amenable to the criminal law, unless he broke what was technically called " bulk." He submitted that there was no breaking bulk in this case, each transaction being distinct and open, and he therefore maintained that the offence was not one which came within the provision of this section. There was another count charging tho prisoner with the same offence, whioh would have been charged in the first count but for this Act, and he proceeded at great length to argue that the prisoner's transactions, both with Messrs. Sheopehanks and York, Messrs. Atkinson and Brush, and Mr. Henry, were open andstraightforward, and such as disprovei any suspicion of dishonesty on the part of the purchasers, or any consciousness of improper dealing on the yart of the prisoner. As a commission agent he dealt with that secrecy which was usual in the trade, declining to disclose the name of his principaL bat he always dealt as a free agent, having a right to sc-ll the goods to the best advantage. As to the goods loft with 11 essrs. Atkinson and Brush, it was clear from the evidence that, though the sample was " marked," the goods were not appropriated, and therefore the prisoner was justified in removing them (which he did openly) for the parpose of disposing of them elsewhere. If they had been appropriated the offence of removal would have been against Messrs. Atkinson and Brush, and not against Hinchlifre; and as they were not appropriated, he was justified in removiag them and offering them to Mr. Henry. The transaotion vwith EIenry seemed to hira to be a fair transaction. Beyond this, both Brush's, Mr. Henry, and other witnesses gave the prisoner a good character for honesty. It might be that the prisoner owed Hare money, but was that a reason why he shnuld be placed In the dock ? If he owed Mr. Hare a debt, let Mr. Hare recover it in another court, without seeking to brand the prisoner as a felon. The prisoner had simply sought to do his duty as a commission agent, and there was no evidence whatever that he had any fraudulent intention. The RECORDZpt thenproceeded to sum up. With reference to the law, ho was understood to tell the jury that the only point for them to decide was whether the prisoner appro. priated the property to his own ". If they wpreisotisied that he did, then the oifence would come under the section of the Fraudulent Trustees Act which had been quoted. The jury, after an hour's deliberation, returned a verdict of Guilty, and the prisoner was sentenced to be imprisoned for eight nionths, with hard labour.
THE CASE OP THE CAGLIARA STEAmlER. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Being a brother of one of the unfortunate ongineors of the Cagliari, whose name is Charles Park, I beg to thank you sincerely for alUing publio attention to this disgraceful affair in your leading article of the 27th inst. The facts are there stated with great accuracy and trutlh The account of the sufuerings of the crew is far from being exaggerated; in fact, it does not convey to the mind an adequate idea of the atrocious conduct of the Neapolitan Government. We nad a letter from my brother about three weeks ago (the second only he has been allowed to write), in which he complains bitterly of the neglect he has been treated with by his parents, he not having received one letter from them during the whole period of his imprisonment; whereas I can assure you they have written to him regularly once a-week. The letters were aU written in Italian, and nothing was said in them that could possibly be objected to by the Neapolitan authorities. This is thereforej another piece of unnecessary cruelty, and such as would not, I believe, be practised in this country against the greatest criminal. We have just heard, I am sorry to add, that the continued and increasing il-treatment which my poor brother has) been subjected to has had such an effect upon him that he has gone quite otx of his mind. You may judge of the distress this nevws has caused us; but, although every effort has been used to endeavour to obtain redress, or to awaken some interest on the part of the English Government, we have been hitherto quite unsuccessfuL Lord Clarendon has been written to twice. To the first letter he replied that he would give instructions to the Consul at Naples that the English prisoners should be properly treated. To the second no answer has yet been received. I do hope that, as yon have taken the matter up, something will be done to compel the Neapolitan Government either to release the prisoners immediately, or, failing this, to treat them with humanity, and bring them to a speedy triaL I am, Sir, yours respeotfulv.

EBNA SA4HB'S GRBEYA1CE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Several correspondents of The Times (both English and Anglo-Indian) have attempted to make out that the arch fiend, Nena Sahib has a grievance, inasmuch as he did not succeed to the annuity of his patron, the late Bajee Row Peishwa. Nena Sahlb could not under any clrcumstances have been the heir of Bajee Row Peishwa, as his adoption was never sanctioned or confirmed by the paramount Power. It may he argued that this was no fault of Nona Sahib's, bu t a culpable omission on the part of the par&nountPower, to be rnd of the pension altogether. This is a great mistake, and there is no difficulty in proving that Niena Sahlb has no claim whateyer on the Mlost people in England are aware that to be sonless iS the greatest misfortune which can befall the Hindoothe Brahmmin E partioulaz-the Brahmin Prince most ofaL It is not merely the desire of having a successor or of continuing the family name that induces this feeling, but because a father, whose son shall have the honour of lighting the funeral pyre, and of performing the annual "shraads"'* and " muntras"I will be doubly blessed in " Kylas."- Should a Brahmin be so urfortunate as to be sonless he must adopt a son, or (if he is a rioh man) sons, to perform these necessary filial offices, by which alone he can hope to enter 'Kylas' and escape the transmigrations which his religion teaches him he may have to undergoj if his "shraadse and " muntras" should not be duly performed. Bajee Row Peishwa was in this predicament, and had recourse to adoption. As a " Konkanee". Brahmin he naturally preferred that class, and I believe adopted several, amongst others Nena Sahib. Nena Sahlb is bycaste a " Bhutt, " or poet, and the son of.a poor Konkanee Brahmin. He was born at Venn (in the Nusserapore Talooka of the Northern Konkan), a miserable little village at the foot of the mountain of Matha-ran, about 30 miles east of Bombay, and close to the line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. On his adoption by the late Bajee Row Peishwa he was taken to Bithoor, where he has ever since remained. When the mutiny broke out it Is more than possible that Nena Sahib received a 1sunnud"orcommisslonfromDelhi, theseat of the once paramount power, acknowledging his adoption by the late Bajee Row Peishwa, and promising him the nnmuity, or possibly the kingdom of his patron, on condition that he became a leader of the rebel army. massacred all the English, and, as an inflaential Hindoo, seconded the pseudo King of Delhi. Although I-am acquainted with the blrthplace of Nena Sahib I cannot say whether he is a Kurrada Brahmin or not, which would in a great measure account for his unnatural ferocity, One thing is quite certain, that whatever claim, accord. ing to the Hinduo law, he may have on the private estate of the late Bajee Rovw Pelshwa, he has uot the very smallest on the supreme Government, or on the revenues of British I enclose my card, and have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant, A BONMAY V flRRT(1.

COULUT OFBA.NKRUPTCY, Basinghastree, Oct. 23. IN NR f TRTF. R(VA1. RDTflsT:- -- (Beforc Afr. Cominisioner HoLOYTn 1 This was an application under the foUowing ciroumstances :-Mr. Ramsav at the timoe of the bank's stoppage was a creditor, as a depositor, for 8001. He was, however, alleged to be liable, as a shareholder of the bank, to oalls to the amount of 5001. Under the circumstances the proof for 8001. was admitted in January last, snbjict to investigation, the object of the assignees beiDg to retain the amount as set-.ff for calls upon shares. Mr. ROXBuitRCH applied for aa order for the payment of the dividend upon the 80U.; also that a further proof be admitted for 500Z., being the amount Mr. Ramsay had paid for shares, the said shares having been issued in fraud. Mr. LINRLATER, for the assignees, opposed the applicas tion. His HosoUR saw no objection to the payment of the dividend upon the smaller sum, 3001., the differenoe between the 8001. and the 6001. claimed for calls upon shares, if the assignees concurred. With respect to the proof for the further amount of 5001. he could not with his present views entertain the application. The interest of public justice required that as little as possible should be done in the matter of the Royal British Bank until the pending prosecution of directors had been brought to a close. The public mind had become calm. It was desirable that that calm should continue, and that nothing should be entered upon that could in the remotest way interfere with the prosecution. Mr. RoxBvp cif protested against the adjournment of individual rights for the public good, but His HoNouR adhered to his decision. (Bcfore Mr. Commissioner FAREz.) IT RE DAVIS ANTD NRORMrAN. The bankrupts were oement manufacturers In Great Scotland-yard. Their debts are 2,0001. ; assets about 6601. Mr. CrDLEY, for the assiguees, did not object, and they were granted certificates of the second class, IN RE J. S. GOODERD. The bankrupt was the proprietor of the Ficcadilly Saloon. An adjournment had been ordered to give a creditor an opportunity of taking proceedings in respect to an alleged prereeential bill of sale to Seale and Co. of the Deposit Bsank in Leicester-square. MURROUGli said the opposing creditor had not taken any step in the matter, and the assignees had no objection to the bankrupt passinghis examination, Passed accordingly. IT RE CAPTAIN ROBERT JOUNSTONE, The bankrupt was adjudicated such as a dealer in fish in Billiter-street, in partnership with Mr. Pratt, but is better known for his transactions with Mr. William Kay, a young gentleman of fortune, and Samuel Adams, banker, of Ware and Hertford, also a bankrupt. Pratt had passed his examination. This was an adjourned examination meeting in tho case of Johastone. The adjournment was ordered for the pur. ose of obtaining amended answers to questions put by xr. Kay, who has been admitted as a creditor fo- 13,807L, the total amount of the banalrupt's debts exceeding 35,0001. Mr. LAivRANCE:, for the assignees, and Mr. Lucas, for the bankrupt, concurred in asking that the bankrupt might now Mr. BAGLEY, for Mr. Kay, complained that the only notice his client had had of this meeting was the circumstance of his attention having accidentally been called to the law notices in the newspapers of this morning. The Colicissio.NEa said it was impossible to proceed with the case, still less to pass the bankrupts examination under such circamstances. Adjourned accordingly, It was here stated that in Adamsus case, against whose estate a proof for upwards of 10,0001. had been admitted on the part of Mr. Kay, that at the last sitting Adams had stated that he had advanced a sum of 3,5001. to Captain Johnstone in addition to a sum of 3,3001., for which he had previously taken credit. Captain Johustone had thus been made a debtor to the estate of 6,80. Upon the statement of Adams coming to the knowledge of Mr. Glover, Johnstone's accountant, Mr. Glover, finding that Johnstone's accounts in no way mentioned this alleged advance of 3,5001., felt it his duty to communicate with Johnstone. Johnstone having ut'terly denied the receipt of the money,the case had assuaed a serious aspect against Adams. Johnstone would now be examined, and if his evidence was clear and satisfactory an application would be made for permission to apprehend Adams for felony under the 251st section of the bankrupt laws, as being guilty of feloniously concealing a portion of his estate and effects exceeding 101. Adams had first stated that the 3,5001. had been expended upon a farm. Ile had subsequently acknowledged that that statement was false, and alleged that the amount had been advanced to Johnstone. lisreason for stating in the first instance that the money had been expended upon a farm was that, having lost 13,0001. by Johnstone, he was ashamed of acknow. led ging that he had been so weak and foolish as to lend him the 3,5001. at the time the advance was made. Johnstone, examined, deposed that he kept an account at Adams's bank for the prrpose of discounting Mr. Kay's bills. The last of the transactions with Mr. Kay was in the early part of 1854. His business and friendly feeling with Mr. Ky ceased soon after that date. He had but two transactions with Adams after that, one in June or July, 1856, when Adams gave him 6301. That advance was a gft, not a loan, and was for the purpose of obtaining bis (Johnstone's) release from prison. Adams gave him the 6301. under the impression that by procuring his release he (Johnstone) would be able to see Kay, against whom he was the co-defendant in a Chancery suit. He (Johnstone) was at the time in prison, at the suits of Jackson and Co., for 7C01., Wilks and Co. for 3001., Hunt and Roskdll for 1101., and another creditor for 1001. He had been in prison nine months, and the 6301. obtained his discharge. Adams had subsequently advanced him 1401. for his ovn private purposes, but he distinctly and altogether denied that he had, directly or indirectly, advanced him any portion of thb 3,5001., as alleged. He did not receive from him 5001. in March, 1855; 1.0001. on August 2, 1855 ; 1,0001. on the 10th of Jnne, 1856; and two several sums of 5001, each at subsequent dates. He (Johnstone) was in Pnison from July, 1855, to June, 1856 ; and it was qulte impossible that Adams could have made him any advance during that period. He declared solemnly that Adams had not advanced him any part of the five sums that made up the 3,5001, ss alleged. He first heard of the allegation through Mr. Glover. He last saw Adams yesterday, when Adams called upon him. They were alone. They had had some conversation previously to that date. Adams admitted that he (Johnstone] had not had the money, and asked him to extricate him. He (Johnstone) replied that he could not assist him in any way, and he declined to do so. He first saw Adams on the subject one day last week, Adams said he had placed the sum of 3,500Z. in his balance-sheet to his name, and insinuated that he (Johnstone) should proceed to advise him how to act. He more insinuated or suggested a dishonest act than said how it should be performed. Adams admitted that he (Johnstone) had not had the money, and he asked him to assist him out of his difficulties, but didlznot suggest how it should be done, He (Johnstone) had seen Adams several times between the two meetings already mentioned. On every occasion Adams had called upon him. He (Johnstone) urged him to find the money and pay it over to his assignees. Adams said he had not the money, and that it was a mistake in his having said that he (Johnstone) had had the money, and that some one else had it-Mr. Cremour. He (Johnstone) did not know who Cremour was. He had never seen him. Saw Adams at Mr. Kennedy's, newsagent, Royal Exchange. Adanms always admitted that he (Johostone) had not had the money. The COSSIO2sroNEx granted a summons for Adams to appear to-morrow, N~To reason was given for the application not being for a warrant, e.xcept it might e inferred from a statement that Adams's whereabouts was so far known that a summons would probably be served upon him during the day. UTnder the bankruptcy laws the offence of conceal ment of property is punishable with transportation for life, reducible to seven years.
CBNTRAL CRIMINAL COURT, Oct. 29W OLD COURT. (Before Lord Chief Baron POLLOC1; anid Mr. Justice WILLEF.) The Court was oecupled during the greater part of the do n trying prisoners charged with uttering forged notes. .ze frst case taken was that of a young woman named Mary Anne Jones, aged 28, who was charged with uttering a forged 51.-note on the 28th of July. Mr. Giffard and Mr. Bayley conducted the proseoution on behalf of the Bank of England. The prisoner was defended by Mr. Lilley. The circumstances of this case were of rather an unusual character. It appeared that on the day named in the in. dictment a man named Thomas Grey, who is employed at the factory of Messrs. Maudslay, in the Westminster-road, was walking with two of his children in that neighbouirhood when he got into conversation vwith the prisoner, who represented herself to be a governess, and she made particular inquiries of him as to the manner in which he brought up his children, and whether they said their prayers regularly After they had conversed in this manner tor some time the prisoner stated that she wanted some cash, but she had nothing about her but a Si.-note, and, as she was a stranger in the neighbourhood, sbe could not get change for it, and she asked Grey to do so for her. le asLed her if it was a good note, and she said that it was; and he took it to a publnchonse where he was known and obtained change for the note in question,which was a forged one,andhandedit to the prisoner. It appeared that after this the parties aLL went to the theatre, and remaained together until 12 o'clock at night, and on the following day the note was discovered to be a forgery. Search was then made for the ?risoner, who turned out to be a prostitute, living in Oranby-street, Waterloo-road, and she was taken into custody in Webberstreet shortly afterwards. She was told the charge against her, and the answer she gave was that the note had been given to her by " a gentleman," and that she was not aware that it was forged. The LORD CEIEF BARON expressed his opinion upon these facts that, although there might be some suspicious circumstances against the prisoner, still, taking into consideration the facts that she had raade no attempt to get away after she had obtained possession of the money, and that there was nothing to show that her statement as to the manner in which she obtained the note In question was not a true one, he thought there was not sufficient to convict her. Mr. GIFFARD said he felt the force of his Lordship's observations, and he should therefore not proceed further with the case against the prisoner. The Jury therefore returned a verdict of NLot Guilty. WMiliam Sullivan, 33, and John Bolyne, 28, were charged with a similar offence. Thu same counsel conducted the prosecution; Mr. Ribton defended Sulivan. The prisoners in this case went to the shop of Mr. Cow. land, a tailor, in St. Martin's-lane, on the 13th of October, and Bolyne selected a coat and waistcoat, the value of which was lt. 16s. 6d., and they tendered in payment what appeared to be a 5o. Bank of England note. Mr. Cowland suspected the note was a bad one, and he said he must go out for change, and he proceeded to the shop of a neighbour and asked his opinion of the note, and he concurred with him that it was a forgery, The prisoners appeared to have at once taken alarm and left the shop, but Sullivan was taken into cstody while standing in a doorway a short distance from Mr. Cowland's shop, apparently watching what was going cn. The other prisoner was not taken into custody until a few days afterwards, and on his being searched a betting book was found upon him, and he was identified as having uttered two other forged notes to different parties, giving a false address upon eacb oocsion. Mr. REBTON made a very energetic appeal to the jury on behalf of Sullivan, and he contended that there was not sufficient evidence to show that he had any guilty know. ledge of the proceedings of his companion, and that, for anything that appeared to the contrary, he might have been innocently in his company when the forged note was uttered. The jury found both prisoners Guilty, and Bolyne was sentenced to 15 yeas' penal servitude, aend 13ullivan, who there was some ground for believing had not before been engaged in such transactions, was ordered to be kept in penal servitude for four years. Susan Huinby, 26, described as a vidow, was charged with a Mie offence. Mr. LiUcy defended the prisoner. In this case it appeared that a most ingenious proceeding had been resorted to in order to dispose of forged notes. The prisoner went to the shops of Mr. Toby and Mr. Lock, vwholesale shoe manufacturers in the city, and purchased a quantity of shoes and boots, which she directed to be sent to avendish-terrace, Wandsworth-road, where she represented that she was about to set up in business, and when the goods, the value of which in oech case exceeded 101., were sent home a forged note for 107. was sent back in payment. The prisoner by the same means also succeeded in passtng a foreed 51. note to Mr. Briar, a haberdasher and hosier in ng.Wilam-street and she also passed a fourth forged o1-note to the landlord of the Globo publichouse in Regent-street, Iambeth. It appeared in the course of the evidence that in both the cases where the boots and sboes were obtained a man was present at the house in Cavendish-terrace, and that he handed the forged notes to the prisoner. On the third occadon also the prisoner told the porter who brought the goods that Mr. Stevens, which was the name of the supposed purchaser of them, had given her the note to pay for them. In the ease where the note was changed at the pubhichouse it also appeared that she gave the address of her father, and she was in consequence easily discovered by the polIce. The father of tho-prisoner was very fairly put into the witness-box by Mr. Giffard, in order that the counsed for the prisoner might ask him any questions if he thought proper to do so, and in answer to Mr. Lilley he stated that at te time these occurrences took place the prisoner was engaged to be married to a man named Stevens, and that this man was lost sight of directly the prisoner was taken into custody. He also stated that the prisoner had a very slight knowledge of reading and writing. Mr. LrLEn cormenced his address to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, but when he had done so for a short time he was interrupted by The CnXF BARox, who said he thought the jury would hardly convict a person in the position of the prisoner of so serious an offence, when there were certainly some very strong grounds for coming to the conclusion thatshe was the dupe o another person. There could be no doubt that thero was a man concerned in the transaction, and he might have made use of the prisoner as a tool, and this suggestion was strengthened by the fact that when she changed the note at the publichouse she gave the correct address of her father. The jury said they concurred in the view of the case taken by his Lordship, and therefore at once returned a verdict of Not Guilt p. Henry Welsh, 37, was indicted for the manslaughter of his wife, liza Welsh. Mr. Robinson conducted the prosecution ;the prisoner was defended by Mr. Lilley. The circumstances under which this charge was preferred against the prisoner wore of a most distressing and melan. choly character. It appered that the prisoner, who was a hardworking, industnous man, lived with the deceased at Vauxhall, and they had seven children, two of whom were twns, which at the time the occurrence took place were four months old. On Saturday, the 19th of September, the prisoner gave his wife the whole of his wages, and it appeared that the deceased, who was a woman of most mtemperate habits, went out immediately and assed the evening in going from one publichouse to another, and when the prisoner caune home e found his children crying and without any food, and on his going in search of his miserable partner heat length discovered her, at 12 o'clock at night, outside a beershop in Vauxhall.walk, in a beastly state of intoxication. HIe took her home and then ascertained that she had squandered the greater part of the money he had given her, and under the Irritation that was very naturally created by suck a state of things it appeared that he struck her a blow with his open hand, and from her drunken state she fell heavily to the gronmd, and her head struck against the door, and she became insensible, and remained partly in that condition for several days, when she expired, the cause of death being extravasation of blood upon the brain, the result of violence. One of the witnesses stated the curious fact that the deceased, about a week after the occturrence, -t's iour eggs and a quarter of a pound of bacon, and dranlk seven cups of tea for her breakfast; and it appeared that during a short period of consciousnessshe called to the prisoner to come and lie by her side, and ahe inquired of him how much money she hsd brought borne on the night the affair happened; and when he told her ony 12s. and a few halfpence she exclaimed, "My God, if you bay so, I shal go mad." He then asked her where she had been during the evening, and she gave a long list of publichouses, at all of which she had partaken of Alff ent liquors-gin, rum, ale, and beer; and she also said that she had insaulted a man at one of the publichouses, but could not recollect anything more that occurred. The prisoner expressed the deepest sorrow after the occurrence, and declared that he only struck his wife with his open hand, and that he had no intention to do her any serious mischief. The unfortunate twins, it appeared, died in four days after their wretched parent. Mr. Justice WiLLxs, at the close of the evidence for the presecutlon, addressed xr. Lilley, and said it might assist amprobably if he was made aware that the point he intended to leave to the jury was whether they were satisfied that the death of the deceased arose from an act of violence committed by the prisoner, or whether, in the ab3ence of any evidence to show what took place while the deceased was wandering about in a drmuken state, it was not extremely probable that she might have received the injury which occasioned her death. Mr. LILLn,Y said he was very much obliged to his Lordship for the suggestion, and it was the only point that he should urge upon the jury. The learred counsel then proceeded to remark upon the extremely painful nature of the inquiry, and he urged that it was quite as likely that this unfortunate woman had injured herfelf by falling about while drunk and helpless as that the blow of the prisoner was the cause of her death, and he said he felt assured that in such a case, even if the jury should entertain a doubt upon the subject, they wuld give the prisoner the benefit o that doubt, and say that he was not guilty. The foreman of the Vauxhail (}as Works, where the prisoner was eraployed, was called to speak to his character, and he described him as a hard-working, well-conducted, sober man. Mr. Justice WiLLEs having briefly addressed the jury, they at once returned a verdict of .Vot Guilty. The prisoner was ordered to be immediately discharged. Mary Anne Wood, 18, was charged with feloniously setting fire to a portion of the Marylebone workhouse, persons being therein at the time, Mr. Metcalfe conducted the prosecution. The facts of this case were very short. It appeared that the prisoner was an inmate of the workhouse, and that her conduct had been very unruly upon several occasions, and she repeatedly declared that she would never do any work in the workhouse, and that she would set fire to the - place rather than work. On the day named in the indictment the prisoner and three other girls were set to work at picking oakum, and in a very short time an alarm was given that the oakum was on fire, and it was found to be in a blaze, and a portion of the flooring of the ward was burnt before the fire could be extinguished. The prisoner did not attempt to deny that it was she who had committed the offence, and after the fire had been put out she said to the people about, " I did it, and I'll do it again." It appeared that there were a number of old helpless peo le in the ward, and if the fire had spread their lives woula undoubtedly have been endangered. The prisoner, who conducted hinself in a most impudent rmanner throughout the -whole of the proceedings, when called upon for her defence said, " If they did not want the oaklm burned, why did they give it to me 2" The jury found the prisoner Gufity, upon a minor count of the indictment, of the offence of setting fire to the oalkm with intent thereby to burn the building. Mr. Tubbs, one of the grdians of theMaryleboneUnion, reqriested the Court tops as lenient a sentence as was con' sistent with the interests of justice upon the prisoaer, as he sai e hoped herconvction would operate as a warning to her aud the other evil-disposed persons in the workhouse The Cmx BAR~ON told the prisoner that the guardiansl had acted in a very kind and merciful spirit towards her, and he at the samne time informed her that if she had ben convcted of the whole offence charged in the indictment her life might have been forfeited. He did not, nowever, nelneve that she had been actnated by the diaboli cal itenotiOn of setting fire to the building, but rather that her object wa to destroy the material upon which she was required to work, to gratify her malicious feelings and evince her determination not to do any work. Under these circumstances, therefore, and taking into consideration the recommendation of the guardians, he should not prss so severe a sentence upon her as he otherwise should have done; but he still felt it to be his duly to inflict such a pun ment as would be likely to deter others from the commission ef sinmlar acts. He then sentenced her to be imprisoned and kept to hard labonr for 12 months. The grand jury having ignored the bill against Richard Clayten for a fe onious assault, he was, upon the application of Mr. Lilley, ordered to be discharged from custody. TEES QUYEENe V. EVANS] THORNE. In the report of the proceedings in this trial in 27ie l mas of Wednesdaythe cross.examlnabion of Mr. Cadogan, the prosecutor, is incorrectlymade to appear to be conducted by HIr. Serjeant Ballantine, instead of Mfr, Serjeant Parry, who was the counsel for the defendant Fvans. NEW COURT. (Before the REcoRDnnx) William Edwards, a simple-looking boy, stated In the calendar to bel6, was indicted for feloniously placing upon the North London Railway certain bricks and stones, with intent to obstruct and injure the engines and carriages using the said rzailway. Mr. Bodkin prosecuted, and Mr. Metcalfo defended. It appeared that upon the afternoon of the 19th of September the prioner was seen to descend the bank of the railway from : brickfield at Stoke Newington, in company with another boy, and put a stick upon the rail This being seean by some plate layers upon the line, they sent the prisoner back to tae It awa.y, and warned them not to come there again. The boys, however, went again and placed some stones and pieces of brick, which the engine and carriages had paswed over and broken. Mr. MarrCarvx, for the defence, said that there was ainabseRCe ot iatent upon the part of the prisoner necessary to eEtablish the offence which the indictment charged. It was a most mischievous trick, and done by the prisoner for the purpose of seeing the bricks cut in pieces. Such an act minht very properly have been punished under the bylaws of the company. The jury returned a verdict of NQot Guilty. Mr. BODK said that so many of these offenocs had been committed upon the oompany's linc that they felt bound to institute this prosecution. The RxcouDER said it was very proper. George Redpath and Joseph Orchard, two boatmen in the employment of the Great Western Railway Company, and Thomas Goodman, a marine store dealer, were indicted-the two former with having stolen a quantity of metal, value 1f, tho property of Ed ward Budd and another, and Good- win vdth having received it, knowing it to have been Mr. W. Cooper proseouted, and Mr. Ribton, zr. Sleigh, and Mr. Laxton appeared for the prsoncers. Redpath, who pleafded " Guilty," was captain of a barge called thePink, usedYfor conveyinggoods from the Thames to the Great Western Company's station at Brentford. The prosecutors are copper morchants, of Upper Thames.street and South Wales, and having been frequently robbed of old I metal during its transit between the wharf in London and the works in Wales set Gaylor and Allon, two city detectives, to watch the prisoners' movements. They marked some of the metal intrusted to Redpath, and then went down to Brentford to await the arrival of the baLrge. Upon its getting there they saw Redpath leave, and go in the direction of Goodman's honse, who keeps a marine store shop at Brentford. At a later hour in the evening the officers saw ,.ll the prisoners, Orchard being the mate, at the Six Bells, Brentford, and there Goodman made an arrangement to meet them the next morning with a cart, near where the barge ws moored. The officers accordingly went there, and took Goodman driving away with the metal inqestion The prisoners were found Guilty, acd each sentenced to 12 menths' iniprisonnent and hard labour, the learned RECoxuan stating that the Court would always deal eeverely with servants to publc companies when convicted of plun. dening their smployers. It appears that in consequence of repeated losses the company keeps a strict secret watch upon their servants, and it was only from the extremely cautious conduct of the two officers, aded by Mr. Stallard, the superintendent, that this robbery was found out. THIRD COIURT. (Before the COmmOx-fStRxAxT.) Henry Foley Hall, a fashionable-looking man, pleaded Guilty" to uttering forged checks. Mr. W. CooPE2, who appeared for the prisoner, said that he was a man of good family, but nnfortunately in verv distressed circumstances, and that hadled him into the commission of the offence, which he was now very sorry for. The sums for which the checks had been drawn were small, and the prisoner had fully intended paying them, and hin friends were now prepared to do so, and also to place the prisoner in a position that would prevent him from again offending, if the Court would take a lenient view of his conduct. Prlsoner had not been brought up to anything, his father leaving him, as he thought, independent ; bat at bis death, tthe property being thrown into Chancery,prisoner was reduced to greal want. Added to these circumstances, the prisoner was a severe sufferer from disease of the heart, and had a wife dependent upon him. The COaON-_SERJEANT sentenced the prisoner to six months imnprsonment. Nearly the whole of the day in this court was taken up in disposing of the remainder of the Mint cases, which have almost entirely ocoupied the learned Com mon-Serjeant since Tuesday morning. Only one of tho charges possessed features o sufficient interet to warrant a report, and that, from its being an entirely now method of getting rid of bad mnoney. The mode adopted was very ingenious, and its being made public may operate as a cautios should it be again attempted. The prisoner wss named WiL'aam Richardson, 42, cabinetmaker, a respectable-looking man, and stood indicted for uttering counterfeit half-sovereigns. Mr. Ellis and hlr. Lxton prosecuted; Mr. Payne deIt appw=ed from the statement of the principal witness, a lady g in Lower Grosvenor-place, Eaton-square, that she having a bill in the window for apartments to let, the Prisoner caUed and inquired about the apartments, saying tht he wanted thom for himself and wife. They were shown to him, and he made very particular inquiries, saying that his wife should clL The prosecutrix made some remark about a reference, when the prisoner said he would leave a depodL as weLl as reference if she could change him a half-sovereign. She assented, and at his request gave him 6s., retainingthe half-sovereign. About five minutes afterwards, finding the same to be bad, she went out, and in an ad,oiningstreet saw him about toknook at the door of another bouse where a biU was in the window. She went up and accused him of having passed a bad half-sovereign, which he denied, but, finding that she persisted, he said, " If it is bad, give it to me back." This she refused, upon which he pushed her aside and ran away. She instantly gave the alarm, and, a polceman coming up, took him into otstody. When within a short distance of the constable prisoner was seen to throw either a sovereign or a half-sovereign over the railings into Chester-square. * Mr. PAYNE, for the prisoner, contended that the uttering of a single half-sovereign was not sufficient as evidence of a guilty knowledge. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment and hard labour. The Mint counsel said this was the first case of the kind they had heard of.
POLICE. * GUILDTHiZ-Francis Allen, a nowsvendor, of 15, Bathstreet, who was remanded on a charge of stealing a reamn of Loidon JournaZs from the premises of Mr. Clark, of War. 'ick-lane, was brought up before Alderman HPHiEpRY for further examination. * On the previous examination it appeared the prisoner and two men were seen in company proceeding towards Mr. Clark's shop. One remained outside while the prisoner and the other went in, and while Mr. Clark was looking at the back of the shop for the papers they had asked for he beard some reams of paper fall from the counter, and when the men left he discovered that one ream had been abstracted, whieh WAS afterwards found at the prisoner's oafice, in Bath-street, Newgate-street. Mr. Lewis now appeared for the prisoner. Alfred Palfer, who was called on the last examination by the prisoner to prove that the ream of London Jourinals was left at the office, 15, Bath-street, Newgate-street, in the prisoner's absence was now recalled, and said,-I was standing outside the office door on Saturday evening last, about a quarter past 7 o'clock. The door was locked, and I could not get in. The prisoner came In a few minutes after the bundle had boeen left, and said to me, " Ras the bundle been left ?" I told him it had, and he then took it up and carried it into the office, and put it by the sofa. I should kow the man who left the parcel with me. My master (the prisoner) did not tell me who he was. Cross-examined.-EIe did not say, "Eas the boy brought the bundle of papers for sending off by post ?" He did not say anything about the st. No other bundle vas brought but the one produced. 1Pdid not say anything to the prisoner before he asked If the bundle had been left, Mr. Clark, cross-examined.-I saw the bundle safe in the shop about three minutes before the prisoner and the other man camne in. Neither of them took the bundle when theyleft. I have k-nown the prisoner many years, and never heard anything to hig prejudice before, and if he had wanted the papers on credit I should have had no hesitation in trusting him. I saw him pass my shop Bhortly after he had left. Mr. Martin (chief clerk).-Is this the whole of the evidence in this charge ? Mobbs 265.-It is, Sir; but there are other charges against him, as I have found 58 duplicates in the prisoner's iron safe referring to gold watches, rings, and a variety of other jewelry. I found this timepiece and glass shade, and this bronze statuette at the address he gave me at Totten- Mr. Lewis said, the prisoner had given an acecount of every. thing to the officer. Prlsoner.-There are only two gold watches and two gold ohains among those duplcates, and I have told the officer where I bought them; the rest refer to wearing appareL Mobbs.-There is another constable engaged in the case, but he is in attendance at the Old Bailey, and has possession of all those duplicates. Alderman HusrH.sRY.-Then I shall remand the case for inquiry into all those pledges. Mr. Lewis.-Wim you take bail, Sir, for the prisoner? Aldermarin ElUPm ERtY.-Certainly not. Mr. Lewis.-Will you let the prisoner have the money founad upon him? Alderman HuipiuuRY.-How much is it? Mobbs.-About 17s., Sir ? Mr. Clark.-I have seen the wife of the prisoner, Sir, end she and her children are thrown into the greatest distress, and were yesterdsy obliged to sell their bed from under them, and they have now no place to lie upon. I have known both the prisoner and his wife for many years as highly respectable persons, and if you will let the wife have this money I will add 5s. to the amount from my owfn pocket. Alderman HIImEiEnRY then ordered 15s. 'o be given to the wife, which, with Mr. Clark's contribution, made up the amount to 11., and remanded the prisoner till Tuesday noxt. Bow-sMErr.-A sturdy, powerful young feUow named Patrick Neal, and a lad named Johu Smith, both denizens of Charles-street, Drury-lane, and both known to the police, were cbarged with disorderly conduct and assaults. It appeared that one Hassan, a Lascar, and Raz Huab, a Nubian, who both live in Charles-street, were regaling themselves with pudding in a provision shop there at about mldnight on Wednesday, wuen the prisoners entered, and Neal bought some pickled cabbage, -which, without any provocation, he threw in the face of Hassan. The latter said, " Don't do that;" and Neal replied, " I will," and struck him. A scuffle ensued, in which Smith joined, and between them Hassan was being overpowered, when Policeman Rad. stock, F 118, came to his aid. Smnith cried " On to the Slops," which it appears ts a slg name for the police. Th,y then attacked Radstock, but, several other constables eomng to his aid, they w.ere soon overpowered and removed to the station. The prisoners asserted that they were first attacked, and insisted on sending for the shopkeeper, who, however, confirmed 'he story og Hassan. An attempt was made to examin Raz Hach, who, though he apparently understood all thart passed, spoke so hideous a jargon that it was Impossible to understand a word, beyond his declaration that he was a believer in Allah, and would consider himself bound by the oath.

He (Hawan) replied that aa they were in custody he had no more to do with the matter. Ele appealed to the constable for protection, and then got away as last as he could, for he wanted to get to bed.

MnALnBOROU0GSTRXY..r.-William Atkins was brought before Mr. BiNoxesAs, charged with stealing a large quantity of property from various dwellinghouses. A man named Fildes was apprehended on Tuesday and charged with having entered No 15, King-street, and stolen therefrom about 25t. worth of miscellaneous property belonging to George Rich. The aocused was remanded on the testimony of a female witness, who stated that the prisoner resembled a man who went downstairs with a large bundle. On Wednesday the prisoner Atkins was taken into custody on another charge of entering a house in Berwick-street, and stealing from it property valued at upwards of lOOL. The witness, who bad given evidence against Fildes, having accidentally seen Atkins, at once declared that he was the iuau who had committed the robbery in King-street, and that she was mistaken with respect to Fildes. ThLs witness having shortly afterwards pi=ed out Atkins from among a number of strangers, and repeated her aertion that he was the man she had seen, and not Fildes, Mr. BiNGor immediately sent to the prison and had Fildes brought up for the purpose of being discharged. The prisoner Atkins was then charged with having been foudin a dwellinghouse, 26, Greek-street, for a felonious Isrs Marshall said, yesterday she found the prisoner in a back room in her house. The prisoner said he came there thinking a person named Kelly lived in the house. She told hiim he was nothing but a thief, and gave him Into custody. The second casa, was for stealing a large quantity of property from 45, Berwlok-stroet, the property of Elizabeth Burke. The prisoner was ideatified by two witnessesnamed James Elliott and Ellzabeth Pepper. As the police expected to get further evidence and to bring forward other cases, the prisoner was remanded till Friday next. SOUTHTAwI.-l-Philip Doyle, a young fellow about 20 years of age, was brought before Mr. CO03BY, charged with defrauding S3ergeant Anthony Choyne, of the 3d Royal Surrey Militia, of ls., and absconding after enlisting in the 23d Foot. The sergeant stated that he was instructed by the Waroffice to enlist recrits for the line, and in the middle of last month the prisoner came to him and wished to enlist in the 23d Foot. Witness asked him whether he had been in the army before, when he replied that he had not. He also answered the usual questions about being free, able, sad willing to serve Her Majesty, when witness handed him the enlisting shiling. He then took his address, and told him he would be required to be in attendance before the doctor on the following day. He, however, did not appear, and witness left a notice at the address he had given, but he saw no more of him until Saturday, wl:en he met him in the Borough and gave him into custody. The p.-soner denied being the man alluded to, and had norecolection of ever seeing the Lergeant before. Hle never had his shilling. Sergeant Choyne informed his worship that he was podtive as to the prisoner's identity. Latterly about 20 young fellows had absconded after receiving the enlisting shilling which was a fraud on him, and the War-office authorities were determined to punish all persons so offending as a caution to othei. Many young fellows had actually enlisted a dozen times over, and he believed the prisoner had twice. Mr. ComBE asked him whether he could positively swear to the prisoner as being the man who received the shilling from biri? The sergeant replied that he could. He pointed him out immediately to the policeman when he met him. Mr. CoamB, after perusing the Act of Parliament, said, he was of opinion that the prisoner must be deemed a deserter; therefore he should commit him to the County Gaol to be dealt with by the authorities at the War-office. His worship directed the usual deserter's description to be made outt and forwarded to the latter place. The prisoner, who still persisted that he was not a recruit, Was then committed to prison.

TURNPIKE TOLLS. TO THE, EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I am glad to find that The Times has taken up the subject of turnpike tolls. I have read your admirable article with much interest, and shaU be glad to be permitted to contribute a few remarks upon the subject. It is asserted by Mr. Hamilton Nisbet and other supporters of the turnpike system that its opponents seek to impose a new burden on the landed interest. But such is not the case. 13y the common law of England, " the charge of repairing all highways lies upon the occupiers of the lands and buildings in the parfsh wherein they are, who are bound to maintain the same in good repair for the free passage of all the Queen's subjects." (See Burn's Justie, title, " Highways.") Such is the ordinary common law liability. The turnpike system ie an innovation upon and :xception to the general law, and consists In enclosing and shutting up a portion of the Queen's free highway until a tax has been paid for the use of it. Thibsystem, no doubt, had its origin in the circumstance of improvements being required in greatthoroughfares between populous towns such as the parishes were not bound to make, and in the extraordinary wear and tear caused by the great through traffic between large towns. Tho parishes were not bound to widen roads or to lower hils and fill up valleys, and make like improvements. Hence the turnpike system, and hence its uie in its day. But the system so introduced was no doubt improperly extended in many cases, and many roads were made turnpike which were not great thoroughfares, and did not require any extraordinary improvement, and never ought to have been other than ordinary highways. But this innovation upon the ordinary law of highways was confined to the rural districts. The inhabitants of towns have never been allowed to tax the public for their improvements. Great outlay has been made by the townspeople in the widening, lovelling, paving, lighting, cleansing, waterIog, ant otherwise improving of their sticets; but the cost, whether under the ordinary law or under Acts of Parliament, has always been defrayed by the old English system of rates upon the inhabitants themselves, and they havc not been allowed to tax the public by tolls for the purpose. A further instance of the exceptional character of the turnpike system is to he sees in the fact that turnpike Acts were never granted by the LegIslaturo for a longer period than 21 years. At the end of that time it was optional with the Legislature to renow the Act or to allow the road to return to its original character of a highway; and they are now renewed from year to year by an annual Continuance Act. Again, if the tolls prove insufficient for the repair of a ti-rnpike road, the parish is still liable to contribute to its repair as a highway. " It is a mistake to suppoJte (says Lord Wensleydale, in giving judgmuent, in 4, Barn. :.nd AdoL, 109) that the object of turnpike Acts is to relieve parishes and townships from the burden of repairing the highways. Their object is to improve the roads for the general benefit of the public, by imposing a pecu- iary tax in addition to the means already provided by law for that purpose." These circumstances show the exceptional and temporary character of the turnpike system. No doubt the Legislature is moraBy bound to provide fcr the payment of the debts which have been contracted under the authority and popn the faith of turnpike Acts, and of which the public has had the benefit in great national im. provements; but it is not bound to continue the system as a system of repairs longer than the general benefit of the com. munity may require. No new liability would be imposed upon the landowners or their tenants by abolishing the turnpike system; it would only be necessary for the Legislature to cease to renew the turnpike Acts, and without any new enactment the roads would fall back to their original condition of highwayE, to be repaired by the parishes or townships. And they would fall back to the parishes in a greatly improved condition to that in which they were taken from them. There are two reasons which more particularly direct our attention to the turnpike system at the present 'Ume, and call for an inquiry into the justice of its continuance,-the iI ret, that the railway system, which may now be considered as in the main comupleted throughout England, has deprived the turnpike roads of all the great through traffic, which was the only adequate recon for the establishment of the turnpike system; the second, that the heavy expenditure w-hich has fallen upon townc of late for sanitary and other iniprovements has rendered more burdensome the grievance of their being compelled to contribute to the relief of the liabilities of other people. It appears fro,m the last report of the lIume Secretary on turnpike trusts (February 24, 1l57) that the turnpike toll3 throughout England and North Wales amuounted in the vear 18:7 to 1,510,0001., but in 1S54 to 1,060l,OO1. only, skowing a diminution of labmt one-third. This dirninution has, no 4doubt,be-n caused eutizoly by tle loss ,,f -Vi through traffic, the stage coach and posting and stage waggon trafic, for the local traaic must Ln geniera6 have increased with the incresse of population and wealth. It further appears from a Parliamentary return (July 22, 1S57) that the ordinary highway rates in the counties of Ergland and Wales in the year ending Lady-day, 1853, amounted to 1,035,0004, and that the highway (or street) rates iil tLe cities boroughs, and towns in England and Wales aumouinted in the same year to 1,07',,0001. It is a curious coincidence that the turapike tolls, the highway rates, end the street rates throughout| England should each amount to about a million per annum. .What is the annual value of the property which contributes ao higbvpy rates, and what that of the property which i contributes the street rates the rAturns do not inform us. t ut I apprehend there can be l]ttle doubt that the formoc greatly exce0ds the latter. 1i turnpike tolls were abolished the roads repaired, by those tons would, as a general rule (with, sf eonurse, particular exceptions), fall upon the pro. perty now paving highway rates (as opposed to street rates), or the rurei property, and cause an addition to those rates. Their abciition would therefore, as a general stAtement, be an snmixed relief to the inhabitants of towns I ,aho pray street rates. But I think that it must be evidest that it would be notbing more than a relief from a positive injustice. Every town in England is now st"rounded by turnpike-gates, 'which tax all the townspeople riding or driving out of the town, and this tax is expended otaide the gates, and not within them. The townsmuan gets no bonefit from the tax; he has in addition to support his streets by parish or borough rates. It is true that the gates eqjually tax the rural inhabitasts who come iato the towns, but with this difference, that the tax, or a large portion of it, is employed in relief of liabilities which by law would otherwise fall upon themselves. They ride and drive about the towns without paying amything for that accommodation. The abolition of the turmpiCe-tax, therefore, being a clear aolief to the town population, let us inquire how it would affect the rural. I have stated the present amount of tolls in England to be at -,ut a million per annum. Now, there can he no doubt that that millfon is collected at a cost of at least 25 per cent. So that a million and a quarter are taken at the gates. I will not go into a calculation to establish this statement, but a little inquiry will convince any one of its truth, while 2A per cent. would as a general rule provide for the collection of a rate. Now, of that million arising from tolls about GO0,0001. a-year (giving round sums) are expended in repairs, 100,0001. in salaries to officers and law expenses, and 300,0001. in payments to creditors of the trusts. It follows that of the sunis collected at the gates about one-half only is expended in the repairs of the roads. Now, considering the almost universal absorption by the railways of the great through traffic between towns, can there be much reason to doubt that onie-half of the sums taken at turnpikes is contributed by the rural inhabitants, upon whom the repairs of those turnpike roads would fall if the turnpikes were abolished ? If so, the rural inhabitants, taken as a body, are not gainers in a pecuniary point of view by the turnpike system, and they, in common with the inhabitants of towns, might rejoice at its abolition. Tho foregoing figures also show that the addition to the hihway rates by the abolition of turnpike tolls would be about three-fifths of the present amount of the highway rates. Assuming the highway rates now to average 5d. in the pound (which I think is about the mark), the addition would be 3d. in the pound. I apprehend that the inhabitants of towns would in general be very glad to escape with street-rates of 'd. in the pound. It remains only to consider the subject of the debts of the turnpike trusts, which, in fact, form the main obstacle to the abolition of the system. The debts at the end of the year 1856 (the last return) amounted to 5,5C0,000l., and the arrears of interest to 840,0001. The arrears of interest are hopeless debts, and would be gladly given up by the creditors to obtain the principal. The principal may be consideted at the present time as reduced, by sinking funds, to 5,000,0001. The sale of the toll-houses and gates would produce 1,000,0001., leaving a debt of 4,000,0001. to be provided for. The only fair mode of providing for it appears to be to charge it on the national revenues. If the nation abolishes the turnpike-tolls on which the debts are charged it must take the debts on itself. The debts now generally bear interest at 51 per cent., but, charged on the national revenues, 31. per cent. would be adequate interest, and would render the securities quite as marketable as they are at present. Exchequer bonds at 31. per cent. may therefore fairly be substituted for the present turnpike bonds. An annual sutm of 200,0001. would pay the interest of the 4,000.0001, at 31. per cent, and pay off the principal in 30) years. Would England grudge an annual payment of 200,0001. to get rid of the nuisance of turnpikes ? A tax of less than a penny per pound upon tea would provide it, but, of course, a fairer mode would be a small additional tax upon horses and carriages throughout England. The debts being thus provided for by the Legisature, nothing would remain but to repeal the turnpike Acts, or, in fact, to cease to pass tho annual renewal Act, and thus leave the turn- plice roads to revert to their original condition of highways. If the highway system requires amendment, that is a separate question. But I trust that no departure will ever be made from the present system of parochial liability and rating. All that is required is an efficient system of supervslon, to have competent officers appointed, eitheo by the Government or by the county magistrates, to inspecthe roads, and to compel the several parishes properly to discharge those obligations which the law casts upon them. Your constant reader. IV. flemple, (ct. 28. P.S.-Your corresponeent of Dublin, in your paper of the 27th inst., is not quite correot in saying that at this moment there is not a single tmnpike in Ireland. The Ac' for the abolition of turnpikes in Ireland, passed last se;sion (20 and 21 Vict., c. 16), comes into force on the oth of Aprzil next, at which time turnpikes will wholly cease in Ireland.
" 2HOSE WHO USE ROADS SHOULD PAY FOR THEM." TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-East Lothian is much obliged by your able and truthful article on "Toll Reform," in your journal of the 23d inst. It has attracted much notice in this county, and from your evident knowledge of the locality it may interest you to know that although the above is the rich Laird of Dirleton's motto his practice is very different. From Dirleton toll being "favourably situated" on the outside of Archerfield policy, he can travel eastwards and through N orth Berwick three miles, and westward about six milestogether about nine miles-without contributing one far. thing to the maiatenance of the road. There are other trustees as " favourably situated " in regard to tolls in the county of Haddington. I enclose my card, bat beg to sub. scribe myselt A.N EAST LOTHIAN MAN. October 28.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,--As an instanCe of the vigour and decision of the authorities at Calcutta allow me to state a fact which I have not seen noticed in your columns. The second battalion of the Military Train, under Captain Robertson, a very good officer-as those who recollect his exertions in the Crimea can testify-was, you may re. member, sent out with the Chinese expedition as a portion of the forcer to be etmployed in guarding and conducting the stores, baggage, and transport of the army. The battalion was luckldy intercepted, and on its landing at Calcutta it was imrrediately turned into light cavalry, and was marchAd iff at once to join General Havelock's column. I have uot the least doubt but that they will do excellenb service. The battalon nmustered 250 horsemen, and would make a very strong squadron, or, indeed, a regiment, as rrgiments took the field in the last wer. The men are young, active, and well drilied, tbe!z average height 5ft. Gin., and, as they were well armed and equipped, tLere would be no expense in turning them into cavalry. If this mutiny continues why should not the authorities send out some of the battalions of the Military Train now inactive at Slorncliffe and elsewhere, to be employed as cavalry in the East ? Their services would be invaluablo i: ^oc'uring the country, in broAking up parties of mutineers or bands of dacoits, who -will hover around us long after the masses of the enemy have been shivered into pieces. Our present force is lamentably deficient in cavalry-an arm without which the successes of infantry and artillery in the field are robbed of half their fruits-and it is not advisable to rely so much as we do on the various Irregular regiments, consisting of natives, who may at any monment yield to the frenzy which has convulsed India. I am certain that the ofrficers and men of the Military Train, though understood to be non-combatant, except in case of attack by the enemy, would to a man rejoice at the opportunity of active service in the field. M3any of those officers were trained to wield their swords in the Crimea, and are of high military reputation; and the men, who have been most assiduously drilled for many months, and havo been brought into excellent discipline by the care of Colonel M'Murdo, and his offlcers, Colonel Evans, Major Shervinton, Colonel Heyland, and others, are fit for immediate service in the face of an enemy. Your obedient servant, W. H. R.
ThE SOUTIAsPTON TowN COUNCIL AND TEE POLICE ACT.-Some months since Mr. Edward Wills, one of the Government Inspectors of Constab;larv, paid a vinit of insnection to the police force of Southampton, and in lhis subsequent report he recommended that two sergeants and 14 constables should be added to that force. A copy of the Inspector's report was forvarded to the proper authoritier at Southampton, and at a meeting of the town counoil on Wednesday it was submitted to that body for their conslderV,ion. After come discumion a reslcution was unanimousLy agreed to,- "Thatt.rse reconm,endation ef 'hre G-peneut ItDftot ot Police, to iucreae the number of the forcu of this b brough be not sdopted, Ibis osuncil L.elieying themseelTes better qusjj5,,j to iwise in OA,S reIpect of the xequaremeLts ot the b roueh than & Q'sernmeut lnas oetor." 'The corporatio:r and public of Southampton have invariably opposed the ink rference of Government on this question, and were among the most determined opponents of the Police Bill of Li3, ns well as of the one which was intro. duced a few years pxwin6usly, anld was then successfally resistedR by the UtuDicipa' autireies of the kingdom.
THE EA2IA OF HARROWBY ON THE INVIA47 ilfUTINY. At tle *annual dinrer of the Sandon and Marston Agrionltumal Sr,oiety at Saudon, on Wednesday, The Righb Hon. tho Earl of HARtROW}sY in proposing th e health of the Army and Navy" spoke as follows :- I cannot mention the army without reverting to w;hat our soldiers have been and are undergoing in India. I cannot mention the narue of the army without thinking of tbat distant land where our brave soldiers are undergoing all the horrors of war aggravated by an unhealthy climate and the treachery-I do not know -whether to say ihe treachery of friends or enemies. The accounts of this mutiny have rominded me of the expression oE the Psalmist, "If it had been mine enemy that had done this I could have borne it." If the calamity had come upon us from some fortign foe it would have been bad enough ; but coming from our own subjects, our old familiar friends, it is doubly hard to bear. Gentlemen, you know what difriculties our army has had to encounter. 2lot only have ouir countrymen had to meet danger upon the open field, where man meetsiman in honourable fight, regulated by the common principles of wvarfare; but it has met them in their own tents, around their own mess-tables, among their own people, who had in many cases deceived them by assurances of friendship and fidelity. They were unprepared to meet the danger; they were scattered up and down the country in hundreds and in fifties, they were surprised, and had no time to organize a plan of defence; they have met an enemy at every step, and have found foes where they expected to find friends. Well, gentlemen, how have our countrymen behaved under these circumstances? Their conduct has rendered them objects of affection and esteem to their countrymen, and has elicited admiration and applaute even from the most jealous of our neighbours. It used to be said in Pagan times that the noblest sight the gods enjoyed was to see a good man struggling with adversity. Gentlemen, I am quite sure that the history of the world has furnished no nobler spectacle for the admiration of either gods or men than that exhibited by our countrymen in India. Taken by surprise, attacked by overwhelming numbers, and without provisions or adequate means of defence, they have yet manfully held their own, waiting for succour to arrive. That succour, gentlemen, I hope is nigh, and the worst is pest. Our few troops were at a distance of half the world from succour; they were taken at tho most unhealthy ssason of the year; they were totally unprepared for the danger. We had guarded against outward foes, but not against treachery within, and when the native troops proved unfaithfal we were almost without European troops to faU back upon. But, even under difficulties like these, our men have been able to hold their own. (Cheers.) But for the news of the last two days we could not have said more thAn this; but now we may say that not only have they been able to hold their own, but they have reconquered the ancient capital of India. (Loud cheers.) Gentlemen, I think our anxieties now with regard to India may be said to be almost at an end. A continuous stream of British troops has for some time been landing upon the shores of India, and I am quite sure the next maaU will bring us news of troops pouring in from all the differen'. presidencies, from Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, and up the Indus, sufficient to reestablish everywhere the supremacy of Britain. The ques. tion of the future government of India is of vast importance: but before I pass to it let me call your attention to the state in which this mutinv found us. Let us not forget, in the feelings which naturally arise at the successful ter. mination of the struggle, our own shortcomings, Very recently, when the war with Russia broke out and we were brought into contest with the most powerful military nation in Europe, we were taken unprepared. We then swore by ad the gods that we never would be taken in that way again. But as soon as the war was over what was the course we pursued? "Get rid of he income-tax; cut down the army, cut down the navy," was the cry; and, in compliance with that demand, the Government did reduce the army and navy, until, when this inutiny broke out, we were entirely unprepared for it, and had hardly a soldier in the country. Enough of this, gentlemen, let us not do so again ; let us in future not only beprepared to make sacrifices in the face of danger, but when the danger is past. We have a great empire, and with a great empire we have great responsibilities. Our empire extends to every qu3rter of the globe, and has dealings with all sorts of people; it brings us into contact with races of all re. ligions and every form of govern ment, and it is impossible that difficulties should not often arise. We must be prepared for this responsibility; we must not be taken unprepared-we must not again be found in a condition that renders us lable to the loss of a great and important dependency; we must have an army ready for any emergency that may arise. (Great cheering.) Gentlemen, I hope that these lessons from the Crimea and from India will not be thrown away upon us, and that we shall not be found unprepared in future. It is difficult to separate the question of the present mutiny from the consideration of the future government of India. It is, of course, impossible at this moment to fix the precise limits of the struggle, but there is no doubt our rule will be reestablished over that country, and then will come the important duty of reorganirng our government over 130,000,000 of people. When we find that difficulties arise at home -that among a population of 30,000,000, of thesame habits, religion, andform of govermment, accustomed to eachother's prejudices-when we find the task of government is difficult here, what must it be to govern 130,000,000 of people on the other side of the globe, with habits, opinions, customs, and religions differing from each other, and all differing frem our own, especially when we consider that that government must be carried on by Europeans by means of the people whom they have to govern? How would you hlke to undertake the difficulty of managing that immense empire? The government of India is a problem of which the history of the world furnishes no solution; and I mention these eircumstances for the purpose of asking your indulgence for those upon whom the task of reconstituting -- b--- -u .> wou-usy may las. 1r nas been a subject of reproach to us that more has not been done for India In the way of improvement. No doubt more might have been done; but on the other hand you must bear in mind the difficulty arising from the danger of offending the prejudices and outraging the feelings of the natives, while we were obliged to govern by the aid of the natives themselves. If we had a sufficient number of European troops to govern the country the case would be different, but that is manifestly impossible. The finances of the Indian Government would be ruined by the attempt to govern that immense empire by the aid of English troops alone. We mnust, therefore, govern it through the people themselvesthrough their own feelings and prejudices, or give up the attempt to govern it at all. I do not say that there is not much that may be dared now that could not have been dared before this outbreak occurred. There is much that a Dlan will not do when he fears the attempt will bring his house down about his ears that when the house is brought about his ears he will set about with alacritv, and, no doubt, in reference to India that may be done now in the way of education and in disregard of mere idle prejudices which could not be done while we had in the Bengal Presldency a native army of 100,000 meD, which, though in one sense, the strength of the Government was also a source of weakness. The noble lord, after a few other observations, directed attention to the beneficial change effected in the moral character of our soldiers dauing the past few years, and concluded by proposing the toast, which was enthusiastically received.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-PermitT me to disabuse" Indophilus "of his idea thab the Australian colonies will, under any condition, con. sent to receive Indian iatineers under sentence of transportation. Any such proposal on the part of the Home Government would be fatal to the good feeling which exists in Aus. tralia towards the mother country, and would, I fear, give an unanswerable argament to the minority, who are now ahlost hopelessly advocating separation. The Australian colonies pay the entire expense of their civil, and some of them of their military Government. They are ready to contribate their fair proportion to imperial necessities, and in the last war they subscribed to the Patriotic Fand more than Scotland or Ireland or all the other British possemsions put together. But they wiU not have convicts ; and I think that this determination coming from the producers of 13 millions of gold per annum had better be respected. If " Indophilus" wiU pardon me, I venture to suggest that he should pause before giving the weight of his official posi. tion and character to proposals of so sweeping a nature. I am. &c.. COLONUS.

BANQUEIT o Me MEMBERS fot' PON)TEFRac. On We;mInesday last Mr. R. M. Milnes and Mr. Wood, the members for the borough of Pontefract, were enter. tained by their constituents at a public dinner in the Townhall. TheMayor (Mr. Wright) presided, nd was supported by the two members; Lord Gelway, MP. for East Retford; 1 Mr. Pickering, the Recorder for Pontefract; Mr. Dunn. the Mayor of Doncaster; the Rev. R. Stainfortb, the Rector of Pontefract, &c. Altogether about 1.50 of the most respectable inhabitants of the town and district were present. The uual loyal and national toasts we then drunk, after which The MAYOR gave "The Borough Members." He wa s glad, he said, that they had reached that point when they i had not to send deputations to London or elsewhere to find | their members, but could find gentlemen worthy of the honour among themselves. (Hear, hear.) Their members were entitled to their gratitude for the sacrifioes they had made, and he hoped that some such demonstration as that i would tako place annually, so that they could show their I gratitude, and do away with anything like political I animosity. (Hear, hear.) One of their members had j served them 20years, and he hoped he might live to serve i them for twice 20 years more. (Laughter.) The other 1 had not long represented them, but he had no doubt he weuld do all he could for the banefit of his native town and of the country generally. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MmLNES, on rislng to respond, was received with great enthusiasm. After thanking his constituents for the honour they had done him, he briefly alluded to the Divorce BiU and Probate and Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill, and then remarked that during the past session of Parliament there had been constant allusions to the question of Parliamentary Reform. It was said by Her Majesty's Government, and perhaps not without reason, that the moment the new Parliament had come together was not the time to proceed with a measure for separating it, and they therefore deferred the subject until next session, when he had no doubt a measure would be brought forward. So far as he knew, it was not the intention of Her Majesty's Government to propose any great organic change upon the Reform Bill of 1832. He believed it was not the wish of the House of Commons that they should do so, but tt was the wish oE all reasonable men in the Hlouse as well as in the country that they should ascertain from the experience of the past 20 years in what points the Reform Bill had failed, and to add to the respectable constituency of the country by remedying the defects thus ascertained. (Hiear, hear.) This could be done without anything like popular agitation, and he trusted that they would all bend their minds to It with sobriety and good sense, and with as little hostility as possible. (Hear, hear.) They would remember that in the Bill laid upon the table of the House by Lord John Russell Pontefract not only retaiaed its two members, butbecame the capital of a division of the county. (Rear.) If there was a different provision in the new Reform Bill, he could only say he should not consent to it. (Hear.) The hon. member then proceeded to refer to the petitions last year presented against the return of himself and Afr. Wood, and observed that, believing the petition against Mr. Wood to have arisen from personal rnotives, and to be directed more against the borough of Pontefract than against Mr. Wood, he placed himself in the witness-box of the Parliraentary committee to vindicate the honour of the borough, and to prove that during the 20 years he had had the honour of representing it he had not paid one shilng corruptly, and thst he had never done more in the way of donations than had been according to ancient custom. From the long prevalence of this custom the people had come to look upon It as a right, and when he had argued 'with them on the subject some of them had replied, " Now, we are sure you would never take our rights from us." (Laughter.) Now, ho was glad this was done away with fr le was sure that if they once connected a vote with n oney it would be very difficult to see where it would lead to; it was touching a wrong chord-it was suggesting a wrong idea; and the voter would be led to suppose that he was to deal with his vote as a personal matter, and not as a citizen of his cotmtry; and that feeling having once become imnpressed upon the voter, it would be impossible to stop more dangerous consequences. (Rear.) lRe trusted that those constituents to whom he had alluded would be embraced in the improvement of political education In this country, and thatthey wouldlreceivethe sameadvantages as the rest of their fellowdcitizens. (Hear, bear.) In improving their eleotoral system they were really not only performing an act of political consistency, but also an act of nioral duty. (Hear.) But all who were desirous of extending the right of voting largely in this country, and of bringing 'within its range considerable masses of their fellow-subjects, 'w ould see that it would be of no use; that there would be ro meaning in It unlems these men were to exercise their vote freely and independently, unless they were to exercise it, not from any sordid motives but as English citizens for the good of their country. (Hear, hear.) He could not sit down, he continued without saying something on general public subjects, though it was extremely painful to do so, because there was one all-absorbing subject upon which they had all of them thought-the present state of Tndia. (Hear, bear.) Theythad received the toast of "the Army and Navy' with that enthusiasm wvhich Englishmen always manifested when it was proposed, and he must say that be had often laughed when foreigners told him that England was not a military nation, and wished he could show tbem how such a toast was received in their public assemblies. (Hear, hear.) It was permitted to themn on such festive occasions as those to forget the difficulties and miseries of war, and to remember only its glories-the raagnificent spirit of endurance evoked to the utmost-the nobleness of men dying for their country. It was permitted them to do this in a common war, but the conflict in which they were now engaged was very differert from the wars of which they h ordinarily to speak because they must remember that that which under other circumstances would have been an unparalleled triumph-a mere handful of Englishmen having stormed the great city in which the last descendants of the great emperors of the East, represented by the family of Timour, were making their last stand-surrounded with enormous numbers armed with an immense amount of artillery-surrounded, indeed, by such a power as those descendants could never have coUected together, but with which the negligence of the authorities in India supplied them,-that evens would, as he had said, under any other circumstances have been an unparalleled triumpb, but that the army with which they had been and were fighting was one not worthy of their skiUl. (Hear, hear.) Englishmen had always a desire to respect the enemy who attacked them, and if it hung only upon the fact of the unworthiness of their present foe it would be bardly possible for them to feel sufficient exultation. If it had been the princes of India who had risen under the pretence that the English had despoiled them of their ancestral rights; if it had been the peasantry who had risen, because, comparatively unaccustomed to the English rule, they had felt that the taxation was oppressive, and had been unable to comprehend the justice of their administration, then there would have been something to say in their behalf. Bat what was there to say now? Here were men, armed and disciplined by them, for whose comfort they had cared, for whose interest they concerned themselves, whose prejudices they had regarded, whosefeelings thev had respected to a degree unheard of before in any dcvlized nation ; and yet these were the very men who had risen against them, not in fair fight (for in fair fight they bad never met the English troops), but by brutal treachery and by every means of dishonour. (Hear.} And therefore, because this foe was hardly worthy of their skill, they could not enjoy that victory as they ought to do. (Hear.) He would lead them away, however, from the contemplatian of that victory to the simple but enduring triumph of noble Englishmen and Englishwomen, who had suffered unheard of-cruelties during this terrible struggle. (Applause.) He would tell them to read such letters as those written by Mrs. Ewart-written w.th all the composure of a Christian philosopher when the destiny of herself and family hung in the scale, and who at last bad been lost in the desolation of Cawnpore; he would ask them to look at the newspapers, and trace the wondrous courage of little girls and of lone-7 unprotected women-some of high birth, others of hulrnble origin, but in all of whom, in the greatest struggles and in the greatest difficulties, the English character and the English heart had shown themselves supreme. (Applause.) Whatever might be the issue of this conflict, these things would ever remain as the triumphs of their countrymen and countrywomen. (Applause.) Re was not able to talk so glibly as many friends of his as to the causes of this Indian revolt, and he had really hardly any theory upon the subject. His main theory was to see that rebellfon put down with the utmost energy of England (applause) ; his chief point of view was to see regiment after regiment landed at Calcutta and going up the contry. IUntil that was done it was vain, and in some respects ungenerous, to be talking of theories for the government of India, of the faults of the East India Company, and of the deficiencies of men in authority. ITe was the more convinced of that because he hLd looked over this subject very carefully, and he did not find that I any one person connected with India, civil or military, had in the least degree anticipated this event. They would find a great many allusions to mutiny, they wolld find many men talking, as Lord Ellenborough and. Lord Melville talked now, and as Sir Charles Napier talked some time ago, of mutiny in the Indian army, but what they meant was a very different thing; so far as he understood, they meait that the army was unlike other armies, that it refused to move when ordered. that it required higher pay, that it made all sorts of difficulties; but there was no inkling in the minds of any of these men of anything like a general rising in the Bengal army. No one respected Sir Charles Napier more than he did, and he was glad that they had now got a follower of his in India (hear. hear) ; but he could not forget that in 1852 Sir Charles Napier said that the Sepoy wasa gloriouw soldier, notto be corrupted by gold, and I not to be deterred by danger; and that whent Lord Hardinge I bjected to the concentration of large bodies of Indian troops l ogether, Sir Charles sent a muemorandum to Lord Dalhousie 'n the subject, in which he said he could not concur in the objection of Lord Hardinge. Lord Hardinge did appear to have had some idea of a rebellion, and he rememberd Lord Hardinge saying to him a few days before he went to India, ,'I am not afraid of anything I am going to meet but the mutinous spirit of the Bengal army." But when Lord Htardinpe got out, they did not find him doing any. , ing to show that he anticipated a rebellion, and on leaving India he published a general order, in which he spoke of the native army in terms of confidence. Do not, then, let them be too hard upon any great man for this disaster ; do not let it be said, as it was often vulgarly said, that Englishmen required a victim, which was not true. After a calamity, Englishmen required that the causes should be investigated, and that if any one was found guilty he would be punished. No doubt they bad a right to demand how it was that the garrison at Delhi, with its enormous amount of artillery and immense magazines and banks was left without the protection of a single English soldier. (Hear, hear.) This they had a right to demand, and to ascertain how it was that when they I * alitl cakecircul%ted from Qe9 end of indiato the other sutspicion was not arouned; bat do not, as some did, cast all this upon the East India Compaty, and charge it with being guilty of all these things. Did they suppose tbat if the Presidency of Bengal had been a dependency of the English Crown they would have been a bit better ? The East India Company was the only governing body in this country representing the middle classes, and not the aristocracy. It was officered by the sons of the clergy and of those men who formed the marrovr of this country. There had never been a suspiclon of aristocratic influenoe In connexion with it, and if they found fault with this government, they would find fault with a govern. ment of their own, and one in which they were interested. With all their faults the East India Company he believed were free from the taint of corruption, and had governed the country with the best intentions and with justice. Let them compare it wFith the foreign government of Spain and of other countries, and they vould find that the East India Company had purstted a very different policy. ( Hear, hsar.) This he would say, that when this matter came under discussion ln the House of Commons he was not prepared in any degree to attach India by any means to the red tape of Downing-street. Hfe desired that India should bo governed by men experienced in Indian affairs, not thab rising statesmen should be sent out as governors. general- he said that with all respect to Lord Canning, who had done exceedingly well in that emergency, but who would no doubt be ready to admit that it wonld have been better if Sir Henry Lawrenc had been Governor-General; that the Indian army should be led by men who understood the Government of India, and not, as in a late instance, by mea who had only known something of military matters ia England. (Hear, hear.) He would only add one word more. He hoped that no countenance would be given by this country or by Parliament to the vain supposition that England had brought upon herself this great disaster by having asserted herself to be a Christian country. There never was a snore foolish and absurd notion. It had been said by a foreign writer, and he perfectly concurred in it, that if England In India was not a Christian country nobody in the world cared whether she lived or died there. (Hear.) Nro one would suspect him of wishing that the Hindoos should be insulted or tampered with, but he did say, " Let Christianity have full range."' (Hear, hear.) Don't let them at that moment fall from their position as a Christian power, don't let them be afraid to assert that they believed the principles of Christianity to be true and to be the only prmciples upon which society could be safely founded. When they saw what the religion of India had led the people to do, when they saw what Mahomedanism in its ower and Buddhism in its lust bad done, he did not think they should hold back their hands. (Applause.) There was one name connected with tbese events dear to the English people-the name of Sir Henry Havelock. (Cheers.) Ae v weeks ago he had the pleasure of spending a day with the family of that distinguished general, and he never saw a more noble specimen of Christian courage than was presented in Lady Hvolock. Speaking of her husband at the moment of his greatest and extremest peril, she said, " He is only doing now what he has done all his lifedoing his duty, and trusting in God." (Applause.) In conclusion, the hon. member said he trusted that when they met again they would find, he would not say that the war had been concluded, but that this plague of blood, this pestilenco of violence had passed away. (Cheers.) He thanked them for their kindness, which he should remember to the end of his life, and gave " The Health of the Mayor." (Hear, hear.) The MAYOB briefly responded, after which Mr. WOOD rose, and was received with general cheer. ing. He referred st great length to the petition presented against his return by Mr. Oliveira, which he characterized as a shameful and diabolical act, congratulated the constituency on the result of the inquirv before the Parliamentary commnittee, and said that it was too bad, after having contested the borough purely and honestly, he should have had to pay 2,0001. to defend his seat. It was spent, however, in maintaining the character of his native borough, and if it bad been his last shilling he would have paid it willingly. It was not the poor voters who were to lame for what they had done in past years, but the great men, the lawmakers of the country, who had come down and corrupted them. (Applause.) As to India, he could not entirely concur with his hon. colleague, and, either by red tape or white tape, he would have India tied to the Queen of England. (Rear, hear.) He complained of the non-assertion of Christianity in the country, and said that in pursuing that policy the East India Company had disgraced Cbristianity. (Hear, hear ) He believed that the outbreak would eventually be of great service to India, by placing It immediately under the authority of the British Crown, and by affording an opportunity for thoroughly developing its resources. The country must be thoroughly Anglicized, aU restrictions being removed from the settlemenc of Englishmen there and from the expenditure of English capital; and until that was done India would never prosper. (Hear' hear.) Though they had held the country 100 years, and the exports were going on cor.- tinually increasing, there was conparatively no advance in their imports from England, and the Hindoos never would be good customers until the country was thrown open. Last year India took 12 miMlions of silver from this countrv to make up the balance of trade, but he was satisfied that if a few commercial men were settled both in India and China the imports in those countries would soon be materially increased. (Eear, hear.) As to the army, he would allow none but Englishmen to wield English arms. (Hear, hear.) He expressed a strong hope for the prosperity of his native town by the increase of manufactures witbin it, and concluded by giving " The Health of Lord Galway, XMP." Lord GALWAY briefly responded, aud with reference to India, he said he did not think the East India Company were entirely free from blame, It had been the custom of the East India directors to deny all charges made in the House of Commons, and it required a man of no ordinary courage to getup and contradict the denial of a director. He must say that he did not believe the denials of the directora, and recent events had justified hiLm in doing so. The rnischief as to India had been that they had blinked the question; they had been told not to do so and so because it would weaken the Government; men who gave promise of taking an active but independent course on India wereoffered appointments, and recently a gentleman of great promise was offered a place at the Board of Control, anld the official plaister had sealed his lips. (Hear, hear.) He hoped this would not be so in future, and that the subject would be thoroughly investigated. It was necessary it should be so, that the Government of India might be placed upon a firmer bheas, and that there should be no more truckling to the native religious prejudices. (Hear, hear.) So far as he knew of the Opposition, of which he was proud to be a member, he believed they would be ready to leDd every hand to Her Majesty's Government; they did it during the Russian war, and would do it now. (Hear, hear.) He congratulated them on the fall of Delhi, which he hoped was an augury of stil further success, and after deprecating the feeling whch seemed to prevail that their army should go to India more as murderers than as soldiers, he said he trusted that while they punished the guilty they would uot forget to spare the innocent; that while they inflicted stern justice, they would not stek to wreak indiscriminate vengeance. (Applause.) After some other complimentary toasts, the proceedings terminated.
GENERAL HAVELOCIG. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In tbe notice of General Havelock given by Mr. Graham at Belfast, and a copy of which has appeared in your issue of Monday last, thero appears to be some little inaccuraey which it may bo as well to correct. I havo knOwn the General for more than 30 years most intimately, and can say with confidence that he has never baptized any one, neither, in the strict professional sense of the word, oau he be said to have " preached." When he embarked for Burmah in 1824, in company with his regiment, His Majesty'b 13th Fsot, he was in the habit of assembling as many as could be prevailed on to attend for devotional exercises, and he occasionally explained the Scriptures to them in a brief address. They were allowed to assemble at the great Shoey Dagoon pagoda, the glory of Rangoon, and there, in a chamber filled rwith the cross-legged images of Buddha, might be seen little native lamps placed in the lap of the Images, and 100 and more of the soldiers of the 13th around Lieutenant Havelook, singing the praises of the living and true God. Independently of the religious benefit of these services, it was a most desirable object to keep these men from licentious indulgences in a conquered town by the strength of Christian principle. They used to be caUed "Havelock's Saints," and the General-in-Chief, Sir Archibald Campbell, on one oecasion of a sudden alarm at Prome at night, finding it difficult to collect speedily a sufficient body of soldiers, ordered the officer to caU out " lavelock's Saints ;" "I can always," said he, "depend on them. They, at all events, are sober and ready for duty." When he returned to regimental duty he continued to attend to the religious and nmoral wants of his cozpany with conscientious care, and assembled them, as opportunity offered, for religious services. Of course, some were displeased with these "non-military" proceedings, as thoywere called, and various oommunications adverFo to him were made to the Commander-in-Chief. Lord WiUiam Bentinck, and he was described as a strait-laced salnt, a Dissenter, and, withal, a Baptist. Soon after the adjutancy of the corps became vacant, and Licuteuent Havelock was a candidate for it, and very strenuous efforts were made to prevent his nomination. Mrs. Havelock, who happened to be at Serampore-the regiment being then In the North-Westwaited on Lord William to solicit the appointment. He said he could not give a reply till the next day. On her calling a second time he said he had iatermediately sent for a bundle of letters about her husband from Calcutta. "' They are all bostle to him, but before I read them to you I will tell you that I have determined to give the adjutaucv to your husband, because be is one of the best officers in HisMajesty's service. I wi also show you the reply to these attacksin the return which I have ordered of the state of his company, and I find that there is less drunkenness, less fogging, less imprisonment than in any other ;" and then, alluding facetionsly to one o the ocbarges brought against him, said, "Go. and tell Lieutenant Havelock, with my compliments, that I wish he could make Baptists of the wrhole army." AMICUS.
MEMORIAL CHURCHES AT DELII AND CAWNPORE. -At a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, held this day, October 29th, 1857, it having come to the knowledge of the society through the medium of various com. munDcations, both public end private, that many persons were desirous to promote the erection of chaurches as memo. rials of our countrymen who have fallen in battle, or have been treacherously murdered in the cities of Delhi and Cawnpore; it was resolved :-" That the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which has for some years past maintained missions in both those cities, missions whioh have recently been quenched in the blood of their clergy and catechists, is ready to receive and apply any funds which may be contributed for the erection of memorial churches at Delhi and Cawnpore -churches which, while they wil serve as monuments of those who have fallen, may become temples of worship for alv who, in the present or future generations, may be moved by the Holy Spint to ttLn from ead idols to serve the living God." Subscriptions will be zeseivicd for Delhi and Cawnporo jointly or separately.
THE SOLICITORG1ENERAL AT READINGc- A large meeting was held lst evening at Reading, iw celebration of the anniversary of the Philanthropio InAitution, established there many years ago. The dinner was nLmerously attended, and the Solicitor-General (Sir H. S,Keating) met many of his oonatitnents and political friends. MIr. Walford, surgeon, was the president, and he wau sup. ported in his position by several of the principal inhabi- tants. Mr. Pigott, hLP., was detained at home by sev;-%, iUlness, frora which the honourable gentleman has been latterly sufferlng. The CHAaPu&x, after giving tho usua 1 loyal toasts, pro. posed "The Army and Navy." He uid I propose this toast with great confidence and with great pleasure. I think it is our duty to remember them. A nation existmg without an army and a navy we know not. I do not mean to say that the army and navy have made Britain what she is, because I look upon them aM servants to a power higher than themselves. Bat I do feel that they have done much to sustain and to maintain the power and the authority of Great Britain as a nation. (Applause.) I feel that upon this occasion it would ill become us in our capacity as philanthr ,pists not to remember, and that most warnrdy, their heroic deeds, their great sufferings, their deep privation, and sufferings. And if our ears have been permitted to be gladdened with the news of their victory in causing the fall of that once famed city of Delhi, that knowledge has also brought to us the death of hundreds of our fellow-creatures, and therefore that rejoicing is not an unmixed emotion. We cannot but. mourn those who have fallen, and we must sympathize with those who have sustained a loss in this country. (A. pause.) Bat the army and navy are an important instranen', by which the authority or executive of this country is to be maintained, by which our constitution is to be upheld. (Cheers.) They are a power which I believe never exceeds itir, duty, but always bows in ready submission to the authority which gives its orders. (Cheers.) And we, as Englishmen do rightly in remembering them in this our social meeting, and yon will agree with me, I am sure, that the sooner they can terminate their labours in the East and bring peace not only to this country, but also to other nations, the sooner peace can reign throughout the world, the more we and our successors shall be delighted. (Loud. cheers.) The SOLICITOR-GENERAL, in reply to the toast of " The Boroughl Membera," said, ever Aince he had been member for the borough of Reading he had always esteemed it to be the proudest position, not only that he ever had, but that he could hope to attain to. Since last he had the honour of acknowledging a slmilar kindness a change had taken place. It had pleased Her Majesty to appoint hiim her Solicitor-General, and, greatly as he esteemed that honour (and he trusted that he estimated it at its worth), he assured them that ho considered that or any honour to which he could attain as second to the honour of representing that borough in Parliament. He had not forgotten the kindness which his hon. colleague (MIr. Pigott) and himself experienced at the hands of the constituency of Reading when they were at the general election returned without opposition; and when, upon Her Majesty appointing him Solicitor-General-thereby vacating his seat, and bringing him back to his constituents to ask them for a renewal of their confidence-he could' not forget the kindness with which he was received and the manner in which he was met by persons of al politics in the borough. He was conscious that he could not during his Parliamentary career have done anything to deserve that confidence. All that he could pretend to was a sincere wih to discharge the duty wh:ch he had taken upon himself. EHe had not represented the borough of Reading so long as his hon. friend Mr. Pigott, yet he had represented it some years; and every year he held that distinguished position had increased the marks of favour which he had received from the town on every occasion of his having presented himself. He felt pleased that, meeting as they did for a philantbropic object, the gloom which had overspread the face of the country in consequence of recent disastrous events appeared to be about to disperse. It was a malter of pleasuro and also of congratulation that at length those clouds which had obscured the horizon seemed gradually to brighten, and he trusted would soon disperse. (Cheers.) They must congratulate themselves that while those clouds still hung over them, and while tbe assistance of all right-nminded and good-feeling men throughout the land was required, the borough of Beading was not behindhand. (Cheers.) They had seen the magnificent and truly philanthropic subscription from this borough, which added to the credit it had already maintained. He sincerely hoped that we had heard the worst of the nesss which was to come upon us from the far distant regions of India. (Hear, hear.) He thought that it must bea subject of pride aDd coDgratulation, in the midst of the misfortunes that had fallen upon us, to consider that those very misfortunes had given, rise to displays of English courage, energy, effort, and perseverance which must impress the nations of the world with the convicion. that the prestige of England had in no way diminished. (Cheers.) Wc had seen instances in India not merely of military glory, but instances of courage. of energy, and of perseverence upon the part of that handful of Europeans who remained in that mighty empire without extraneous assistance that must have struck aU Europe with admiration. (Applause.) It was a subject of the deepest congratulation-he would say of thankfulness also, that the great event which had lately taken place was the destruction of the stronghold of those miscreants that possessed it, and the utter annihilation of the shambles in which those butcher, of humanity reveUed. (Applause.) It was a subject of congratulation to think that that had been achieved before the arrival of one of the 40,000 bayoneus despatched from this country across the seas to their assistance. (Cheers.) He would say that the effort which sent across those 40,000 men within the short space of a few weeks after the news arrived, which found this oountry disarmed and in its peaceful garb, when this country had reduced its war establishment upon the proper cry of the people, in which cry the town of Reading and himself took p art-he would say that when taxation war reduced and the country was disarmed the effors made by the Government of the country in sending out the enormous force it did under such circumstances, and at such a time, across the wide ocean to vindicate the rights and honour of this country was without a parallel in the history of England. (Applause). The Solicitor-General afterwards dilated upon topics which were only of local interest.
HE UEIBERSRFsOR EASV SOMERSEr OV THE INDIAS MUTINY. Mr. W. MILES, U.P., in acknovwledging his health at the meeting of the Farrington Gurney Agricultural Atssocia. tion, said that on an occasion like the present it was generaUly expected that a representative should declare his opimon on tho most important public measures of the day. He believed that if ever there was a questiou on which unanimity provaUled throughout the country among all classes it was that of the Indian mutiny. They could not but look back with horror and the deepest disgust at what had taken place in that country -a country in which we had been known for upwards of a, century as Englishmen-a country in which we had endeavoured as muct as we possibly could, and with great success, to educate, and at the saute timiie, as far as Government could, to do good to the natives; and yet, at a period when it waslittle expected, though foreseen by soae who had been many yeers resident there, a mutiny had broken. out which had put in jeopardy our Indian cmpire, and in which had been exhibited horrors of the most detestable character. He was always for mercy when mercy could be fairly meted out, but one cry had gone through this country-that of summary vengeance upon such scoundrels as, despising our rule, had wreaked their vengeance on unofiending wvomen and children. Not only our countrymen, but our countrywomen and their children, had been massacred, aud until a thorough expiation took place England, ho was proud to think, would never be satisfied. That a great change must take lace in the government of India he had no doubt; that was a subject which was growing in the minds of aU men who gave it the least consideration. At present, however, they had nothing to do with what the future government of India should he. But of this he thought there could be no doubt, that a double government could no longer e(ist, that the Qaeen must rule supreme in that country, and the who'e of the Ministers maust be subject to the control of pu71ic opinion rather than, under an Indian board. The ch'irman had aUluded to the heroismn of those little bands who had withstood such onslaughts in India. Great as had been their prowess, did ib not strike all who had thought uponi the subject that if a Providence from on high had not directed their hands-if the Almighty, whom we revered, had not been with them, their strength would have been idle, and no longer should we have mnantained our dominion in India? Providence had been seen in aU their acts, in all their heroism; and he was proud to say that in almost evary oneof thoseshortandsoldier-likeletters coming from General lIavelock the first power he alluded to was the Almighty, as gaining the victory. So long as we trusted in the Almighty hand-so long as ,we did everything in our power to promulgate Christianity throughout idolatrous lands, If we only prayed and supplicated, if we only looked for aid from on bigh, the Lord would defend us. It was under His power that the little bands in India had gone forth to iight; they had been maintained by that po aner, ad by it he believed the enemies oE England wro,ddyet be subjupted. Such was his beliefsuch, he felt convinced, must be the belief also of those who had hitherto been enabled to withstand such multituzdes. Those treacherous mutineers were men wbo had beea trained in our own service-men who had proved themselvegood soldiers in many a fight; and yet when they had turned! against us-when they had spurned the hand thit cherishecl them, and which had brought Christianity and ciailization among them-there had been a power extended to save us and to show to the world that England was destined to go' torth and conqfuer by the exhibition of the cross. Mr. W. F. 2ATCTH1l;U1.L, I.. P., in alluding to the rime subject, speaking of the murders and atroetties comnmitted in India, said he trusted that these dreadful butcheries would speedily mneet with the chastisement they deserved, and that the troops now arriving in India would i:,'dict just vengeance both upon the instigators and p-rpetrators of the 2nurders which had disgraced that land. He felt confident that the generalship of Sir Colin Campbell, aided as he was by those Generals and the smaU bands that hitherto had kept their gronnd against thousands, would be able in a short time to put an end to that mutiny, and so. bring peace and prosperity again into the country. ELe fully concurred in everything that had been said by his hon. coUeague on this subject, and they might rely upon his giving his most earnens consideration to everything that. was brought forwrrd bearing upon it.
