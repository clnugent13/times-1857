StORBY-MARKETataOITYMSC?IG.BNC,R. --------- 4w--- Satlrday Evnlng The funds opened tW morning at a decline of kn Zigbth fr'ci the d:Z quotations of yesterday, and toAme O uclative sales having been effected in the kmtieipation that the fllu advices by the India mail would add to the discouragement already produced by the telegraphio announeements, a further fall took place, the market generally presenting a very leavy appearanace. On the delivery of the letters, i 3however, a much better feeling was awakened. The reports from the money-markets are not 'amfavourable, the prices of most descriptions of amisoellaneous securities beinz fairly uDheld, and a prospect being entertained that subscriptions will be made to the New Five per Ceat. Loan on the terms judiciously offered by the Govermnment of receiving payment one-half in cash and the re-. mainder in Four per Cents. At the same time the Bank of Bengal appear to have considered it safe to mnake a relaxation in their rate for discounting ]lint eertificates and Treasury draughts. Urnder thesecircumstances there wa a disposition on the part of the operators to close the adverse transactions effected during the morning, and a rebound occurred of g per cent. The announcement of t'e arrival of the Persia from New York with 350,0001. in specie contributed to the change of tone. Consola for money were first quoted 90i to i, whence they receded to 90 to i. From this they returned to 90k to i, 'whence aftor the delivery of the Indian letters they improved to 901 to i. For the 9th of September there were ultimately buyers at 90i. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 215i; Reduced, 90k; New Three per Cents., 91; India Stock, 211 to 213; India Bonds, 20s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s3. disoount to par. The transactions in the foreign stock-market have been very limited. Turkish closed at a fractioual advance. Mexican were negotiated for the account at 22; Russian Five per Cents., 112; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 941 and i; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99X; and for the account, 99e fial quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. for money and 66f. 95c. for the present account, showing a slight increase of steadiness. About 8,Q001. of Russian gold was sold to the Bank to-day. The accounts from New York this evening mention a further heavy fall in the stock-market, consequent partly upon the shipment of 520,0001. just made by the Baltic and the Persia. The discovery of an over issue of stock by the Southern Michigan Railway Company had also operated badly, byreviving the distrust engendered from similar causes a year or two back. From Havannah the intelligence z4ti New York illustrates the inevitable effects of the Credit Mobilier system. For the last vear new banking and other companies have incessantly been announced, and in some cases the shares have app reached 120 premium. The break-u p has nowv become general, and to uphold the credit even of the principal establishment in the island-the Spanish Bank-the merchants have been obliged to come forward with a personal guarantee to the extent of 1,500,0001. The commercial advices from Australia by the European are not unsatisfactory. At Melbourne, according to a circular of Messrs. Dcunistoun, Brothers, and Co., the stocks of goods on the gold fields were believed to have been brought within moderate compass, and there was an expectation of an active trade in October, supposing the arrivals in the interval to be not excessive. The gold receipts to date (25th of June) had been 4,210,6761., against 5,273,9121. in the corresponding period of 1856, showing a falling off of 1,063,2361., attributed to carcity of water. From Sydrtey Messrs. Prost, Kebler, and Co. state that the importmarLets had assumed a more healthy tone, chiefly from the assumption that the advices of the previous monthrs will have checked the recklessness of the consignments from Europe. Most articles of produce were very high, and wool had been delayed from coming forward by heavy inundations in the Interior. The contract for a monthly steam servic vid Panama had been provisionally agreed to 'with the agent of the Royal Mail Company. It is to be for seven years; the Government of New South Wales are to pay the whole of the required Eubsidy of 50,0001., and the home Government are to be requested to negotiate the details on behalf of the colony. Among ships lately sailed was the Nourmahal, from Sydney for London, with 26,000 sovereigns and 13,3361. in golddust. From Melbourne the Moatmorency had sailed on the loth of June with 50,1951. The Angio-Saxon and True briton had also been among recent departures, and the Norfolk, advertised for the 5th of July, would take, it is said, 400,0001. A prospectus has been issued of the Red Sea Telegraph Comlpany, with a capital of 300,0001.,for constrting the first sect;ion-Alexandriato Aden-of a line to India. The India Company have guaranteed a minimum annual revenue of 20,0001. on this portion, subject to the approval, yet to be obtained, of the Board of Control. Ultimately it is contemplated to extend the cable to Kurrachee, but meanwhile the proposed section would, it is stated,reduce the distance from India to one week. A purchase of the Atlantic cable is proposed. The following is an abstract of the railway intelligence of the week :-At a meeting of the SouthEastern a dividend of 9s. per 301. stock was declared. The gros receipts for the half-year amountedto 502,5231., against 503,1771. in the correspondigperiod of 1856, and the working expenses to 258,5561., against 267,3211.; the result bineing an increase of 8,1111. in the net receipts. The decrease in the gross revenue is attributed to the circumstance that in 1850 there was, a large exceptional traffic from the return of soldiers from the war and from the camps situated on the line. The closing of the Greenwich fairs has also caused A considerable loss. The report of the Great Northern shows the gross receipts for the past lalf-year to have been 577,6311., or 9,7911. more than in the corresponding period of 1S56. The expenditure was 296,9551., leaving a balance of 280,6761. being an increase of 16,4251.. to which is to be added 8,4001. due from the Eastern Counties. At a meeting of the West End and Crystal Palace the accounts showed that the receipts had been 409,7901., and the expenditure 373,838. The balance will be applied towards debenture interest. The works between the Sloane-street station and Wandsworthcommon have made such progress as to insure an early opening of the line throughout. The local traffic from the CrYstal Palace to Wandsworth is highly satisfactory. At a meeting of the Monk. land the dividend was at the rate of 8 per eent. Increased expendituLre has been occasioned by extending the de6tos for the augmented 3nineral traffic from the new branches. Authority was given to raise 33,1201. upon shares under the Act of 1848 and 137,0001. by the creation of new share-. At the Maryport and Carlisle the accounts showed an increase in the receipts of 2,1221 and in the expenditure of 1511. The rolling stocklhas been greatly improved, and a considerable portion of the line has been doubled and relaid. The increase in the trafflc has been principally in connexion with the shipment of coals and iron ore. A dividend was declared at the rate of o per cent. per annum upon all the shares of the company, both original and preferential. The Epsom and Leather. head Railway will be completed by the 1st of January. The company have met with obstructionsin obtaining possession of land, in one cae a sum of- 5,5701. being demanded for 24 acres. The proprietors have been authorized to raise 10,0401. on debentures or bonds. At the first meeting of the Wimbledon and Dorking it was announced that a satisfactory arrangement for working the line has been entered into with the South Wester The works Wil be completed o0 the 1st of May. The issue of debentures for 23 000. was approved. The divi- dend of the N,rth Yorkshire . and Cleveland is 2j per cent; Authority was gfven to borrow 60,0001. on debentureg. Negotiatios areiii progress with the vicw of carryng the lie .to GrO5mont. The Bill for the Newtowni and Machynlleth Railway has passed. The report of the ILlanidloes and Newtown states that that lna WV slwrtly be opened to Scafell. As soon as pticawI it is intended to apply to Parliament fci power to lease it. The directors believe that sttpx wiU be taken to obtain a Bill for a railway #kom Uanidloea to Liandovery, ompleting a direet communicatioa from 3filford Haven to Manchester. nTe diyidlnd ,at the Norfolk meeting was 30s. per cent,, bhiP Ss. more than tor tlt torXsponding p8fiIof ei1856. ~the trafflc bhis graMafly increased), u4itX^tr lOountin t)onpany, who work thc line, have r:e-, duce{A *s±e cost from 61 to a little wneX than 4O6er ceunt The directors were authorized to ramse 50,0001. by the ssue of 10,000 51. shares, at a guaranteed interest of - per cent., to liquidate a claim of the Eastern Counties. The report of the Bradford, Wakefield, and Leeds states that three weeks wilU yet be required to finish the works. The delay in opening the line will entail a loss of 8,0001. or 9,0001. The dividend of 4 per cent. payable under contract by Messrs. Brassey and Field on all the, shares of the Leominster and Kington will accrue from the 1st of July. At the Taif Vale the dividend declared- was m accordance with the report. Tjpwards of 10,0001. has been carried over to provide for ary deficiency in the present or succeeding half-year, consequent upon the reduction of 25 per cent. in their tariff. Nei docks will soon be opened at Cardiff; another dock is also about to be constructed by the Ely lidal Harbour Company. The 'Taff Vale Waggon Company has been registered under the Limited Liability Act. A call of of 21. per sharehai been made, and the waggons purchased are ia. course of delivery.- At the meeting of the Metropolitan 1ailway the chairman stated that, the negotiations with the Great Western and Great Northern having entirely failed, it is not cobsidered advisableto go on. The ultimate loss wil be about 6s. per share. A caU of lOs. has been made, whicb, in the event of a favourable winding-up, will be returned. A dividend of 11. has been declared upon the firstclass preference shares of the West London, in addition to the 21. declared in March last. The North Devon dividend is 18s. per share, which wil absorb the whole of the balance within 21. The report of the Bideford Extension states that the rent received from Mr. Brassey is appropriated to the payment of the debts of the company, and that no dividend can be declared at present. The contractor's claim is to be taken in shares. The first sod of the South Durham and Lancashire was cut on T'uesday at Kirkby Stephen, in Westmoreland. This railway will complete the connexion between the east and west coast across Durham, Westmoreland, and Lancashire. At a meeting of the Bristol and Exeter the dividend declared was in accordance with the report. A great portion of the pleasure traffic has been diverted to the north of England, chiefly on account of the Art Treasures Exhibition; and the opening of the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth has also had an unfavourable effect. At a meeting of the Sittingbourne aud Sheerness it was stated that the company has obtained possession of more than half the land, and that the main line and branches will probably be completed by next spring. The Bill for the junction with the East Kent and for the extension to Sheerness has received the Royal assent. The report of the Ambergate, Nottingham, and Boston shows a deficiency of 5751. in the net receipts as compared with the same period of last year. A dividend of 2s. 9d. per share is recommended. The mineral traffic continues greatly depressed. The East Anglian show an increase of 2,0801. in the receipts over the corresponding period of 1856. The working expenses have been reduced to about 46 per cent. After paying the dividends upon all the preference stocks 6321. is carried forward as the commencement of a fund appliceble to the ordinary stock. The ilverstone and Lancaster line has been opened. It forms the connecting link between the Furness and Whitehaven and the Lancaster and Carlisle, and will greatly facilitate the conveyance of iron ore to Staffordshire and other places in the south. The Edinburgh and Glasgow receipts show an increase of 10,9601. as compared with last year, together with a reduction in the working expenses of 6,1711. The dividend is at the rate of 3 per cent. The Scottish Central has joined in the agreement existing with the Caledonian, and the three companies have concluded an arrangement with the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. The works on the Carmarthen and Cardigan line are progressing. A' a meeting of the East Kent explanations were given respecting the non-opening of the line. Although the Bil giving them an independent access to London has been thrown out by the Lords, the directors will again apply next session. Eight miles between Strood and Faversham are open, and eight more are ready for ballasting. The dividend of the Eastern Union for the past half-year is 15s. on the A stock and 10s. on the B and C, showing an improvement. Steps are being taken for the issue of the Five-and-a-Half per Cent. Guaranteed Stock already sanctioned. The works upon the Woodbridge line are progressing. A dividend of 6s. per share has been declared on the shares of the Whitehaven Junction. It is intended to apply to Parliament for power to raise additional capital to lay the road with heavier rails and to increase the carrying stock. The receipts of the Whitehaven and Furness are sufficient to pay for the first time a full dividend on the preference stock. Authority has been obtained from Parliament to raise 70,0001. upon new preference shares. The opening of the Lancaster and Ulverston is expected to cause a great increase of traffic. At a meeting of the South Yorkshire a dividend was declared at the rate of 2i per cent. per annum. The receipts show an increase of 10,8741., and the expenses of 5,2861., over the corresponding period of 186. Thereportof theLeeds, Bradford, and Halifax Junction state that the Ardsley branch is completed, and that the company only await the opening of the Bradford, Wakefield, and Leeds to eommence the traffic. The revenue for the quarter ending June 30 has been 6,9081., and the expenditure 1,2951. A dividend on the quarter of 5 per cent. is proposed. The usual dividend of 6s. per share is recommended on the Dundalk andEnniskillen. The proposed dividend of the Dublin and Belfast is at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, being a reduction of 1. per cent., owing to the fact that no income arising from interest on calls in arrear has been lately received. The report of the Dublin and Wicklow shows the result of the second half-year's working of theentirerailway, including the Kingstown line. The dividend recommended is 3s. per share. The revenue of the London and South-Western shows a decrease of 11,7601., attributed to the fMlling-off of the receints in the carriage of troops, and to the competition of other companies. A dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum is recommended. At a meeting of the Wimbledon and Croydon a 4 per cent. per annum dividend was declared, leaving 1301. The report of the Lancashire and Yorkshire states that the net revenue for thle past half-year is 371,2481., enabling a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. The West Cornwall show an increase in traffic in every branch, except copper ore, on which there is a serious falling-off. The Wells and Fakonham line is complete, with the exception of the Wells Harbour branch and the tramway along the quay. The opening is delayed only until arrangements have been made with the Eastern Counties and Norfolk for the completion of a junction with them, for station accommodation at Fakenham, andfor workingtheline. At a meeting of the Warrington and Stockport it was announced thatapplicationwillbemado to Parliament forpower to raise 33,8761., vhich, with the unissued stock, amounting to 20,4901., will provide for all unsecured loans and liabilities. A profit of 5251. has been made and applied in reduction of a deficit of 8501. on the previous half-year. The East Lancashire dividend is at the rate of S per cent. The road is stated to be in better repair than when under contract. The dividend recommended on the Somerset Central is at the uwual rate of 4 per cent. per annum. The directors propose to raise 17,0001. on preference shares to complete the line to Wels. The extension to Burnham is finished, and will shortly be opened for general traffic. The amendment for a Committee of Investigation at the meeting of the London and Blackwall last week was negatived by a majority of 48 to 40. .

STATR OF TJADE. MANCRESTER, A'uo. 29. The entire business of the week hsa not been inoonsiderable, either in yarns orcloh. altlough this market has been a remarkable contrat to the exted spectadIo presented in. that for the raw etaple at Liverpool. We had some little faverishness here on Tuesday, wheft cotton waa obheryed to be agisn large demand speculatively and prices made another spring; but since then the buIness has been of a Vaet and more steady character, and manafacturers have otund grat difculty in cong ihe advances in price for cdoth vich have been rendered necessary by the increased cost of cotton and cu.n. S inners are aking fully id. per lb. more than a..Wee for all Lindi of yarn, and the large orders they hold, independently of new business, gives them mord ommand of terms The price of cothon is'bigber than thoso who havehad he longest experience in business couldave believedposible twelve months ago, yet prices keep advacng, sa tos of goods and yarns scramble after them. In the attrr there Is great irregularity, some kinds of cloths havingremalned comparatively stationar for some weeks past (such a India jaconots, which have attractedthe attenton of spclators within the laat fovr day5i. while others find a read sle at full rates. The prospect of an exceUent and well-gathered harves. gives hope to the home tade while foreign markets are found still capable of taking age supplies, and the week closes with fully as good prospects of busness as any we have had for some time past. BIRMINGHAM, AUG. 29. The copper and bras trades of the town and neighbourhood have this week been qaln disturbed by another advance in the price of copper. On Wednesday a rise of lId. per lb. was declared upon manufactured oopper, and 41. lOs. per ton upon tUe coke. Some of the manufacturers subsequently announced a cormponding advance In the prioes of brass goods, but we cannot hear that generally the brass-founders have issued any circulars exacting higher discounts, or that any Intention exists to vary the price lists lst Issued. This upward movement, which, as a matter of course, originated with the smelters, was not altogether unexpected. Limited in;ortations and increased demands for home manufactures led to the belief that such would be the consequence. The moderation of the advance is, however, a matter of congratulation, and if it proceeds no further, whicb, however, is extremely questionable, those unpleasant results to tho winter trade which high prices necearily oocsion may be fortunately avoided. At present the brass foundries of the town are busy, but frther advances would render the manufacturers reluctant to make for stock, and the opetives of the town and neighbourhood would consequently be the chief sufferers at a season of the year when auald trade is most severely felt. The iron trade of South Staffordshlre remains firm, and the inclination is rather towards an advance than a reduction of quotations. The leading firms are well off for orders and are reluctant to make sales for delivery at existing prices. Should the foreign demand continue to increase it is not improbable that an advance may be declared at the preliminary meeting of the trade, which wi be held in the course of the next montb,and the contracts on hand aresufI ficient to keep the principal establishments of the district well employed over that period. The coal trade, whic for the last fortaight or three weeks has been brisk, is inereseingly active. The opening of the Cannock Branch Railway, in connexion with tho London and North-Western and South Staffordshire, which is expected to take place in the course of a few weeks, will still further increase this important local trade, and render the resources of a new and extensive mineral district readily available, not only to the midland counties, but to the whole of the kingdom. Unusually large orders havo this week been received for Birmingham manufactures from Australia. Of late years exportations from this neighbourhood have 'be limited, and, consequently, stocks in Melbourne had become extremely low. From the advices received by Birmingham houses from their agents there is now a great demand for all descripUons of hardware and ironmongery ; the order of one merchant firm amounting, it is said, to not less than some hundred tons in weight. There is little change in the general condition of the varied trades and manufactures of the town. Business is not, as a whole, over active; but in most of the leading concerns there is an average amount of work on hand. The season of the year when certain articles arc in request renders some branches busy, while slackness prevails in other not inflaenced by the special requirements of the autumn and winter trades. The Ordnance and East India Company contracts keep the gn manufacturers who are favoured with them actively employed, while the birding branch is much busier than it has been for some months past. Among the trades of Birmingham which at the present period are the most active is the pearl button manufacture. Notwithstanding the continued high priOe of shell in the districts of the town where it is chiefly carried on the workshops are in full work, and now, fortunately, the late disputes between the masters and workpeople are aicably arranged business proceeds most satisfactorily. The Council of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce at a meetlng held during the present week, again discussea the proposed amendment of the Bankruptcy IAws. The members of the Birmingham Chamber are not satisfied with the measure proposed by the London Law Committee, and they awe anxious that the reforms introduced should be of a far more extensive and practioal nature than those conttemplated in the measure proposed by the latter body. They have accordingly determined, if possible, to introduce tho subject at the meeting which is to be held in this town in October for the promotion of social science (over which Lord Brougham is to preside;, and it is hoped that, with the aid of deputations from other commercial chambers of the kingdom, their vews of bankruptcy reform, s distinguished from those of the I;ondon Law Society, may ultimately NOTTINGHAM, AUG. 29. There is rather more activity in the lace trade this week, and, considering that this is a usually quiet season of the year, trade is in a healthy state. More business is expeoted to be done shortly for the home market, and there is a little more inquiry for wide laces. Most branches are, howaver, quiet, but it is satisfactory to think that there is an average amount of business doing. Silk continues at an exceedingly high rate, with no immediate prospect of a reduction. Cotton is also very high. The hosiery trade stMll remains exceedingly dul; some branches have not been so flat for a considerable time ast. In the cotton shirt and pantaloon business great duleass prevails. Hosiery, silks, and yarns are no cheaper. There has been a private meeting this week of manufacturers and others interested in the project of establishing a dhiect line of railway cammunication between Nottingham and Boston, the mayor presiding. The object of the meeting was to afford an opportunity to those present to express their opinion as to the capabilities of that port to meet the requirements of the trade of this district, and hot* far the project appeared lkely to prove of advantage to the town end trade of Nottingham. The feeling of the meeting was strongly in favour of the scheme. LEIOESTER, AUG. 29. The improvement noticed in the hosiery trade last week continues, and orders in hand are tolerably numerous. At Loughborough, Hinckley, and the country districts the operatives have been working in the harvest field, and trade in these districts is not brisk. The wool-market is firm, and late prices are fully maintained. Worsted yarns are atill very dear, and spinners are working full time. GLOCESTER, AuG. 29. We have still to report a declining condition of the staple trades of this port, which have never recovered the shock experiencedduringtheRusesan war. Othereircumstances too, have contributed to divert the trade of the district into other ports of the Bristol ChanneL We have to report one failare of a house in the timber trade i n a large way of business. Mr. W. Cassie, an extensive railway contractor and converter of timber in a large way, has stopped payment, and his liabilities are estitated at upwards of - 80,0001. It may be remembered that Mr. Cassie, in connexion with the firm of Price and Co., of this port, was the contractor for the timber Crimean huts, sent from this country during the Russian war, and which were manufactured and shipped at Glocester in an incredibly ahort spacea of time. Price and Co. are the largest creditors. Their claim, it Is said, amounts to between 60,000l. and 70,0001. ont of the 80,0001. liabilities. Most of the other creditors are carrying on trade in Glocester. Meetings of the creditors have been held here, and trustees appointed to wind u the affairs. It is stated that the faiure has been occasioned by heavy losses on some large contracts, and especially on a contract for providing timber for a local railway. LEEDS,. AUG. 29. The markets this morning were of a stetady character, there being an average attendance of buyers and a fair amount of business done. There is an entire absencea of speculation, and the tone of business transactions generally is quict, and though there has been a decided improvement during the week, many country buyers having been here, the business done can scarcely be considered as an average for the time of year There IS nothing, however, like depression, and there 1s the prospect of a good winter irade. The market report of the I=sedigencr tbis morning states: -" Black union cloths are in fair demand, and also thick fancy goods. For ordinary white cloth, however, there was scarcely any inquiry, and merohLants will ran down their stocks before purchasing at present prices." Ruled as those prices necessarUly are by the prlce of wool, we cannot look forward to any early reduction, but that. the trade is healthy and sound, notwithstanding the high price of the raw material, is evident from tho returns just publisheyby the Board of Trade, which show a large progressive increase or exports in woollen goods. Itispro. bable that this increase may be partially augmented by German and Belgin cloths re-exported from this country, but it is mainly due to the increased export trade frbm the I clothing distrists. This increase continues notwithstandIng the constant declaration that our goods are, bing driven ! out of foreign markets, and that our export trade is in jeopardy. Our-mrchants stiUnmaintain their power to com. yete with the foreign merchant inthe cheaperca6ssof goods, a nd are likely to do so, for by some extraordinary rans. mutation they always succeed in manufacturing a ceaop article with riSing prices In theS rawr material. No douwbt | is Ia done atts cot of th@ qualizty wbi~ I dab pro ratO by the introduction of %shoddy and cotton, which latter aztile is in many cases h<ng bt, with the wool for thb We£t M wA4l a tiingused for the warp, .... manufactuarers keep well etbployec, and now ,hit the harvest iS nearly over and the crops stacked, generally n gcod condition, the prospects for the winter are satisfactory. Labour is in fair demand, and tho working Qli5ses throughoat the district are well off. The, wool trade continnes frm, without any alteration 4eerig of notice. HAULFAX, AuG. 29. There was no alteration In the marketthismorning, excepting that wool wss a little firmer. Worsted and yarns remain as before. Daring the week there has been observable some aight improvement, and in damnasks and piece goods generally there has been a fair sale. There is more inquiry for lastlugs, which would sell readily if they could be offered at the price which ruled a fe vweeks ago, and ia wap yairn t'ae demand is considerable. BRADFORD, AuG. 29. The worsted trade continues to maintain theimproveaent notioed in Our last report. The pieco department is generallyin a satisfactory condition, especiallyasregards the home trade, in which ther3 Is some activity manifeated just now; tho foreign houses, although under fair engagements, are notdoing quite'an average busineas for the season, which is USuall to a considerable extent. Prices have EsadUy advancd bat, as manufacturers aver, not to au amxmUl Commensurate with the high cost of production. Ia the merchants' warehouses during the week there has been a good attendance, and a very fair basiness is transacting. he progpects of trade in the worated district are considered favourable. The yarn trade experincoes a better tone. As regards worstc yarns, the purchasers for shipping p osea on expenrendng little or no prospect of a decin prlc, but, on the contrary, every probability of a further advance have had to acoede to the prioes demanded by spinners; henoe they have at lastocome forward more freely with their orders, and spnners have entered into some rather extensive con- i traots. There is al8o more activity prevalent in the hone houese and altogether a better aspect is presented In this mportant department of our trade. An upwaid tedenc prevails in the prices of cotton yarns, conseqnent on the ad. I vance in the raw material and increased brimknesm in the Lancashire markets. The lower numbers of warps are quoted id. higher. The wool-market Is firm. There is a good supply of wool In the hands of the stplers, and sales are to an average extent, with more healthiness in the general tone of the market. Longtapled combing qualities are in greater demand, and altough there is an absence of speculation, and b%inners merely purchase individually to the limit of their a oluto requirements, they are compelled to pay the full rates recen'ly current, whioh are demanded by eat$ers writh great finmnues, and in the aggregate a good weight of the staple is changing hands. In clothing wools there is no change of moment to report either in demand or pice; noils and brokee continue scarce, and most short wools on offer are readily purchased at full rates. DUBLIN, AUG. 29. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday, 27th of August, induive were 19,1334. against 16,656M last week. BELFAST, AUG. 2S. Linen.-We have no alteration to notice this week in an branch of the linen trade. Stocks are light and the trade healthy. Linen Yarn.-The demand for yarns continues good at late rates, and stocks are unusually small for this season of the year. Flax.-Tho oontinued dry weather, although assistlng the Iretting of the flax straw in the pool, and drying it on the grass, prevents the scutch mills from working; and It is only in those districts where steam is used that the farmers have been enabled to get anr quantity prepared for market. Spinners continue to hke the quat of what they have bought. The yield is very good from the hackle. The Belfast trade is more active in all its branches. Sales of gray goods are not large; but, as a better spirit is stirred in the fancy trade, and as sew ed musln people are likely to have a good trade for the winter, the demand for gry goods suited to that departent of the cotton manufacture will nowr become more active.

Awrur THmiDEnRsToum.-Omagh was visited by a fearful thunderstorm on last Monday evening. For two or three days previous the weather had been very close and sultry, and very dark at intervals, particularly in the evenings. About mida yon Monday the glass tmrned rapidly to "change," and untlihalf-past 6 the clouds were getting thiocer. About that time the rain began to fall-at first siightly, bkt In a few minutes after very heavil ; at 15 minutes before 7 the lighbtning flashed vividly, and the thun. der followed in awful rattles, as if bursting over the town. FlPh and elad tollowed each other in r&pid succession, and the ralsi pored ti tofients for about 20 minutes, after which the thnUler besicne more distant, and soon ceased, the lightning changing to the sheet descrip. tion, which nsshed away and illumined the ooun. try round every two or three seoonds for many hours, the rain also bing much lighter. No damago was done by the tonrm about this town; not so, however, in other parts of the district, for at Ednafogary, .Athin two mUes of Fintona, Mr. John Young was instantly silled by the electrio fluid in his own house. It appean he had been out super. nltending his labourers until the rain drove him into the house, and when standing at the parlour fireplaco, calmlng the feas of his wife and daughter (who were greatly torn. fied), he wa *trumk on the forehead by the electric current, and fell a corpse Into his daughter's arms. Mr. Young's awfully sudden death has created a great sensation in the neighbourhood. He was one of the most independent and respectable farmers in the country-liberal, up* ht, and honourable-a hospitable and kind frend,-and will be long and sincerely regretted. We regret to say that Mr. Young's was not the only low of life we haye to record. A fine boy of about 10 years of ago, youngest son of Mr. John Ruseell, of Ardstraw-bridge, when driving home some cows, was struck by a flash of lightning and killed on the spot. An elder brother, who was a short dis. tance from him, on seeing him fall, ran up to him, telling him not to be frightened, as the danger was now past, but found on examination that the lad was quite dead. A woman named Biddy Donnely, of Coash, near Dungannon, was making hay with Alexander Gault; she left for home about 7 in the evening, but did not return home. Next evening she ws found lyIg dead in a small stream of water, about half-way to her own bouse. There were no marLs on her person, and the belief is that she was killed by the lightning, as the storm was raging there at the time. We have afso heard that a man was killed near Pomeroy that evening while In bed with his brother, who was not Injured; that another man was killed at Orritor, about the same time, and thxt many animals were killed on the mountains and fields in many parts of the country. In several parts of the county of Donegal the storm was equally severe. Two young men namedJanmes Graham and Andrew Irvne, on their return from thefair of Milford to their regl. dence, near Kilmacrenan, were instantaneoudy killed. hmree other persons who acconpanied them were prostrated by the shock, but reoived ooeaparatively little injury. The wife of a farmer near Pamelton had accompanied the servantmaid totLUbyre forthepurposeof milking the cows, but became so terrified that abe returned to the dwellnghouse, the girl ridiciuling her timidity; the servant, however, within a few minutes after, when coming out of the byre, was s'ruck down, and hau remained ever since in a state of Insensibility. In the vicinity of Buncrans a horse, the pro- of r Daniel Martin, was kdlled in the stable, being struck by the lightnlng, which penetrated through the roof, A meu named Ba[adrlk, in the neighbourhood of Newtowau cunningham, had two pigs killed by the destructive filid.

We have It on the highest agricultural authority that the wheat crop in this couinty was never meen bettev nor more free from smut, mildew, or any other disease, and sesldom has It been gathered in with so little injury from the weather.

OAI3BRIDGT, AvG. 29. The weather has been splendid during the past week. and harvesting has been carried on rapidly; the crops have, generally speaklun, been housed In very fine condition. The yield In moot dLctrlots is proving gcod, and the injnry sustained by the heavy rabin. Is here con5ldemable than was anticIpated In the neighbourhood of Great Shelford har' vest operations are nearly brought to a, close, alt sorts of grain, having tcon secured In excellent condition. Around Cottingbam, also, the &ame esatisfactory pregress ha-s been made, and the c.ops are higbly ,poken ef. In the district of Newmarket the wheat crop has proved a good one, averaging about ten coomba per acre.

ARTILLR1YAPPOINTMENTS AT ADDISCOMBE. TO THE[ EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have just seen in your impressiorn of yesterday the letter of <' One who has friends at Addiscombe," &o., remarking on the injustice of the intended nomination by the Court of Directors of the East India Company of 66 direct Artillery cadets "over the heads of those at pres6nt at Addiscombe." Permit me to call your attention to a stil greater act of Injustice, which Ifear they will in that Instance commit. I am acquainted with two cadets who at the recent examinations at Addiscombe passed for Artillery, but were not allowed by the regulations to have appointments in that corps, in consequence of two cadets who were above them in the aggregate number of marks not havin; so passed. Surely, if any extraordinary addition -was to be made to that branch of the service, these two young men should immediately be appointed before any others and take precedence.

TE[9 WU T I N I E S ~IN DIA*.- JA porlon of the following appeared h o second odtNOnof $aturday:-] By tse arrival of the Overland Mail we %&ve received our private correspondence and papors from Bombay to July 30th; Calcutta, July 20th; and Bongkong, July 10th. * The following is the letter of our Bombay correspondent, dated Bombay, July 30:_ " I closed my last letter with a somewhat confident expression of hope that when next I wrote I should be ablo to announce to you the capture of Delhi. In that expectation I was not singular.. It was shared by those beet able by receipt of accurate information to raflect the opinions of parties nearer to the scene of action than we are here. But there soon appeared reason to believe, that we had been too sanguine in assigning so early a date for the fall of the rebel stronghold; and for many. days now I 'have been prepared to repeat the old story, that by our latest accounta Delg still holds out against us. The reinforcements, indeed, of which I spoke in my last have reached our camp-one wing of the 8th (King's), one of the 61st, a company of Foot Artillery, Major Olphert'a troop of Horse Artilery, and two guns of a native troop, the 17th Irregular Cavalry (escortig a large ammunition train), thel 2d1 Panjab Cavalry, the 1st Pnnjab Infantry, and the 4th Sikh Infantry; but the native portion of the troops thus added to the besieging force are not entirely and uniformly trustworthy, 'brigaded though they are with Europeans. The Sikhs and indigenous Punjabees, indeed, one may venture, even in these days of delusion and disaffection, to pronounce true as steel. They are doing excellent service, showing themselves on aU occasions zealous and eager to encounter the Sepoys, towards whom they entertain a national feeling. of animosity, which has been stimulated by a report, true or false, that the mutineers have murdered all people of Sikh extraction that have fallen into their hands. Even with the Ghoorkas of the Sirmoor Battalion, who Ifightmagnificently,' or the Guide Corps, which 'is the admiration of every one,' (I quote private letters from the camp,) these excellent soldiers will hardly lose by comparison. But the cavalry regiments of the Panjab force contain many Mussulmans and high-caste flindoos, from Hindostan Proper and RohilIcind, while the Bengal Irregular Cavalry regiments are mainly composed of such elements. These men arel as a class utterly disloyal, and their presence with the force in any numbers must be embarrassing. And so it has proved. In the 2d Punjab Cavalry it has been found necessary to disarm some 70 Bindostan men and to hang three, one a superior native officer. The 17th Irregulars have not, so far as we have heard, behaved amiss yet, but of the 9th Irregulars, which have been some time with the force, several troopers have deserted, and the 4th Irregulars have, I believe, murdered their adjutant, while on detachment duty. Still the strength of the army is respectable, no doubt. There are now three infantry brigades, each about 2,000strong, commanded by Colonels Showers of the Company's army, Longfield of the 8th, and Jones of the 61st (the senior Lieutenant-Colonel of the 8th). Hartley, after bringing the wing of his regiment to Delhi, went to Umballa, to fill the post of Brigadier, vacant by the death of Colonel Halifax (from cholera), The cavalry and artillery are also in considerable strength, the field branch of the latter arm especially. But it has not been considered prudent to hazard an assault upon the place; for, although an attack would probably be successful,-although, that is to say, an entrance would be, with whatever loss, effected by escalade, still the difficlaties attendant upon the complete subjugatluLL and oWaup.oU t o. oi4.y Ytiin miles in circumference, containing 150,000 inhabitants mainly hostile to the assailants, and large numbers of armed and disciplined mutineers, are not lightly to be encountered. Let us for the present be content to know that our little force holds in check the great body of the mutineers of the Bengal army; that it wil shortly receive further reinforcements of English and Sikh troops from the Punjab; that the enemy, though largely augmented in numbers, have never yet shown themselves outside the walls without being repulsed with heavy loss; that there are internal dissensions among them, and that they must be suffering severely, not only from our shot and shell, but from fever and cholera, while our camp is comparatively healthy. When the not far-off day of final reckoning arrives God will defend the right. I may appear, perhaps, unduly vehement and vindictive. I endeavour to write temperately, but I assure you it is no easy matter to preserve a uniform tone of unimpassioned narrative when oppressed bythe recollection of the hundredtreacheries, murders, and horrors unutterable that have been perpetrated by the rebels since the Meerut outbreak on the 10th of May. " In my last I brought down the journal of the Eiege to the 27th of June, when the mutineers made their first appearance outside the city, aEter the severe handling they met with on the 23d. The fighting on tbis day, thoug'a lasting some hours, was confined to the outposts, and ceased towards the afternoon, when a heavy fall of rain, the first of the season, occurred. The two following days were quiet, but on the 30th the enemy showed themselves in force among the enclosures on our right, and gave ournpickets and supports a long morning's work, in the course of which we lost a promising young officer, Lieutenant Yorke, of the late 3d Native Infantry. On the next day, the 1st of July, there was observed from the English lines on the 2idge a large encampment on the further side of the Jumna, and opposite to Delhi. It was the whole body ef the Rohilcund mutineers from the three stations of Bareilly, Moradabad, and Shahjehanpore, four regiments of infantry, one of irregular cavalry, and a battery Of artillery. For a time it'had been hoped, as I wrote a fortnight ago, that they would find the Ganges impassable, but the anticipated rise of the river did not take place-it was crossed at Gurmukteser, the usual place of passage, the Doab was traversed, and Delhi was attained. For two whole days our troops had the mortification of watching the long train of men, guns, horses, and beasts of burden of all kinds (for there was a large treasure with the rebels-say five lacs, 50,0001., atanaverage estimate) streaming across the bridge of beats into the city, without the posuibility of preventing or in any way annoying them. An immediate attack on the paet of the reinforcements was anticipated, from the known practice of the insurgents in regard to now arrivals. Aceordingly, on the afternoon of the 3d they came out in force, and threatened the right rear of the English position. But, finding our men well prepared, they ddrew off and marched away e'veralmiles to our rear along the Kurnaul roadas far as AlUpore, the plac where our army bivouaoked the night before the advance upon Delhi and the first brush with the enemy. They thought, it is supposed, to meet and capture a urain of supplie6 and treasure that was under oonvoy to the eamp. But in this espectation they wrere diuappointed, and on the folloting Inorng (the 4th) were returning to ;the c1ty wvhey they1 wQlttokd by a, body 9.]; 1,000 infantry, 19 gtn* and two squacL'fns °1 cavalry that had been s«t out to intercept theo Ihey contrived, however, to effect their retreat with little oe no loss, and saved all their gans. On the 6th the English army lost a second Commasnder-in-Ohief. i After a very few hours' illnesr, Sir Henry Birnard i died of chulera. He is suoceeded by bfjor-Gene4ral Reed, bat that offlcer is in feeble health, and, may in aU likelihoDd b3 compelled to relinquish tbecomn1mand. On the 8th a party was sent from th6eamp to destroy a bridge over the canal at the villsa of Bussy, some six miles from the city, and performxd the work effoctuaUyl, closing up one, perhaps the principal, of the avenues by which the mutimieers received supplies. On the 9th the night rear of our position, the favourite plae6, was again attacked, but with the never-failiag resuX On this occasion the loss of the assailants is estimated in the official accounts telegraphed Lahore% and those made public, as high as nearly 1,000 killed. Hence, perhaps, the quiet of the four succeeding days, for up to the evening of the 13th, the date of the latest news that we have received, no further sortie had taken place, and the suatained fire from our batteries was the only incident of the siege. Supplies reach the camp in abandance, and the men coatinue healthy, in spite of the great heat they have undergone. Changes of note have taken place among the principal officers. MajorGeneral Hewitt, who commanded at MIeerut when the mutiny broke out, has been removed from divisional oommand and has gone on leave to the hills, as also has the late Brigadier of Delhl, Colonel Graves. Major Laughton has been replaced in command of the Engineers by Colonel Baird Smith, an officer of high reputation. I need not remind you that the Adjutant-General is Brig&dier Chamberlain, of the Punjab. "I Before leaving Delhi for other parts of the disturbed districts I must copy a paper which I have received, with the assurance of excellent authority that it is a correct translation of the proclamation issued at Delhi. Thus runs the lying and insolent appeal:- "I' TO HNwDoos AND MUSSr.MANS, CnTuENiS AND SERvATs oF HINDOSTAN, TEE OFFIOXuS OF TIIE AuBv Now AT DELux AND MEERUTr SED GBvEErrNG. " It is well known that in these days all the English have entertained these evil designs-first, to destroy the religion of the whole Hindostani army, and then to make the people Christians by compulsion. Therefore we, solely on account of our religion, have combined with the people, and have not spared alive one infidel, and have re-established the DeUli dynasty on these terms, and thus act in obedience to orders and receive double pay. Hundreds of gums and a large amount of treasure have faUen into our hands; therefore it is fitting that whoever of the soldiers and people dislike turning Christians should unite with one heart and act courageously, not leaving the seed of these infidels remaining. For any quantity of supplies delivered to the army the owners are to take the receipt of the officers; and they will receive double payment fromthe Imperial Government. Whoever shaU in these times exhibit cowardice, or credulously believe the promises of those imDostors the English, shal very shortly be put to shamae for such a deed; and, rubbing the hands of sorrow, shaU receive for their fidelity the reward the ruler of Lucknow got. It is further necessarythat all Hindoos and Mussulmans unitein this struggle, and, following the instructions of some respectable people, keep themselves secure, so that good order may be maintained, the poorer classes kept contented, and they themselves be exalted to rank and dignity; also, that all, so far as it is possible, copy this proclamation, and despatch it everywhere, that aU true Hindoos and Mussulmans may be alive and watchfal, and fix it in some conspicuous place (but prudently to avoid detectioa), and strike a blow with a sword before giving circalation to it. The first pay of the soldiers of Delhi wil be 30r. per month for a trooper, andlOr. forafoot-man. Nearly lOO,000menare ready and there are 13 flags of the English regiments and about 14 standards from different parts now raised aloft for our religion, for God, and the conqueror, and it is the intention of Cawnpore to root out this seed of the Devil. This is what we of the army here wish.' " This precious document has not appeared here iu print, nor would it be prudent at present to make it generaUy known. There can, however, be nu harra in sending it to you. I need nub atop to criticize it in detall, but I may remark on the allusion to the impending outbreak at Cawnpore as proof of organization and concert on the part of the mutineers. And now, with the mention of Cawnpore, I am brought to the narration of one of the saddest episodes of this rebellion. The condition of the military division of which that station is, or rather was, the head-quarters, was, as far I knew when r closed my last letter, shortly as follo ws:-The troops of every station, save Nagode, where the 50th Native Infantry were, and, I believe, stiU are, to all appearance, firm, had mutinied. But at AUahabad the fort and its occupants had been saved by the timely arrival of Colonel Neill, and tlhe admirable use he made of his own Madras Fauileers, and of the Sikh Regiment of Ferozepore, under Lieutenant Brasyer, who has received promotion for his services. The mutinous 6th Native Infantry, whose treachery to their otacers appears to have been of the most refined description, were thoroughly broken and driven out of the station. At Cawnpore Sir Hugh Wheeler had fortified a barrack in the best way he could with his small means, and would be-able, we hoped, to hold out till relieved by the force rapidly advancing from AUlahabad, distant only 124 miles. Unhappily this hope has not been realized. Loth as we have been to believe its and greedily as we have fastened upon any little circumstance that might seem to discredit it, we are no longer able to doubt the correctness of the report that Sir Hugh, and aU who were with him, have perished. The leader of the rebels in this quarter was Nena Sahib, of Bithoor. It may be as well to give you something of the history of this man, the most thoroughly and most deservedly detested of aU who have taken part against us in the insurrection. Forty years ago, when Bajee Rao, the last Peishwa or Sovereign of Poonah, was overthrown, and his dom;nions annexed to the British presidency of Bombay a retreat was marked out for him at Bithoor, on the Ganges, 12 miles from Cawnpore. There, far removed from al Mahratta associations, but freb to indulge his reliious aspirations in the proximity of holy cities and the society of kindred Brahmins, he passed the remainder of his life itisplendid ease, receiving a magnificent income fro- the Govern- ment, which had been driven, by his owi faithlessness, to dethrone him. Childless himself, he adopted, after the Hindoo fashion, the son of a man obscure in position, but of his own nation and caste, a Mahratta Brahmin, and requested the British Government to recognize the adoption, with its consequences as to succession. The request was refused, and when the ola mar died, in 1851, his life estate lapsed to the Govern. ment. The adopted son continued to reside -at Bithoor in the possession of considerable,- weagth, (derived, I suppose, from the Peishwa's savirfgs ) and was known as Nena Sahib of Bithoor. D)oubtless he did not allow the recoUection of his-stpposed wrongs to slumber. It seems highly. probabla, that he was implicated from the first in tb. itntiny of the Cawnpore garrison; it is certaiP at least that' he placed himself at the head of te mjtiVeeis, and drew to him the disaffected froi,- all the neighbouring districts. He was first brou-,ht promlinentlyinto notice inconnexionwithlth 'faiti who, according to a s .f,ugitives from Fatteygh'ur, 'probably orly toca ..ry never yet contradicted, ani true, were captured by him whilo dropping dow-.l thle GEanges in beats;' dragged asb4oro, and butel'-r~ged 4m aTbl b ored upon the parade-ground et qzwnipore. k mentjog in my last lett T., days liter, calne the' terriole n *'that I engud ¢conmaudib.g the adgao.os lf.Ivdout 'eil- Fusileers, had 'eived 1d.m m: from spie'stboni he had sent forward to' Ofu ore thA S.irflugh Wheeler hZad. bee. mortall w6gn ^an attack mad upons him 'by thtf rebela;tht the am- jV,-lVi destitute of flod and of a.-n*unitioh; aujt "aii bbtindperission from Nena,.hib k-eminblc -in boats for Alaliabid with 4hoir tremur.so surrendering the barr aud Atofir , thbt 4hey ernbzkai ic6rdiIglj' -but 'hid; hmrdlyj;puAled off then sr wa WM 6,pened: up6nhem,ftndet whlch"g ^psaed,'withthe exceji' t Of theoocupan-s oto fb6ot, wl foH thii time esWped, but wreo evetally oen, brought, bask, Tand maxAsac,ed. -Thi 'I wAs robably on one of the LaUtdiytdof'June, -* 'h , imud'a m rt t& tohio 'coinmAndliig officer be iug *datad the 4th' of Jd17.

A Company of RoYal Artillery, under Captain Maude, broug4t up-from Ceylon, and a few Irregular Cavalry, was preparing :to eficamp abbut four fhiles from Fattehporej when &'ena Sahib moved out and attacked it. Tired- as his troops were, the General could not refuse the combat, and bad the satisfaction of driving the3 enemy before him into, through, and out of the streets and enclosures of the town, and-capturing 31tguns, without the los of a single European, a result which he ascribes to the splendid pragticeo f the artillery and. the fire from the Enfieldriflesof the infantry. He moved on towards Cawnpore as soon as his men were restod, twice again met-and routed the thousands of the enemy, captursd 16 more gu,ns, drove Nena Satib back a fugitive to Bithoor, and reoccupied Ca'onpore. There our inteligence -for the present leaves him. "EHinext objectwould probablybeto relieveLucknow, for that capital was stiU holding out. But I grieve to relate that the master-spirit which planped and maintaine& the defenoes of the place was na longer there to cheer the wavering, to awe the dieaffected,andto impartadditionalvigourtothe vigorQus. Sir Eenry Lawrence, an admirable offlcer and noble man, received ar wound in a skirmish on the 24, of which he died on the 4th. More regarding his end is not yet known. It was at first reported that -the fatal shot was fired by one of the native troops irho still remained by him. This is noW contradicted, though it is admitted that, on some day previous to the 2d, the native battery of artillery turned their gans upon him. *Bat theL regret for him is deep and universal throughout India, and thus does one and the samne Mail convey to England intelligence of the death in the field, by disease or by the sword, of three generals of diiaioa and Knights Commanders of the. Bath. As.for the remaining stations of the lateOudse (ontingent, foe so it maybe called, the list of victims cannot ygt b3 correctly ascertained, When completed it Wil ba sadly large. Very many have escaped, however, to secure station; aftermost perilousjourneys; but, as I am credibly inforRed,- more tha,one woman, while sailing down the Ganges, threw her. self into the river, preferring the calamity of deathl to the chance of 4falling alive into thehands d th mutineers. "The General will march to relleve Agra. There a gallant action has been fopght, 'which can hardly be called a victory, .ud yet of which the moral effect hal, I think-, beeaconsiderable. The mutineers -rom' Nee6IUhe: had long been known to be marching upon that ity; on the 4th of this month they were underst^d ta be within a few miles of the ceantonmernta. The Kotah Contingent (140 horse, 350 foot, aud 2 guas) was first ordered out to meet themi probably that it rightbe got ridof,for there were great donubls asto its fidellty,doubts which were jutified.byitsgoingoverta the rebelsemn msse,asoongAthey cameinsight. That afternoon every European in the station, except the troops and some of the militia, moved intO the fort. The enemy, 10,000 strong, with eight gnun, en. camped four miles from the city, on the road to Futtoypore Sikri. There they were attacked the next day by a force from the fort, consisDng of about half the 3d Europeans, Captain D'Oyly'x battery, and the horse and foot-militi. A4 deVperate action ensued, which lasted for three hourg. Tha enemy fell back under the fire of our artillery, and occupied a village in their rear, whigh was gdllantlyi carried under a galling fire bythe 3d EurQpeanr,,whilI their guns were silenced by ours, but tot till C#ptainr D'Oyly had recei'ved a mortal wound. IThere;being no cavalry, however, to' follow' up-the succeW, and ammunition failing, the little force was obliged to retreat, and did to in an orderly manner, *ough under fire of the enemy. The, fort -was'rqached. shortly before duAk. Of about. 500 ien. engaged, 49 were killed .or mortally wolndedi rnid 92 wounded less seriously, making a' tptal of J41, a convincing proof of the severity of the action. -The mutineers entered the deserted 9antoqnmenes and utterly destroyedthem.

I0OVDORV, MONDAY, AUGU32T 31, 17. The copious and lucid correspordenee from India -which we have now published will at length enable our readers to form a correct appreciation of those transactions which have been reported in such dinjointed and fagmentary shapes during the lst f?w dap. That the intelligeace is cheering is more than we can say, for it details deeds of infamy which will set the blood of every Englishman boiling- in his veins; but the ascendancy, of our arms before Delbi has been decisively maintained, and one of the two. episodes which commuinicatWd' so painful an interest to the contents of this mail acquires a mruch less afflicting complexion now-that the truth is known. What, too, is above all thiugs satisfactory-we can still announce the unshaken loyalty of the Madras and Bombay Armies. There is nothing which need inspire the slightest alarm in the runmours of a disturbance it HY4ekabad or of suspectea' lots at Poonah. The former of these cities is one of the strongholds of the Mussulman population, and the meat of a Mahomedan Court bearing a marked resemblance to that recently ejected fromLucknow. That a "rising," t'herefore, should be attempted at Hyderabadwas as probable as that there should-be an insurrection in Oude, but here the analogy between the two cases happily terminates; for, whereas in the Bengal Province the army mutinied and deprived the Government of support, in the Madras territory it acted promptly and faithfully in the restoration of order. The incident, in fact, is encouraging, as showing that, even where Mahomedan intrigues may be at work to foment rebellion, the troops of the Presidency can be relied upon to crush the revolt in the bud. It is to the operation of similar devices that we .may trace the mutterings of conspiracy at Poonah. The suspecied traitor is neither a nativg officer nor a native landowner, but the high priest of the Mus'sulman community in that city, and the authorities were on the track of the treason, alert and prepared. It is in the Bengal Presidency alone that mutiny and murder are stiU rampant, and even in this territory we can except the province of Lower Bengal at one extremity and that of the Punjab at the other. In the latter district the revolt of a couple of regiments had been summarily punished by the brilliant operations of Brigadier NicaomSomN, who, with a flying column of infantry, had caught, beaten, and scattered themutineers. The scene of Asiatic villainy and British endurance is still confined to the North Western Provinces, where the four great cities of Delhi, Agra, Luckutow, and Cawupore supply so many centres of interest to thousands of British hearts. That the regular assault upon Delhi should have been still deferred will create no astonishment, and, indeed, no regret, when it is considered that the comparatively small army which would be thus plunged into the labyrinths of a populous city constitutes the ohief force on which, until the arrival of succours, the ascendancy of the British Government mutt depend. It is encouraging, however, to learn that in every single instance the sorties of the swarming desperadoes from t'ne city have been fiercely repulsed; that the British Camp is healthy and well supplied; that our Ghoorka and Punjab auxiliaries conduct themselves with admirable -fidelity and valour, and that the hour cannot be long retarded in which deeds of unspeakable horror shaU be matched by a retribution as fearful and as stern. At Agra events have taken place which, as at I first reported, though scarcely intelligible, appeared sadly distressing, but, although there is much loss of life to be mourned, and perhaps mistakes of military judgment to be deplored, death was encountered in the open field with unconquerable heroism and no unimportant success. The mutinies in Central India-a name applied to the South-western district3 of the Bengal Prewidency-had set loose the traitorous garrisons of Neemuch and Nusseerabad, who appear to have marched upon the road connecting Agra and Delhi. At Futteypore Sikri-a small village in the vicinity of Bhurtpore, and about four =r-iles distant from Agra, on the Nusseerabad roadthey encamped to the number of 10,000 men with eight guns. It seems probable that their design was to invest and capture the fort of Agra, -in 'which the Europeans of the district had taken refuge, and there re-enact the frightful tragedies which but a few days before had been performed at Cawnpore. The garrison of the fort, however, which had been for some time in expectation of their visit, determined to anticipate the assault, and sallied forth in a body, mustering, even with civilians included, less than 1,000 strong, to attack the mutineers in their position. This daring scheme they carried intrepidly into execution, and succeeded in forcing the enemy out of the village at the point of the bayonet; but, as their ammunition failed, and as their ranks had become exposed to a. most destructive fire from the artillery of the rebels, they were compelled to retire. Their retreat, however, was effected in perfect order, and, though their losses were heavy and their success thus imperfect, the exploit was regarded in India as something like a victory, while it at least deterred the insurgents from their purpose against the fort, and left them to be drained off by the gravitation of crime into the great sink of murder at Delhi. The atrocities committed at Cawnpore exceed in magnitude anything hitherto reported from these scenes of wickedness. At this city, in a protected space which could hardly be caUed a fort, a small body of European troops, with many women and children, including, it is thought, some of the families of the 32d Regiment, had taken refuge under the orders of Sir HuGa WHEELEn, and were waiting in all the agonies of privation the approach of relief. The spacious plain outside swarmed with a mass of rebel soldiery and savage marauders, under the command of a man named NENA SAIIB. This miscreant, who until the outbreak had tived in the moBt friendly intimacy with the British officers who were so soon to become his victims, professed to consider himself iltreated by the British Government, and the circumnstances are peculiarly illustratiye of the nature of the "wrongs" alleged by such people, and countenanced by a faction at hotne. Years ago - the Peishwa of the Mahrittas, BAJEE RAo, after losing his throne in battle against us, was allowed to retire upon a princely pension, which he actually enjoyed for some 30 years. Before his death he proposed to nominate this NsA SAmB-a person in no manner related to him-as a man who should receive from -the British Government a continuation of the income conceded to himself. The very reasonable refusal of this request conatitutep the wrongs of NaNA SAne at our hands.- It must be understood that he was allowed not only to inherit without interference the private hoards of Bt sEu RAo, but also to maintain a certain armed force, and with these qualifications he was not unnatu-; rally raised, when the hour of treason arrivedj to the command of all the thieves and murderers of the vicinity. Sir HUGH WUEELE8, having been mortally wounded in the conflicts which occurred, and the horrors of starvation being imnminent, the famished garrison capitulated, on - the condition that they might be allowed to drop | down thb river to Allahabad. No sooner had they got into their boats, however, than NmrA SMAri opened a fire upon them from the banks, and -shot down every man, woman, and child within lia reach. As far as regards, indeed, the scope and intent of his butchery, there would not be a single soul remaining of those unhappy crews; but thereis some reason, we trust, to hope that in this, ap in similar cases, the massacre may have been- less complete than the assassina intended, anda tat some of the fugitives may reappear in safety.. Of the other deeds done by this maaand.hizfstloIi-w will apeak only to observe, that if the feelings of this natiof )eE%aM any matioual chartcter , not * wish iy ~a-~'ebeen cdzib~ved 5yhusband or fathe'r in his moment of unutterab!eaoylIcltfZ vengeance of his cotmtiemen will not amply realize.. *Already, indeed, the 'van of the avenging kost has app*ared. Two thousaid British bayoneta-- :the Sfirt w:ve of that' appioahiung tide which"it s roll over these dek:oted plains-have at length flashed, in tha faceof the mrerer, ai SAnr wFithis Q99W21Y crew of WAR jA been driv6r. headloig into Slight. Confiding apparently in tlhe strength of his force, he actually marched soathwards to encounter the column. of reinforeements ascending the valley of the Ganngel, met it at Futteypore, a second town of that nanme on the road to Allahabad, and, in the twinkling of an eye, w&s routed, pursued, caught again at OCawopoj, ,Ariven out of the town, and pushed into his intrsnched camp at iBithoor, where, at the lat dates, Gmeneral Thvat ocx was preparing to at.tack him. That these victorious operations may have relieved the garrison of Lucknow-only 53 miles dii4ant-from the perils which have environed them we most devoutly trust; and then, as Agra has shown its capacity to defend itself, as Cawnpore--tough too Iate, alas I for the safety of its inmates-has been retaken, and as even the mass of mutinpers at Delhi has proved itself unable to make any ismpression on our position before the city, we hope We mayrely ;with sotae confidence, not only upor the ascendancy, never yet shaken, of our arms in the field, but upon the security of our beleaguered countrymen until effective succour -arrives.
The barbaritips of the mutineers in India are so shocking, so atocious, they almost anmount to an argument that religion is not merely a pretext for this Indian Mutiay. When men astonish you with their wickedness, when they are worse than the very worst that yoa expected, when malignity surpasses itself, then they lose everything human and behave like vsry demons, in nine cases out of ten in history it turns onb that they have been under the stimulus of what they choose to call religion. This may not be one of those cases, and religion may be only a pretence, and not a real feeling, in these mutineers; but it, at any rate, gives them the licmnse of an excuse for their horrible passions. There ia something quite new to English ninds in learing of the dreadful outrages committed upon ihe persons of English men and women. .We thought we were lifted above *uch a dreadful rsih, that our higher than Romm citizenship would slield us, that some Palladium would protect one cf English blood from the last indignities, even in such terrible extremitie3 as these. It seems we are mistaken. HEere are men who know us will, know our power, our superiority, our discipline, who have benefited by our kindness, who lave been actually raised far above their native raourmes by uLs, and who can yet trea' the persons of English people in this way. Our officers in Sepoy regiments may possibly not have seen enough of their men; the service may so far have a right tq complain of them; but the total absence of suspition on their part shows that they had not illtreatea their men. In every case they did not believe for a long time that it was a mutiny, so utterly unprovoked was it. This natural surprise tells its own tale. It is under such circmstances, however, that the Sepoys have not only mutinied, but have done what they have done to the bodies of English people, that they have broken the spell of inviolability that seemed to attach to an lnglishman as such, and have plunged headlong in,o this horrible abyss of cruelty. We are taken aback, as human nature must always be when it is outraged, when it meets with what is insufferable and inexpressible, and religion, we say, may have had something to do with this treatment. We are heretics in India, and therefore out of the pale of: humanity. Religion is the pride of the Brahmin, and enters into his blood ; the Mahomedan is a ferocious animal, and made so by his creed, whiich inSpireG him with a blind, vin. dictive exclusiveness, that bakes him a true demon on occasion. Old HoLxB, we see, taunts the mutineers with their " deW" (faith), which makes such scoundrels of them; he bids them " in the " name of deen" cease to plunder, and replies to the charge of deserting his ancestors with the auswer that "he does mot think rapine and the " murder of poor women and children a part of " any religimin." These are golden words from a Mahratta Rajah. But perhaps religion, after all, only aids other motives When a set of low wretches once break loose from a spell which has iong restrained them there is on ordiary principles no knowing how far they will go. They exult in their release from the tie of respect, and think they cannot hurl tie burden too far. ThLey toss it off with wild and frantic delight, and rush into the very opposite xtreme as a vent for their sense of freedom, and in order to have the pleasure of feeling what ihey can do without being punished. The more cringing and servile they were before-the more they crouched under the commanding eye which controlled them then-the more boundless is their insolence now. They revel and wallow in ths absence of respect as the greatest luxury they can enjoy, and, having once torn away the veil, rush with a voracious relish to the polution of the sanctuary. This is the extravagance of vulgar irreverence, to soil the marble surface of the temple with vilest filth, to spit in the face of Majesty, and kick the Royalty which has won such deference, in very revenge for the deference it has won. It is not, then, because our prestige is gone that these miserable men nor insult it so outrageously; no, it is because it remains in spite of them-remains in the very minds of these men themselves; it is because it is there and they cannot get rid of it that they indulge in this frantic defilement and, so far as it is possible, debasement of it. This i, in short, a fierce, selfish military mutiny, which is ruinning its own course. It does not show a spark. of that honest patriotism which national revolts often show. These soldiers know that they have crossed the Rubicon, that they can never be friends again with us, that it is a death struggle now between us and them, and they are determined, if they have the horrors, to have the luxuries of despair too. The plague is known in Eastern cities to set loose human passions ; n6body knows how long he has to live, and therefore every one plunges into excess, that he may,- at any rate; have some enjoyment of life bef6re it is taken from 1im. It is the same ill all desperate junctures, when men know thit they have set their lives upon a cast, and that they rlUust stiund the hazard of the die. It makes double and tenfold scoundrels of them. They feel them'selves released from the ordinary iules of morals, jwhieh are voted to - be, made for permanent, not for momentary,'states of things. Let the passingQ hour, if it is to end. with the next stroke of the ,c1oc' , have, at any rate, the advantage of its transiency; let . it be isolated and s4paratedt from the yoke of moral bondage which. oplress.s the regular condition of the world, and alloyed to -be one hour of perfect liberty tohumannature. This is the true idea with these soldiers, They don't know 'how short their time may be, they e we stand ouir ground, they fid they cam make io ImJression on.the population atlarge4 Aithenmeantime every hour is bringing reinforcements from Egland 1verymornig and 'every zight they 3iae that there is so much apace the less between English I troopa andIndia. The fv,ture is. full of, blackness | and horror to them, the-pent oily is their own, nd-theyy-will use it-as-they-like. Now, thenjweIhave '{he tru6 genie lHind' As -he iSloft.to niiseIf4 and withoutt ayA -yoke, coAventional.or military, ipon hini. Few people could standaiueh a trial quite perfectly, but a> Hindoi has not one piiele of moral Atamina to enable him to do so; 'Hz rcligion is a form, lis creed n piece of non; te.nse, and his conscietce- a dead letter. .
The immediato embodirnent of itei Militia Aegi ments is announced. We could have wished.urselves that it, bad been more. It is- evident that we have still our *ork to do in India, and .hat whether we -regard the-filitia asm. th, nursery. f the -Line, or as a substitute in foreign garrisonsi? r the iAne, we shall want much more a§sistnqe -from it than that'of ten regiments. . WVe must. At least keep up the full strength of the force:we send cut to India,-for which, indeed,,we have HE3 MAJESTY'S explicit pledge ; and to do that we upt be prepared for an annual home drain of 15,000 men. All accounts speak of the last embodiment of the Militia as very successful. It would, of course, be more convenient and more pleasant to be able to go quietly on in our old peaceful ways, anad keep to our ploughs and our pruning hooks; we only take to a change of instruments because we are obliged; but, as we are obliged to do so, we may as well make a virtue of necessity, aAd extract what benefit we can from the substitution. Peaow is an excellent thing, and we should be too glad to have it again to-morrow:; bbut even peace has some disadvantages, and war some advantages-even some domestic advantages. Even Peace, " with plenty " crowned," reposing i2 the midst of -wheatsheaves and surrounded by -the sounds of country life, from humtming-bees and lowing herds, and babbling brooks, and soitable' choruses of youths and maidens, has her defects. Vegetation even jn the village sphere may be carried too far. What lazy, lounging, loose, low habits village boys acquire simply from the total absence of discipline andledrrection-from uothavinganyone to look after theml That whole system of rebuke, caustic remarks, and disciplinarian sarcasm to which the upper classes are subjected in the early stages of life never touches them. They are never made to feel ctiticism,-the sort of correction they get in their working life is a missile at their heads, or a sudden kick, or a violent cuff, which prostrates them in a moment in the dust,-all the explosions of simple rage armed with bodily strength, not the grave strokes .of authority, and therefore very defective as correctives. Put one of these boys under militay training, subject him to dril, and even bodily exercise will have its effect upon him; for body and mind samjathize, and one who has learnt to carry himself decently has learnt the first lesson of self-respect. But, what is more important still to our young clod, he Is obliged to acknowledge and bend to a legitimate authority. For the first time in his life he finds he has a real master. But the discovery does not cow him; on the contrary, it gives him real spirit,-he is proud of the master and proud of the service. Ete finds himself, from obedience to enforced rules of cleanliness, becoming himself more fastidious, ih the matter of personal cleanliness than he was; and all these changes combined, and cemented. by the finshing sentiment of the espri de c07ps, make a different man of him altogether. Something might be said also of the improvement of officers as wel as men. A young squire's life is the beau ideal of a particular type of happiness. We will not talk about a Mahomedan paradise-a phrase which a too hasty admirer in the press has applied to the Episcopal Palace at (luddesdon, but a hunting and shooting prophet would undoubtedly select for his state of happiness a mode of life not very unlike our young squite's. What could he have more? There is fresh air and othing to do, freedom, jollity, port, companionhip, endlks3 sport, every blessing connedted with every one of the elements. But even this human paradise has the canker of human imperfection. It is too privileged a life. The young squire hat an immunity from every task imposed on mortal man, but we do not know that he is always the happier man for it. It will be a reliif to him in many case-and, whether a relief or not, a very good thing for him-to give hixii something to do, to introduce him to the duties of a rogimental officer, which will impose some need for attention, patience, and punctuality upon him,-which will, perhaps, bring as their result some foreign residence, which will give him a field for experience and observation, and enlarge his mind more than the paternal estate, or even a hurried six weeks' run upon the Continent would do. We repeat, that the last embodiment of the :Nflitia in the Russian War was, from aU we hear, a successful work, and produced a good deal of that kind of improvement we have been describing; and we see no reason why the new embodiment of the Mlitia just announced should not be as successful. The time is past now when mrothers of village boys came with apron up to eye and voice suffocated by sobs, to announce to the parson of the parish that " Tom had 'listed," as if it were a piece of intelligence exactly the same in character as that of Tom being transported, and as if a deadly blow were given thereby to the honour and respectability of the family. The time has gone by when it was thought that nobody but the veriest scapegrace could think of fighting for his coun'ry -when a cockade was regarded with horror by the respectable poor, and the trade of a soldier classed with that of gambler, cockfighter, and bully. The improvements in the service have told upon the poorer classes, and theyl now see that a soldier makes at least as good; a husband, son, and brother as any other man; that he is at least as decent, respectful, and civil as the mass of country fellows are, and that he does net drink or swear more. We look forwkrd with confidence, then, to the recruiting we shall have now going on for, perhaps, several years to come. The resolution of the C-overmment to maintain our Indian Empire is the resolutlpn of tbe nation. Lord PArEnsrox never spoke more truly than when he described the strong point of aI representative constitution in regard to f4reign enemies as being the way in which the peopld rally. round the Government in time of war. That, gives. a force to our rins which no despotism. can! give; Let the Minister rely upon this tr'uth,; trust his own observation, and look to the countiydfor a safe, sure, and loyal response to any qfforts, however large or costly, which may be necessary: for tha reduction, of this Mutiny.

SECOND EDITION* 2'HE TIMBS OFICB M"&dy Moming. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the' letter of our Paris oorrespondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p.m.- The latest telegraphio despatch from Condantlnople, dated yesterday, does not announoe the resumption of diplomatic relations betwoen the Porte and the four Powers. All that wag waited for was the complete constitution of the new MIinistry. M; de Thouvenel has had an audience of the Sultan. Despatohes from the French Consul at Tunis announce that the Bey has granted the full saifaction demanded of him for the recent outrages on Euro peans They add that his Government is so weak that similar exessses may be expected to occur again, and that it is essential to take measures for the future protection of foreigners. The D1bats contains a budget of mniscellaneou, intelligenoe from Senegal and the French Weet India Islands. In Upper Senegal the Mohammedan chief, El Hadj Omar, after having been twice re. pulsed in fierce attacks on the fort of Medine, had announced his intention of taking It by famine. le had also proclaimed throughout Senegwnbia and Guinea that, when he should have finished with Senegal, he would 7attack Gambia, Gore, and all the establishments on the west coast of Afica, whence he was resolved to expel the Europeans. Meanwhile he has been detained two months by a fort of no great strength, into which, notwithstanding the blockade, supplies have been thrown, and whitber relief was sent in July. From ,Guadaloupe we learn that the firat cargo of African labourers had arrived bv the ship Phcenix. She left the coast of Africa with. 296 on board, and lost 14 on the passage, which lasted 39 days. The Administration of Guadaloupe had been informed by the Minister of Marine that " two ships, belonging to the house of Regis, the Stella and the Clas, were about to quit Marseilles to recruit, on the West Coast of Africa, the 1,200 or 1,500 emigrants that house had undertaken to supply in the course of 1857." The Duke of Rivas had a long interview on Friday with,Count Walewski, and is said to have declared that, before proeseing to hostilities with Mexico, the Spanish Government would publish a manifesto, explaining the question at issue, and permitting the Mexican Government to open fresh negotiations. Although accounts are conflicting with respect to the exact course the Spanish-Mexican dizpute is taking, and to the manner in which it is likely to be arranged, it is pretty evident,that all danger of collision between the two Powers Is over for the present. As regards the final settlement, that, considering the national character of the disputants, may possibly be long. But fears for Cuba wil restrain Spain from carrying out those warlike threats of] which her pre3s and some of her legislators were lately lavish. The name given to the&medal granted to the sur. vivors of the old Imperial .rmies excites, as might be expected, some comment and surprise. It is certainly not generally approved. To say nothingof its recalling unfriendly souvenirs, it is thought very odd - that a French decoration should receive the name of an English possession. The denomination originally proposed by the MTinister of War, and approved by the Emperor was. The Medal of the Old Army.', It was quite unexpectedly that the Mfoniteur an- nounced that it was to be called the Medal of St. Helena. I am assured that the number of claimants for it will be far larger than might be expected. 3But the shortest peliod of service in the Imnperial armies suffices to entitle to it, and it must be remembered with what mere boys the first Napoleon was at last driven to recruit his legions. In a recent Council of Ministers, M. Abbastucci expressed himself in ternr of great indignation with respect to the abuses in Algeria that have been revealed on the] trial of Captain Doineau and the Arab culprits. Marshal Vaillant, in reply, endeavoured to extenuate the matter, observing that, in judging it, we must not look at it exactly from the European point of view, but make some allowance for the peculiar ieumstances of a recently conquered country, for the character of the people to be dealt witb, &c. A mixed Commisdon has been appointed to draw up a plan, to be submitted -to the Emperor, for the reorganization of the Arab bureaux. It seems to be considered impossible to dispense with them, but a less military character will probably be given to them. It is still reported that aenerals Montauban and Beaufort will be re-moved from their present commands in consequence of the scandal this affair has occaaioned. A great reorganization of the Ministry of the Interior is taliced of-into five branches or divisions, -Public Safety, the Press, Accounts, General and *Departmental Administration, and Telegraph. A newspaper said the other day that Paris was left without a Parisian. It is no exaggeration to say that it is left without a single inhabitant who ean possibly escape from it Summnyer, suspended for a few days, has returned to us as vigorous as if It were its frst appearance this year. Hot though it be, people dare not complain of such glorious -weather, especially as the knowing ones prognosti4ate a vintage of such quality as has not been known since the year of the great comet; but they glaly fly from heated asphalte to sea baths and fresh pustures. Dieppe and Trouville, Vichy and Biarritz, overflow, while hero the throng upon the Boulevards has lost its lustre, scarcely an equipage is to be seen in the Bois de Boulogne, and in vain the Pr6 Catalan throws wide its porals, lights up its 100,000 lantern, arrays its dancers on rural stages, and illuminates the department with itk.blun lights and rocketa. Paris is gone abroad, and the foreignerreigna undisputed mastsrodtherterritory. It is a complete invawion, customary at thisseason, chiefly of birds of pasage, who often come for only a day, but manage to pas a week, much to the comfort of the hotels and restaewraturs. Great Britain is strongly represented here, especially by healthylooking gentlemen in capacious waistcoat, who seem to pass most of their time in instituting practical comparisons betweenVery%s, the Trois Frbres, and other renowned taverns, and rose patriotic comment usually is that, after all, you get nothing so good here as in London. But it would be hard if men who pay so well, and enjoy such good appetites and such constant thirst, should not be allowed to grumble while consuming the best of everything, and so the Parians shrug their shoulders indulgently at John Bull-s eccentricities while pocketing all the coin they can seduce him' Into parting with. The theatres are dull, as well they may be in August; a French Version of Jack -e?ard is successful at the Porte St. Martin, its chief attraction appearing to be a very correct aoenic imitation of the fog in whi&h Londoxjis bupposed to be continually enveloped; some amusing improprieties are played to empty benches at the PalaJz Royal; the Grand Opera, balletes, we va que d'ne janbe; at the Italian Theatre an actor naned Salvini is magnified by some of the criticx into a star of Ristori's magnitude; but there is dibmunce of opinion on tbis head.

Xlng Perdinand of Nlaple has granted nAumerous deco. ration,, lneds, and pensions to the authorities and Urban Gusds of Calbria. The intendaut of Serno hws been nmmed Grand Cross." The lancers of the Imperial Guard leave Paris to-morrow for the camp at hO.lons. Their arrival will complote the body of troops to be asewmbled there. It was found that there was a deficiency of water in the camp, and a piece of land was added to it which contains springs. It is said thai next year 80,000 meV. ill mustwr at Chilons. Prince Napoleon, Who is accompanied by the Sardinlan Minister, M. Villamarina, is expected back in Paris on Wednesday before proceeding to the Pyrenees. MarBshal lAndon, who had obtained leave from the Emperor to come to Paris, has postponed his journey until the end of September. Colonel Hartmann, of the Hanoverian service, ha3 arrived here, charged with a mission of a military nature by his Government. The berths on board the steam-packet Valetta, which sailed from Mfarsellles on Friday last, carrying the sails for India, where all engaged by the English Government for offliers proceedlng to the scene of operations In Bengal. A leter from PRochefort states that the steam cutter Pregent, of 150 horse-power, has been ordered to proceed to India, to relieve the Mlarceau, which has left for Hongkong. The French frigate Perseverante, bearing the flag of Admirl Lugeol, ww. at Tahiti on the 28th of May. Cardinal Merlot, Grand Almoner of the Emperoils household, took the oaths to the Emperor yesterday, at the Palace of the Tuileries, in the presence of M. Abbatucci, Keeper of the Seals, and Marshal Vailant, Minister of War. The Emperor left Paris yesterday for the camup at ChMons-sur-Mame. He travelled by a special train on the Strasburg Railway, and was accompanied by Generals EspinMgedeFailly, Montebello, and Fleury; Colonels Toulongeon, and LeplcCaptains Brady and Morand; Prince Joachim Murat, and his surgeon, h. Larrey. A letter from Genoa of the 27th instant informns us that the departure of the steamer Monzambono, to assist in the immeraion of the electric cable beI tween Africa and Sardinia, was fixed for the fallow|ing day. General Albert La sarmora,the Chevalier Bonelli, Deputies Coselli and Buffa, and other per. sons of distinction, propose to sai in the MIonzambono. AUSTRIA. (FROM OUR OWN CoolrPOsDzNT.) VIENNA, AUG. 27. Aomost every German paper contains an account of the approaching visit of the Emperor Alexander to Germany, but none of them have given correct information as to his intended movements. On the 15th of SeptemberHEis Majesty will arrive at Berlin, where he will only remain one day. On the 17th he will join the Empress at Darmstadt, in which city She has been staying with her relatives since the 23d inst. It is not known to me where the Emperor Napoleon ancd the Emperor Alexander will meet, but it Is a positive faot that they have agreed to do so during the month of September. As it is very posible that those persons who are inclined to suspect the sincerity of the French monarch may "smell treason," it may be as well to state that it was the Emperor Alexander, and not the Emperor Napoleon, who proposed that a meeting should take place. The good-natured Czar is probably desirous of making the amende honorabke for the public and gratuitomu insult which his deeased father offered to the parvenu who rules over the French by the grace of the people. The policy of the Austrian Cabinet Is sometimes so excessively refined that it far passes my understanding, and s,uch is the case just at present. Although the Imperial Cabinet cannot posbly gain anything by giving umbrage to the Emperor Napoleon, the Wiewner Zeitung of this morning contains the following notice:- "At 6 o'clock in themorning of the 27th (this day) the Duchess Regent of Parns, with her children, Duke Robert L, the Count of Bardl, and the Princesses Margaret and Alice, mre to leave Probsdorf, the residence of the Duke of Bordeaux, for Venice and Parnas During her stay at Frohsdorf Her Royal Highness completely recovered her health. DuringthesojounofthoDaehessaid her family in Vienna they were most graciouy and heartily (miU der grazidseoten herzkkOit) received by their Majesties and the other members of the Imperl Family." France and Austria have agreed on the conditions of a postal convention, but, unfortunately, it cannot be concladed until it has received the sanction of three-fourths of the States belonging to the German "Post-Urdon." The French Cabinet, which well knows, the snail-like pace at which German Governments are accustomed to move, has proposed that the Convention with Austria shall not be signed until 1860, in which year the Post-Union treaty will be at an end. Great workrs have been undertaken in the Imperial docks at Muggia, where a second ship of the line is to be built. The arsenal and new fortifications at Pola are making ragid progress, and we are told that they are on such a grand scale that they will surpass anything and everything of a similar kind in the Empire. Rasza Sander, the renowned bandit and guerilla chief, pased the night of the 5th in the fortress of Arad, and early in the morning of the following day he left with his guard for Transylvania. It is related that he has promised to point out spots where valuables were hidden during the Revo-. lution. The Verona police has discovered and arrested the persons who plundered the diligence between Verona and Innspruck, and they are not persons who belong to the lower classes of society. The Augsburg Gazette expresses its "' strong doubts " of the correctness of some of the statements contained in that letter of June 27 which the Pays pro fessedio havereceived from Delhi. On the 23d the Archduke Ferdinand MaximiUian gave the Venetians a fite in the gardenwhich ha3just been thrown open to the public. The illumination, which was at the expense of the Arohduke, is said to have been very brilliant. Their Imperial High. neaes and the Duchess of Berry supped in a tent which had been pitched in one of the side avenue3 of the garden. The Princess Cecilia of Baden was coniimed at St. Petersbuyg on the 15th inst., according to the rits of the " Orthodom Church," After she had made her profesdon of faith in the Russian language the Emperor proclaimed her a Russian GrandDuchess, with the name of Olga Feodorovna. Her marriage vwth the Grand Duke Michael will take place on the 28th inat. rTALY. (MoM OUR OWN ooalnsoDMyN;r.) TURIN, AauGr. 27. The late French diplomatic changes have naturoily given rise to mucn speculation in Italy as to their signification regarding the policy of the Imperial Government towards Italy in the future. While on the one hand the Liberal prty flatter themselves that the mnomination of the DucRle Gm|nont as repraeentative of the Emperor at the Court of Rom gives promie of the inauguration of that much-desred policy shadowed forth mu the weIl-known letter to Edgar Ney, the Armonia and its fellow labourer find consolation la the faot that even the Liberal papers are obliged to describe the appointment of th}e Duo de Gramont as Promotion, which, says the Armonia, proves that the Emperor of the French esteems the Govern. ment of Rome much more than he does that of Sardinia. A letter received from Bologna this morning says this appointment had raised great hopes among the' Iiiberal party there, and the 'wrter adds that the Pope, in taking leave of thx Austrian authorities there, had avid " he had fel comforted in seeing himself surrounded by brave men, who not only had re-established the Pontiffezl Throne, but maintained and defended courageously tho sacerdotal power against the attacks of luke. warm frienda of little faith," which was supposed to be ae allusion to the French Government, as the remark was madewshorbly afti Countde Rayneval ha1 been there to take leave of His Holiness. The Monitore Toscano of the 24th describes the fun6tion performed by the Pope, in the church o Sta. Maria del Fiore the day previous, of consecrating four new Prelates-viz., the Archbishop of Florence, and the Bishopx of VQlterra. Montepulciano, and Fiesoli-as having been attended with great pomp. The Grand Duke and Duchess, the Dowager Grand Duches, the HereditaryPrince and Princess, the Archduke Charles, and the Count anl Countess of Trapani, as well as all the Ministers of State and the Corps Diplomatique, were present unofficially and in stalls set apart for them. The Pope was seated on a mangnificent throne, erected for the occasion, and was aSsisted in the ceremony by Monsignor Franchi,Arcbbishop of Thessalonica and Papal Internuncio at the Tuscan Court, and by Monsignor Arrigoni Archbishop of Lucec. After the ceremony the l'ope retired to the apartments of the Chapter, and deigned to accept a sumptuou s breakfat there, and to admit the canons and chaplains to kiss his foot. On returning to the Pitti Palace hi i Holiness again gave his benediction to the multitude from the balcony. The next morning (24th), at half-past 9, a salvo of artillery announced the departure of the Pope for Pisa. I have good authority for saying that the Pope's reception at Florence has been very much what it was throughont his journey in his own dominions-that is to say, respectful towards himself as head of the Church, with a strongly-developed curiosity to see a live Pope. I met a friend yester. day who had witnessed the Pope's reception in several towns of the Marches and Romagna, and aiso at Modena and Florence, and he amured me the reception at Modena was the nearest approach to an enthusiastic welcome that he saw, and even there it was very tame. As to the Florentines, he said they crowded in hundreds and thousands tv look at the Pope as they would at a wild beast, bu' they paid very little attention to him once theic curiosity had been satisfied; and though the streets and open places were full of people, and the houses decorated with flags and garlands, and tapeatry and other inanimate symbols of rejoicing on the day of his arrival, few people even uncovered, and hardly any knelt to receive his benediction as he passed along. The Court and clergy at Florence had, of course, done their utmost to invest the Papal visit with the air of a triumph for their views and opinions, but although the priests undoubtedly have great influence over certai| classes, the people of Tuecany are by nature far too acute to be led by the simple dictum of preacher3 against the evidence of their own senses; and it is said this visit of the Pope to Tuscany will, therefore, probably have done more to destroy the faith in Papal infallibility than all the efforts of Protestant or Evangelical missionaries could have effected in a century. LTord and Lady Normanby passed through Turia yesterday, on their way to England. His Lordship was hastily summoned by telegraph in consequence of the serious illness of one of his brothers, and is expected to return in about six weeks. It is oxpcoLed th1,v Prriv Napoleon wil accompany IHis Majesty King Victor-Emmanuel on his return to Turin from Savoy, after inaugurating the works for the tunnel through the Mont Cenis and the railway bridge over the Rhono, which are to be the completing links of railway communication be. tween the Italian Peniusula and north-west of Europe. During his stay here his Imperial Highness will be lodged in the Royal Palace. The Parma Gazette publishes a notice from the executive committee for the railway from Piacenz x to the Sardinian frontier, to the effect that from th, first to thelast day of September there will be opened every day (except festivals), in the Chambers of Commerce of Parma andPiacenza, registers for those who may apply for shares in that undertaking. The shares are of 500f. each, and 10 per cent. of the value is to be paid at the time of making the application. At the end of the time fixed for receiving applications the Executive Council will make known without delay whether the demands have exceeded the number of shares to be distributed in the State according to the terms of the concession, and if so it will fix a day when the applicauts shall receive back their deposits and adjust their relative claims.

AMBBICA. 'lWERPOOI4 SkriUnn±V. The British and North Amaerican Royal;- miail steamship Persia, Judkins oommander, arrived in the Mersey on Saturdavr morning, with advioes from NewYork to the l9th nt. She brought$1,742,50T specie on freo'ht. On the 19th inst. the Persia passed the Royal mail steamer Arabia, hence, going into New York; .on the 20tb, at 4 45 p.m., in lat. 411, long. 68 W., passed the English screw steamer Jason, boundwest; on the23d, at3 p.m., inlat 4745, long. 50 20, signalized the Royal mail steaship 'America, hence, for Halifax and Boston; on tie 26th, in lat 52, long. 25, passed the Argentinus; and on the 28th, off Galley fead, signalized the Katinka, steering north-east. T;he steamship Borussia, from Ham~burg, and tha UJnited States' mail steamship Columbia, hence, had arived at New York. On the last outward paasage ,of the Persia a eir cumstance occurred illustrating the perfect organization which exists on board the vesels of the Cunard fleet. One afternoon a seansn wno was engaged stowing the anchor on the frecastl mised his footing and fell into the sea. The ship was steaming at full speed. " A man overboard' was shouted, a buoy was thrown to him, the engines were stopped, a boat lowrered, and ix eight minutes (by a passenger's watch) from the time the accident occurred the man was again in s3fety on the vesse's deck. Two hundred and dxty men, deserters from Walker's scattered Filibustering fcrce, had reached New York and told their taleo of suffering, which appears to have been great. They had attracted some commiseration. The latest return respecting the issourl election is contained in the following despatch from St. Louis; under date August 17:- " The official retumns from 80 eonaffts hrve been received. The reported vote of the 23 other eoumlies reduces Bllines majority to such an extent as to makp the officil returns therefrom necessary to determine the wsnlt." The New York Herald, referring to a rumour that British agents were recruiting in the States, says .- " We eee that rumour Imputes to the British officera here some attempts to enlist men for aenrle In India, and some of the smaU papers call upon the authoritles to put a stop to such breaches of the law. We don't believe that any attempts have been made to enlist trocPS for the British ser. vice here, and if there had they wouti have been brewahes of no law." Letters received at [eNw York from China] had given rise to a rumour that the United States had decided to take possession of the island of Formosa, as security for the payment by the Chinese Government of the indemnity demanded for damage done to American interest during the disturbances at Canton. A postal convention had been concluded between the United States and Hambura. The mails are to be exchanged by means of hunted States or Hamburg mail steamers, running direct between New York and Hamburg. The postage between the United States and Hamburg, under this arrangement, is 10 cents the single latter of half an ounce or under, prepayment optional, and 2 cents on newspapers, prepayment required. The rates to all eountries and places beyond Hamburg, whether upon letters or printed matter, are identically the same in all respects as the mtes charged vid Bremen under the United States' and Bremen Poetal Convention. (BY zI=ca AND 1UR UANrAzo TEWlisPG ) At New York financial afTairs continued feverish. The extensive shipments of specie and the unfavourable accounts of the London money-market had operated prejudicially. This influence had been materially aggravated by contirued demonstration of the 4'Bear" party on the Stock-Exchange. On the 18th Michigan Southern Stock experienced a decline of 7 to 9 per cent. The Comnercial and J3hipping is states that,- " Naturally enongh in going downhill Michigan dragge'l other descriptions after it. Erie, however, remained toler .ably firm in the face of the published propoeas for a new loan of $6,000,000. Reafdg also weathered the storm without serious damage. Laterin the day It was announced that Mr. Litchfield, the presidmt of the Michigan Southern, had resdgned his office, assfgnigg sa a reason for that proceeding a-want of harmony between him and the direotors, which prevented him from deuioping the resources of the road in his own way. It was rumoared that the paper of the company had been permitted to go to protest ia the course of the day, but the corcness of ths rport wo do not undertake to vouch." Business in various quarters exhibited signs of revival, and money, notwithstanding the fluctuations of stocks, remained tolerably abundant and was easily obtainable At 9 to 10 per cent. for prime endorsed paper- Call loans were 8 per cent. The Bank statement showed a decrease in aD its items; the un3rawn deposits had decreased a uttle more than$500,000., and were nearly 4,000,000below the point that they had attained at the same time last year. For the first time in two months there was a contraction in the discounts, primcipally, we presume, in the demand loans, there having been considerable calling in by the banks during the week. The exchange-maiket for the Persia Wa not largely supplied with exporters' draughts, and buyers mostly had to depend on bankers' bills. The quotation on Londlon was 9i to 94. Cotton continued to be firmly held, wlth a rising tendency ia prices. Flour had declined from about 15c. to 20c. Wheat had also declined. Spirits of turpentine a slightly improved. Pork had risen in price. Sugar continued depressad. Tobacco qutiet. No cange in iron. Freights unchanged STTPP7lNr ITNTT.T.T". The William TapRc.tt and the Ontario, hence, and the Liverpool, fron London, have arrived at New Yor~k. The Lancaster, hene, has arrived at Philadelphia; and the General Berry, from Glasgow, has arrived at Boston.
DranAsE A-D DEFoBtIUTyr Am IticAN ScHoc- -In Miss Beeeher's Letteis to the People on, Health and Hiap{iiness it is claimed *it the healthl of the American pe eis aperishing at a femnl ratio, ni d that, whle other nations, both in slhool and at home, trson their children to be strong and healthy, ve are training ours to be puny, sickly, and deformed. In proof of theis facts are exhibit showing that of the Ametican women born in this century andl country probably -hot two Ini ten have the vigour and health of their maternal ancestors, while probably more than one half of them are either invalids or very delicate. The object of this artileo is to direct plblic atern tion to the prospects of tie coming generation, as indicated by the heath of the chsidrn of our otty schools. From the recent investigations there s reason to believe that more thay one-hAlf of the children of our public schools wbo were born in this counztry, and who are 12 yeas old and upwards, are either dieased or deformed. W-ll the public look at this ? Bad sir from stoves, rooms without ventilation, cose sleeping-roons, crowded school-rooms, impropr food, poisAhotu medicines, want of proper exer- cise,and over-excitement of the bran by study have all comebined to produce a debility of the whole body, especially of the nuscles The resu.It is often shown in pale and,- sallow complexion, tho nghi fhis someatimes attends tolerable health. But the foowina w . inaices of .the debility and diseas thus induoad:-Th. first is a snking of a the intesines from want of this so on th e 'usces of th abdomen, which have become weak- and 11aby. It is the tight p iod the Intestines by these and other mauscles that sustai the spine and keep all the interior organs In place These mumaoles bccomaing weak, the wbole organism zfnl~s downward, somethimts displacing the most important Aad delicate 'organs. One symptom of this coudlUion-ii a fiat chest, another as a flatness or caving-in mear the p1tibf the stomach, witha con. sequent projecting at thelowar part of the abdomen, instead of the cuLrve outward from th9breastbone to the lowest point of the body whichi Is meen in a perfectly formed young chiLd Still another tymptom is such a weaalnes of the back and stomachi as mnskes the child alt crooked.

Thes deformities indicate the decay and. debility wrhich sooner or later bring on disease of various kinds. Teaehers in our city schools say thseo marks of weakness and deformrity are constantly increasing, and that the longer the pIupils gto wcho9l the more these indications Increase;thapt Iis to say, tlieT' are found more In the upr depart ments than in the prbafty.

The yellow fever had greatly idecreasd 'at St. Thomas'x, but there were still some case. among the shipping. M1r. Booker, fifth officer of the Clyde, *iad died from its effects. La Plats has had no sicknes throughout the voyage. Just previous to the arrival of the steamer *t St. Thomas's, and during her stay there, Dr. Schuyler, the medical officer of the ship, administared to the whole of the crew from 6 to 15 grains of quinine as a preventive. This steamer brings 100 passengers, and on freight $2,222,364 in specie (of which $1,697,777 are in silver, and $524,587 in gold), platina value $360, pearls value $250, and a cargo consiting of 169 serons of cochineal, 11 serons of jalap, 128 casas of cijars, 13S bales of tobacco, 35 casks of coffee, 111 bale of sarsaparilla, 63 bags of cocoa, 14 bales of wool, 146 bales of bark, 2 casa of tortoiseshall, 9 bales of indiarabber, 11 packages of straw hats, and 87 packages of sundries. August 19 La Plats passed the schooner Belle, of Halifax, in lat. 27 36 N., long. 57 42 W.; Augutt 20, the French ship Regulus Nantai of Mareilles, in lat. 30 40 N. ; long. t4 11 W. The United States' ship Saratoga sailed from Greytown for Colon July 30. Her Majesty's ship Tatar had sailed from Colon for Greytown. The American steamers Central America and Grenada sailed from Colon on the 3d of August for New York. Her Majesty's ship Alarm was at Panama. The Royal mail steamer Atrato arrived at St. Thomas's from Southampton, al well, Aug. 16, at 8 a.m., just as La Plata was leaving. The Clyde was at St. Thomas's, from the Windward ITland ; the Conway at St. Thomas's, refitting for the Jamaica route; the Dee at St. Thomns'N from the Gulf of Mexico; the Derwent at Barbadoes, from Trinidad, &c. ; the Eagle at Jamaica; the Solent at St. Thomas's, from the Jamaica route; the Thames on the Spanish Main; the Treat at St. Thomas's, from the Spanish Main. The news from Jamaica affords very little interest, and extends to the 11th inst. Governor Darling had received several addresses from the inhabitants, congratulating him upon his assumption of the government of the island, to which he made suitable replies in the usual way. Fevier, as usual at this season of the year, was prevalent, but there had been no fatal cases. The island wan visited with some refreshing showers, whizh will, no doubt, contribute to the increase of the ensuing crops, which bid fair to yield abundantly. Tranquillity prevailed, and trade altogether presented a rather lively appearance. De Cordova's Mercantile Inkteligencer of the 10th inst. states that great inactivity prevailed in the produce-market, excepting in the articles flour, pork, and fish. Of the former large sales had been made; 800 barrels were taken at 45s., and a sale of 1,300 barrels to arrive had been closed at the same price; but a speculator anxious to close operations had allowed a parcel of 3,000 barrels to go at 43s. In fish a little speculative feeling had been evinced, and no cargoes having arrived old fish had been less neglected. Cornmeal continued dull, and stocks large. Very little coffee at market; prices ranged from 46s. to 52s. per 1001b. Stock of rice was light; a lot of 300 bags Patna had been parceled out at 22s. per 1001b. Exchanges on London.-Government bills, 39 days, 4 per cent. pm. J amaica and Colonial Banks, 90 drays, i per cent. pm.; 60 days, 1 per cent. pmU.; 30 days, li per cent. pm.

From D)emierara the chief item of news is an outrageous attack made by a low rabble of women and boys on Governor and Mrs. Wodehouse, as they were proceeding from the Public Buildings to embark for England. A large crowd, composed of the lowest seum of the population, had assembled in front of the market, and as the Governor and Mrs. Wodehouse, accompanied by the Bishop of Guiana, Air. Walker (the Lieutenant-Governor), the Chief Justice, Hon. W. B. Wolseley, Hon. D. Macdonald, Hon. Dr. Blair, Sir W. H. Holmes, MIr. A. F. Gore, Mr. J. Brumell, Mr. E. T. E. Dalton, Mr. W. H. Ware, Mr. R. S. Turton, and several other gentlemen, were walking to the Stelling theylrerelas lted by the mob with stone3, plantain stalks, and other nussiles. We regret to say 'c}tat Mrs. Wodehouse was strucrk on the forehead vrith a stone; the Bishop received several -blowrs, the Chief-Justie was wounded in the ear, and Mr. Wolselay in the face. Several other gentlemen were struck with missiles of one kind and another. The police charged the mob and kept them back,but they took none into custody ; and, although there were several detectives among the crowd In plain clothes, they made no arrests. The couduct of the police is much complained of by the Demerara journals. Having got safely on board, his Excellency and lady took their departure, the guns of the fort saluting the Governor as the steamer passed. The outrageous conduct of the mob had caused a universal feeling of indignation throughout the city, and several public meetings of different bodies had been held, and resolutions of condemnation passed, with addresses to his ZExcellency. The cultivation of cotton in the colony had commenced in earnest. One gentleman, the proprietor of estates on the east coast, had imported a quantity of Sea Island cotton seed from Savannah, sufficient for 200 acres; and other gentlemen had also commenced to grow cotton. There had, been somne heavy showers d thunderstorms during the last fortnight. The g=rowing canes were thriving under the genial influence of alternate rain and sunshine. At present comparatively little sugar was being made, and freights were consequently scarce. The exports for the past fortnight had been : Sugar, 411 hhdv. 14 trcs. 139 bls.; rum, 277 pun. 72 bhds. 4 bls. ; foreign sugar, 18 hhds. 2 tres. molasses, 272 pun. 18 hhds. ; rice, 1,000 bags; wine, 2 quarter casks; I box arrowroot; starchand preserves, 16 cases preserved salmon, 3 bls I.sh glue. At Barbadoes the House of Assembly had met once during the fortnight, but no business of any moment was transacted. The crop prospects were good, and the weather excellent. The provision crop wu likely to yield in abundance. The iaund continued healthy.! From the other islands there is no news of any importance. Pacific advices have been anticipated.|

-A tSTRALIA. r the arrival of the overland Mail we have 2recved files of papers from Melboune to the 25th of June. The following is the letter of our Melbourne corre8pondent:_ MELBOURNE, JuNic 25. The European, with the April mail, dropped anchor Iu nEobsoixs Bay on Saturday, the 6bh inst., a little before mid. "o5t. She briDgs The Times newspapers up to the 16th of .ApriL lHaving delivered her mail bags, she sailed on Sunday for 4ydney, and as there is no other steamer belonging to the comnany either here or in Sydney, she Is appointed to return with the June mails eight days after the proper daVtof depaxture. The Columbian will bring us the May mnal1, and then we must expect another hiatus aising out of the Oneida's disafser. I nentioned in my lat that the Government had offered for-tender 187,0001. of debentures, bearing 6 per cent. in. terest. The days of payment ranged from the 1st of January, 1858, to the 1st of January, 1869. Miles, F(ington, and Cc., a mercantile house here, obtained the short date dobentuies at 1034 2s. 8d. for remittance. They will be worth at least that in the London market, and, as bank bills of exchange would ooab them 2 per cent. premium, they will reap a fair advantage from the purchase. The savings-bank purchased the next five parcels, payable 20, or 20,000., every year from 1863 to 1867, at 1051. The Govermnent retain the remainder, for which, however, there is ample demand. Melbourme Gas Company's 6 per eent. debenture-, payable 1867, have also been sold at 105., and South Australian 6 per cents, at 1041. I was informed by one of cur most intelligent gold and money brokers that there is a marked preference given to our Government debentures above all other securities, and that the shortness of the date is the only feature which limits their price. Money is very plentiful, and can be had on mortgage as tow as 7 per cent. on substantial town properties if no nore thn two-thirds of the present value be required. have already alluded to the large amount of accumulated oney capital seeking investment, and as the subject is of - eat imaportance to the mercantile interest connected with ese colonies, I must return to it. The motives t-o accnalate here are in full activity,, chiefly because all adverse .ducements are veak. In England there are numerous oans of indulgence to which the successful merchant or manufacturer is attracted, which have little or no place here. He may make an eldest son, and found a family in England, whereas here such a course would be against the habits and opinions of society. In England he may become a great book collector, or a great picture collector, or he mnay indulge in all sorts of expensive tastes, which, If they exist here, ale Latent for want of objects. Our great money makezs seem to derive their chief enjoyment from the mere pleasure of playing the game. >,o far as personal Dnjoyment and comfort are concerned, I really see little or no difference between the expenditure of 2,000b a-year and that of 5,0001. or 10,0001. a-year. If the maximum of en. joymnent be purchasable vith 2,0001. or 3,0004 a-year, those *rho make three or four times as much, having no motive to expend it, acquire the habit of accumulating from the mseze absence of all other inducement. A. B. Is a man of greatwealth, made by his own inteUigence, energy, and abtinence. His incomeis, say 20,0001. a-year. If he hled In England he would perhAps do as old Sir E. Peel did, send his son to Oxford, buy him a seat in Parliament, and give him the opportunity of making himself Prime Minister; or he might have bim higbly trained for the bar, and place the youth's foot on the first step of the ladder to the woolsack. He might also encourage the fine arts, as Mr. Vernon did, by making a large collection of the works of modern artists, and afterwards present his collection to the nation. Here, however, he trains up his son in the path he has himself trodden, places him as a olerk in a merchant's-offSce or a bank at 16 or 17 years of age, and hopes the Eon will follow in his own foot. steps. The indueaments to accumulate will be weakened most likely in the son's time bv the strengthening of the inducements in favour of other and higher enjoyments; but at present the former greatly outweigh in strength the latter. There is a marked difference between Tasmania and Victozia, which has some effects in favouring the accumulation of money capital here. The practice of selling land in place of granting it was adopted in 1831, by what are known as Lord Rlpon's regulations. This was shortly after the publication of Edward C-ibbon Wakefield's letter from Sydney, containing his plan for selling land at a fixed uniform price, and devoting the proceeds to the transmidson of young couples or young people of both sexes to the colonies. Before that the Government, desiring to change the charter of Van Diemen's lend from a territorial gaol to a colony, had offered great encouragement to free emigrants of the employing clas. Such as could show that they had capital obtained a maximaun grant of 2,400 acree, and were also assigned servants to cultivate it. Having improved the first grant,they hadno difficulty in obtaining another and another. In this way a body of counitr gentlemen grew up, and there are now many beautiful estates With large parks around the mans sions, with enclosures surrounded with whitethorn hedges, intersected by good roads managed by the resident owners. Thewe gentlemen form the body of the country magistracy, and often represent their coun. ties in the Iegislature. Many of them have become wealthy, but nearly all they have made has gone to the improvement of theirestates and the increase of their flocks and herds, and their gains do not materially swell the annual amount of capital seeking investment in the ordineary securities. In thi oolony we have no such class. There may be a few persons who dwell upon their own "1 purohased land," and have built good homesteads; but they are not numerous enough to form a distinct and conspicuous cless. The colony was notsettled untillorg afterthe lacd regulations of 1831 had been in full operation, and it was settled by squatters who acquired no permanent interest In the soil, but only a temporary and revocable interest in the herbage. These " astoral tenants of the Crown" divided the whole country among them. Gradually the great squatters succeeded in squeezing out the smaler squatters. They have always looked with dissatisfaction upon the progress of cultivation, and they hve usually been at war with the rest of society to seoure a perpetuation of their monopoly, and prevent the progress of settlements, which they regarded as enerocahing on their vested rights. To return to my subjeot. If speculative consignments to this colony and New South Wales are kept in due cheek, if our import trade is left to the control and regulation of our importing merchants, I do not appreherd any commercial revulsion from an excess of supply as compared with the effectual demand. If we }:ave any revulslen and glut It will arise from Cireumstances which will tend to impair the demand, and not from those 'vhich tend to aggravate the state of the supply. Overtraing in house building would have that effect; overspeculation In land rwould operate in the same way. I say this because credit is often extensively resorted to iu both these enterorises. The building and house-ownig interest Is now in the aacendant. They have no difficulty in obtaininglarge discounts from the banks, and this is almost the only way in which, to any extent, credit Is made to swell the amount of building speculation. To some extent, but iS a minor degree, money is a:so raised by way of mortgage for building purposes, but by this means the day of reckoning is more remote. The neceesity for meeting the three months' bills makes previous overtrading conspicuous the moment the banks take the alarm, and " put on the screw" by refusing renewals. Within a few months about a million and a half of capital has been proposed to be raised by new projects-payable by instalments. The Hobsou's Bay Railway Company propose to raise 150,0001, additional capital. A company to extend the line from St. lda to Brighton requirea 125,0001. ; anotber railway, to Brighton vid Richmond, Prahran, and East St. Kilda, 300,0004; a new bank, on thermutal principle, 5W0,0004; a new insurance company, 200,0001.; the calls oft 'he Colonial Bank of Australashi, 100,0001.; an omnibus company, 100,000. Here we have nearly 1,500,0001., Irrespective of the demand of the Government foz capital to carry on the several projected lines. Now, if a check ulpOn our cmmercial prosperity does lake place within the' next 18 months or two years it will olginate, not as the revulsion of 1854-6 did, in excessive importatlons over and above our very large demand, but froma our impaired purchaming powor, brought about by our goieBg a little too fast in public, semi-public, and private workE, requiring conant accretions of capital-money capital in the first instanee, substantive capital in the second instnce. At presnt I see no ground for the least apprehenson, but there ig enough in what is going on to demand vigilance. For intaxee, if coincidently with a moderate degree of pressure on our money-market to meet future instalment3 there should be an undue increase of importation, so as to impair the saleablenues of goods, that mnoderate preesure would soon become immoderate,nd we should have anotber commercial crisis. As to the demand for capital to carry on the great trunk railways now projected, this feature should be noted. Taking the average state of our reennue for the last three ye g tie colony is In a condition to meat a legislative piedge to snake the interAt ofirat cbarge on the revenuecrdinr7and territoriaL Ten millions 'will b required, but not in ono year. If vote 60&,C00. as a first charge to meet iatwestat6 pex cent., at tha.prefent rate of 6 per ent. debapto that rote would raise 10,600,000. But if we pour fit 1500,OWO to ,OO,000. out1ho market every yeazfortheneztthree or four yee. we ay expect sonme * *e tpio,f Q etuIt3" simP beo l Whn of money would necessarily rise, amd that deoline of price would cause them to be more sought after in the London markets. If the Government eksi t mrarket here, a large proportion of theso debentures would, no doubt, fiuad their way to England as remittances, so that, although in the first Instance we shall borrow here, the ultimpate lenders will be the Engsh capitalist, If We secure to the lenders the due payment of tho intereat on the capitl expended on railways, it Is of little importince to them whether the ral. ways pay a dividend or not. Tue lenders do not depend on the profitableness of the enterprise as sharehelders would do. They are In the position of the English lenden to the Govermment for the parposes of war expenditur I will even go further, and assert that to us the profitableness of the undertaltingis of secondary importance. If the railwrays paytheannualexpes3soof magementtogether witlh wearnd tear, they may afford a great ntional g3in, and msy greatly promote the increase of national welth by the saving of the oost of transport all over the country. At present the waste of capital in mere transport is enormous. if by an annual charge on the general rovenue of 600,0001. we enable the community to save three or four times that amount in the cost of carriage, the naional gain Is all ths diffbrence, though the railway only ays the eosts of keep. iug it in -working order. Our first experiment hs been very successful. Though the Hobson's Bay Bailway, constracted when common labourwas at its highest, and when all materials were twice their present prices, cost nearly, if not quite, I00,000 a.sile, it pais a dividend of 14 per oent. The St. Kilda branch, which cost oDly about 30,0001 per mile, will pay much more. The former depends principally on Its goods trafflc, the latter wholly on paaen gers. Our great railways wil depend chiely on the for. mer, and I believe will pay dividend at leat equal to the interest. A census of the population was tskea on the night of the 29th of M3arch. The details are not yet before the public, but the totals have been published, and I enelows the satements made up in accordance with the electoral dixvions of the colony. It will be seen that between 1854 and 1857 the total population has inoceased from 236,776 to 403,519, beang an increase of 70 per cet in tbroee year. Thee is an improvement in the proportion of the sexes, though the proportion of females to males I stI lamentably small. The following is a comparative statement of the two enumerations Males Femaes TotaL Females Oeames of 1854 .. .. 185,876 50,so. 586 77& as9 Censs of 1857 .. .. 2588116 145,483 403,519 561 In 1854 there were very few Cbinese in the colony; now there are 40,000, all males. If we deduct these from the males the population of European race will be21S,116 males and 145,403 females, or 66-6 females to every 100 males. The House of Assembly has resolved, by a olear majority of the Eouse, 31, which is necessary under the conastutiozn, to abolish State aid to religion at the end of 1859, This motion was remarkable as discloslngone of " the arrangements on minor matters" alluded to by Mr. Haines, on which the present Mlinistry in acting. Mr. lines, the Chief Secretary, who has always beea opposed to the abolition of the 53d clause, giving 50,0001. ayoar in aid of publLo worship, &o., to Christian sets, now voted with the majority. So did O'Shanassy. Tholgh the opponents of State aid rejoico in the result, I do not think the vote of Haines and O'Shanasay will do either of them much good. The colleagues whom Mr. Haines tbroewzemboard, and who continne sore about it, are said to sneer at his sudden change of opinion, but O'Shanassy's vote has silenced the opposition against Hinca, It is a troublesome question out of the way. The Government Bill for the management of the Crown lands has given great dissatisfaction. They have carried the second reading Ty a majority of 10, but it will be gratly cut up in committee. It is highly favourable to the squatters and injurious to small cxps talista who dedre to occupy land. If it pass In its present state, no labonring man who has the least ambition to become a small fsrmer should be advised to come to this coantry, oven though his passage be paid. If he be a mere hower of wood and rawer of water, oontent with good wages and cheap rum, without any desire to raise himself, he may come.

It was a sad mb,. take to send offthe Simla as the agents did. The GovernorGeneral steMner, from Sydney, was obliged to put back, and has rcoeived so severe a handling from the weather that it hs doubtful whether she will be seaworthy again.

Gentlemen of the Legislative Councl and Gentle- men of the House of the House of Assembly,- "I congratulate you tbat, for the present, your labours are brought to a close, and that, notwithstanding ocaiors of hindrance, you have been able to pass some useful and necessary measures. The progress of public busdness oould scarcely have been expected to be free from interruption in the initiation of Parliamentary Government, and Tamania has only shared in the experienoe of other Australian colonies; but the hope may be indulged, and is even aleady justified, that, with extended acqudntance with that form of government, Its principles and practice vwill be modified and adapted to local circumstancee, and its succeaful results will prove not lees than were anticipated fom its adoption. Among the measures which yolu have passed I enumerate with particular satisfaction, as being oalcuated to correct inconveniences that have been hitherto felt, or otherwise to conduce to the publc service,- II The Act to restore the jurisdiction of the Court of Itoquests for the district of Hobart Town; "' The Act for the bettor seouring the independence of ihe judges of the Sapreme Court - " The Act to abolish the exclusive jurisdiction of certn magistrates; and "*The public Works' Loan Act, in which provison Is made towards connecting Tasmania by submarine cable with the electric telegraphs and the main-land of Australia. -I regret that you have not been able to devise any measure in respect to the sale and settlement of the waste lands of the colony; but I fuLly admit and acquiesce in the expediency of postponing till the next sesion of Parliament the adoptionof any Bil on this subject, as prefer. able to its beig legislated on in a crude or parti malner, 'which wvoud require amendment at a future period.

The period of an appropriation of tho revenue is so commonly end conveniently fixed at 12 months that the shorter perod provided in the Bisyou. have submitted for 1857 'will not, I hope, become a precedent. "Hon.

The newspapers publish from the Customs' returs the stocks of the bonded stores of the several articles liable to duty under our 'arf,; hut they do not afford any means of comparing stocks And prices in different years. I have taiken out the stocks in June 1855, 1856, and 1857, and have added the prices of some of the articles 'which admit of comparison from the known and uniform quality of the article. Thas the0 prie affxed to brandy is that of Martel's best, thAt of ale is rfor Bass's; tobacco, Barrett's ; tea, best congou. It 'will be seen that prices have risen in spite of increased stocks, hut I believe that in June, 1856, wheu stocks were low in the bonded stores they were large in dealers' handse. Latterly advancing prices have induced the dealers to buy only from "h and to mouth." The increased stocks, how. ever, will be a warning in favour of that caution which I have lately recommended : VOr EROIAJ., INTlEl;LIGENoa}> .

The circumstances of the caue ore as follows :-A min namei Joeeph Hiemacher, a German, living on Macomb. street between Aivarduan uselL, went out on Tuesday mornong, In compsay with a little brother, to pick rasp. berres. They carried their dinners with them and went some five or sIx miles out before commencing Eeir day's work.

It was but th work of a mooment to dron hii boeket of berries and hurzy with his younger brother £mvy m the spot. He saw two boys anot far from him when he left the spot, but sid nothing to them., Before himself and brother had got a safe distance they heard terrible screams in the directon they had left, which only served to aelerate their pace and ple a grter distance between them and danger. They were soon giertaicen by one of tbe boys, who camae rushing after thea ia a bewilderment of frigh tscreamingtha te bear was utlngup bis brother. Rademacher received this intelligerce in utter dismay and took to his beelawith aiwi, followed by the twobo auad de. serting the smfferertnbisfate.

IRELAND. (FROM Ous ow0 CORRMsPONn DYUBLIN, SATURDAY ionON=. TEE POPE IN IREAND. Those ill-timed revelations from Rome, brought to light by the Paris correspondent of The Times. still stick in the throats of the Irish lltramontane journals. To give them the lie en mawsse would be out of the question; so the next best thing to be done is to fritter them away by %wkward e lanations. The Tabiel of this day returns to the carge, and, admitting " that there is a screw loose, that something has gone wrong, that there is a split, that there is never snmoke without fire," &c., the organ makes this candid confesinn nf th. b a aIumonlon- *'It is notorious that during the last five years the great majority of Irish Catholic membera, instead of acting up to the policy of 1851, have regularly enlisted in the Ministerlal ranks, and voted, or abetained from voting, at the bidding of the Miiter. Having done this, they have returned to their constituets, and have been re elected. They bad the countenance and support of-many of the bishops and clergy when they went toParlianent to carry out one poliev; they retain that support and countenance when they return from Parliament, having sstematically carried out that policy. God forbid that we should question the right of any man to change his opinions, or on the mere fact of a change found any Imputation. Bat wihile the change has destroyed the *unanimilty wkdch existed and marshalled the Catholic forces in opposite Interests, there is the further fact that one side wholly fails to see any reason for the change, while on the other no defence or lustficatlon has ever been attempted*" THE BnriTsn ASSOCLTION.

THE NEW Cnuirox oF PRs.-It is confidently reported that the new title taken by the Marquis of InAdowne will be Duke of Kerry. The designation now chowe will be most appropriate, inasmuch as the Marquis is already Earl of Kerry, having suc ceededasfourth LEal and 24th Baron of Kerry in the Lerage of Ireland on the death of his cousin, Francis homas, tbue third Earl, without issue, July 4, 1818, and his eldest won actually bore the arladom of Kerry as his courtesy title down to his lamented death in August, 1836. We may be pardoned for reminding our readers here that, with the exception of the title of Ducbess of Inverncss, bestowed some years since on Lady Cecilia Underwood, this will he the flrstDukedom conferred upon a subject by Her Majesty inoeheracoession tothethrone. Ourreaderswillnothaveforgotten that Lord Ioansdowne, as Lord Hienry Petty, acatually succeeded the late Eight Homn William Pitt as Chancellor of tae Exchequer cud as XLP. for the University of Cam. bridge uards of 60 years since, and that he has held a eti teUpr~ House for nearly haLlf a century, barn sumceeded to the peerane November 16, 1809. Lord Robert Grosvenor, it is said, will choose the title elther of Lord Ebury or Lord liddlesex. We may as well mention that the large property in Middlesex now known as Belgravla came into the Grosvenor family through thb marriage of their Ancestor Sir Thomas Grosvenor, third baronet, about the middle of the 17th century, with Mry, only daughter and heiress of Alexander Davis, Esq., who owned the ancient manor of Ebury, in that county, The Earldom of Middlesex was formerlv the eecond amd courtesy title belonging to the Sackvilles, Dukes of Dorset, but became extinct together with that dukedom on the death of Charles, fifth and last duke, without issue male, in 1843. The Obsrver states oflicially that Mr. Macaulay I to be raised to the peerage as Baron Macaulay; aud we believe that the English barony borne by his late uncle will be renewed to the present Earl of Fife, who recently accepted the Chiltern Hundreds for the county of Banff, after having represented that constituency for 20 years. I NW ROM TO THE CONTerT.-On Wednesday a special experimental trip was made from Dover to Dieppe by the Roy.l and Imperpal mail-packet Prince Fredernck W| ;Iiam, with the view of testing the advantages of the route, and the celerity with which the passage can be per. formed by swift steamers from Dover to that vastly impcoved and improving French watering-place. The day was remarkably finesndthe sea smooth; the steamer got fairly off fomtheAdmrallty- ier t&15a.m., and,without stopping or eazing, ran the straight course of 74 nautical miles, past Boulogne, Eochelle, and Treport. down the beautiful end bold Normandy coast, to the pierheadof Dieppe in 4 hours and 48 minutes, thus avenging nearly 18 tatute miles an hour. She remained in Dieppe harbour until a quarter to 4 o'clock, started from abrast the lighthouse at 4, and " eased her engies on nearing the Admiralty pier, Dover, within fise hours from the moment of departure, bavin zmaae the two passages there and back in hose and 48 mlnutes, at the average rate of 17. statute miles an hour. This experiment has opened out another cholce of roads to Parts, and one of the quickest and most a ble to the summer traveller, who does .ot care about being double the time he is ordinarily At sA in erosing tootherportg. If apassenger had left London at half-past 8 onWednedlay morning, had gone over to Dlepe by the Prince Frederick William, and had proceeded by tOe i trda direct to Parls from Dieppe, he would have arrived at Paris in a shorter space of time than by the egular trains and boat tatmornin vi Calais, this new route, of course, being traversed under favourable cizcumstanom Tb PineFrederik Yllli-m was turned out from the T esIlronworks At BlACYwaUl.; she is 325 tons, 170 feiet long, 20 feet broad, and has oscillating enginea of a nomiinal force of 120 hora-Po#rer, It 3xveuhi, Wakeld, and Co., of Glasahouseflelds.

Gordon, Sheriff of the oounty, and other officials. Open cariages were in waiting to oonvey She Royal rty to Holyrood Paiae. Within the Quees' Park and on the slopes of the contiguou heights there was a lrge sand animated araemblage waitng to me the illustrious vitor, the great beautYof tbe teaber having attracted larger hrng than has perips been men sinoe Her Majest's viit oased to be a novelty le. The Royal ortgce paed, preceded by an scort of tbei Dragoon Guards. Next to Her Majesy the object of attra. tion to the Ryal crowd was the Prines Royal. The member of the Boyal party, however, who seemed moet Interested by the scene was the young Prince Arthur, whoie first ,ist it was to Scotland, and who stood up In the cor. riage and eagerly suveyed the brei t and lively scene. The way was lined by the 5th Dragoon Guards, the Royal Artillery, and 1st Battalion Rifle Bxigado; the brlliant uniforms of the cavalry, the blue tunics of the Artllry, aud the sombre costume of the Rifles alike glittering witk the medals which rewarded their Valour and service in the ate war. Among those who were onspicuous for their nume. rous deorations may be mentioned Lleutenant.olonel M'Mshon, of the 5th Dragoon Guds, and Lieutenant Colonel Someset, of the Rifdes. The Royal paty, who prooeeded to the Palae of Holy. rood at an easy pace, arrived there at about 20 mInutes to 7. In the vestibule her Majesty was awaited by the Duke of Buccleaoh, Sir Benjanin Hal (who had arrived In Edin. bErgh the previous evening), the Lord-Provost, Mr. Ruther ford, Deputy Keeper of the Palace, &o. After remaining a rew minutes in the Palace, Prinoe Albert proteeded with Sir B. Hall to inspc the inprovements now being effected around the Palace, and they were shortly after. wards joined by the Queen aed the Prinoe BRoyaL Since the passing of the Istimates several acres Of groumd have been added to the arden on the south wving of the Palaoe. The ornamental railing which formerly endroled the garden has been thrown oat on either side of tho quadrangle, and the enlarged area is now enolosed behind by a wall, which Is six or eight feet high fronm the prk, but is built Dup wltbn by a aloping embank. ment of earth, which at first sight appears to be in -nbroken conneydon with the park outeide, and on the summit off which a level terrace Is formed, to which the wall affords only a very low parapet On this terrace Her Majesty walked for some minutes, and also Inspected the other iri. provements. which include a carrlage-way In the rear of the Palsce, and a pictaresqne arrangement of the garden, iu which more privaey wll be afforded than has hitherto been enjoyed by the inmates of the Palace. The dinner party in the eenng consisted of the Queen, the Prince Consort, and the Prince Royal, Lord Clarendon, Lady Churchill, the Hon. Flora Macdonald, Major-General Grey, Sir James Clark, Sir B. Hall, and the Ren. Colonel Phipps. The band of the Risle Brigade performe& dulng dinner. RiTuRnDA ArTrxi?ooy, Her Majesty and the Royal party resumed their jouney northwards this morning at half-past 9 o'dock-a somewhat later hour of starting thn usa, as the journey is rendered somewhat shorker by the BlaIrgowrie route. The carriages left the Palace about 10 minutes after 9, and a, Royal salute tas fired from the Castle as Her Majesty passed through the park. It was a lovely morning, and there was again a lge asembloge In the park. The militar arrangement were the [same as on the previous evening. Viscount MelvlLe, tha Lord-Provogt, and the Sheriff were in waiting to receive Her MaNety at the ebation, as were also Mr. Blackburn, MLP, and other directors and officials of the Edinburgh and Glsgow Railway. The train. was In readinesn, aranged as on the previous day, and the Boyaa prry htaving taken theirr sats, and the usual salutations being intercanked between themn and the gentlemen and ladies on the platform, it comnmencod its jon- raing the city of Zdinburgh, the trin dashed along at full speed, reaching Stirling about 10.40, where a detachment from the Highland dep6tS preeented arms, and the guns of the ancient castle discharged a Royal salute. About an hour later the train pased through Porth, and reached Blairgowrie at half-pat 12, wvherepost carrigos were In waiting to convey the dhlnguled party to Balmoral- The Queen and uite proceeded to Bsalnoral by the Spittal of Glenshee. At the Spittal Hote, 'where there wax a fresh relay of horse, Her Maiesty was reoeived by the Farqubarson family and had luncheon, and then posted by Braemar, arriving at Baimoral M 6 o'clock in the evening. Since tho Court left Balmoral in October lat year the Royal residence and grounds have undergone mnny Improve. ments. The Castle is now finished; the lat vetige of the old buildings has disappeared, and the spawous lawn In front of the new house is already covered by the purple heather and a thriving plantation. On the oait dde a very extensive range of stabling has been erected, and all about the Castle and by the bank of the Dee there are finely gravelled walks and green bank terraces. But the principal Improvement Is the cat4Iron bridge over the Dee. An Act of Parliament having beent obta to authorize a diversion of the south road to the north slde, so as to preserve the deer forest and secure the privacy of the Castle, a new bridge became necessary, and. this hia Doyal Highness has had built at his own expense The bridge is 165 feet span, and Is constructed on the princdple of the tubular bridge across the Menai Strait. Great changes have taken place In tho interior et the Castle. The furniture that had been used in the oldaboue, and was with some additions adapted to the new one, ha all been sold, and furniture made of A.merlcan ash has taken its place. Everywhere throughout the Cuse the appointments are remarkable for simplicty of ehacter and puity of taste. With the ecceptlon of the oorrddor, which are all painted in dark marble, there iz no pint to be seen, the whole of the framework being varnahed. The apartments of the Prinoess Royal uas just Anihed, to be occupied by her Royal Highness only for a season; but an axtist is busily engaged making drawings of them to be sent to Berlin. While the new house has thus been oompleed, the people on the property have not been neglected. There are now two schools for the childreu of the crofters and servants about the Castle; new cottages have ben buit for the poor tenants, and old ones improved. In the neighbourhood of the Castle neat eotteges are being built, while the country about Deeside genenrlly undergoing a great change in Its social aspect and dome*le appearance. Five years ago one coach was sufficient for all the puasengeri travelling between Aberdeen and Braemnrlast year 12,000 persons passed over the side railway, an& most of them for the upper disticts of the country. The game on the estates of the Prinoe Consort 1as ben well preserved, and it is fully expected by tb. game}eepes that there will be no lack of grouse on the moor The deer are also plentiful and strong.

Grosvenor se their repreetatve In the Commons Hoowe of PlIs. meet. The ag toom Wsu filled, 'ad on the Ion. Sentlema making his apperane in the ball, supported by his friands, he wa mot enthudastically eheered. The Ron. G. BYxG, said he felt he wau coming among them As a strger, but he bore a name which was ot so, and it wa perty en tha round thst he &p. pased before them th"t evening, Before he refered to the politica ambjeca of the day he wsbed.toiaka few remarks why he appeared In his present podstio a a cand;date for their nffrges, and here he might e Ikt to represent the Importua oonstituency of Middlesox ad always been the bighest point of his ambition. (Har, hear.) Lost Tuesday he most unexpectedly ze. eei'ed a telegraphic maeage while In Germany sting that the st wa vacant, upon which he immediately hastened to meet the eletors, and isued his ddre askdng their xuffrage, (Hoar, hoer.) This was the -Lrn meetlng that he had held, but he hopod it would not be the lac* lIe should ste bhs views on the different politial questions of the day, and leave it to the eleetors to AY wrhether theywould not return him as their member. Having spologied totheelectors for detoinig them with the few remarks relative to himself, he would now briefly touch on tho state of tho eoUntry abroad and our hou,e policy. With rea to the former, therewaa one subject in particlar that at present engrOmed the publiO attention, one on which apolitidan,cadespcdlUy *youg one, should be ouful iD giviDgr opinion-he meant the state of our Indian empire (hear), in which scenes of bloodshed and massacre rero now no srngers He had heard it said that the country and Government were unpretered for this sudden outbreak. It did m to him impossble that so fearfua state of thinge could have arsen without some great and serious eases He thought that neglect and superstition, indolence and supinenes, had had something to do with it (Rear, hr.) mie dsa so becaue the Warnings of General Sir C. Napier and other distinguished men of experience must ha,L, shown that some grat outbreak would occur. (Hear, hear.) He sid neglect and supineness, becuse those |offiers who had ben in chage of the Sepoys had been removed nd pled in the civil service, and the Sepoys, thus finding that there was no ona to take charge of themr, i- taken advantage. He felt that it was an utter imposbity to hold our Indian empire by jostice alone. There must be an adequate force to support that justice. (Cheers.) Agaii, he thought that most reprehensible of all sytems, entralization, had had something to do with the preeent stae of affairs in India. Scarcely an officer in India had ny control placed in his hands-as an instane not even the sntence of a oourt-martiel could be carried into effect without going to the h4ghest in authorlty for unction. These things were the great source from which this shoking mutiny aos69. It might be said that they ought to have been forewarned and forearmed, England hada most efficient army at the time of the Iussia war, but After that it was thought there would be a politica lull, and this Indian affair came on suddenly. it would not be policy for Her Majesty's Miinisters to go to the House and ask the members there and then to sanction any great and Important change in the army, by either dlnsandlntr or augmenting the army. What would hon. memDers say to their constituents if they merely took the word of a Minister that sueh a thing wa no=es without sking for the fallest information on the sub eIctR Hls opinion was that theWe must be a Iager force in ndi. Hd thereEbeen that-and it could have been had If Ovey information had been given on the subject-they would not have had India in its present state, and meny valuable lives night have been saved. However as it was now there was no help for it, only by looking wel into the geation of what should be done for the future. He _- that Sir E Peny had a notioe on the7paper of the House d a motion which he intended to introduce next &eedon,whether it rould not be more desirable that the government of Indib should be tranusferred from the East Indis Comny, and for the fture become part nd parcel of Her Majt Government. (Hear.) It wa a great and important subjectt and he could not say precisely how he should vote if he Were in Parliament. verything, perhaps, had been done with the best intention for Indis, but he eould not helD thinking that if some great and distinguished man, well acquinted with Indic, eouldbe found that would be respa. sible to Pnaliaentk his Queen, and country for all that was sdd or done in India, then there would be a much beter sate of things. With regard to the other part of Eurohe he thought we were in a tidsfactory oondition, but sT one foreg relations msnt be watched with anxiety. (Hear.) He should always advocate a most spirited foreign olicyshown In deeds and not in words. After a few rem& rs with regard to the conduct of Lord Strtford de Bedeliffe, the ho,- aArtkman. wfhr,dnt to the non-fulfilment of a esrtsin portionof the trety of PaxlR, expreeed an opinion tbtthe waS every prospect of ite being carried out to its very letter. C ring, then, to home Ars the chief pointa that had enaged his attention were Parliamentary re.orm, vote b t, ot, weish disabilities, and church-rates. (Ea&r, hear He thought the questiOn of Parliamentary reform one o greatest that oul be expatiated on. TheyhadlatelyIhe. several measures introduoed, but zone had been crried. Lord Palmerson en the firt night of the last seion pna the Hounse to undestand that early next session a lrge and comprehendso ineeaure of reform should be in. troduced, and when Lord Palmerston got up in hbi aeat as Prime Minister and s.m tb.t h.. ar_ ZYrg) thought there wee no doubt that * inea sure would be ilntroduoed. Then arose the queson what would that measure be? (Choers.) The question ok reform was one onwbich the people ol the country should say something to Vide the Government for, let them depend on3 it, if the peopo wauted any chege in their represntatve qstem they must zo and, by holding public meetings and so on, they wvowshowGovernment what they didcl (Oheers.) He thought there should be a large extensdon ofthe frneiso for by thepreentsysem therewas agreat rnoo of people at present precluded, who were as fit and roper penrsos to otDe aB any who now had the privilege. Wa not in favour of universal suffrage, but tho .pt i teazt of edcaion or resecabRiity sould be aIpe to all men above age, and thou millionS would4 be ab«e to vote. Be trstedw -this would form one of the firstpoints in any meure of reform. lie also thought thee hould be a roor equl division of electoral distrfis th at present and that the qystem of proerty quaiiation ahouldbe done away witL (Hear, bear. They did not hae It In Scotland, then why should they in England and Irelande -for by removtng It the House would be acoemble to a hrge number of talnted men. He supportd the moton for that object introduoed by Mr LocLe King but it was reted, not by a mority of Liberal membr but by the Conservative4 who ays opposed ever mea ure of reform. He h ame t the vote by hello ear) By giineg them the ballot prection would be givento thoe vrho bad Dany fr, nd Ft would give secret voti to those tht had the screw ptdidnot think It would do 11 the good that it was id it would, for if a man wa bed he would continue so, do whxteer they could. The quesion had always hbs support dneeb he had been in Perils ment, {(Cheers) Referringto the civil disabilities spon their Jewish fellow-subjects, the hon. gentleman sid It wa Imposible that the questlon sbould be allowed to drop, for It mzou he brought forward Valn early next seion, and then, If the peosle were rsunamous that this lst blot on the shield ofv and religious liberty should be removed he tbought the Rouse of lords must give WyIL. they retrned him he wold devot the whole ofthl time and What abiltIes he poued to the faithful dicarte his dutes and hepromisd that he would neverloe sight of thelr lol Intere (Chers.)
