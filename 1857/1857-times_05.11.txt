MiEETING OF CONVOCATION. TTPPrnP.' iiTrnyq Their LOrdahlps re-assembled on Saturday morning a' 10W ocl,ok. His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury presided. The right rev, prelates who were present were the Bislhop of London, tho Bishop of Winchester, the Bishop of St., David's, the Bishop of Oxford, tho Bishop of St. Asaoh, 'nfl the Bishop of Salisbtury. The Address, as amended by the Lower House, was bronuht' up, and the endments, after discussion, were expunged. The Prolocutor was summoned, and his Grace tho President, in returning the Address, stated that their Lordahips oh. jected to tho paragraph recommending an extension of the; episcopate, because they might hereafter be reqiured, specially to advise the Crown upon the subject. Tho ProRo0U'Ton withdrew, and upon his return re., ported that the Lower Eouse had agreed to the Address lin the terms sanctioned by the Upper House. His Grace the PRErSIDENT then signed tho writ of pro. Togation to Wednesday, the 20th of May, but informed the Prolocutor that the buainess of Convocation would not bei resumed until after the Address hsa been prmsented to Hrer MaJesty, and that it would not be necessary, therefore, to; summon the committoes for an earlier day. Tho prooeedings, which were of no interest, were concluded at 1 o'ock, and tho upper House was immediately dissolved. LOWER HOUSE. Tho Lower House met again on saturday morning in thbe Jerusalem Chamber. The Prolooutor (the Dean of Bristol)1 was in the ohxir, and there wore present tho Deans of Ely' and Canterbury, the Archdeacons of Wells, Tatmton. St." Aban'e, Coventry, Maidstone. Worcester. Berks. Westminster, London, Middlesex, Bedford, Bristol, and lfontti gomery, Dr. Jelf, and tho Master of tho Temple. The at, tendancO of proctors wvas not so numerous as on Friday. In al there were about 40 members present. The POLOCUTOn intimated tat with th viewr of scerT tamiing who attended the House it was desirable that eachb member should hand in his name as he arrived. Absenteesl wero liable to be fined for disobeying the summons to at4 tondr and it might become a qoesfon wether the fener should not bo enforced. The names of mmbers havingobeen called over, The PrOd ocTonB Btated that oiong to a mistike the Chapter of Rochester had returned two proctors. It wai resovdo that tho attention of his Grace tho Aihbishop shouldbedrawntothefircuimsce with o view to the correction of this error. T The minutes of the previous day's proceeding haying been readnd a confirmed, th Prolocutor and the s Deas pi sent were directed o convey the Address which had beel agreed to on Fridsy evening to tho Upper Honse On their return fron this mission, 1 The Rev. JasiES Terd Dto , proctor for tho diocesa of Ely, presented a gravamen, praymg thatmth service for the accession of Her Iajesty might be referred to the Occar sdonal Services Committee, in orer that it might be asceri tained whether this service did not contravene the Act o Uniformity. On the motwon of the Archdeacon of TAINTON the gr yamon was reEerred to the committee mentoned. The Rev. J. rlso anpreseoted p gravamen complbtRv ing that the unbeneficed clergyj thouth hayins the care souls, were excluded from the rightaof oting for members of thenLower Hose of Convocation. I This dwcument was referred to the Commlttee of Gra; vammna, as was also another presented by the teee . On. CLteGmTON on the subject of prosentment, by churchwardens, so far as they relaed to notonioui offenders. By tho canons of tho church, churchwara dens rere required to present, and the clerj g to anmnounce, notorious offenders at the time of serce; such a proceeding had become practically impossible, and the gravamen pray7ed that it might be reconsidered.j Onthe motion of the rBev. Sir H. Tholisoy a comtmittee was appointed "to consider the present construction of the Lower louo of Convocation wvith a viev to devise and recommend scht altrtons asin the budgment of such committel ar rendred neoessary by the changesl of the times, and appert best calculated to seoure for Convocatio, the confidence of the paohiallergy, of the laity, andof the GZovernment."! Some conversation then took placoeupon theomode of sunj moning Convocstion and conducting its business, It was com 1aind thnt the Lower HIouse was not allowed mdli. denttimie for the dischar,ge of its important functions, and that there were no rules for conducting its discussions such az were enforced in other deliberative aswemblies. In the course of this oonversation it was stated that the present Convocation had bean more numerously attended than any other in modern times. In obedience to amessage from the Ulpper House, the Prolocutor and Deans niroceeded thither to recelve the decision of their Lordship. on the amendments to the Address. Shortly afterwardsthe returued withthe Addres%, wsich w7as ultimately adopted, as ii had finally been framed by the Upper House. THE CO-OPErATION OP THE LAT. The Rev. Cauno WORDSWORTH then rose to move thb following resolution, of which he had given notice on the preious day:- I ta commisee ot this House be aDpointed to conside the but mean of obtaning the counsel and co-operatlon of tbe lity of tbe curch, Darticularly at annual vstation or diocesan synodsa ar4 that the coumittee be desired to report to this House on t e -bject as soon as cvnven: e at; and also to fame the draught of a dutiful repreeutatloa n pon it from this House to hisl Gc the Pezrdeut and their LurdhipDs in the Uppr zouse." It would be rememberedl that at the close of the last Convocation the proctor of tho diocess of Worcester (the Rov. 3Mr. Seymour), in a speech remarkable both fr the exhaustive falness of its matter, and for the graee and felicity of its argument (hear, hear), proposed the a pointment of a commaittee to consider the best means o obtaining the assistance of the faithful laity of the ohurch in connexion with the provincial synod of Canterbury. On that occasiinthe previous quesifon was carried, on tho gronud that it was premature to entertain this subject. There was also a general feeling that this particular mode of dealing with it would in some degree contravene the ancient vatholic constitution of the provincial synods, which were oonstituted of the spirituality of the realm. As so constructed, the synods rested upon an ancient presumnptive title of at least five centuries, and it would have been very dangerousto introducoe an organic change, which woul i require the sanction of an Act of Parliament, and would thus substitute for the immovable precriptive right of five ceutuoies a title founded upoa anAct of Parliament passed to-day and which might be repealed to-morrow. (Hear, bear.1 At the same time all the members of thut House fEelt that there was much soundness in the argument 80 tempe,ately and ably stated by the Rev. Mr. Seymour, and that this was a matter which required their most serious attention. Actuated by this feeling, he had himself subnitted to the House a proposition that they should join in a dutiful rePresentation to the Upper House, that his Grace and their Lordships would take such measures as might seem to them best for enlisting in the service of the churi'l the co-operation of the faithful laity at the snnual visitations or diocesan synods. That motion received a good deal of favourable consideration, but the proceedings of Coavocation were closed without any decison having been come to upon it. It had afforded him great satisfaction that his proposal was, without concert, seconded by the proctor for the diocess of Lincoln, the Rev. Mr. ingberd, and he must also tender his thanks tothe Rev. Mr. Sey. iour for having originated the discussion on this subject. That discussion had given rise to such indications of oordial self-sacrifice, disinterestedness, good wilL, good temper, and Christian harnmony as to entitle that House to the confidence of the country, in the persuasion that its debatea would always be marked by the same spirit of Christian forbearance and charity. (Hear, hear.) Wis present propo. sition was simply for a committee, and he had preferred that that committee should consider not whether the laity should be admitted to that provincial council of Canterbury but whether we ought not to begin in our parishes and dioceses to make experiments in the rudiments of our ecclesiastical polity before tampering with what heConsidered one of the best inheritances of Englishmen, the convocation of this province. Tho annual visitations were properly diocesan. synods, a fact to which witness was borne by the termS "didesmen" and "synodais.' (ihear, hear.) What he proposed was that the bishop or the archdeaeon who vsited for him-and there wre in that House 55 archdeacons, who might at once carry out this suggestion- should select certain of the more inteiligent laymen, in order, not that they should voto with the clegy or even the clergy with the bishop, but that by G od's Pro1vidence it might be ascertaied what were the feelings, opinioes, and judgment of both laity and clergy. Objections might be raised to selection by the bishop or archdeacon onthe ground that synods, often called "packed synods," consisting merely of nominees of the bishop, did not obtain the con dence which would be given to them if their members were nominated by the parishes. In Cran. mer's Ref os-moo Legu7rv there were six chapters devoted to IS subect. It wasthere aaidthat the laity who should take part in these synodsshould be those whom the bishop desired toremain ; butthe persons fromwhomthehishopwasto make his choice seemed to be those who had beenpo sent bv th typed ruleoeinfthe ODoto of any streot pd rleforth whle f t~nlad and Wales, which he thought wol etret Us that we mnight,atlati soecesadpthanit organization of chrhwren n idesm Pt the chureh. wardlensi were thehleso rsea been calculated b oea 00Pr~ hc a tainly amonetoales OO0l,adaotO00. was annuallyepnddisednthmtvstaos which, with a few peddecpin,wr rdcieo very inadequate reut.HOhoftta heewudb ditficulty in selectn ashnomineeupersons ancient laws,i andtaitwudb u nwieot APPointd by Office Of churchwardens, or to aleaetei feton by arbitrarily and caPriciously choosig otheir perstons to take Part in Proceedings in which they had since the, ReOformation hiad a principal place.

This showed that they mut not rely upon the broken rad of central societies, bat must endaavoor to substitute for them something more effecttial Thib, ho belioved, could best bo done by the revivification and reaniimation of our diocesan system. The keystone of the societarian arch was the Royal letter, and that having been withdrawn there was danger - that the dioceses would be the ecenes of contests between zival societies which were jostling each other on the steps of the pulpib in order to gain the eas of the people. The rev. Canon concluded by proposing his resolation. The Arhideaoio of ST. AxtnAN'S seconded the notion He asserted that the Church of England had not for a long time eljoyed, as she ought from her constitution to njoy the advantage of the concurrene of the laity with the clergy in the administration of her affairs, and pointed to the succe-s of the diocesan boards for edutation and the building of churches, in which the laity were joinled with the clorgy, as indicative of the Lenefit which would result from the co-operA. Uon off the laity in the affais ofh the church. He was always Prepared to maintain that to obtain this cooperation it was at the present time deeiairbe to begin with those annual meetings of the clergy which occurred at the archi. diacon a and diocesn vistations. At preent these visita tIons were most unsatisfactory. (lrear hear.) It wiu impossible to tell whether they were religious, delibertv judicial, or convival meetings (a laugh; all were so mixedt together in such a missrable jumble that he was hearty glad when his yearly visitation was over. It would be of great advantage to the archdeacons who held an inferior position in the church to be supported by the voioe of the le,gy at large, nsd likewise of the laity. Some doubt eexsttato wae ther archidiaxonalv vitataons were properly deliberative synods, hut there wa no doubt that they were judicial, the primary idea bein thAt they should report presentments, and should inqure into evils which might eaist in parishes or in persona, into the state of churches, and into other questions. He himself thought that they vere also deliberative svnods, and that this element might with -great advantage be brought out, It was aometimes thought tbht, if there were synods, to admit the laity would be to alter their character, That objertioi hiad, he thought, been met by the statement of Canon Wordsworth, that the laity would be united with the clergy, as in diocesan Bynods the clergy were united with the bisbo v not to veto or to determine and decree auqthing with Lu n but as a consultative committee to aid hun by their advico and coounseL It might be urged that thA churchwsrden as a t present constituted, many of them not being members of th e church, coud not fairly and real ssnably be considered as the representatives of the laity His answer to that was that they were only at the commence. ment of what might, he hoped, prove g,ent and benefica reform,, an that the better plan would b to take the machinezy which they had at hand and work it as well as they could. Of this he wa certain, thatthera could be no more eeectual means of raising the character of those selected to ffll the ancient and hooourable office of churchwardens than showing that they were eleced for high purposes and that great responsibilities were ast upon them. (Hear, hear. Beaies this action upon the churchwardens themselves, o) whom he desired to speak with the greatest respet, the presence of the laity in the synods would have a inost beneficnil effect upon the action and infuence of the chmrch in the parishes All wbo had had the charge of a lugge and diffi. cult parish raus have felt how painful amd harasing the posilion Of the clergyman was rendered by his almost perfect isolation, and must have been conscious of the existence in the Vestry Of A feeling that the inoumbent appoint one churchwsrden to represent hin and to fig his battles, and that the parishioners elecet d otleus to th, the clergymanas churchwarden and keep Lim ad the incumbent himself within bounds If tOh churchwardens were elected, not merely to superin. tend the afirs of the church in the parish and to asst the clergyman in the performance of his duties, but also to attend the synods in order to advance the interests of the -church at lrge, it would give an altogether different chsracter to the office, and would Probably impress a differezt charateer on the men who filled it, and very much strengthen the cause of the church in the parishes and dioceses. The Bev. Sir HENRY THSONasoN said, that the bishops had recommended that only half the collection should be returned to the National Society, and that the other halt should be retained for diocesan purposes. Some of tbe bishops had not yet Issued their letters, and thes7e two Ct. cumatances togethe r might a ount for some of the f alin off w hich bad been referred to by the7 Rev. Canon Wordsworth. At the suggestion of the Rev. J. VsxcxNT, who thoight that it would be undesirable to confine the investigations of this committee to "annual visitations or diocesan synods," The Rev. Canon WoRDswouRT consented to iDnert in his motion, afterthose words, the words "or in any other mode that m ay be judged expedient." The B ev. Mr. SE -R supported the motion, but could not concur in all that had fallen from Dr. Wordsworth in proposing it. He did not think that there would be any danger in giving to the faithful laity of the chaurch apostion in strict connezion with that House of Convocation, and it was because he believed that the committee would not be precluded from considering some plan for the representation of the laity in that Haouse that he should concur in this motion. Archdeaon DnIsoxs said that, having at his last visita. tion taken the sense of the clergy and laity throughout his archdeacoury, and having found that without exoeption the clergy and uhurchwardens were favourable to the holding amUeetingat which they mightnOtdeiirate so sas to vote,baAt mighttakce commonconsultation uponmatters very nearly connected with thzeinEteret of the clergy and of the church atie7-he was owbouttotrythe experiment, and he trusted that with God's blessing it might be attended with sucess. The Rev. H.A. WOODGATE concuredwith whathad been said by Dr. Wordsworth, but had some doubt how far a recommendation upon this subject could go from this House to the bishops. HaA the laity been more consulted as to church matters he beieved that the disturbncesw which had occurred in some parishes as to rubrics and such matters would never have taken plaCe, The Hon. and Rev. S. WAI DEGR,VE thou;ht that if the laitv were called together to express their opinions without bewng al wed to vote no good would rsult from the revival of these diocesan synods. Instead of attempting to revive confidence in a number of small bodies, it would be better to begin at the fountain head and restore confidence in Convocation itself by a fairer representation of the clergy, and by admitting lay members who should take part in itb eliberations and should have a right of voting. Archdeacon HAs msou said that, if he thought that the adoption of this proposition was to be the first step towards an ateration of the constitution of the provincial sgnods, he should certainly oppose it. (Hear, hear.) His reason for supporting it wae that it seemed to him to adopt a different course. At the same time he suggested that the committee should be appointed only to inquire and report, and that the consideration of the representation to the other House should follow upon that report The Rev. Canon WORDSWORTH consented to omit from his resolution the words referring to the representation. The Rev. Mfr. CLAUGHTOX thought that Dr. Wordsworth had not quite done justice to the laity, from whoes co. operation in missionary and other societies the church already derived great advantge. He thought that there would be danger in calling the laity 'together in the synods, and then not alloiNng them to vote. The Rev. Dr. a l'CAus. also bore testimony to the great advantage already derived by the clergy from the c-opera. tion of the laity. se had no objection to the appointment of A committee to consider the best means of nrocuring the assistance of the faithful laity, but he objected to the intro- duecon of the words "diocesan *ynods," bec use many of the bishops would not call them together, and many of the laity objected to themas strongly s did the bishops. He there.'ore moved that those words should be omitted from the resolution. The Rev. Fr. Vss-a2c seconded tho amendment. Archdeacon TaonPX (Bristol) said, that In his on arch. deaconry it had for many yearsbeen cuLstomary to invite any laymen attending the visitation, wrho wrere willing to do so, toconsult itht teclergy, and thess cor.sultations had not been unproductive of practical benefits. The Arch deacon of WeRCESTgR said, that he andhIis brother of Coventry had on two occasions consulted the clergy of their archdeaconries with great advantage. The Rev. Sir HENRY Taosso,so concurred with the Rev. Mr. Waldegrave that instead of beginning with the dioceses the comumittee ought to begin with Convocation. After all that had been said about diocesan synods he had but a very Bhadowy idea of what they were to be. How were they to be summoned? To what extent was the laity to be admitted to them, and what measure of authority was to be given to them? Thee diesau synods woul ld be very dangerous instruments to set in motion, because we did not know what they might do. Some few years ago a prelate in the West called together a synod, which passed some very grave and serious resolutions, condemning a sentence which had been passed by the highest spiritual court in the kingdom. There 'Was now in the courts a case of equal importance, which wag nearly ripe for decision. Suppose that when that decision was s p r onounced two s yods were called to consier it, oxn n at flerwick and the other t B,d-si-, how -difIer,ntigl be their opinions of it, He therefore thought that to encourage the calling of synods would be to do that which would most likely very seriously damage the clergy in the estimation of the laity. The Archdeacon of COVRrrrnY said, that the answer to Sir H. Thompson was that they could do what Dr. Wordsworth asked, but w hat he (Sir H . Thompson) proposed they cunld not accomplish. They could not reform the constitution of thaS os, but they mightappoint this oom - The question was then put, and the motion of Canon Wordsworth was carried by a very large majority. The PrRoLocrron then declared the Convocation pro- roged from that day unt l Wednesday. the 20th of May, On which day it would meet merely to be informed wrhen H ier M Wajesty w rould receive the Addres No business would be done until som0tmeUm afterwards. TheHose ajour adDed abont a quarter-past 3 o'clock. The prayers on Friday were read by the Bishop of Salisbur,and not by the Bev. Joh n Thomas.

The railwaym eetings of the week have presented some points of interesty, and have included several of the French lines. According to the report of the aVest Flanders Company, the available balance will allow a dividend of 3s. 6d. per share, and leave 2411. to be carried forward. The dividend of the Lyons and MIediterranean Company has been declared at the rate of 117f. per share; 30f. having already been distributed, the remainin 87f. will be paid on and after the 15th of Mlay. Thety for the amalgamation wit the Paris and Lyons ha# been ratified, and thoad have been authorized to negotisate the bonds required for meeting th; expenditure on new works. The dividend of the Eastern of France is 54f., which, with the previous amount of 20f., makes the. total 74f, At the Pads and Lyons' meeting the dividend declared was 81f., of which 42f. 40c. is to be paid on the 1st of July. The dividend of the Northern of France Railway is 56f., of which 16f. has already been distributed, leaving 40f. to be paid in July. The principal discussion was in relation to the robberyof shares and bonds, the announcement that de Rothschild have voluntarily consented to sustain the chief loss being received with satisfaction. The report of tbe Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Compsuy has bmen agreed to, and from the present state of the works it is expected that the route from Keith to Malban on the soath end, and from Dalvey to Nairn on the north end, will be-opened in the autumn. The report of the lIverness and Nairn Railway has been confirmed, and the directors have been authorized to apply to Parliament for power to create a preference stock to complete the works and the extension of the line. The disputs between the United States and New Granada regarding the riot which took, place last year on the Panamna route ha arrived at a stage in which a resort to hostilities is imminent. According tothe Newa York advices received this morning a.squadron of 10 vessels of war is forthwith to be despatched to the Itiantic and Pacific coasts of New Granada, seven being ordered to Aspinwall and three to Panama, where already there Is a considerable force. The details of the case are of great importance, and as they have just been furnished by the last number of the official gazette of New Granada, which publishes the entire oorrespondence between the American Commiuioners and the authorities of New Granada, a concise summary of them may be given. It must be premised that the conflict in which the diplomatic controversy orignated occurred in April, 1856, between a body of Californian passengers and several of -the inhabitants of Panam,; that about 18 Americans were killed; that some amount of American property was destroyed or stolen; that the proximate causesof the outbreak were inTolvod in obacurity, each party charging it upon the other; and that the Washington Cabinet immediately demanded reparation, the New Granadian functionaries at Panama having, as wa slleged, assisted instead of restraining the rioters. To obtain a settlement Mes. Morse and Bowlin (the latter being the Resident Munister at Bogota) were appointedCommnis~ioner of the Government of the United States, and on the4th of February last these gentlemen tenderedto theForeign Secretayof New Granada four propositions-namely; 1. That the cities of Panama and Aspingall, should be erected into two municipalities independent and neutral, to goVern themseves, wit h a tirritory 10 miles wine on each side of the railroad, ths United States' Consul beinig empowrered at his discretion to take command of the police of the district or to cal in the navad or military forces of the United States for its proteon; the United States to have the power of modifying or extending the railroad charter at pleaure, and thee exclusive right of granting any ether charter within the district; the nominal sovereignty of New GEranada to remain, and the neutrality and freedom of the transit route to be guaranteed, other nations being invited into the compact. 2. That New Granada should cede to the United States in full sovereignty, for an ample consideration, the twvo clusters of islands in the Bay of Pananna for a naval station; and 3, that New Granada should pay the damages demanded for the late Panama riot; or+4, that this sum should be paid by the United States. These propositions were at once pronounced by tho plenipotentiaries of New Granada to be absolutely inadmissible. It wis urged that they involved "a cession to the United States as complete and gratuitous as it would be unconstitutional and disgraceful of the territory of the State," and auch as no one republic should seek to exact from another; and that so far from preserving to the world the independence of the interoceanic transit they would give an overwhelming influence to the United States, enabling them to exercise a constant control, even bythe medium ofarms. It was at the same time contended that New Granada was not answera4le for the outrage of April, 1856, since it " spraug from the brutal conduct of a citizen of the United States towards a native of the country." Hence the propositions presented could not be admitted even as a basis of discussion. At the same time Nlw Granadawas perfectlywilling to agree to any plans calculated to settle the Isthmus question in a durable and satisfactory manner, so as to give aU nations equal rights and facilities, especially if they could be adjusted under the friendly intervention of " those Powers that are principally concerned in the freedom, equality, security, and facilityof thetraiit." In reply to this communication the United States' Commissionersannounoedthatitwoiildprobablybring theirmisaiontoa very speedy termination andindace the necessity of some other arbitrament. In order, however, to relieve themselvesof theresponsibilities that must follow they felt it necessary to recapitulate the efforts that~ had been made to induce the Government_oE New Granada to listen before cutting off all hopes of negotiation. Tho President of New Granada had declared to Congress and the world that theGovernment of theRepublic " did net and would not hold themselves responsible for the massacre of American citizens and the plunder of more than half a-million of dollars of American property," although they were unable to justify this M ourse by anything beyond "heary" and ridiculous evidence, -vhile the United States, on the contrary, had collected an immense amount of testimony. The French Consul, indeed, had been quoted, but his evidence commenced with a statement which showed its negative character, and which would have caused him to be ordered to stand aside " by any justice of the peace who had ever opened a single law book." The opinions of Mr. Perry, the Enflih Consul, were equally without weight, since he ad sought to " excuse or justify the murderous assault uponwomenrandchildren most complacently saying, 'Duo allowance should be made for the state of excitement on the part of the populae from the constant -acts of brutality they have received from the lower class of California passengers."' The whole case of New GraMd, in the opinion of the Commissioners, was, in short, utter'y worthless.; and, in refusing to negotiate under zhese circumstances, the Republic must accept the responsibility of forcing the United States to take into their own hands the adjustment of the indemni y and the means and measure of redres. The rejoinder to this on the part of the New Grana- lian planipotentiaries umported-- to exoain AU there bad been no desire to del an adjumuiit r that the strong ground of the Goyerhmit imk denying all liability for the oourrene of Ap:i, 1856, was not taken until after the President of the United States had in an equally unqualified mansuprejudged tho whole question in amessage to the-American Congreas, in which it was proclaimed f& tho world that New Granada was responsble forthe assassinations and robberies commnitted upon., citizens of the United States. Moreover, the. proofs of irresponsibility collected by New Graada Were not only sufficient, but conclusiveand uniiipeachable. it was also pointed out that New Granada had not closed the door on all further negotiation simply by declaring the propoutions firit made to be inadrissible, especially as those -propositions by involving the surrender of islands Within gunshot of PanAma would have plaoed that, city, as well as all the principal coimunications of the republic, under the preasion, of the land and se forces of the UnitedStates. Further, it was urged that the sale of tenitory and the tranfer of citizens to a foreign xule' would be infamous and unoonstitutional, and that. in desrinsg an ad4inmoent under theparticipation. of other Powers New Granadahad tkea sooureia which deserved to be well appr,eciated. the causes. of the riot were then entered into, and it 's explained that "the inhabitants of Panama were predisposed against the Californian em*igrtion 4nD account of its generally brat behaviour, and St 'o more predisposed against the new species of adveaturers, whose breeding-place, whose recruitipg: station, whose arsenal of resources, who ai Soint, and whose poit da,ppui are the Unit and who have imProved and brought anse* uponthescenetheancientEflibuaterissuL"Underthese, circumstances, "a party of Californian Fibustets. lands at Panama, not being able to disembaik ix.. Nicaragua; then the train arrives from Colon withi some hundreds of the dreaded passengers or emi. grants, and one of these savages outrages a native fires a pistol at another without any justifiable cause, and is supported and proteced by those of hi& arty." It was also asserted that the authorities *id not neglect their duty, and that thu ixproved& by the testimony of the Consuls ofimisdor, xrancr. England, and Peru. The allegations as to thenumber killcd and -wuncTed, and the property destroyed, were likewise said to have been great exaggerations. Finally, the plenipotentiDes pointed: out that, immediately after the occurrence, a plan. was formed " by several hot annexionists orspeculators for tergiversating the facts to the prejudice of New Granada," and expresod a_ trust that the United States have acted el under erroneous impressions, that they do noti entertain any illwill to New Granada, andthat they will still support the idea of a negotiation between, the two Governments and those of England and France which may lead to a complete guarantee of the safety and freedom of the interooenic routeupon the basis of-perfect uality for all nations. Upon receipt of this the United States Commis. sioners sent in aformal claim for damages amounting to $400,000, and announoed their mision terminated. They could not, they said, see that anyother questions were at issue than those involved in_ the four propositions, and, these being uncondi. tionally rejected, there was nothing further forconsideration. With regard to the proposal of a, joint action with other Powers, theyr added that it was "not within their instrctions to enter upon any new base of negotiations in which England, France, or any othernations. of the world are to decide what guarantees aresufficient for the safety of the property ancd lives of: American citizens." The correspondence then concluded with a letter from the Government of NewGranada, denying the validi of this demand and putting forward a counter lim for $10,000 fordamages sustained on their side, and also for reparation for a rude protest of the American Consul and "the proved falsity of his official sertions,"W as well as for disrespectfulness on the part, of Commander Bailey, of the American navy. It will be observed that while theaboveparticulars fully explain the existing attitude of the two. countries they throw no light on the merits of the, original dispute, since each party insists upon being judge in its own cause, and asserts that the pro'ofs. in its own favour are conclusive aud unimpheacable. There can be little doubt that the Sp anish race in, New Granada have had much to bear from theconduct of the Californian emigrants, and that, whatever the United State' Commissioners m'ay think upon the point, allowance is to be made forthe effect produced upon a weakand ensitive peopleby the fact of shiploads of Filibusters, well supplied. with ammunition ant money, being regurly aed: openly despatched month by month from the priacipal- ports -of the Union. Nothing of this sort, however, can exempt New Granada from the duedischarge of her own duties, and, as in her treaty with- the raiway vompany she pledged herself to anm efficient protection of the transit, she is bound to,pay -for any default that may be proved to have necurred in that respect, and also to give guaranteesagainst its recurrence. Whether those guarantees. must necessarily involve a oession of territory which! would place the entire republic under the power of the United States, and whether theacceptance of suchcession would be in harmony with the clauws of theClayton-Bulwer treaty, are questions whichhave probably been reconsidered at Vashington by the newCabinet, and which ae therefore, itmay be ummed, not likely to lead to embarrawment, It is desirableto remark, however, on the evidences which each. year presents of the consequences that have arisen. from the conduct of those who in 1852 defeated-the, efforts for the united action, of the commereial classes of England and the United States for pronsoting a joint interest inopening up the coraunicatio26 between the oceans. Had the two countries gonehand in hand each route might have been developed according to its capabilities, and the generalgrowth of the prosperity of Central America might by this time have been one of the happiest features. of the age. The results of neglecting t;he opportunity were plainly predicted, and we now seNicaragua devastated, New C Granada about to be attacked, and Mexico, while involved in complication concerning theTehuantapec grant, in constant apprehension of further dismemberment.

THE SALMON FISHBErES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The destruction of young fry of the salmon, to whEich your correspondents, MIessrs. Esdaile, Ayrton, and Benthall, direct public attention in your columns, is undoubtedly greatly to be lamented. There is, however, a means of correction open 'which, if put into practice, wil1 do much to prevent the wanton destruction of this princely fish. Mr. Benthall, in citing the Acts of Parliament bearing on the subject, entirely overlooks the mnore recent law comn molly called "Bailey's Act," 6th and 7th of Victoria, chap. 33, 'which was introduced by the late member for Here. fordsbire at the instance of the Wye lisheries Association established in that county, but which isapplicabloto I English rivers. That statute enacts, that no person shall upon any pretence whatever take, kill, or destroy, or have in possession, or sell, or offer, or expose to or for sal; any spawn, fry, or brood of fish, or any unsizeable fish, or any mod ealinon; and tho Act authorizes any person to take and seize all or aty such spawn, fry, or brood of fish, &c., togtther with the basket or package in which the same may be found, and to deliver the person on whom they may be found to a constable; and, on conviction, the offender is liable to the forfeiture of the fish and basket, &o., in which they may be found, together with a sum not exceeding 101. nor less than 51, and in default of payment to imprison. mnent, with hard labour, for a term not exceeding four months nor less than two montha. I repeat, therefore, that the law is ample to punish offenders of the claas pointed out by Dr. Esdaile, it he or the authorities will only put it into practice. In this city no such fish are ever offered for sale, the inhabitants well knowing that if they were found in possession of them they wo-uld be prosecuted under the above Act. The difficulty of procuring new laws on the subject, such as are necessary to the due protection of the salmon, is far grcater than may be imagined, as I know from experience the association of which bave the honour to be Secretary baving on several occasions made the attempt, but failed on account of the coLflicting interests to be combated with, and in my opinion no suitable measure will be passed unless introduced by the Government. I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant. 'lE,Uf yt;59 .S O . unec. to the Severn Fisherie. Associaltion. Worcester, May 9.
'CHOCKIrrG ACC1DENT.-About 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon an necident occurred on the London and llorthWestern Railway, at the coal-yards crossing, near the passenger station, Fishergate, Preston, by which a woman named Jane Waddington was instantaneously deprived of life. The unfortunate wornan was returning home, having two bundles of rod iron she had been purchasing for her husband, who is a blacksmith, in one arm, and an infant in the other. She was accompanied by a woman, and when on the point of crossing the line to go into Dock-street a coaltrain came up from a siding and proceeded towards the tunneL The women waited until the last waggon had passed, and were crossing the line, when a luggage-train, whiich had been hidden from their view by the coal-train, emerged from the tunnel in an opposite direction. One of the women succeeded in clearing the train, but the other (the deceased) was caught by the buffer and thrown upon tbe ine, the train passing over her body, bands, and legs, cutting off one of her breasts, and ter.ring away a portion of flesh from various parts of the body. Her infant was thrown forward out of her arms, and was found lying near to her side in the 6 feet space. Beyond being a goao deal shaken the child was not injnred. The deceased was about 35 years old, and has left a family of three children. It is to be hoped for the future safety of the public that the railway authorities vill be compelled to erect a bridge at this sbot, several accidents of a fatal nsture having previously happened by persons having to cross the metals. A more dangerous place for a crossing cannot be conceived, for in addition to the large number of regular trains passing over the line at this point coal-trains are often standing or $hunting. t is stated that the corporation have given their anction to the stoppage of the crossing. No blame is nttributed to the engine-driver, as it was impossible for I him tobhave8topped thetrain and prevented the acodent, I and he had given the usual signal of danger-tbe whistle.

RAIL WAY 1:7jTELLIG.PNR. SAMIiR Awn MRz2. The report of the directors of this company daleSthS the difficulties they bad to contend against in developing tbe trafflc of the line, and more especially of the gusranteed branches, had greatly exceeded their expectations; but they hope the difficult contest in which they have been engaged with the river traffio will soon be less Eevere, and that the company will ultimately reap the benefit of the struggle. The directors think they would Dot be doing justice to thoso immediately engaged in the struggle did they not bear willing testimony to the zeal and perseverence with which the affairs of the company have been conducted in Belgium. The receipts for the half-year ending the 31st of December last anmounted to 30,3971., and the total expenditure to 20.4651. The balance, after adding the proceeds of the Government g_arantee, is applicable to the payment of interest on the debenture debt and preferenca shares, and will leave a surplus of 3S. to be added to the previous balance. The receipts, ss compared with the correspohding six months of 1855, show a decrease of 1,0061, while the expenditure has heen increased by 5761., in order to put the rolling stock in a more efficient state. In this result they had shared tha fateb of the Government railwvays, on which during the same period a considerable diminution of receipts (as compared with the corresponding period of 185) took place. 'The line being as-yet :slhost exclusively , mineral railvay, every fluctuation in trade must necessarly. affect the tffic. The directors regret thiat no resoluton seems to have been yet taken by the French Government with respect to the extension of the Ardennes line to the Begian frontier and its junction with the Sambre and Meuse Railway. lUnti that junction takes p7ace the directors feel that they are doing the best th'ey can, under existing circumstances, to develope the resources of the line, which only then can be considered complete. A pr6position has latelv been made foet a more intimite alliance with the Charleroi and Louvaine Company, and should anything dtfinits result from this negotiation it will be submitted to the proprietors. In the meanwhile the directors-think it not desrble at the present moment to fill up the seat at the board vacated by the resignation of Mr. Crake, as it-is more than probable, in the event of any new arrangement being come to, a new constitution of the board may form part of it. The report of Mr. G. Sheward, the resident director, states that the enines of the company during the half-year bad run 100,993 miles againstI02,557miles at the correspond- ing period of 1855. The trains in the past half-yesr eakried' 77,560 passengers, producing 4,692&, against 67,041 passengers, producing 3,9831.; and 211,972 tons of goods. producing 25,494L, aainst212,020 tons, producing 26,391L,for the same perod in 1855. He had stated on a former occasion that the opening of new lines, such as the Chatelineau and Mori.-lm6 and Charleroi and -Louvaine, would natrally deprive them of sorae of tho traffic should the trade oeotinue ood, and the result had proved that he was right. Trade had declined, and seven blast furnaces had blown out. In 1855 they had carried 179,770 tons of ore; in 1856 151,317 tons; ane' not only had the quantity. carried decreased, bn§, what was of greater consequefice.the distance over the line the rest had been taken was mach shortened. Thus, while the former year gave an average of 2s. lid. for each ton, the latter gave anaverage of Is. 8d. only. Although the difference in the tonnage was 28,453 tons only, in the receipts it amounted to 5,5261. Every effor' had been made to compensate for this faling off by an increase in the coal trade. The quantity of coal carried in 18.55 was 125,649 tons, producing 15,9701. ; and in 1856, 145,910 tons, producing 18,979C.; while the importation by the lense had fallen off frorn 75,631 tons in 1854 to 67,874 tons in 1856. Tney carried in the latteryear to Vireux upwards of 40,C00 tons, for which they received 7,6561. as the company's qtota, independently of the sums paid by other parties. Nor was this al. Their coal trade amounted to 40,0001. during the year, without making a bad debt. The boats had not only paid their way, but a small orofit had been carried to the sinking fund. A contract had been made with the Belgian Government Railway and the Northern of France Company for reduced rates between the Liege coal district and Vireux. The construction acconut showed that 3,082,8471. had beon received and 1,085,2421. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 2,395W. The revenue account to the 31st of December. shovred a total of 30,7001., including 16,5131. from the preceding account, 9,931U. net traffic, and 3,8051. Government guatantee On the other side, alter deducting interest on loans and preference shares, nud other charges, there remained a balance. of 16,8591. for the next account to the credit fo revenue. NEWPORT, ABERGAVENNY, AND HEREFORD. The Crumlin Viaduct, on this company's Taff Vale Extension Line, is nearly completed, and, if approved by the Gnvernient inspector, will be opened for traffic on the Ist ,f June. On Thursday last a series of experiments were made by the engineers and contractors with a -iew to testing the stability of the structure prior to submitting it to the examination of the Government officer. Six of the largest engines, with their tenders loaded for the purpose, were brought from Hereford under the direction of Mr. Jones, of the locomotive department. Soon afterwards MIr. Gordon, of the firm of Liddle and Gordon, engineers for the lne; Mr. Care, resident engineer; Messrs. Kennard, E. Sayer, and Mr. Kidd, manager, 'Cramlin Works, also arrived it the spot, and atonce proceeded with the experiment. They fir.ttook two engines over the viaduct at a slow pace, and it was found that themaximum deflection was less than half an inch. They next pased over with four engines, two abreast, when the greatest deflection observed was somewbut less than an inch. The whole six engines with their tenders, each of which was made up to the weight of 52 tons, were then stretched across one of the arches, and afterwards changed, so as to stand two abreast in the centre. In this pmion they remained for some time, when the greatest deflection observed was found to be only IlIth of an inch I In the various experiments whioh followed similar results were realized. An engine then passed over the bridge at the rate of 10 miles an hour, for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of oscillation, which was stated to be scarcely perceptible. The engines were selected in preference to a train of trucks or carriages for the experiment in consequence of their compactnees and weight rendering them more adapted for such a purpose. The six engines, when standing in the position mentioned, gave an amount of weight on the bridge which was believed to be far greater than would, under almost any circumstances, be placed upon it, and at the same time did not exceed one- fifth of the weight which the structure was capable of bearing. The result of this severe test was considered higbly satisfactory by the engineers and contractors. The Crnmlin Viaduct is 200 feet in height, and is stability will of course bh tested by the Government Inspector prior to opening the extension line for public traffic.

P}Ns OF TIIE Nzw OsFTcEs.-The designa for the new Government offices have now been visited by thousands during the week, and it is universally admitted that of its kind it is the most ertraordinary collection tbat has for many years been brought before the public. Now that the public have had an opportunity to view the designs, the names of the commissioners selected to act as judges are given, and it wiU be generally admitted that a better or a fairer selection could not have been made. The judges are:-The Duke of Buccleuch; Mr. Stirling, M.P. for Pertbehire; Lord Eversley, the late Speaker of the House of Commons ; Earl Stanhope, president of the Ro!al Society of Archltects; Mr. David Roberts, B.A., Mir. Burn, R.A., and Mr. Brunel, the eminent engineer. The Duke of Buocleuch is reckoned among the best judges of architecture in the kingdom. He will represent the House of Lords. Mr. Stirling, the selected of the House of Cumnmons, is wel known for bis proficiency in all that appertaina to architecture. Lord. Eversley has been chosen from his long official knovledge, which wiiU enable him to judge what are the principal requisites forGovernment offices. Earl Stanhope, as president of the Royal College of Arhitects, should be considered as being one of the best qualified to give a soand opinion. Er. Danid Boberts is an artist of great eminence. MIr. Bnra is a Scotch architect of high standing, and a member o£ the Institute of Architects;* and Mr. Brunel is well known as being one o the first, civil eegmeer3 of any country.- Obsevs.e a YSEROU OF PoXso NG.-An extraosdznary case of poisoning, which placed in jeopardy the lives of six persons, took place in Cornwall A few days ago. It appenas that a servant in the employ of Mr. Francis Lugg, sen., cabinetmaker of Penzance, named Catherine Ricbards, purchased Slb. of floar of Mr King, aad some yeast of Ann Brewer, who had procured it at Treaver's biewery. The flour and yeast were put into a pantry, and shortly afterwards the servant converted it into loaves of bread. Mr. Lugg and a female assistant, named Trevely'an, ate a small portion of the bread for dinner, and were immediately afterwards 'taken ill, but not seriously. For tea, Mr. Lugg, his son, Mr. Francis Lugg, Miss Trevelyan, and tbe Eervant, Catherine Richards, ate a large quantity of the breAd, and soon afterwards all four of therm wereseized with violent pains in the stomach followed by vomiting. A medical man was called in and medicmes were administered which had the desired effect. Some' of the bread was subniitted to Dr. Montgomery, who analyzed it. in the meantiine a workman ia the employ of Mr. Lugg and one of his apprentices tasted the bread and suffered severely fer their -temerity.. Dr. Montgomery founa th'e whole of the bread highly charged with arsenic, but it appeared that the largenesa otthe dose caused a speedy vomit, and tbus saved the six live awbich might otherw have beensacribedi Flour from t'e same sack and, yeas from the same vessel were sold to other oustomers, who used it without 'ay iainonVtnienci or iniurxy.

STA2 E OF TAADE. M&NCEESTER, MAy 9. With an advanoing cotton-market there is an absence of demand for cloth, which renders it difflcult for sellers to maintain even the inadequate and unremunerative rates recently current. This is an unsatisfactory state of thin for producers, who will probably be driven further to limIt production unles an improvement soop takes place. A slightly better inquiry has existed for yarns from the continent in low to medium counts of mule aind water twist, with rather firmer prices, but in most other descriptions of. yan the market is heavy, with quotations rather in favoDr of the buyer. Cloths of most deecriptions meet with little de. mand. In some fabecs there is an accumulation of'sto.k, but in the lighter printing cloths there is a moderate busi- BIRMNGHAZ, MArs 9. There has been no material alteration in the state of the. iron trade during the past week, but prospects are improving and prices are firmly maintained. Most of the farname are in full work and the make of pigs is represented to be extremelyacive. The brass foundry business, owing to the continued reluctance of many of tl:e principal houses to purchase copper extensively at even the late reduction of quotations, is generally slack, but in some branches, such as cabinet.work considerable activity prevails. ' ' The manufacturers of tin-wares of all descriptions am busy, more especially upon foreign orders. At Wolver. hampton similar activity prevails in this department of local trade, and at Walsall the saddlers' ironmongers, considering the comparatively small amnount of military work now on hand, are morethan ordinarily brisk. The railway carriago and waggon manufacture, which in the course of a few years has become a most importaut source of employment in BirmingBham and its immnediate neighbourhood. is extraordinariy animated. Extenaive orders for the East Indies, France, and the chief, railway oompanies ait home are in hand, and create-unusnuAlbustlq ii #be vicinity og the several works in which they are in course of execution. The home trade for genera' irOnmo'hgey .is 'sead- bit not particularly brisk. 'From home of the leading actors v e learn that the orders from the north of England are encouraging; but that, influenced by causes to which we have referred, the demarnd for some descriptions of foundry work continues extremely limited. Do esetil, braziery particu. lar'y is so affected. For grates, stoves, fenders, and fireirons there is but a small call, bis tmisiraybe attributed to the season of tlse yea wqhen inu2dh -e,uiremenbt are usually the smallest, n can least be expected. For the better descrption of papier-mache goods many of the manufacturers are better off for orders Than in the early part of the year; and for pulated articles and first qualities of japannery there IS a considerable de'mand. The foreign orders received during the past week have been, so far as we can ascertain, encouraging. -From Mtelbourne, it iS true, advises have come to hand 'which repre. Eent an excess of British manufactures generally in the Australian markets, but for Birmingham goods the demabd Is steady and decidedly healthy,i not over-aotive. Buyers from Melbourne have visited Binningham within these few days, and somewhat extensive orders have been given oat for numerous articles of local production, fho for jewelry are better than might have been expected, seeing the manner in which Australia was glutted with jewelry by Birmingham speculators only a few years ago, From North America, or rather from the Liverpool housezs trading with that country, considerable orders have recentlybeenreceived for manufactured goods, a nd the Birmingham merchants who have houses at Newv York, Boston, and other townls in the UTnited States, represent theAmerican trade as steady and improvnmg. LEICESTER, MAY 9. The hosiery trade continues dull, more especially for the bome market. In the foreign trade there is also very little doing. The same inactivity pervades the trade at Loughborough, Hnekisey, and the country districts. The worated mills are still making short time. Skin combinsg woolss are rather easier. Hosiery manufacturers are accumulating ass little stock as possible. LEEDS, M.&Y 9. There has been a rather better feeling in both cloth-hals this morning, and more business done than on this day se'nnight. Several moderate parcels of goods were removed from the halls after the market, having met with purchasers. The weather was warm and seasonable, and there appears ground now to anticipate an acceleration in the demsnd for light fabrics, the sale of which has not yet been brislr. All parties in the wooUlen trade are acting with caution, and pnces are in an uncertain state, arising in a measure from the lightness of the money-market and the fall in the price of wool. Probably the trade will improve when the present series of sales in the mnetropolis are condaded. Few now believe that there is ay immediate prospect of a further reduction in the cost of wool. HALIFAX, MAY 9. Trade has been rather dull, nor is there any decided improvement in the market to-day. Perhaps upon the whole it has been a little better than Ilst Saturday's. Wool, worsted, and yarns are unaltered in price, or, if there be any change at all, it is a slight decline. Ooburgs and Orlesns have been more inquired for. BRADFORD, M&Y 9. There is little alteration to report in the state of the worsted trade. The general tone of this department is slightly improving. From the late extreme delness there have not been many buyers in the town, but business has perceptibly increased by orders which, although individually small, are in the aggregate tolerably extensive. The tramnactions ar inthe heavier descriptions of pieces suitab'e for the autumn trads, as the cold unseasonable weather still experienced preventb business being done in the lighter goods adapted to summer wear. At this ason the American bouscs are usually in a state of much activity; at the present time, however, this important branch of trade is extremely flat. The stocks In the warehouses are light, as the prices realized for the raw material, both wcol and cotton, or some time past have precluded making stock on speculation. Manufacturers ta ke the precaution to limit the production by reducing the quantity of machinery in use, and short time is resorted to in the majority of the mills. The yarn trade is slack. Transactions in worsted yarnsI either for shipping purposes or home consumption, are limited; contracts are prevented by an impression that wool must give way in price, and thus release spinners from the difficulty they have long experienced It is unquestionable that a very large proportion of spinning machinery is now unemployed, and that the rate of production is very far below the averago at thisseason. The wool-market is inactive. There is a quiet business in combing descriptions, purchases bein to the extent requisite to supply the imnmediate wants of the trade, and prices are noteasier. The firmness of boldwers, whose stocks are not heavy, has the effect of keeping transactions within a moderate lmit. Clothing wools ind a healthy inquiry; the quantity of noils nd brokes on offer iscurtailedby the diminished production, and the supply is purchased at steady rates as brought to market. NORWICH, MAr 9. The monthly circular of the London, Norwich, nd Northampton Boot and Shoe Company states that the workmen engaged in the business in Norwich are obtaining higher wages than were ever before known, and that this prosperity is likely to last, as the demand for Norwich goods is on the increase. The trade, which is growin in imfortance, is reported to be'en the whole in a healthy condition.

. FATIOXAZ ARNFqRM..f ORY UNXOy. On Saturday after.oon a meeting of the members of the National Reformatory Institution. took plase at No. 3. Wzteiloo.place, There was a numerous attendanMc, aa- among those present were-Earl Stanhope, the Ron. Mr. Iadde, 3SP., Mr. M1onckton Milnes, hP., fr. MEIes, MI P., Sir Ca Nicholson, Sir HEarry Verney, MEr 15. D). Ipawich, Mr. Bfowyer, the Rev. Sydney. Turnr, and manyother gentlemen having the management of Reforeatory institutions. The Hon.- Mr. Liddell wscalled to the A letter was read from X- Do Motz, the manager of the Reformatory Institatioli at Mettray,.in 3rance, who is now on a visit to this country, regretting his. inability to atten& in consequence of domestic affliction. Mr. GsDsrons~ said the chief object of the meeting ,wa to hear a suggestion from .`D a Metetz as to the propriety of ewblishing a normal school in this'country fo re fonrm tory schoolmaters; mdi. truited that the society would: talce that subiect into co6nsderathn, and coimmunicast rith the Cornnitteetof EddieatiozktV(the Privy Council upon it. -The qualifications fr .reformatoy yEhoolmseras laid doin by the mite bf the Privy Council were much, too high, aind -the coznsequefice was that the 2ort of men that wss-resUlt eAuired at such institutions conld not be oht,ined.. He moved that adepuatihon of the societyv shonldL ait upon the Vice-President of the Commnittee of Edeca. tioni tto express the views they entertined upon tha- sbC> V.gyDw Tl7RSuiR said the sphere from which masters could at present be taken was much too limited, and he should like to see it thrown open, so that all who might feel qualified for the task shonid be allowed to bave a month on probation in soine trgung institution. As he had already ad a private interview with Mr. Cooper, of the Priv Conucil-o9ice, on the subject and was to see him agaha in a few dayn, he thought -that it would be more advisablae to apPoint a comiittee, and leave the matter in their After some discussion-this was agreed to, and a committee h d loscxroyMn.iSr, M.P., said that he had recently hadsome conversation with Sir George Girey on the saubject of the Reformatory Bil he had brought before Parliament last session, but had withdrawn, and he had expresed a wish to meet the members of that institution to ascertaLm what their objections, to the measure were, as they had assed a resolution to the effect that it was objectionable. He (Mfr. Monkton MAilnes) believed a deputation had b2an appointed for this p e before the Bill was withdrawn andl would only carrying out unow what was propose= to be done then if the measure had been pressed on. He therefore moved that a deputation ehould wait upon Sir George Grey, as suggested. They might perhaps be able to conneto an understanding with him on the subject. ,Mr. ls, hMP=% A. as so anxious to see the Bil brought forward that e had given notice that he should put the guestion whether or not it would be brought- in to Sir George Grey on Monday evening in the House of Commons; and if the reply was in the negative he was authorized to ay- that a similar Bill would be brought in by Mr. Beckett The motion having been seconded, Mr. M. D. HILL said he was strongly opposed to the course proposed. The resolution come to by the society ore the merits of theBill might be open toquestion,and beforeit was acted upon farther it wasdes7rable thlataother meetin should be held upon the snuiect, ashe know maDy friends o the reformatory movement who were in favour of the BilL He himself was strongly opposed to it. Heobjectedto the permissive power of rating counties for the maintenance of rdformatory institutions, as being bad in principle. The success of these institutions in this and other countries was entirely owing to the fact that they were maintained voluntarily, and their failure had been in proportion to the inter. fdrence with them by the State. It was impossible that two such opposite principles could exist at the same time as that 'they shoud be supported by rate where the magistrates chose to say so, and that if they declined to make such a rate, then their support must be voluntary. A considerable discussion ensued, in whichb the chairmxan, hir.. Sydney Turner, 3Ir. Miles, Mr. D. Power, and others took part, after wvhich The Hon. R. CAserxross-noved that a joint meeting of the Lss<Ainndmnent Society and that institution should: he held on the subject. Mr. D. Powss seconded the motion, wrhich was carnied. The proceedings then terminated. .~ ~ ~ O

The will in dispute Wa that of the late Mr. ~Richurd Simpson, of ull,X timber merchant, and the hn quiry excited considerable interest from the fact that the property at stake amounted to from 60,0001. to 70,0001. There was also this novelty in the proceedings-that the witnesses were examined vive voce, in accordance with the new Ast of Parliament in reference to business in Boclesiastical Courta. By his will the testtor bequeathed about 17,0001. in legadels, and the residue he left to the three de-fendants-Mesmra Garbutt. Gray, and Maples, who were not relations in blood to him.

LONDON, MONDAY, MAY U, 1857. 1 . _ The cynical may feel diBposea to allege that universal brotherhood is one of the calita of the day. [ We not only have humanitarian congrese and displays of universal industry, but we make war on the same priuciple, and go to fight the Ohiueae in the character of associated international philanthropists. Yet, however much we English draw near to any continental nation in policy, whatever of sympa ty, or admiration, or confidence we msy bestow on the various races with whom our geographical position links us, we cannot help feelingthat between us and them there is a great gulf fixed The Straits of Dover roll between two worldg. It is no exaggeration to say that in manners, in habits of thought, ini aims, ideas, and aspirations, there is less difference from Lisbon to Vienna than there is between those little seaports of Kent and Picardy which are able to watch nightly each others harbour-lights. We 3ake alliances with our continental neighbours, we pay them comapliments, -we go among them in crowds, we fill their hotels and theatres, we -buy their.manufactures, we read their bQoks, and yet the influence is almost nothing. When the traveller comes back he throws off foreign habits just as he gets rid of his napoleons and franc-pieces. Morally, socially, politically, in business and amusement, in hopes and achievements, we are strictly national and a people apart. The converse is equally trae; if we talke little from our neighbours, they seldom model themselves on . our standard. Representative Chambers controlled by artillery and a public press tempered by the police are the forms in which our chief institutions are found abroad, and beyond these we meet with little that- is English on our travels, except an occasional parody of a steeplechase or a cattle show. But, in recompense for this, Britain has created a world of its own, which is rapidly rising into an equality with that European syatem which has its centre of thought and influence at Paris. Language, law, and literature form the chief bondsc between sections of mankind, and these, in spite of political differences,differences of climate, and differences from the 'internixture of foreign blood, will always unite the people of the Anglo-Saxon stock. The United States are the home of a race whicn, in spite of many external and some internal diversities, is one with our own. Climate may change the physical type and make the children of the broad-shouldered emigrant into a lithe and slender race of more nervous activity than muscular power. The brightness of the sky and the dryness of the air may encourage a more out-ofdoor life and a frseer social intercourse than prevail with us. Finally, the large ir.- fusion of foreigners, and the spirit of imitation which belongs to a new people, may have introduced some of the continental manners and habits. But stil the substance of the two nations is the same, and in the great works of government, colonization, or territorial extension the resemblance between the mother and daughter is sufficiently striling. EIow, then, should not advancing intelligence lead to a better feeling between the two countries ? If England find in the development of the United States, as well as of her own colonies, the surest means of establishing a world-wide influence and a great historical position; if the Americans learn to recognize, in spite of the calumnies of ignorance and malevolence, that England has been for centuries, and stil is, the only supporter in the Old World of fhe principles which make mankind happy and worthy of happiness; if they perceive that this Dountry, after fighting battles from which other communities- would have sbrunk, after slaying Iragons in the shVe4of every kind of abuse and injustice which- have brooded amid the larknezs of the past, has, in spite of a aarrow territory, debt, and pauperism, taken % new start in: the world, and made. a progrews of late y*A% 'which even the States can hardly surpass, rely there are reasons why mutual respect and good-will should take the place of bitterness and distrust. On these grounds we cannot help expressing our stisf ction at the speech of Lord NArans, at the Bt. George's Society, New York, as given in our uinpression of Saturday. On responding to the toast of " Hu M TAY-'s Ministers and " Representatives on the American Continent," Lord N&PrE expressed himself in language which is considerably above the average of diplomatic, and even of Parliamentary eloquence. As the toast itself was of unusual courtesy, our Minister did not confne himself to the formalities of official banqueting,' but told his hearers in warm terms of the pleasure which his Government, his countrymen, and himself felt in the belief that old causes of dissension and dislike were passing away, and that the future promised well for the unity and mutual regard of the two peoples. It is now more than 40 years since the last war, and the settlement of recent disputes shows that with common good feeling and forbearance there is no reason we should ever have another. The Maine boundary, the Oregon boundary, the Canadian disturbances, the fishery dispute, have all been arranged without a resort to hostilities; and Lord NAP=n might well say that " we have in the experience of the past the best "C grounds for believing that there can never be a " question so difficult or complicated that it "may not meet with a prompt, a peaceful, and "honourable solution." Nor did the speaker less represent the feelings of his countrymen when he declared that no class of Englishmen looked with jealousy on the expansion of the Union and the increase of its inhabitants. Some such feeling may have had an exitence in the last generation, when the memory of our feuds was fresh, and when it was the plan of even well-informed statesmen to raise up in the Spanish race a barrier against the predominance of our supposed rivals. But in English society at the present day we can trace no remains of this feeling. In the first place, we have learnt that no Spaniards or other continental people are capable of holding their own against the energy and enterprise of a nation of Anglo-Saxon blood, and to suppose that the Anericans can be arrested by a set of Spaniards and half-castes is to suppose that the laws of nature can be set aside at the bidding of the politician. Hence, if even any jealousy still existed, common sense would teach us its uselessness and absurdity. But, as Lord NArun justly observed, the feeling of Englishmen is rather one of pride and gratification that in so signal a manner and by a course of events which our fathers judged calamitouls our language, laws, history, and institutions should be made the heritage of a new world which is gtowing up to such high destinies. We may trust, then, that with a more complete appreciation of each other's part in the world former animosities will die-away, and that, while we look with satisfaction on the legitimate extension of the Republic's power in the New World, the American will see with equal good-will the development and increasing greatness of the British Empire. There is certainly room enough for both when each has a hemisphere. Long may it be, then, before the friendship of the two nations receivea an interruption. If any one were to ask vwby it is that of late days there has sprung up in this country so favourable a feeling towards the UJnited States, we should be inclined to answer that one of the chief reasons is the utter failure of Liberal institutions and -what we may cal English ideas on the continent of Europe. 1,l despair or in disgust we have turned from the contemplation of those countries where our political usages have been copied only to be made ludicrous or revolting. The events of the last 10 years have taught us how little comparatively these nations have in common with us, and have drawn closer the bonds which unite u5 to a kindred peopI3 without whom we should be alone in the world.
The Dean of Sr. P!Azo's has made a good use of his position as a neutral and moderate man to move the Convocation with a view to obtaining the discontinuance of the three political services in the Prayer-book. It serves to mark that singujar state of things in which a sensibIe aud reforming Legislature is content to let the Church of Tngland remain, that here, on a matter of real importanco, is enacted a farce in which nobody knows what he is, or what place or office he has in the matter. Convocation, we need hardly remind our readers, is a visionry body-a mere Church debating society,-without power to do anything but talk as long as the COnwx will lot it talk. Such is the body which takes the lead in this affair. The authority which tho Doan proposes to move is the CnowVN; but, as tho CRowr only proceeds in complianco with v usagO of many generations and an Act of Parliament, anl a the order for these services is one of the gers, monies of every Aocesion, no Minister who wiU4 to keep his head on his shoulders would do Any| thing in the matter without a Parliameatary t- pensation. Such, then, is the power to be moved by Convocation. When we como to the matter Itself we find three services of a highly political character, as unsuited to the genius of England in tho nineteenth contury as tho canonization of TioxrAs A'BwxETr at Canterbury, or the apotheons of JASr L on the ceiling of Whitehall Chapel. We had almost added that the services are disuwsd; but in these days, when men are found to do the inost singular things, and there is an imenee toleration of hobbies which do not interfere with the comfort or the conscience of the pubEc, the services are not wholly disused. They are ued in some places all the more resolutely because they are disused elsewhere, and by some clergymen all the more because they can get no congregation to join in them; but they are practically obsolete, and more than obsolete-exploded,-utterly consigned to the limbo of ancient bigotry, hypocrisy, and folly. Even of our most religious readers not one in ten was ever present at the use of these services, except on a Sunday, when, If they were used, they were seriously curtailed, or only used. to shock the feelings of the congregation. Politics, of coure, will lead to any absurdity, anyprofanation; but it is an affair of faction, not of religion, when at the same moment HighChurchmen at Oxford are denouncing a service, High Churchmen at DubEn insisting on its use, and Low Churchmen or no Chnrchmen also taking contrary sides to suit the locality. The religion of the services has long expired, and they really have no more right to remain in a Prayer-book put into the hands of eveky child, and used every Sunday in every parish in the country, than the old service for " Touching for " the King's Evil." People get so accustomed to what they let alone, and what gives them no trouble, that they will not even exercise their reason or judgment upon it; but let an English Churchman just open his eyes, shake himself, and dispel the pleasant fancy that last occupied his dozing mind, and think what these three services really are. They relate entirely to a dynasty of unhappy memory which England only tolerated for three generations, and which is a byword among us for its follies, its vanities, and its vices In thee services we thank the Ansnnrv for sparing the life of a Sovereign whose mother and whose son we beheaded, and for restoring to the Church of England a Sovereign who turned out the most licentious reprobate that ever sate on this throne. In one of these services we at the same time and in the same breath thank the ALmranrr for delivering the Royal Family from its enemies, and with equal fervour thank somebody ele for delivering the nation from the said Royal Family. The levity and inconsistency of these so-called religious acts are only surpamed by the violence and vulgarity of the language, which is sometimes so bad as to be mistaken for the coarser kinds of cursing and swearing. "Hellish malice" and " bloody enemies?' are only specimens of the flowers of rhetoric used in these appeals to the AmTIWisE and ALL-GooD. Indeed, if the clergy of England could reconcile their minds and their lips to the profanation, they could easily get the services put out of the Prayer-book by all agreeing to use them till the congregation took the matter into their own hands. The simple fact, however, is that the services are not used, except when either some young clergyman anxious to do everything according to law, or some old fanatic anxious to puph the law, inflicts on his congregation what he knows will disgust them, and what he rather likes for that reason. A ready test presents itself for discerning the spirit of these documents. Let anybody with the most ordinary power of elocution-that is, with a heart, and with lips that can expres the emotions of that heart-just attempt to read through these services in the same tone as that in which he would naturally offer up his ordinary prayers to the Throno of all Grace; he wll immediately find himself involved in as hideous a mockery as if he were to try to read in a devotional tone the blasphemies, atrocities, aud vulgarities which occasionally occur in our police reports, and which we only give because the trath must be known. In fact, these are political philippics of the lowest character, such as even the least educated Chartist would now.vhave the taste to avoid; yet, as Acts of Parliament and Orders in Council n;ow stand, the whole nation is to address this sort of stuff to our Cuniron and RneDEMzal To guard ourselves from any misconstruction of our motives, we beg to say that we yield to no one in gratitude for the political events commemorated in these servi6es, and, in one sense, admit that the particular act of beheading CHAnLEs I. was a great crime. The mere circumstance that it proved a great blunder leaves no doubt on that point. We gladly adopt the usual commentary on the events of that period, and hold that it was scarcely a national act, but an act of violence to the national feelings. No reasonable man, let alone his religion, can doubt that the success of the Gunpowder Plot would have been a dreadful calamity, and that even the profligate reign of CHA IL was a less evil than the anarchy which was the other alternative. B3ut when, after these ins and outs, these fasts and feasts, these sins and deliverances, we wind up with thanking HEnIvzr for ridding us of the STruiRTs altogether, it is natural to look to the balance, and aecommodate our feelings to the result. No doubt, the story of the STuABTs is one of the most interesting in the British annals, and we are pleased to remember that Queen VicToxuA herself is a STUAnT, though happily filtered through a very different medium. But we hate unreality-that is, insincerity and hypocrisy,-and it is a very unreal thing to pretend to fast and feast stmU for the misfortunes and escapes of a family that existed two hundred years ago, and which was finally driven from our soil, as its politics were effaced from the book of the Constitution. If we no longer feel much about these remote and questionable affairs, it is only a mechanical movement of the lips and an affair of names and dates to offer up prayers and thanksgivings ab,out them. -Ioreover, we have other ins to answer for and to repent of,-other deliverancea and blesings more present and more our own to thank Hzavzx for. These demand the concentration of our feelings, -which are too valuable to be wasded onx Mue his- I torical recollections, not to my diSp&ted in ge by controversies. The xamG P'rovidence which a, spiglly displayed itslf on thow disnt ooeio., works to this day in our favour as effectuuy ,a aometimes as sign.lly. It is a matter of common Sense to apply our feelings to the subtantial realities thss sumrround us, and touch us and our friends; th&t are mixed with our most private affirs, and whos inues run far inlo the future. We do not forget or disparage the past, but the present-the present is that which has most claims to our interest; and would that it were, indeed, the public as well as the private habit of this nation to bring its religion to bear on its present duties and its future prospects 1We have a world of things to be done, and for our own part we are religious enough to feel that HBIThvm may still help us through them. This in a real and serious consideration;but it is only an hypocrisy, a distraction, and ua iJclimbraue to divert xuch feelings from the pro. Reut hour and its dutie, to a particulr period of our Annals, as it happens, le similar to tlt prmealt thAe any other page of English hitoy
The clergymen of the Estern perishes of the metropolis who formally brought before Mr. Bouvznrg on Wednesday lst the deplo&able condition both of the ratepayers and the poor in those needy and overcrowded districts wee at any rate entirely succesful in demonstrating their claims to the most attentive consideration. We are under no necesity of reciting or explaining the aircumstances oh which this application was based, as our readers havo seen the sub. ject considered in these columns fronmvariouspoints of view for some time past. The simple proposition that every something or other should support its own poor is one to which no objection would be made from any quarter whatever. The whole controversy now pending turns on the definition or dimensions which this "something or other" should receive. What limits, shape, or form ought to be asigned to the area or dirict cbarged withl the levies in question? The division has been hitherto talken by parishes, and naturally so too; in fact, such an arrangement presents in theory certain obvious recommendations. A parish would contain its proportion of all classes of people, both rich'and poor; being administered by its own officers, and under- the care of its own clergyman, it would form an independent comunuity within itself, ad wlhat more fitting, therefore, than that its poor should be relieved by those who, on the one hand, were most cognizant of their necesities, and, on the other, had the most direct interest in avoiding extravagance, inasmuch as they were dealing with their own proper funds ? Al this may be plausible enough; but it is now urged that the assumed features of a parish on which theso conclusions were based have in many important instances been altogether obliterated. There are some parishes with far more than their proportion of rich, and others with far more than their proportion of poor; and, what is more to the purpoe, the excess of poor in the latter represents in reality the amount of poverty properlypertaining to the former. The progress of things has tended to drive the poor out of one parish into another, until at last they have become congregated in particular quarters, on which the obligation of maintaining them falls sith tremendous severity, while comparative immunity is enjoyed by othem Especially has this been the case in the metropolis. London contains, as of old, its rich and its poor, but the elements of competence and poverty, instead of being pretty evenly distributed over all parishes alike, have become separately localized, so that, while some districts are almost exempt from taxation, others, and most notably the Eastern . parishes, are crushed with the burden accumulating from the whole. The sufferers desire, therefore, to brng facts again into accordance with theory by treating the metropolis as one parish only. They say that London represents in reality one community; that its poor are the poor of the whole, and not of a part; and that Bethnal-green and Shoreditch, for instance, should no more be specially taxed for the support of these poor, on account of their residence there, than a particular street or bloclc of houses in a parish should be chargeable with the separato maintenance of the desiitute whose abode it happened to be. The course of events, in short, has effaced parochial boundaries for all the common purposes of life and labour, and it becomes therefore a manifest injustice to preserve them for the purpose of rating alone. If,however,theparochiallimitsaretobediw,arde what limits are to be substituted? "'The limits of " the metropolis," says the deputation. But, why stop here? Suppose the metropolis afewyears henoe to demand, on the same grounds and by vitue of the same arguments, the annesation of the adjoining counties; every other city and town might do the same; a metropolitan rate might become a national rate, and after Scotland and Wales had been incor?orated for the same purpoos Ireland might make its proposals too. Then, why not accept these consequences in all their extent ! For this very plain reason-that though the burdens of some ratepayers would be justly lightened, the securities of all would be so utterly detroyed that in a few years' time everyparish in the kingdom might find itself as badly off as Bethnalgreen is now. The excellence of parochial administration consists in the economy which self-interest insures. At present every parish draws upon its own funds; but what would be the case if it drew upon the funds of other people? At present there are urgent and allsufficing motives for frugality and thrift; there would then be motives equally powerifl not only for negligence but for actual prodigality. It would be the interest of every paiah to obtain from the national poor-rate the greatst posible amount 1 for expenditure within its own bounds, and it would be calculated, of course, that tho acquisition of a hundred or two in this way would only be balanced by the fraction of a pound in its owncontribution towards theagepte. It Would be the interest of all tradesmen supplying the poor to supply as much as possible; it would not be the interest of any overseer to check the outlay, or of any guardian to diminish the numaber of applicants ; and, in fact, if such a policy were to prevail in its fullest extent, we hardly kno'w that any man anxious to settle in the world could do much better than establish himself as a confirmed pauper at as early a period of life as posible. It is of no avail to say that all would havo a common interest in exercising economy. Such would be the fact, no doubt, but the benefit derivable from this source would be almost invisible in comparison with the profit arising from expenditure. Fifty pouinds saved would be shared by the whole nationu; fifty pounds spent would be the gain of the parish alone. Possibly these consequences might be mitigated by a supreme administration; but with such an eitablishment would come an immeuse expenditure upon all kinds of functionaries, the destruction of that aelf-government which everybody de4ires. and the expansion of that centralization whieh eierybody deprecates. Rlaving ackiiowltAged this much, however, we must again expres; our conviction that the state of the Easterii parishees calls most imperatively for attentionj anm relief. All the conditions of the case are alctV! aid reacting upon one another, andminaling cn i0i ivqr,o than before. The numbers of the poor itrcase th' rate, the increase of the rates cruses those owrbo uld just k above water, an sends th ain oate xnu bers ofthe poor. Sich a stat. of thngsin the parisLa naturally repels the capital iWh iohight otbisr be brought there, and drives. Over by away who' ha the meani of escaping, until In the ena there' remains only a huge ggregato of poverty, in 'WI'd the absolutely destitute are xuppOtd by Otheew almost as destitute as themselvesv Een this sup-- port can only be inadequately given ancl it 'was shOwn in the interview we have been coDnidaeingx to what painful straits both overnes# and poor ay bo driven. Itwsnot2nerelyimyliedthatthe - rates inthe E:uternparishes miht reach io 10s; 6i 12s. in the pound, instAea of 3m. or 4&. but it waS affirmed that thl, larger amount 'would nt be too much for the adequite xooour, f the applicants; so that the relief actually afforded bas short of sufficiency by something like tWo-thirds. Can nothing, therefore, be done in such & eme t We sincerely trust that the means of cure aiud palliation are both in our power. The cure mu*.> be wrought evidently by a better ditr.ibution, of metropolitau abodes, and by the due provision i]. all parishes for the residence of those poore class who are now driven far away from their work, tot swell the destitution of the only district where the' dwellings they want are procurable. For a more. immediate palliation we may look to union-rating, for, as unions have actually been substituted for parishes iti other departments of this aaministra tion, the same limits ma;y fairly be taken f6r rating too. It 'cannot be tolerated that one pariah should have all the benefit of the labour-market, and another all the burden of the poor-thib m' one a wealthy population should do nothing, and in anotlher a necemitous population should do all

MONES'y OF THE "SUPERIOr CLERGY." TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I have just read your admirable article in Ol paper -nthe aboe subject.

BXHIBITION OF ART TREASRES A? MANOHRST.R. I Cw The Gallery of the Academy of the Belle Arte at Florence still furnishes the best illustration of the growth of Italian art through the 14th and 15th centuriea; the collections at Berlin and Munich remain unrivalled for e.amples showing the development of painting in Germany up to the time of the Reformation. Those who wish to see assembled the greatest number of masterpieces oftheTuscaii school mnst still seek the Uffizi and the Pitti Palaces; nor can theBellinis, Giorgiones, Titians, and Tintorets be yet appreciated uithout study of their works in the churches, the scuole, and the gaUeries of Venice; for ornamental work in ivory, jewels, precious atones, and metals, the KunBt-Kammern of Berlin and Vienna and the Green Vaults ot Dresden still remain the richest repositories. For ilustration of the history of enamelling the Louvre must still be visited; nor will the enthusiast in arms and armour be able to dispense as yet with many a-day's laborious search in the arsenals of Madrid and Venice, and the Zwinger Gallery in the capital of Saxony. In short, the Manchester collection of Art Treasures is not an assemblage of worhs of art and wonders of design unequalled in any one of its many component parts; it cannot even be said to exhibit in aU its branches the masterpieces of each which may be found in the united kingdom, but it is fairly entitled to the credit of presenting compactly, and within compass of even those who cam give but little time to the study of art, a more complete illustration of the history of aU the great EuroDean schools of painting, and of most of the prin. cipal branche3 of design in which art has been applied to the uses of daily life, than can anywhere be found gathered under the same roof; and it opens the way to practical application of the lessons which may be deduced from all its early examples of art and design by placing in juxtaposition with these what modern English art and contemporaxy English design have done, and are doing, to decorate our own walls and minister to our own household uses. When the projectors of this bold and comprehensive umdertaking first communicated with Prince Albert on the sabject of their design the Prince strongly recommended that the collection of pictures should be limited to the old masters. He thought, probably, that the educational object of the design would best be served in this way, and that the public had no need of any other gathering together of contemporary pictures than the annual exhibitions, metropolitan and provinciaL On this point the Manchester projectors differed from his Royal Highness, and, we venture to think, wisely. Neither ancient nor modern art can be thoroughly appreciated apart. Enthusiastic devotion to either, and il-judged contemptfor either, may readily be engendered by exclusive study of one or ofthe other; but appreciation isonlypossible to those who, holding in check their own tendencies, and studiously estimating the objects, advantages, conditions, and applications under and for which the ancient and the modern painter worLed, will be content to study the art of every century, from the 13th to the 19th. Opportunities of doing this by help of anything like a complete and systematically arranged series of examples are so rare that we rejoice that the planners of the Manchester lxhibition did not let slip the chance of adding this, the best and fullest, to the number. There is no other country in the world where it is so possible to gather within the country's own borders the means of effecting this completely, and that, too without trenching on public galeries and national collections. With the exception of some examples of the ceramic art from the British Museum and the Department of Science and Art, and of some arms and armour from the Tower, everything here exhibited comes from the galleries of the Sovereign, or from the collections in private houses. British individualism is impressed on this as on every other manifestation of British mind, and along with this that feature which, individual as we are, links us more closely in nationality than any other people,-British public spirit. The work has been planned for objects nothing less than national. The owners of the rarest pictures and miniatures, of the most fragile treasures in glass, porcelain, and pottery, of the most precious works in gems and gold and silver, of the most curious specimens of cabinetwork, of engravings and etchings, unique and almost priceless, have not secrupled, for a national object, to expose their treasures to the dangers of packing and transport, the rislk of thieves and fire, and the thousand hazards of a crowded exhibition-room. For works of which the money-value may be reckoned in millions, the owners have only required the protection of in. surance to the amount of less than 200,0001. Where contributions have been refused it has been in the vast majority of cases, not from indisposition to contribute, but from the strict stipulations in family settlements forbidding the transfer of heirlooms from the galleries where they are hung. And thus many of the noblest tributes to devotion, of the most gorgeous appliances of wealth and civilization and of the most artistic ministrations to the refinements of life, have found their way to smoky, sooty, steamy Manchester; and for its toiling crowds, within hearing of its never-ceasing dia andwhirl of wheels, under the canopy of its black cloud from innumerable chimneys, arises a temple dedicated tothe beautiful. It was a noble duke, and not aManchester cottonspinner, -who asked the question, when applied to for some of his pictures, "What in the world has Manchester to do with art I" Manchester has to do with art, if only because it is condemned to the most continuous and unlovely forms of labour. It has to do with art because art is a potent means of education and refinement; and without these Manchester cannot continue to prosper, morally or materially. It has to do with art, finally, because MIanchester is the great centre of the manufacturing district of the north, and art is the foundation of design, and design is of the essence of successful manufactures. Before entering upon a detailed consideration of the works here exhibited, we would offer a few suggestions to the committee with reference to the means by which their undertaking may be made most conducive to its best objects. The sooner some plan is devised for admitting the working tbousands to their Exhibition the better. Manchester is one of the few seats of in- dustry in which a Saturday half-holyday is the rule n all establishments. Let the Exhibition, then, be opened on Saturdays at the lowest possible prlce of admission-if 2d. so muchthebetter-fortheworking classes. But for these the contents of the building will be a chaos unless a cheap and compendious guide-book, not a detailed catalogue, be furnished. If thecommittee do notfurnishone themselves, let them select the best from the many which are likely to be produced by independent enterprlse, and give facilities for its sale in the building. Would It not even be possible to provide guides, competently informed, who at stated intervals might conduct parties through the galleries, explaining the nature and relations of their contents t Tho catalogue at present printed is marked "provisional." It is easy. to understand how incomplete the first list of contents of such a collection must almost inevitably be. The non-arrival of some works, the late arrival of ethers, the heavy labour thrown on those charged with the superintendence of de. partments at tho last moment are quite sufficient to account for the incompleteness and disorder which make little better than printers' "pie" of some portions of thle pre2ent catalogue. No time abo, I e lost in setting this to rights. In the-cblffolo- t ical list of old masters appended to the catalogae' of the ancient pictures figures should be introduced referring the repder to the examples of those painters to be found here. To the works of some of the modem. masters whose importance in the history of native art warrants this the dates of production should be appended inthecatalogue. We may instance Lawrence, Wilkie, rnd Turner as cases in poin'. This is particularly required for the watercolour drawinga of the last master, in which the exhibition is so peculiary rich. All visitors who are desirous of profiting by the Exhibition should, of course, begin with the old masters, and study their works as much as possible in the chronological order. The works of the early Italian and German schools are hung in Saloon A, and should bOtalh be exarmined before passing to the later productions of the two countries in the vestibules, Saloons B and C, and Saloon H, to the left, looking towards the orchestra, which contain the Flemish and Dutch masters of the 17th century and a eelection of the choicest ornaments of the Hertford gallery. When this review of art to the plose of the 18th century is concluded the Visitor may pass with better chance of profit to the works of modem English painters, from the predecessors of Reynolds down to the contributors to last year's exhibition of the Royal Academy. The collection of historical portrai.ts, the watercolour gallery, and the unrivalled series illustrative of the history of engrving in all its branches, will each form a separate subject of study. We may mention that it is in the part devoted to this last department of the Fahibition that the provisional catalogue has been left in most hopeleas confusion. It is not till thae pictures have been carefully examined that the illustrations of design in the various branches of glass, porcelain, and pottery, in the ivories, the enamels, the bronzes, the furniture, and the arms and armour here collected can be examined with something like appreciation, for these will be found to reflect in theirrespectivedevelopements, in their beauties to be turned to account, and in their faults and deformities to be avoided, the mutual relation, progress, and decadence of the various schools of painting and architecture. We are writing principally for those who will bring ittle previous knowledge to the consideration of this collection. We must therefore at starting put the visitor on his guard against contempt and hasty irreverence towards the first efforts of painting as he will see them exemplified in the works of the Byzantine and early Italian schools which line the end wall of Saloon A, beginning on his right hand as he faces them. He must bear in mind that modern art took its rise at a time when ancient art had become helplessly and hopelessly degenerate. What it was in its later forms is here indicated by the frgments of ancient fresco contributed by Mr. Dilke, Sir M. W. Ridley, and the Earl of Pembroke. Ancient art had been devoted to the service of Paganism, and many of the most influeatial among the early Christian teachers condemned art altogether, and would, if they could have had their will, have banished it entirely from the service of religion. But the nature of man was too strong for them. The thought would find expresdon in form as well as in words. Admitting this overmutering necessity, the Church, though it could not stifle art, resolved to fetter it. The ravages of barbarian horde3, and the internecine struggles of rude chieftains, had driven the arts to the more peaceful Evast, and Byzantium became the fountain-head of the theorles as well as the practice of painting. The Byzantine Church imposed on the artists who wrought in itj service, and who were generally monks or priests of its communion, the sternest limitations of invention and representation. To this day the Greek Church maintains these limitations. The picture in Greek churches are still executed in precisely the same manner, still retain the same faces, forms, draperies, and attitudes as they did undler Honorius and the Comneni The Chresmologia (or manual) of imago painting which to this day guides the practice of the paintermonks of Mount Athos-still the official workshop of Greek religious painting-is the same as controlled the painters of the 9th and 10th centuries, from the time that the partisan of the use of images in the church triumphed over Leo the Isaurian. It is true that after the conquest of Italy by the Lombards a native school of art, indepenadent of the Byzantine, began feebly to develope itself. But it was so rude, so inferior in technical dexterity to its Eastern rival, that it had succumbed to it before the 11th century, and we have to seek in a few ivory carvings and some scattered missals for evidences even of its existenee. The *sdent will find such evidences among the ivories in the Mayer and Douce collections exhibited in this building. Thus fettered by the unyielding rules of Byzantine iconography, whieh extended not merely to the types of particular saints or saered personages, but to the whole anangement of every story that was permitted to be told in colour, it was only by slow and painful steps that art emerged into something like free and dramatic representation. All this end wall contains illustrations of this struggle from the stiff and meagre forms, the scanty draperies, rigid attitudes, and symmetrical arrangement of the Byzantine chresmology, towards the comparatively unfettered eomposition and correct drawing of the early Tusean school of Meacio. It was well done to hang among these early works some modern Rusia pictures, as showing the unyielding grasp of Byzantine art tradition. All namnes attached to small works of this first century of Italian art must be taken with hesitation. It is next to imposible here to refer to any picture as an undoubted example of Cimabue or Giotto, the two masters who usually stand at the head of the Italian emancipators of art from its Byzantine swaddlingclothes. This is inevitable. The larger and wellidentified pictures of the time are either immoveable mosaics, half-effaced frescoes, or altar pieces too highly valued to be obtainable by foreign collectors. The painting of small detached pictures at this period was rarely practized; art worked exclusively for the Church. The smaller works of the time, exhibited in galleries, are either portions of larger fixed altar-pieces removed from churches and being the miniatures which embelished the predeaa, or base of 'the laiger pictLure, or portable triptycles (pictures with a double folding shutter), intendea to be carried about by Lords or pre. Iates in warlike expeditions, or religious pil. grimages and peregrinations. But already in the pictures bearing the name of Duccio Da Siena (11), and IJgolino Da Siena (12), which are undoubted works of the Siennese school, the observer may see indications of vitalily and dramatic intention. Let him note, espeelally in the former, the feeling of maternal tenderness in the Virgin Mother, aud of infantina affeion in the chlld's pressure of his cheek to hers Such expressions are the foreshadowing of that employment observable in succeeding schools of the Virgin and her divine son as a type of motherly love, even rmore than a symbol of the mysterious relation of Christ to the human family. The work whAich has been ascribed to &fargharitone dArezzo (A.D. 1236-1313), representing the Virgin crowned by the Saviour, is unquestionably of later date, and might be referred with more probability to -some scholar of Giotto. The treatmen.t and character ara- precisely the ie; Ma mi.y be seen i& the lar* "QQtQation6 thoVi ," u it master, in the centre of the space between the two doorD which haa itself obviously been subjected to * severe procems of repainting. The only works here, which we can with confidence ascribe to Giotto are the two fragents 1.4 and-16, which formed part of the frescoes by that master in the church of the Carmtine at Florence, now destroyed by fire. They were actually sawn from the wall by Patch, the engraver, who published complete engravings of the series before the destruction of the churcL There is Giotto'sintensity of tenderness in the head of the woman who holds the child, and manifest traces of his grace and comparative freedom of action in the figure representing the daughter of Eterodias. Again, the picture ascribed to Simon Memmi (20) is an. inscribed and dated work of the master, apd there is nothing in the work itelf to disprove the inference from the inscription. So the small altarpiece with wings (23), bearing the name of Taddeo Gaddi and the date of 1338, is probably a genuine work of this the most distinguished of Giotto's.pupila; and the figuires with musical instruments (2X5), ascribed here to the same master, are not unworthy of him. They have grace and naturalness of action enough to show the great stride which the art had already made from its Byzantine. beginnings. These pictures, then, we repeat, must be regarded only as showing the general eharacteristics of Italian art before its first great advance into naturalness under Masaccio. But the visitor must not suppose that anything here shown can give him an adequate idea of the powers of Giotto, the master from whom the real commencement of Tuscan, as distinct from Byzantine art, should be dated. Giotto can only be judged in Florence, in Padua, and in Naples. The newlyuncovered frecoesjiu the church of Santa Maxis Novella, the painted walls of the Arena Chapel, and the series of the Sacraments in the Church of the Incoronats, must be seen before we can appreciate the singular invention, rare power of telling a storys and profound sentiment of beauty, which have crowned Giotto, the sovereign of Italian art, before Masaccio. None of his pupils carried painting beyond the point at which he left it. Andrea Orcagna had a power of conception, especially in the terrible, which places him apart; but in technical mastery, and in the general conception of artistic representation, he cannot claim a distinctive throne in the hierarchy of painting. But adequately to estimate him we must study his " Ast Judgment," and his " Triumph of Death," on the walls of the Holy FieId of Pisa, that impressive burial-place in which ancient and modern art have united to solenize death and enforce its lessons on the living. With Masaccio the visitor to the Manchester Exlhibition may trace the advance of art to a new reach of power. As has always been the case, this is due to a new infusion of naturalness,-an effort at more truthful representaWion of things as they appear. A hundred years separate Masaccio from Giotto, but the one left art still formal and half fettered, the other left it consummate in the power of representing the human face and form. The single work by which Masaccio is here represented-called his own portrait, and sufficiently resembling the acknowledged type of his faoeto justify the designatin-though the carnations have flown, is as solid and simple a rendering of a youthful head as Raphael or Titian could have painted-startling, indeed, in its reality and strong expresaion of individual character. Inadequate as it is to give the untravelled spectator a conception of Masccio's range and grasp of power, which must be seen in that Brancseci Chapel, in the church of the Carmine at Mlorence, which for so many years was the academy of the men we reverence as first in art-of Leonardo, and Michael Angelo, and Raphael-its qualities are marked enough to enable any one to apprecate the gap that separates the wchool of Giottofrom the Tuscan school of the 15th century, which begins with Masaccio. The appearance of every great master in the history of art is marked bysuch wide and sudden intervals. One such divides Giotto from his predecessoe r Masacclo marks a second. Raphael, Leonardo, and Michael Angelo unite to indicate a third. And when we turn to Germna art we shall find the same law exemplified in the cases of the Van Eycks, Mabuse, Quentin Matays, and Rubens. We have dwelt at some length on thesA the incunahula of painting, because it is here that just appreciation is most difficult for the untrained and the untravelled. Everyman has a difficulty in conceiving how art could ever have been so barbarous as it appears in the 14th century. It seems as if any attempt at representation ought to have been more like life than this. We have been anxious to point out that art did not begin with the attempt at representing things as they are-that it commenced in a rigidly defined religious symbolism, and that every deviation into naturalness from the narrow track marked out by the laws of Byzantine orthodoxy was a rebellion from which reverent spirits would naturally shrink, and by the consciousness of which they must often have been haunted and checked, even in the effort to which their perceptions and consciencoshadimnpelled them. That art was to be the handmaid of religion was of itself enough to deter artists from attempts at natural representation. The Saviour, the Virgin the saints, and mnrtyrs were glorified beings. The Church, which was the witness of their lives and the depository of their doctrines, might be supposedto be authorized to prescribe how they should be represented to the faithfuL Considerations of earthly beauty and symmetry had no place in such a matter. That art should be unlike nature ws no reproach while art owned only. a supernatural fnontion; and it is a testimony tothesoundecclesiastical sensewhicb governed the Byzantine churchinitsstern repression of private judgment in art, that, from the time naturalness of representation was introduced as an aim in art, thepainter, generationbygeneration, grew less and less an effective aid to the priestthat art gradualy divorced itself from the exclusive service of the altar; and that ita nominal dedication to relgion proved altogether insufficient to keep it, a it had been, a mere aiceasary to the church. NVe hope to trace the progrse of this change by help of this gallery in future articles. ANCTESTER, M&v 9. The prevalence of a raw easterly wind produced a hlisht diminution in tbe number of visitors to the Exhibition on Friday. On the other hand, the sale of season tickets was as great as ever, so that the receipts amounted to much the same as during the preIous days-viz., nearly 8001. The confidence in the financial sucecess of the undertaking therefore remains unabated. During Saturday the weather though enlivenedwith occaional gleamsof sunshine, was severe, even for an English May; yet, on the whole, the attendance was apparently rather better 1han on Friday. While the east wind blows the interior of.the building is cold to an extreme, and, what is worse, no means can be applied to warm it. The very perishable nature and enormous vlue of its contents (upwards of 6,000,0001.) have led to the moat stringent precautions being taken against the possibility of accident from fire No light or fire of any description, or under any pretence whatsoever, is allowed within the walls, and so rigidly is this law carried into effect that even the official letters on the business of the Exhibition are tealed at a detached office far removed. Thus when the weather is cold the building is cold in proportion, and cold it must remain till Eollus is more propitious. As a matter of course, thisinifaences the attendance, for the pictures and rare works of art can only be studied by visitors when standing still, and who therefore feel the low state of the thermometer a most unpleasant adjunct to tbh entertainment of the day. The sale of the provisional catalogue has been so rapid that a new one, on a greatly improved plan, will be issied in a few days. With re-gard to this we would beg to suggest that, among other improvements, it should contain, as well as the tames of the old masters, their place of birth andathe school to which each belonged. Two additional words would effect this, and the latter at loat would much facilitate general visitors in atudying practicaly the o.mparative merits Of the p lapte, Roma% and YeneX styles.

From- the statement made to us on the spot it appears that there ar two versions in connnion with the ciroum. stances which have led to this shocking calamity. Somefew weeks snce the premises of Mfr. Hlauter, furniture warehoueman and upholsterer, which' immediately adioln the e fes oss Maple and Co., were so much injured y'afirhe whs`1h broke out as to render the rebuilding of the whole, or a great portion neoesary. These works were entrea by Mr. Hunter to Mr. Johnson, builder, of Ph ix-place, Gray's-inn-road, and cUrried out under the direction of Mr. Redding, Mr. Humter's surveyor. WhiIe these works were progressing at mr. Hunter's, Mr. Maple thougt it a fitting opportunity to have some enlargements and ateratlons made in his premises adjoining, and Mr. MWapld's alteratiowswere entmaWito Mr.Taylor, hoilder, &C., of Seymour-street, Mr. Raggett, of Gower-street, being the surveyor to 3r. Maple. These works were in progress, audno apprehensions were entertained till Friday afternoon, when MI. H. Baker, the district surveyor, is stated to have come to view the premises, and he at once condemned the old party wall standing on the southern side of Messrs. Maple's premises. numbered 145, 146, and 147, Tottenham-courtroad, and directed that it should be at onco underpinned, and from the ground floor to the first floor new brickwork put in. The distioct orders stated to have been given by Mr. Baker, the district surveyor, to Mr. Johnson or his foreman, were, that the workmen were to take the partywall down from the ground floor to the first, and replce it with new brickwork, which was tobe supported by "under. pinning." It appears that Mr. Johnson's men came to work about 6 o'clock, and under orders from Mr. Moore, the foreman to Mr. Johnson, they commenced the removal of the brickwork of the party walL Mr. Taylor's men were also at work in the premises belonging to Mr. Maple, 147, Tottenhaua-court.road, the house immediately abutting on the party wall referred to. It is stated that Mr. Johnson's men commenced removing the brickwork from the party wall in two places at the same time-namely, near the front of the house at Tottenham.oourtroAd and also towards the back part of the premises. It is said that these hole in the brickwork were made to the extent of about six feet long by three feet higb, wben the party wall gave way dragging with it the two adjoining houses, Nos. 146 and 147, in Its desceut. This is one version of the cause which is stated to have led to the catastrophe. The other version is that derived from Mr. John Moore, the foreman to Mr. Johnson, the builder for Mr. Hunter. He states that he had tho superintendence of the 'works in coue of erection for the new premises belonging to Mr. Humter at 148, Tottenham. Oourt-road, which adjomn those of Mr. Maple's last house, numbered 147. The wall of 147 had, he says, been much cut about for the purpose of putting in a new bressemer, and all the ties bavingany connexion with the party wall had been cut off. The district surveyor, Mr. Henry Baker, came on Friday afternoon and inspected the works, and ordered the party wal between 147 and 148to be underpinmedandrepaired. In accordace vwith the direction of the district surveyor he gave instructions to the men that they should commence the underpinning of the party wall that morning. They came at the usual hour ian commenced the work, when the front wall of Mr. Maple's nearest house, No. 147, fell outward, causing the entire buUding to collapse, and that forced Mr. Hunter's party wall into the area of the space on which the house, No. 148 (Mr. Hunter's) was being rebuilt, dragging the next-door house, No. 146, with iL The first indication of anything wrong took plae about a quarter past 7 o'clock in the morning, at which time thee were between 20 and 30 young men and women, In the employ of Meam hple and Co., on the premisea, ithLer iu Dd or in the act of rising and dreising. Of this number aboat 20 were in the upper portions of the houses numberedl46andl47,whichhavefalen. At the same time tbere were Mr. Johnson's men at work at the wall on the one side, and some of Mr. Taylor's MlU. 3aple's builder) at work on the other. rwo of tbese men were canters, named Garnett and Richrd Turner, wbo were at workattheirbenchin thefirst floor of the house No. 147. At this moment a cracking noise was heard, and a. sound like thunder succeeded. The buildings fell with a frightful crash. Shortly after a strong body of polioe of the E division, under Sunerintendent O'Brien and Inspectors Checkley and Dugan, arrived, and labourers, under the orders of Mesrs Johnson and Tayllr, were set to work to ascertain who were the sufferers, and to rescue those who might be found alive as fast aspaible. The first who escaped were, singular to relate, Mr. Christmas, thebousekeeper andtwoyoungwomen employedinthe drapery department. Theywerein the sitting room on the second floor of 146 when the house fell and were very sightly hurt. The escape of Miss Christmu was trly miracuilous. She was at the moment of the fall dusting the piano, with 'which she asu ciaried away, and, falling in the hollow between the piano and a beam,'she ecped with a slight graze of the legs. As soon as the alarm created by such a catasrophe had in some degree subeided the muster-roll of the persona known to belin the houses at the time of the fall, and em- ployed on the works was called over, and ilso those attahed to Mesrs Mapli?s establishmient.

TO TZE DIZTOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In the debates touching the attacks mades upon General Ashburnham Lord Paumure and alL who spoko maintained that for a subordinate to" publish calumnies against his superior was a dangerous offence, demanding punishment; that a=x; officer so doing was unfit to be emp1oyed. This is talk. MIark the practice ! When Sir C. Napier was at the head of an army in the field, and in most difficult eircumstances, Sir' Jamea Outram, then Colonel or Major Outram, published a letter filled with shameful and amneless calumnies and insinuations against Sir Charle.- INapier. He told the soldiers that their General,. with an ignorance below that of a subaltern had moved them through pestilent marshes, and wil-'. fully as well as ignorantly caused the frightful mortality which had befallen them; in fact, that he was their murdere. And, that no miistake might occur as to his meaning, Buist, of the Bombay T'imes, repeating the accusation, acull. denounced Sir Charles as the "MJ/urderer of i1w Soddiers. ' Sir C. Napier, as shown in his biography recently pubished by me, demanded protection ani redress from the higher civil and military authorities; he got no redress. Effow was he aet ? HEr. was told by Lord Ripon that such attacks werewholesome stimulants to eald! And the.practicaI comment was the appointing of Outram to a most lucrative poet-one far above what his rank gave. him any title to hold I It woud seem that to assail one of Lord Paninure's appointments gives a totally different aspect. to such matters. W. NAPIER, Ueutenmnt.'3eneral. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES. Sir, -Not many months ago "A Staff Officee' published a work in which he freely preferred -all manner of charges of the most damaging and disgracefl nature against his brother officers. He actually accused LJieutenantGeneral the Earl of Cardigan, E.O.B., the Inspector-General of the British Cavaly, of ignorance of his profession and of cowardice in the field. Lord Cardigan forthwith appealed to his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief for protection. agast theme grave slauders, but the Commander' in-Chief very properly replied that, as they ha& beerL made anonymously, he couldnotinterfere. Lord Cardigan, having in the meantime ascertained that " A Staff Officer" was Major the Ron. Somerset Calthorpe, C.B., then appealed for protection to the Miniater of War. But Lord Panmure told him that as Major Calthorpe was on halfpay he was beyond the roach of the Horse Guard. And so the matter rested, Msjor Calthorpe immaediately publishing asecond editionof hislibels,in.a slightly mitigated form. Last week an officer aailed the character of thI Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces irL China in your columns; he did not, indeed, sign his name to his letter, but he described himself ini such, detail as to render it impossble that auy person. acquainted with the circumstances of the action to wl'ch he alluded could mistake him. Nevertheless, when called upon by Lord Clanricarde to protect the character of the man whom he had just despatched on a distant verice. Lord Panmure coolly explained that he did not know who General Ashburnhar'a assailant was, and clearlypreferred not to inquire, and so that matteralso rests, as far as the Minister of War is concerned. We have at the present moment another General officer, Sir James Outram, commanding troops before our enemies. Within the last two months a work has been published by Lieutenant-Generaj Sir William Napier, K.O.B., which Sir James Outramn is held up to publie mcorn as a traitor and a, liar, and is amcused over and over again of the most utter professional ignorance and incapacity. I beg that all those military men who are in the, habit of reviling the preu for their observations osi men and matters of war will bear in mind that im each of tbese three flagrant cases which I hav specified the " calumniators" lave been persos of thelr own profession, and that the Minite of War, having it in his powrerto brig them xtotrial, baw stedfly declined to do so. ad a plate robbery been com itted in his Loriis area,, ad ul bad the same clue to the thief that he asto Geaeral Ashburnham's asailant, I sipect we should not hear that LIord Panmure kad deelined to mrake furtherinqurybecause he 2id not know bow to discover the culprit's nass.

!O.REIGN INTELLI6ENCE. --- - - -FRANCE. (FBO! OUR OW OORPOMNDENT.) A portion of tho following appelra In our cecond dli- VI" ef SnTrdBv:r-I - PFRIS, FIDAY, MAY 8, 6 P.M. The rather sudden departure of Prince Napoleon for Berlin has given rise to a variety of conjectures as to the real cause of his disappearance. The Patrie, which had so stoutly contradicted the report of a journey to the Prussian capital, of course admits its error, but says that the Prince is intrusted with "a mission." Something has been said about his Imperial Highness being sent to gain over the King to settle the Neuch1tel quarrel, but is it likely that one who is so decidedly m favour of the Swiss would be cbarged with such a misaion ? Another supposition is, that the dislike of the Prince to Russia, and to everything that has even the appearance of encouraging any extraordinary intimacy with Russia, has something to do with this journey. The Grand Duke is not ignorant of the existence of that feeling, and was not overpleased at reading an article in favour of the £nglish alliance published in the Presse the very day lie ade his entry into Paris. Then (for Prince Napoleonl is no dissembler) the cold and distant manner between ths Grand Duke and the Prince is apparent to every one. So long as the two Princse were In Paris these things might be passed over; but the Grand Duke is going to Fontamnebleau and the absence of a member of the Imperial family from that place would be much more marked. The journey to Berlin, then, is by some believed to be merely tosave appearances. His absence, wrhich, under any circumstances, was certain, may now be expl dby e necessity of returning the visit of the ~~,launed y thet,audth nnsof Prussia. Few will believe it, and the Grand Duke lesat of all. In the meantime the Grand Duke has given a large order to A manufacturer in the Palais Royal for Russian crosses and stars, to be distributed in Prance and te other countries he intends to visit. A telegraphic wire, corresponding with the electric teiegraph from Paris to St. Petersburg, has been placed in the Palace of the Tuileries, and the apparatus is arranged in the very apartment of the Grand Duke Constantine, who is thus enabled at any moment to communicate with his brother, the Emperor Alexander. The Emperor has, it is said, again written to the King of Prussia on the subject of Kteuchatel, pressing him, in as urgent a manner as he can, to accept the solution proposed by the representatives of the four Powers, and already accepted by the Swiss Government. The tone of the letter is, I suppow, very courteous, hard words being only dealt out to ordinary people like those composing the Federal Council, and who are neither kings nor princes. We must be more civil to a Sovereign wrho may one of these days also come to pay his homage at the Tuileries. The King, however, is asked tosettle the question; and, however mild the Emperor may be in words, you may depend apon it that his irritation iF in secret strong against his " good friend and brother." This is very natural. The Emperor's amourpropre ishurt atfndinghimself rather mystified by King Frederick l On the other hand, the Swis are far from satsdfied with their friends; but I believe it would afford them great pleasure if the King definitively rejected the arrangement, and that matters resnained in stats quo. The Swiss would be the gainers, for it is more than doubtful whether the King of Prussia is disposed to repeat his military preparations of last year. Up to yesterday, I believe, Mi de Hatzfeldt had received no further communications from Berlin. The Swiss still declare they cannot advance a step more in the way of concession; whatever is to be done in that way must come from Prussia. It is said that a telegraphic despatch was addressed yesterday to the authorities at Toulon, Brest, and Rochefort, to suspend the embarcation of troops for China. This measure is explained, it is said, by the nature of the despatchea recently recelved from the French Minister at Macso, and which give hopes of a speedy and pacific conclusion of the existing differences with the Chinese Government. This information does not come directly from an official source, but it is very probably true, as a paragraph in the Ministerial journal Le Pays says, that a the sending to ahina of a battalion of marines on board the transport Yonne has been adjourned." Colonel Neale, so long British Consul at Varna, and whose services were so valuable during the critical period of the war, very recently paid a short visit to Paris, having obtained leave of absence from his post for some months. Durinog his stay here he renewed his acquaintance with the"French officers with whom he had been brought into close relationship at Varna, and who have evinced the most cordial and friendly feelings towards him, and a lively recollection of his services. The opinion of his zeal and acvity is, I believe, unanimous among our own troops; and it is pleasing to find the merits of our Consul readily recognized and kindly remembered by our allies.

The trial of 14 persons accused of having formed part of a secret society was concluded last evening before the Court of Police Correctionelle. The indictment charged that on the 24th of February last an insurrectionary movement was to have taken place at the Place de la Bastille. In order to produce a conflict, one of the conspirators was to have thrown a crown of flowers at the foot of the column of July, and was then to have stabbed the police agent who should attempt to arrest him. This first act accomplished, some of the conspirators were to rush on the neighbouring military guardhouses and seize the muskets while another band was to perambulate the boulevards and enter the wineshops, where they were to find other leaders to give the signal for the insurrection and direct the movement. On that same 24th of Fetruary, previous to any ostensible manifestation, seven persons were arrested at the Place de la Bastille, the greater number of them armed with poignars or firearms and cartridges. Among those arrested was Deley, who declared that the place of meeting of the conspirators was at the house of Bailly, who 'kept a wineshop on the Quai de la Tournelle, and that the plan of a revolution was discussed at their meetings. Pilette, the barrister, was found guilty, and sentenced to imaprisonment for 15 months and a fine of 1,000 francs, Vivien and Bailly to imP'risonment for 10 months and a fine of 500 francs, ClementandRegnier to imprisonmnentior 10rmonths and a fine of 100 fancs, Martinon to imprisonment for one year and a fine of 500 francs, Deley, Gauthier, Valla, and Colin to imprisonment for sIX months and a fine of 100 francs, Blondell,_ for being in possession of prohibited arms, imnprison-. ment for three months and a fine of 50 francs. A letter from Rome of the 4th inst. informs us that the Pope set out that morning for Loretto. His Holiness quitted his apartments at 7 to celebrate divine service at the grand altar in St. Peter's. He afterwards assisted at another mazs, after which special prayers for travellers were recited. After having rested a short time in the vestry, his Holiness Solemnly traversedthe entire church, accompanied by the Palatine Cardinals, the Dinisters, and a great number of prelates and officers of the Court. He received the most profound' homage from all sides. He got into his carriage at the foot of the grand staircae. The door of the carriage was opened and closed by the venerable Cardinal Macchi, who, notwithatanding his 87 years and his infirmitieswould not neglect his duties. General de Goyon was on horseback at the head of the French and Roman troops composig the garrison of Rome, who formed a line to the gates of the city. The General rode beside the Pope's carriage until he quitted the city. A numerous crowd arrived from all quarters. Th !filled the churcb, the square, and the road taken by the co*ge. His Holiness proposed to dine the same day at Nepi, and to sleep at Civita-Castellana. A letter from Naples of the let inst. states that the garrison of that city had been completely changed, and was now exclusively composed of Swiss regiments. The Neapolitan regiments of artillery and cavalry are now quartered in towns where they never before had been stationed.

The Nord, of Brussels, publishes the following telegraphic despatche- " PARIS, MAY 7, 4 pm. "In consequence of a gracious invitation from Her Majesty Queen Victoria given to his Imperial Highness by Lord Cowley, when he had the honour of being presented to him, the Grand Duke Constantine, after visiting Cherbourg, will embark at Ostend for Osborne, on a visit to Her Majesty the Queen of England." THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA IN HUNGARY. (FROMx ou OWN coEsrSornNDEr.) VIENNA, MAY 6. In the course of the evening of the 4th instant persons of my acquaintance, who had witnessed the pompous spectacle described in my letter of yesterday from the windows of houses in Peath, Informed me that the reception given to their Majesties by the non-official part of the population was "'kind (wohlwollend), but not enthusiastic," and the same statement was subsequently made by travellers who returned with me by railroad to Vienna. " The cheering," said a person who is well acquainted with the peculiarities of the Hungarian character, " appeared feeble and forced to those who know what Huungarian throats are capable of when their owners are m a state of enthusiastic excitement." Thereply of the Emperor to the congratulatory speech of M. von Conrad, the Burgomaster of Peath, was:-" I ara perfectly convinced of your loyalty, and am pleased to hear the expression of it from your lips." After a short pause His Majesty continued: "The Empress, who has long wished to see this beautiful city, is certainly as pleased with it as I am." His Majesty told the nobles who waited on him in the Palace at Buda that he had come " to examine into the wishes and necsities of the Hungarian nation." In front of the picturesque ruins which crown the summit of the Vissegrad was the A.igyar inscription, " Isten foott" (" God has brought you"), in letters of enormous size. On the 2d inst. 70 hungarian nobles waited on the Archduke Governor-General, but there were not so many present when their Majesties made their entry into the Palace on the following day. Shortly before the arrival of their Majesties an elderly Magyar entered the court of the Palace, where he attracted universal attention, although less sumptuously clad than some of his fellows. The noble, who wore a suit of black velvet with buttons of jet, would [have been invaluable as a model for am artist. The ngure or the man was perfect, and the face would have been equally so had it not been deeplv pitted by the smallpox. The hair, 'which was rather lonot behind, was as dark and almost as lustrous as pitcoal; the eyes were large, black, fiery, and piercing; the nose was slightly aquiline, the mouth small and finely cut, the chin well formed, and the complexion as dark as that of anAmericanIndian. If onthetop of the head above-described is placed a black velvet " kalpag' (the Hungarian cap), with a straight black feather, you have a faithful iortrait of the " full. blood" Magyar, who the evenng before last inquired of the admiringlackeys his waytotheStateapartmentB of the palace. At the establishment of x.

On the modem ket, which is in perfect keeping with the jewel which it contains, is the following inscription:-"St. S. Gisella, PrimaRungarime gina; Anne MS." ["St Gisella (Elizabeth), first Queen of Hunga; in the year 1010."1 That thebrooch aotusJIybelonged to Queen GiselIr is a well-authentcated fact. The Lombardo-Venetiam hate the Austrdans with such a deadly hatred that no concesions will ever make loyal subjects of them; but such is not the case with the open.hearted, chivalrous Hungarians. What they rineipally complain of is the excessie and in- eonierzte zeal of the emcn, "ho appewr to sacrifice everything to & with to giOver 16= ion to their superiors, and, is a consequenoe, to obtain pTomotion." The provalent opinion in Hungary is that the Austrian Government will eventually ba obliged to make concesions. The Russian are doing all in their power to mako mischieE in EHungary, but the Magyars, who have a great dislike to all the Slavonic races, have hitherto refused to listentothe voice of the tempter. In my opinion. the Emperor cannot restore the ancient order of things, hut the Hlungarians firmly believe that he will ultimately find it necessary to do so. Travelling in Austria, which was formxerly a pain, is now a pleasure. Dur.ing my journey to Peethi and back again my passport was not onee asked for. The following telegraphic despatch has been received from Pesth . "g BUDA, MAY 5. "T.his morning their Majesties permitted deputationi from numerous country districts to pass before them. At a later hour the Court dignitsries, military men, clerg-, country gentry, and civil autborities waited on the ERupe. ror. At 2 o'clock tho Empress held a lev6s, at which only ladies were present. At 5 o'clock there was a ve,y l.rge party at dinner. In the evening both the town were illU minated" RUSSIA (R0OM O(M 3nERLn oOnMrPONDZiT.) BERLIN, MaY 7. The Emperor's birthday (April 29) was celebrated in St. Petersburg yesterday week with as much solentity and a good deal more heartiness than Imperial birthdays havebeenwont to be celebratedwith in that capital hitherto; besides an illumination in the evening, there was a parade of the garrison in the morning, and divine service, at which the Archbishop, with peculiar warmth and in reference to ;the approaching happy event in the Emperor's flamily, implored the Divine blessming on the Imperial House and on God's elect. All business, both publio and private was suspended for the day, and every done devoted himself unreervedly to the relaxation of the holyday, which we may assume to have been kept by the population with some amount of sincere love for himn whoe birthday they were celebrating, inasmuch as they haveby common consent given him the nme of "the good," or "the kind." In the regulation that has been made, admitting the shames of the railway network scheme to be received at par (that is to say, for the fulllarmount that may have been paid up on the share) in aUl cases there contractors and others maay have to, deposit securities in the Government bank, one great deficiency has been remarked-viz., it is not distinctly stated whether this privilege is accorded to all the shares of the concern, whether sold abroad or not, or whether it is confined solely to the. 150,000 shares which the Russians are to be permitted to acquire This doubt, until it be cleared up, wil of coe deter all foreign contractors, 'who might otherwise be disposed to dabble in that paper; in Russia itself, oi the other band, where there can be no doubt upon the subject, the shares will be bought not only by ali persons about to deposit securities with the Government, bhlt also tho3s who have already got ready money locked up in suoh deposits willpurchase these shares, and thensettheic ready money free by substituting the shares for it; they will thus secure themselves the 5 per cent, on the shares, vhile on their deposits they only get 4 per cent. As regards the rate of intere3t the Government has guaranteed to the shareholders, men in the Administration seem themselves to perceive that 5 peC cent., though talked of as a minimum, is a dividead that the lines tbemsetves are by no means likely to produce; and accordingly the question i5 being mooted in St. Petersburg as to what ways aud means are to be looked to for the deficiency between the actual net produce and the rate of dividend secured. The result of the deliberations seems to be that the amount hitherto appropriated to the construction and repairs of the public roads and communications shall still be set aside nominally for the same purpose, but actually towards meeting the deficit that is foreseen. Tee sums that have been devotedto thispurpose hitherto have been very considerable, but, either from the inherent difficulties of the task, or from the inefflciency of Count Kleinmnihel, who was formerly at the head of this department, the roads in Russia leave every legitimate jostulate as regards means of cossmunication unsatisfied. For this reason the pre- sent Emperor translerred the post to General, Tsehevlin, from whom great things were expected; - but even under him the results are till very unaatisfactory,and people do not failto remark that, whiIe his indulgence, or perhaps his inexperience, hasopened the door to new abuses, he has not as yet' succeeded in remedying the old ones. The Mnister, of Finance, M. Brook, seems also not to stand particularly high in official esteem; and though his own ostimate of hinself, as pronounced on several occasions by him, partiularly at the time of his taking office, is by no means excessive, that of his friends seems hardly to equal it. The chief reason why he continues to retain his ortefeutlle seems to consist in the difflculty of finding a successor to him. The subscription for the 150,000 shares of the railway network scheme was opened in St. Petersburg on the 28th ult. In one letter which Ihave received the bare fact is mentioned without any commentar:y as regaras the result. In another the rush to secure a place for the subscribers' names in the list of the fortunate shareholders is described as having been very great, and as offering an irrefragable proof of the feelingsprevalent among the public on this subject, and the great desire the latter has to promote the construction of railways and other means of communication. The number of shares left open for allotment will hardly suffice to satisfy the great demand. The Northan Bee is so charmed by the speculative ardour which some unusually sharpsighted reporters have aacertained to exist in the public that it proposes to profit by it to get up a line along the banks of the Anoor, and another from Nishni Novgorod to the coast of the Pacific. That spirited journa asks: ' Russia once had a route of her own to Asia, why should itnotnow bereviveabyarailroad to the Pacific2 The objeot Of such a means of communication would be the civilization and the introduction of Cina into the community of commercial nations; and thli object would be thus better a,itained than by American, French, and English fleets. Japan, too, would by this means be brought into cleser contact with Earope." The only novelty about this notion is the substitution of a railway for a canal, for Peter I. had already conceived and elaborated a plan by which the Pacific was to be brought into communication in the North by the Amoor and a canal opening into the Bay of Finland, and in the South betweea the Pacific and the Black Sea. The number of apssora to foreign pirts applied for and issuer in Kussa has enormously inreaped since the recent facilities have been introduced ; not only have the expenses connected with the document itself been redduced, but it is now competent to the Governor of every province to issue them instead of frt remitting the application to St. Petersburg for approval and comphiance,-a process which, when carried on between one of the extremi.- ties of the empire and the capital, eometimes costs a year. The number of passports issued used formierly to amount by the end of April to about 700; but in this year it has already reached 7,450. The recent alterations that were made In the quarantine laws in consequence of the cessation of the Sound Dues seem now to have received a fartherohange, aecording to which ali ships coming from healthy ports are to be permitted to enter Russian ports without formality; all 'vessels, on the contrar, that have cleared out of infected portq, or have Egyptian cotton on board, are required to have a bill--o health signed by a Russian Consul. Thea latestnes that the Korthern lice brings from Siberia mentions that two American Consuls had just arrived at Irkutsk, who had reached that place by proceeding up the Amoor. The complaints were very great there that all gold and silver coin had vanished from Siberia; of the slver it was known that Chins was the quarter to which it had deare,asit apred, in payment for tea, tbe Uinteae 3iowr twang a .lees quantity than for-. merly of Russian manufactures From Kiach'a it .was stated that, while very small quantf-| ties of goods were being received, there, huge qusanities of silver vwere arr.iving there by every| conveyance, SPAI. tPou onw OcVB ZPoNDmeL) MADRID, lAyr i.

As usual the stret we lined with troops, and m3ass wras performed at a temponsy altar erected ant the F toen e column which cwmo. menorates the self*devotion of Daoiz and Yeladc . But, notwithstnding the complete holyclay and the fino weathcr, the number of persons out of doors was great and visibly less than in former yeas, especialy as regards vwomen. This is mainly to be attributed to the alarmist rumours lately spread abroad, and to the reports of projected insurrections ad assssnation circulated by C-overument organ Everything passed off very quietly. There was no meeting of the Chambers either on that day or yesterday. To day both Chambers met, but nothing of interest is likely to occur in either of them until four or five days have elapsed, and untlithe appointment of sertaries, committees, &c., shall have been completed, and the committee has reported on the addrews to the Qaeen. The Queen continnes to remain indoors. Her husband waa last night at the principal theatre here, the ItalianOpera Instead of ricing, as is customary, on his entranoe, the audience remained seated, and took not the idightest notice of him. I am assurod that the same, was the cawe ond a previous night. This excites little surprise, the King being completely discredited howre; but, nevertheless, it causes some conversation, and I have to-day heard several persons remark on thealteredfeelings of the Spanish publictowards the Royal family, and on the rapid and deep decline of that loyalty for which Spaniards were formerly noted. Tne reports and tales circulated here are a furtherproof of this, and also of a feeling of bitterness, bordering on hatred. Stories are toId of the most violent quarrels in the palace, of very strong languag used, and even of blowns strucl The latter and the greater portion of this scandal ae, I fully believe, destitute of foundation. That there are dissensions between the Royal pair admits of no doubt, but it is not credible that they have reached such lengths as these. Nevertheless, these tale exagera tions, and even fabrtions, though they doubtless are-are repeated on all aides, with an accompaniment of maheions comment andascornful laughter. It is truly a deplorable state of things, and one cannot but grieve that the conduct of the high personage thus assued and caiumniated should in some measure have given colour and pretext to hostile inventionx. A newspaper announces that a convent of nuns is on the point of establishment at Aranjuez, aud its superor is to be the notorious Sor Patrocinijo. Smuggling in the north and east of Spain is car ried on to a greater extent than ever, and the smugglers, when attacked, fight for their property. The Parlamento gives details of a desperate afray in the neighbourhood of Saragosa on the 26th of April, between 40 contrabandists and 20 infantry soldiers. The latter were supported by 20 cavalrymen, -who had carried them to the scene of action en croupe, but the nature of the ground did not allow the horse to act. A lieutenant and a soldier were badly wounded, and an ensin was killed. The smugglers made off, hav tour of their number Idllec or wounded They were escorting 48 or 60 loads of contraband goods, the retreat of which they appear to have successfully covered. The Three per Cents, were done at 40.10; ditto, Deferred, 26.90.

AUSTR4LrA. (FROM OUR OWN' CORUFSPO.N@M- . MELBOURNx5 MinCjr 14. Tabodar, the sa inst., the Haines 3inistry was dfeae on a vote of no confidence by a majority of 29 to 23, and immedlat'ly afterwards Sr. Heinse announoed that he should immediately plae his rauation and tbut of blg coUesgues in his Excellency' hands. It felloutthus:._ The Government had asked for and obtaineda,oteof 2T?0-00L for immigration. To administer this fond they had obtained the Sanction of the Houw for the appointment of a cdief commisioner ana five or six sabordinate agent,. with other expense, the amount of which I beliere hu not yet been aseeraned. According to one memer.- l supporter of the Government, the "ataff" wol cost 5 per cent. on the sum voted, or about 14,00#M; according to another member it would amount to about double that sum. A few evenings after the immigrtion resolutions had been psAed, in the coue of somefinncisl statemenits, tho treaser, Mr Sladen, lot out that of the 270,0001. voted, it wag only in. tend to expend 190,0001. in 1857. It Wa at onoseen that the costly mehinery of the Comnisdoner and his sa bdbeenobtaed under something very like deceson; "'false prstencese some ealled it; and thAt tbe percentg cost of the mchuiery, be it what it migt, wsu more than doubled by the reduction of the expenditure, from 270,0001. to 120,000. AseeordingIy, when on juesday, the sa of March, the estimates were called on, and the Treasurer moved that "the Speker do now leave the chair," the motion was mat by the following amendment, moved by 3r. Shanay:- "ThaS this o, beforeM oedeln to the tuither oeesl,Won otthe esUnates, feels bound lbee xp sedan dion, eheus onOf th eo epnsd by Her MJeqs Goverment in obtaining a vowe for imiration duflutdie Yew 1857 which exceaby nese a sats ot10O,CODO tbe autbyDropdsobe exd ed on ,u, sctht o a DsOceding calcolatod tO came oDufalo n in tbe Dubli accounts and Tender ftlUe the aborios efifA of the Commlttee et Supply to Inkode eoemy in $he publo expsnditme." The debate which esued waM a very animated one, bnt Would not be interesting to your reders. The amendment was treated b both sides of the HIouso as a votbof "' no oonfidence," on, in fact, as well an in termg, itwas, Ministers complained that such a rote should not have been brought forward without notice, ilor when there were three vacancies on their side of the Houe caused by ihe late inlater,,W changes. But there were two vancies on the opposite side also, so tbiat the majority would not hare been redooed by more than one, or at the most two; and it is worthy of --ark that there was only one member of the House absent, and, as he has leave of absenoe, I believe he coold vot have voted until his leave had oxpired, even had ho been present. On the following day 3Mr. O'Shanasvy was sent for, and by Friday night had succeeded in forming a Ministry. The following are the names:- Chief Secretary-J. O'Shansy, vice Haine Tzeamrer-J. L. Foster, vice Sladen. Trade and Customs-E. Greevs, vice Chfldem Crown iands-Gavan Daffy, vice Clarke. Pablio Work-George Hlorne, vice Paedy. Law Officers of the Crown-E. S. Chapman, Attorney. General, vice Feullows; and Dennistoun Wood, SolicitorGeneral, vice Sitwell. There are some peculiarities about tis Ministry which desewve notice. There vre two gentlemen in it -who have been Colonial Secretaries-Mr. Poster, who Was Colonial Secrtary at the time of the Ballarat riotg, and M[r. Chapman, who filled that ofrice in Van Die. nen's Laud, but who loat It on declining to support transportation. The other members are new to official life, ex,,pt that some of them have Legislative experience. Two are Roman Cathoics-O'Shannassy and Gavan Dtffy,-and there is no doubt that a "No-Popery" cry would lose them some supporL On the other hand, the old Ministry had lost public confidence chiefly by their reckless management of tho finanoes, and the number of little shabby financial tricks they had been detected in; so thast if the 0'Shanauuy Miuistry in it present state should not last tothe sssion of 1857.8, it will have done some service by breaking up the old clique, and destroyig a certain P-Uge in its favour, Chapman not being in the House, andWood never having been in the old Council, were berore constituencies when they took office, so that they will not, if elected, have to go again before their constituents; the others will have to vacate tkeir mats. Greeves, Doffy, and Horne arn, it is si, secure. O'Shanasy Wil, it is said, be opposed on the " No Popery" cry by John Pa6ooeoFawkner, wrho is an E. dependent, and honestly blieves that the Pope is anti. Christ; but it is said that O'Shanay is too strong for him At lilmore, the place for which he elected to st on a doable return. Foster, Who is member for Williamatown, is not quite so sfte; he ws returned without opposition, and had no meas of trying his strength, and it is sa there is a strong partY opposed to him. Chapman will be hard prsed at St. Kilda by the OX-AttornevyGeneral Fellows, and if he and Foster fail to secure seats it Will probably bring the O'Shanay Ministry to an untimely end. The Brighton election takes place on Monday, that for St. Eilda on Tuesday. There is also a new Mimistry in Tasmania. The former Ministry, consisting of Mr. Champ, Colonial Secretary; Mr. Francis Smith, Attorney-General; and Mir. Rogers, SolicitorGeneral, had strengthened themselves by the addition of MIr. T. D. Chapman, a merchant, as Treasurer; and Mr. H. Anstey, a brother of Mr. Chisholm Austey, as Commissioner of Crown Lands. There can be no doubt that this Ministry Ws distinguished for abiltity ana integrity, but they assumed responsibility under the new system at a vory trying time. The finances of tho colony under the old system had got into a deplorable condition; this was Aggravated by a large expenditure for immigration, which Ws of little permanent service to the colony, owing to the uperior attractiyeness of this colony to the labouring classes. There was a deficit of some 80,0001, which the new Trea r proposed to meet in part by increased taxation. Mr. T. D. Chapman hal been tho originator and principal promoter of the simple taiff of eight or nine datyable articles of large consumption-spIits, wines, beer, sugar, tea, coffee, tobacco,abolishing ad vcorem duties aud duties on numerous artides of small financial productiveness. The Treasurerps financial expedient was to increase the already high duties on tho existing articles, and to increase the number of dutyable articles. Among other things he proposed to tax imported cattle and sheep for food, and to introduce stamp duties. This was opposed by the whole colony, and at length the M*istry were compelled to yield to the pressure from withouL An aaverse motion wsmade in the Aembly to reduce the salaies of the Governor and of the Ministers, though the latter are certainly not Very extravagant. The Ministers generously consented to reduce their own salaries, but opposed the reduction of the Governor's-andI thinkveryproperly-onthe ground that it was a sort of Parliamentary contract which could not be departed from with good faith. They were, however, out. voted on the question, and they resigned,-the only honourable oourse open to them. Mr. Gregson, who moved tho reduction, was sent for, and he has succeeded in forming a Ministry, but it is thought that he will not be ablo to carry on the governmont for any length of time. His colleagues are Mr. Join Gregion (his son). Attorney-General; Mr. Charles Meredith and Mr. Miller fill two of the vacant offices,-tho latter is the editor of a newspaper; nd the Solicitor-Generalship is, I believe v-acnt,-atleast, thegentlemanwhoBenameappeared in the papers, br. Rogers, is now in Melbourne. In New South Wales it is rumoured that the Parker Miniryis byno meas scu From the number of colonies in this part of the world, in North Amerioa, and in the Wet Indies which have no , Parliamentart Ministrie, and their short tenure of office until the new system gets into working order, a Ministerial crisis will probably grace your columns about onoe a month; yet I cannot doubt that the now system wi work iell and beneficially for the public welfare in these colonies; indeed, the pressure oonstantly kept on the. Ministry here by the Opposition has already produced a oonsiderable effect upon the estimates, and it is to be hoped tho finanacalcondition of the couty Wl be such as to meet a period of difficulty without serious,embarrssment.

LAW REPORT. COUIRT OF QUEEN'S BEXCE1, WEs Lr_ MTv a CHAPMdAN V. VAN TOLL. Vtzn,gs at l.isi -Priua, 6efore Lord CA BELL and Commom Juriea.) jar. tiawkins and Mr. C. Pollock appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Doyle for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, William Chapman, 'was an nttorney at Richmond, and he suedthe defendant, a widow lady named Van Toll, to recover the sum of 481. 2s. lOd. for woria maa la'our done an an attorney. The defendant pleaded only the general issue. It appeared that the sum of 1,0001. had been lent to a Captain Roberts on the security of his bond, and the defendant, wishing to recover the amount stil due, placed the matter in the plaintiff's hands. He instructed his London agent, lir. George Hilder, to take the necessary proceedings, under the advice of a special pleader. A writ was issued in July, 1855, and two days after its service-yizn, on the 16th, Captain Roberts wrote a letter to the defendant, in which he said he had repaid the sum of 4501., and that only 5501. was due; that he was ready to hand over that amount, through his solicitors, on receiving a proper receipt; and that he was prepared to show that that was the amount the dofendant had received. This letter was forwarded to the pleintiff, and by him to his agent h but, instead of availing hself of the provision in the 3d section of the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 which gave him power to apply to a judge and get the account referred, he delivered a declaration, and proceeded to prepare for trial in the regular course. The cause was set down for trial at Guildhall on tho 14th of December- but after the briefs had bNei delivered to counsel it was arranged that the record should be withdrawn, and that it should be referred to the Master to state the amount. This was accordingly done, and the Mfaster certified that 7411. was due; but when exeoution was ismued nothing could be obtained. Roberts for a time left the country, and on his return he became a bankrupt, but had paid nothing. The defence was that when Captain Roberts wrote the letter of the 16th of July, admitting his liability, it was the duty of the plaintift to get the matter referred under the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, and that his not having done so was negligence which disentitled him from recovering. The plaintiff and his agent were recalled, and asked to explain why they did not apply to a judge under tho Act. They stated that they saw Captain Roberts's solicitors, and that they got time to plead, and pleaded sevoral pleas, denyiag liability. Lord CAMPBELL, ia summing up the evidence, said the question for the jury was whether the plaintiffhad blen guilty of negligence, such as rendered his services wholy useless to the defendant in not adopting a most salutary onactment of the Legislature, which enabled either party, without deliverng a deolaration and going on to trial, to nalke an application to a judge to have the case snmmail decided, or to have it referred. His Lordship read the 3d section of the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, which tnacted that, "If it be made appear, at any tune after the issuing of the writ, to the satisfaction of the Court or a Judge, upon the application of either party, that the matter in dispute consists wholly or In part of matters of mere account which cannot convementl be tried in the ordinary way, it shall be lawful for the Court or judge, upon such application, if they or he think fit to decido such matter in a summary manner, or to order tiiat such matter, either wvholly or in part, be referred to an arbitrator appointed by the parties, or to an officer of the court, or, in country causes, to the judge of any Count Court, upon such terms as to costs and otberwise as su.h Court or judge shall think reasonable." His Lordship said this was a most salutary enactment, and there could be no doubt that this case came within it. It was a question of mere account, and, though the mode of trial by jury was the best that had ever been invented by the wit of man for the tnal of some questions, a matter of account was not fit to be ted by a jury, and could be much better disposed of by a single judge. He (Lord Campbell) had no hesitation in saylag that this was acase in *hich a judge would have made an order of reference. It was an action on a bond, and the only question was how much was due upon it. If it had been referred to the Master, the whole matter would have been over by the end of the month. But, instead of that, a declaration was filed, and notice of trial was ven; and it was not till the trial was comiug on that it was discovered that it was not - a fit case for a jury, and it was referred. His Lordship thought there certainly was evidence of negligence, bul some explans,tion had been made of it, which deserved the attention of the jury. Irrespective of that, it did not appear that the plaintiff was at all to blame. His Lordship did not think the plaintiff was entitled to the oosts incurred after the writ was issued. The jury found a verdict for the defendant. Mr. POLLOCK submitted that the plaintiff was entitled to recover his costs down to the service of the writ. Lord CALPBELL.-NOt if his services were wholy useless. The jury said that was their opinion Lord CAMPBELL said he thought the verdict was a salutary decision, and it would showv that it was not only the duty, hut the interest, of attorneys to avail themselves of this salutary enactment, which enabled parties without delay or expense to have matters of account adojusted. Verdict for the defendant. BUSSINZSS OF THE COURT. Lord CAmPBELL said it would be convenient for him to state that lie would not be able to sit here on MIonday, as he would be engaged in the Court of Criminal Appel but Mr. Justice Wightman would sit here at 11 o'clock. THE QUEEN V. DUODALE. Mr. MIacaulay, Q.C., and Mr. Bodkiin appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Serjeant Parry and Mr. Langford for the defendant. This was an indictment which charged the defendant, Wiiam Dugdale, of Holywell-street, with the publication of obscene prints on three several occasions, and also with the publication of an obscene libel. When the case was called on the defendant rose in the back part of the court in a very excited state, and, after stating that he had been dragged from his house and lodged in prison for 14 weeks, he claimed to be allowed to read an extract from Lord Campbell's own book (2Vze Lives of tae Lord Chanceloers), in which Lord Thurlow had pronounced the illegality of the treatment to -which he had been sub. jected. Lord. CAMrPELL asked what application the defendant lacd to make. The defendant was then induced to come down on to the floor of the court, when he said he wanted to know what the charge against him was, and who the witnesses were baf ire he was put on his triaL The defendant continuoed declaiming in a very excited state, when Mr. Serdeant PAnuR rose and sid he hacd been instrtherd to defend the defendant, and he thought the defendant rad great reason to complain that the present charge ha tbeen a agiseat nshimbend hisback, and withouTgoing before a magitrate. Therewere nodepositions danathedelenant did not know who were to be witnesses against him. Probably the defendant wished to have his trial postponed. Lord CAMPBELL then asked the defendant whether he wished Mr. berjeait Parry to be his counsel. The defendant'said ho certaiy did, for he considered Serjeant Parry the most clever man at the bar; aun he then too his sear quitly till he was brought up for judgment. A man namedkenryDodson, who described himself as an ivory bone brushmaker, hut who had some time ceased to make brushes, said he wvas occasionally employed by the Society for the Suppression of Vice, and that hoe went on two several occasions to the defendant's shop, at No. 5, bolyuwell-street, on the 29th of December and on the 13th of January last, and purehased on each occasion a dozen prints, for which he paid lws. The defendantb served im. eto marked the first lot andc gave them to the seetary of the Eociety, and the socond lot he handed to a polceman 'wiseaccomapanied himn, but waited outside. Onjromtsexamination it appeared that he received at the rate of hs a-day when employed by the society, and at other timies he got his living by attendn at sales, &c. Joseph Barcher, a policenia or3 the j division, Baid he accompaniedl the lnst witness to the defendant's shop on the 13th of January, and received 12 pr ints from iri when he prme out.

Eaton sakid he was an artist - he accompanied Dodeon to the defendant`s shop on the ~9th of December, and bought a book there, and saw Dodson buy the prints of the defendant. This witness went again on the 16th of January, and gave the defendant a sovereign for a book gwhich he now produced, and which was the obscelne libel laid in the indictment. He also reoeived 5s. a-day when employed by the society. The book and prints were handed up to the jury, and, to judge fzom the expression of the jurymen's counteuances, they must have been of the most aibominable and loathsome description. Mr. Serjeant PARRY then addreswed the jury.for the defendant, and said that while he could not for a moment* pretend that the prints, &o., were not of the character descibe he houht te jry wuldnot he acting safely If heyrefed pontheevienc ofth two witnesses, Do.- sonandBurhe, wo hd eencaledto prove the charg.

WILIAM STRANGE. Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., and Mr. Bodkin appeared for the prosecution, Mr. R. T. Cole defended. This wras another indlictment similar to the last, and. charged the defendant, Wiliamn Strange, of No. 183, Fleetstreet with the publication of two obscene libels, the one called the Women of Lonzdon, and the other Paul Pry. It appeared that this defendant, who was a ver res ectable lookling young man, kept the shop in question, wbere he sold newspapers and periodical papers generally. The publications were sold by him openly on the 26th and 29th of Janunary, and were taken by the defendant from a pile of about 0 sniore of the same sort. It was also stated that they were sold at other shops in London. Lord CAmP3r.LL expressed his astonishment and horror at hcaring that obscene papers like those prodaced were sold publcly in the streets of London for one penny. It Further appeared that the Paul Prs~ij was printed for " Richard'Martin, 183, Fleet-street" (the defendant's shop', hut no one could tell who "Richard Martin" was. Mr. COLE said the defendant was utterly unconscious, when he sold the papers, that they contained anything obscene, and when he discovered that one number a! the Women of London contained something improper, that number was altogether suppressed. The learned counsel caUed several tradesmen who gave thedefendant a good character, and smon them a man named Vickere, who had a hook.shop in Ilolyweli.street5 hut who said there was nothing immoral sold in his shop. L;ord CA.HPBELL, in summing up the evidence, said he was filled with alarm and horror at finding publications of this0obsene and description systematicaly8Old ill the public streets of London.. His Lordship said he had not looked at the publications in the previous case, but in this instance he had felt it to be his duty to examine the rapers for himself, and he found that the obscenity waS by no means ooasinedto one number, but in a previous number, to which his Lordship referred, therewerearticlesof asimilardescription,some times intheformof leading articles, and again inlettersfrom correspondents. Thesepapersweresoldopenlv andpuhliclyin the streets. In former tines complaints had been made that such publications were aUowed to be circulated in the city of Paris; but here we find these papers published weakly, hUedwith obscenity, and sold for onepenny. Hitherto there had been some check to such publications, arising from the high price which was exacted for them, as in the previous case where one guinea was exacted for one book by the defendant Dugdale. But these publications were now sold for one penny,-a state of things which his Lordship, with great feeling, declared to be a disgrace to the country. However, the jury must not be swaqed in deciding this particular case by their feelig on the general question of this publication, but must say whether or not the cbarge was proved againstthe defendaht. If they thought he did not know that they were immoral they must say that he was not guJlty; but they must beat in mind the evidence that they had been sold by him week after week, and that the number of tho Paul Pry produced was taken from a pile of about 20 more. If they thought he must have known and was perfectly well aware of their nature, they ought to find him guilty, and it was no excuse for him to say that he also sold the Household Words and other publications of a most interesting, moral, instrudivo, and beautiful character for which the country was Jndebt-ed to Mr. Charles Dickens. The jury without hesitation found the defendant Guilty, and the foreman added that the jury considered that these cheap publications had a far greater tendency to demoralize the pulic than the others which were sold at a bigher Lord CAMPDns.n said he entirely and hearUtily concurred in the opinion of the jury. The defendant William Dngdale then stood forward to receive sentence, and being allowed to address the Court, he proceeded to harangue in a most excited and frantic manner' against his prosecutors, and particularly against a man named Stanton, who was sitting near him, and who, he said, some time since had broken into his house and stolen groperty in books worth 3,0001. He had brought two actions inthe Court of Exchequer, and in one of them, by the award of Mr. C. E. Pollock, Stanton had been compelled to pay him 841. He charged the prosecutors with a conspiracy to precure his conviction upon this charee, whichho declared to be false and unfounded, and he reaa an extract from Lord Campbell's Life of Lord Camden to show the llegality of general warrants, &c. He frequently turned towards the man Stanton in a most threatening manner, and when he had worked himself up to the hi t pitch of excitement,he -was seen to open a penknife which be held in his hand, with the evident intention of doing mischief to himself or somebody, but he was immediately seized by several persons, who took the knife away from him. lIe coontinued his address for Eeveral minutes in the same infuriated style, at one moment defying the Court and the imploring meroy for the sake of his two beautiful and iumo. cent children. He vehemently declared he would peril his souls salvation that he was innocent. (Sensation.) At length, being somewhat exbausted by his own vehemence, he asked for some water, which was given to him* and, after declaring that he had not had a fair trial, and that his counsel had altogether mistaken bis defence, he implored the Court to bear in minad that he had already been 14 weeks in. pri8n. MrsdOrCAMPBELL then Eaid the defendant had been convicted by the jury of the offence of selling obscene publications which tended to corrupt the morals of the yosung The case was proved by the clearest evidence; and, though he had been defended by one of the most eminent members of the English bar, who had done everything he could in his defence, the case was too strong, and the juyr, in the discharge of their duty, had found him guilt,. rt was shocking to see a man of the prisoner's years abandoning honest industry and trying to procure a scandalous livelihood by the sale of such infamous ptsblications. It was unnecessry to enlarge on the turpitude of such conduct.i but, is an example to others engaged in the traffic, which was sore pernicious to society than the crime of poisoning (as in the case of William Palmer, to which the defendatit had referred), the mildest sentence that he (Lord CampbeU) could pass was that he be imprisoned in the House of Cor. rection and kept to hard labour for one year. The defendant was then removed, William Strange, the other defendant, then stood forward to receive sentence, and, addressing the Corrt, said he bad been connected with the publication ofE cheap literatuo all his life; that he was in the habit of selling thousands of cheap papers every week; thatb he knew nothing of tboir contents; but that they all came in and were sold in, an hour to the trade. He said he had a wife and family to support, and if he were taken away of course they nust suffer. He solemnly declared he did not know the contnbts of these ublications. lord 8AMPBELL said he could not believe but that,the defendant was fully aware of their chbaacter. He could not have sold them without well knowing their nature; it was imporsible. The defendant assured his Lordship that he did not. Lord CAMPBELL said he felt satisfied the defendant must have vweU known the character of the publications. His Lordship felt it to be his duty to pass such a sentence on the defendant as would deter others from following his. examule. He had in this instance examined the publicat' ons forhimself and found them to be most infamous, and hen he heard that such publications were sold -by thousand4 his Lordship thought it was high time that an example sh uldI be made. As, however, it was the defendant's first offe ice, the sentence would be three months' imprisonment, but without the infamy of hard labour, in the hope that he imight yet reform, and become a respectable irembe r of society. The defenidant was then removed.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. WEsTfimsL'gFL MAY Vi _- - l'ITZPATRICK V. DIT.T-AN vitings at Ni3i PriUS, after Term, before Lord Ohief Juttiee pCaniuRuTR XIn s was an action brought by Miss Emma Fitzpatrick, the actress, to recover 1131. 14s. 4d. from the defendantl Mr. Charles Dillon, the lessee of the Lyceum Theatre, for salary and damages for the non-performance of an agree. ment entered into with the plaintiff to give her 81. per week for the last theatrical season, for playing parts in " high and fashionable comedy." Mr. Serjeant Shee, Mr. Huddleston, and Mr. Jonsa Levy peared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Warren, QC., and Mr. Mfurray for the defendant. Mr. Serjeant SHEE stated the case for the plaintiff, who, he said, was known in this country and America favourably as an actress in the higher classes of comedy The action was brought on an agreement entered into ilth lb. Charles Dillon to engage her in acting the parts she performed at the Lyceuma Theatre, at a salary of 81. per week. After a short period, instead of aaiirani to her the characters to play he bad agreed to do, he .ane to her characters in low comedies, burlesques, and mielo. dramas, such as the character Qf Zephyrina in Belphetor; or, the Jfountebank," which she declined to play. It was then,proposed to her to accept an engagement to playat the Grecian Saloon, whish she declined to do, and to go into the proVinCes on her own account, which she also declined. But she had consented to a proposal to go to Sheffield and play on behalf of the defendant. After a short time she received an intimation that her services were no longer required, and that the season was over on the 12th of December last, which was not the case, and she had been driven to bring this action in order to recover the salary agreed to be given tohher under her engagement, and damagesforthe breach of it. The learned counsel then called the plaintiff in the action, who stated the above facts in detailin her examinaLtion. Miss Emma Fitzpatrick, the plaintiff, examined by Mr. HUDDLESTON.-She lived in Brompton-grove, Bromteon. Her profession was that of an actress in gh and fashion. able comedy. She was negotiating with Mr. DiUon %bout an engagement before the season in July last year.' She then received a letter from Mr. Dillon's father, acting as his agent, of which the following is a copy:- " I mh*U beo most happy toenge you for theleeum. and wll give FM ~8 perwvees. I can givebyouno more. Mm V.UDillon wlU notinleterse with you. Parts will be written for you.

Your answermtustlbe byreturn MrI. Dillon voIU do all be can to tusks you comfortable, and if i48 wil suit you we wil close with you at once." Thie letter resulted in an agreement on the 8th of August. The agreement waa put in, and was as follows :- Th ise Fitzpaootric en gage s for the enti og sea son to play at the cehtainle Ro tal L c um .

Mr. aBUDI)DETON.-It did not mean 99Sally in our Alley 2" The Crrrnr JSunmx-You cam scarcelyv expect the lady to answer that. The witness continueol.-Zepbyriaa in BeipWeo? would certainly niot come under the designation of fashioniable comedy, The claracter was a very vulgar fourth-rate comedy part. This chater Mis Woolgar had plyed at the Adelphi, butit was a much higherrate of character. Orlearning that she wsas announcedtoperform in this character shewrote toMr. Barrett, the stage-ianaerof the defendant, to decline the part. Mr. Barrett mid he had asked MiEs Woolgar to play, but Bhe declined it. Subsequently another lady played it. She was then cast on the opening night for the Wcdding-day. Thet was her business; but it was fixed for half.past I in the morning. She said to M r. Barrett he was grieved at this, as it did not place her in hertrue position. He said, " You had better, then, at once dedline to play it," and he sent Ir. Dilon to me. She did Flay it. The piece began at 20 minutes past 1 in the morning, after most people had left the theatre. She was afterwards asked by hlr. Barrett if shewould go into the provinces to act for four months On her own account and suspend the enpagement The CIIIX JUSTICZ.-A kind of honourable exile. Witness (laughing .-Yes. I declined that engagement. Mr. Barrett said they were only going to play melodramas, as that was Mr. Dillon's line, and he could not play any other till he felt his footing. About this time she received an application from Mr.Conquest, the proprietor of the Grecian Saloon. Mr. Conquest was the father of m Dillon. Mrs. Dillon said she vwould do anything to oblige them, and if she would go to the Grecian Saloon they woud make her salar 2l. a-week more, and make it 1W. a-week. She declined this ; it was an inferior position to perform at such a place. On the 6th of October she was asked if she would go to Sheffield to perform there, as it would ease the treaury. Mr. Dillon was the proprietor of the Sheffield Theatre. She agreed to this provisionally. On the 13th *of October she received a letter fron Mr. Barrett wishing a lDs of her parts to play at Sheffield. She sent them and agreed to play them, her expenses being paid, which she Etimiated at 4 per week, and her engagement to continue at 81. salary. Shpe wen to Sheffield and acted seven nights; at the expiration of this time heh Waa told her services were not euied ey not ue her. She played Helen in th e tophth Constan in the ove Chsase, Harriet in ce he jeate t r this aho sent a telegraphic message t jo odon to know what she should do. She received no answer, and wrote several letters to Mr. Dion, to which she D eceived no answer. At the expiration of three weeks she returned to London. She paid her own expenses and received no salary. On her return she waa asked to paky itMriana and other part, int low comedy. She objected to do this, ax not within the terms of her contract. She was then informedl by'Mr. Barrett that the seaon closed on the 13th of December, and- she must talce her benefit on the 8th. To thi s ke bbjected` This was no benefit to her; quite the revem rsee said it'was? in her sareement, and she must take it. She told him the season did not then close; it was merely a cessation. for the Christmas pantomime. It was merely a subterfuge. He told her he should leep back all her salary as a uantee for her taldng her benefit. About 484 was due to er. The time fixed for her henefit was the very worst time possible - besides, she had no claim on the public, havin* only acted once. She finally Ybatened to put the matter mu the hands of her solicitor. H'er benefit came off on the 8th of December. It was avery excellent house-about 147&, but the cearges were very heavy. She was charged 801. for the expenses of the house. The printing cost her 141.; billstickers, 11. 14s. ; check-taker, one guinea; and advertising nearly 301. She got very little benefit. She was afterwards tendered her salary on the 12th of December, with a receipt in full of all demands, which. sbe refused to sign, because that was not the end of her engagement. The la3t night of the season was put on the play-bill of the 2d of April. She was obliged to go to the County Court for her salary, which was paid up to the 12th of December. Since then she had received no salary. The theatre continued opon till the 2d of April, when the season terminated. Her claim altogether for salary due was 1134. 14s. 4d. It wza not iBual for a manager to dclar the season at an end before Christinas. It was usual for the manager to make a farewell address, After a short conference between the leading counsel at the termination of this examination, .-Mr. WABBBE said he was happy to sav his dlent had assented to his advice, and terms honourable to both parties had been sreed upon. A verdict would be takei for the amount claimed, subject to terms as to the period'of payment. The CrEF Jusn=I-You have given your client very wise advice. I think no one who has heard this ovidence ca n doubt that the eeason was not closed. A verdict was then taken for the plaintiff for the amount claimed. SECONID COURT. (Before M(r.

COURT OF FXCHEQUEFL SATuRDAY. MAY 4- AlS!1I V. VRARVM (Sttnga at Kin Pnvt before the CUuEF BAozax Mr. Edwin Jamne, Mr. Serieant Wells, and Mr. Hawkins were counsel for tho plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Syles, Mr. O'Malley, and Mr. Couch appeared for the defendant. This was an action against the defendant as the acceptor of a bil of exchauge at two months for 356., dated the 6th: oi May, 185^, and drawn by J. T. Earradine, and endorsed to Jobn Haradine, andby him to the plaintiff The defon. dant by his plea denied the acceptance. The plaintiff is a surveyor, residing at Eynesbury, in the ceunty of Huntingdon, in which county the defendant resides, beingthe owner and occupiei of land to a considerable extent. Unfortunately forthis gentleman, he appears to have got into extensive bill transactions for some years before 1856 with a person named John Thang Harradine, who, after having forged the defendant's name to many instruments, eventually disappeared, leaving the defendant to get out of the consequences as best he might. One of these consequences was an action on an acceptance for 200X, which was tried at the last assizes for Cambridge, and terminated in a verdict for tho plaintiff. The questions raised I to-day were, first, whether the acceptance in queedion was in Ithe handwriting of Mr. Feary, and, if not, whether the ac- ceptance was not that of Harradine, as the authorized agent of that gentleman, and for which he was liable by reason of the general course of dealing in bil transactions. On the first question it was eventually admitted on all hands that the acceptance was in the handwriting of Harradine, and that he had no express authority for that act. The main question in dispute-and which was ultimately left to the jury-was whether the defendant by his aourse of dealing with Harradine before and during the Perpetration of several forgeries by him on the defendant, botf in the cuse of checks and hills, and even after the discovery of such irregul arities, had not qivers such currency to those lrregularities as to render him liable for this particular bill ia the hands of the plaintiff, who dLid not appear h have bad any knowledge of the connexion between e t and Harradine. The CriEz BARoN said the question for the ury wa whether the bil had been signed in a manner -emited by the conduct of the defendant The jury solved this question by findng a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the bill, 3561

Paul's Churchyard as town traveler, and on the foth of April last he received of a milliner of thenoame of Pary, who dealt with the prosecutors, the sumn of 41 SL 2kl'on their aocount, for which he h omitted to aocount. t Evidence was given of that fact, as well as in another case in whic n the prisoer wa chreged withe o ubtaing anne slk dresses by means oe fal e pretences. D Mr. Mrmshall said, as far s they had at present ascertaIned the prisoner's defalcations amounted to upwa' of 307. The prisoner was remanded.

She departed with the belief that she ad therdress she had purchaed, buthon epeningst parcel she found address of an inferior ality had beensubstitutea. Indeed,it was so inferior that it *as notworthmore thans.i ipet yard, and such dsuff her own dresses were usually lined with. Alnderman Huspsxy asked her if she was sure it wa not the same drews she had paid 31. 8s. 6id. for, Mrs Hart said the dre she purched had but one textare, but the one that had been substituted in the packing was msae with two textue, and the pattern of the ftoue and even the colour were different. She took the dress bhak, and Mr. Spence was excessively rude to her and refused to change it, and she therefore wished to know what was her best cours to obtai redress.

C. o aEL bow-sTeent.-Mr. P. teaderson, grocer, of Seymour. street, Camden-town, appeared to a summonsgchargig him withselinga mixture of "rcofffee and chicory as pure corffee on the 3 of February last. The proeoeution w as coducted by the loard of Inland bevenue, one of whose officers deposed to bavis visited defendants shop on t he day in quetion andw tske for o ounces of "purecoffee. Theshopman gave hi i packet, toh contents of which were subsequently analyred by the official chymist, and proved to contain a proportion of chicorzy. The defenacnt stated that his nt hade reved ample instructions to observe the new regulations upon4 his point and they assred him that in no case bad they sup. plied the mixture whend pur" coffee had been applied for. He felt, therefore, completely at the mercy of the Excise witness, for ittwas imnpossible after the lapse of more than three months e recel the cirutstances attencing this particular purchase. The paer in which the sarund produced was wraipped up was anle any Pape used inhi s he butfhe c d offer no evidence after such pdelay. Mr. HENRY consented to mtnbigate the penalty to 251 (one fourth.) IMr. IL Perry, grocer, of 33, Gorwell-street, was sum[mond under precisely similareircumstanoes, the purchase being made at the end of January last by an Eoxcie ofrioer mamed John Cooper. Mn Levis, inn. apn-ared for the defendant in this case, pazntdcr.sea mihn e' dtbtl ehni sntupitd am r--ew&ie .-itness at some length. Cooper swore that the asdistant who served him turned round and took the coffee down from a soelf at the back of him, pour- n itroutof ati daor wooden box intothe scales; but orn benmg questioned by Mr. Lewis and the Court he wunable to give any notion of the size of the box-did not know whether it was a box or a canistr-coul not sayoif it was tin or wood-believed it to be wood and subsequently dleclared it to be tin-and finally declined saying if it 'was painted, althogugh positively certaini it was not unpainted. Mr. Lepwis cledl two of defendan's assistants who swore that coffee was never kept upon the shielf, hut was invarlibly taken from a drawer more than three feet wide, and drawn out from under the counter. One of the officers of the court having been sent in a cab to examine the premises confirmed the statement of the witnesss.

One of the supervisors here explainedl the "routine" of this department of Government operations, showing the number of hands through which the " samplesP had topes, and the time consumed in the necessary " reports," " minutes," " orders of the Board," &o., before the magitterial summons could be formally applied for and served; from which, combined with the extensive jurisdic. tion of the Board and the number of cases oc.crring the Courtwould perceive that the delay of three mon& at least was inevitable. Mr. HEmRY, considering that an officer whosespecial business it was to watch every detail onght to be more preease in his evidence, digmissed tho smmons; and in a t ird case, against Mr. G.

The complainant, in common withlnumerous other gentlemen, had proteted against such treatment, and it was im consequence of an attempt to resit it in this inXsnoO that his client had been subjected to the insult and violence he should now prove. Mr. Miller then sated that he was a holder of % first. clan Snreebrook ticket on the 23d ult., and on reaching the terminus was admitted by the defendant into a carriage of a train about to start.

On Saturday the officers and men of the depOts of the 32d, 35th, 61st, "0th, 81st, and 87th (Royal Irish Fusileers) Regiments were formed on the parade ground of the Provisional Battalion, Chatham, after which they marched to 7he Inner lines, where they were inspected by Colonel H, Jervis, commandant of the Provisional Battalion, who e-xamined their new clothing and necessaries. The number Of troopsfunished by the above depots for their service companies in India is about 500, the whole of whom are ready for embarcation. The Princess Charlotte, 104, sailing three-decker, Cap. tain George St. Vincent King, C.B., &c., fitting out at Portsmouth as a floating barrack for troops on the China station, is ordered to be out of hand by the end of the month. Cabins are bdeig fitted up for the military officers who may have to go on board her. The troops will sleep in hammocks, each manhavlngtwo blankets, whichis considered to be a much more comfortable wayof sleeping on board ship than on the hard boards of the deck. The Princess Charlotte will have accommodation for 1,000 men and officers, who will be berthed on the middle and lower decks. The ar=angements for ventilation and other sanitary necessities appear to have had great care bestowed upon them, with the wiew of preserving the health of those on board. She will te stowed with as much of the munitions of war as she can {conveniently be made to carry independently of the necessary provisions and stores for herself. She will not mount her three-docker armament, but only a dozen 32-pounders for special service. We mouh doubt whether the end of the present month will see her nearer Spithead than she is now. The MelviUo, 72, Commander Trollope, fitting for a hos. pital ship for the China station at Portsmouth, is leaky. To discover the defect she was docked, the dock pumped out, and waterenough left in the hold of the Melvile totest the per. meation. She remains in the dock. Whon ready she is ordered to embark the headquarters of the 23d Royal Welsb Fusileers, as before stated. Sir John Liddell, C.B., M.D., F.R.S., Director-General of the Medical Department of the Navy, on paying his spring visit to the Royal Naval Hospital at Haslar in the early part of last week, inspected the MelviUle and the Marine Infirmary of the dockyard.

It is 10 feet in length, of 36-pounder calibre, and weighs 3 tons. Its mould is handsome, and it appears to have been cast in 1846. It is in good preservation, withthe exception of a piece of the muzzle being knocked away. A suitable inscription wil be placed on the piece, and a council of the Mayor and Corporation will determine its site. The Beagle, 4, screw gunboat, Lieutenant Hewett, Sr. rived at Portsmouth on Saturday from the Mediterranean, to be paid off. The Devastation, 6, paddle-sloop, Commander Marshall, arrived at Spithead on Saturday from the eastward; and 'the Buffalo store vessel from the same locality in the afternoon. The Adventure, 6, iron steam troopship, Commander Lacy, had her compasses adjusted in Portsmouth harbour on Saturday afternoon, and will embark her allotment of the troops for China this week. The Wallace paddlewheol steam tug, bought into the service for the Mediterranean, arrived at Portsmouth on Eaturday night, brought home by some of the crew of the hialacca screw corvette. The Spiteful, 6, steam sloop, Commander Shortt, arrived at Spithead during the night of Saturday from the Mediterranean, convoying the Fancy gunboat, and left yesterday afternoon for Woolwich, to be paid off. By the Spiteful we learn that the Gladiator steam frigate is not far off Portsmouth, and that the Malacca is coming home under sail, some derangement having occurred in her machinery. The Amphitrite, 25, sailing corvette, Captain Tatham, and Devastation, 6, steam sloop, Commander Marshall, left Spithead yesterday evening for LiverpooL The steamers Beagle and Lynx, from the Mediterranean, arrived in Plymouth Sound on Friday.

An Addmiralty order has arrived at Chatham for the Win <Chester, 50, late flagship on the China station, to be paid -off into ordinary to-morrow. The Winchester has been dismasted, and is almost entirely stripped. Her stores have 'been removed into the dockyard.

GENERAL ASHBUZ"HAM. (From the Examincr.) Tbis fitness of the appointment of General Ashburnhar., ta the command in China has been questioned on '&he ground that on a memorable occasion he adhered to t*,e letter of his instructions against their obvious spirit and 'mtent, and finaly esecuted a movement in the GuppO d face of the enemy with the introduction of a halt in a dAtch, when a charge might rather have been expected. Tb is is all that wa3S known of him, ay the objectors. Lord tanmure cam. mends the General's conduct on the very *.viciasion in question, and holds forth on the virtues o£ strict obediene to orders, citing the Duke of Wellin s treatment of an officer who, acting upon his owajudgnt, had moved from his post and exposed the army to atlamsging attack. On the other hand, how many instances may be quoted of the exercise of discretion against orders which has had the great Captaiu's appromil. Th.ere is On3 remarkable instanuce, indeed, in wvbich Picton 'datly refused to obey the Duke's repeated order, and upon the second ref neal the Duke simply remarked, " Well, I sapposedhe has good reason for wvhat ae is doing." Of coatrse the rule mutst be oboedience, but exceptions are allowable then the letter of the order is clearly inu conducive to the object, or actually adverseto it. Ad such was the ease at Rhedawallah, when some ground was to be cocupied by Brigader Ashburnbam's troops in order that the artillery might throw up batteries on it, so as to be ready to open fire at daybreak. The Generals orders vwere to seise the post at 4 o'clock am,, and to this he adhered, though it was certain that if his troops did not do their work till that hour the artillery could not do theirs at the time appointed. Sir H. Gough, inhis despatch, alluded to the derangement in his plan of operations AS referable to a misconception, for so he termed a tenacity to the letter of an order defeating its obvious object. When the Brigadier did move he wa in so little haste as to have made that hale in thee ditch, upon which there hes been so much disagreeable commeut. Kt may'have been to get his troops into order, deranged as their ranks may have been by a march in darkness, but -it was an awkward circumstance after the. provoking delay. BaLlakava is a memorable instance of obve&ience .to orders in the face of almost certain destruction; but there the obedience was in the direction of action, and the spur was given to the order from the rear by the enemy in front. The very opposite was the RhodawaUah affair. The coolness 'which General Ashburnham showed on that occasion mayi however, have recommended him to employment in tropical China. But he has other merits. He cleaned a very dirt' place. Might he not, then, have been usefolly employed In a department through which a memberof Her Majesty's Government desired to tam the Serpentine river? It was, however, rather surplusage in Lord Paumure to defend General Ashburnhamns character in particulars when he had so powerful, so conclusive an argument, as is conveyed in these words:- " As a reward for his gallantry in Indta I ma remind your Lord. shps that he was appointed aidde-d-camp to his Sovereign, ahd that he ao receired the crder of the Bath, rhich proves that his conduct in the field must have been satisfactory, or otherwis he would not have heen recommended for these honours." Q. E. D. So, with similar ogic in Fra Diavolo, the Minister says the decisive proof that there are no brigands in the country is that none have been found by the troops sent in search of them. Unfortunately the honowrs of tho Crown have been so bestowed lately as to lose currency in public opinion. Indeed, decorations have come to inspire more distrust than respect. Some have doubtless been uwell merited, but others have notoriously becn conferred wfhere punishment was more due than reward. And of this truth Lord Panmure must be conscious, though he may excuse his own part in the matter by the fact that he did not know what the conduct of the objeots of favour had really been when he consented to their reward. In the Russian war the rule was generally, first come firstserved. The officers who first sickened of their duty, and came home on urgent 'affairs, were the surest to be promoted and bedizened with orders and ribands. The beat things were all disposed of before the men who stuck to their colour_ found their way home. Two or three years hence, if it should please the Horse Guards to recommend Lord Cardigan to an important command, imagine a Minister of War proviug the fitness of the appointment by this argument --" As a reward for his gallantry in the Crimea 'may remind your Lo.dships that he was appointed Inspector of Cavalry, and that he also received the Order of the Bath, which proves that his conduct in the field mast have been satisfactory, or otherwise he could not have been recommended for those honoursa" Now, there are offlcers who find as much fault with Lord Cardigan's conduct in the Balaklava retreat as with General AshbUrnham's in the RhodawalUah ditch, and the public has, through themr learnt so much of the traths of that famons affair that iLt will not accept his Lordshipls rewards as evidence that he performed the duty of doing his best to rally and brinz off Ms repulsed and disordered troops, however gallantly he had acquitted himself in the charge, which, after al, was the less trying half of the commanding officer's duty. Bat it is ruled absolutely that junior officers are not to give their evidence against their seniors. They are to be tongue-tied. They are to see shortcomings and faults, they are to see them rewarded as meritorious emamples, and they are not to dare to say" Thus didst thou." A nd if -they tamel obey this law, they may, through their very obedience to it, see an incompetent, unworthy man thrust up into a command over them, in which their lives, and what Is as dear, their honour as soldiers, may be sacrificed through hisincapacity or recreancy. The persons who have the best opportunities of judging of a commander's conduct are those who serve under him. They are often hard and hasty, nay, prejudiced ir their judgments, and we do not mean to say that it ispovitlc to encomra_e or torelv on all their complaints, hut, on the other hand, it would be a great error to impose too peremptory a lawr of silence and sufferanoee We do not deny that there is truth in Lord Panmure's general proposltion'tas to the right treatment of high mili tary appointments, and especially in his condemnation of premature approbation-- " I think that when general offloers are appointod to distnt and important commands the greatestcare should be taken a5Dinat their being held up to public sco,n or premature public approbation. Either way is wrong (her), for they are incited to do something which may either maintaiu the credit which has been premat rely given to them, or which may disprove the accusastous wbich bave been uUt heaped upon them. (Hear, hear.) It ia wrong to put an officer insucb a potion, You ahould not lead hIs men to expect more from him than hlsformer Profersional reputation justifies, and than is expected from every Britlshofficer. You should not run him down nor hold himupto the contempt of his men,forby odoirig souweaken his authority., But, unfortunately, the absence of all Inowledge of General Ashburnbam challenged information ; it was a void to fill which the tide of evidence rushed in. Azs TIe Times says : " Evrybody was asking, 'Who Is General Ashbumnham? What has he done? There was no one to answer. The single line in the 'List of Services' in the Army List told vory little It was Invidious to say anything aginst a man of whom nOthing was knownl either for or sgainst him. People did, in. deed, aak how it was that when some scores of Britsh offioers of suffil dent rank had just acquired experience and distinction in a Rusaisn war they were al passed over for a man whose last aervices were no more recent thaan.1Si6 What genel had we got fiom the Crimea, which was to teach us so much aud provide us with so many rovedA soldier? So it was, however. Lord Pan. mare did elude criticism for a time by falling back to the anteOnmean period of our miliatry annals. We had been prepared to defend the claims of General Pennefather, and to this day we see no good reason why he was not appointed. But It was said that his health or strength was no longer equal to the takr, and that gave a colour to the new choice. However, by the time General Ashburnlham was actually embarldng we began to hear from his cndin ontemPOrarleS-othIla than tho-e who have incurred Lord Paumure'e indignation by going into print-the most positive teetimony that Genrral Ashburhaam, tbough what is commouly caled a good ofier, Is not a man of that dash, that selreliance and enterprise, necescary for the leader of a comparatively sml forcethathastoactuponanimmensepopulation Thesetestimonies we thought It better for a time not to publish. When, however, It reached us as amatterof news that at Malta enueral Ashburnham had been too unweil to attend at a paraee given in his honour, the omen-for such we derrihbed it-corroborated our Previous misgiving, and we expressed Ourselves in a way which, as fArd Panmuresa elicited numerots letters on the subject. Though from unex=s,m quarte mand from mnen of great autihority, they agreed with what we had heard, and we ha no choice hut to publish them." It is some comfort in the worst case that he must be a bad general indeed who is not good enough, backed by British soldiers, to beat the Chinese As the flowery people philosophically observed of their helplessness in the Tormer war, " Flints are harder than eggs."
SrRious ACCIDBNT.-PORTSMOUTr, Sunday.-A very serious accident occurred in Portsmouth Dockyard yesterday morning to several of the crew of Her Majestys state yacht Victoiia and Albert.

A party of ix of her crew were at 'w!ork cleaning her copper op a temporary stage slung along. ade the vesse, as isusual ii such cases. The supports of this stage gave way, and al on iLt were precipitated to the basement of the dock, a lal of 15.or2D feet. Three of the pooi, fellows sutained such injuries ea necessltated'their im. mediate removal to the Roy Naval lowpitals at Ha ser.

RSOWfA ITALIAIf OPERA. The reviral of 12 go1dto, Signor Verdi's best opera, has been brilliantly successfuL The fuDest house of the seasbn was assembled to witness its second performance on Saturday night, and seldom was an entertainment more hearty enjoyed. The very strong cast of Rigoletto at the Royal Italian Opera, every one of tho principal characters being filled to Perfection, wold alone be an attraction, independently of the claimsof the music, and the engrossing interest of the piece-ono of the most painful of modern dramas, and one of the loast morally satisfactory, since, while the poor Court fool, who earns his bread by flattering his master and turning all else into ridicule, experiences terrible retribution for a single fault, the heartless profligate, who allows no considerations of right to stand between him and his desires, escapes scot free to the tune of "LA donna e mobile," which though so popular with the. l3dies (especially when sng by Mairio) is a libel upon their sex. True, the fault of Rigoletto is a grave one, and he is punished where he has sinned by witnessing his own. child disgiaced in the same manner, and bythe same vile agent, as the daughter of Count Monterone, of whose woes he has made a jest for the edification of the. Court, and whose solemn curse he brings down upon his own devoted head Nevertheless, it is scarcely poetical justice to let the Duke of Mantua (we quote the dramatis persona of the Italian version) flit through the scene, from end to end, like some gay butterfly, rather an agreeable and sympathetic object than otherwise, his crimes being so notorious and openly avowed. Rig2letto has at least one virtue, while the Duke is destitute of any; and at the Eame time the former is a slave, who lives by assuming to be other than he really is, the latter a despot, responsible to no one whatever. With Lucrezi ,8rgia Victor Hugo much- more successfudlly carries out an idea very similar to that which is developed in Zle i amuwc. The Duchess of Ferrara, though steeped. in infamy, has one redeeming trait-her attnchcxent to Gennaro; and her crimes ae fearfully avenged when she.- herself is made the involuntary means of compassing the death, by poison, by her passionately beloved son. Of Rigoletto we only know that in public he is the Duke's' jester; while, in private-we judge from his soliloquy after the interview rith Sparafucile-heis something of a philo-' sopher, appreiating at its proper value the degradatfon of his own position, and entertaining a hearty contemrt for. haypocrites and courtiers. All of this is perfectly consistent and in keeping with the tender remembrance of his lost wife, the only human being that ever looked on him' with. "El s,xiia, quell Wangelo. Piet del!e mie Deneotlo. difforme, povero, Per oompas,idn Mt amo-" and also with the clinging affection for his daughter G,lda, the fear of whose contamination by contact with that society which he so thoroughly hates and despises haunts XIgoletto night and day. And yet the miserable jester is visited for his solitary offence with even greater severity than Luorezis Borgia for her countless iniquities while that unmitigated scoundrel, his master, unhurt and unabashed, pursues his shameless and unprincipled career. Mozart and DQ Ponee might, with almost equ2l fairness, have consigned Lseporello to perdiffon instead of Don Giovanni, the ready and unscrupulous servant standing in about the same relation to his dissolate patron as Rigoletto to the Duke of hlantua. Bnt vith regard to the itory and the music of this succesful opera by Signor Verdi enough has been said; and we have now only to speak of its performance. The reutrn of that great and well-deserving favourite of the public, MaSdme Angiolina Bosio was an event of more than ordinay interest, and Madame Boeio's impersonation of Gilda is probably the best ever seen, and her execution of the music equally beyond comparison. Rapidly as this aocomplished singer made her way in the estimation of the English public, it was as the unfortunate daughter of Rigoletto that she first stamped herself in universal opinion as an artist of the highest order. Praise has not been influential in spoiling Madame Bosio; on the contrayr, it seems to have had a beneficialtendency. At any rate, instead of retrograding, as so many do when they attain the pinnacle of fame, she still advances-a proof that she persists in devoting herself conscientiously to the study of her pDrofession. The Qilda of Madame Bouio, is, if possible, even more finished and complete than before. Her snging-from the first duet with Rigoletto, where the anxious jester unbosoms himself to his child, and warns her againstthe damer of the city, to the last quartet, where the unhappy girl, through achinkinthewallof Sparafucie's house, becomes aware or the infidelity ef her lover, and yet connot find it in her heart to detest him as he merits-was admirably perfect in every respect. As a display of florid execution, the air "Caro nome che il mio cor" may be mentioned with unqualified eulogy, and of expressive vocalization we could scarcely desire a more charming exam pe than Ws contributed in the duet with Gualtier =aldd, when the Duke of Mantua wooes Gilda in secret, at her father's residence, disguised as a poor student. wEow delighted were the public to welcome Madame, BoBio was shown in the unrestrained applause that rewarded 11 her efforts, and the' recalls after her mnore prominent displays. No,reoeption, indeed, could have been more genuine. Of Ronconi's masterly and impressive delineation of the Court buffoon, which in tragic power occasionaly rises to the height of his Count Chalard,while the admixture of low comedy,in certain scenes, imparts a variety which va ries and enhanoes the draniatic interest; of the eay,. gentlemanly, and irresistible demeanour of Mario inthe character of the Duke of Mantua, in which the exquisite singing ofthe great tenor is on a par with his acting; and of the charaKterstic and striking embodiment of the two secondary though very important personages, Sparafucile, the asassin, and Magdelena, his sister and decoy, by Signor Tagliafieo and me Nantier Didiee, we have only to reiterate the unqualified commendation bestowed in former seasons. So admirable a combination of talent, indeed, is rarely encountered, and, united to the- orong efficency of band and chorus, it accounts in a grest measure for the popularity Rjolejto has attained in The performance pssed off from beginning, to end' with theutmost spirit; the principal singers were recalled on several occasons; while the air, "Lx donna e mobile" (Signor Mfario), and the quartet, " Bella figla dell 'amore" (Madame Bosio, Signor Roneoni, Madame Nantier Didi6e, and Signor MIario), were unanimously encored.? On Thursday the Travia&r is to be given at this theatre, Matdame Bosio having lately essayed the part of Violetta with great SUGCceSS in Russia,
ST. MARTIzS HALL. The fourth and last of Mr. Howard Glover's "Educational Concerts for the People" attracted an overflowing audience The programme was one of more than ordinary interes, and called into request the talents of Mr. Sims Reeves, Mr. and Mrs. Weiss, Mr. Thomas, Mie Stabbach, Mis Theresa Jefferys, the Misses Brougham, and other popular singers; while instrumental music was represented by artists no less dLstinguished than Herr Ernst (violin), Signor Piatt (violoncello), and Mliss Arabella Goddard (pianoforte) Probably a richer musical treat was never offered to an audience, the majority of whom were admitted at the charge of " one shilling." The most gratifying incident, however. was that the best musio produced the greatest effect, and that nothing in the conoert created more enthusiasm than Beethoven's sonata in G for pianoforte and violin. The whole of this fine composition was performed (it is scarcely necessary to say how well) by Miss Goddard and Herr Ernst and listened to with eager attention, the audience not satWs fied with testifying their satisfaction by the heArtest applause at the end of each movement, unanimously insisting upon a repetition of the finak. After this who will say that good music, when intrusted to equally good players, cannot enlist the sympathies of a crowd? Of the rest it is enough to say that every piece was thoroughly enjoyed, and that the singing of Mr. Sims Reeves, above all, excited a sensation. The popular English tenor gave several songs, and none afforded more genuine satisfaction than Mr. Glover's beautiful setting of Shelly's Indian serenade, " I arise from dreams of thoe," which was rapturously encored. The accompanists at the pianoforte were Mr. Benedict, Herr Berger, and Mr. Glover himself.

EMREZZLUMENT BY A SUPERVISOR OF EXCISE.- On Saturday last the Mayor and magistrates at Rochester were engaged some time in the investigation of several charges of fraud and embezzlement committed by Thomas Redsell, late supervisor of Excise for the Rochester district. The frauds, it appeared, were committed as far back as 1853, at the latter end of which year the prisoner, fearina detection, suddenly absconded from Rochester, and went to residein France. An investigation of his accounts then took place, when it was ascertained that his defalcations were so considerable that the Board of Inland Reven-ae offered a reward of 1001. for his apprehension. Nothing. however, was heard of the prisoner until a few days ago when he was accidentaUy seen in Rochester by Mr. Naylar. a gentleman to whom the prisoner was indebted in aboa' 30-01. Redsell was then disuised in a rather singular .msuner, but Mr. Naylar causeg him to be apprehended, ani nmuediately afterwards proceeded against him on a wnrt of capie. On Saturday Redsell was brought up before tha anspstrates at Rochester in the custedy of the governor of Maidstoue Gaol, u~ja writ of habcas corpus. Mr. Dwellf, e solicitor to the Boird of Inland Revenue, appeared fir theprosecution, and-produioed evidence in snpport of tw, distict cases of fraud and embezzlemnent by the prisoner, in each*of. vwchisI3 ho had received the sum of 31. 6&.

2'HA rATE ZBXPLOSrOI A? L UNDHrLLTJ - . 8 SATUtDAY 4VM;sM. Since yesterday ten more bodies have been exhumed, making the total number now recoveroa 83. The first of the ten was recovered yesterday evening,after our despatch left, and could not be identified. The remainder have been brought to bAnk this afternoon. ETght bave been identified as the bodies of the following miners: -Richard Pullin, of Wombwell; Edward Garbutt, of Lundabll and his two sons, William and John Garbatt John Gnmshaw, of Wombwell, brother of Joseph Grimshaw, whose remains were recovered yesterday; John Russell, of Hemingfield; William Maugham, of Wath; and Philip Darltsof Broombill "trammner" to Maugham The other body, making up the ten, could not be identified it had been greatly mutilated by the violence of the explosion. Nearly the whole of the above-mentioned bodies were found in the third boardgate, or main road on the north side of the pit, and within a few yards of each other. It is known that they were all working within three or four yards of the place where they were found. At 3 o'clock yesterday there were 30 bodies lying in the reception shed; 11 of these were interred yesterday even. ing, and the remainder this afternoon. The following 11i.e., James and Edward Pollard, William linggwortb Edward Simmonds, Joseph Grimshaw, James and Charles Walker, Richard and Thomas Wilkinson, John Harper and Amos James, with five others not known, were conveyed for interment to Darfield church this afternoon, followed by a large number of their relatives and friends and mume. sou spectators, many of them weeping with great bitter. nes, and forming a 'verY mournful cort?ge. An incident occunrred on the way which created a very painful sensation Among the mouners was a Young married woman named Ann Brookes, sister to the widow of Amos James. Brookes was taken soddenly ill on the road, and died there before any assistance could be rendered to her. Her body was removed to the house of Mr. Hinchbold, publican, Darfield, where it remai;s to await the coroner's inquisition. It is blieved (hut not postively known) that she was labouring under disea of tbe heart, but that death was accelerated by gref and agitation on account of the melancholy fate of her brother-in-law, AmosJames. Though the work of clearing awray the fall proceeds more slowly thau it was at first hoped, we understand that the different relays of men work with the greatest vigour and good-will, each relay triving to outdo the other in the amount of work and the numnber of bodies which -it recovers. Some few of the men, with the greatest desire to con. tinue at the ork, have been compeled to relinquish it, from the effects of the impure- atmosphere. The great majority, however, suffer but little incwnve'ience, and stick to their dingreeable and dangerous task with most prais. worthy zeaL. The furtber the work of clearance proceeds the greater are the evidences of the almost unparalleled violence of the explosion. On the north dde of the pit, more especially, the strata and worldng apparatus are found to oe torn and dashed to an almost incredible degree, proving, if the violence of the explosion is any criterion as to the quantity of gas In the pit at the time of its occarrence, that the influx or acumulation of gas, from whatever cause, must have been very great. The bodies present the appearance, when found, of having died almost instntly, and the miners who are engaged ia the work of clearance ridicule the idea that any of those who have perished were alive when the shafts were closed, a few hours afterthe explosion, Meesmsr Nicholas Wood, Woodhouse, and Elliott, three of the superintending engineers, met at the pit this morning, with Nr. C. Morton, the Government inspector. Mr. Elliott descended and examined the pit as far as practicable. The engineers *pproved the proceedings of the viewers, and gave directions for the continuance of the work; ater which they adjournod until next Saturday.
THE LOSS OF THE CURLBW. Captain Charlewood, IN., and Commander Robertson, RN., the offic3rs who were appointed to institute an in. quiry into the loss of Her Majesty's rovenue cutter Curlew, presented the following report on Saturday:- " Board of Trade, May 9. "Sir,-In pursnance of the directions of the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade, Captain Charlewood, RN., on behalf of the Admiralty, and Commander Robertson, RN., on behalf of the Board of Trade, held an inquiry yesterday, the 8th inst., at the Privy Council-offlice into the occason and circumstances attending the sinking of the Coastguard cruiser Curlew, near the Mouse lightvessel, at about 1 a.m. on the 23d ult. and the loss of the master and as men, one only (Michael Hawkins) being saved out of a crew of eight in number, includingthe master. "After a careful consideration of the evidence adduced on the inquiry (a copy of which is annexed), we beg to report that in our opinion the loss of the Coastgnard cutter Is entirely attributa le to the neglect on the part of the master of that vessel in not taling the ordimnry precaution of exhibitinga lght, in accordance with the Admiralty regulations, which require 'that all sailing vessels at anchorim roadsSatd or fairways shall be bound to exhibit betweeansunset and sunrise a constant bright light at the " We exonerate the master, oflicers, and crew of the Belgien steamship Baron V3sy from all blame, us every necssry precaution appears to have been taken by them under the circumstances, the master, mate, and one man being on the lookout on the bridge, and one man on the lookout on tho forecastle, and the vessel proceeding at reduced speed. "The night, although so dark asto prevent a vesgel of the size of the Curlew being seen until within a few yards of her, was nevertheless sufficiently clear for lights to be visible at least three miles off. "The conduct of the captain, officers, and crew of the Scout, Coasiguard cutter, which was lying at anchor near the Curlew, and also of those of the Baron Osy. appears deserving of praise, for the prompt; manner in which they sent teir boats to the aid of the crewf of the wrecked vesseL.

EQUALrZATION OP POOR-RATR TO THE EDITOR OF THE TlIMS. Sir,-In discussing the question of equalization of the poor-rates the great fact should not be lost sight of that a vast proportion of the expenditure under the head of poorrates in the metropolitan parishes is applied to what is caUled the relief of the casual poor-that is, of persons who, being the surplus population of the rural distdets, make their wayinto the cities and townsin search of work. This again causes the labour-market in cities and towns to be overstocked and wages kept down to a pittance which larly enables the labourer to exist. " An East-end Incumbent" has taken up the notion of a "penny emigration rate." This is not original, because for many succesave years, at most of the meetings held in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, a ratepayer moved, an amendment to the amount of the rate of l. proposed by the overseers, that a penny should be added thereto, and the prooeeds-namely, about 1,1001. expinded in aiding respectaeoor raayerato emigrate. T&hisproposal was as con stantTy resis J tho cry of " You want to transport the people," and other e9ually sensible remarks. A petition to PFaflament% proposed by the same ratepayer, for adoption by the ratepayers, to procure an uniform rate throughout the kingdom in aid of emigration was equaly unsuccessfuL It was, however, presented to Parliament as the petition of the individua, by Sir J. Pakington, at that time Colonial Minster. Subsequently, the same rtepayer, being In possession of some nuggets of gold, went with them to ths workhouse, accompanied by anoverseer; the result was a petition by many of the poor incarcerated peoplo to be assistedtoemigrate, the sending the chaplain of the workhouseto seek advicoe from the ratepayer, an application to the Poor Law Commissioners, and the embarcation of 58 persons for South Australia, where, notwithstanding an attempt at opposition to their landig, after inspection by the coonial being by him favourab rev rted upon, they srerg landed, and found to be precisely the class of people the colony was Eo much in want of; they were all instantly absorbed, and none of them ever again became troublesome to St. MArtin's, or to the colony. Under the firm conviction that emigration ought to be treated as a national question, the ratepayer before-mentioned continues on every fitting occasion to press the necss8ity of agitating and gettin rliament to take up the question, as a means of diminiiiing crime, removing causes of pauperism, givingconstant valuable employment to all who are able to work, permanently relieving the ratepayer, and eradicating Many of the social evils under which society has long laboured. The only way to lessen the pr-rates andrnake them truly efficient is by preeaingParxamentto ranta aP&M.U_ St. Martin's Parh, May 6. EMIGRATION.
REAMS OP THE MOA.-On lfonday week, the 4th of January, Ifr. G. HI Moore, of Glenmark, in the northern portion of the province, discovered three of the finest specimens of the great Moa bird remains wbich have yet been found in this colony. His men, in tracing uD a drain through a peat swamp to the bpring at the foot of the hill in the rear of his woolshed, came across a number of huge bones in a very high state of preservation. Upon carefly excavating them, and removmg a depth of abont four feet of* peat, in which partly they were found, and below which was a blue clay, they discovered in one place the frames of two birds, and a few yards farther back the entire hones of another. The two former are of a great rize; the shank bones are upwards of two feet in lentlth and nine inches across the knuckle joints. The lower joints of these two birds appear to be imbedded perpendicularly in the blue clay, asif they had sunk beyond their powers of extrication, and the upper parts of their frames were found in the peat% which covered them entirely over. The position of the remains leads to the idea that these birds had all sought shelter from fire under the steep hill at the spring there, and were overtaken by the fire before recovering from their state of exhaustion. The peat and vegetable matter which appears to have been washed down upon them has maintained these remains in a very high state of preseriation. The greatest care is being taken by Mr. Moore to collect aU the parta, and it is probable! that the entire skeletons of atU three birds wliU be obtained. These fine specimens will doubtles throw addijioual light upon the peculiar structure of this remarkable birdt and add to the interest which is attached to the total diappearance of this extraordinary pecimnen of former natural history.-.Acw Zealand Paper. PFEn-PAmK, SALFoRD.-In the notice of the Salford Museum and Free Library which appeared in The Times of Thursday it was stated that the late Lord Elles. mere and the Bishop of Manchester were the main contribtutors of books and money towards the institution.
