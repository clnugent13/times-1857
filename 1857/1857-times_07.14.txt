THE FATAL ACcIDENT ON THE NORTHI KENT RAILWAY.-Yesterduy the inquiry before Mr. Carttar respecting the circumstances attending the deaths of the 12 persons consequent on the accident which occurred on the Nortb Rent lailway on Sunday, the 28th of June, was concluded at the Plough Inn, Lewisham. Some of the witnesses before examinedwererecalled, and the evidence given by the others merely corroborated the facts already known. Among the witnesses was Mr. Wilcox, whose wife and sister-in-law were killed by the accident. He saidthat within a minuto or two before the accident a guard was standing beside him, and on asking him how much longer he was going to stop he said they - would be off in a minuto or two, and that they had been stopping for the Beckenham train to pass on. Witness had seen the Beckenham train cross two or three minutes previous to his speakingtotheguard. Immediately after this the same man hallooed out towards the engine-driver, " Hughes, Hughes, Hughes" five or six times, and then whistled, and ran down the line. Ho heard a train coming up at a rapid rate, and on looking out towards Blackhesth he SAN, two lights just entering under the first bridge. He immediately jumped on the seat, and then down on the line; as soon as he fell, and before he could recover himself, the oollision took place. He scrambled and made his way to the station, and saw the carriages smashed. He rendered all the assistance he could in the hope of finding his wife and sister, when he heard some one say that the las't carriage was crushedby the engine, and, on going down the line, there ha found his wife and sister atnong the sufferers. He saw a red light before the train came into Lewisham station. The coroner having summed up, the jury, after conferring togetber for upwards of t,o hours, returned the following verdict :-"We find that John Griffiths sad Thomas Perry, labourers, are guilty of manslaughter in regard to the death of John Baringer, and also a similar verdict against the same parties in regard to the death of Horatio Turner. The jury also find from the evidence that the distance signal at the Lewisham station was not and is not so effective as, in their opinion, it should be, and also that great negligence was manifested from the fact that proper appliances were not carried by the engines, as ordered ly the rules of the company; and the jury cannot help expressing their regret that so much time should have elapsed before any assistance from the company arrived at the scene of the accident; they hkewSse express their opinion that more efficient mer should be placed to work the signals, and they further condemn the open third-class carriages of similar construction to those that were destroyed, as not affording sufficient protection for passengers in the event of an accident." Mr. Rees, the solicitor of the railway company, expressed on their behalf the sense they entertained of the great attention and patience which the coroner and jury had bestowed on this inquiry, and assured them that the recommendation of the jury shoulld meet with every proper attention. The court then adjourned till Monday next, for the purpose of recording a verdiot in regard to the cases of the other sufferers. TnE EXHIBITION OF ART TR.EASURES.-Printce Louis Napoleon and suite visited Manchester yesterday, by the express train from Liverpool, which arrived at 12-3).

TRE MUTINY IN INDIA. The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH.-My lords, I am anxious to put a question to the noble earl with reference to the news which haa been received from India, and the course which Her zMajesty's Government Intend to pursue. It is now three months since the minds of the most reflective men have been directed with great anxiety to the state of the army in India, and every successive mail has tended to increase that anxiety. But, notwithstanding this state of affairs, no one word of official informatioi has yet been given to Parliament, We have been left to depend upon private letters and upon articles in the newspapers, while the empire is in danger. We know nothing of the cause of the danger or the nature of the measures adopted by Her Majesty's Government to suppress it. I do not think that thisis a state of things that ought to continue. (Hear.) Ihave said that every successive mail increases our anxiety, and yet by every successive telegraphio despatch we are told that the crisis is past, that the danger is over, and that things have been at their worst. My lordst, it Is not so. In a case of this kind-of a dangerous and extensive mutiny-things go on from worse to worse, and so will proceed until the strong hand of power has interfered to suppress the resistance to the authority of the Government. As yet no indication has been given of the existence on the part of the Government of IndiA of that power which is necessary to suppress the present mutiny. The general tendency of those who call themselves the publio Instructors of the country is to endeavour to induce persons to believe that this is only a passing calamity, and that slight measures indeed are required to put down the rebellon in India. It seemss to me that there are many among us who resemble that sagacious animal which, when pressed by its pursuers, hides its head in the sand and thinks it is.not seen because it cannot see. All Europe Is regarding with the deepest interest the conduct which under the present circumstances we are pursuing. Upon that conduct depend our present character and our fature poSition in India. I do not believe that there exists in this House or in the other any indisposition to grant to Her Majesty's Govern. ment all the means they may ask for the purpose of establishing our authority in India. If we do not do right the disgrace is with the Government, the loss of India must undoubtedly be with us. -But it depends upon the noble lord at the head of the Government whether he sball obtain for himself a reputation similar to that which was obtained under difficult and dangerous circumstances by Lord Chatham, or allow his Government to go down to posterity as the most calamitous, the most disastrous, and the most disgraceful sin c the time of Lord North. My lords, what Her Majesty's Government have done since the last telegraphic communication which we have received is, so far as I am acquainted with their oonduct, right. They could not, I think, have appointed a better officer than Sir Coan Campbell to be at the head of the army in India. (Cheers.) I have at all times held the highest opinion of that gallant officer. I received it from the late Sir Charles Napier, who from the first moment of his acquaintancee with him formed his opinion, whichwaa afterwards fully confirmed, that he was one of the first officers in the Indian army. But in order to give fUl effect to the abilities of Sir Colin Campbell, two things are necessary; first, that in acting as Commander-in-Chief In India he should be altogether relieved from the thraldom which it has been too customary to subject commanders-Iu. chief in India to-the thraldom of politicals; the next in, that he should, as Lord Harris did in the time of Lord Wellesley, carry with him the whole strength and force and power of the Governor-General. It wa the pride of Lord Wellesley that he thus supported the offioer under his coin. mand, and we see whatsucoesses in the field rewarded his wiso and generous conduct. I approve theowiomeneure which has been adopted l-y the-Government in India in appoiitiDgtemporarily Sir Patrick Grant head of the army. ((Hear, hear.) I do not ask whether they are strictly and legally justified in making that appointment, nor is it to me a matter worthy of consideration. They have regarded the public interests in placing the best man they could find at the head of the army. In doing so they have deserved well of their country. (Hear, hear.) But, my lords, observe this, that on the arrival of Sir Colin Campbell Sir Patrick Grant will cease to hold the military command; and I mut say that I have long regarded it as an object of the greatest importance that the Governor-General should have the aid of Sir Patrick Grant as his military adviser in this crisis. It occurs to me that this great object can be effected in this manner-by enabling for a time the Court of Directors to appoint as sa extraordinary member of coenell a military officer, When once they ap. point Sir Patrick Grant, he will remain in council with the Governor-Genneral and aid him with his advice. There are already two respectable officers who act in that capacity -the one as military adviser and the other as military secretary. I respect them both for the creditable manner in which they discharged in previous situations their daties -the one as political officer and; the other as judge-advocate. But there was nothing whatever in their previous services which could enable them to give to the Governor-General that advice upon which ho may rely as an authoritative expression of that which it is right for him to adopt, and it is most desirablo that his councll should contain such men. I know that persons are very much disappointed at not having received by this telegraphic cotmmunication an account of the capture of Delhi I think that disappointment unreasonable. I did not expect to receive that account; nor do I think any one can fairly impute blame to the commander of our force that at the worst season of the year, and without the means of carriage, he should not have made a march of more than 130 miles in the time that wan anticipated. I understand, however, that our troops have succeeded in defeating a body of the enemy which opposed them in the vicinity of Delhi. This account brings two thipgs to my mind. The first is that the insurgents must have been rmuch stronger than we supposed if they were induced to go out beyond the walls of Delhi (hear, hear); and the next, I rejoioe to say, is that it impresses me with the conviction that they have no leader to command them. Happening to krnow the ground I am not in the least degree surprised that they should have lost all their guns; because in such a position it would be impossible for them when pressed to carry their guns with them. My lords, we hear that the defection is becoming very general-that it has extended to 26,000 men of the Bengal army. We hear more than this-we hear that in the Puniab all the native regiments have been disarmed. lTow, among those regiments thereare two of which Ihappen to know the recent history-viz., the 16th Grenadiers and the 26th Light Infantry. The 16th Grenadiers was one of the noblest regiments of the Indian army. It bore on its colours almost as many records of actions fought and victo. ries gained as any regiment in Her Majesty's service. It was brigaded with Her Majesty's 40th Regiment during the whole of Sir W. Nott's operations in Affghanistan. It served at Maharajpore, andby the side of the 40th Regiment it equalled the Queen's troops in courage, fortitude, and devotion, and lost as many men. The 26th Regiment of Light Infantry distinguished itself under the command of Sir G. Pollock When Sir G. Poilock joined the army 2,800 men out of the whole 4,000 were in hospital, the majority of whom Esunered more from their owvn apprehensions than from any actual sickness. The only troops, under those circumstunces, upon which Sir George Pollock could entirely depend were this 26th Regiment, which has just been disarmed. My lords, there must have been a continuance of mismanage. ment and misconduct which I cannot oomprehend before the nature of the soldiers composing those regiments could have been so changed. There cannot have been one non-commissioned, and certainly not one commissioned, native officer in those regiments who did not show his gallantry and fidelity under General Nott and General Pollock; and it is lamentable to think that the glories of two such regiments should be obliterated from the Indian army, or that any circumstances, whatever they may have been, should have occurred to alienate them for an instant from the Government, and to make the officer in command think it necessary to deprive them of arms which they have always borne so nobly and so successI fully in the field. (Hear, hear.) It becomes us, then, to look forward and consider, from the facts we have before us, what is likely to be our position in India on the 1st of November-the time when our troops will arrive, and when, after the rains, it will be possble to move. I have endeavoured, my lords, to form an opinion on that subject. I assume that we take Delhi-I assamue that our troops continue to hold Delhi, Meerut, and the neighbouring stations; but I know the locality. No Euro"ea,, regiments are ever stationed there on aoant of the sicklness which prevails; and at the end of the rainseven thenative reginents have fromtwo-thirds to three-fourths of their strength prostrated. T'herefore, if our troops take andl occupy Dehi, if- they expel the King froenhis palace and drive out all his forces, and even i, they do\everything in their power to promote the health of' our men, you cannot possibly expect them to be in a state to resume operations en the 1st of NRovember. AlU I can venture to hope is that they will be able to hold the places they occupy. In the very centre of the mutiny our troops wPil be like the French in Spain-they will hold what they stand upon, but little or nothing else. When the army which constitutes our strength is dissipated and gone, and the men have become, as they will do, rebels or robbers, it is impossible to believe that we shall be able to collect the,revenue and administer the government. Inthe Punjab things may be a little better. You have able men there, who, I trust, will be. able to maintain their own. They may perhaps be able, through the aid of the locall corps to collect a portion of the revenue, but I do not. th they can possibly do more. Certainly they will not be able to move beyond the banks of the Sutlej to render assistance to any other corps. A1l I can hope is that in these provinc our authorities wil stand their groand,' and that tne Punjsb will be maintained. 'With your lordships' permission I must enter into a few details, aud examine what force we really want; because it is idle to talk of sending out regiments unless we know what are the demands upon us and what the troops are to do when they arrive. When the insurrection first broke out we had only. two regiments at Calcutta and its nelghboaurhood. The Go-. vernment sent for one regiment from Madras, and two from; Bombay, which were in the Persian Gulf at the time. This, with another regiment previously ordered up, will make six regiments at Calcutta when theEe troops arrive. The first thiDg to consider is the protection of the capital, the seat of Government, where there is a treasury containing, many nmillions, and an enormous amuount of mercantile property.- It Is the point through wisich alone the Customs, the salttax, and the opium revenue can be levied. . It is essential to the maintenance of British authority in India not only that Calcutta should be held, but that there should be no possible doubt as to our holding it, and that the' Government should be always able to act and legslate there in perfect security. In addition to the troope there yon ought to have at least six stamers in the river to protect the Government offices, Ac. Allhabad is a most important station at the junction between the Jumna and the Ganges; while it Lucknow-the centre of a great Mahommedan population-there ought to be more than one regiment. Thus, the whole of the six regiments which will arrive at Calcutta will be required for the protection of Bengal alone, without the power of moviuf-beyond the confines of-that pre. sidency, and therefore they will have no disposable force for retrieving affairs at the other provinces. Of these six regiments three must, at the earliest convenient mao ment, be eent back to their previous stationsone t-o Madras and two to Bombay. Consequently of the eight regiments 'which we know have now been ordered to sail for India three will be detained in Bengal to supply the place of the corresponding number who win return to Madras and Bombay. Thus there will remain of the entire force of which we have as yet heard only five regiments for any operAtions from Allahabad. I hold that five regiments are totally insufficient. And here I ought to observe that whatever force the Government may send out the difficulties of the Goverqor.General in affording it the means of movement will not, perhaps, ba insuperable, but they will be enormous ; and unless he interferes in the business himself, looking into every detail: and communicating personally with the officers intrusted with the duty of furnishing transport for the troops, our meastres will entirely fal There is no use in having men if you cranot'move them. In Bengal you cannot flnz horses to monut the cavalry, or for the purposes of the artillery. It is absolutely necessary that the horses should be sent hence; and it is most desirable that yotz should at the same time give orders at 'the Cape and in Australia, for the furthering to India of allhorses fit for the servioe of the, cavalry and artillery. But I shaU assume that these five regiments have all reached Allahabad. They will not,. however, be there by. the 1st of November. That is the day onx which they will arrive at Calcutta and, having obtained the means of transport, they cannot possibly get to Allahabad before the 1st of January. This force will be wholly inadequpte to enter without cavalry or artillery into a country with frour 0,0O,000 to 40,000,000 of inhabitants, full of disbanded' troops, and containing. the really miltary population of India-the Rajpoot population. I say that youtr forci should consist of at least nine regiments of infantry, thre, regiments of cavalry, and six batteries of artiUlery.' Upon a late occasion Calcutta was left with only one battery of six gaus, and, although it is contrary to all our previous notions, it wiU be necessary for the first time to send-artillery to India. And now comes another difficulty. The gun carriages made here will be of no use there, and unless you send out orders to Madras and Bombay to provide gun carages those made in this country will crack m pieces, and your guns will be lost. My lords, I think I should fail in my duty if I did not say most decidedly that I do not think it sufficient to act. on that line of operations alone. There will be on the right bank of the Sutlej a force which mnay maintain its own, but which wUll be in jeopardy in the midst of agreatpopulation very warlike and. very hostile, and I hold it essential that there should be a movement of troops by the line of the Indus and tie Sutlej, which may conDect. itself with the force from Allahabad, and crush all opposition between those two points, And more, I hold it to be most expedient, wise.. and necessary to go yet further, and. to have some. reserve of perhaps two European regiments-one at Alahabad and another on the other line of operations I have indicated-to whichsome native regiments might be joined who might be relied on for the purpose of completing the communications, of send- ing up eanpphe, and protoet=Mg tvh r" f *Eo. ar,y_ .&d now* mg lords, wha3t force iA'eqnured ? Eivo tn..ents we have. I all throops ni in hina sre a ienrtoinda those five regiments woula lupplythe force required. I assume that three regiments could be spared from Bombay, and you require from eight to ten regiments of infantry, six of cavalry, and 12 batteries of artillery; and with these troops you must send horses, or they wil become immovable. I frmly believe that if Parliament and the Government will re-in-oree the army of India to the extent I have suggested you may with absolute certainty-subject to those unforeseen accidents which befal all miltary operations-calculate that by the end of April the authority of the British Government will be firmily established in every part of the upper provinces. Bat if you act in a different wayif you act undecidedly-if you think there is nothing in it, and that it will die out of itself-if you afe not determined to put forth your whole strength and crush this rebellion against your dominion which threatens your existence in India as conquerors, you maj depend upon it you vwill have entailedupon you campaign after campaign, and the suspense which will affect the minds of the whole people of india will imperil your rule and destroy your character and authority in india. My lords, I do not believe there willbe any indisposition on the part of Parliament to support the Government, if the Government take the right view of the present state of things, It is for them to decide. I trust that they will prove worthy.of the difficulties of their pDosition, and of the greatness of the danger in which we are all involved, and that by coming,forward in a manner to maintain the national character and the public interests, they will give permanent security to our Indian empire, ts well as honour-which I shall not gradge them-for themselves. What I wish to know from the noble earl is what measures the Government now intend to take for the reinforcement of the army of India, aud whether it is their intention to give, at the earliest period-th&t is, within three daysoficial information on the subject. (Hear, bear.) Earl GRANVILLE.-I think the noble earl was somewhat unjust to Her Majesty's Government in the beginning of his observations. I am nrot aware that any information has been sought for which has been refused by the Government. Her Majesty's Government have endeavoured to explain as fally as they can the events which have occnrred in the East. There will be no difficulty in giving every in formation either with regard to that which has been already received, or that wbich may be expected this eveningor to-morrow, an official summary of which will give full information to the country. I assure your lordships once for all-because there are ramours about that the Government possess disastrous intelligence, which they are not willing to communicate-that the object of the Government is not to conceal the real state of affairs, whatever that state may be. (Hear.) I would go at once into the history of all that we know, but I have very little to tell, for the public have been put in posseseion by electrie telegraph of the whole hubstance of what we know. The Government have only received three or four official communications by electric telegraph,-viz., by Malta, Maseilles, and Trieste, all agreeing in substance with that published by the ordinary channels of information, and the only addition I can make to it is that the lst telegraph received states that the Punjab *s perfeetly quiet. I can assure the noble earl that the Government do not treat this matter lightly. They consider this as a most serious question, and one most seriously to be considered, and they hold that it is their duty to take every precaution intbeir power, and to treat the matter as one of importance. But when the noble earl talksof calamity, disgrace, and disaster I cannot say that the Government sbhare in that opinion. Whatever they may think of this serious crisis, they are not disposed to prophesy, and I think that the noble earl himself, notwithstanding all his experience, would act more wisely and more safely for the publio if he' satisfied himsell with giving his opinion upon the facts he knows, and not upon facts based upon his imagination and upon the proba. bility of what is likely to take place. Of course, any sug. gestions from the noble earl, if not followed, will always receive, as they deserve, the careful consideration of Her Majesty's Government. With regard to those military de. tails upon which the noble earl has entered, I am incompe, tent to go into them, and even my noble friend (Lord Pan. inure), ana the illustrious duke (the Dake of Cambridge) behind me, however competent, will, perhaps, not think it convenient or desirable to follow him into those details, Bat so far as we are acquainted with what the Governor General has done-and I now speak for Her Majesty's G oG vernment-we are perfectly satisfied.and entirely approve every act brought to our knowledge which has been taken bythe Governor-General in dealing with these eveuts, In regard to the Government at home, they will not neglect to take every preaution to strengthen the hands of.the Governor-General. There is a notion, which may perhaps cause additional anxiety, that the Government possess information with regard to particular persons, but with respect to whom we have no information whatever. I regret to say that the melancholy news is too true that General Anson has died from cholera at Kurnaul; but the Government has nom received information of the death or illness of any other person. Your lordahips who knew the character of General Anson, and who appreciated his abilities, his sound under- StandinZ his clear judgment, and that presence of mind which Is eqully valuable in civil as weUss military mtters, WIl feel the great regret that the Government entertain at the death of General Anson. I think that the Governor. General has adtcd judicioualy in his temporary appointment, of Sir P. Grant; and I am grateful for the noble earls approval of the ending out of Sir Colin CampbelL Whatever may be the couse taken in his selection,every one must think that ifinite credit is due to that gallant officer in being ready to start fo,r Inda,. within a few hours after he was infonned that hissrvices wrere required. (Cheers.) I am not aware I can give the nioble eari any furiber information. The. noble earl argues as if there were a general insaurection, but' it has not extended beyond'-the arny. As to the regiment1 that have been disbanded we haverno knowledge that they had any eommunication with the rebels. MIer Majesty's Governsnent will give the fullest inforktioll to Parliament, and theceoant. Tbeywrvill actwith the greAtest lgo.r onthe present emergency, hut they will not give way to un- foandedapprehensions of any great caamity and dister. ! (Cheers.) Lord MELVILLE said that the condition of the Bengal army wa one to which his attention had xome tiine sinoe been directed, amd that the want of discipline which had recently been manifested in its ranks was a circumstance of no unusual occurrence. He had served with that army, and he 0'as therefore in a position to state the rexsons to which the difference which existed between it ana the Bombay and Madrns armies was to be attributed. The system of appointing natives officers in the Bengal army he looked uponUa one of the causesofthat,absence of discipline by which it was characterized, and probably of the rautiny which had lately taken plac. . Those officers, he might add, were, generally spedaing, selected, not for their merit or fitness tocomnmaud, and wereaaisedfromtherankswhenthey were old men,land when disaffection at-not having previously been enabled to obtain their discharge-from the seivico had, to a considerable extent, operted upon their minds, In the Bombay and Madras armies,, upon the contruy, a. different system prevailed. The havildas in those armies were selected for their intellignce and activity, and*er6 rebomieinded for promotion to that rank by the commanding officers of their regiments. But, be that as it might, nobody could deny that the discipline of the Bengal army was of the worst po6sible description, and in that light it had been looked upon by the late General Anson, who had in eonseqatence, ever sinoe he had assumed the command of the army in ITdia, deemed it to be his'duty to represent to tho Board of Directors the absolute necessityof inereasiog the European force in India-arecon. mendation towhich, however, so far as the Governmneht WaS concerned, no sort of attention had been paid. (Hear, heaF.) In proof of the statement that the discipline of the Bengal army was of the .worst description he might inform the House that in the year 1849, shortly after the first occupation of the Punjab, when he bad commanded on the frontier, t*6 Bengal regiments had mutinied, and when he had returned home in 1850 he had expressed the greatest disapprobation of the condition of the troops of which that army was com. posed. He had, howvever, been told that, no mrtter how just his opinions upon the subject might be, he must not give ,utterance to them in pnblic, inasmnch as £tb was extremely undesirable that foreign nations should. be acquainted with the. real state of affairs. The result, at all events, had been that no steps had been taken in the matter by the -Board of Directors, and that the discipline of the Bengal army continued to be of that character to which he had drawn their lordsbips' attention, He had had the honour of leading the Pun jab division of the Bombay army, and he had no hesitation in saying tbat nothing could be more praiseworthy than the conduct which the troops composing that division had exhibited. To show their lordships how different was the conduct of the Bengal army he might state a circumstance which had taken place atthe siege of Mooltan, and which had been reported to him by an officer who had been present on the occasion. A covering party had been ordered into the trenches, and some disturbance having occurred among them during the night the officer to whom he referred had gone to ascertain its canse. He had foundthat ith adarisenfrom the fact that some soldiers of the Bengal army had been endeavouring to prevent the men belonging to one of th6 Bombay regiments fromdigging in the trenchesindiacharge of their duty, observing that they were sepoys, and would fight, but would not work. Yet the officer in command of those Bengalese had not ordered them into confinement, notwithstanding that they had not done one bit of the work which had been ordered,by the engineers. Henmight also add that the morning after tho assault of Mooltan Mr. Lake had asked the officer in command of one of the pickets to post a sergeant and 12 men at one of the gates of the town. The officer had done so; but not long after the men had taken up their position three officers of the Beasal Eugineerg had come up, one of them having a loaded gun, and hearng netween the4 something covered-by xIee'of-tarpaulin, -whichtbey1 resented to be erigineering stores. They had been, however, told by the guard that they could not pass, and, thetarpaolln having been raised, that which they were in realitycarrying had been found to be plunder. But it was unnecesay to cite further instances in proof of the accuracy of the opinion which he had expressed in reference tc the spihitwhl%l prevailed among the troops of the Bengal army. He trusted, now that afitting opportunity of dealing with the subject presented Itself, Her Majesty's Gdvernment would' become alive to the necessity of reorganizing that army (hear, hear), and placing the whole system upon which it was based upon an entirely different footing. As to the exiting mutiny in India, he could not fnd in the fact that certain cartridges had been issned a sufficient reason tor its occurrence. It was, indeed, difficult to ascertain to what the- breaking out of that mu-tiny was immediately to be attributed; but of one thing he felt assured-namely, that the Government would act very culpably if they did not pay due attention to the representations which had been mnade tothem in reference to the want of discipline which prevailed among the regimnents of the Bengal army. (H:ear, hear. ) The Earl of ALBERAARLE said he attributed the exist ing discontent in Bengal to the fact that men of high caste were exclusively employed in the Bengal service, an din that opinion, he mibgt add, he was confirmed by - letter which he had received from Dr. Baist, the editor of the Bamoay 1mim.ea In Bombay, on the contrary, men of high and low caste were employed without distinction, and the result was that, although 10,000 men had been sent from that provinoe to the Persian Galf,.a disposition tomutinv had not even in a single instance been evinced among those troops. The mutiny whbich had occurred in 1825 at Barrackpore was altogether to beattrib- ted to causes having their origin in the prejudices of caste. The xubject was then allowed to drop. THE SWISS LEGION. The Earl of MALHES BURY, in ridsng in pursuance of notice to present a petition from the officers of the Swiss Lcgion, said that it appeared to him upon primd facie evidence that a hardship ad been inflicted on the petitioners. He wished, however, most particularly that their lordships should be persuaded, and that the Government should b convinced, that he had no intention of making any attack upon the Ministry, or to bring any accusation against them. Ine facts of the case lay -within a small compass. No less tban.47 officers of the Swiss Legion complained.that the asticles under which they had been enrolled had not been faithfully fulfilled. tAs far as he was Instructed the whole case depended upon the accuracy of the statement made by the petitioners, and he thought that the best plan which he could adopt would be to rea the prayer of the petition to their lordahips. The petition stated:- " That in the months of May, June, and July, 1855, your petitioners were enrolled, pursuant to the Foreign Enlistsment Act, in the abovenamed-legion, under certairL aicles of enlistment then printed -and p-ublished, at Berne, in Switzerland, dated Schelestadt, 1855, and bearing the signatures of Hans Sulzberger, Colonel; Charles Edward PFnk, Lieutenant-Colonel; John Baumgartner, Captain (staff). These gentlemen formed, under the presidency of Colonel Dickson, the eommission appointed by the English Govern ment, to enlist and organize the Legion; the articles alluded to were promulgated by Sir G. Gordon, the British Minister at Berne, .Colonel DickFon, the sa.id president of the Swriss Committee, and by the members of that bedy,and you-r petitioners were sworn in under those artiCles and under the precise termls and stipulations therein contained, That sAch articles contained, amongother things, the following stipulations :-Art. 2. That the officers and men should be elk. listed for the duration of the war, and for 12 months after the ratification of pea.ce. - Art.- 25. That upon disbandment the offlcers should receive 15 nonths' full pay, and theponcommissionod officers and men the full pay of two years, according to a certain tariff therein set forth, and sub ect to pertain reductions if retained in Eervioe after the ratultion of peace." The articles were issued under the direction of Sir 6. Gordon and Colonel Dickson, and were printed and altered by order of Colonel Dickson; but three months later Government issued a second code of articles, which were piinted without a date. and which also bore the signature of Colonel Dickson, and which stipulated - "That the officers and men-should be enlisted for the duration of the wvar, and for one year after the ratification of peace. Art 10. That on disbandment the officers should be allowed three.mouths' pay to carry themr home." The petitioners went on -to etate,- '-That upon disbandment they had claimed the fulfilment of the terms under which they enlisted, but the War-office refused to recognize the original articles, terming them unauthorized and. spurious. They offered the three months' pay. which your petitioners accepted under protest, and an arrangement was then made that, should your bon. House s3Dction the fulfilment of the articles of enlistment, the War-office would make no further objection to carrying out such stipulations. That a further offer of thzee months' pay has since been made to some of your petitioners, which m most instances has been rejected. - Thaz your petitioners were led to believe the accredited articles ismed by the mniltary agents of the British Government in Swltzerland, and promulgated by the British Ministerat Berne, and never doubted the honourable fulfilment of the articles of ati ula- tioe. That your petitioners, numbering 47 offioers of the British Swiss Legion, and forming the 1st and 2d battalions thereof, were legally enlisted and sworn in under the said original printed articles, issned at the Eoglish Ambassadors office at Berue no other articles being at that time in exist- ence, and that it was not until three months after their enlistment that the second articles were published." Now, those articles did no' in one sense differ from the original code of articles, but in another Sense they might Norq under either of those codes the petitioners conoeived that th4 wqrer entitled to 15 months' py after the ratifiea. tion of pMc..

Of course, in the settlement of these claims'many disputes occurred, both with officers and isnen; bt if his noble friend had been at, all aware of theinefinite Scaemwhihe hadbeen taken to adjust these matters and of the almet unanimity with whithey hAve beun adjvsch d, he. wotld -not in any wayhave questioned the disposition ofvthe Govegardent to deal fairly with all these persons. It was asserted by thes 47 officers that they were enisted-that was not a proper term-that they accepted service under Her Majesty upon certain condition. Colonel Dickson was the officer chlarged with canrying out the Foreein Enl,tmento Act, so far as concerned the raising of a Swiss Leon. Early in May he (Lord Panmure) sent that officer to Switzerland, giving him in this country a letter of service, ia dwhich wererecorded the terms uponi which hLe thonught It right that that regimen should be raised with regard to, both officezs and men. As this enlistment for the British army was not recognird. . by the law of Switzerland, Colonel Dickson. e3tabliShed rted a lace on the frontier a committee of three offioers of whih heWs himself. the president, and at this plce the formation of the legion was carried on. Afterwards Colonel Dickson went to,Berne, and there, in conjunction with the commit- thdrew up articles-o vserve rv and directed that they should be printed as they had been drawn up. This direction was not caried out. One member of the ommittee, i ajor Baumgartner, took upon himself to have printed what he catled an extract fromf these arteles, and to this heforg'ed the signatures of the other two mrambers of the coramittcee both of'gwhom now denied thai they gave him any autho. rity to append their names to this hpurious extract. in the cours of time Colonel Dickson sav this "extract." in print, tosmhe Immediately took -teps to deny itsa uthenticity and to explain to every officer who had,been engaged under it thAt these were miot the terms upon which lservice under 14=MXajesty. was to be -taken; and up to 'the disbandment of the legion no offictr coomplained that he was not satisfied upon this matter.

Iu their petition these 47 officers stated that tieysiOgned this receipt under protest, but he could find no trace of thoeexistenoeof such.% protest, and he believed that the whole matter bad been got up since. He was confirmed In this view by the fact that afezr the claim had beeni raised he received a letter from a solicitor and ex- mayor of Dover, intima-ting that the maRtter would beI brought before Parliament, but that- he was open to a compromise, if he (Lora.

The question whether Sir B. Hall should be allowed to make material alterations in public works which have received the sanction of Pahliament deserved the serions attention of their lordships. It was a, grave constitutional question, which they could not summarily dismiss, whother it should bg permitted to any Minister, however urgent might be the case, to spend money without the authority of Parliament. (Hear.) But he denied that there was any urgency in this case. How wavn this pond in St. James's Park situate r At one end of it was Buckingham Palace; Carlton-house-terrace was on tho north side, Birdcage-walk on the south, and the official residences of Her Majesty's inisters and-public offioes were on the east. He should like to know whether any oom. plaints had been made by any of the ocoupants of these buildngs. He thought that he could not do better than look at the Cow-! Guidc for the purposo of asoertainiag to whbat extent tho helth of officaal men and of members of their lordshipe' House had been injured by the miasma arlsing from the pond. He found that the Marquis of Claunricae, the Speaker of the House of Com. mons, two Prussian Ministers, Lord Londesborongh, Lord Overstone, and other gentlemen in a similar class of life, lived close to the pond. But he did not think that any of thetn were in a state of premature de¢ay. He had not beard that their friends were alamed by the state of their bealth, nor had he heard that the suppoeed mirsma arising out of the pond had at all depreciated the value of the property in the neighbourhood. Their lordships had not missed any of the members of Her Majesty's Governmnent from the Treasury bench opposite, nor did he believe that any of the imnisters were mising from the IHouLe of Commons. He believed that his noble friend the Controller of the Excheqner lived in Birdaege-walk, iL which there were barracks as healthy as any in the kirgdors. Therefore, he cnuld not understand what excuse the right bon barnr,et bad for violating one of the most sacred rnles which we had in this conutry, viz., that :'Lt aL shilling of the public money shoul be spent without tha'

" That the last election for the said county of the town of Galway, as far as regards the return of the said A. O'Flaherty, Esq., is a void election. " That tho said A. O'Flaherty, Esq., was, by his agents, guilty of bribery at the said last election. "- That it was not proved that the aets of bribery were committed with the knowledge or consent of the said A. O'Flaherty, Esq. "That the evidence given before the committee appears to establish the fact that systematic bribery of certain classes of the voters has prevailed at the last and at former elections for the county of the town of Galiway. " That cases of treating were proved at the said last election, hut that the consent of A\. O'Flaherty, Esq., or of his agents, was not proved thereto." THE ORDER OF THE BATH. Lord HOTHAX gave notice that in Committee of Supply upon Civil Contingencies he should call the attention of the noble lord at the head of the Government to the existing practice of exacting from officers admitted to the military division of the Order of the Bath an engagement that the insignia which they had received from Her Majesty should, st their death, be returned. THE SUEZ CANAL. Mr. D. GRIFFITH gave notice that on Friday, the 17th inst., on the motion that the House adjourn till Monday, he should call the attention of the House to the question, whether it would be conducive to the honour or interests of the country to manifest a jealous hostility to the project of the Isthmus of Suez canal, or whether it would not be more In awcordance with a disinterested impartiality to leave the subject to be dealt with by the physical and engineering diffimulties which surround its execution ? BARON ROTHSCHILD. Mlr. DILLWYN gave notice that he should move, on Friday next, a resolution to the effect that, whereas the Act of the 1st and 2d of Victoria was passed to allow persons to take oaths in the form which was most binding on their consciences, and whereas Baron Lionel de Rothschild had been returned as one of the representatives of the city of London, but was precluded from taking his seat and voting in consequence of the occurrence in the Oath of Abjuration of the words " on the true faith of a Christian," which he declared not to be binding on his conscience, the Clerk be instructed to omit these words in administering the Oath of Abjuration to persons who objected to take them as not being binding upon their consciences. (Hear, hear.) NEW WRIT. On the motion of Mr. HAYTER, a now writ was ordered for the city of Oxford in the room of Mr. Neate, whose election had been declared to be void. LA.MBETH ELECTION PETITION. Mr. INGHAM reported from the select committee appointed to try the merits of the petition against the return of Mr. Roupell, that a person named Tredre, who had been suammoned as a witness, had neglected to appear, and that the Sergeant-at-Arms, who had been directed to take him into custody, had not succeeded in apprehending him. He (hSr. Igham) now moved that the said J. Tredre had been guilty of contempt and breach of the privileges of the House, and that he be therefore taken into custody, and that the Speaker do issue his warrant acerdingly. The motion was agreed to. PROPERTY TAX UPON OFFICERS' QUARTERS. Sir D. L. EVANS asked the Under-Secretary for War whether the Secretarv of State for War had issued an order, dated the 30th of May, 1857, directing field officers of artillery, occupying field officers' quarters, to pay propertytax for those quarters? Sir J. RAMSDEN said, that an order to the effect stated had been issued,butthat it did not rest with the War Dapartment to decide anything upon this subject, inasmuch as it was prescribed by the Property-tax Act that on all houses belonging to Her Majesty, excepting the Royal palaces, whic were occupied by any officer in HIer Majesty's service, the property-tax should be paid by the ocoupier. THE INDIAN MUTINY. Mr. DISRAELL-There are such serious and, in some respects, such contradietory statements respecting the information contained in the last arrivals from Iadia, that I think it would be greatly for the convenience of the House if Her Majesty's Government would make some authentic statement of the intelligence which thay have received (hear hear). Beyond inviting the noble lord at the head of the Government to make that statemeat I would also ask him whether it is his intention to lay the papers with regard to the recent transactions in India upon the table of the House? Viscount PALMERSTON.-I cannot be surprised that tho accounts which have gone forth to the public of the intelligence recently received from India should lead to the question which the right hon. gentleman has addressea to me, but I am only able to state in reply that all the information which Her Majesty's Government have received is that which has been communicated to themn by telegraph messages, first from Cagliari and then from Marseilles, the messages conveying, although in somewhat different words, very nearly the same information. That information is as much known to the public as it is to Her Majesty's Government, and until the mails, which I believe may be expected to night or to-morrow, arrivefrom Marseilles, wo shall have nothing additional to communicate. The general outline of tho intelligence which wehave teceived is, in the firat place, that we have hnd the misfortane to lose the Commander-in-Chief; in the next place, that the disaffection which existed only ia a few regiments, according to the former accounts, appears to have spread to a greater extent among the Bengal army; and that a large number of the Bengal troops have, as stated in tho despatch, "disappeared." From that I presume that they have returned to their homes, but that the expresson useu, and no farther information is given. 0n the other hand, the troops which remained faithfal, rogether with some British forces, have had an encounter with the mutineers under the walls of Delhi. That encounter is stated to have resulted in the completa success of Her Majesty's troops-26 pieces of cannon were taken and the matineers were compeUed to seek refuge within the walls of the town. (Hear, hear.) The walls of Dalhi, as the Eouse is no doubt aware, are not regular fortifications, but aro merely upright walls, not possessing any of the defences which are usual in the case of fortifications. Further, it was expected when the inteligence left that the town would bo immediately assaulted. When the despatches arrive we shaU bo ready to lay before Parliament such portions of the cominuaici. tions as may be calculated to give to the House and to the public ful information as to the conrso of events. It may happcn that in thcse despatches, when they arrive, thera may be many circumstances, reasonings, and explanations which, from their very nature, it would not be desirable to make public; but wvhatever may be essential in order to afford fUll information as to what has occurred shall be presented; because, although not usual in matters of this sort, Her MIajesty's Government think that this is a case in which the ordinary custom should be departed from, and that exact information should be afforded both to PArlia. ment and to the country with respect to the actnal position of affairs in India. (Hear, hear.) Hr. DISRAELL-Myquestion with respect to the papers referred to despatches already reeeived by the Government. before the absolate oocurrence of these events, and which, perhaps, intimated their probable occurrence. I do not wish to limit my inquiry merely to the production of papers giving only a narrative of the events which have occurred during the last few weeks. I wish now to ask a questioa with respect to the city of Herat. Has the noble lord received any information recently from that city to the effect that the person nominated as the Governor of Herat has sworn allegiance to the Shah of Persia; that the Shah has aceepted that allegiance, and empowered him to coin money, such transactions being at variance with the treaty lately laid before Parliament? Lord PALUIERSTON.-The Governmeat wil endeavour to select from the correspondence connected with the events in India that which appears wel calculated to give information to Parliament. If farther information should be desired, it would be for those who think further information necessary to state their reasons for that belief. With respect to Herat the Government has received no information, tending to confirm the report to which the right hon. gentle. man has alluded. He is aware that by the treaty the Per. sians were to evacuate Herat, and we were to send an agent to that city to see that the evacuation was complete. 'hat agent, according to the last accounts, had not yet arrived there; but when he does arrive he will of course make his report on the state of things at Herat. Sir J. PAXINGTON.-I wish to put another question to the noble lord respecting the events in India. I have seen in a public newspaper that in the encounter before Delhi the mutineers mustered a force of 7,000 men, and that the British force amounted to only 1,800 men, consisting partly of Sepoys, and the statement went on to the effect that with this force of 1 800 men the attack on Delhi was to be carried into effect. I wish to know whether the telegraphic despatch received by the Government bears oat that statement ? Lord PALEERSTON.-The Govermment have no dethils of that encounter. The despatch simply states that the encounter had taken placc and that 26 gans had been taken. Perhaps I may as well state, though no question oa the point has beea put to me, the general outline of what the Government have thought it right to do. (Hear.) Immediate'ly onthereceipt of the information I have just described step; were taken by my noble friend atthe headof the WarDepsrt. ment, in conjunction with the Commander-in-Chief here, to select an officer to go out to India to take the place o! General Anson. The offler was made to Sir Colin Campbell, who accepted it. (Hear, hear.) Upon being asked who he would be able to start, the gaUant ofricer, with his ordinary promptitude, repliod "To-morrow" (hear, hear); and, accordingly, the offer having been made on Saturday, hewas off by the train yesterday evening. (Cheers.) A telegraphic despatch was sent to Marseilles to stop the steamer which is to take the mail, which left London on Saturd -y night, until the arrival of Sir Coliu Campbell, who, there fore, would not lose a single hour in reaching his destination (Cheers.) The house is aware that 14,000 men were un le r orders to go out to India before the arrival of the recent intelligence. Additional troops will now be sent ont, andtao House may rest assured that the Government wil take all the steps necessary to meet the emergency. (Cheers.) Lord Canning had in the meantime, on his own responsibillcy, done that which has been entirely approved of. He wroto to Lord Elgin, whom he thought his despatches would find at Ceylon, to request that he might divert for the Indian service a part of the force now on its way to China. I have no doubt that those despatches reached Lord Elgin; and the Government have made such arrangements with respect to Chia that, even if those troops should ba for a time diverted from their original destination, stiU there would be found on the China station ample means to carry on the operations there. (Hear, hear.) Lord GODERICH inquired whether the Governmmen were aware that Sir Patrick Grant had been appointed to th e command of the forces by the Indian Government ? Lord PALMERSTON.-We really know nothing bat what I have already stated. All our information comes by telegraph, and it often happens that private persons know, or pretend to know, more than the Government. (" Hear," and a laugh.) Sir E. COLEBROOKE inquired whether any additional reinforcements were going out to India from this country, or whether the reinforcements were to be confined to those originally destined for China ? Lord PALMfERSTON.-The reinforcements certainly ara not confined to the troops on their way to China. Fourteen thousand men were under orders for India, and would have embarked independent of the news just arrived; but the Government think it their duty to despatch as early as possible a considerable force in addition. (Hear, hear.) of course means must be taken by recruiting to supply the gap which will ba thereby made in the forces at home. (Haear, hear.) Sir E. COLEBROOKE said that after the announcement just made by the noble lord, perhaps!it wonld be convenient for the House to know that he should not no w- bring forward the motion of which he had given notice, to call the attention of the House to the inadequacy of the reinforcoments proposed to be sont to India. THE SAViNGS-BANKS BILL. In reply to Mr. TOLLEBLwCHE, The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER stated that he saw no prospect of proceeding with this Bill in the course of the night or week. He would state as soon as possible whether he saw any prospect of prGeeceding with the measure during the present session. THE DIVORCE BILL. In reply to Mr. HENLEY, Lord PALMERSTON said, it was the present wish and intention of the Government to bring on the Divorce Bill next Monday. CHATEEAM AND SLIGO ELECTIONS. TheSPEAKER acquaintedthe House that he had received notice that the petitioners complaining of an undue return in respect to these boroughs did not mean to prosecute the said complaint. VACCINATION. Sir J. PAKINGTON inquired whether it was the intention of the Government to bring in any Bill to amend the law with respect to vaccination ? Mr. COWPER said, the President of the Board of Hlealth had prepared a Bill on the subject, but delayed presenting it until the Bill now before the House respecting that board should pass. Sir J. PAKINGTON said that an important paper on the subject had lately been printed, and was lying in the Voteoffice. Had the Government any objection to distribute that paper to members? Mr. COWPER believed that the paper in question was one of great interest and of remarkable research; but according to the rules of the House ib was not circulated to members, but was only given to those who applied for it. THE PERSIAN AND CHINESE ESTIMATES. The CHaLYCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER gave notice that on Thursday next in Committee of Supply he would move the estimates for the expenses of the war with Persia and of the hostilites with China. Sir J. GR&HAU wished to know whether the Chaneollor of the Exchequer would be willing to lay on the table the estimate presented to the Government by tho East India Company in February last, containing their rough calonlation of the entire cost of the expedition up to December next; and also the correspondence on the subject? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCEIEQUEER said, the estimate to which the right hon. baronet refers was made at a time when the war was still unfinished and when the total cost of hostilities was uncertain. I shall on Thursday be in a condition to lay before the Houso the estimate of the East India Company with respect to the total expense of the war, which will ba more satisfactory than an citimate founded upon imperfect knowledge. Sir J. GRAHAM.-WiU the right hon. gontleman lay the original estimate on the table before tho discussion ? The CHANCELLOR of tbe EXCHEQ1UER.-Ishould object to lay that estimate on the table, but I wiU prodace the estimate prepared by the East India Company of what they anticipato wllU be the total expense of the war. Sir J. GRAHAX.-When will that be laid on the table ? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I wil lay it on the table to-morrow. (Hear, hear.) INDIAN OFFICERS. In reply to Mr. NOEL, Sir J. RAMSDEN said, the question of making an allowance in aid of their expenses to officers in the service of the East India Company who were on leave of absenco in this conntry and had been ordered to rejoin their regiments, was at present the subject of communication between the Board of Control and the War Department, but that, as soon as a decision was arrived at, no time should be lost in announc. ing it to Parliament. THE ORDNANCE SURVEY. In reply to a question from Sir D. NORRnYs1, Mr, WIL$QN said, ho h_d received from Colonel Jameg the following explanation of tho interpretation pat by hiuf napoa the vote of the House with reference to tho completion of the works of the Ordnance survey:- " I should complete the plans of the cultivatod districtsof those counties which are in progrees on the 25-inch scale, and draw the plans of those counties which are not in pro. gress on the 6-inch scale only. That is, I should complete on the 25-inch scale the plans of the cultivated districts of Nlorthual erland, Westmorland, Roxburgbshire, and Lanarkshire, and the other counties now actually in progress oC that scale, as we have completed the plans of Darham an*. Linlithgowshire; but should construct on the 6-inch ale. only the i,lans of Cemberland, and the other counties hr wihich the field survey has not been commenced on the 25iinch scale." Ho (llr. Wilson) could only add, that the Government weret most anxious to carry into effect the wishes of the Hlose om this subject. Sir D. NORREYS begged to ask what was the meaning of the phrase " in progreis," in Colonel James's communication? Would works which had only just been commenco be considered as " in progress ?" Mr. WILSON understood from Colonel James's note, that the expressien appUed to all those counties in which the survey had already been commenced upon the 25-inch ecale. TELE INDIAN DISTURBANCES. Admiral WA LOT said, as there was a largo reserve eF steamships at the command of the Admiralty he wished tq know whether it was intended to employ them in the conveyance of troops to India ? Sir a. WOOD replied that the Admiralty had reason tov believe that the troops could be conveyed to their destination more conveniently and rapidly by the employment. of hired transports. SUPPLY.-NATIONAEJ ART COLLECTIOM Mr. W. EWART askaed the Vice-President of the Board of Education whether, as it appeared from the returns laic' before the louase that in the case of some of our national collections of objects of art, science, and historical interest, as well as in the case of civil and religioas ediflioes and monuments (all maintained or assisted by the moneyvotes of Parliament), the public had the benefit of instruc. tion by means of descriptive labels afixed or appended tosuch objects, without incurring the cost of a catalogue, while itn the case of other such collections, edifices, and. monuments (similarly supported by public money) no such advantage was given to the public. measures would be takem for extending the system of labelling generally for the, benefit of the public ? MIr. COWPElK replied, that tbe Government had been most anxious to carry out the object to which the hon. gentleman referred in the case of all museums andcollections o4 objects of art, science, and natural products. At the BEitish Maseum, at the Kendngton Museam, and at other similar institutions, all the articles exhibited were described in r. short and condensed manner; and in the case of the Tumner collection, not only were the subjects of the various paintings described, but the date at which they were painted. was also given-an arrangement which afforded great assist. auce to stadents. THE ORDNANCE SURVEY. Lord ELCIHO, in rising to propose the motion of which he had given notice with reference to the ordnance survey, observed that circumstances of a private and very painfar nature connected with the intelligence just received from India would have induced him to forbear from bringing this subject under the attention of the House, were it not that this was the only opportunity of which he would be able to avail himself for elidting their opinion on a question which. he regarded as of great importance. Re hadbeen told that in again calling attention to the subject of the ordnancea survey he would only be wasting the time of the House, but he could not think he was open to such a charge whenhe asked hon. gentlemen to consider whether something like, 2,000,00D1. of the public money was expended profitably or unprofitably. He did not propose to reopen the question of the 25-inch scale, bat he bowed to the decision at which the House of Commons had arrived on that subject. Hebelieved, however, that that decision was in a great measure attributable to the general misconception which existed on the sabject, and to the idea that this was exclusively a Scotcb question, or, as it had been termed, "a Scotch job." With regard to its being " a Scotch job," ha begged to say that whatever steps might have been taken in Scotland since the survey upon the 25-inch scale had been in progress a similar course had been adopted in Englanda The fact was that the survey had proceeded in the two, countries ptassuc. What was the position of the survey when the House arrived at its decision? In the northern. ortion of England, and throughout Scotland, the Ordnance& had made surveys, and had published maps of the cultivated rural districts upon the scale of 25 inches to the mile- and they were also publishing a 6-inch map, and & 1-inch map of the whole country. The large towns, the, population of which exceeded 4,000, were surveyed upon a 10-feet scale. When the scale for the survey of the rural districts was raised from 6 inches to 25 inches, th3 scale for the survey of towns was raised fromn 5 feet to 10 feet, and it might have been though' that when the country survey was reduced from 2O inchesto 6 inches, the town survey would also have been reduced from 10 feet to 5 feet. He waq, however, quite willing that. towns should enjoy the advantage of a realy good practical survey, which would be afforded by a 10-inch scale. He found from the letters of the Secretary at War that the survey was in progress on the 25-inch scale in threa counties in the north of England-Northumbsrland, Westmorland, and Darham-and in nine coanties in' Scotland, including Renfrew, Ayr, Damfries, and Peebles; and in those counties of Scotland would be found the larg1 proportion of the cultivated districts of that country, The total estimate for the survey of Scotland, condacted in the way he had described, after making a deduction inb respect of the work already done, amounted to 624,0001. ; and as regarded Scotland the only saving effected by theChange would be about three farthings an acre, or 50,0001. in the aggregate. Again, in the counties which had beenbegun in the north of England the only saving would bo 5,tO01. The total saving, therefore, would amount to 55,0001. But there were considerations why that sum should be reduced by at least 25,0001., so that the actual saving would be something like 30,0001., or ratber under that sum. (Hear, hear.) Whatever the House had done vith respec. to the north of England and Scotland they must be prepared to do in the south of England. What would be tho saving effected on the survey of the whole of Great Britain? Why, somewhere about 230,0001., which appeared to him a very trifling one. Bat they had further to consider wbether, in effecting that saving, they were adopting a realy useful scale. He might remind the House that the 6-inch Ecale originated in Ireland in 1824, on the motion for a committee to report on that question made by Mr. SpriDg Rice, now Lord Monteagle. That committee, after referring to the various divisions and subdivisions of land in Ireland, such as townlands, ploughlands,. colps, gneeves, cartrons, tates, bullibos, bullibellos, horse. men, beds, cows' feet, and cows' toes (a laugh), came to the conClusion that the survey of that country should bh conducted on such a scale as to admit of an accarate delineation on the map of the town boundaries, for the purpose of a general valuation for local purposes, and that that scale should be 6 inches to the English mile. They stated that " a survey by towalands appeared to bethe rational medium between a baronial or parochial and field survey, and that the best scale for effecting the intended survey would ba that of 6 inches to the English cille," adding that "a. survey of 6 inches to the mile might be applied to various purposes of private utility." It was, there. fore, for special purposes in Ireland that that scale was. adopted, namely, for a property purpose, and for aidng the Irishi makig local assessments. Now, they had to consider whether such a scale as that was or was not a proper scale for a property survey In England and Scotland. When he used the word " property" survey, he did notmean a surveyof a gentleman's propertyfor privatepurposes, but a survey for registration and other pubbo purposes-one, in fact, which should fulfil al those national objects for which such a survey should be ndertaken. That brought him to the committee of IS51, appointed toconsider the survey of Scotland. He had heard complaints made-chiefly by Irish members-as to the constitution of that committee, that the Scotch had shown very little delicacy in the matter, in that the majority of members who served upon it were Scotchmen. Now, he found that the Irish members had had three committees appointed in connexion with the ques!ion of an Ordnance survey. Tho first was in 1824, which consisted of 21 members, Lord Monteagle being chairman, of whom one was a Sc,tchman, five were Englishmen-one of the latter being the Irish Secretary-and 15 were Irish. In 1SI1 there was another committee appointed to inquire into and report unon the then state of the ordnance survey in Ireland an& on the works wliich would be required for its completion. That committee, of whom Sir D. Norreys was cihairsan, consisted of 15 m ambers, of wvhom one was a Scotchmtn, two. were Englishmnen-one being the Irish Secretary and. the other the Clerk of the ordnance-and 12 were Irishmen. Mr. Barry Baldwin was subsequently added to the comn mittee, a name which ho (Lord Eleho) suspected was that. of au Irish gentleman (a laugh), tbough he sat for au English borough. Again, in 1653. a committee was appointed to consider and report upon the details of the reduced map of Ireland then in course of publication ; and thati committee consisted of 13 members, of whom, while there was not a single Scotehman, one was an Englishman and 12! were Irish (' ear, hear," and a laugh) SirD. Norros being again chairman. Ho (Lord Elho) thereoref trusted, after that, that the House would hear no mo.-e from any hon. member from across St. George's Channel as to theindelicacy of the Scotch in tho constitu.tion of any committee of that House. He would revert to the comamittee, of 1851, which was appoillted chiefly on account of the, delay wvhich had occurred in the survey of Scotland. Wha' had that conuimittee done ? They examined several persons both for and against the 6 inch scale, and the conclusions they came to were :- That the 6-inch scale bo abandoned. It is evident, that if the 6-inch scale were abandoned a very Large savin would ho effected, and the tieo necessary for the comnpletion of the mnap (-inch) greatly shortened. Your committee, therefore, rcommend the abandonment of the 6-incu scale as being, generally speaksing, iapplicable to ScotW hat appied to Scotland applied equally to England. Tha committee added, that undoubtedly the plans would be of some val,me to proprietors in the valuation of their estates. The Scotch members decided, notwithstanding, against the 6-inch scale, upon the ground that tboy did not think the advantages to the public wtsuld be proportionate to the cost to the country. All the objections which could be taken to the 25-inch scale, on account of size, applied equally to the 6-inch scale. It appeared in evidence before the committee that a map of Sotland on the 6-inch scale would be 216 feet long by 120 feet broad. The hon. gentleman the member for Mallow said he considered a large map a great evil and that the thing was to getas small a map as possible. In the cosnmittee of 1846, when the hon. baronet wasvers sanxioks to get a 1-inch map, ho denied as far as possible the utility of a 6 inch map. When Mr. Griffith wasunder examination Sir B. Perguson asked, " Is it likely there would he any room large enough to hold tho map of a verylarge countiry upon the 6-inch scale." The answer was,. 'It would require a very large room indeed. In the counuy of Cork I do not suppose they have any room large. tnousb to hold the map of theounty," Th, hoxi, pMU

LO1WODQ, TUESDAY, JULY14 1857. In the House of Lords last night Lord ELLmNIOROumr again called the attention of the House to the alarming condition of our empire inl India, and complained of the small amount of official information that had been afforded on a nubject of such paramount importance. He, indeed, congratulated the Government on the judicious appointment they had made in selecting Sir Comw mJABn to succeed the late General Asos as Commander-in-Choief in India. Th order, how;ever, to give full effect to the abilities of Sir COHIN CAarrir two things were necessary l-st, that he should be completely emancip3ated from the thraldoxa of politicals; and, secondly, that he should carry with hiin the whole weight and authority of the GovoR-GiIN=AL,. Ile thought also the temporary appointment of Sir 'PATRICK GRANT a very good one. He was not dis.ppointed at not hearing of the capture of Delhi by the present mall, for he thought it could bardly bayve fallen within the time that had elapsed since thelast advices. The main thing, however, for conid4eration was so to take meares as to have a reaUy efficient force in the field by the lst of November, before which time our reinforcements could hardly reach India. The Te4st force which we ought to have was eight .or fen regiments of infantry, six regiments of cavalry, andl 2- atteriesof artillery, for which last horses ought to be sent from Europe, and gun carriages ordered in India. With this force, which he would make up by diverting the regiments now destined for China, the existing rebellion might be stamped L. , 6 b ir LorasU3p3 mIgan rely uponL wLnai -it could only be extinguished by prompt and vigorous means, and that any temporizingmeasures would enly entail on Ul a succession of bloody and doubtful campaigns, and perhaps destroy our Indiani empire altogether. He concluded by asking for further official information connected with the Indian mutinies. Lord GsuNvTTarE replied that the Government -vere only at present in possession of the telegraphic Iness2ge which had been already made public. Further information might be expected that evening or in the course of the next day, the substance of which would, of course, be published. With regard to the whole question he could assure Lord EaaEwrBoBouGu that the (doverhment were not at aU inclined to treat the matter lightly, and though he could not agree with him when hetalkedof calamity and disgrace, and though he declined to follow him into the realms of prophecy, Lord EraiuonouoHl might rest asured that the Government were prepare&toact with tLe greatet vigour in this emergency. Lord Mmvim., in an impressive speech, called the attention of the House to the bad discipline ,which had existed for years past in the Bengal arty 3s distinguished from those of the other Preidez~cies, and supported his assertion by examples erhved from his Indian experiences. A few remarks from Lord ALBEmAIRLE concluded the discussion. A debate then arose, in which Lord M&aMEssluY advocated the claims of certain officers of ithe late Swiss Legion, with whom, as he alleged, the War Department had broken faith. Lord PA.Nun;E, however, declared that the agreemnent upon which the claim of these officers was founded was forged by a member of the committee of officers and inserted into the articles without the consent of the remaining members of the committee. He utterly denied that the Government had broken faith with the Swiss Legion, towards which, on the :contrary, he asserted great liberality had been shown. Lord MALurssuly returned to the charge, which Lord PAsRuiu again repelled. The debate then degenerated into a general diacussion as to the policy of foreign. enlistments at all. At this stage Lords HAUDWICKE and CrINCARTY took it up. It then lainguished and dropped. After a discussion as to the grant of money for the improvements in St. James's Park, in which Lords MALLSBuRY, GRANiVLE, and MONTEAGLE stok part The Obscene Publications Prevention Bill was rerd a third time and passed, after considerable discussion, in which Lords IrBELL, SHATESURY, IYNDHUXST, and WXNsLEzYDAIE took part. Lord CAsmnPBE brought up the report of the Select Committee on the Reports of Public Meetings, which he explained to the House at some length. Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Commons, in reply to an inquiry by Mr. DisRrA, Lord PASTxsON said, the only information HER MAJESTY'S Government had received from India was that communicated by the telegraphic messages, and which was as weU known to the public as to the Government-namely, the death of the Commanderin-Chief in India; the disaffection of a few additional regiments of the native army; that a large numberof the BengalSepoys had disappeared, having returned to their homes; that, on the other hand, in an encounter with the mutineers under the walls of Delhi they had lost 26 pieces of cannon, and been forced to take refuge within the walls of the city, which, it was expected, would immediately be assaulted. When the despatches arrived, he added, the Government would be ready to lay before Parliament and the public whatever papers were essential to full informiation with respect to the course of events. Dlr. DisnAymy inquired further, whether information had been received from Herat that the person nominated governor of that city had sworn allegiance to the SHA of Persia, that the SHAHl }ad accepted his allegiance, and authorized him to coin money,-a proceeding at variance with his sngagements under the treaty? Lord PALZIESToN replied, that HER MIlAESTY's Government had received no information fending 4o confirm this report. In answer to Sir J. PAKINOTON, the noble Lord stated that Lord PAxmuRE had taken immediato steps to select a Commander-in-Chief in India; that an offer of the post had been made to Sir COLIN CAMPBELL, who had acoepted it; that, when asked how soon he would be able to start, Sir CoLD replied " To-morrow ," and accordingly, the offer having been made and accepted on Saturday, he had set off on Sunday evening, a telegraphic despatch having been sent to Marseilles to stop the steamer till his arrival. Lord PAlMsSTON proceeded to state that, in addition to the 14,000 troops under orders for India, and which had partly embarked, more were to be sent; that Lord CANnWG had written t6 Lord ELa w to divert to the Indian service some part of the force destined for China; and that Sich arrangements would be made, if any of these troops were actually diverted from their original destination, that there would be amplc means to carry on operations in China. On the order for going into a Committee of !supplyy SUord ELCnO moved a resolution, " That in the present position of the Ordnance survey of Great Britain, the survey on the six inch scale ought not to be proceeded with without further inquiry, and that an address should be presented to Enr MAJESTY praying HR MAJESTY to appoint a Royal commission to inquire into the whole subject of the national survey, and report upon the scale or seases on which it should be made and published." He entreated the House not to take a hasty and irrevocable step in this matter, and to refer the question to a competent tribunal,-a Royal Commission, fairly constituted. Lord PALikEnsToN recommended the House not to be tempted into a renewal of the discussion upon this subject, after their late decision, which the Government had adopted. He could not, he said, agree to the resolution; but if Lord ELcano would consent to strike out the first part of it, and simply move an address to the CRowN, he would not object. The motion was negatived, after a ahort disCussion. The House then went into Committee of Supply upon the remaining Civil Service Estimates, and after a long dicuesion several Bils were forwarded a stage, and, On the motion of Mr. CowAN, the House adjourned at five minutes to 1 o'clock.
We have already said, and we repeat, that the last Indian news neither brings fresh reasons for alarm nor affords any pretence for security. Nevertheless there is much gravity in the intelligence that the CoSrmANDER-I-CHEF has succumbed to the fatiguez of a march which at this season of the year was said to be all but impossible; that the Army which was to have arrived before Delhi about the 26th of May was only occupying the surround, ing heights, after a serious engagement, on the 8th of June; that there were still daily defections of ivhole regiments, besides incessaut desertion, all over the Bengal Presidency; that even at Lucknow, under the able hand of Sir HEzRY LAwRENE, the cry was " To Delhi " that the telegraphic communication between Delhi, Agra, and Calcutta had been cut off; and that the losses by mutiny and all causes were computed at 28,000. With such intelligence known to have been received, with more suspected, and with the announcement that the new ComANDmi-IN-CHnr selected by the GovEENoR-GEnE was to be superseded by another already on his way, it certainly was to be expected that in one or both of the Houses some explanation would have been made as to the measures deterniined on. A Cabinet attended by the Duke of CA=RnsDcE and the Chairman of the East India Company must have produced some very definite results, and it would have been better than the most favourable intelligence to know that we were taking a course moraUy certain to secure our Indian Empire. Yet, strange to say, the conversation in the Lords last night was left chiefly in the hands of Lord ELrzBorouGo and Lord MELvnmE, Lord GnAwvmn, like Lord PALMxESTON in the other House, almost confining him.A-lf to some general dissuasives against unnecessary alarm. This reserve is all the less satisfactory when one is made painfully aware by the statements of Lord Eram-BonouGH and Lord MELvmEr that there has been a great deal too much reserve already on Indian affair. The people who have buried their heads in the sand, and then said there was no danger, are not European observers, but Indian actors. Officers fresh from Indian service and Indian command now tell us that the whole Bengal Army has long been in a state of chronic revolt; that the high caste gentlemen who compose it are too important personages to do work and to obey, except when it pleases them; that the Bengal Presidency has been denuded of European troops to a dangerous extent, and that for its present safety there is required as large a force of European infantry, cavalry, and even artillery, as we can possibly collect there from England, from the other Presidencies, and even from China. When men of such means of arriving at a just opinion of the crisis tell us all this, we can only wonder that they have not told us more before, and that Government declines, on the ground of a politic reserve, to tell us what it is doing. The silence of those who might have said much to reassure the public gives stronger relief to the volunteer counsels of the eloquent ex-GovernorGeneral and another peer, hitherto more remarkable for his abstinence from debate. In these speeches we have a very forcible outline of the evils to be cured and the measures to be adopted, and should Mnisters neglect the warning it will live to convict them. Lord ELLENBOROUGH has not overrated the additional force which may be found necessary for the suppression of the revolt; for the same Indian authorities who at the first outbreak estimated their wants at 10,000 Europeans now ask for twice that number. As he shows, we have to provide, not only for the actual safety, but also for the sense of perfect security at Calcutta, the headquarters of Government, of commerce, and finances. We have to provide a force sufficient to operate against the insurgents wherever they may be, and whatever strength they may muster. Besides these two first necessities there must be a strong European reserve at the two bases. of operations,-at Allahabad, and on the side of the Punjab, the latter of which requires all its present European forces for its own defence. Further, there are the communications to be kept up, or rather restored; and, no doubt, many stations in the North-Western provinces are now in extreme danger, and call for succour. Such, as Lord ELLENBOROUGH states, are the requirements to be met, and that immediately. Native India must learn from our measures on this occasionthat,though our army there be small, and we ourselves distant, yet by energy and unbounded resources, by our naval and mechanical superiority, we can present ourselves anywhere on the whole peninsula in number equal to the occasion in the course of half a-year, and that the best planned and most successful rebellion will not be allowed that period to consolidate itself, to collect materials, and organize defence. Lord ELxnBoRoucan gives us to the 1st of November for the arrival of adequate reinforcements at Calcutta, and supposes them at the scene of action by the beginning of the new year. Considering the reverses that may be sustained, and the horrors that may be committed between this and next New Year's Day, we do not wonder that some members ia the other House look with a wistful eye at the vast fleet of war steamers now idling in our harbours. Where are those wondrous processions that marched through the waters at Spithead before the late war, and after its conclusion? Were those holyday creations? Were they the painted giants carried about in old pageantries ? If those vast hiulks are so swift, so manageable, and so capacious, could not some of them be employed to convey troops to India somewhat faster, if only by two or three weeks, than mercantile transports? Arrived there, instead of being sent back immediately, as having discharged their errand, they might be useful in defending Calcutta, or contributing to that sense of 3e'curity which is no small element of actual power. If these costly fabrics, still increasing and multiplying, are of any use, if they can take troops to India, as well as they brought them from the Crimea, surely the repugnance of naval officers to do trasport duty is not to be set against the possession of a great empire and the due discharge of an immense national responsibility. What are our ships, officers, and men good for, if not for the salvation of India? We shall not be supposed to accept without discrimination all the suggestions offered by Lord ELsaoRoouGH 'with his usual generosity of sentiment and fertility of ideas. Considering the expediency of keeping in our hands the principal arm of the service, and the predilection for artillery always shown by the natives, most people will think this a time for adding some batteries of that force to HER MAJSrTy'S army in the East. Happily we are in a condition to send them. It Is another question whether we can send several thousand horses to India, or whether it be at all necessary to do so. Lord ErjnsnonouGa's observations on the two Commanders-in-Chief will be read with more interest and agreement. No doubt just now, when so large an addition is made to EfR MAaEsTy's regiments in India, or rather when a Royal Army of no inconsiderable amount is sent out for a particular crisis, it would seem a strong measure to give the command in chief to a " General of Sepoys." Yet the public opinion, not only of India, but of this country, points to Sir PATFrcK GnA-.ur as just the man for the occasion, and possessed of the very experience, temper, and other qualities for dealing with the native soldiers. It eertainly seems much to be regretted that any mere etiquette or other formality should make it necessary to supersede him, perhaps at the moment of success, or while Carrying out plans of which he alone is fully master. Sir Cowl CxsxrBm, though a brave and good soldier, and without a superior in command of a brigade, has never yet had even the opportunities of showing those powers of combination necessary for the suppression of a wide-spread mutiny,-perhaps for the reconquest of an immense empire. Here, then,- we want qualities which we seem to be throwing away. Lord EzLENBOROuGH therefore advises, with no small weight of authority, that Sir PATRIcx GBAr be made an extraordinary member of the Council, and so qualified to offer the GovERwon-GENEiEn that advice on military affairs which just now no other member of the Council is so competent to give. It is to be hoped, indeed, that ere the arrival of Sir CouL the mutiny will have been stifled, crushed, and stamped out in the city of Delhi, which the mutineers themselves have chosen for the decision of their cause. But even then there is much to be done. The Bengal Native Army has to be reconstructed with more regard to the political relations of the European and the Hindoo, and Sir PATIaCK GRANT is a man peculiarly fitted to meet the difficulties of this delicate task.
It is said that the very last subject a man likes to think of is his own will and testament. The event for which the document provides, the necessity for coming to a resolution on critical points, the solemn visit of the lawyer, and even the minor apparatus of the ceremony-the engrossed sheet, the ttested signature, the black was, and the sealed envelope, to be opened only after the, decease of the prncipal party' present-are all ineidents of auimpressive and somewhat deterrent character. It is found, indeed, occasionally that their repulsive force is sufficient to make people postpone the act indefinitely; and yet it is to this topic, unwelcome as it is, that we mnust challenge the reader's attention this morning. The question, after all, possesses in true interest what it may lack in attraction, nor is it often that a Parliamentary discussion is fraught with consequences of more direct and immediate concern to the country than that which, beginning on Monday and continued on Friday of last week, will be resumed on Friday next, on the new Probate and Administration Bill. When a man dies and leaves a will behind him the instrument requires to be "proved," a ceremony which is performed by the grant of "probate" from a Court constituted for that purpose, after which the directions of the deceasedcan be duly carried into execution. The point in dispute last week concerned the extent of jurisdiction which, in this respect, should be left to local or district Courts, as distinguished from the new Probate Court to be instituted in London. The ATTORNEYGENERAL'S Bill, as originally framed, enacted that wherever the amount of the property to be conveyed bywillexceededl,5001. probate should be obtainable not in the district courts, but in the metropolitan court only. Against this limitation a stand was very naturally made. Why should a will conveying furniture, farming stock, or machinery valued at 2,0001. be provable only after considerable expense and trouble, while the will of another man in the same street and the same kind of business worth 5001. less could be executed at half the cost? The object of the proposed reform was to obtain cheap testamentary law in all cases, not in certain cases only, and the argument acquired strength from the fact that any points which might arise for the opinion of the Court respecting the validity of the will would be entirely independent of the amount of pro;?erty at stake. - The question, as MIr. MAINS put it, for a Court of Probate was one of "will or no will"-the instrument was to be pronounced valid or invalid, and the decision would be irrespective of the money value of the bequests. e The 'explanations given by the ATTOnNEYGENEnL in reply to these very natural arguments were extremely perspicuous in their form, but somewhat singular in character. Of course, it was obvious to remark, that a Court constituted like the Metropolitan Court of Pr6bate might bring a greater amount of vigilance and discernment to bear upon a document laid before it than a district Court composed, according to the ATToRNEY-GENEA's picture of such an establishment, of a registrar and a single clerk at 25s. or 30s. a-week. It was less likely, therefore, that an error should occur under the former jurisdiction than under the latter. All this was plain enough, but, as Sir J. TBoL Lorn and Mr. RoEuuoC correctly observed, integrity and ability were essential requisites in all testamentary Courts alike, and an estate of 1,5001. value deserved just the same protection as one of 15,0001. Either the new Courts were well qualified for their duties, or they were not; if they were, they could judge of one will as well as another; if they were not they were unfitted to judge of any. The cogency of this reasoning was evident, and the remarkable point of the ArToulNEy-GFNmA2's reply is, that he frankly accepted the conclusion. He admitted without disguise that the district Courts would not only be, relatively, less trustworthy than the metropolitan Court, but that there would be a positive insufliciency in - their qualifications if rigorously estimated, and that the evil, though tolerated for the saLe of the good accomplished, was undoubtedly understood. For the sake of bringing the agency of the Iaw to e`rey man's door, Government, he said, had " departed from the "t rueprinciple of requiring that all wills should "be subjected to that perfect examination which "could only be given in the principal registry in "London." The consequence, therefore, of the argument was this-that district Registries or Courts of Probate would be such convenient offices that it was desirable to establiah them, but that the security attending their proceedings would be so comparatively insufficient as to suggest, in a prudential view, a limitation of the amounts over which they might have cognizance. Fortunately for the public satisfaction, it does not appear that this rather unwelcome conclusion is very soundly based; in fact, the House received the expression of Sir R. B.mTHr'S misgivings not with sympathy, but with smiles. Mr. WFSTREAD produced some statistics, which we quote not cnly as bearing very forcibly on the question at issue, but as suggesting some pleasant conclusions as to the wealth of the country. In order to show that a limitation to 1,6001., or tvice that sum, was altogether inadmissible,he observed that in the five years ending with 1855 no fewer than 4,555 wills with a personalty in each case above 1,5001. had been proved-in the diocess of Chester and the Prerogative Court of York, exclusive of the Consistory Court of Durham, and that of these wills two exceeded 300,0001., four 200,0001., six 160,0001., four 140,0001., ten 120,0001., six 100,0001., nineteen 80,0001., twenty-eight 60,0001., fifteen 50,0001., thirty 45,000Z., two hundred 25,0001., and four hundred and fifty-eight 12,0001. Of those exceeding the respectable sum of 10,0001. there were actually 2,066. Now, where, he proceeded to ask, was the evidence of any fraud, even under the present system, with all its numerous Courts ? Objections as to the constitution and costliness of these Courts there might be, but as to the risk of maladmiistration' a registrar of 28 years' experience had deposed that of 8,400 wils which had passed through his hands " not one had been repudiated or revoked, "and only two contentious cases had arisen out "of the whole." Be it observed, too, that the business proposed to be intrusted to these district Courts is only " common form" business-i. e.> business involving no contest, and consequently carrying less risk of error. Very reasonably, therefore, did the House decide against the pro, posed principle of limitation. But there was another point behind, and one which had evidently exercised some influence uponw the originalform of the measure. The danger of error was held to affect not only legatees, but others. Supposing a man, through the presumptive ineffi. ciency of a district Court, were to obtain probate of sn invalid will, conveying money in the funds or in shares, he might act upon it forthwith, dispose of this very convertible property before the mischief could be detected, and thus introduce embarrassraent into the management and affairs of great commercial companies. In point of fact, bur huge Joint-stock concerns, together with our immense public stocks, represent a species of property so very "movable" in its nature as to require special attention in any piece of legislation. In the case of ordinary property an error in the grant of probate might be remedied; in the case of shares or funded property it would be virtually irretrievable, and this view of the matter, in which Mr. ROLT coincided, suggested the exception of this particular property from the operation of the clause. As the AxT0sNEY-GmNzRAL described the case, " it would be difficult for a man to run ' away with a rick of corn or a flock of sheep, but " very easy for him to run away with 1,0001. " Consols." This point, therefore, stands over for disoussion still; but, although it is not certain that for such bequests probate must not be obtained in Tondon, the debate has clearly settled th the jurisdiction of district Courts shouldnot be affected by the mere amount of the property at issue. TM fbis decision we entirely agree, nor do we, while looking with confidence to the economy and convenience likely to result from the new scheme, anticipate any practical drawbacks in the way of inefficiency or error.
The question of the Civil Service Superannuation stands for consideration this day. Nothing could appear more simple to a man of ordinary understanding than the solation of this difficulty- nothing more extraordinary than the complications i by which it has been surrounded. There are many thousands of persons in the Civil employment of the CROwN at certain fixed rates of salary. How are they to be provided for in the contingencies of sickness, old age, or other incapacity, not being misconduct or malversation in office? One of two systems might be adopted. Salaries might be fixed at such a rate that we should be justified in considering ourselves free from all responsibility to these gentlemen beyond that of maintaining them in their offices as long as they are able to discharge the duties -which they have undertaken, but not a moment longer. The second plan would be, to make the contract for service at a lower rate of salary, with the understanding that pensions would be granted on the occurrence of contingencies named, at rates calculated on the duration of service, &c. On either of these systems the Civil (mploy&s would have no reasonable ground of complaint. If the first should be preferred, there is no ;hardship in leaving gentlemen who are placed and maintained in the enjoyment of such a salary as is a sufficient compensation for the services they perform under the necessity of providing against a rainy day. If they are married and have families they must have recourse, like the rest of us, to the usual machinery of life insurance. If the salaries are calculated at a sufficiently remunerative rate, this plan, upon theoretical grounds, is entirely unexceptionable. We do not, however, say that it is one absolutely to be preferred, and for the following reasons :_-There would be a strong temptation held out-to persons who are really unable to discharge their duties with energy and vigour to remain in the public service, because the choice held out to them is between a good salary and zero. Nor could we, on the ordinary principles of human action, look to the heads of departments to stand between the public and their infirm servants. Poor BROWN has had a bad fit of sicklness, but a run to the sea-side will put him to rights again; we must not be over hasty to strike, and bring ruin upon the tidy little establishment in the Oval at Kennington. What would become of the chintz furniture neatly eased in brown holland, and of the green gauze round the drawing-room ' looking-glass," to protect the splendour of the golden frame from the pollutions of the skittish flies-nay, of the " looking-glass" itself ;-and of the sacred portrait of Mrs. B., in which that lady is represented as perpetually engaged in the perusal of a back number of the Keepsalxe; and of the {tern photographs of the thirteen little BowNs ? Surely the simoom of official displeasure will not be too ready to sand over that little oasis. RoBINsoN, again, has been fifty-three years in harness ; he hasI now reached the length of man's allotted tether ;- grievous pity wereit that the veteran of blottingpaper and office seals should be cast out upon the world for his few remaining years of life. He came to his desk before steel pens were thought of, and in his last moments he shall not be debarred from fumbling with red tape. The natural and kindly feelings of humanity forbid any very rigorous enforcement of the first system named. Again, it would "be a discredit to the country that public servants 'shbuld froni time to 'im'e be thrown ~absolutefy penniless upon the world, to exhibit thel spectacle of their deatitution, although it might be .perfectly true that such destitution was the consequence of their own improvidence and unthrift. Still, with these and other drawbacks, which must readily, occur to any one who brings his attention to bear upon the point under considerationj it is unde, niablethatthesystem of" Pay theclerklawell, dis" charge them when unfit for work, and leave " them to look out for themseIves," would be a perfectly just one, and far preferable to the present hybrid arrangement, which is not a system at all, and only operates to work injustice and breed dia. content. Next, wo have to consider the other plan, which consists in the allocation of a certain sum for the payment of our public servants, part of the agoregate sum, the bulk ef it, being considered as the fund out of which'salaries would be payable,-the snaller part a fund for the creation of pensions. What is the objection to this ? In principle there can be none, as it would be difficult to conceive anything more equitable as between both partiesthe public and the clerk,-more advantageous to the public, and more considerate to the clerk,-than that, on the one hand, he should be paid for his services as long as he is in a condition to perform them, and receive the means of support-of bare support-when no longer able to perform his duties; and, on the.other hand, that he should not be tempted, we may say compelled, by overpowering necessity to cling to his poet when, through sickness, infirmity, or old age, he is useless, and a mere burden to his employers and associates. We do not say one word as to the rates at which salaries should be fixed, although there is a strong opinion abroad that our Civil Servants are not overpaid, even if they were permitted absolutely to retain their salaries at the present amounts. We have before us a petition from the City, which was presented the other day by Sir JA&ss Dun to the House of Commons, and which bears the signatures of the LonD MAYOR Baron ROTsc=D n and 229 of the most influential Aldermen, Common Councilmen, Bankers, Merchants, and Shipowners of London. It is upon the subject of this Civil Service Superannuation grievance, and surely upon such a matter these gentlemen are well entitled to be heard. Each of them in the course of- his own business Is under the necessity of employing largely the same kind of labour which is required for the service of the State; each of them 'knows what he pays in the shape of salary for such service; each of them knows what he ought to pay. Now, what these great merchants say is this:- " Your petitioners, having regard to the evidence before a Select Committee of your Hon. House in 1856 Dn the Civil Service Superannuation question, are of opinion ihat the Civil Servants of the Crown, asa body, are not so well paid for their services as employga of the same grade in commercial and other walks of life :;they have not the same opportunities for advancement in society as persons of similar standing inindependent situations; that none-of the prizes of meremutflaJife s are open to them; that their limited power of mitdngprovlsion for their support when worn out in the public service hI gretly impaired by the heavy tax imposed on their salaries for providing superanntuation pensions; and that the. tax otherwis entails on those who have to pay it mnuch domestic distress." This. surely is a very strong expression of opinion, and from very competent persons. The petitioners conclude by expressing their concurrence in the resolutions at which the Select Committee arrived in 1856-namely, first, that it is desirable to abolish altogether the system by which a portion of the pittance of the Civil Servants is deducted on account of superannuation allowances; and, secondly, " that the practice of providing super" annuation pensions for the members of the per"manent Civil Service is based on sound prin"ciples of policy." We most heartily concur with the recommendations of the Select Committee and with the opinions expressed by the City petitioners, so far as the grant of -moderate pensions to old, infirm, and well-deserving Civil Servants of the CROWN is concerned. At the same time, it seems desirable that the general body of pmyls should not be exonerated from the duty of making some provision out of their annual salaries for themselves in case of sickness or unforeseen accident, or for their wives and families in case of death. Never was there a question so idly confused as this one has been. It seems almost as though ingenuity had been taxed to the utmost for the purpose of entangling that which was plain, that ingenuity might be again taxed to disentangle the entanglement. The great point is to establish a plain and equitable system for the future. Let bygones be bygones. A very large balance, of which one division at least of the clerks has been unjustly shorn, remains, we believe, in the hands of the Government. Surely any respectable actuary, or couple of actuaries, could point out an equitable method of dealing with this sum, such as would not work injustice to those who have paid it, and prove of benefit to themselves and their successors. The great point, however, is that from a given day an equitable and reasonable system should come into operation which should put a stop to all future injustice. The present -CHNCEaLOR of the EXCHEQUER has not dealt quite ingenuously in the matter, for he is struggling for further delay, on the ground that the Committee of 1856 desired the opinion of two eminent actuaries on the point of whether or no the Civil Servants paid more than they received. This point is not the true one, however it ibay be decided; but, even if it were so, nine actuaries, among whom are the leading persons in the profession, have already concurred in the bpinion that " the average value "of the pensions actually granted is considerably "less than the pensions that should be given for "the contributions deducted from the salaries of "officials in the Civil Service, and this without "noticing the profits arising from resignations and "discharges, and the Treasury deduction of 20 " per cent." We very sincerely trust that in the discussion which is to take place this day Sir CORiNEWAL Iiawis will abandon this dilatory plea, and make up his mind to render at once to the Civil Servants of the CRowX that measure of justice which has been too long deferred. It may be proper to add that, in addition to the City petition, of which we have already spoken, petitions of a similar tenour have been forwarded by the Magistrates, Clergy, and MIerchants of the Coumty of Norfolk; by the Mayors or Provosts, Magistrates, MIerchants, and other inhabitants of nearly alU the principal towns aud cities of the kingdom, including Edinburgh, Dublin, Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Southampton, Portsmouth, Dundee, Perth, Chester, Leith, Aberdeen, Brighton, Greenock, &c.; and, finally, the Civil Servants themselves have t.his session presented their own petition to the same effect with between nine and ten thousand signatures.

I N.D IA.. THE MUTINY: . OF TE BENGAL ARMYw We have received )>y express from Marseilles, in 4nticipation of the overland mail,' ou letters and papers from India and China. The following letter is from our correspondent In Bombay, and is dated Tune 11:- - I ."The intelligence of the fortnight from- the Beng4l presidency may shortly be summed up "as follows:-Many more regiment.'have mutinied, iwithr more or lesu violence, but the military Authorities have been, for the most part, ready and aTdrt, and the crisis may be said to be past. Delhi has not yet fallen, but we are ia daily, almost houtly, anticipation of;heaing that such a bIow has been atruckc at that centre of revolt as will annihilate the display, if not the spirit, of dietion throughfe out the country. "llaving premised thus much, I will take up my story where I left it at the close of my last Jetter, 'and will write in detail of the occurrences at the various military stations where disaffection has declared itself, or seems yet likely to do so. And firat of the great city of Delhi which- has now been for a month in the hands of the mutineers. Of the number and the names of our countrymen and countrywomen who. have faUen at this place by the hands of the rebels we have atill but imperfect accounts. Many persons regardingi whom the gravest fears were entertained have sincea made their appearance at one or other of the neighbouring stations, and we may hope that the list of those thus preserved will be largely increased, as the native landholders have shown themselves In many cases disposed to give shelterand protection to the fugitives. But the hardships and danger to which they have been exposed must have told meverelyuponthepoor womenandchildren, who escaped withlittlebuttheirlivesfrom thefiranad thebayonet, ind manya tale of hairbreadth escapes from sudden and dreadful death will be told to anxious relatives in Eigland. " I much fear, however, that the number 'of those fromr whom no such consolatory news can be received will, after making all deductiows, Ftil be very large. I sent with my last letter the list of the English whose safety had up to that time been assured. To that list Is to ba added the name of Sir' Theophilus Metcatfe, who it was feared had fallen, but who is safe at Han. With regard to the offlcer, of the three mutinous regiments, the 38th, 54th, and 74th, I have tried in vain toreconcile the lists which have been published of those that have escaped and those that are still missing, the tame names not u'nfrequently appearing in both, and that In one and the sme paper. In the present state of uncertainty I am loth to give the name of any officer as irretrievably lost. I do not, however, observe the name of Lieut. Holland, of the 38th, among those of the refugees at Meerut Umballah, or Kurnaul; nor those of Colonel Ripley, Captains Smith and Burrows; LIeuts. Butler, WVaterfield, and Edwards; Ensign Angelo, and SurgeonDopping, of the 54th; nor of LieutenantaRevely, Hyslop, and Addington, and Dr. Batson, of the 4th. Mr Fraser, the Commissioner, has undoubtedly fallen, and there appears only too much reason to believe a report, emanating from a letter written to the Rajah of Jtullunder by his agent at Delhi, and published in English by the Deputy-Commissioner of the former station, that on Wednesday, the 13th qf May, two days after the outbreak, upwArds of 50 Europeans of both sexes and all ages were discorered in their hidingplaces aud massacred. What the Eing of Delhi has been doing d g this fearfsi time we do 'not know, unless from the letter above alluded to, which represents him, probably with truth,.as having agreed to all the propositions of the armed mutineers, and allowed himself to be placed at the head of the movement. By his own presence and by that of his son he endeavoured, but withouat effect, to restore confidence in the bazaars of the city, and to check the wholesale plundering that was being carried on under the reign of terror. ' The civilization of 53 years has been destroyed irn three hours,' writes the agent, adding, with an exaggeration pardonable under the circumstances, I it is like the atrocities of Nadir Shah.' The soldiery are represented to be without a leader, but other accounts tell us that they have elected to the supreme and second posts of command two native officers of the 3d Light Cavalry. Under this or other leadership they had the temerity to advance from the city and attack i portion of the force collecting to crush them. On the 30th of MIay a detachment of the European force at MIeerut, the Carabineers, 60th Rifles, and Artillery, under the command of Brigadier Wilson, took up an advanced position at the village of Ghazee-ood-deen-nugger, where the road to Delhi crosses the little river of Hindun by a sulspension bridge, some 15 miles from the capital. That same afternoon the enemy appeared in force with five guns on the further side of the stream, and a smart engagement followed. TheBrigadiertookhisArtimery andDragoonsacrossthe riverbyaford,whiletheRiles passed the bridge. They attacked at once in front and flank; the mutineers were doubled up and driven back with the loss of all their guns-part into a burning village, which they themselves had fired, and where they perished miserably; part into the open plain, where they were cut up by the sabres of the Dragoons. Undaunted by this severe check, they returned to the attack on the following day, and were again repulsed. On the 1st of June the Brigadier, whose loss on the first day had been about 40 kiMed and wounded (that on the second is as yet unk-nown), was reinforced, and no further attempt has been made to contest his possession of the bridge and ford. The mutineers have, no doubt, been busily occupied in preparing to receive the army advancing against them from Umballah, for, although there are rumours of desertions fromDelhi, they have probably not been numerous, or the horuemen of Scindia and of the Rajahs of Bhurtpore and Ulwar, not to speak of Agra volunteers, would have had their tale to tell of fugitives intercepted and destroyed. I said in my last that General MAson was expected to leave UmbaUah about the 13th of May. it now appears that his advanced guard reached Kurnaul on the 21st, the main body still remaining forsome days at UJmballah. The cause of this delay was the absence of heavy artillery at that station and the consequent necessity of waiting till a siege-train could be brought from the nearest arsenal, which was as far off as Phillour, on the further side of the Sutlej. When the guns arrived, or were nearing bis camp, the General advanced, and had reached Eurnaul when he was attacked by cholera, and died at that station on the 27th. The command of the army devolved upon Sir Henry Barnard, who as Major-General had been at the head of the Sirhirnd Division. MIeanwhile Brigadier Halifax, with the advance, had arrived at Paneeput,56 miles from Delhi, from which place he moved forward on the evening of the 29th. On the 30th Sir Henry and the-maii body were to iliarch from Kurnaul, and by the morning of the 9th, the day before yesterday, it is thought that the whole force, strengthened by the greater portion of the Meerut Dlvisioih, vhich was to join between Paneeput and Delhi, wrould appear before the revolted capital. Theforce is not quiteo4 large as it was expected to be when. t last wrot6, for it was found necessary to disarm at Umballahtwo of the native corpt-the Sth and 60th-which were to
SECOND EDITION. THB TIMES-OFFICE, Tt&esday Morning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris correlspondent, dated yesterday (Monday), 6 p.m.:- That Russia would have, sooner or lator, carxied out her aggressive policy in the East is admitted even by the most incredulous. She had been long waiting for a pretext, and that pretext the impatient zeal of a French Minister, in the squabbla about the keys and the silver stars, soon furnished. It led to the mission of Prince Menschikoff, the Russian ultirnatumn, the occupation of the Principali±ies, the invasion of the Crimea, and the sanguinary war which ended in the fall of Sebastopol. Had the French Minister at Constantinople been less exacting, it is probable that the occasion so long *waited for iiight still be wanting. The pretensions of France to protect tho Christians of the East who are united to the Latin Church are well known; and they promise, unless measures are taken to icheck the indiscretion and imprudent zeal of her agents, to he productive of much trouble. Private letters from Damascus refer to certain facts that have recently occurred in that place and at Alexandria, and which I think sufficiently interesting not to pass unnoticed. These facts are, I am assured, correctly described; if not, it is easy to contradict or explain them. A memorial, in which they are set fourth, has been, or will soon be, presented to the French Government, and relief demanded. It appears that on the death of the Great Patriarch of the United Catholics at Damascus, the 12 Bishops of the East met together in Council for the purpose of naming a successor, and, as is the custom on such solemn occasions, they also discussed the general condition of their "nation." They at the same tiue drew up a sort of convention, consisting of 12 articles, one of which provided that the newly elected Patriarch should not adopt any resolation relating to the Church without assembling the Bishops in Council ; and, in case a matter of secondary importance occurred, that he should commaunicate by writing to the same Prelates. The convention was sianed, and their seals affixed, by all the members of the Cotuncil in presence of the VicarApostolic of Rome, who also appended his signature and scal; immediately on the completion of this preliminary act Clement Bahus was elected Patriarch. While the Council was still sitting the 'icar-Apostolic expressed his desire that the Gregorian calendar should be adopted by the " nation," on the grounid that it would give much satisfaction at Ronie. The Council replied that such a propositioni was tAtally inadmissible; that it had no concern whatever with religion; and, moreover, that It would be productive of great trouble and conilysion among the population, particularly the lower classes, who, from the foundation of Christianity, were aceistomed to use the Oriental calendar, which contained a great many more saints' feasts than. were found in the Gregorian. r may observe that a similar proposition had been made to the predecessor of the present Patriarch, who, among other grounds of refusal, alleged his fears of a sehism. Fifteen days after his election the new Patriarch, regardless of the decision adopted in council, and to which he had pledged himself, and acting on his own private authority, addressed to the cities of Dainascus, Sidon, Beyrout, Aleppo, St. Jean d'Acre, PFoirzol, Zaalc, Cairo, Alexandria, Ahm6, Hama, Jafisa, and Hloran, all wvhich form an episcopal diocese, as well as to various athar towns, of which the popmations proressed the united uatnonw Lt 'nv, ciroular,in vhicli he preached and recommended the adoptioii of the Gregorian calendar. On receipt of this circular, the popuilations became indignant against the Patriarch, and they loudly protested against such a resolution, adopted as it was without the concurrence or the knowledge of the Council of Bishops. Deterred by this general explosion of 3ndignation, and particularly by the resistance o the Bishops, the Patriarch withdrew his circular, and declared that nothing should be changed in the ancient calendar. Soon after the French Consul at Damascus iniluced the Patriarch to issue a second circular of the same kind. The Patriarch at first refused, not wishing to again incutr the opposition of the people aud tho Bishops; the Consul insisted, he assured the Patriarch that he had nothing whatever to fear from his Bishops or their flock, and that he should protect and support him. In order to remove any further scrniples or apprehensions, lie presented to himt a petitiou, signed by about a hundred inhabitants of Damascus, wvho manifested their readiness to accept the Gregorian calendar. Several persons, who for many yenrs had been under the protection of the French flag were deprived of it by the Consul for havinLg refused to sign the saidl petition. The Patriarob, thus supported and encouraged bythe Con3sul, issued the second circular to the cities anid placos already melntioned. The Bishops and the population againi resisted this arbitrary act; and, with thie exception of Damascus, Alexandria, and Cairo (forming the diocese of the Patriarch), where scarcely a fifth of the iuhabitants joined him, t]ie other cities (comprising the diocese of the Bishop) formally and decidedly declared against him. Immediately after the publication of the circular the Bishops and the principal inhabitants had an interview with the Patriarch; they coniured him, in the most earnest manner, to withdraw his order. The Patriarch, still under the inflaence of the Consul, peremptorily refused to do so, and, moreover, intimated to the inhabitants that those who refused to conform to his circular should be interdicted the use of the church, although it is their own property. The people of Alexandria and Damascus, thus shut out from their place of -worship, purchased a large building, which they fitted up as a churcb, and established there two priests, who celebrated mass and performed the other religious offices for the people. Had not this step been taken many would have at once joined the Greek Schismatic Church. The Patriarch was resolved not to be baffled. He sent an order of suspension to the two priests, and deprived them of the power to perform any sacerdotal functions in Iis diocese. The priests replied that tbey had mnerely done their duty, and that they should forthwith, authorized as they were by the rules of the Churcb, refer the matter to Rorne through the intervention of the Vicar Apostolic, and that in the meantimne they should, with the authorizvtion of the Bishops, continue to celebrate mass, as they reg nrded the suspension as irregular. The inhabitants of Alexandria, troubled at an act which prevented them from the exercise of their worship, as the church.was still shut against those Mwho would not receive the Gregorian calendar, sent a deputation to the Turkish Pasha to expose to him their difficulties with the Patriarch, and to announce the deterwination they had come to of transforming the building above mentioned into a place of worship, ntni such time as the affair was arranged. Tbe Pasha, all Mussulman as he is, said that the Christian population of the empire were, in virtue of the treaty of Paris and the decree of the Sultan, perfectly free to perform their religious services as they though proper, and he instantly sent an order io the police to protect the churches, the priests, an d the congregation, and to see that no impedi. rments should be offered them. The Vicar Apostolic of Alexandria, seeing that the priests continued to officiate in the new churrcia comnianded them, through the French Consul, t) cease performing divine service, and to shut up the building, aS it was not authorized by the Patriarch or the Government. The priests observed that they had the autbority of the Bishops to celebrat' mass, and the sanction of the Government to use the building. Unfortunately the Pasha did not persevere in his original decision. The French Consul had an interviewv with him, and succeeded in obtaining an order for the closing of the church and the banishment of the priests. The indignaTion of the people was great on learning these facts. They demanded, and they still demand, by what right the French Consul, the representative of a great nation where religious tolerance is professed and practised in its full extent, should debar them from the exercise of their worship and the use of their church. A hundred and twenty-two of the principal families of Alexandria instantly went to the Palace of the Russian Gi eek Patriarch, and then and there embraced the schismatic faith. The Russian, who had been previously informed of all these facts, issued forth in procession to meet them. He embraced them affectionately, spoke to them as penitents, and in the effusion'of his heart cried, "This is indeed a great day for my religion-it is truly the fats of God !" I cannot say whether the French Consul and the Vicar-Apostolic of Rome feel regret at thus indirectly promoting, the interests of Russia in the East, and at authorizing an act of gross injustice and tyranny. I only know that the Bishops of the dioceses and their people have prepared a petition to the French Government praying that instructions shall be sent to their Consuls in these countries not to give themselves any further trouble about the changes in the Gregorian calendar ; and to the Consul at Alexandria in particular to permit the church to be re-opened, to restore the banished priests to liberty, and take again under his protection the unfortunate people from whom he has withdrawn it. A letter from Rome mentions that advicas from Damascus state that five bishops of the great dioceses, seeing the apathy of the Patriarch under circumstances which they regard as so serious, had written to Rome, praying that the Council of Bishops should be assembled forthwith to deliborate on the course proper to pursue, but that they, as well as the entire population of their dioceses, and two-thirds of the others, were fully resolved not to accept the Gregorian Calendar sought to be imposed by.the Vicar-Apostolic; and that, if their prayer was neglected, they should be forced, in the words of the letter, " to act according to the rules of the Church." It is hoped that, under the circumstances, the French Government will give orders to its consuils in the East to allow the United Greeks to have as many saints as they think proper in their calendar. The Minister of War has received despatches from Marshal Randon, Governor-General of Algeria, to the 8th instant, announcing, that the submission of the Kabyles is nearly complete. The division of General AlacMahon had placed itself in communication with the division of General Maissiat, who, by orders of the Marshal, attacked the Kabyles by the col of Chellata, to the east. General Maissiat experienced an obstinate resistance, but all the positions of the Kabyles were finally carried after several well contested fights. It is stated as positive that Marshal Randon will conclude his campaign in Kabylia by an expedition against the pirates of the Riff. Cruisers have already been stationed on the coast. In consequence of the Sultan of Anjouan and the Chiefs of the Islands of Comores havingf demanded tn be placed under the protection of France, the Captam ot the screw cutter nauournannayc, Wnxlui hasjust sailed for Mayotte, carries instructions to the Governor of that island to conclude an arrangement to that effect. The Government papers have received notice to suspend their discussions on the question of the Isthmus of Suez and on Lord Palmerston's speech on that subject. The solution of the question of the Transatlantic steam-boats has been adjourned to the month of November next. The Commission appointed to give an opinion on the nautical part of the question have recommended the port of Brest as the point of dcparture. General Trochu, who was severely wounded in the Crimea, and whose wound has re-opened, has left Paris for the baths of Bourbon. The Paris evening papers announce the arrival here of General Sir Colin Campbell, on his way to Marseilles, to embark there on board the Vectis, for India, where he has been appointed Commander-inChief. It is added that Sir Colin is accompanied by several olficers of rank, together with the Commissary-General of the Indian army. This is the dull season for the manufacturers of Paris, and little revival of trade is expected for another month. The increase in the amoulnt of commercial bills discounted by the Bankof France within the last 15 days, as appears in the last returns, cannot consequently he attributed to the ordinary commerce of Paris, but rather to active speculation in silk and wool, or perhaps to the private bankers being compelled to have recourse to the Bank of France for discount, in order to pay the instalments on the new railvay shares just issued by variots companies. A few orders have been received in Paris from country shopkeepers, but the foreign commission agents are making but few purchases, nor has Paris or Lyons as yet benefited much by the redaced Customs' tariff in the United States, -which came into force on the 1st of July. The price of the raw material is stiU excessively high, and the manufacturers bave been forced to accept it. Purchasers for a long time resisted the pretensions of the manufacturers, and this was one of the principal causes of the difliculty in making sales. Nevertheless the stock in the hands of the shopkeepers being exhausted, purchasers were fina'ly compelled to submit. The accounts from the manufacturing districts in the departments announce great dulness. Sales are almost null at Lyons and Saint-Etienne, although the home crop of silk is now aseertained to be more productive than that of last year. But, unfortunately, this is not the case in the silk-growing countries, where prices have risen enormously. For this reason no great diminution in the price of silk manufactured goods can be expected this year. A considerable decline in the price of wheat, and particularly of flour, is to be remarked this week. Speculators who are large holders of flour appear uneasy, and show a disposition to realize, buit they experience great difficulty in finding purchasers even at a reduction of 2f. SOc. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. The rcal value of wvheat will not be known until the harvest is gathered. This operation is retarded by thte want of hands, the Belgian reapers not having arrived this year in such large numbers as formerly. A very decided decline in the price of flour took place in the Paris market last week. The first price asked was 71f. the sac' for the best marlcs, but the brokers were forced to give way, and prices fell to 70f., 69f. 5Oc., 68F., and even to 67f. A slight reaction then took place, and the last quotation was 68f., being a fall of 4f. on the week. Flour for delivery in August was to be had at 66f., but for delivery beyond that date no sales were practicable. The reserve of flour in the market stores continues to increase. It is now 10,000 metrical quintals, and this is a remarkable fact, inasmuch as flour in the stores usually tends to diminish according as the harvea. approaches. Wheat was more firm than flour, nevertheless the offers were very numerous on Wed-. nesday last. Wheat of excellent qualitywas offered at 39£. the weight of 120 kilogrammes. The. quotations from the country markets all show a fall in prices. Accountsfrom A]geria state that the wheat harvest is nearly completed throughout the colony, and that the threshing is progressing as rapidly as the want of hands will permit. Bread was sold in Paris two days since made from wheat of the present year, grown near Blois. The wheat harvest in thaS vicinity appears to be three weeks earlier than usual. In some of the southern departnients, although an extraordinary quantity of locusts injured the crops, still the produce is satisfactory as regards quantity and quality. At Narbonne new wheat ix selling at from 25f. to 2Gf. the hectolitre. The pric3 of wine is looking down. Still the holders of old wines will not abate their pretensions; they will make a reduction only on inferior qualities. The accountsq from the wine-growing districts still continue satisfactory, the flowering of the vine having passed over under favourable circumstances. The late storms of hail and rain have done some damage in Burgmndy and the Bordelais. There is a somewhat better demand for spirits of wine. The 3.6 Languedoc is quoted in Paris at from 238f. to 242?. the hectolitre; spirits distilled from beet-root, aS 117f. A letter from Algiers says that since the 23d April, an interval of about two months and a half, there have been sent from that city to Marseilles abont 12,000 sheep representing a value of abou' 300,0001. This kind of trade is every year acquiring fresh extension, and would be still more so, were not the means of transport so limited. A contract is said to have been entered into for sen - ing 80,000 to France during the summer season, but it is scarcely possible that it can be executAd from the reason above assigned.

You will remember that about five months ago a commission was appointed to inquire into the sys tem of administration in the provinces, and to propose such reforms as might be deemed necessary after a careful examination of the subject. They were not bound to any kind of programme, only the basis o,n w]Sch they had to work was laid down, and this wras'to"followv the principles contained in til Tanzimat and 'in -the Hatti-Eumayoun of last year. The commission has completed its task, and, th) work having received the 'Imperial sanction, its mom; important portion has been officially published. Ii one was not so accustomed to see everything in these regions done differently from what happens in iEurope, one mig,ht writh some reason ba astonished that a vital change can be introduced writh so little noise and pretence, for the new organization ort'te provinces, as projected by the commission, amounts to little more orless than the introduction of communal system based on elections, instead of the systemof Governmental centralization which has been hitherto prevailing. To our sense, this is only going back to the old institutions of the Empire, in which a free communal and provincial administration played a most important part ; but the way in which this return has been effected gives to it the character of one of the greatest innovations ever introduced into this country. Under the old system, abolished by Sultan Mahmoud, the basis of the provincial administration wa the military fiefs. The Pashas sent into the pro - vinces were like so many great barons, with the only diffierence that they were not hereditary,-at least no in principle, though often enough in practice, especially in some of the provinces of Asia Minor, near to the cradle of the Ottoman Power, and in others, such as Bosnia and Albania, which were far outlying. These Paslhas were left almost independent of the central power, but were likewis s made responsible for the revenues andl the military contingent of the provinces. But although Unhampered by the central powver, they were by nz means absolute rulers in their provinces, for, lik the barons of the middle ages, they had their vassals in the Derebeys, Sipahis, &c.,who were oftea as troublesome, if not more so, than in EBurop 3- They were either the descendants of the ol 1 families of the country, dating from before th , Conquest, or the sons of deserving warriors whz established themselves with the Turkish rule. Nay, the thing went even further, for the rural communities as well as the towns, as such, were likewise, at least in principle, and often in practice, too independent as regarded the administration of their owa. local affairs. But by degrecs the systematic efforts of the Pashas in the provinces had succeeded, if not in abolishing, at least in neutralizing in a great measure, all those minor powers which controlled their actions, so that towards the end of the last century they had almnost become shadows of their former existence. The destruction of this military aristocracy was invariably the precursor of the revolt of the Pashas against the central power. Let us take only the last two instances-Mli l:asha, of Yannina, and hIhemet Ali, of E,gypt. The first carried on a sanguinary war for more than 20 years against the Albanian chiefs, which at last broke their power; and the latter had to exterminate the Mamelukes before either dared to declare against the Porte. WShen Mahmoud introdnced his reform his only idea was to centralize all power at Constantinople; and, even if he had been aware of the evil which must naturally follow such a centralization, he could not have done otherwise, for the minor powers, which had formerly possessed a certain right of selfgovernment in the provinces, were either altogether destroyed, or at anyratehad sunkinto ahopeless state of confusion; besides, the simnultaneous introductioa of a regular army on the European model was a protest against the very principle on which the iastitution of military fiefs reposed; but such c-n- tralization without any counterpoise could not last. The Hatti-Scherif of Gulhan6, and its corollary, the Tanzimat, laid down the first stone for a neabarrier against central power by creating provincial and district councils. It would have been too much to ask that this first attempt sbould be altogether successful,-nor was it so; and up to this present moment these councils are what theFrench would call uame mauvaise plaisanL terie, According to the letter of the regulations the members of these counoils ought to be elected, bat in reality there are in every chief place of a government, province, or district a number of influential people, who, under the protection of the Pashas and Kaimakans, elect themselves, so that not only is the province or district, as such, never represented, but only the capital of the province or district, but even in the capitals of the provinces and districts only a few families. The same happens in the communities, whether Christians or Mahomedan. Now the project of the Commission remedies this by regulating the manner of election and extending it over the whole province or district. The provincial subdivisions were hitherto ill-defined; the first care, therefore, of the Commission was to regulate somewhat the anomalies in this respect. Twenty communities at most, that is, from 2,000 to 4,000 houses, form one nahiy6, or what might be called by analogy "hundred," which will have a jury for the maintenance of the peace, a chamber of conciliation, a tribunal of police, and a municipal council. Three nahiyes at least and five utawets form a caza, or district. Three cazas or from 9 to 15 nahiye's form a liva, or province, in the capital of which are the courts of appeal. From two to seven livas form an eyalet or government, in the capital of which are the assizes and the great council. For the administration there is to be a Municipal Council in each nahiy6 or district, composed at least of five persons, under the presidency of the Mudir. All inhabitants paying 100 piastres of land-tax will assemble every second year in the chief place to elect a member for each 500 houses. Tf it should occur that all the members thus elected should belong to one community, or if communities numbering at least 200 houses should not be represented the electors of such communities will be assembled to elect a second time a member for each 500 houses. Father and son together, near relatives, paid employis, and members of other councils are not eligible. Here, then, you have property qualification as the basis of political rights. There is, very wisely, no question about religion. At the same time precautions are taken that the elections should not become the affairs of a clique, as hitherto. The provincial councils are composedon similar principles and chosen by the same electors, one member for 2,000 houses, and the same precautions are taken to ensure the rights of the minority. The provincial council thus elected will assess the taxes, recover arrears for the Treasury, make contracts for local constructions and reparations, and all others having reference to local matters of the province. It judges on differences between districts and communities, and superintends roads and sanitary regulations. Thus you see the provinces will have the administration of their local affairs entirely in their own bands. This interest created in local affairs will, you may depend, do more to bring the members of the different religions together than any order to shake hands expressed in a Hatti-Humayoun. The general councils in the governments will be composed of from 10 to 18 members. Each province will send two elected in the same way as the members of the other councils ; and the province in which the Governor-General resides will send onehalf of the number sent by the other provinces. They are courts of appeal in all admiuistrative affairs and differences between provinces and districts. The projects of the Commission separate strictly the different branches of justice. In the conciliation of private differences there will be a kind of jury likewise elected in each nahiy6. There will be a similar court for conciliation in commercial affairs. All merchants paying 500 piastres taxes are electors. In each liva there will be a tribunal of commerce similarly elected. All affairs exceeding 5,000 piastres will be judged by the Todjeret Khan6, in the capital. For criminal justice there is a police conrt in each nahiy6, composed of four members, under the *Naib, or Justice of the Peace. Allinhabitants pay- ing more than 100 piastres will chose 20 members for two Years. four of whom -will clnn slrt.yin rritastion. It will have the power of imprisonment for three days, of 15 piastres fine, and of indemnities up to 250 piastres. Each district is to have a tribunal of correctional police, composed of a judge and two councillors. Each liva has a tribunal of inquiry and instruction, composed of seven members, elected by all inhabitants of 25 years of age and paying 300 piastres of taxes, and of four named by the authorities. In each government there will be a court of justice, which will hold assizes. This court will be composed of a president,two councillors,a procureurgeneral, his assistant, a greffier and his assistant-in all seven functionaries; and 12 members of the jury. These jurymen will be taken in turn from a list of names taken by the authorities from among the respectable inhabitants of the wihole government paying 500 piastres in taxes, at the rate of one for 5O0) houses. Here we have, then, likewise, the jury introduced in Turkey. It is needless for me to point out any further the importance of these projected reforms, for they speak for themselves, and, if Redschid succeeds in starting the thing fairly, he has, indeed, laid down the basis for a future. It is from below that the building must btgin, else it will not stand. It is intended to introduce these important innovations in the government of Broussa, and there can be no doubt they will be found to answer. I have only to add the name of the man who was the soul of the Commission and to whose mind and labour the whole project belongs almost exclusively. It would be unjust not to mention him. It is Ahmed Vefik Effendi, of whom I have already had occasion to speak as one of the most rising men of the new generation of Turkish statesmen. You can now jiudge him by his work. SPAIN. (FRomii oUR Owv coRR:aEsFox.E.) MADRID, JTVTY 9. The hopes entertained that Senor Lafragua's visit to Madrid might lead to an amicable adjustment of the quarrel between Mexico and Spain are, it is to be feared, at an end. At a final conference, it has been founid impossible to reconcile the pretensions of both parties. The point immediately at issue is that of compensation to the snfferers by the outrages vhich are the origin of the dispute. Senor Pidal inisists on such compensation being at once consented to. Senor Lafragua, denying that this demand is justified by the law of nations or the common piinciples of justice, declines acceding to it untilthe result of the judicial investigations at present going on in his country shall show on whom the blame really rests. As neither party can be induced to stir from his position, all negotiation in Madrid must be considered as terminated, and it is probable that Senor Lafragua will leave Spain without delay, and that Lord Howden will no longer postpone his proposed departure. The treaty between England and Spain, for the mutual protection of literary property, was sigaed here on Tuesday afternoon, and sent off yesterday morning by Captain Blaekwood to London. The Post-office Treaty still hangs fire. The disturbances in the south seem to be at an end. A nunmber of prisoners has been made; one or two have been shot by sentence of court-martial, and others are to be transp.rted beyond seas. A>cording to some accounts, great excesses were committed by the inisurgents, who burnt, pillaged, murdered, and outraged women wherever they went. The Civil Governor of Seville has been changed. It is rorthy of remark that this movement among tho democrats in the south of Spain coincides with the attempts in Sardinia and Naples, and also, very nearly, with the conspiracies discovered in Paris. The sales of wvheat in yesterday's Madrid corn market ranged from 96 to 100 reals 'the fanega, which is equal to 302s. to 106s. the English quarter. It is difficult to understand how prices are thus maintained, in presence of a magnificent harvest, already partly gathered in. In Valencia there is plenty of new wheat, in Andalusia the liar. vest is progressing rapidly, and in La Mancha it is beginning. In the vicinity of Madrid there ara many fields tipe anid fit for the sickle. Yet wheat pertinaciously maintains itself at 51. a quarter. The idea is very general here that there is foul play somewhere. People accuse the Government of lending itself to a gigantic monopoly, the profits of which it shares, and the idea is the more readily received because the opinion of most people here is that there is no profitable iniquiity of which this Government is not capable. Proofs are at pre3ent p wanting, bat the circumstances are very suspici- I ous. The supposed operation would probably have been confined chiefly to MIadrid, where prices have been disproportionately higher j than in incist other parts of Spain. I have I no paper at hand showing the prices of corn during the present year in the different great Earopean markets ; but I percoive that the quarterly return shows the average price in England and Wales for the Midsumnier (quarter to have been 56s. 9d.; and, considering Soain's convenient position, and her numerous ports facing every point of the compass, it is difficalt to believe that here, with proper and honest management, prices might not ere now have been considerably reduced by importation. It must be remembereit that Spanish ports have long been open for the free entrance of foreign grain. What is most surprising, however, is to see that even the now harvest fails to bring down prices. It was reported yesterday that there was plenty of new Valencia corn at Albacete, but that itwas not allowed to come on to Madrid. This, however, seems very improbable, although nothing of that kind is impossible in this country. It is worthy of note that, in the budget for 1857, (th repo t of the Committee on which was yester- ay presented to the Chamber,) a sum equal to 600,0001. sterling is put down for the purchase of wheat and subsidies to the bakers, in order to supply the lower classes at a cheap rate, and, as it is here said, " to vanquish the difQicult question of subsistence ;" in short, to help the country through the severe scarcity. It is very easy to understand, from the above miscellaneous data, how a corruptGovernment might, with or even without the aid of one or two capitalists, have combined a most profitable operation, ;>nd this is what people have for some time past talked of, but now the murmurs are louder and the charges more decided than ever, for it is considered that the monopolists are betraying themselves by their own greediness, since it is deemed impossible that wheat should be maintained by fair means at its present price. With the exception of a very few districts the harvest is quite first-rate. There is also a remarkably fine crop of the garbanzo, or chick pea, a very iniportant article of consumption in Spain, forming, as it does, an essential part of the daily dinner of 19 Spaniards out of 20. It is estimated that an abundant corn harvest in this country affords subsistence for three years. The Three per Cents. were done at 38.90; ditto Deferred, 26.80. AIMERICA. (BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.)

The junks are again, we hear, appearing in large numbers, and in Fatshan-creek over 100. most of them of the largest size, were anchored, and batteries were erected on shore, the Chinese being. apparently under the imprcesion that an attack on Fatshan was contemplated by our forces. We hear it is the intention, as soon as the gunboats are ready, to clear the creeks of the numerous junks, which, being in the vicinity of our ships, give the Chinese opportunities of causing considerable annoyance. The Tee-totum Fort is now garrisonedby 3nert from the Raleigh. We understand the tenders for raising Her M.ajesty's ship Raleigh were very high-from $40,000 to $50,000. It is likely she will be sold where she now liesr and Commodore Keppel will hoist his flag on board one of the vessels in the harbour, the Admiral being desirous at the present time to have the services of such an officer as Commodore Keppel. There have been lately some noble additions to the naval force in these waters. Her Majesty's steamer Highflyer, Captain Shadwell, arrived on the 13th of May with the gunboats Forester, Haughty, Plover, and Opossum. Two of the gunboats were in charge of the steamer from England; the other two she fell in with at the Cape, and one or either was always towing for a distance of-say, 13,000 miles. Seven of these small boats have now arrived here without meeting accident. Her Majesty's steamfrigate Tribune, Captain Edgell, arrived here froma the Sandwich Isles on the 14th1inst. She sailed from Honolulu on the 10th o£ ApriL Her Majesty's ship Amethyst, Captain T. Grenfell, arrived on the 23d inst. from Singapore. The steamer Highiflyer left for the Pratas ShoaI on the 14th inst., as it was reported some Chinese from the Anna (British owned), wrecked there on the 10th inst., were on the shoal. They must have got off in junks, as no one belonging to the vessel was seen. The steamer returned here on the 19th inst. A short time since the bodies of two foreigners, lashed back to back, were seen in the water nesr Macao. One had, apparentlv, been beheaded, and the other disembowelled. Our advices from the coast do not contain anything of much importance. The accounts appear to be more satisfactory as regards the state of the country in the interior. At Ningpo another disturbance had taken place between the Portuguese lorcha men and the Canton boatmen, the latter assisted by some French Eailors. The cause of these riots is That the Portuguese endeavour to monopolize the convoying system, andu they are apparently heedless of their consular authority. Our Foochow advices are to the 19th inst. Less uneasiness was felt about the rebelE, and fresh efforts were being made to send money into the country for investment in tea: zix small chops new Congous have arrived from neighbouring districts,. the quality not equal to No. 1 Kishows, and after considerable competition sold for 33S taels to 334 tsels. Shipped off similar teas last year were bought at 23 taels to 26 taels. One vessel, the Queen of MIar, had been despatched to England, and three, were on the berth. Her Majesty's steamer Sampson and brig Camilla were at Foochow. Amoy letters are to the 20th inst. Disturbances in the neighbourhood had interfered with trade, but at the last less uneasiness was felt. At Hougkong all remains quiet. We have to mention the stoppage of payments by the American firm, MIessrs. King and Co. Their liabilities are said to be under $150,000, mostly due to Chinese. His Excellency Sir John Bowring has intimated that he has been informed by Lord Clarendon that compensation for losses lately sustained by British subjects wvill be demanded from the Chinese Government. In trade here we have few transactions to report. A few parcels of tea and silk have been bought at Macao at extreme prices. Cotton is quoted-Bengal, $9. to $10i; Bombay, $101 to $111. Cotton yarn, Nos. 16-24, nominally $25; Nos. 28-32, $30 to $33; Nos. 38-42, $40 45. Shirtings.-There has been a little inquiry for e3 catty. Grays, at $2 10 to $2 15. Rice has fluctuated; supplies from the interior had caused a considerable decline in plices at Canton. Quotations here are, Bengal, $3 70 to $3 90 Siam, $3 50 to $3 80; Arracan, $3 40 to $3 50.

No. 3 Tsatlee quoted c400; Taysaam, middling to fair, $320 to _350. The new crop was expected to be abundanit and of good quality. Some would be on the market in about a fortnight. The export from China to Great Britain, 7 4,200 bales; Marseilles, 12,800 bales; total, 87,000 bales. In tea the business was limited; two chops Ningelow tconigou had been settled at 17 taels to 22 taels. Masters of the new teas were expected in a month or two hence.

.INDIAN COMIMERCIAL INTELLIGENCLE. THE BOMBAY MARKET (From the Bombay Times.) FuRONt TUB 27TH OF dlxv TO Tl[E 1OTIe OF JUNE. The English mail from London of the 11th vlt., per Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Ganges, reached Bombay on the night of the 5th int. The tightness in our ruorsey-u.arker, reported in our last, hls increased duxring the pait fortaight. and the banks have gaia raised their rates of interest 1 per coet aU round, and as there is at tresent a sort of panic in the bazAar it is probable we may have to record in our next a much worse stats of matters than now exists.

The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Bentinek, with the London mail of the 26th of April, arrived hore on the 2d inst. The advices brought by her had already been anticipated by the electric telegraph and the Dak from Bombay. During the fortuight under review our produce-market has experienced no alteration. If anything, business has been stil more curtailed in consequence of the extreme prices of all goods and the inability to negotiate bills unless at enhanced rates of exchange. Our market, moreover, is not yet sufficiently supplied, and, with the exception of raw silk and one or two uuinor articles, operations in other staples have been very small. Raw silkhas been parchased to a moderate extent at a slight advance, thongh transactions are limited to a few purchasers only. We have had aothing doing in corahs, in consequence of holders having raised their demnands by 5r. a corge, Sugar of all qualities is again higher by aboutt 4 annas per maund wVith little doing at this advance. Saltpetro continues to be taken by the Americans to a moderate extent, to mreet their engagements of tonnage, and value drooping. Lae dye and shell lao without change, a sale of the latter of the DO mark having been effcted at IS rupees per maund. Linseed in mcderate request fur itierica, chiefly at unaltered rates. In rape, tee, and poppy also a very smaU business in progress at previous 6 res. Safflower in less demand, and likely to rule lower. inte in limited inquiry at our last extreme rates. As regards our import-market our report, we regret to observe, must be more unfavourable. The mutinous pro. ceedings of tho native troops in the north-west provinces and the distarbed state of the country have caused considerable sensation among native dealers, and business therefore has been almost at a standstill. Tihe difficulty, moreover, of obtaining tonnage in the np-country steamers, which are required for Government purposes, has likewiso tended to restrict operations, and the sales consequently in British cotton piece goods since our last liave been exceedingly limited. But as yet importers have not submitted to any decline in prices, thouigh this is not very unlikely viewing the present aspect of aff.irs. "M boney-market.-The rates of the Bank of Bengal con. tinue unaltered, but in the bazar buisinless is done on easier terms, the abundance of available funds enabling native capitalists to accept lower rates than those charged by the local banks. It appears from the last weekly statement of the liabilities and assets of tlse Bank of Bengal, dated the 27th nilt., which wo insert below, that the cash in the bank has further increased, amounting now to Company's ruapees 1,63,29,53S.2.10.

Government Securities.-Depreciated last week, chiefly ia consequenco of the disturbances in the north-west, which created a temporary alarm in certain quarters, and an impression secns to prevail among the native dealers and capitalists that the heavy losses and expenditures to wlhieh Government will be subjected will render necessary the borrowing of a larger sum than what has beers already advertised for; but the securities again rallied at the cornmnencement of this week and Company's Fours were placed at rs. 13 8. During the last two days, howevor, the market has again taken an unfavourable turn, and we now quote Company's Fours at rs. 14-12, Sicea Fours at rs. 16-4 to rs. 16-S per cent. discount. Exchange.-On London.-The marketopenedfortbe present rmail at 2-1l, but rose alniost iunmediately to 214, at which it continued steady till the 1st inst., when bills to some extent were offered, and there being no buiyers at the latter rate, an advance to 2-1 took place, and this is the closing quotation for first-class six mounths' sight credits. Some 110 days- sr-ht hill hae en lae a - . Ban petr 6daays'sightbhills have beenplacedtsl Bank posters are scarce at 2s., document bills may bh quoted at 2b14 in the early part of the mail, and 2-1lk to-day. On China.-We hear of a sale since the departure of the last direct steaner at 227 rupees per 1,10:. Freights.-There has scarcely heen any alteration in the rates since tie date cf our last. and tlie business done during the past fortnight we finid to have beens on a moderate scale, chiefly owing to thesmall supplies and Iigh prices of produce in our market. This circutustance has checked improve- mer.t in freiglhts, which otherwise might have taken place considering the small amount of available tonnage in our port. For London wve still quote 51 0s. per ton aU round, and for Liverpool, 41. 2s. 6d.; but there is not much willingness on the part of consignees of ships to accept these rates. For America, gl4 per ton ; Wrest Indies, 41. ; Australia, 41. lOs. to 41. l5s.; 3lediterranean 41. to 51. 5s. ; Levant, fl. os. to oC. lOs.; Continent, 41. 15s. to 61. ; Mauritins, rs. 1 10 to ro. 1-12 a hog(; China, 4,l a bag; Straits of Malacca, 20rs. to 2.5rs. er to_n; Batavia, 3grs. to 40rs; France. 140f.; Akyab, oulmein, and Rangoon, 20rs. to 2.Trs.; 3Madras and Colombo, 20rs. to 25rs.; and Bombay, ,?D-s. per ton.

Several of the officers of the 42d Highlauders met Sir Coln at the South-Eastern station and escorted their old and' gallant commander to the Admiralty- pier, where they gave him three hearty cheers as the steamer got sader way.
MONEY-MA RKJfBtland CITYIN TLLIC4NT Q. Monday Evening. Although it is assumed that the fuill despatches rom India to-morrow will contain details of many painful casualties, the general bearing of the telegraphic accounts has been almost universaUy regarded as less unfavourable than might have been apprehended. The funds, hovever, opened at a further decline of an eighth, and scarcely rallied throughout the day. Consols for monev were first quoted 92 to i, and after having advanced to 92i to i they returned to 92i for money and 92a for the 6th of August. Apart from any re-assurance to be derived from the Indian news, the arrival of another quarter of a million sterling from Australia and a rather heavy fall on tbe Corn-Exchange were calculated to support the market, but the speculative purchases open are so large that the operators are rendered nervous, and avail ther selves of every opportunity to bring their risks within narrower compass. The politicel state of France and Italy also adds to their disquietude. Late in the afternoon it was announced that 6,000 men are forthwith to be sent to India, in addition to the 14,000 already in course of embarcation, and that duringtheir absence the militia will be again called out; and these measures, while they should impart confidence from their vigour, bring the puLblic to an immediate sense of the importance of the crisis, and add to the general excitement. Bank Stock left off at 213 to 215; Reduced, 924 to i; New Three per Cents., 921 to i; India Stock, 215 to 217 ; India-bonds, 15s. to Bs. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 9S8 to 99; and Exchequer-bills, 3s. discount to par. The rate for money in the Stock-Exchange ranged from 5 to 5i per cent. In the discount-market the supply was abundant, and at the Bank there were hardly any applications. Foreign securities have been extensively dealt in, inmost cases at an advance, -which, however, wa3 not maintained to the close. Many speculative sales took place in Turkish Six per Cents., which left off I per cent. lower ; but the Four per Cents. Guaranteed were supported by some considerable purchases. Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 1852, were negotiated at 962- 7 ; Portuguese, for the account, 441; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 9k 96 ; Sardinian, 90k 89. ; Spanish, for the account, 40 40k; ditto, New Deferred, for the account, 251 i ; the Certi6cates, 5g ; Turkish Six per Cents., 950 ; for the account, 95o 1- i- - J 94g; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, 102 k i ; Austrian, 804; and Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97. In the corn-market this morning there was a fall of between 3s. and 4s. from tho rates of MIonday last. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 80c. for money and 66f. 95c. for the end of the month, showing continued heaviness, but only a fractional further decline. The quotations of the rates of exchange from India and China are again rather obscure, but the impression is that on the average they show no material alteration. At Bombay there has been a rise of 2 per cent., while at Calcutta, Shanghai, and Hongkong the tendency seems to have been more favourable for this country. The private despatches from China state the exports of tea to date at 58,500,OOOlb., and of silk 73,600 bales. Very little was doing in produce. The Foochow tea-market had opened at 33 taels, and fine descriptions were scarce. It appears that the intelligence received from India on Saturday was sent by the Governor of Malta to'Cagliari, and thence by telegraph to the Government. The Mediterranean Extension (Malta and Corfn) Submarine Cable, in course of manufacture, is to join at Cagliari, and will be laid down and delivered over to the company in October next by the contractors, when a saving of four or five clays will be effected over the route vid Marseilles. The gold from Melbourne by the James Baines is 241,256?., making with the arrivals of Saturday a total of 462,6881., a large proportion of which is expected to be taken to the Bank. The specie from America to-day is only 91,0001., the port of departure being Boston, and there will be no additional arrival this week. The Persia on Monday next will probably bring a large sum. The advices on this occasion describe a continuance of the faU in the stock-market. New York Central had gone from 80 to 77, and Reading from 71 to l67. Erie and Panama were less unsteady, and were respectively quoted 27 and 91k; Illinois Central had slightly recovered, the latest transactions having been at 123. The report of the Bank of New South Wales, presented on the 22d of April, at Sydney, has been received by the James Baines. It states the amount available for distribution to have been 64,4761., out of which 50,0001. was appropriated to a dividend at the rate of 20 per cent. per annum, and 13,0001. to the reserve fund (which now stands at 140,0001.), leaving 1,4231. to be carried forward. At HIamburg the pressure for money has slightly abated, and the rate of discount has receded to 7 per cent. The doUars brought by the last West India packet have been sold at 60;d., showing a decline of id. from the price realized last month, but the market has been dull ever since, and even a lower quotation than the present has been current. It is too early to form an estimate of the probable shipments by the next overland mail, but it is thought they will be comparatively moderate. The trade reports from the manufacturing towns describe dtilness at Manchester, buyers for India holding back for the mail, while the inducements for production are also diminished by the continued firmness in the cotton-market. At Birming- ham great confidence is manifested in the iron trade, owing to large orders for the United States and India, and the expectation of a considerable demand for Russia under the new tariff. The general trades of the place have been dull. At Nottingham business has been inactive both in lace and hosiery, especially the latter. In the woollen districts there has been steadiness, and in the Irish linen-markets, although the transactions have not been large, an advance has been realized. Intelligence rcached the city this mornina of the death of MIr. Lavie, of the firm of Oliverson, Lavie, and Peachey, by a fall from his horse. Mr. Lavie and Mr. James Freshfield, whose death was announed seven weeks back, were the two most eminent commercial lawyers in London. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day a petition was opened on behalf of the assignees of the Royal British Bank against Mr. Loran de Wolf Cochran, shipowner and merchant, of South Sea House, and who was also one of the directors of the Royal British Banlk. A special ueeting of the North British Australasian Company was beld to-day, to sanction the registration under limited liability, and to make the necessary alterations in the contract of copartiery. The chairman read the proposed regulations of the company, as amended, anid, after some discussion, their further consideration was postponed to the 27th inst. Mr. Edmund Denison, the chairman of the Great Northern Railway, has given in a characteristic letter what he considers to be his side of the question with regard to the cost of Redpath's frauds being thrown upon the preference shareholders. Both parties have spoken, and the public therefore may now judge. The facts of the case as they are understood stand simply thus:-From neglect of duty on the part of Mr. Denison and his colleagues, I Redpath, through a series of years, was able to issue large amounts of fictitious stock. The fraud was discovered only in a lump, and then the point was how should it be met. The preference shareholders, whose cause has lately been advocated, are entitled at alltimes to their full dividend before the ordi- nary shareholders can receive anything. If the frauds had been provided for year by year as they occurred these parties would conseI quently have suffered nothing. There would in each year have been not only enough to pay them, but even to leave a fair dividend for the others. Owing to the mismanagement of the directors, however, the sharebolders remained in ignoranec of wh u was going on, and thus each I year divided among themselves amounts to which they were in no way entitled. When the aggregate loss became known, were they to refund what they had improperly taken; should they meet it by a creation of stock, or by gradual appropriations for the future; or, should they take the amount out of the current half-year's receipts ? In the latter case there would not be enough to meet the claims of the preference shareholders, and, as these parties had never received a shilling to which they were not entitled, and it was, moreover, a stipulation in their Act that their dividend was to be so much perannura, thus enabling them to claim that the loss should, at all events, be tbrown over an entire year, in which case they would have had to contribute nothing, the injustice of such a proposition was at once admitted. The directors, said Mr. Denison, " cannot support any Bill that would throw upon the Preference Stock any portion of the loss, and thereby shake the confidence of the public in all such stock." Thus far all was well, and the tone taken by the directors induced shareholders of all classes to trust them with their proxies, for in E;ngland there is rarely any disposition to sharp practice among such bodies, unless it is prompted by those who are officially supposed to know what is best. At a subsequent meeting, howvever, it turned out that there was some legal difficulty to prevent the deficiency being met, as had been proposed, by a creation of stock; and then the directors, as if they had no other alternative, adopted and carried a measure to admit of throwing it upon the current halfyear. An alternative suggested to MIr. Denison as the proper one by the chairman of committees of the House of lLords, that it should be made up from the future dividends of himself and his colleages, was carefully suppressed, and so obscure were the proceedings, and so adroit the conf a- sion generated, that many of the parties destined to be mulcted seemed until the eleventh hour to have no consciousness of what was intended. In calm trast upon Mr. Dentison's assurance they gave no further heed to the matter. Illtinmately it appeared that the proxies obtained by the directors when they professed an intention to act justly by the preference shareholders were used to carry the day against them. The Bill for the proposed arrangement, therefore, was introduced into the Commons, and lately went through its second reading in the Lords, with a strong protest against its injustice by Lord St. Leonard's and Lord WYensleydale. On Wednesday last a meeting of the shareholders was called to approve it, and, asthepreference holders, whose rights are compromised, constitute only a fraction of the entire body of voters, they of course had little chance, especially as Mr. D:enison on the occasion exhibited that high mode of dealing with minorities of which Mr. Hudson may claim to have been the originator. But the Bill had still to pass the committee of the Lords, and the victims expected that here their case would be recognized, or that, at all events, they would learn in what it is defective. To their astonishment, however, witheut any new light being thrown upon it, the Bill was sanctioned forthwith, and to-morrow it will go through its third reading, which will, it is presumed, be merely a matter of form. In reviewing the whole affair Ivr. Denison takes elevated ground. HIe does not deny his first avowval that the measure is of such a character as to destroy the confidence of the public in all preference shares, nor even assert that his conviction on that point is changed, neither does he justify the suppression of the recommendation of Lord Redesdale, that as a penalty for their gross neglect he and his colleagues should take the burden on themselves. The shareholders, he says, are the persons who are answerable for what has been done. Mr. Denison used their proxies, but they must be respons,ible for his mode of using them. This is the whole gist of his statement. T he rest consists of a sneer at the snfferers, an unfounded allegation that they have endeavoured by a side wind to exalt their shares into the superior condition of guaranteed shares, and an insinuation, such as is happily now heard, perhaps, for the first time fromn an English gentleman, that the law lords who spoke against the Bill, and wthose whole lives have been characterized by the habit of dismissingv every personal feeling from their judicial functions, were biased by sordid motives. Mr. Denison laughs at the idea of his opponents being astonished at the result of the hearing before thle Lords' committee. Considering how many persons, if they had been in his position, would have been depressed by self-reproach after thA Redp)ath discovery, to say nothjnz of clisingenuousness subsequently exercised, his determination to ignore the whole, and to throw taunts and accusations againt all comers, will now at least furnish food for that emotion. ar

THE ,NA-PIERS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-I know not vwo sent to the United Seivice Ga2etie the statement about Sir a. Napier and the heroic young Willoughby; nor do I know who the person is that contradicted that statement,under the signature of "A Relative," -n your journal, It wouald seem that there needed no squeamish scruples, no mock modesty, to prevent the real name being affixed to the acknowledgment of a generous action; but the "Relative," under pretext of hastening to show gratitude to Mr. Whiteman, really hastened to be ungrateful to Sir C. Napier. Sir 0. Napier did give Mrs. Willoughby a sbrong letter of recommendation for her son, saying ho did not think any director would attend to his recommendation. Mrs. Willoughby did show that letter to Mr. Whiteman, and that gentleman, with a noble spirit, told her that he had designed a cadetship in his gift for another, but the company owed so much to Sir C. Napier that his recommendation should be first attended to. Mr. Whiteman did more: on the strength of the same recommendation he afterwards gave a second cadetship to her other son ! It was a knowvledge of this fine sentiment and conduct, and a further k-nowledge of the sentiments of the late General Caulfield, also a director, that made me, in al my censures of the directors as a governing body, emphatically state that there were honourable exceptions-men of exalted temper and dispositions among them- W.

MR.. Rusnn AT L&NsscnEsTr.-On Friday evening Mr. John Ruskin delivered a lecture at the Manchester Athenceunm on the connerion between art and political economy. There was a good attendance, but the numnbers were below what might have been expected from the lecturer's fame. The lecturer read a very eloquent address, in which he contended that what wvas wanted to foster art was a truly paternal Government, the type of which he took from a farm not governed by a master and with hired servants, bat where the master vwas the father and the servants were sons. Such a person might sometimes make laws that would be irksome, but just then was the timo when it was most necessary to obey them; and so it was vwith a wise nation. This kind of national law we had hitherto made judicial only, but he thought as we advanced in social knowledge we should endeavonr to make the Government p aternal as well as judicial, and have authorities who would protect us in our follies and visit us in our distresses. The lecturer went tn to show how the art talent of the country would be best collected nunder such a Government, and how best trained. In addition to Government schools to encourage the youth, in aU large towns he would have schools where al the idle farm lads could go who had beenputtounsuitableoccupations. Whatwas wautedwasthat all the talent we possessed should be developed, and that it should be so fostered as not to sour or distort the mind of the student when under training. Having shown how he could be best trained, the lecturer proceeded to show how our art labour might bo best employed, so as to produce the greatest and most lasting results to the nation, and criticized severely thetasteswhich led to the production of the clhe rather than the good, as shown in the cheap illustrate papers, and the ephemeral rather than the lasting, as shown in the watercolour drawings of the last 20 years, neither the colours nor the paper being capable of durability. Mr. Runsin delivers his secone. lecture this evening. [Advertisement.]-" Deads, not Words : a Home Story, by M. Ionll, prIce 2s. bx,ar s, nsow ready.

TEH CORN TBADB. mARx-I.rAF, MozAY AFTERNooN JrLY 13. Lat week's arrivals were generaUy moderate. The ex. ports were 2,001 quarters wheatk 456 quarters barley, 49 quarters oats. The receipts of home-grown wheat wero 3,600 quartcrs, the foreign 8,0o8 quarters. From Kent and Essex the morninges -upply was very small, but the continued prevalence of extremely fine weather disposed factors to make offers at 3s. per quarter lees money; stil millers generally preferred waiting, and the little business effected was at a decline of fully 3s. to 4s. per quarter since Monday last. To sell forelgn a decline would also have been necessary, but; I holders wero indisposed to press sales. Of country flour there were 14,158 sacks, of foreign, 978 sacks, 493 barrels. lorfolks were offered at 3s. per sack reduction, tho day's price being 43s. Foreign samples were also Is. per barrel and sack lower, but not townmade. The qwantity of English barley was 226 quarters, the foreign being 5,423 quarters. Business was on a very small scale, but prices of sweet parcels were unchanged. A sample of new from Kent was on the market of fine colour and heavy, held at ahigh price. The malt trade nnderwent no alteration. The total supply of oats was only 15,761 quarters, of which 233 were English, 3,650 quarters Irish, and 11,878 quarters foreign. The fineness of the weather did not therefore re. duce prices, sweet corn being firm. Of beans there were 465 quarters, exclusively English. Of peas there were only 17 quarters English, and 440 quarters boilers from Konigsberg. Both these descriptions of pulse were firm, especially fine small beans, which in some instances commanded higher prices. The receipts of linseed were only 50 quarters foreign por coast, and the exports 800 quarters. Prices both of seed and ca-e were firmly maintained. In the seed tradwery little was passing. The samples of new offering weretrifolium incarnatum of fair quality, trefoil, carraway, and some fine-coloured rapeseed-the latter held at a high price. Canary was rather dearer. In cloverseed, trefoil, and coriander no change of value was noted. Astalol Com in the Port o! londou, from July 6 toJuly 3 . UUSIiT PRICXS OF }RITISH GRAIN AND FLOUP.

He was born on the 13th of October, 1797, and entered the army at an early age in the 3d or Scots Fusileer Guards, with which regiment he served at the battle of Waterloo. He continued tel Guards until he obtainecl the rank of Lieutenant. Colonel in May, 1825, -when he was placed on half-pay. He was for. many years a member of the House of Commors, having been returned to that assembly in ISIS for Great Yarmouth, which he represented in several Parliaments before and after the passing of the Reform B3I. In February, 1836, he was elected, on tho death of hr.

Mr. O'ALIJLEY yesterday replied upon, the wholeo case on e counel commencrA b observing that unless the committee thought that C(lo nefl igeins was duly elected it would be far better thr.j g Moore slxould be allowred to retein his seat than t' jM t4 mockery of another election should be gone thro,gh, VIe contended, however, that Mr. Moore was, by tl'.o Gtrupt Practices Act, not only unsmtejl, but debard from again presenting himself an avamoidate for a Eeat in, the present Parlianeat, by the udwc influence which aad boea exer. oised in order to procure his retar The learned counsel then proceeded to comment pon all th'a evidwscoe which biad been addieced, contending that it -rovet beyond a ,doubt theoxsitence'of an organiled corAspraoy on the part ,of the priests df tlte diocese if Mayo to efect the return, 'of their candidate, and inkdieg soeme smow- obsorvations tpon what he caltedtho 'Imserableoprevarieations" of Dr. M'*Hale in bis exmination.

In=cncldZing a long and forcible address Mr. On'Malley reminded the committee that it was now for the nfirst time in the power of a tribunal like that which he was addressing to vindicate the freedom of election in Ireland by curbing the arrogance of the '!Loman Catholic priesthood of that country.. If, however, they merely useated Mr. loore, wvithout declaring Colonel Higgins duly elected, they would only enable the priests to return antemmbri -Mr. Mooreb place. nother member In WVhen the learned counsel had concluded his address, The committee adljourned until 1 'clock tids day, when they wll deliberate upoon their decision, LAMBETH. The committee reassembled at 12 o'clock yesterday. A witness named a)iokley, who had been employed cs a Canvasser for Mr. Roupel at 7s. 6d. a day, nd Sd. an hout over-time, proverl that Mr. aoupell, adooinpanied by Mturphy and Doulton, had gone to the Surey Canal Tavern and directed that more publchouses should be opened in the district. Two more were accordingly opened. TEhe witness sad he had not been paid for his labour a farthing more than it was honestly worth. Mr. Thomas Morris, a mathematical instrument maker, stated that he -had voted for Mr. Roupell, and acted aM chairman of a district committee at the Beehive Tavern, Walworth. The deputy chairman of the committee was Mr. Whitley, and it had six other members, aU of whom 'were voters. For three or foar dayB he received 15s. aay, but was afterwards cut down to lOs. The other committee. men were paid, and there were also six paid messengers and clerks. 1xe believed that the Duke of Suffolk, in Brandon. street; bhe Canterbury Arms, Kennington * the St. Paul's Walworth-common, the Joly Sailors, and the Queen's ead were al open as committee-rooms or placarding houses. On cross-eamination he said that the p4y-sheets were sent in to the central committee every Thursday. Ho appointed some of tho canva;sers, sad the question -whether or not they were voters was not taken into consideration in their appointment. Whether they .were voters or not they were certainly not over-paid for the services they rendered. They secured the most active men they could Re-examined.-The committeemen looked after the papers andbooks, and conducted the general business of the election, btb they were canvassers as welL There were about 800 voters in his district. There were other com. mnittee.rooms-perhaps five-in the district. They had books to teU what portions of the districteach of them vwa to take. By the CO,iDMITTE.-The 800 voters were within the dis. triect of his committee, and would not be canvassed by any of the other committees. Mr. W. Buckland, an estate agent and colector of the rents of some hundred tenants in CamberweU and Wal,worth, said he was ohairman of the committee at the Duke of Suffolk, in Walwortb. There werel4 committeemen and eight or nine paid canvassers. His district compri&ed 2,000 'voters. The committeemen were not paid, and the canvassers had lOs. a-day. He charged 10514 for his services, of which he had received 771., and he hoped to have his claim for the balance satisfied. A few days before the eleetion Mr. Willdnson's party offered him 601. to split his votes be. tween Roupell and Wilkdnson, but the matter was too far none for that, they were. all so fond of Mr. RoupeU (laughter), and he did not accept the proposition. Almost al the voters he canvassed plumped for Mr. Roupel. 281. had been struck off his account, and although he at one time expected to be paid he would now give it all up. ge vas out of pocket by the election. On cross-examination the witness said that the offer of EOl. was made by a Mr. Howoll, and it passed off as a joke. NWothing to drink was allowed in his committee-room, wvhich So disgusted the members that they signed a round robin to the central committee as4 aRowanco of drink, caion. (Laughter.) Mr. Manning, a surgeon, who had been employed to ascertain the relative. positions- of certain publichouses in the borough, gave evidence as to some which had been employ ad =s commiittee.rooms by Mr. Roupell-being at a very short distance from eaLch other.gatavrsht Mr. Truman, 'who had acted under Mir. Barton, stated that he was present at the general committee when it was decided that the publichouses should be opened. He had signed cheaks in conjunction with the treasurer. On the 16th of Miarch he signed a check for 1,0001., on the 20th one for 1,0004, onuthe 27th one for 1,2721., and on the 2d of April one for 1,4001., making, with an entrv of cash drawn from the bank oa the 6th of April, a total of 4,8221., of which there was a small balance remaining at the end of the election. He signed 44 or 45 pay-sheets, but could not telU the number of puLblichouses or beershops 'which had been engaged as placarding houses. There ni ght hae been dozen, but he certaini had not paid 50. EHo believed the word ' canvaSscr" ha been substituted for " chairman" on the pav-sheets, because the central committee only acknow. ldged and engaged them as canvassers. In every case they refused to acknowledge paid committeemen. Not a single committeeman was paid as a committeeman. They were only paid as canvassers. The word "chlairman" might have -to any one as chairmpan. S3omte ouft 44housets were houses of cal, where there was a respectable man as clerk to receive the canvassers and pay the money. re- The commaittee adjourned at 4 o'cock until this dav. BATH. The committee was occupied wiith tho scrutiny the whole of yesterday. A Dumbear of votes on both sides were struck off; and on thc adjournment of the committee the sitting member and the petitioner had an equal number of GALWAY (TOWN). At the sitting of the committee yesterday, Mr. E. JASIF$, on the part of the sitting member, applied to be allowed to examine a witness named Rochefort with respect to tho disposal of the 501. given to Oliver. The CosMAIrXTTr granted the application, and Mr. Paul Rochefort, an attorney, was accordingly exa3mined. Hie stated that out of tthe 501. received by Olivor 151. was paid for a tally-room, and the remainder handed over to him. He had paid 231. of the balance for assessors' fees, and with the remainder he had defrayed various expenses. ln cross-examination he said that his fec for the business of the election was 1001., but he had not been paid. lIe could not say the exact time when Oliver handed him the c5l., the balance of the 501.; but he believed it was since the petition had been presented. By the COWINzITTEf.-H-o had selected the room and engagea the street agents. Oliver was with him, but Oliver was not an agent. AMr. O'Flaherty had told him that he vas to draw upon the 50L in Oliver's hands. Mr. E. JAMns then addressed the oommittee on behalf of Mr. O'Flahorty. The material question he said was whother Mr. O'Flaherty must be held regponsible for the acts -of his so-called agents. The committee would probably come to the conclusion that Brown and Oliver had been guilty of bribery; that some indiscreet nersons had bribed some of the freeholders f bet they had ben told by *iIr. 4J'Flazhert.y thathe knew nothingof-the practicesofthese per. sons until he heard the evidence given before theconnmittee' and their acts, therefore, ceght not to affect the validity of his return. The petition, he said, had been got up not by the defeated candidate, but by an attorney's clerk, who knew that Mr. O'Flaherty's means had been crippled by an act of generosity, and who sought to take advantage of the circumstance that Mr. O'Flaherty had been obliged, in consequence of the rumours that had been circulated to his rejudioe, to place money in the hands of certain persons for the purpose of defraying the legitimate expenses of the election, by making out those persons to bo his agents. He did not deny that acts of bribery had been coiumitted, but lie denied that Mr. O'Flaherty had been in any way conmected with the persons who had committed them. Mr. Wo0BDSN oB'x then replied upon the whole case, con. tendiag that Mr.O'Flahertyhad admitted sufsicient coniuniD eation respecting the election wzith Brovwn and Oliver to render him responsible 'or the bribery of which they had nndoubtedly bcen Reilty. Hcalso submitted that Mr. O'Flaherty bad violated the Act by depositing money on ,.ccount of the eleotion with others than the election At the conclusion of the learned counsel's address the committee deliberated ior sabout half an hour, and The CsrsInrmav then announced that they hiad agreed to the following res;olttions *- That Authony 07iaberty, Eq., was not duly eec-ted a buiroesa toserve in tike present earliament for the county of the town of Galway.

EDNIUND'S. yesterd-ay. 4ttee reassembled at half.jspt 11. o'clock Mr a'^Wrs opened the case on behalf of the sitting oiT.,i and called the following evidence iti contradiction °. ease of the petitioner *- 4vnuel Wilson, a baker, stated that At the last election *9 CuUumm owved him 201. for bread, ana he had applied to. !them for payment; that 4e had bcean tac, both by CuUUlm and his wnfe, that Culiumn intended be get rnoney for his vote, and that they had asked hlm'tz, wait for the settle. ment of his account autff them elect'isn was over. He also said that he had not canvassed thol0allums for Mr. Hardcastle, And denied tbat he bad ecr offered Mrs. Culin 101. off the book, and lMQ to go'.an wvith Jf her husbaaz would vote for Hsrdcastk.r Oa cross-examination he said that he had been can. vassd by Messr. Harheastle 'and Collins; that since the election the Cvilums had paid some of the money they owed him, but that they wereotill in his debt. Mr. J. S. Barnee, a solicitor-of Colchester, and clerk of the'peacefor the %eough, staled that James had called at his ofce and told him thct he had been served with a Speakers vTran{tto give evidence before the cosiiudttee, but that oe would go to Mauchester and get ontof thoeway if he had the means. Re also asked if he would be obliged to obey the warrant unless some money was given him. 'Witness told himthat when he was served with a notificationof the time when be would be required to 4;weevidence he would have enough money given bims to take him to London. Jfames also said that he had recently lost his wife, that'howas out of employment, andthat, ha-lngdone all he could to secure Mr. Hardcastle's return, he thought hoihadhbeen hardly used by the party. In consequenceoof that statement witnezs gave him 2b. e denied that he bad ever offered Braybrook 151. to vote for Elardcastle, but admitted that he had received letters from Bray. brook asking for money. On being questioned in crossexamination with respect to theelectionof 1852, he said that lIr. Oakes was returned upon that occasion by a majority of eight, becanso Mr. Hardcastle refused to buy votes. Mr. Hardeastle, the sitting member, was next examined. He said that many of his ancestors had lived at Bury, that he was educated there, and that he had relatives residing there. At the last election there was what was called a cemmi-tee-room, but he had no committee. His agent was Mr. Collins. He had personally canvassed nxarly every voter in the borough. Mr. Le Grice generally accompanied him in hiscanvass, but no one was authorized to act for him except Mr. Collins. He did not remember that J. N. Clark ever canvassed for him;i certainly he had no authority to act for him, or to pay a single shilling upon his account. He had never directly or indirectly authorized Mr. Burroughes to give any entertainment at theFox. He hadbeardMr. Burroughesintended to do something of the sort, and he had gone, and told him, but he insisted on its not being done, as it might endanger his election. At the time of the nomination he felt suro of a majority of upwards of 50. The number he had calculated to poll was 319, and the number he actually polled was 320. He had not sanctioned the employment of any band after the election. Mr. 'Clark had promised him his vote nine months before the election, He had given 1t. to Mrs. James as an act of pure charity,, having first ascertamed that she was not the wife of a voter. He knew nothing whatever about the witness James. He had no authority to act on his ,iehalf. He denied that Joseph Braybrook had said in hig Presence that he would not vote until the affair of the last election was settled, or anything to that effect. On cross-examination Mr. Hardeastle said that he coinmenced his canvaes about a month before the election, said that, although there was no committeeformed, several persons interested in his retarn frequented what was called the com, mittee-room. Hisagentforthe paymentof electionexpenses was Mr. Leech. He had givenMr. Leech 301. or40t. daring the election and 501. since. He had notyet paid the romainder of the election qxpenses. He had never canvassed with J. N. Clark. He gave Clark the sovereign for Mrs. James becaupe he asked for it. At the interview he had with James after he had left church on Sunday, the 21st of June, James asked him for money to get out of the way. Ie replied that he could not give him a farthing; and if the Speaker's warrant had been served on him ho must go up and speak the truth. James said that if he did not have money to go out of the way he would unseat him. Burroughes had:sent in no bill on account of the entertainment at the Fex and if he did he would not pay it. There was about 1201. of the election expenses still unpaid. Its non-payment hid nothing whatever to do with the presentatoi of this petition.' In re-examination Mr. Hardeastle said, that James also said at the interview he had mentioned that if hp pleased he mightlive like a prince at Newton-court, the residence of Mr. Oakes. All the messengers who were paid were-fully employed; no one was paid for doing nothing. MIr. Le Grice was next examined, and stated that in his opinion a change had-taken place in political opin'ions at Bury in favour of the Liberal party sinco a number of. hew voters had been placed on the register. The constitiency consisted of 700 or 800 voters. James's account of hii conversationwith witness was untrue. Mr. Thomas Collins, a solicitor and reglstrar ofthe County Court, who had acted as the agent of Mr. Hardcastle in the management of the last election, stated that since 1852 there had been 183 new voters placed on the register, of whom 90 had voted for Mr. Hardeastle and 60 - for Mr. Oakes. With regard to the general conduct of the election Mr. Collins f uly corroborated the statements of Mr. Hardeastle. With regard to the sovereffv by Mr. Eardcastle to woman was nearly dying for want-of assistance Ar. fard. castle had asked hin if there was any harm in ivinn a a sovereign before handing It over. The ringers had applied to him for payment, but he told them that he was not the agent for election expenses. He never authorized James, or Burroughes, or Clark to spend a single shilling. He had forbidden the band to play. On cross-examination he said that 37 messengers were, in his opinion, necessary for the purposes of the election. If it hbeean left altogether to him he should have appointed that number. By the ConrITTsE.-James was very Indignant when he came to be paid at being offered only a sovereign. He had been employed four days, and witness thought 5s. a- day sufflicient payment. Others had objected in the same way. They had been better paid at previous elections. Mir. HAnivTs then gummed up on the part of the sitting member, contending that the election was most properly and economically conducted, and that none of the allega. tions in the petition had been proved. The Committee then adjourned until this day.

HI$ ROYA1fi HlaYBSSSTHP=VCZ0,FPBUSSIA. Yesterday one. uf those formal ceremonies which still maintain th pestige of our ancient corporation and malir its nominal privileges as much areward and distinction as the Cross tbf the 1Bath or the Itegon of Honour took piWce inl b l' isall. The fxeedom of the City of Loh4o4 with allthe igfts, whichhe is never likely to exercise, andiaM_ munitles, which he will at claim, was conferred upon Prnce Frederiok. Wfilliam of Prussia, with the higE state and ceremonial usual upon such occasions. Though thO p'oeecdlngs are always or a routine and form'al character, like in nearly every case, yet the ceremony of conferring the freedom of the city Is generaUy regarded with deep injerest, less due to the formality itself than to the illustrious or distinguished indinidual oi whom the honour is bestowed. Yesterday considerable interest was evinced, for all were anxious to behold Eer Majesty's intended son in-law-the Prince to whose care is confided the future happiness of one of the most universaUy boloved members of the Royal family. The old Guildhall looked well on this occasion Though the interior always suggests the most anfavourable comparisons between it and the Hotels de Vile of France or Bruzsels;though its aycbiteoturaldetailsaye mean,whimsical, and bizarre; and though, as a building, it is in every way unworthy the great renown of the corporation of London for wealth and magnificence, yet on these occasions it generally presents a suggestiave and impressive sight. One cannotlook with indifferonce upon an assemblage of all the great merchants and traders of London. Even if it took place in a bars, the locale would acquire respectable proportions from the idea that it contained the men who farm the products of the world, and whose financial edicts are spread abroad from pole to pole and everywhere received as lawr. So far, too, the hard plainness of the Gul&dhal appears to consort well with their work-day life, ana to be like the merchants themselves in stone-a collection of hard and useful facts. Considerable attempt, were made yesterday to give the interior of the halUarich andtasteful aspect, andthrough the actual structure of the building. marred much of this, yet the city architect had done very well, and upon the whole it was briliant and striking. Fags of all nations weresuspendedfromthegreat cornices,andinthe centreof the eastern window was a large and bold medallion of Her lajesty, with golden lions for supporters; surrounded with wreaths and'flags, and at the sides of the galeries were heraldic shields of the principal nations. In the centre of the western window was a fine trophy of flags, and the several compartments on each side of the hail were similarly decorated, with the addition of floral, wreaths. At the end of the hall, immediately below the ladies' gallery, was the seat for the Lord Mayor, on the right of which a state chair of gold and crimson velvet was placed for the Prince of Prussixi and a similar one on the left of his Lordship for the Duke of Cambridee. Below these on either side were the seats for the aldiceen and distinguished guests. All the lobbies and passages leading from the hall to the Council Chamber were decorated with trophies of flags and wreaths, so that the eye foll everywhere on a profusion of colour and ornament, which had a most pleasing effect. The seats allotted to visitors and the various members of the corporation were flUed at least an hour before the time fixed for the ceremony, and the bright dresses of the ladies, mixed with uniforms and civic gowns of office, imparted a still more brilliant appearance to the old hall. The American Minister was the earliest visitor of distinction, but he waS soon followed by the ambassadors of all the principal foreign Courts, among whose briliant uniforms and badges of offlce the plain black dress of the Transatlantic representative seemed quite obscured. The Turkish Minister, accompanied by Madame Musurus, was loudly cheered, as were aiso the French Ambassador, the Sardinian Minister, the Prussian Minister, and the Countess Betustorff. Among the other members of the corps di,plomatique were the Greek Minister and Madame Tricoupi, the Belgian Minister and Madame Van de Weyar, tho Netherlands Minister, the Saxony Minister, and the Austrian Minister and Countess Apponyi The Duke and Duchess of Argel, ths Marquis of Breadalbane, the Earl of Clarendon, Earl Granville, the Earl of Harrowby, and Sir George Grey were also present, and nearly all in levee dress, wearing the ribands and stars of the various ordera to which they belonged. The Lord .dayor met with a most flattering reception as he walked up the hall, but the Duke of Cambridga was the most favoured in this respect. His appearance was welcomed with enthusiastic applause, which continued for some minutes, and was second only to that which greeted the arrival of the Prince of Prussia. One o'clock was the time fixed for the ceremony, and precisely at five minutes to that hour the Prince alighted at the entrance to the hall. His Eighness was accompanied by Count Moltke, General Sir Frederick Stovin, and Captain the Hon. Dadley do Boa. The Prince was zeceived by a deputation consisting of foar of the senior aldermen present, the select committee appointed to. make the arrangements, and the mover and seconder of the resolution for presenting the freedom. He was conducted by thisdeputation to the Court of Aldermen, where the Lord Mayor, the foreign Ministers, and most distinguished gaests were waiting to receive him. After the leading officers of the corporation had beon duly presented, a procession was formed to the hail in the following oraer;- The Sunlor City marshsA The Mover and Seconder Chairman of City Lands eombera of Select Committee UnderdherLffs Solcitor Rmembrancer CJutroler Seoundaay Judge of the Sheriff Courts Common SerJeant Town Clerk Chamberlain Sheriff (attended by their Chaplains) Aldermen below the Chair Recorder Aldermen above the Chair Senior Puarhal Lord Mayore's Household Lord Mao's Chaplain tmace Bsrer Sword Bearer The LORD MAYOR Hi Royal Highness Prince FBEDERICK WILLIM of PRUSSIA And His Royal HIghness the Duke of CAMBRIDGE. The foreign Ministers, officers of state, and the suite in attendance upon the Prince closed the procession. As his Highness entered the ha3l he was received with continued cheers, clapping of hands, and waving of handkerchiefs from every part of the building. He seemed muchgratifled at the warmth of feeling evinced towards him, and often stopped to bow his acknowledgments. Prince Frederick took his seat on the right hand of the Lord Mayor, the Prussiau Minister being seated next to him. The chairs on the left of his Lordship were occupled by the Duke of Camabridge and the French and Tarkish Ministers. The freedom of the city, we believe, can only be conferred t a Court of Common Council, and such in strictness was the court which assembled yesterday at Gauildhal3. It was necessary, therefore, that the minutes of the previous court should be read and approved, whichwasaccordinglydonebytheclerk at the table. Thnisformalityoccupiedafewminutes,duringwhich his Royl Highness and the assembled Ministers acquired a sglghlt sowledge of the constitution of the Court of Aldermen, with certain additional facts as to the progress which had been made towards converting Smithfield into a dead mneat market, and that a committee had been appointed to Krepare plans and estimates of the same. These interesting aetails, atwhich few could forbear to smile as theywere read aloud with solemn gravity in the midst of such a briliant scene, having been gone through, the look of expectation eeemed to settle over all the numerous audience. Sir John Key, the Chamberlain of the city, then rose, and in a clear voice, which was distinctly audible throughout the hall, addressed the Prince as follows:- "Prince Frederick William,-Sir, as the representative of that ancient corporation in whose hail we are now assembled, it becomes myprivilege to tenderfor your Royal Highness's acceptance a distinction which, though deserving to ho set forth with all the advantages of human eloquence, has happily a dignity of its own as much beyond any powers of mine to magnify as it is beyond any deficiency of mine to diminish or impair. To you, iUustriousSir, who have shown such interest in a country with which, next to your own, will henceforth be intertwined the nearest ties and destinies of your social being, I need hardly say that the freedom of this city is a great national institution, an institution which reflects back upon the great, and wise, and good whom itadmits into itabrotherhoodahl thegloryof their own name and deeds-upon the brave, the lustre of their triumphs; upon the learned, the honour of their discoveries; upon the philanthropist, the light of his own good works; upon the'noble, the high-born, and the iUustrious, the greatness of their forefathers' achievements and the Imperosableness of the ancestral name. (Hear, hear.) On this last ground, Sir, even if there had been no other, this Court had been abundantly justified in singling out your Royal Highness for the present distinction. We may not forget that the guest whom our Queen has delighted to honour comes of the time-honoured house of Brandenburg, is descended of a distinguished line of princes, be nmnig with one on whom the suffrages of contemporaneous istory bestowed the name of " Great," and brought down to the times of one who has everything of Rreatness but the namoe. Yes, Sir, w-o aroe n-ot--2ig-nora-nt how-- grtenlt your ea, as well as to those of your fellow-subjects at home, will be any exppassions of respect which this Court may offer to him who now fills the throneof your ancestors. If, owing to his lot having been cast upon more settled and peaceful times, be has not exhibited those extraordinary and commanding qualties which distinguished the founder of his dynasty, or if he Can point to fewer of those military trophies by which the immediate successors of that great man first raised the electorate to a kingdom, and then consoldated and enlarged its powor, yet are there qualities in your Royal relative which, in this country at least, place higher in the rank of potentates than any of his pre decessors7-qualities which, more than that genius which laid the foundation of your nation's greatness, more than those conquests which enlarged its territorial rule, mora than that vigorous intellect which, if it dazzled the teopla by its brillancy, dazzled only to leadastray, entitle him t the love of his subjects and to the moralesteem of mankind For, Sir, I need scarcely remind you that we are a peaceloving nation. Renowned as we are in the rougli strife of war and always ready for it, yet it is our nobler boast to occupy the advancoed post of European civilization; to b- the herald, everywhere of social and moral progress; to hail as brother every potentate and every man who has at heart the interests of suffering humanity and the -case of puri and undefiled relgion. Andsuchan one, illustrious Prtnce, we seeinxyour Royal kinsman. He hasstrengthened ths bonds of our political alliance by visiting and sojourninr among us, by studying .the bent and bias of our national sympathis, by throwing himuself into our benevolent plans ior amelioratingthe condition of the prisoner and the outcast, and by consenting to go hand in hand with us in a new bloodless crusade, whereby, under the auspices of a Pro- 1 testant Episcopate, the lands of the Redeemer might be .evangolize4 sns lt e hildxon of the dlspericd bg gat!ierel ina Reason enough, however, as there would seem to be in tlese e Crcas4c1ites for kndering to your Royal Highness tbis municipsl-token of respect, it is not to be concealed that we are moved thereto by considerations of a higher, closer, and even more sacred kind,- (E{ear, hear.) Yon are about to contract a relation with this country which will henceforth make you as one of us. You are on the point of being entrusted by the people of this nation. with one of their most cherished and deeply prized possessiona. You are about to have be-towed upon yoa the hand of England's daughter, because the first-born of England's: Queen. (Cheers ) Yes, Sir, I nothing doubt you aro aware that your approaching marriage has become in the bighest sense a nation's matter-that in anxiety for the. future fortunes of the Royal offspring the peoplo's heart in this country and the monarch's heart beat together; in a word, so bound ap are our country's happiness and our country's good with the Sovereign that reigns over us, that not only do we acknowledge that whatever is ours is hers, but that, so far asl loyal love and sympathy can make it so, whatever is hers is ours. (Loud cheers.) Indeed, Sir, loyalty with us is no mere sentiment. It is A principle-a nationality-as much a part of the British character as the fidelity which never forsakes a friend or the courage which never feared a foe. And if upon this aboriginal and instinctive loyalty of. our people you sup. pose to be engrafted all that affection which is inspired to. wards our beloved Queen by an. unaurpased combination of personal qualities-by wisdom, by moderation, by a heart ihat feels for the mtanest of her subjects-by all that could make a throne glorious, a people happy, a Court virtuous, a palace bright with pictures of domestic joy and peace, you can well understand with what feelings of emotion we contemplate the separation from us of an illastrious Princess, and hov earnestly we pray that she may find in the country of her adoption the virtues of an BD&lish Court and the happiness of an English home. (Cheers.) Of ;our Royal Highness personally I feel it would ill become me to speak. If I am rightly informed of the Eentiments entertained towards you by your own country. 3meu, of their respect for those morad and intellectual qualities by which your life has hitherto been distinguished, they are as incredulous of there being a Princess worthy to be honoured with your affection as we are of any Prince being found worthy of the daughter of our unrivalled Queen. In this reciprocated persuasion of the two nations, therefore, that each is offeriDg of its best to cement ancient ties, to strengthen the bulwarks of the Protestant faith, to hasten the reign of a worldwide brotherhood and peace, our country bids you God speed, and this Court tenders to you this expre-sion of its homage. (Chees). Whether, Sir, in the Providential orderings of EHim by whom Kings reign and Princes decree justito it may ever be yours to ascend the throne of your ancestors we know not; but, should such be His will, I feel that in the name of this Court and of our common country I can express for you no higher or better wish than that, as much as our Monarch does, you may enjoy the affections of your subjects and have history to tesify of you when you die that you as much deserved I them. (Londeheering.) The Chamberlain then advanced and presented the formal document of the Freedom of the City, enclosed in the usual handsome box of sohd gold. His RoYAi HIGHNESS the PRLXCZ replied as follows, speaking in a powerful emphatic tone of voice that made every word distinct to the furthest spectators:Ithank 3ou very sincerely for the kind sentiments which you have uttered towards my Sovereign, my country, and myself. These feelings will be appreciated, I feel certain, by them no less than by me. It has given me the greatest satisfaction to receive from the hands of the municipal authorities of this ancient city an honour which [ must ever highly prize; and I acknowledge in the distinction so conferred upon mean additional token of the kindly feelings evinced towards me by the British people. I trust that. the confidence which they are willing to repose in me will not be unmerited, and that tho future happiness of the Princess-my affianced bride-may prove equal to my endeavours to secure it, and to the devoted and hearty attachment which [bear to the Queen, your Sovsreign. (Applause.) Allow me oncemore to thank you with all my heart for the cordiality of your welcome, and to assure youL of my most fervent wishes for the welfare and the prosperity of the city of London. (Continued cheering.) At the conclusion of the reply, it was proposed by Mr. Alderman CorELA.ND, and seconded by Mr. J. VALLAIACFX that the proceedings of the Court, with the Prince's gracious answer, be entered upon the minutes, which was carried W2m. con. His Royal HIghness then, accompanied by the Duko of I Cambridge, retired, amid the same hearty acclamations which bad greeted his arrival, andproceeded to theMarnsionhouse, where a collation was provided for his Highness and the principal guests.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. nlr,--wrnen I adaressed a letzer to you some few days ago I had not seen Lord Ellenborough's speech, as reported on the 30th of June; and I must beg again to trespass on your indulgence, for I see that a brother of ColonelJones, of the 60th Rifles, has written, with a very kindred feeling to my own, respectingwhat hemildlycallsan "ungenerous" attRac on the officers in command of Her Majesty's forces at Meerut. We, of the family of " Brown, Jones, and Robinson," are fully aware that the only mode of coTn. bating such assertions, insued ex caOiedr&, is by an appeal to The Times, and for this reason I trouble you again. IIn reading your report, dated June 30th, of the proceedings of the House of Lords, I see that " the mutineers roso at 6 p.m., and it was not until nightfall that Her Majesty's Carabineers were able to move ;" and again, " who was in command of the troops at Meerat? His name is Hewitt. I do not find that he has at any time served with troops at all. He is anunkisownman." Seospeech of Lord Ellenborough. Now, Sir, I hope that I speak with due reverence, but I am much reminded of a friend of my own, who while at the University gained a gold medal for an English poem (which, by the by, he had not written himself), but who never recovered from the effects of his success. The spirit of poetry was upon him. He talked in stanzas, he slept witn melody, and I trust when he diesthat he wil livein an epic. So it is with the Earl of EUenborough. He has been a Governor-General in India, and the infallible jaud ment of a Governor-General would appear to be still visible in everything, even with regard to the proper time for turning out a corporal's guard This judgment has now been exerted to crush some absent officers, and it appears to have been formed upon the opinion expressed by a medical officer who had just had to rde for his life and who naturally may be supposed to have thought every minute in turning out to have been an hour of delay. The inference from the first paragraph I have quoted is that it took a most unwarrantable time to turn out. There must have been slackness somewhere. according to this dictum. Now, the medical officer says that the Colonel was hurrying out the troops. When I ray that every soldier of the Carabineers would turn out " double quick`' -with the prospect of a fray, I beheve that I speakeorrectly but I may also add that they would turn out quicker, if possible, to please theircommanding officer. At Eupatoria, when the regiment was under canvass during the winter for some six weeks on the seashore, I know that Colonel Jones, whether sick or well, naver left his regiment ; he visited himself nightly the sentries of his camp between midnight and daybreak, and for some tinie sbared the same tent with a sickly soldier-servant. These, of course, are vulgar traits, but they are traits which the soldier. appreciates, and when Colonel Jones joined his regiment unexpectedly on the line of march a few months o (I believe at Cawnpore) the men started out from theirlines on purpose to cheer him. As it was with the thermometer very often at night from 6 deg. to 16 deg. below freezing point on the sands at Eupatoria, so will it be, in my sure belief, under a tropical sun. Colonel Jones will never leave his regiment while able to sit on his horse, and his men will follow him wherever he leads. However, Lord Ellenborough, wishing to show his know. ledge of Jomini, the Great Mogul, and of everything else whether civil, minitary, or tropical, must needs slay this officer's fair. fame in a line. With regard +o General Hewitt, Lord Ellenborough says that he is an "unknown man." He certainly may not have bad the luck to have been in a general action, and lie is not a KO.B., although that decoration has covered many a dubious breast; but, according to all that is known ohgm,.he h to feel for his meuey in the dark The 60th Res first found their game, and the troops were thon collected, and attacked in combined artistical form. What mnore could he do that we know at present ? Advanco to Delhi? Feeling as I do the full importance of a crash of. English cavalry at the proper time, wi only quote the despatches of the Duke of Wellington, who reminded one officer that the days were gone by when Madrid oould be taken by a charge of cavalry ! I think that the Catabi. neers, half mounted as I believe them to be, would have cit a very sorry figure on the following morning if they had foundon theirreturntheir own campnin flames. However, General Hewitt has assed 40 years in stationis :m camrp (perhaps not in courts?, where he has seen large bodies o troops collected and move together. With one. fortieth part of that service under certain contingencies of connexion, he would have been considered fit for any commnand In the world; and it is the opinon of most people that solemn platitudes without evidence, which rumi the reputation of an absent officer, are hardly generous; and, worst of all, that they bring no credit to members ef the Legislature who choose to indulge in them. The officers in India, who are now using the best energies of head and hand in th hbattle-field and under a scorching sun, will hb agreeably surprised when they shaU hear thbt they have already been condemned at home for incompe. tence, eveni before there has been one tittle of evidence adduced against them.

IBELAND. (BY B.rnro AN =RNAT soNAI TZ:czGnAr.) DUBLIN, MONDAY EV72N'oG. THE MRDER OF MR. L .'- The adjourned investigation took place at Capelstreet offioe to-day. Some new evidenoe was adduced, the most important being that given by Joseph Spollen, the econd sonof the accused, a boy u-der 14 years of age, and which wasc onsidered to have strengthened the cise for the prosecution so far as being corroborative of the main parts of the 'testimony given by Lucy Spoflen, the daughter of the prisoner. James Spollen, the eldest son, was also examined, but his evidencoe was-not considered to be very material. At 6 o'clock the case was brought to a conclusion, when it was at~ranged that the prisoner was to b remanded, when the now informations will be iead over and the formal application made to commit Spollenon the charge of wilful murder. Mr. Fitzgibbon, Q.C., conducted the case to-day for the Crown.
