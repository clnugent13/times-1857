ELECOTION COMMITTEES. IPBWICH w-ne irst witness examined on Saturday was Walter CowelL-He said that on the afternoon of the Polling day be was looling at the list in &Xr. Adair's central comaittee-room, when Mr. Head gave him an order for 501n to take to the bank. He took It, and brought hack 501. in gold in a bag to Mr. Head. This was a little before 3. On cross-examination he said there was no concealment about what ho did. He gave the bag to Mr. Bea Openly in the presence of several people. There was no mystery in the matter, and he was nottold to say nothing aboutit. Mir. Head did not saywhether it was to pay travelling expenses. Walter Mulley said, he was the son of Charles Cooper Mulley, and acted as ward clerk during the election at tho St. Margaret's committee-room. Between 12 and I on the Iling day he was at the central committee-room. To the ost of his belief no money was paid to any one during the election. He denied that he had a large sum of money about him on the day of the election. Neither his father nor any other person handed money to him on that day. Cross-examined.-There was no truth iD the statement that he received a bag of money from the hank on that day. John Gattrell said that on the polling.day a voter named Vinier came up to the booth, and said he would vote for Marshman, Se'vin, and Adair. Upon being told that he could onlyvote for two of the candidates, and asked which of them he would choose, he said, "1Stop a; hit ; let me see if the money is right." He then went away, and witness saw bim speak to some one at the gateway of the Waggon and Horses. He came back in two or three minutes, and voted for Adair and Marshman. Cross-exanined.-Witness was at the tooth as an inspector on the Conservative aide. The man had been drinking, but he was not drunk. When he canme bick the clerk at first reftused to receive his vote, but it was at last entered under protest. Jeremiah Osborne said, ho had seen Vinier speak to Cook, the plumber, at the Waggon and Horses ou the day of the election. He had also seen Freke and Alfred Osborne taking some beer together, and then go to the polL Mr. D. J. Bristow, one of the petition4rs, said, he had taken an active part in the election on behalf of Mr. Cebbold, and Mr. Selwin. After the election a man named Hadley, a returned convict, had spokeni to him about a voter named Abbot. He had made some payments to some of the witnesses in support of the petition, but he had neyer paid money to any one to induce him to give evidenco. Cros3-examined.-He had given money to Barber-three sums of 5s. each, in consequence of his being ill. He had not given him money before the election. larber refused to make a statement until something was given to him. He had been informed that Barber wanted to make a statement. He told Barber that if he expected to get money from him for making a statement he would be disappointed. Hadley, who was present, said he would mike it all right, and Barber then made a statemene, which was written down, and which he signed. Witness afterwards heard that Barber had received 21. for making the statement. Barber did not refuse to sign the statement until he had received a sovereign, and Hadley did not promise hiea a sovereign if he would sign it. He was the Mr. Bristow illuded to inthe minutes of a former Ipswich committee as having bribed a voter with 30a. Re-examined.-He had no transactions whatever with Hadley. He had been applied to by Hadley for money, but had refused to give it hinm. Ile had not paid any one for giving evidence. John Reed, the landlord of the Postchaise, said, that Charles Mulley had engaged committee-rooms at his house for Adair and Marshman at lLa-day. He dbeen paid for them by Mr. Adair. Tickets had been issued for beer and gin for the messengers, but not for voters. ne had not y-t made out his bill for the refreshments. Mr. Adair did not owe him a farthing. Cross.examined.-He said before the election that he would give no trust, and he kept his word. No voter had any hquor at his house without paying for it. Mr. Samuel Mullett, the manager of the brewery of Messrs. Cuthbert and Sedgwick, said, that they had about 30 publichouses and beerhouses in Ipswich, and that he had canvassed at those houses for Adair and Marshman, and reported the result of his canvass every day to Messrs. Iuley and Bedford at the central committee-room. On the evenving of the nomination day he saw MIr. Adair, and told him he would find some voters at Brooker's the next morning. Brooker kept a beerhouse, where he had heard there was to bea breakfast. On cross-examination, he said he was sure it was Mr. Adair to whom he had spoken. He had a white hat on, (Laughter.) Robert Scarce, a man in the employment of J. Smith, the tailor, at the last election, said, that when he asked his master for a job his master sent him to the central committee in Qneen-street, and he was engaged as a messenger at 7s. 6d. a-day.I A cab proprietor named Mead stated that his cabs had been engaged for Adair and lOarshman by J. Smith the lailor. He was paid for them by Head. Mr. C. Burton, the election auditor, said, that Messrs. Cobbold and Selwin paid their expenses by checks upon their bankers. The expenses of the respective candidates were,-Adair and Miarhman, 4801. Cobbold and Selwin, 5361., exclusive of his fee. He had not paid any traveUing expenes Amariner named Street produced a letter offering, on the part of Messrs. Adair and Marabman, to;pay hia travelhing expenses to Ipswich, and saying he might vote for whom he thought proer. He wrent to Ipswich and voted for Cobbold-and Se win. The Committee adjourned until this day. YARMO7UTH. At the sitting of the committee on Saturday the following further evidence was given in support of the petition. George Woods, a publican, stated that -previous to the election Royal had come to him and said he understood that he (witness) woald like to be paid for his vote. On the morning of the polling day he was at the Queen's Head, where he saw Royal, who gave him 61. in gold. He thtn went to the pol and voted for the sitting members. He gave Drury 15s. out of the 61. On cross-examination, he said that he left Yarmouth on Thursday, and did not make this statement until his arrival in London. All the time he was subpcenaed he received 2, andyesterdayhohad receivedanother21. to send to his wife, as it was thought she might be required to give evidence. When he came to London he went to the Parliamentary agent, as he had been directed to do when he w's subpcenaed, and the Parliamentaryagent provided him with board and lodging. He had been about for his amusement since his arrival in London. He had been to Cremorne with Drury and other voters. Re-examined.-He was reluctant to come to London, and at first refused to make any statement. Willian Larke, a master cooper, and a non-voter, said, he knew George Chester, a voter, who worked at a shop next door to him. He remembered seeing Chester canvassed previous to the election by Mr. Livingstone and other gentlemen. On the evening before the election he directed Mr. Livingstone to Chester's workshop. When Mr. Livingstonenwent into the workshop he stood in a passage which led to it. The passage was on one side of the workshop; it was boarded and had chinks between the boards, and contained an old casement. While in the passage he heard Mr. Livingstone say, "I find, after inquiry, that it is quite right. It is a large sum for a poor mau to lose." He undersItood that Mir. Livingstone referred to an old debt of 141. owed to Chester. He heard Chester remark that he supposed ho shouldhave heard nothing about it if there had not been an election. After some further conversation, which he could not hear, Mr. Livingstone said, " If yoa doubt my word, come to me at half-past 6, and I wiU give you the money." He also said, " Now, will you vote for Mr. M'Cullagh ." Mr. Livingatone then went away, and at abouthalf-past6o'clock Chesterwentttowards his house. The next day he met Chester, and said, " You had a good haul last night. People are talking a great deal aboub it, and any one who received half as much as you did ought to have kept his mouth shut." Chester smiled, and said he could make a pretty good guess as to who had told the other party Cross-examined.-e had not told Chester that if he gave him 51. he would not say anything about it. Some time ago he was out of employment, and unable to keep up his payments under a County Court judgment. lie had been through the Insolvent Court, He had left Yarmouth and returned to it about three years ago. He had received no money except 21. with his subpoena. Mathew Henry Winder said, he kept an hotel at Yarmouth. He wastan elector, and had been canvassed by both parties at the Isat election, but he did not vote. On the onday after the election a dinner took place at his house. It was ordered by Mr. Brand on the previous evening There were 48 persons at the dinner, which cost 2sB 6d. da head, without wine, and about a bottle of wine to each person was drunk. Spiling, Steward, and Brand were present, and after the dinner a separate room was used by them for I the payment of money. He was born a Conservative, bau would not say what were his principles at present. Cross-examined.-He did not know whether it was a dinner to check clerks or not. Mr. SLADE showed the witness his name upon the list of persona alleged to have been bribed. The witness said, there was no pretence for saying that he was bribed. He did not vote, and he thought the dinner was ordered at his house for that reason. Thomas Image was caUed, but was objected tobgv the learned counsel for the sitting member on the ground that he had been present in the committee.room during aportion of the inquiry. It appeared from the evidence of another witness named Farrow, and of Image bimself, who was examined by the Chairman, that Image had on the previous day entered the room for the purpose, as he said, of knowing how he should answer questions whenz he was called upon to give evidence; he was not aware of any rule for the exclusion of witnesses. The Committee held that the witness could not be examined. John Gibbons, a dyer, and a non-voter, said, that at the time of the election he was employed as doorkeeper at the theatre; that on the evening before the election he was at the house of a hairdresser named Layton, who lived near thetheatre; that he then heard Chapman sayto Layton, "I will give you 101. for your vote," to which Layton replied, "All right ;" and that at about half-past 7 o'clock the next morning he saw Chapman come out of Layton's house. On cross-examination he said, he had made this statement to Mr. Cooper, who had told him to come and give evidence before the committee. It was then proposed on the part of the petitioner to call a witness to speak to another case, but the learned counsel for the sitting member objected to any fresh case being commenced before the case of Layton was closed. Any further witnesainsupport of that case would be able before Monday ato ascertain wbat evidence had already been given. The Cosarimnms however refused to lay down any general rale, but recommended the learned counsel tn close one case before another was commenced whenever it was possible. Charles Reeve, formerly a gentleman's servant, stated that he was a voter for the borough, and had been canvassed by both par4ies; that about a fortnight before the election Mr. Last offered him 50s. to vote for Mi'Cllagh and Watkin, but be-reft:sed; that Mr. Last afterwards offered him 5, which.he4gelAd, and that he then voted for MrCulagtr and s'a, .R;Jsfther stated tbA by the diuction Of Mr. last he had offered Harmer 5)s. for his vote, but that Harmer refused it. Cross-examined.-He received the 51. from Mr. Last, at Mr. Last's house, a fortnight or three weeks before the election. Mr. LIst gave hint a bauknote, and ho signed a piece of paper, as if he had borrowed the money. He now owed Mr. LMst 21., which he had borrowed since the election. He did not tell Mr. Last that he was hard up. He kept a lodginghouso before the election. He had money in a savings-bank at Norwich, and when he borrowed tbe 21. he said he would repay it the next time he went to Norwich. He had been served with a summons, and he had paid his own expenses to London, but he had been told that he should be repaid. He had never mentioned to any one that he had received 51. from Mr. Last, or that he had borrowed money from him. Thewitness was subjected to a severe cross-examinatloa by the CaAmM" as well as by Mr. RODWELL, with a view to elicit some information as to how his transaction with Mr. Isst had been discovered, but he persited in his statement that he hadnever mentioned it until his exaininationbefore the committee. The Committee then adjiurned. HUNTINGDON (COIUNTY). The committee appointed to inquire into the reburn for this county held its first sitting on Saturday. The chairinan is hEr. J. M. Cobbett. The other menmbers are Sir S. Johnstone, Mr. H. Paul, Mr. T. ML Weguelin, and Mr. W. W. Wynne. Three petitions have been presented in this case, but one of them, containing allegations of bribery and undue inf'. ence, has been withdrawn. One of the remaining two is signed by Mr. Fellowes; it complains of the improper re. ception and rejection of votes, and prays that the name of Mr. Heathcote may be erased from the return. and that of the petitioner substituted. The other is a cross-petition, presented by Mr. Heathcote, also complaining of the himproper reception and rejection of votes, and praying that the petitioner may be declared duly elected~ The counsel in snpport of the petition of Er. FelIowes are Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Cool-, ir. Field. and Mr. Hall the counsel for the second petition of Mr. Heathcote are Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Power, and Mr. RodwellL Mr. O'MAI,EY opened the case. He stated that at the last election there were three candidates for the represen. tation of the county-fMr. James Rust and Mr. d ward Fellowes, the old members, and M1r. John Moser Heathcote. The election took place on the 2d of April, and the result of the polling was-Rost, 1,192; Heathcote, 1,106; Feliowes, 1,106. Thus there was a double return, and the sheriff declared hIr. Rust and Mr. Heathcote' duly elected. The inguiry whether that was a correct decision would resolve itself into a scrutiny, sa, although at first each party had been accusod by their opponents of illegal practices, he bemeved that in fact no election hadever been conducted in a fairermannerthan thepresent. The scrutiny wouldinvolve somnequestions of law and some of fact, which might occupy considerable time in their investigation, but be and his learnedfriend would endeavour to save the committee as much trouble as possible. It had been agreed that both the petitions should be taken together. After the usual formal evidence had been gone, through A vote was strack off the listof Mr. Heathcote by coasent. Mr. E. JAMES said, the first voters to whose names he should object belonged to a class with regard to which a new question would be raised under the recent Act. These voters had, he should contend, been corruptly influenced by a system of treating sanctioned by Mr. Fellowes and his agents, and the question was whether upon a scrutiny such treating would be held to disqualify a voter. Some evidence wasthen called with regard to a breakfast given to some voters on the morning of the poll by Mr. Percevl, the alleged agent of Mr. Fellowes, but before the conclusion of the first case, The committee adjourned until this day. GLOCESTER (CITY). The committee prooeeded on Saturday with the hearing of evidence in support of the petition against Mr. Price's return. James Stock, a groom in the employment of Mr. Cool, the baker, staed that on the polling day a journeyman baker named King, also in Mr. Cook's employment, showed him five sovereigns, which he said he had received for ais Samuel King said that on the polling day he went with Jeremy, another journeyman baker, Gould, and Niblett, to the yellowcommittee-room, and, after obtaining a ticket there, went and voted for Berkeley and Price. Ee denied that he had received any money for his vote. He admitted that he had shown money to Stocl; and told him he had received it for his vote, but that was only " chaff." The money was his own; it was partly his savings and partly the remains of a legacy. On cross-examination he said that Masey had offered him 21. to vote for Sir R. Carden. He did not tell Smart that he would have 71. for his vote. John Smart, landlord of the Rampant Cat publichouse, said that on the morning before the election King told him he had not made up his mind how he should vote. On the day of the election King asked him what the figure was, but witness said he knew nothing about it, and he had better speak to some- one else. King then went away with some men, among whom was Gould. He saw Gould put his hand into his pocket and chink some money. The night before the election King said he should want 71. lOs. for his vote to pay half-a-year's rent. Thomas Snowsell said he knew Charles Webb, a voter. On the election day he askedWebbwhomhe wouldvote for. He said his master wished hiin to vote on the Liberal side, but he would like to have a quarter's rent-3. Witness told him that was too much. Webb saidthen he would go and Eee what the others said. He saw Webb go to Berkeley and Price's committee-room. Witness waited at the door. When Webb came out he had his right hand in his pocket, and a card in his left hand. He then went and voted for Berkeley and Price. Before he voted, he told witness he had got 50Os. Cross-examined.-Witness was not a voter. He did not offer Webb 21. to vote for Carden. Charles Webb was then called, and stated that he did not receive any money in the committee-room. Snowsell, the last witness, asked him if he had got 50s., and he replied perhaps he had. Snowsell had offered him previonsly three sOvereigns to vote for Carden, and he refused. Charles Jeremy said he had promised to vote for Carden. He changed his mind on the day of election, and voted for Berkeley and Price, because his master was a Liberal. He was at the committee-room for an hour before he made up his mind to vote; but ie had no motive for voting. He was pottering up and down stairs at the committee-room, when he made up his mind. Previous to that he meant to vote for Carden. He told Gould and Webb, who took him to Prices committee-room, that he had promised Carden. He did not receive money from any one for his vote. JamesBanhamsaidheservedon a "yellow" committee in Bell-Iane. He was there ozn the polling day. Hfe went there about 10, and afterwards went and voted for Berkeley and Price. Then he went back to the committee-room. He didnothing afterwards. He did not know what he had to do upon the committee. He could not write. Mr. Evans a fortnight after the election paid him 30s. for being on the committee. Mfr. Thomas Evans said he had paid the last witness 30s. Mr. Monk gave him the money. He had paid others. He could not remember how many, but not more than halfa-dozen. He had asked Mr. Monk to put Banham on the committee as a messenger. Mr. Thomas Monk, a voter, and a Liberal, said he had acted as registration agent for the last three or four years. He received 6S. odd for the messengers and 281. odd for the clerks. Those were the oD, y sums he had received and paid on account of the election. Cross-examined.-It was arranged between the two arties that the messengers should be paid 3s. 6d. a-day. e had not bribed any voter during the election, nor had he made any promise to induce any one to vote. The committee adjourned until 12 o'clock this day.
CA?ruRE oF' Al,GAwG or SHrpsTEALERs.-Early onFridaymorning Police-constables Booth, of Cudwortb, near Barnsley, and Shaw, of Darfield, having had their suspicions excited by the proceedings of a party of men, followed them to a place called Storr's-mill, where they saw the fellows maling preparations to slaughter a sheep, which they had selected oat of a flock belonging to Mr. Guest, ofE Cudworth. The policemen were armed with cutlasses, and they had with them a couple of dogs, which, as the thieves approached the constables' hiding place, broke loose and seized one of the robbers, and so terrified the rest that they were captured almost without any difficulty. The prisoners, v hose names are Thomas Sumpson, one of the men charged with being concerned in the Onor Oaks burglary, John Cope, and William Bennett, had on them two life preservers, three sharp pocket knves, two butchers' knives, a saw, arcrowbar, some gauze veils, striped slops, instruments for forcin locks, and other artHicles.

STATE OF TBADE. MANCHESTER, JULY 25. There is very little alteration in the market since yesterday, no advices having come to hand yet from India. For all classes of goods suited to that market Eusiness continues almnost suspended, and most of the goods ordered previous to the last mail remain unsbipped, from a fear that the roads in India wiU be unsafe for the tranamission of merchandise until order has again been restored. In cloths and yarns- sited to most other markets the .lemand at present bears a good proportion to the limited production, and rather better prices are obtainable. The kinds of printing cloths, madapoliams, and shirtings most in demand are now juoted at i1d. to Sd. per piece higher than they were a month ago. In yarns there is still a good demand fromn the continent, and, stocks being scarce, and spinners in some cases under contract, prices continue to advance with the upward tendency of the raw m-ateriaL. BIR31INGHARE, JULY 25. There has been little change in the position of the Soath Staffordshire iron trade daring the weak, but first makers represent prices as firm and prospects as encouraging. Tenders for large quantities of rais are requested for Australia, and American houses are buying more freely than a fortnight ago. The unsettled state of tbe metal-market continues to operate injuriously upon Birmingham manufactures; bnt, notwithstanding, there is a fair demand for certain desoriptions of goods in general ase. The recent advances which have takenpiace s nthe price of tin have causedat present no perceptible alteration in the manufacture of tin wares; bat there is no question that they will have the effect of reducing work;inmany of ourchief establishments. It was hoped that the rates announced a few months ago wrere permanently established, and under that conviction the tin trade was becoming apparently steady, if not brisk; but the rises which have occurred within the presewt week have dissipated this expectation and induced gloomy anticipations. The brass foundry business, although somewhat flat, is improving. The wire manufacture which during the sprini was unusuaUy flat, is active, And large quautities exported to the continent. Unfortunately, during the present week a dispute has arisen between the contractors for the supply of carbines for the troops destined for India and the operative gunmakers with regard to the price to be paid for " stocking." Tho result is that about 500 men ceased work on MIonday and are now out on " strike." It would appear that about three months ago a contract was entered into for the supply of carbines to the East India Company, and the patterns being in some respects new an advance of price was conceded to the men. The delivery under this contract expired on the 4th inst., after which it was proposed by the masters that for the class of work then in hand the remuneration should he after the old rate. To this proposition the stockers refused to assent, and hence the present dispute. Such a contest at the present time cannot be otherwise than injarious to both masters and men. The general ironmongery trades of the town are mode. rately usy, and prospects are represented to be cheering. Stocks throughouLt the country are known to be small, and oredrs are far more liberal than immediately before Kjdsummer. The accounts received throagh the factors are decidedly favourable, and a brisk trade in Birmingham goods Is expected during the autuntn and winter months The demand for almost all descriptions of planters' tools in South America and the West Indies is more than usually l2age. The orders received within the week, even for the season, have been extensive, and by the next mail a large increase is confidently anticipated. LEICESTER, JuzY 35. The hosiery trade is rather more active, the improbability of an reduction in the price of wools or yarns having brought orders for the autumn season. The price of material will prevent manufacturers creating much stock; worsted yarns keep up their price, and in cotton yarns the feel. ing is for higher rates. It will give some idea of the improvements which steam has wvrought in machinery by stating that atEinckley, at a recent saleof stocking frames, 40 of thema were disposed of at an average of 16. per frame; the same frames a fewv years ago would have averaged 61. to 8L. each, NOTTINGGHAM, JULY 25. The lace trade (although rather interfered with by the holydays this week) has improved a shade, and in some branches there is more dotng. Plain nets continue in de. mand, asalso Paris and Queen's quillings. The easier state of themoney-market is operating favourably here. Manufacturers appear determined to have a fair remunerative picefor thelrgoods, and there does not appear any probabilityof an abatement. Upon the whole, the lace trade, although quiet, isnot more so than is usually the case at this season of the year. Masterial continues very high in price, without any likelihood of a diminution. hg npie The hosiery trade is dull; very little is doing for the home market; there have been some Canadian buyersin the market giving orders for winter goods. lIosiery silks and yarns remain very dear. LEEDS, JULY 25. This week's report of the woollen eloth trade is foly as good as the preceding one. Indeed, in the aggregate mora business has been done. The demand is chiefly for winter goods, of which as yet there is no great supply or choice. Some moderate bulks have been purchased for Canada, but Ecarcely equal to what Is usual at this season of the year. The state of India has naturaUy begot i good deal of anxiety in the trading world as in the public mind, and one consequence is the exercise of much caution in commercial tramsactions. Hence most dealinga in the woollen trade are of a smaller character than usuaL At the same time, the tone of the market appears to be healthful, prices are very firm, and manufacturers, if not fuly employed, are not positively slackin work. In the cloth-halls this mornin' there was an average attendance of buyers, and business to : like extent was transacted. Stocks bave lately slightly increased in the publio markets, but the whole bulk in the cloth-haUs at the present time is not beyond the quantity on hand last July. Wool bought at the current colonial sales in London is coming to hand; and should there be any improvement in trade it is likely that a good deal that has been bought for this neighbourhood wiU soon be made mto cloth, as there is not much other in stock here. The condition of the Australian wools has of late improved, but there is still room for more attention to them before they are sent to this country. Home-grown wools are Tery firm in price.

BRADFORD, JurLy 25. The worsted stuff trade presents little variation of importance since our lasS report. There has been a pretty numerous attendance both at our markets and in the warehouses during the past week, and the state of our staple trade, taken as a whvole, may be reported satisfactory. In piece goods a tolerably fair number of transactions are eateredintowith steadiness, and this department, althonuh not brisk, is i a healthyacondition. The pricesobtained by manufacturers have an upwrardtendency, as the high figures obtained for wool are permanently maintained. The prospects of trade in the worsted district are generally considered favourable. There is a very active demand for worsted yarns suitable for shippingpurposes, and the export houses report that they aredoinga good trade. Contracts are entered into with readiness, at prices rather more than of late in favour of the spinners. For home manufacture the inquiry is-not to the average extent at this period of the year, but in the hiinted transactions entered into spinners firmly demand very full rates. As the prices of raw cotton continue gradually to advance in the Lancashire maarkets, proportionately higher rates thau those previously currenthere ate demanded with firmness for cotton yarns, although the busiDness doing is not extensive; the finer yarns are most in request, at enhanced rates, but lower numbers are not sold with so much readiness. In the wool-market a tone of firmness continues to rule. The businesseittered into in combing descriptions does not reach the extent reportable for some weeks past; the spinners do not purchase with so much freedom, having in most instances already obtained considerable supplies of the raw material, and transactions this week are generally confined to assortments required fortheimmediate purposes of trade. For allqualities prices are maintained with much firmness. A steady demand continues to be experienced for short wools, aDd the quantity offering is purchased for the clothing trade at the recent currencies. Our local staplers are now well supplied with wool of the new clip, and their stocks are being augmented by daily arrivals. These are invariably purchased from the growers at exceedingly full rates, and it is therefore considered that the prices current here will experience no diminution. HALIFAX, JUTLY 25. The worsted trade has rather improved; there having been an increased demand for some kinds of goods, such as lastings, damasks, and camblets, and there has been also a better demand for wools and yarns. There was scarcely so good a sale for wool to-day as at th early part of the week, nor were the highest prices realized. DUBLTI, JuLY 24. Business in some branches has been comparatively brisk this week. The extremely fine weather that has prevailed for several days past, and the very favourable accounts from all quarters, at home and abroad, of the flourishing condition of the harvest, have contributed to impart some degree of animaton to trade, and to the reduction to some extent of the extreme prics which articles of general consumption have so long commanded. The Customs' receipts for the wreekto Thursday, July 23, inclusive, were 19,6961., against 18,7261. last week. BELFAST, JULY 24. I.inen.-In rmagh on Tuesdag both rough browns and lawns sold freely; no advance in prices. Lurgr.n market was small, Diapers and damasks unchanged, fiue lawns neglected, coarse sets scarce. Ballymena on Saturday was fairly attended, with a slow but firm market. Linen yarn ContiDnue unaltered. Flas.-The country markets during the past week were very poorly supplied with flax, not more than four or five loads appearing in someof them, and in others none at alL Good strong clean handscutched flax is stiUl in demand, but the quantity in the farmers' hands is almost cleared oat.

RASirWAY INTELIGRNCE. D1UTEC RHENSE, The adjourned nmeeting of thts eompany was held as,4 Amsterdam on Monday to receive the report of the directors; Mr. F. Van Riemsdyk in the chair. The English shareholders were represented by Mr. C; Holland and Mr. Beloo, who held proxies representingabont; 32,000 shares. The report, an abstract ef which has appeared i'lVse Times, was adopted, and a divndend equivalent tols. 3d. per share wras declared. MJr. C. H0LLAND stated that great disappointment wa3. felt by the shareholders at the result of working the lon promised junction with the German lines of railway. Is showed that the fiscal arrangements of the Governments oE Prussia and Hlolland tended rathez to crash than to fosterthe railways which were so well eclculated to promote the, prosperity of the respective countries. The Goveraments, by insisting on the company's rnnning rnight trains merelyfor the conveyance of the mails, and not demanding fron, Prussia that co-operation as to goods' traffic to which they were entitled under the treaty of 1851, and to obtain whicin they had paid l,OW,000fL., did not seem anything like thak conduct to be expeoted of a paternal Government towards railway enterprise. He concluded by moving a resolutioa, for the appointment of a committee of sh,areholders to ad- ise with the directors onthe subject of increasing thotraffil and economizing the working expenses. The motion having been seconded, a commlttee, conaising of Messrs. T.. Moss, S. J. Arnold, C. Mosley, J Robinson, W. Fenton, and W. Morrice, was appointed foeF that purpose, and to report the result to an adjourned* meeting. The appointment of a goods' manager was reeom-- mended, Mr. Hesledon was re-elected a director, the re-,rinr comamissaries were re-elected, and the remainder of the basi. neys was postponed until the 1O0h of September next, whero a report from the committee is to be sabmitted to th*shareholders. - SCINDE. A special meeting of this company was held on Friday, at; the office, Old Broad-street, Mr. Andrews in the chair. The solicitor read the heads of "A Bil for authornz n the Scinde Railway Com panv to extend theiroperatloans - : for regulating the capital of the company, and for otherpurposes." et appeared the Bilr was intended to enable the, companytomakearrangementswith the Hon. East Indi&. Company for the constraction of a railway from hlooltsn ta'Lahore and Umritsir, and also for establishing on the riverIndus between Hyderabad and Mooltan a steam flotilla in: connexion with the Seinde and Ynnjab Railways, and tc>makefurther provisions with respect to the Scinde Company, andtoauthorie the keeping of separate accounts of the. capital, and of the receipts, payments, and liabilities of the, several undertakings of the company. The CHAIEMAN explained that the first object they hadZ in view was the construction of the Scinde Rail way fror, the port of Kurrachee to the Indus, neat Hyderabad, tho, second the establishment of a steam flotilla to connect the, Scinde Railway near Hyderabad with Mooltan, a distance, of about 570 miles, and the third object was the formation.. of x railway from Mooltan to Lahore and IJmritsir in the> Punjaub. The surveys for the latter line were very nearly completed, and he had no doubt of the successful accomplishment of those important works The Scinde Railway. would stand upon its own merits, and have its distinct capi. tal and revenue account. The same would'be the case with>the flotilla on the Indus, and also with the PunjaubRailway;. but, although the capital and revenue accounts of each oCthe threeconceras would be kept distinct, they would bhunder one management. He concluded by moving a formabresolution approving the Bill, wbich was sconded andl- A long conversation then ensued as to the advantages oE' the proposed undertking, and the proceedings concludeewith a vote of thankcs tothe Chairman.

The gross receipts for the half-yearshow an increase of 15,0131. over those of the correspondingb half of 1856, while the expenditure shows a decrease oLn12,2401., thus increasing the sum available for dividend by27,2541 over that of the first half of 186, The working expenses were reduced from 67.34 per cent, in the first half oa? 86 to 46.53perceut.iDthe firsthalf of 1857.

THE ATLANTIC SUBMARILE TBLEG.RAPH. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-We have jcustread iaan article in The Times of thi-- day headed *' Atlantic Sabmarine Telegraph" the followin: paragraph:- "We have alrealy explained to our readers how tho. cable is coated with closely woven spiral wires, to preventdamage to the core in paying out; but, in conse- quence of the two halves having been made at differentplaces-one at Birkenhead, by Messrs. Newall, and, the other at Greenwich, by Glasse and Elliot, E most egregious blunder has been committed. It will scarcely be credited, but it is nevertheless true, that thes twist of the spiral wires of the Birkenhead half is inexactly the opposite drection to the twist of the wires im the half made at Greenwich. Thus, when joined in thocentre of the Atlantic they will form a right hand and a- left hand screw, and the tendency of each will be ta, assist the other to untwist and expose the core. By attaching a solid weight to the centre joining it is hopec. this direclty and dange ma be orercome, but none at, tempt to conceal that the mistake is much to be regretted. We are informed that Messrs. Glasse and Elliot had nearlyD 100 ndilles of their .portion of the cable completed befores Messrs. Newall commenced theirs, and that therefore the fault rests w^ith the firm w^hich began last." We rely on your sense of fairness to allowr this lette- ab corner in 27c Times to rebut the charge of our having committed a " most egregious blunder." L The conclusion drawn by your correspondent that weare in fault is certainly not warranted. Admitting all thepremises, how were we to know anything about Maesz.. Glasse and Elliott's work ? We have no entry to their pre. mises, and could know nothing of the lay of the cable thoy had manufactured. 2. We took our contract from the Atlantic Telegrapl. Company in December last, and we were sapplied by their engineer with a specimen of the cable to be made. We1consttacted new machinery specially adapted for the mann.- factute of this cable ofthe same lay as the specimen supplied to ns. We began to manufactare the last week of February, and when we began about 200 miles had been made at;Greenwich. The engineer of the company then found that; the lay of the csble at the two works was in reverse direr. tions, and asked us to alter it in ours. We could not do. this without altering the machinery which, as before said, had been specially prepared for the work, and this woallp have involved a delay of three weeks, so that the engneer decided against any alteration. As it has turned out it would certainly have been better to have a]tered it, for, although we had not begun our half of the cable till tho Greenwich firm had completed about 203 miles, yet; we had completed our part when they had upward3 of 150 miles stiUl to do, so that there w^ould have been ample time to make the necessary alterations in the machinery 'without delay in the completion of the cable. How'. ever, that Was no affair of ours; we were bound to complete the cable by a certain day under a penalty of 501. a-day, and wo did it; and if the engineer expected the same punctuality from the other contractors we think he was right in not risking delay by alteration of our machinery. 3. The specimen of the cable given to us for our gnida3ce in the manufacture was not made by us, but we believe it 'as made by Messrs. Glasse and Elliott. At any rate, it ie for the engineer to explain how it came to pass that different directions were given to the two contractors; and perhaps the gentleman who gave yon the information that we are in fault can throw some light on the subject as to hrw the specimen given to us happened to be of a contrary lay. to the cable manufactured at Greenwich. The inconvenience arising from the " blander" is, w, think, overrated by you, and rzelly of smal importance. We aro, Sir, yoar obedient sertnt6 IL S- NMW.9AT.T..- -n zi, Abkngdon-street, Westminser, Jy 24. TH SE SSIO.-There seems to be no probabilitv of Parliament being prorogued before the 20th of August.

XONIBY-.AflKETaBWCITYINTBLLIGBNCE. Saturday Evening. Business has been almost suspended in the StockTFxchange to-day owing to the non-receipt of any linoian news, and prices have undergone little diuctuation.' The tendency of the market, however, ]isa been towards firmness. Consols for money, -which closed last evenit g at 91i, were first quoted Oli to i, and they returned to that price after a ahort period, during which there had been sellers at -01J. For the 6th of August the last traneactions 'w(re at 91 toe. Bank Stock left off at214to 216; Reduced, 9J]0 to {; New Three per Cents., 91J to 9)2; Tndia Stock, 214 to 216i; India Bonds, 25s. to 15s. discount;; and Exchequer-bills, B7s. to 4s. dis. c3xunt. I he market for foreign securities is characterized ly a total want of animation, but prices continue to - e firmly maintained. Buenos Ayres were nego:iated at 85i; Mexican, for the account, 224 and i; fRussianiFour-and-a..Balf per Cents., 97:t ; Spanish, for the account, 4C1 ; Turkish, for the account, 94 1 and 95; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 102k; ard Dutch Vour per Cents., 98. The final quotation of the French Three per 'Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 66f. ,COc. for both money and account, showing in the latter case a fractional decline. A further sum of 80,0001. in bar gold has been mvithdrawn from the Bank to-day for transmission to he continent for silver. Therate of exchange from ]Paria shows flatness, and although there would be mno actual profit on specie remittances, they would Kprobably serve as well as any other mode for parties 'caving payments to send from London. Some demand for money is likelv to be created by 1he preparations for the despatch of troops to India. ahe total to be expended in connexion with the asteam and other transports lately hired cannot faU -much short of half a million, and,'as the payment of 4wo-thirds of the amount is to be delayed until after the arrival of the vessels in India, the contractors -will have to wait nearly six months before they can ;be reimbursed. Ultimately the remittance from lndia will operate beneficially, and serve to counterwct the effect of a diminution in the consignment of .ggoods to that market. The Board of Trade returns for the past month 1have been issued to-day. For the fitst time this ;year they fail to show an increase in the declared -value of our exportations. The diflerence on the -ther side, however, is but 30,2471., and it is to be remarked that the month of June, 1856, was one *sf extraordinary activitv, since, as compared with -the preceding year, it showed an augmentation of 12,500,0001. The chief falling off in the shipments on the preednt occasion has been in cotton manu-factures. It amounts tO 391,5341., but may be re,garded merely as a natural reaction from the enor3nous increase of 850,4891. presented under that {head in the preceding month. In a majority of the other principal articles the totals are on the .favourable side. The subjoined table exhibits the -exact increase or decrease in each case:- Dxon&nx VALUE OF £xPoxRTAPrTON The total of our exports for the first Bix months .f the year has been 60,82G,3811., showing an inhcrease of G,857,9651., or about 113- per cent., upon &he corresponding half of 1856. The changes have curred in the following manmer:- Increaso. Decrease. January . .. S3,3l9 ..

With regard to imnported commodities, the arrivals during the n4onth of June have been upon an average ale. They include some considerable quantities of grain. The cousnmption of articles of food and uxury shows in several instances,-among which are coffee, sugar, cocoa, spirits, wine, and spices,-a slight diminution. Tea and tobacco exhibit an increase. Subjoined are the quantities of provisions, &C., ; ported and taken for home consumption:- i tne mwaceianeous imports, which were modete during the preceding month, there has been a neral revival. Dyes and dyeing stuffs, hides ther manufactures, metals, oils, and timber, have arrived in large quantities. The Government have chartered the Imperador d Imperatriz, two steamers belonging to the uth American Steam Company of Liverpool, to rry troops to China. They are of 1,800 tons rden, swift, and with capacity for the accommo. tion of a large number of persons. It is thought men may be taken by each. The following is an abstract of the railway intelence of the week:-At the meeting of the LonnB Brighton, and South Coast the report was aziimously adopted, and a dividend of 21. lOs. sihare declaredfor the half-year. The amount unexpended capital being only 1,0681., tho tore propose to apply for power to raise ,Oool. for the purpose of improving and repairstations, and for other works of absolate neces- The gross revenue showed an increme of 61. over the corresponding half of 1856. The nsec had also been greater arising from - cost of working the West-end line, now parig for the first time, from the high co of materials, and from the cost of the rongh repair of the rolling stock. The relaying, of the main line is nearly completed. It appears by the report of the auditors that the mortgage debt has increased by the sum of 36,8001., and the permanent way improvement account by 15,6441., 3,0001. of which has been placed to the debit of the revenue account for the past half-year. The net revenue of the Oxford, Worcester, and Volverbampton allows the payment of the full dividend on the first guaranteed stock, and one-half per cent. per annum on the second. By the 'eport of the directors of the Dutch Rhenish no dividend will be declared. Since the junction with the Prussian lines the expenses have swallowed up nearly all the receipts. The cost of working has been 45 per cent. during the summer, and 80 per cent. in winter. This increase is caused principally by the Government requiring night trains. The Leominster and Kington Railway will be opened on the 28th inst. At the meeting of the Madras Company the report was adopted unanimously. It appears that the number of miles opened was 81, which would be increased to nearly 100 by the close of the year. The line will be completed from coast to coast before the end of 1859. The traffic had not been Po great as was expected-a circumstance attributed to the railway not being extended far enough into the interior, and to the prejudice of the natives for the ordinary road. Some dissatisfaction was expressed agains'D the interference of the local Govemment. The balance in hand is now about 360,0001., and the next call will be on the 4i per cent. shares, but it cannot be made before October. At the meeting of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire the report and accounts were adopted, and a divideid at the rate of 11. per cent. per annum declared. Explanations were given in reply to the statementsof the London and North-Wester2i re- specting the annuling of the agreement between the two companies, and a vote of confidence in the directorr was passed. The report of the directors of the North Staffordshire shows a large increase in the receipts from the railway and canal for the past half-year as compared with the corresponding period of 1856, mainly to be attributed to the local trade. The receipts are now equal to the maximum amaount guaranteed by the London and North-Westem under the traffic arrangements formerly existing between the two companies. The inet profits, exclusive of the large claims against the above company, will enable a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum to be declared. A Bill to empower the Scinde Railway Company to construct a line from Mooltan to Lahore and Umritsir, and to establish a steam flotilla between Hyderabad and Mooltan, on the Indus, has been approved at a meeting of the shareholders. The flotilla will connect the upper terminus of the Scinde Railway and the lower terminus of the Punjab. These arrangements will reduce the time occupied in a journey from Kurrachee to Mooltan to five days, being less than a fifth of that now occupied by the steamers on the Indus. The annexed information regarding the mining business of the week iY extracted from the Mining Jousnal - ' Theaspectoftheminingshare-markethas improved since our last journal, and the week opened with an active demand for shares generally.

The Linares Lead M ining Company report the surface work is moving on satisfactorily, and the tribute pitches throughout the mine are looking moderately well." The Netherlands Land Enclosure Company have issued a report preparatory to their meeting on the 30th. The operations of the past 12 months have been favourable, not only as regards the amount of additional land redeemed, hut also as to the crops obtained fro n the portions sow n with colza last year. The Portuguese.Government have invited tenders for the construction of an artificial port at the Island of St. Michael, in the Azores. Any individuals or conipanies, native or foreign, may join in the competition. The Government of Buenos Ayres have published certain modifications of the tonnage and import duties levied by that State. The last American papers contain the following with regard to the reorganization of the Collins line of mail steamers :- " COLss LINSz or STEAArSEAs.-We are informed that the Columbia, which made her last passage to New York in 11 2 days, will snake one more trip so as to leave Liverpool the 5th of August.

The weather has been moderately cool ouring the week, and there ha~ve been ceverml showers of rain, which have proved very beneficial to potatoes, turLisp, and gras, and hive checked the too rapid growth of grain. Tue first harvest operations in this district wis commence at about the end ornext week. Wheat isnot thick onatheground, nor do the ears cenerally.run large, baetit is admitted on all hands that the yleld will be good, the grain being very large, so mnuch so that thu crops will have to be coit before they are ripe to obviate the lose which will otherwise arise from the grain shaking out of the husk. The trade in wheat was very depressd in the oarly pact of the week. but it hbs since somewhat raMlle, and the latterrmaLrtets have ox. hiiblted a decided tendency on the part of holdera to resist any forthe, decline in prioeg.

Next week there isa probability ol many parorls being On offer. Iu the crn-excbance to-day the stands were only moderstely occupied with samples of wheat, much below the quantity of lst week, bat the attoution of the farmerg being engaged in the cattlo. fair in some measbre accounts for this.

LONDON, MON.DAY, JZLY 27, 1857. Seldom does a great catastrophe happen without some warning, though it may require acuteness and experience to interpret the sign. The stillness which precedes the earthquake and the smoothness of the river before it becomes a cataract are well known illustrations of the fact that portentous quiet and apathy often precede a political outbreak. For some years India has beenin the depth of tranquillity. The British arms have overthrown every external foe, and our authority seemled to be established securely over the whole extent of the land. So far as Englishmen at home believed, India had entered on a new |career, when Brahmins would become not only virtuous and wise, but also instructed in the ways of civilization; when caste would die out, hereditary distinctions fade away, widows marry, beef make its appearance in the shops, and clothing take the European form. Since the Burmese war no insult had been ofered to our power anywhere; Oude had been annexed in peace, the Punjab changed into an attached province ; even Pegue was beginning to pay. Confidence might well reign in the hearts of Governors and Commanders-inuijef. And it was carried to its extreme. Sepoy Regiments guarded our Government-houses, our banks, our arsenals, and. powder-magazines. Wnat a Sepoy Regiment is in matter of organization we have now an opportunity of learning, but, till within a few weeks the thing was a mystery into which no home-keeping Englishman cared or dared to penetrate. Yet, to do Le authorities justice, they saw the rottenness of the edifice; they were not deceived by the fair show of content. Portions of the correspondence which has passed between the Court of Directors and the Home Goverment and between the Court and the GovxasuonGuanAz have been published, and show that the defects of the regimental organization were brought to the notice of the authorities at home more than a year ago. On the 5th of April, 1856, the GovERNoR-GENISAL in Council writes to the Court of Directors that the pressure of officers for detached employment had become so great that it was necessary to take measures to supply the existing vacancies of ensigns, as well as to appoint supernumerary cadets. " In some "'regiments," it is declared, "there are seven, "and in some more than seven, officers per regi"ment on Staff and detached employ." In September last the Directors say, in answer to the GOVERSOR-OENERAL, that " the difficulties which " our several Govermments, and especially those of "Bengal and Bombay,have experienced in providing "officers for Staff and other detached employ"ments, and at the same time in mainta;ning "regimental efficiency, have been long a source of "anxiety to us." They then intimate their intention of sending supernumerary cadets, but add, " We need hardly say the appointment of one or "more officers to the* rank of Ensign, in addition "to those at present on the establishmient of a ":Regiment of Native Infantry, would not be the "remedy required to meet effectually the present "exigencies of the Indian Army." They then quote the following opinion of Sir . IER, expressed 10 years before :-" The Court of "Directors may rest aessured that neither the " native officers nor the Sepoys look with either "respect or affection on a set of European officers "Cwho, as far as I can observe, scarcely speak to, "rmuch less micx with and study the character of, " the native officers." We have given these extracts to show that many months since all that the world has learnt withl astonishment from the present outbreak was known to the authorities, and a remedy devised. But so distant seemed the danger that the Directors had no notion of incurring much expense in guarding against it. " These considerations," they say, " would have induced us to determine "to allow two additional Captains to every native "regiment in our service; but in the actual con"dition of the finances we must confine ourselves to sanctioning your appointnent of one addi"tional Captain and one additional Lieutenant "to every Native Regiment." This was the state of things a year ago, andthese the half-measures devised for lessening the evil. But the war with Persia tried even more strongly the capabilities of the lndian| Army. The two great wants wero European troops and European officers to the native troops. In a minute dated in February last the GovsxnoiGuvENBr says .-" It is certain that large rein" forcements will be needed before a second cam"paign can be entered upon. In supplying this "force the European Infantry will be the chief "difficulty. I am satisfied that the Third Division "ought to include not less than six European "Regiments of Infantry and one of Cavalry. "Whence are those regiments to be drawn ? "Bombay can give no more. Four European "regiments only are left to that Presidency and "its outpost at Aden. Madras can give none. "The entire occupation of Pegue is in course "of being transferred to the Madras army. "The whole force, therefore, must be sup"plied from Bengal." Lord CAiNIG then continues to say that the Army of India is not established on a scale calculated to meet the drain of a war carried on 2,000 miles from its shores, and that the Bengal Army in particular, being spread over a wide area, having to guard the frontier and occupy our most recently acquired province, can only spare three European Regiments for Persia, being just half the number required for a single division. Here we have the two great evils of our Indian military organization admitted and discussed months before the breaking out of the mutiny. Even on another point,-that of substituting irregular and local troops for the regular Sepoys,-the Court of Directors had much to say as long ago as last September. But the principal defects-the absence of European troops and the smaU number and youth of theEuropean officers in native regiments-seera to have created apprehensions which, unfortunately, were only not strong enough. The practice of drawing away the best, the cleverest, and the most hardworking officers for Staff and other appointments, and leaving the actual command to the young, the stupid, and the lazy, seems to have been carried to the last point of iznprudence. The account from all aides is the eame. The officers are young, ignorant of the language, and slow in acquiring it, from mixing little with the natives. The Sepoy IRegiments are reanly officered by men of their own race and religion, who teach the young gentlemen from England the routine of duty. The latter learn to look upon service with their regiments as a vexation, and, after a time, as a humiliation. Every one who is anybody is draughted away to something else, and of course it is both onerous and mortifying to remain. When seven or more of the senior officers are away, getting higher pay and with the prospect of indefinite advancement, it cannot be wondered at that the regimental service should be demoralized, and as little that the Hindoos should discover the fact. We find that more than a year ago the GovEurwoR-Gmi-mtA and the Directors were corresponding on this subject. It certainly cannot be said that a remedy could have been proposed so immediately active as to avert the calamity which has just come upon the country. This has, indeed, been the necessary result of a system in existence for many years, and the stream could probably not have been turned aside by any human power. But still, with so serious a condition of things before their eyes, we cannot but wonder that a stricter discipline was not at once introduced. Of course, the financial question was at the bottom of everything. The state of their Exchequer would, as we have seen, not allow the Court to appoint two extra Captains, but only one Captain and a Lieutenant, to a regiment, although the Govunifon-GmmAL had recommended the former plau. Similarly financial considerations have prevented the sending out European troops in sufficient force, so that Bombay and Bengal have been denuded for the Persian War, and Madras for tho Burmese occupation. We see now what comes of all this economy. A civil war is upon us, which may cost miillions of money, and check for years the progress of Asia.
What has become of the great Sewage question ? Time was when the town was frightened out of its wits by a discussion of all the evils which might, and certainly will, one day arise from the presence of a vast stream of refluent pollution in the very centre of the metropolis. The cholera hadbeen among us in those days, and every Londoner, whether permanent inhabitant or temporary resident, was alarmed for his own safety and for the safety of his household, of his friends, and, if a man of large xympathies, of his acquaintances even, and of the public in general. The eholera is gone, and, true to our human nature, we are forgetful of past griefs, and live on from day to day in indifference. In the year 1849 the grim visitor made its presence felt among us with terrible effect. In 1854, gin, streets in the politest quarter of the town were blocked up as unfit for access. A few yards to the east of Regent-street a man who did not wish to risk his life must have chosen his path with care. The " No thoroughfare" ot 1854 wvas equivalent to the " LoRD have mercy on " us 1" of 1666. All this is now forgotten; we are more apt at calculations and economics than at reasonable precautions. "Sewage" is a cuckods note, of which the ratepayer's ear is very weary; the business is put by till the foors convenient season-that is, until it is too late. Now, if we had in our collective capacity of fellow-townsmen the same degree of prudence which the great majority of us exercise in our private affairs we should take advantage of this tempus pnitfen ti to set our Babylon in order. We have had. broad hints enough fromthe cholera, and when the pestilence comes upon us again it should not find us unprepared. Moist houses are insured against fire; in most families the children are vacciaated in due season; how is it, then, that we do not insure ourselves during the period of respite against a peril whichis fully equalto either of these? The question of the Loidon Sewage and of the purification of the Thames still remains unsolved; nor does there appear to be much prospect of wiser counsels. To-day we would call attention to a very minute section of this great work, which may possibly in time and with importunity be carried out. We can scarcely hope, until the cholera shall again comae to our aid, to be heard, so far as tho Thames is concerned; poEsibly we may gain attention when we speak of the Serpentine. Sir BENTAmw EL halately been doing a very good work in St. James's Park, to the satisfaction of the public and the displeasure of Lord D HImIxBuny. It is a pleasure now towalkin St. James'sgarden* and to feel that there is no exhalation from fetid water rising up around one's path, and that the children who are sent there to play can do SO without peril to their health. Experience, of course, must be the test of the soiidity of the work, but if it maintains its promise the Londoners who inhabit that quarter of the town have every reason to bless the name of Sir B3NJAwaN HA&xr. A better job was never done. Now that it is completed, and Lord MAuMEisBtr has had his fling at it, we-would invite attentionto the condition of that which might a year back have been described as the sister pollution of the Serpentine. It is high time that this nuisance should be taken in hand. The Pond in the Green Park hsa been filled up, the Lake in St. James's Park has been effectually purified. By a natural sequence we arrive at Hyde Park and the Serpentine. We will speak presently of the reports of scientific men upon the subject, but it is one on which we require no considerable aids from science in order to arrive at a just conclusion. Let anyone who wouldmake up his mind on the sabject saunter along the southern bank of this sheet of liquid dirt about 8 o'clock p.m., when hundreds of bathers are about. The only parallels we could name would be the Pool between London-bridge and the Tunnel and the harbour at Marseilles. If you are in search of filth and dirt, circum.pice-there they are. Nor is this result to be wondered at when the circumstances of the case are duly weighed. It appears that the sewage of a large district is now poured into the Serpentine, as well as the water impregnatea with the decomposition of thousands of hurnan corpses. It is curious enough to reflect that the beauty and fashion of London should have chosen such a spot as the locality of their favourite promenade. Lounging .in their carriages, or careering along on horseback, they pass to and fro -by the, side of that green pool, seething in the hot July sun, which holds in solution so many of their fellow-creatures who but a few years back were even such as they are nowmillinery perhaps excepted. There is a sewer, we say, which empties itself into the Serpentine, after having drained a considerable portion of the North-western portion of the metropolis and of the suburban districts of the same region. The subject is not a savoury one, but, as it is important that the public should be rightly informed of what the Serpentine really is, it is perhaps as well to give particulars. There is a sewer which runs from Frognal, near Eampatead; there is another which runs from Kensal New-town. These two sewers unite in one chaimel a little to the North of the Harrow-road. " They pass through "a sewer of 10 feet 6 inches by 8 feet 6 inches from "Gloceater-terrace to the head of the Serpentine, "near the Bayswater-road. At this point the "sewer decreases in size from 8 feet 6 inches by " 10 feet 6 inches to an opening of 6 feet by 4 feet, and when the sewage in this diminished " aperture rises 4 feet above the bottom of the "drain the overflow is discharged into the "Serpentine, thus causing the pollution of "the water." Nor is this all; in addition to the many thouands of houses which have their discharge into this sewer, or union of sewers, the great Cemetery at Kensal-green pours its drainage into it. There is besides a new Cemetery to be opened at Kilburn, where the soil is of a very retentive character. This also will have its drainage into the sewer already named. All this wiU go to add tone and quality to the perfumes which the londoners mutst needs inhale fom the Ornamental Water in Kensington-gardens and from the Serpentine. These being the data, we now come to the results, independently of the conclusions at which ordinary men may arrive by a bare use of their senses. Dr. HAssAL was called upon to report on the condition of the water in the Serpentine, and he found it to be highly impure, " containing "much organic matter, vegetableand animal-dead, "living, and in solution.". The green hue of the water is produced by the presence in great quantities of a vegetable production to which scientific men have given the namae of apanizomeno,flosattce, and it is mentioned in the report that it is a vegetable production of the same class which gives the red tinge to the Rted Sea. Ghastly creatures of all kinds seem to hold their " at homes" in this filthy pool; among others, mention is made of a worm or annelid, named spirostonunm arnbigium, which is never found unless the water is highly impure. It abounds in the Serpentine. The mud at the bottom is putrid and black-in fact, this sheet of liquid pollution is in as bad a condition as it can well be. This being so, Sir BuNT}iaw MLL proposes to execute a series of works of the tame kind as thosewhichhe has carried to so success- lul an issue irn St. James's Park. The chief desiderata would of course be to divert the sewage, to expose the mud for a certain time to the purifying influ- ence of the atmosphere, to cover it in with con(rete, and then to secure a perenniai and suffiient supply of pure running water. The experiment of carting away the mud in any considerable quantityI would be attended with too much risk, and would, in all probability, breed a peatilence in the neighbourhood. It is, then, a question of levelling, of filling up holes, of bringing the bottom, in short, to an even and uniform surface, on which the concrete can be laid, as it has been in St. James's Park. The proposer of this excellent project and his advisers have naturally decided that the depth shall be so regulated that from the moment the imuprovements are car- ried out there shall be an end of the functions of the IRoyal Humamg Society with regard both to skaters and swimmers on and in the Serpentine and the Kensington-gardens sheet of water. We heartily recommend the subject to the favoutmble consideration of the public. From the manner in which the less important improvements have been received by everybody except Lord 3!AMSBuRuy, Sir BEN2m J HALL may augur favourably of the results which will follow from an extension of his plans.
To-morrow Sir DE LACY EvANs wSi propose his resolution on MIilitary Education. Although the breakdown of 1854 and the consequent outcry have for the present put a little energy into our Axmy, which is now in the hands of younger, stronger, amd more earnest men than those who adminiAtered it before the war, yet there is no saying how long it mnay be before all the abuses which security and inaction beget may once more begin to gather roulnd the newly burnished system. Indeed, we have o security that the disasters and the experience of the late war will be turned to any account at all. The appointment of a new Secretary of State and the consolidation of certain offices in the crisis of the strugglowere, no douxbt, useful reforms; nor can we speak in too high praise of the attempt to teach officers and men their duty during peace by an imitation of the practices of war. But these changes are incomplete, and will be unavailing, without the proper instruction of the offlcer n his duties. Military Education must be the basis of every military system. Without a knowledge of war as a science a nation cannot expect to be on an equality with great monarchies, *which devote their best heads to it year after year. It may, indeed, happen that great generals will arise who have never studied inwilitary schools, just as plain workmen become great engineers and half-edaucated plcughmen immortal poets. But we might as soon expect that law or physic could be practised without previous education as that the art of war should be revealed to men on the battlefield by a sudden inspiration. Education does not, indeed, insure genius, but it allows it free play. If all that Tvmzrx, and FnxEDRICK, and NAPOLEOEo discovered in to be thought out afresh by each new commander for himself, then indeed we must wait for a wonderful i concourse of military prodigies before we can Tenture on a campaign. But if the experience of the past can, in war as in everything else, be recorded for the benefit of those living, if military treatises can teach officers to do their duty well, and place generals on a level with more able antagonists who have not had a similar training, then education must be of the highest importance. Sir DE LAcy Ev Cs's resolution is to the effect that a more completeprovisionisnecessaryfor affording high professional instruction to the conmissioned ranks of the army, and especially to the Staff, and that this wil be best obtained by recourse to competitive examination for the Staff, and with some qualifications for the Cavalry and Infantry. In the resolution proposed we cordially concur, and trust that the Governient -will at length see the necessity of extending to the Miltary Service the same principles of free entrance and fair examination which have already been established in the Civil Departments. The authorities are, indeed, said to be in favour of education, on which point the conutry wil tale no denial, but to be unwilling to submit the teaching to the rough test of examination. To enlarge Sandhurst, keeping up much the same system as before, to admit to commissions by nomination, as of old, and to establish merely a pass examination, are, we believe, the plan which finds favour in high quarters. But it is needless to say that such a scheme would be no advance on the present system. Even now there is an exoamination on admittance to the service, and we have it on good authority that it has never yet prevented any youth from getting a commission. What is the value of a test which never excludes-of a certificate which every one is sure to gain? Without competition even an enlarged and enriched Sandhurst would fail of producing any effect. The number entering would be limited, since all would have received nominations, and the whole of these vould pass the final examinations just as they pass those which are now in existence. There would be uo incentive to learn anything, since the result to the industrious and the idle would be the same, and to work would be looked upon as a proof of littleness of spirit, if not of a desire to take an unfair advantage. The application of the competitive system, with lsome qualifications, to the appointment to commissions seems therefore highly desirable; but of much more importance is it that places on7 the Staff should be given only to those who have fully proved their capacity. This matter I has been so often discussed that there is little more to be said. The facts are plain enough. The Staff is intrusted with most important duties; in the march, in the encampment, in the actual batfle, the safety of the soldier and the success of the campaign depend on the skill, judgment, and decision of this limited body. Not only the General Staff. of the Army but the private Staffs of the Generals should be composed of mea for whose fitness the country has some guarantee. We call admit no difference between the two cases, nor hold that any commander is justified in surrounding himself with relatives and friends, on the ground that one man does as well for an Aide-deCanp as another. Every continental Power makes the education of the Staff a principal subject of military administration, aud England must do the same. It is found that no system urges to labour so much as that by which success is the immediate reward of application; and if the country desires a supply of officers fitted for the highest duties of their profession it will do well to endorse the principles contained in the resolution of the old Crimean General.

Their commanders are well accustomed to the transport service, fromtheir long experience in the late war with Russia, during which theso steamships rendered the most valuable and efficient aid in the conveyance of troops, stores, &c., to and from the Crimea. No ateamers beloning to the British mercantile marine are more perfecty adapted to carry troops on long voyages, possessing as they do the utmost capacity for the purpose, and apreadmng canvas equal to that of lineof.battle ships, eombining therewith the additional advantage of adequate steam power for calm3 and head winds.

SECOND EDITION. EHB TIMB&OPPICE, Monda11y MoLing. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. 'The following is the letter of our Paris corre Opondent, dated yesterday (Sunday), 6 p.m.:- M. Ledru Rollin has addressed a long letter to the Juge d'Instruction of Paris, who is charged with preparing the evidence in the case of the Italian con- spirators, with the view of clearing himself of any *connexion with them. It is presumed that M4. Ledru takes advantage of the opportunity to declare his lxorror of the crime of assassination for any cause 'and under any pretext, and that he will inlvite M4. 34azzini to follow his example. The mauner in ,Which the English press has spoken of the plotfor, whoever may prove to be the conspirators, plot there seems to be-and the probability of the conspirators in Eng,land being disagreeably interrupted, appear to have elicited the denials of participation 'Which have as yet appeared. The Austrian Government is said to have signed a convention with various Italian States, the object of which is to resist in fature any revolutionary -attacks. On the occasion of the Emperor's fete, on the 15th August, Rear-Admiral Rigault de Genouilly, who commands the French naval division in Chiua, will be promoted to the rank of Vice-Admiral. It is expected that several powerful Kabyle chiefs who 'have recently acknowledged the French domination in Africa are coming to Paris, and wiU be present -pt these festivities. The inaugurations whnich wiU take place on and about the 15th August will, it appears, be very numerous. Although the official programme has niot yet been definitively decided on, it may be znentioned that it is in contemplation to inaugurate the six i)avillons of the Central Balles, the thronetoom at the Palace of the Luxembourg, the church of St. Clotilde, the Asylum in the Bois de Vin-cennes for convalescent workmen, and the New Louvre. That of the Louvre will, it is said, take place on the 14th, and be presided over by the Emperor in person. M. Fould, the Minister of :3tate, is to convoke for the occasion all the artists wrho have taken part in the ornamentation of the ,palace. Deputations from the different bodies of workmen wiU attend. The Emperor wiU be re-ceived by the Minister of State, who will present to His bIlajesty a detailed report on the completion -of the Louvre, in which it will be shown by figures what that magnificent building has cost, 4and that it has been terminated within the time ,fixed by the decree which ordered its execution. !Phe recompenses awarded to the artists wiU be -listributed at the same time. In the evening, all 'the artists and delegates from the corporations of workmen will be present at a grand banquet at which the Minister of State will preside. On the 15th the Louvre will be opened to the public. The .Six paviVons of the Central Halles are now completely finished, and form one of the most important improvements which have been made In Paris. Private letters from Athens of the 17th inst. apeak of the "splendid reception" given by the :Russian Minister to the Queen on Her Majesty's emILarcation on board the Russian frigate. The writer neays:- "1 It is confidently affirmed that she preceded the King on board, and, on complimenting the Russian captain, observed that such a reception was a favourable omen of the fature. 'The news of what Is said to have occurred in the Parliament -ef the lonlan islands has beerL received at this Court with auuch delight. The Camarilla feels tle greatest satisfac-tion in reporting that the hand of Russia has been busy among the native troops in India. The Greek patriots, who la 1854 first arrested the efforts of the Cainarilla in the service of tussia, and against the Western Po wers, and who by doing so essentially served England and France, are now -forgotten by these Powers, who at that timue could ill have spared 15,03 0 men to repress the diversion. They seem to think light of these services now that the danger is past, while Russia is showering every sort of benefit on her devoted supporters in Athens." Another letter from the same place, and of the Pame date, is to this effect:- It is now three years since the Queen of Greece left Athens at the same time that Prince Meuschikoff quitted Constautinople. The Queen made no secret that her object In quitting Greece for Germany was to plead the cause of her uncle Nicholas-for so she was accustomed to call the Mrmperor of Rassia. Her Majesty landed at Trieste, where sihe convoked the leading Greek merchanlts, and informed them that the hour had arrived for the resuscitation of the HIeltenic race throughout the world, but that the sacred cause wanted a littlo ready money to promote it. The Greeks of Trieste communicated with the Greeks in other parts of Europe, and a handsome sum was collected, which -was presented ' on the altar of the country.' It was this fund which enabled the Queen to make the move she did in ifavour of her uncle. On the present occasion Her Majesty has sailed from the Pircus'in a Russian frigate, and her present intention isto try to secaure thesuccessionto the throne of Greece for her youngest brother, a Prince of the house of -Oldsnburg. But, in order to succeed, she must first set aside the faumily of Bavaria, which, for the last 14 years, has hest-tated to accept the conditions (a change of religion) by wvhich only the crown can be obtained. You may depend iupon the fact, in spite of any denial to the contrary, that *he Queen will employ every diplomaatic intrigue, without -the sihghtest scruple, to attain her object. She is accompanied by her confidant, the First Lady of the Bedohamber, who is the President of the Camarilla at Athens. Should UTer Majesty and her confidential adviser succeed, the Emperor of Russia wiU soon have a representative at Athens, in the future successor to the throne, quite as aubsrervient to him as his present vassals, and who will do his cbest towards indemanifying him for his losses in the Crimea. Her Majesty's task, however, is by no means an easy one. There are yet 16 men in the Athenian Senate who, as honest patriots, are in decided opposition to her, -and who succeeded in baffling her exertions in favour of unssia in 1854. They wiiU resist the nomination of an C)ldenburg to the utmost. They have had enough of little Genran Princes. It iH to be regreated that the Qaeen has gained over a number of the Diplomatic Corps to a cause pregnantvwith future evil to Greece. From that nuamber, however, is to be excepted Mr. Wyse. The members of the opposition at Athens and the independent press think that if the Court of Bavaria refuse the successIon to the throne, the Greek nation has a right, in virtue of the 45th article of the Constitution, to choose the succesbor from its own people, and it is not certain that the European Powers Vould refuse to recognize that choice." Private letters from Toulon of the 25th announce that the English squadron of evolutions under tho orders of Admiral Lyons had put to sea, and was 4onthe way to Algiers. It was afterwards to visit Tunis and Tripoli. Accounts from Algiers mention that General M'Mahon had arrived there on the 20th. During his absence General Bombaki had taken the command of his division. General d'Mahon was charged with a mission of inspection in Algeria, after completing which it was believed lie would retUrn to France. Joseph Napoleon Ney, Prince of Moskowa, and eldest son of Marshal Ney, died yesterday morning, at St. Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. So late as Wednesday evening the Prince took a carriage airing on the terrace of St. Gernain. His health had J)een for the Last two years greatly shattered by re. peated attacks of apoplexy. A softening of the brain was apparent on Thursday, and the Prince lost from that moment till he expired all conscious. mess, The Prlnce of Moskowa was born on the 21st of May, 1804; he was the godson of the Emperor, i!Tapoleon L and the Empress Josephine. His ob. Fequies wiU take place to-morrow at the church of _Wotre Dame de Lorette, in Paris. The Seine i3 now lower than it has been at any -period since 1719, when the water was not higher than the bottom of the scale placed at the bridges to mark its depth. All the foundations of the piers are now exposed. The following private letter, dated Algiers, 21st .nst., desecribes the complete submission of Kaby&lia. " It is from AISiers I write to you at present, for our tampalgn Is concluded, Th@re remains notiun AH)rabf1aone tlibe, however small, or however carefully concealed in the recesses of its mountains, vrhich has not made its submission and given hostazes ine the payment of its tributo. Tribes slready subdued, but whose position near the great focus of insurrection had tempted to agitate a little, and whose people bai supplied contingents to the enemy, suoh as the Mloxta-ou-Somer, the Ouzellaquen, the Ooled-el-Hansmam, have been again visited by us and chastised for their lukewarmness and their hesitation. Kabylia is now really subdued, and it is not one of the least remarkable features of this great result that at a distance it may with difficulty be balieved. Ask our soldiers-they are good.judges ; they know how to appreciate the daily progress of tho work in which they assisted with so muchdevotedness. Thus, when the last great blow was struck among the Illltten and the Beni-Tourash, when the Beni-Hidger omne trembling to implore the aman of General Macmahon to the great displeasure of 4,000 or 5,000 men, contingents of our new allies,who only waited thesignal to rush on them, our soldiers on returningto their bivouass sung in chorus, 'There now remain for us only the Beni-Fini.' blarhal Randon raised his camp at Temesguida on the 15th, and took the road to Port Napoleon. Some days previously we had before us a hostile popolation, who received us on our passage with musket shots. Four years ago it was still worse: aU1 the contingents of these warlike tribes, beaten but not subdued, regarded us with a furious eye, like chained tigers, as if they said 'Go, bnt you shall not return.' Iow all that Is now changed! Every where a population without arms crowded round us on our passage, offering for sale their muskets, their jewels, or their fruit, and appearing to regret all the advantages of which they would be drprived by our departure. In aUl the villages men, women, and children regarded us as we passed without fear, as we in our towns go to see a regiment march past after a zoview. In the fields everybody is occupied in gathering the relics of the harvest, which war had spared, or were driving their flocks, which traversed our columns as though some days previously they had not been left to wander in the mountains. The Marshal spent one day at Souk-d-Arba to the inspection of the works of Fort Napoleon, which General Dupuis has directed with extra. ordinary skill. Incessant activity prevails there. Everything advances with magiccelerity. We had left a desert audwe find a town. Everybody acts, labours, and appears to comprehend the importance of the rising fort to our new conquest. On the 17th we took leave of this first establishment, which is a durable movement of our conquest. The Marshal, leavlng behind him General Jusuf's division, took, without an escort and almost lalone with his staff, his way to Dellys, along a magnificent road which was finished in 17 days, and is the meet marvellous work ever accomplished by an army. We who saw it begun and completed, we who quitted it scarcely a month since, we can scarcely believe in the reality of this result. The heavy rains and the trafEc have not in theleast damaged it. The ground is firm, resisting, and in exceUeat condition. There is movement between Tizi-Oazou and Souk-el-Arba. Carriages, horsemen, infantry, merchants, travellers, French, Kabyles, come and go, one might imagine one's self at the entrance of a great city. Organized military posts watch over the security of the public roads at stated distances, and the Kabyles, who compose them, rise at the approach of the Governor-General to pay him the military honours due to his rank. All this is the work of two months, the result of a v ise administration. On the arrival of the Marshal at Algiers the enthusiasm of the population was great and in proportion to the immense results obtained by the campaign, for I repeat we have through the Marshal completely conqaered Kabylia-we have conquered it quietly and methodically. Foresight, wise preparation, perfect arrangement in the movement of the troops-all con. tributed to our success-a success of which the consequencesare incalcrlable. ' We have manceavred wel said the soldier, who well understood the Marshal and who assodated himself with aU his heart in his success. The resistance of the Kabyles, it must be confessed, was obstinate. but it was overcomue by the energy of the troops. It could not be otherwise. They were the soldiers of the Crimea and of Malakhoff. Erance may now speak from the top of the Djjendlena, and say with pride, 'I see all Algeria at my feet-the French flag floats triumphantly everywhere.' General Deligny is going on well: his wound is healing." The Paris papers publish the following telegraphic despatches: "d MARSEThLES, JuLy 26. "The Indian mail is expected here to-morrow. "Advices frora Naples have been received to the 23d inst. The trial continues. None of the prisoners have asyet been shot. Nicotera has revealed the whole plot. He has justified the conduct of the crew of the Cagliari. Some of the papers found on Pisacane are in cipher, and have not been made out. " Foschini, the refugee, who escaped from London after committing a double assasination, is among the wounded. Padula has blown his brains out. " A conflict has taken place between some of the inhabitants of Torre del Greco and the crew of the French ship Mtiore. The sailors were occupied in making hydrographiosL observations, when they were attacked by the Neapolitans, who thought they intended to effect a landing for revolutionary purposes. The l-ing has ordered apologies to be made to the officers of the MWtCore. " The King of Naples hs gone to reside at Castelamare. with his three sons. " BERBLIUT, JuLY 25. "The Dowager Empress of Russia leaves this on Thursday next. The Emperorhas arrived here; he will only re. main four days, but returns in Septemaber, when he will sojourn at Berlin for some weeks. " To-morrow there will be a grand militaryflIte at Potsd%m." PRUSSIA. (Fmo0 OUn OWN COsutSPONDEmer.) BERLIN, JuLY 25. Accordingtotelegraphlc advices receivedhere from Copenhagen, the Danish Government has convoked the Holstein Estates to meet in an Extraordinary Diet on the 16th of next month; this is the first step towards the fulfilment of the promises recently made by the present Danish Cabinet with a view to staving off the evil day, which nevertheless will, sooner or later, inevitably come, and briug with it a collision between Denmark and Germany. The two German Powers have come to an understanding between themselves to await the convocation of the Holstein Estates, the publication on the part of the Danish Government of the amount of liberty of deliberation it intends to accord to them, and the use they make of it) before they take any fn-ther step, and the German Federal Diet at Frankfort accordingly resolved in last Thursday's sitting to adjourn tiU the middle of October. The approaching manceuvres of the Danish troops in Holstein, which only a little time back were to have been made an excuse for introducing a considerable additional number of Danish troops into that Duchy, are now to be confined to the 7,000 Danish military at prezent stationed there; but there is no talk at all of the Holstein troops being brought back from Copenhagen and its neighbourhood to do duty nearer home. It is said that Prince Frederick of Hesse, who married the Princess Anna of Prussia, and has hitherto lived in Copenhagen, being nearly related to the Danish Royal family, is about to take up his residence in Berlin. The contents of the successive Indian mails are read here with great interest and sympathy, and the debates iu Parliament are followed up with all the more avidity that there is such a total want of movement in German politics; more especially are men here looking with anxiety to the results of the petitions being got up just now in the city of London for the redemption of the Stade Toll, that being a subject in which parties trading with the Elbe have a direct interest. It is understood that our Government has recently taken up the matter with a determination to put a stop to the further continuation of this obstraction to our trade with the north of Germany, for which course the receutredemption of theSound Dues offers a striking precedent. If emulation can be supposed to be a motive of which a Government can be susceptible, there would be ample food for it on the part of our Government in the matter of the Stade ToiI furnished by the activity of the Government of the TJnited States, which, flushed by its recent success in having brought about the redemption of the Sound Dues, that had Fe long been bolstered up by the Governments of the Old World, is now actively engaged in preparatory measures for bringing it to a close. The amount of unwillingneBs and delicacy s long felt by our Government in meddling with this irripoat, which former English Governmsoi had first laid ou the cormerce of the Elbe,, when Enaover waa an English dependency, Jim. jrpbably bpea pea~ly diminished of late by finding that this Stade TloU does not form part of the King of Hanover's private income, as was for a long time supposed, but consti. tutes part of the State revenue, and consequently is a fair subject for diplomatie negotiation with a view to redemption or commutation. The King's health may be looked on as completelY restored, and he now not only bears his full share in the fatigue of Court ceremony, which the presence of the Dowager-Empress of Russia imposes on the Court at Potsdam, but also punctually transcts alt State business that necessity requires. According to the last travelling arrangements made by the Empress, she will leave Stettin on the 30th inst., and return direct to St. Petersburg by water, but it is just as likely as not that my next letter may announce some change as having been made in them The Emperor is to arrive here in the course of to. night. The Royal carriage which is to bring him hither was despatched yesterday hence to Weimar, at which Court, in common with a number of other smaller German Courts, he has just paid a visit. On Monday there is to be a review in Potsdam, in which the regiment of Prussian Lancers of which the Emperor is chef wiU take part. The day before yesterday the Russian war steamers Olaff, Grosinstschi, and Rurik, which are to convey the Emperor, the Empress-Mother, and the Grand Duke Michael back to St. Petersburg, arrived at Swineminde in the face of a stormy west wind. In this work of Imperial conveyance they will be assisted by the steam frigate Gremiastechi, wbich has been lying there for some little time past at anchor. ITALY. A letter from Florence, of the 20th inst., states that on Thursday afternoon, the 16th instant, the Hereditary Prince, who was driving in his carriage outside the town, was saluted with cries of " Long live the Constitutional Prince !" His Royal Highness took no notice, and continued his drive. It was then determined by the Constitutional party to make a great " demonstration" on the 18th, and to call for the Prince and the National Guard. The Government, being apprised of their intention, issued a proclamation forbidding any demonstration whatever. The 18th consequently passed over quietly, and the town has not since been disturbed, but commercial transactions are saspended. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES. (MOM ovn OWN COnRREsONDrs.) Wind S.W.

FBABOB. (nolx OU OWN COIB3rODq-n@-.) I PARIS, SATUAY, JULY 25. The following i5 a copy of a document found at |Genoa among the papers of the lateColonelPiacaue, the chief of the last insurrection in Calabria. It is endorsed" This is my political will," and is dated Genoa, June 24, 1857:- "At tho moment that I am about to risk my life in a rash undertaking I wish to make known my opinions to 1he country in order to combat the cjitielmms of the vulgar, ever disposed to applaud tho victors and to execto the vanquished. My political opinions are su'diclently known-I believe in socialism, but in a different socialism from the French systems, aUl more or less founded on the monarchical and despotic idea which prevails in the nation. The socialism to which I allude may be cotnprised in the two words 'liberty' and ' ssociation.' I have developed this opinion in two volumes which I composed-the fruit of nearly six years' study, and to which, for want of tine, I have not been able to give the last tonch as regards style and diction. If some one of my friends would replace me and publish these two volumes, I would be ex. tremely grateful to him. I aid convineed that railways, electric telegraphs, machinery, improvements !n manufactures-in fact, all that developes and facilitates commerce, Is destined by an inevitable law to impoverish the mass of the people until a division of the profits is made by competition. All these means increase production, but they accumnlato them in a small number of hands, from which it re. sults that this so much vaunted progre3s is, in fact, only decadence. If these pretended ameliorations are regarded as a progress it will be in this sense-that by increasing the misery of the people they wi infallibly impel them to a terrible revolution, which, by changing social order, wiUl turn to the advantage of all that which now serves for the profit of a few. I am convinced that Italy will become great by liberty, or will be a slave. I am convinced that temperate remedies such as the constitntional system in Piedmont and the progesive improvements granted to Lombardy, far from advancing the regeneration of Italy, can only retard it As for myself, Iwould not make the smallest sacrifice to change a Ministry or to obtain sa constitutionnot even to drive the Austrians ont of Lombardy and to unite that provinoe to the kingdom of Sardinia, In my opinion the domination of the house of Savoy and the domination of the House of Austria are precisely the sanae thing. I believe likewime that the oonstitutional system in Piedmont is morel injurious to Italy than the tyranny of Ferdinand IL I believe firmly that if Piedmont had been governed in the same manner as the other States of Italy the revoln. tion of Italy would have been effected at the present day. This, my decided opinion, arises from the profound conviction I entertain that the propagation of an idea is a chimera -that the instruction of a people is an absurdity. Ideas are derived from facts and not facts from ideas, and s nation will not be free because it is educated, but it wil very soon become educated when it shall be free. The only act a citizen can perform in order to be useful to his country is to wait patiently for an opportunity to co-operate in a material revolution. Conspiracies, plots, attempts at insurrection are, in my opinion, the series of facts through which Italy is moving towards her objectm-unity. The intervention of bayonets in Milan produced a much more efficacious propaganda than a thousand volumes written by the Doctrinaires, who are the real plague of our country and of the entire world. There are persons who say the revolution ought to be made by the country. That is incontestable; but the country is composed of individuals and if all of us waited peaceably for the day of the revolution without preparing it by a conspiracy the revolution would neverbreakout. If, on thecontrary, everybody said, 'Therevo lution ought to be made by the country, and as I am an infni. tesimal part of the country, I have myself an infinitesimalpart of duty to fulfil, and if I fulfil it the revolution willbeimme. diately accomplished,' it will be invincible, because it will be immense. One may not be agreed on the form of a conspiracy, on the place and time when a conspiracy ought to be accomplished ; but not to be agreed on the principle Is an absurdity, an act of hypocrisy, anda manner of concealing the basest egotism. I esteem theman who approves a conspiracy but does not conspire himself, but I despise those who not only will not act, but who find pleasure in blaming and in execrating those who do act. With my principles I would have thought I had omitted a sacred duty if, seeing the possibility of attempting a surprise on a well-chosen point and under favourablecircumstances, I had not employed all my energy in executing it, and in bringing it to a successful conclusion. I do n,otpretend to be the saviourof my country, though many idlers, for their own justification, have accused me of so pretending. No; but I am convinced that amoral insurrection exists in the south of Italy, that an energetic impulse might drive the population to attempt a decisive movement, and it is for that reason my efforts are employed to accomplish a conspiracy which will give this impulse. If I arrive at the place of landing, which will be Sapri, I will consider I have gained a great personal success, should I afterwards die on the scaffold. A simple individual though I am, supported by a great number of generous men, I can do more, and it I do so the rest will depend on the country and not on me. I have only my life to sacrifice for such an object, and I hesitate not to do it. I am convinced that if the enterprise succeed I shall obtain universal applause. If I fail the public will blame me. I shall be called silly, ambitious, turbulent; and those who, never acting themselves, pass their lives in criticizing others will minutely examine the enterprise will expose my errors, and will accuse me of having failed through want of intellect, courage, and energy. Let those detractorsmknow that I consider them not only incapable of doing what I have attempted, but even of conceiving the idea of it. To those who wvll say that the enterprise was impossible I will reply that if it were necessary to obtain the approbation of the world previous to the undertaking of similar enterprises they should be altogether renounced. The world never approves beforehand any but vulgar plans. The man was called mad who first trled a steamboat in America, and the impossibilityvwas subsequently demonstrated by crossing the Atlantic with such boats. Our Columbus was a madman before he discovered America, and the vulgar would have called Hannibal and Napoleon madmen had they succumbed, the one at Trebia, and the other at Marengo. I do not pretend to compare my undertaking with that of those great men. It resembles theirs, however, in one point of view, for it will be the object of universal disapprobation if I fail, and of the admiration of the world if I succeed. If Napoleon, before he quitted E lba to land at Frejus with 50 Grenadiers, had asked advice, his plan would have been unanimously blamed. Napoleon had what I have not, the prestige of his name; but I rally round my ilg all the affections and all the hopes of the Italian revolutionists. All the griefs and all the miseries of Italy will fight on my side. I have but one word more to say. If I do not succeed I profoundly despise the ignoble vulgar who will condemn me. If I succeed I willvery lttle appreciate their applause. I will find my reward in my conscience and in the approbation of those dear and generous friends who afforded me their assistance, and who participated in the beating of my heart and in mny hopes. Should our sacrifice produce no advantage to Italy, it will nevertheless be a glory for her to have produced children who desired to sacrifice themselves for her fature prosperity " CHARLES PISACANE." The Civil Tribunal of the Seine yesterday gave judgment in the case of the Menwirs of tlte Duke de Bagusa, inwhich the descendantsof PrinceEugbne de Beauharnais brought an action against M. Perrotin for publishing statements in that work highly injurious to the Prince'smemory,and quite unfounded in truth. The Court decided that the plaintiffs had fully proved their case, and ordered Perrotin to insert in all the copies of the sixth volume which he had on hand the 33 documents brought forward by the plaintiffs in support of their complaint.

AMERICA. LWVERPOOL. JULY 26. The British and North American Royal mail ateamship Niagara, Whitman, commander, has arrived from Boston, vid Halifax, bringing dates from New York to the 14th and by telegraph to the 16th inst. She has $306,867 in specie on freight, and 109 passengers. The United States' mail steamship Arago from Bremen, and the screw steamship City of 3Manchester, hence, arrived at New York on the 13th and 14th inst. respectively. The Canadian Screw Steamship Company's Royal mail steam%hip Anglo-Saxon, hence, arrived at Quebec on the 31th inst. The Niagara passed the Royal Mail steamship America on the 16th inst. between Halifax and Boston. Advices from Washington in the N?ew York Herald confirm the probability of a satisfactory arrangement of the differences with New Granada. It is said that General Herran, the representative of that Power, has received from General Ospima, the new President, instructions to that effect. The nomination of Colonel Cummings as Governor of Utah and the other appointments for the territory had been completed. Civil war appeared to be raging in New York. On the afternoon of the 14th the rioters of the 14th ward were making extensive preparations for a renewal of the conflict. An incendiary handbitl was circulating, calling a mass meeting to put down the metropolitan police. A meeting had also been held at the German Theatre, in Fourth-street, to make arrangementsfor the attack. The rioters are reported to have a field-piece and plenty of muskets and ammunition. The Police Commissioners were preparing for them at all points, and three regiments hadbeen ordered toreportthemselves at their armouries. The State Lunatic Asylum, Utica, N. Y., had been partially destroyed by fire. None of the inmates were injured. The damage was estimated at $200,000. The steamship Star of the West, from Aspinwall, had arrived at New York with date3 from San Francisco to the 20th of June, and $1,521,678 in treasure on freight. The news is unimportant. Quartz mining, enterprises are reported as resulting more favourably. 'rhe crops throughout the State were more promising than was anticipated. The United States' surveying party had left for Paget Sound for the purpose of settling the boundary line between Washington territory and the English possessions. The mining precinct of Drytown, Amador county, had been almost totally destroyed by fire. The inteligence of Walker's final expulsion from Nicaragua had been received with general satisfaction. Business was unprecedentedly dulL Money was scarce, and the failure of two large jobbing housers had created distrust. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company's steamer Golden Age left San Francisco on the 20th ult. with the United Statese mails, passengers, and 41,973,037 in treasure, destined as follows :-New York, $l,6U,656 16c.; Panama, $12,011; and England, $449,369 91c. General Lane had been elected delegate to Congress from Oregon. The Indians on the Umpqua reservation, having become disaffected, had broken out, and, at last accounts, were on their way to Port Oxford, where the inhabitants were arming themselves to give the savages a warm reception. Walker, the Filibuster, arrived at New Orleans on the evening of the 14th inst. At Montreal, on the 14th inst., a fire had occurred at Douglas Brothers' saw-mills, and destroyed $30,000 worth of property. At and previous to the fire some Orangemen and Catholics commenced a riot, and several parties were imprisoned. Captain Rudolf, of the ill-fated steamer Montreal, by the burning of which so many lives were lost, had been arrested at Qaebec on a coroner's inquest. The steamship Empire City had arrived at New York with dates from Havannah to the 9th inst. The Spanish war vessels in port had been ordered on a cruise. Upon the information of the English Consul, General Concha had ordered the arrest ot some merchants in Puerto Principe on a charge of landing slaves. There was no news of General Santa Anna. Sugars were firm. The stock of molasses light. The stock of sugar in Havaunah and Matanzas was 5,000 hogsheads and 325,000 boxes. The .New York Reralds correspondent at Sagna la Grande writes *- *" Two barks fromn the West Coast of Africa succeeded in landing off this place, on the night of the 24th inst., 950 slaves, and both vessels were under canvass the following morning before sunrise for BraziL The British Consul forwarded a letter stating the occurrences to the Governor of Jamaica, who has ordered a British figate to go in parsuit of the slavers." From Vera Cruz the dates are to the 7th inst., and from Mexico to the 3d inst. The local elections had generally resulted in favour of the Government. From Vera Cruz it is reported that the summary punishment inflicted on the Santa Anna conspirator in the capital had had agood effect. PresidentComonfort's taxes on tobacco and cigars had produced some popular irritation. Extensive depredations had been committed by the Indiana at Cerro Gordo. At Bajaco the locusts had destroyed most of the crops. The sum of $2,246,59S had arrived in Vera Cruz under Government escort. The health of the city was good. In Honduras great rejoicing had taken place on the capitulation of Valker. The Legislature had repealed the law abolishing capital punishment. In the San Salvador Legislature the expulsion of one of the deputies favourable to Walker had been demanded. Eer Majestys ships Esk and Pearl are reported as having touched at the Sandwich Islands, on their way to China. Advices from Valparaiso are to the 31st of MIay, and from Callao to the 12th ultimo. In Chili the political trials were drawing to a close, and it was thought the prisoners would be put to death. Congrens was to meet on the 1st of June, but nothing had transpired respecting the ideas contained in the President's annual message. A Government loan of $4,000,000 was to be taken up for the purpose of completiog the Santiago and Valparaiso Railroad. In Valparaiso the Peru-ian Consul made an attempt to confiscate all 'he guano shipped under Vivanco's decree. The merchants of that city had proposed a new project for regulating the supply of guano to President Castilla. In Peru, a treaty had been concluded at Lima, having for its object the protection of the Chincha, Lobos, and other islands, by an armed force of the En,,lish and French, for the term of 10 years. The Government of Peru was to control the guano trade as before. This arrangement was intended as a sort of collateral security to the bondholders of London and Paris. General Vivanco had sailed for Isla, and immediately after an English steamer arrived at the Chinchas with Peruvian commissioners, who negotiated a return of the revolutionary war siaps to Castilla's service. Vivauco still held out at Arequipa, but the town was surrounded by about 3900( Government troops under General San Ramon. Trade in Valparaisol was unusually dull, exportation of agricultural products trifling, and the scarcity of silver currency much felt. Advices from Bermuda reporb disturbances at Dominica arising oult of public- dissatisfaetion at the legislation on the subject of the run dutyb; the Governor,had been requested to dissolve the kAs- sembly, but declined, riots ensued, and sone blood was spilt. In Grenada a coloured- man had been elected by the House of Assembly. Ab St. Vimcent's the cane crop already reaped reached 10,000 hogsheads. At Jamaicathe rports izom th2emine were satisfactory. The local papers praised the Emperor Napoleon's contract for the supply of Afris:ans for Mlartiniue,'and recomm ended England tofollo the example. at New York, on the. 13t inst., the inquiry for money was not quite soautive, but the rates were higher than sual foithe season of the year. Of prime paper there was a good supply at 8 to 9 per cent.; well-known, naTnea 9 to 10 per cent.; and zecond-class bills were. passed with difficulty at 12 to 15 per cent. Priees of stocks were generally higher, and thens.w'us a strong feeling shown to sustain them. Fcor4ign exchanges were dull at the following ratea,a:-London, 109i to 109i; Paris, 5f. 15c. to 5f.

The whole of the speakers without exception displayed much eloquence and rhetorical skill, particularly Mr. Cleasby, lIr Mott ma., and Mr. Stanley, who were highly and deservedly applauded. At 3 o'clock the grand banquet took place in the ancilent hall of the College, the antique tapestry beinR displayed on. the wallg, and the beautifl silver rnodel of the College, presented by King William IV., exhibited on the centre table with the College plate.

After dinner the loving cup wassentround, and the grace, postp 'ndium, chanted, when the company retired to the election chamber, where they partook of an elegant demsert, and drank the usual loyal and collegiate toasts, including that of the "Is. mortal memory of the pious founder.". At 7 o'clock, the company having repaired to the Brocas, the boats were manned by their respective crews, who, after pulling to Windsor-bridge, left for Surley-hall in the fol! owing order: The Eton eight selected to row the WestminsterBaring (captain), Lubbock, Hankey, Ron.

The dis- play of 1revorks by M. Coton, which followed while thes roat3 rowed before the spectators, was of a more splendil character than usual. Shortly after 10 o'clock the band played the National Anthem and the boys returned to the College.
THE LATE CoLLusIoX Ow Tm Gr.AT zVESTEra RAiLvAy.-The switchman, whose negligence in not turning the points caused the collision of two trains near Cheltenham, as reported in The 2lmes of l3onday last, has been taken before the magistrates on tbo charge of neglect of duty. Th case occupied the magistrates some hours. It transpired that on the departure of the express traln from Chelteniham station for London> at theo regulE time nriday evening, the accused, whose mne is Sidney Fronch, and who has a medal for servioes rendered in the Crimea, reported to the station-master "all rig&t." The train wasa conseonently started, but had not proceeded far from the statiou, when the guard noticed that it was running on tothe down line. He conseqWntly blew his whistle and applled the break, but the down third-class train was, so close that a collision took place. Mr. Beale. Browne, a county magistrate, was examined as a witnes&. He had arrived on the platform just as the train ws starting and kad jamped into the guar's box. Re had scarcely been seztedl when the alarsi whiste soundod, and the guara directly attended to the " breakh' and used it with all his. power. Mr. Brown thrsw himself down, and felt an immediote shock. He considered th&t he owed his preservatiol to the guard, from the vromptitude he had shown in attend. iag to the break. B2very attentionx was dsown to the, passengers by the company s officers after the collision. The, prisoner baa to attend to nine pairs of switches in the course. ef the day, and to ring a bell at the further end of the. station at two intervals shortly befoze the departure of each train. He had delegated the duty of turning tho switches on this day to another man, who lad neglected them.- No self-acting switches are used here, which, it was contended on behalf of the prisoner, ought to e employei.

LAW REPORT. COURT OF CHANCERY, LcoMt'sMM. JULy 25. RE SUITORS lw A V lBefore tae L]ORD CIHANA:T.T-R I Afr. B M"SUAW apP Drea in support of a petition to have a fresh receiverappointed of the compensation fund awarded to the Earl of Devosi on'the abolition of a patent office fornierly held by him in the Court of Chancery. The application was made on behalf of the Globe Insurance Compsny, who are first efneumbrancers on the fund.' Mr. Elderton, Mr. Southgate and another learned gentleman appeared for subsequent mortgagees, and offered no opposition. The LORD CHAWCBLLOR made the order as asked, without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties. L1UDLOW V. STEVMNTSON. This was an appeal from a decree of Vice-ChanceDor Wood, and turned upon the construction of a clause In the wiU of W. F. Stevenson, dated 1848. The testator had four children, three sons and one daughter, and, after providing in the first instance for his sons and their iamilies by means of aninuities charged upon his estate, the will proceeded in the following manner:-'I give to my danghtor Harrieb all my books, plate, linen, china, and wearing apparel, watehes, jewels, and money, except any money in the funds or placed on security, and all other l?roperty not otherwise disposed of, for her sole and exclusive use." The will then went on to direct that after the death of the last of the annuitants the whole of the testator's property should be invested in Government securitios and transferred in equai fourth shares to " the President and Council of the Royal Society," -the President and Felows of the Antiquarian Society," "1 the Association in London for the Relief of Destitution," and " the Trustees of the Association for the Relief of the Houseless Poor," and the dividends applied to the purposes of such societies. It appeared that the testator left property to the amount of 140,0001., a part of which at the time of his death was invested in foreign funds, Exchequer-bills, &c., and the main question raised by the suit was whether this portion of the testator's property passed to his daughter Harriet under the word " money" in the above-mentloned clause of his will. The Vice. Chancelor held that the word "money" must be taken in its strict legal meaning, and could not there. fore be held to inolude " stooks or shares." His Honour's decision was, that there was an immediate gift to the four societies, subject to the fund remaining in its present state until the death of the last annuitant, and then to be in. vested in Government securlties and transferred for the benefit of the different societies. It was now contended on behalf of the daughter, the appellant, that all the testator's property passed to her, except that portion which the claus9 in express terms excluded. Mr. Willeock and Mr. Waley appeared for the appellant; Mr. W. D. Lewis for persons in the same interest- Mr. Daniel and Mr. Amphlett for the Royal Society; Z. W. M. James and Mr. Dickinson for the Antiquarian Society; blr Cairns and hlr. Bovil for the Association for the Relief of the Houseless Poor; Mr. Kenyon for the Sooiety for the Relief of Destitution; Mr. C. Barber for the administrator de ioois non; and Mr. Wickens for the Crown. The LoRxD CHANICELLOR, in giving j udgment, said he regretted that the testator, having a family of four children with whom he lived on terms of amity, should have made ro apparently unreasonable a distribution of his property. With that, however, the Court had nothing to do, its duty consisting solely in giving effect to the testator's intention expressed in his will. Now, it appeared clear that the testator by the word " money" meant merely money in the house or in his purse, and it was clear to demonstration that by the wrords "property not otherwise disposed of" he could not mean property cjusdem genieris with the preceding para6raph of the clause. Under these circumstances his Lordship felt himself hound, though with great regret, to come to the same conclusion as the Vice-Chancellor, and to hold that the property was divisible into four parts, to be held for the bonefit of the different societies.
VICE-CHANCELLOR'S COIUR'r. SATURDAY. JTTLY 2i. IN RE BENDYSHE,- {(eBfre ViCeC C7anCCeor SBi R. T. KisND=ILEy.) -1-ms case was argued. on the A1151 of J une last, and reported in The Times, when his Honour reserved his decision. The case involves the important question, under what circumstances a trustee is entitled to pay into court a fund to which a married womau is entitled m her own right, and, as dependent upon that question, whether a trustee is or is not hable to pay tho costs of adopting such a course X It appeared that a gentleman named Bendyshe, by his will, left to his daughter, then Susannah Bendyshe, a sum of 4,0001. charged upon certain property, whoh was vested in trustees, and of which his eldest son, Captain Bendyshe, was then devisee, subject to such charge. Subsequently to tho date of the will, Susannah Bendyshe married the Rev. William Crowther. The testator then communicated with his solictor upon the subject of altering his will, in consequence of his daughter's marriae; but ill-health and other oircumstances prevented suoh alteration taking place, and he died, leaving the gift in stati quo. A correspondence then took place between C0otain Blendyshe and Mr. Crowther and their respective solictors, as also between Mr. Townley (the surviving trustee of the term for raising the 4,0001.) and Mrs. Crowther, and the effect of that correspondence was that, whereas Mr. Crowther at first fuly agreed to the usual settlement being made, there being subsequently some difficulty about the appointment of trustees of the preposed settlement, whach was in draught and agreed to, .nCor her refused t carry it intoCeect, claiming the right to nake such settlements as he thought ft, and Mrs. Orowther concurred in that view; thero boing aTo a question whether the 4,0001. should be placed in the fends which Mr. Crowthor objected tou or in Governmont or real securities, as proposed by the settlement; and the trustee paid the fund into court, after notice fron the solicitor acting for MIrs. Crowther's family of the intention to do so. Under these circumstances the questions were, whether there was such a binding contract for a settlement as could be enforced against hlr. and Mirs. Crowthes,, and whether Mr. Townley ought to pay the costs of and consequent to paying the fends into court ? The usual petition had been prosented by Mr. and Jrs. Crowther, praying for payment out of the fund to them, a,nd for payment of the costs by the trustee, raising the above questions. It appeared thab since the presentation of that petition rrs. Crowther had been examined by commis- iion, and had consented to payment of the fund to her husband, and her. signature was attested by her solicitor. She had also been cross-examined on her affidavit on the petition. Mir. Glasse ahid Mr. Lisidley appeared in support of the petition; Mr. Baily and Mr. Cole opposed it. The VICE ChLaNCELLOR now recapitulated the above facts somewhat in detail, observing that it was difficult to conceive for what reasos MIr. Crowther had changed his bind with respect to making a settlement, as nothing could have been more honourable than the manner in which he had met the original proposal. The petition did not completely state the facts (not intentionally so, no doubt), and two questaons arose-namely, whether there was a contract binding on o rs. Crowther to execute a settlement, and whether Mir. Townloy ought to pay the costs? On the first point, having looked into almost all the numerous oases citod, his Honourgs opinion was th ththere was nothing in the circumstances to prevent ars. Crowther releasing herself by her censent, taken in the ordinary form, from the obligation of executing a. settlement. Upon the other guestion, teyond all doubt, if a trustee, from caprice or obstgacy, or in dereliction of his duty towards his ceslue qui trusts, paid morey into court, he ought to pay the costs of that proceeding, aud if that was the case here ir. Townley ought cortainly to pay these cots;- but upon all these circumstances it appeared to his Honour that no suich motive had - nactusated his conduct. He was dosirous of doing what was right and a settlement having been actually agreed to, could it be said that hewas guilty of oppresbion in paying the money into court? It would be very much to the detriment of married women te lay down any such rule. It was said that the case before Sir James Wigram supported that principle but, on looking at that case, it was certainly not so, and r. Townleyfwas perfectly justified in paying the money into coulrt, The affidavit upon which the commission was granted was not eorret ian stating that theo was no agreoment for a settlement, and it appeared that eirs. Crowther's signatire was attsteid by her husband's solicitor, raising the inference that he was present on the occasion of her examination before the commistioners. If e was presont the commissioners failed ln their duty; a husband's solicitor ought never to be present. It appeared, however, that hrs. Crowther had been crossexamined, and had again expressed her wish that the fund should be paid to her husband, and therefore ho should not require her toVbe examined In court, which he would otherwise have done. The costs must be paid out of the fund as between solicitor and clent. IN IRE THE LONDOb' AND COUb-TY SSRArWE COMPANY hMr. ROXaUrGte and pr.

It appoared that Dr. Braid and others had attempted to repudiate their eharacter as shareholders, and after writ Hig a letter from Manchester for that prpose, and receiving no answser, voted at a meting inu London by proxy to express, as was said, that repudiation. hlr.

Tbat had not been the case here, for these partles had actually voted by proxy at the meeting in London, and therefore, not saying a word about MIr. Stronsberg's representations, and even assuming they were false, these parties must be settled upon the list of contributories. RE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPIr COM[PANY (LRELAKD). Mtr. BAOALLAY and dMr. CorroNr appeared for two con tributories who had appealed against the Chief Clerk's decision. In. the former case the contributory, Mr. Reid, had been a shareholder, and had transferred all his shares to his son, who weas then and stillis an infant, and who had not repudiated the transfer. In the latter case the shares had been taken by the father in the namne of his SOn, who was a mninor.

SUMMER ASSIZES. MIDLAND CIRCUIT. LINCOLN, JuLY 25. CROWN COURT.--(Before Mr. Justice ERLE.1 THE CASE OF THOMAS FULLER BACON. The court was openedthis morning atll o'clock, and was soon crowded in every part, the greatest anxiety being manifested by persons of all classes to hear the tral of a man who, having been twice bef ore charged with very serious offences, first with arson, and afterwards with the murdet of his own children, was now to be arraigned upon a'charge of murdering or attempting to murder his own mothor, Owing to the absence of Dr. Taylor, who was detained at Dnrham as a witness in a nuisance case, great uncertainty existed up to tho last moment whether the grand jury would be enabled to find the bills; and, after completing the other business bro-dght beforo them, they yesterday adjourned in order to affoid time for Dr. Taylory irriviL ''Iaicinsequence of this cause of delay it was nearly 1 o'clock before they came into court and returned two bills against Bacon, one for murder, the other for administering poison with intent to murdor. Mr. MILLOR, Q.C., who (with Mr. Brower) conducted the prosecution, at once rose and, addressing the learned judge, statea that, having carefully weighed the evidence in this case, he should take upon himself the responsibility of electing to proceed, not upon the indictment for murder, but upon thati which charged the prisoner with administering poison with intent to murder. The Ilarned JUDOE said, that he was quite satisfied that the Interests of public justice were perfectly safe in M3r. delor's hand, andhe had no hesitation in allowing the course proposed. The prisoner, Thomas Fuller Bacon, aged 33, whitesmith, was then arraigned upon the second indictment returned by the grand jury, w hich charged him, in the firat count, with administeringto A4nn Bacon, at Stamford, on the 13th of May, 1855, 10 grains of white arsenic, with intent to kill and murder the said A^^nn Bacon; and, in the second count, with causing the same to be taken by the said Ann Bacon, with the like intent. The prlsoner pleaded " Not Guilty." Mr. Stephen, at the request of the learned Judgc, defended the Prisoner. Mr. -Mxnao+t, in stating the case on the part of the prosecution, observed that the heinous character of the offenco with which the prisoner was charged would insure their careful attention to the evidence which would be presented in support of It, and he need hardly remind them that uon that evidence alone, dismissing all other consideratons, they must judge df the guilt or innocence of the acused. The deceased Ann Bacon, the prisoner's own mother, was 63 years of age at the time of her death. She lived in Stamford, at a very short distance from the prisoner and his wife. On the 12th of May, 18.55, she was in her ususl state of health, and on the following day Scnday, the 13th, she dined with the prisoner. During the dinner she was seized with sickness, and she suffered very much all that afternoon from vomiting and purging, accomnpanied with pain and thirst. Her doctor, Mr. Barber, was sent for, and she was removed to her own house. On the Monday morning she was better and continued to improve during the whole of that day, but on the Tuesday night she becamo much worse, fresh symptoms set in; she was unconscious on the Tuesday, and in the evening of that day she dlied. It was right to state that during that illness the prisoner was constant in his attend. ance upon hei, and behaved apparently as a son should. At the same time, from expressions used by him at the time, it appeared that he eonfidently anticipated her death, and in the counrse of her illness he had been observed to administer something to his mother out of a small square bottle, which was not one of these sent by the doctor, and which he himself took away after her death. He (Mr. Mellor) did not, however, attribute much importance to that circumstance, becau6e,looking at the other evidenco in the case, the jury would ptobably be of opinion that the real cause of the ilness of the deceased was something which she took at the prisoner's houso on. the Sanda:F. -He was- farfrom saying that some subsequenb doses might not havebeen given to her; but he. thought that the jury would fSd that that Sunday, thel13th of May, was the material time to which they should direct their particular attention. It was true that after that Sunday the deceased got better, and a change in the symptoms took place before her death, not inconsistent with the administration of arsenic, but so far con. sistent with other causes that the medical men were not quite prepared to say that her death was occasioned by arsenic; andlit was on that account that he had, with the sanction of; the learned judge, elected to proceed upon the present charge instead of that of murder. Indeed, at the time of the death no suspicion was excited, and it was supposed that the deceased had died of some nataral disease. It was not until circumstances of a more recent occurrence had occasioned an order to be issued for the exhumation of the body that the real circumstances of the case had become known; but when the body was exhumed and carefully examined, and certain portions subjected to chynical analysis, then, even after the body had been buried nearly two years, about three-quarters of a grain of white arsenic was discovered in the body; and the medical testimony would establish beyond a doabt that not only had arsonic been taken by the deceased in her lifetimebut that it must have been taken recently beforo death. Then arose the serious question, by whom was that arsenic administered? Thedeceased was taken ill at the house of the prisoner immediately after dining there. She was the owner of some small houses, of which she was in the habit of collecting the rents for herself; but on the Monday the prisoner took possession of the rentbook; and it ap- eared that he expected to become entitled to the estate on ter death. He (Mr. Melor) believed that, in fact, the mother had made a testamentary disposition, dividing the property among the family in some way; but that which was most material to the present investigation was the prisoner's expectation on the subject, as supplying some sort of motive for the commissioa of thishorriblecrime. But it would be naturaUy asked whether the prisoner could be shown to have had any arsenic in his possession, and upon that subject very im. portaist evidence would be adduced. It would be proved that only just a week before his mother's death the prisoner had sent his apprentice to purchase arsenio,telling him to say at the chymist's that it was wanted for the purpose of hardening iron, a purpose to which ib would appear that arsenio was inapplicable. The druggist refused to let the apprentice have it, and the prisoner being told of that said, " Then I'll get it myself." Accordingly, on the Sth of May he went to another chymist's and there bought an ounce of arsenic, which he said he wanted to poison rats in his cellar. These were the facts of the case; and it was for the jury to say whether these facts were suf-ficient to satisfy them that the charge was made out against the prisoner. Their responsibility was great; but if they acted upon their OffnU conscientious convictions in giving their verdIct they would have discharged their duty, what. ever might be the result. The following witnesses were then examined: Ann Bacon, the wife of William Bacon.-I live at Staunford. My husband is prisoner's brother. In May, 1855, I lived at beterhill. in Stamford. I knew the deceased very well. She lived about five minutes' walk from us. I saw her on Saturday previous to her death atherown house. Ihad conversation with her. She appeared quite well. I believe she was 63. On Sunday evening, May 13, about 7 o'clock, I was sent for to go to Mrs. Bacon's house. We were accustomed to send our apprentice to shut op her house for her, and whea he retarned he said showas seriouslyi ilandwished to sae me. I then went to her house immediately. I met the prisoner in the house. I found him in the flirst room I came to. I asked himi how his mother was. He said she was very seriously ilL He said she was taken ill at his house. I went up and saw Ann Bacon. She was ill in bed. The prisoner followed me shortly afterwards. I had conversation with the deceased. I asked her how she was taken ilL She said fhe was taked ill while she was having some broth, sit*ing at dinner. She said that there wassome broth being prepared for the little boy's dinner, and she wished to have some. She said she was taken with violent sickness and purging, until she was removed to her own home about. in the evening. I remained with her till 10 that night. She was twice seik in my presence. I did not notice what she thre vup. She complained of pain and thirst. She was feverish. Before I left I gave her a draught from Mr. Barber. I made some batley-water and sent her. She said the dinner was immediately after church, and that would be about 1 o'clock. The prisoner'a wife was there also during the Sunday evening, The deceased kept no servant, but she was accustomed to have a woman come in to do her work in the morning. Her name was Riley. On Monday mornin between 6 and 7, I went agaiu to deceased. I found the prisoner there. I think Mrs. Riley was in the house, bat not in the bedroom. The deceased was very ill not- so weD I think, as on Sanday night. I zemained with MrsBacon all day. She was very ill until about 12 in the morning, after that she became, comparatively speaking, well., She got so much better that we thought in the mornin she would get up well. She sat up inrbed and took her tea., She was very cheerfuL The purtiag and vomiting had ceased. I remained till 9 that evening. The prisoner and his wife came to see her during the day. My husband was out of town in the day, but he came to see her morning and evening. The prisoner was there very fre uently. Medicios fronm Mr Barber were gien to her during the day. S ometimes I gave them, sometime>s the prisoner. When I left on Mondy night the priloner was there. -I am not sure wetber his wife wsa. *rs. Blalso was left in charge of deceased for the night. Near 7 on Tuesd'ay miorning, as7 I wras on myroad to her house, I met Mtrs. Bilcy ceming for me.. I en on ~and found Mrs. Bacon veryill., She appeased very stif and in great pain., The prisoner came to the bedroom about the same time as mnyself. My husband came in directy after. I asked her how she was. Sho aid Cale had bad a bad night; she was very ill, and could not tell what was the matter with her. About 8 o'clock on Tuesday morning she became unconscious, and remained so durng the day. I remained with her till she died, about n1 o'clocg on Tuesday night. She was in great pain in the body and legs; she was quite stiff all day on TugQaday. Mr. Barber, the surgeon, was sent for, and camo. Once, when I was about to leave the bedroom on Monday, I think the prisoner spoke to his wife, and turned to a bottle on the dressing. table, saying be thought his mother had better have somethinsE out of that bottle. I did not Eee the bottle then, but imniediately after Mrs. Bacon's death I saw the prisoner takeit, saying, "I mayaswelltakethisawa now ; itwiU be of no further use." He took it away. It was a square bottle, not an ordinaay medicinuebottle. It containedsome. thing whitish, IIght-coloured. It was light-coloured liquid; but whether thicker than water or not reannot say. rsapposed it to be peppermint. He took it from the table to which he had previously pointed. There were several bottles and glasses on the table. Cross-examined by Mr. STEPHXN.-The prisoner was a whitesmith. The prisoner's wife was about, in attendance upon the deceased. I .know she ia now a prisoner in a lunatic asylum. Mr. STEPrnnr proposed to ask the witness as to the proceedings a,ainst the prisoner and his wlef for the murder of their children. The learned JUDGE said that the evidence would not be admissible, because the witness knew nothing of those circumstances except from report. The witness, in reply to further questions said,-I learnb from the prisoner and the deceasea that the surgeon wais first called in about 5 o'clook on Sunday. Possibly the square bottle stood on the dressing-table the whole time but I never observed it. I was not in London during any proceedings against the prisoner or his wife. Mary Riley was next examined, and mid,-I knew the deceased. I was in the habit of charing for her. I was one of her tenants. She had some small houses in Protectionplace, and after her husband's death she used to collect the rents herself. On her death the prlsoner collected those rents. le collected from me. I became his tenant after his mother's death. He became the owner. He was heir to her. I remember her aeath. For some considerable time before her death I saw her daily. Her heath was never so good after an attack which sbe bad in March. The doctor then attended her about four days, btt had not attended her after that. Sho went about as usual and was cheerful, but she did not seem quite so weU s before. I wasbed for her, and saw her on the Saturday night before her death about her washing. While I was tAlking to her the prisoner came in. On Sunday evening I saw hernext. Thomas Bacon, the prisoner, fetched me. He said the old lady wastaken very ill, and he thought she would die. He wished me to go and stay with her. She was in bed when I got there; and I found the prisoner, his brother William and William's wife there. She was very ill indeed. A short time after I arrived she vomited. She vomited twice after that. She complained of herfeet being cold andbeing stiff. She had some barley-water. She said she thoughi she should like some. She did not vomit after taldng it. She got better, and had two or three hours' very comfortable rest that night. I gave her a cup of tea. She was not sick after between 10 and U o'clock. Sho made no other complaint. The prisoner went away about 10 o?clock. Willism and his wife went first. He took the key with him. He told his mother he had done so. He returned about 1 o'clock. She was awake then. He asked me how his mother was? I said I thought she was awake. I drew the curtain aside; she told him she wasbetter. He came asecond time between 3 and 4 o'clock; he told me he had not been in bed. Re stayed a short time, and cameagainbetween 5 and 6. I remained with deceased all day on Monday. She seemed to be gradnally getting better all day. I left at 9 o'clock on Monday night. Mlrs. Blake bad come before I left. Between 5 and 6 the prisoner called me up on Tueeday morning. He waited for me. When I came down he said, M My mother is a good deal worse, and I think she will die now." We left together. He went to Mr. Barber's, and I went to the deceased. I got there about 20 minutes to 6. She was a great deal worse. She told me that she wished MrBlake to go for her daughter if she was in danger. Sb.' wished to know very much whether she was in danger. I was in the house until her death. She was very feverish when I got there, and seemed rather delirious. About 11 o'clock she was put into a warm bath. I and Mrs. Blake and two or three othe-rs were there. She seemed very stiff. I thought her a little better while in the bath. When we took her out she was so stiff we could not dress her. We put her to bed again. I saw the prlsoner there from time to time during the day. He assisted in supporting her in bed several times. Mrs. W. Bacon principally attended her that day. She died at 11 o'clock on Tuesday night. The prisoner was there, but not his wife ; MIr. and Mrs. W. Bacon and one or two others were also present. The prisoner on lMonday told me he had takenthe rentbook. It was in the afternoon. He told me if I should hear any inquiries about it be had taken it, as it would be his right. On Tuesday W. Bacon was inquiring about the book, I told him Thomas had taken it. Thomas then came up, and Williar asked him if he had taken it, and he said that he had. Wi,dam said, "I would not hate taken it,", and the prisoner said, "I have taken it." The matter which sbe vomited I threw away. After her death I hid her out and put her in the coffin. In February of this year I attended at Grbat Casterton churchyard. I saw a coffin taken out of a grave there. I saw the coffin opened and the body in it. I have no doubt it was tho body of Ann Bacon. The coroner, MIr. Jackson, Dr. Taylor, and other gentlemen-were present. Cross.examined.-I paid my rent quarterly. I am not aware of any who paid weekly, but I am not sure there were not. There were 18 cottages at 51. a-year rent. AU the others paid rent to Mrs. Bacon herself, as well as L I know Mary1 Chapman was a tenant_but. I donat know whether she paid weekly. In March she had spasms and sickness. Site was very stiff also. I thought the attack when she died was quite the same as the attack in March. It had every appearance the same. Her own daughter lived at Titmarsh.! That is 26 miles from where the deceased lived. She vished to have her sent for if she was in daner. The daughtet was sentfor, but it was too late. The prisoner wrote a note for her, and William wrote also. The prisoner's manner to his mother was very kind and atteniive indeed. I can't say much as to his appearing grieved at her death. Re-examined.-I attended her when she was ill in March. The prisoner then lived at the same place. He did no, know of her illness till I told him. It was the 18th of March. By the JUDGE.-I never noticed the bottle which Mrs. Bacon spoke about at any time. Ann Bacon recalled, and examined by Mr. Ssurm.- The first time I mentioned about the bottle was when I first beard anythingsaid about Mrs. Bacon having been poisoned. The night after a fire at his house was the first time I heard any suspicon about Mbrs.Bacon's death. He was accnsed of causing the fire, and then the suspicion about Mrs. Bacon was mentioned; then I recollectedthe bottle. By the JUDGE.-It was not so high as medicine bottles usually are, and It was square. I believe it not to have been one of Mr. Barber's bottles. It was different in shape. The prisoner was extremely kind and attentive to his mother durine her illness. Elizabeth Blake, a widow, residing at Stamford.-I went to nurse the deceased on Monday night. I went between the hours of 8 and 9 in the evening. Mrs. Riley, Mrs. William Bacon, and Mrs. Cole, the prisoner's aunt, were there. She was in bed, and said she had been very ill from the day before. She complained of sickness and diarrhces. She asked me to get into bed with ber, and I did so. In about an hour after she began twitching her hands; aud two or three hours afterwards she began to twitch aU ovar violently. About 2 I gave her her medicine and some tea. She saia she felt as if she was paralyzed from head to foot. The prisoner came in about 2 in the morning; he remained about one hour, and then came again about H. He stopped about one hour again, and then went for Dr. Barber. Nobody gave her anything during the night except myseif, and I gave her only her medicine and tea. I lef' about 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning, and she was then much worse than when I went to her. Cross-examined.-I was not asleep any part of the time. The twitching was like any one convulsed. It was not like cramps. Edward Barber, surgeon at Stamford.-I have been in practice for 20 years. I attended Ann Bacon for an illness in March, 1855. She was then suffering from severe pain in the body, vomiting, and purging. I am wrong, that was not in March. Then she was suffering from cramps and spasms, and nearly unconscious. I gave her an emetic; and seeing her a few hours after she was very much relieved. She gradually recovered. I attended her about a week at that time. I next attended her in May, Sunday the 13th, at the prisoner's house. She was vomiting, and purged, and suffering from great pain in the bowels. I was fetched, I think, by theprisoner, and I was told she had been ill ever since dinner. There was some fluid on the floor. I was told she had been on the bed during the greater part of tbe afternoon. I directed her to be put to bed. I gave her an astringent and an anodyne. I visited her in the evening and gave her another anodyne pill to take at bed time. Her symptoms were then the same. Thevomiting and purging continued. Next morning she was rather better. The purging had not ceased then, but she got much better during the day, and in the evnn=h as so much bete that I withdrew the astrin. genh. About 7 o'clock on Tuesday I was called up. I found her suffering great cram psand spasms in her limbs, and her head a good deal affected. I saw her twice again that day at least, but the symptoms on Tuesday were different in cba. ricter from those of Sunday and MIonday, and more like the symptoms in MIarch. I can't recollect whether I ordered the warm bath. The last time I sawt her, in the evening sho was near her death. In the morning, about 1L I requested that her daughter should be sent for. The symptoms on Sunday and Mlonday are consistent with arsenic bad been taken on an empty stomach it would operate more quickly than on a stomach in which there was solid fosd so, if given in a fluid, it would operate more rapidily than if in anything solid. Vomiting and purging are invariable effects of taking arsenic. Its first action is to prodace vomiting. If given in a fluid state it would probably all be thrown up again. If enough were given to form a sediment there would be greater difficulty in getting rid of it from the stomach. It is a very heavy and not very soluble mineraL A sediment would, therefore, readily form. The symptoms on Tuesday are described by writers as secondary symptoms after the primary effects of arsenio have gone off. I have never seen them myself. if the patient can recover from the primary effects of arsenic, then the secondary effects are on thebrain and nervous system generally.I speak of that only from reading -it in books. According to mvnDDiniort, de-. rived from medical reading, the symptoms, of Tuesday resemble what are described AS the secondary effects of arsenic. They resembled alsovery much the aymptoms of theattack in March, whih I attributed to an ordinary 'disease of the brain. The hoepion whict I formed at the time WAas that sbe died from. aiseaseof the brain,andl foutded that opinion upon the reaembr4nb e of the two attacks, and the fact that . ln the interval she bad not been quite well. *Cross-examined.-yery early on Tuesday mornin tho symptoms changed. Tb~e symptoms of M¢arch and efasy 15 were much the same, butthee,of 8unday and Mionday werc'totatUy dtfferent. Isaw herfirst en the second oecc.io a ou oclock on Sanday. Atthetimeleonslderedit to1, symptoms were consistent with that complaint. My view of the case was that she had been ill from an attack of brain sever in Maish; that ahe had an attack of choler& on Sunday, and on Tuesday symptoms of a disease of the brain. Spasms are symptoms of English cholera. The symptoms in Mlarch resembled to some extent the secondary SymptoMs of arseuic. They could not be confounded with them, because they were not preceded by the primary symptoms. I have seen the il consequence3 Of arsenic in three or four cases, where it produced inflammation of the bowels. It was given as a medicine. If all the arsenio was thtown up I do not think there would be any secondary symptoms; but that would depend upon the degree of inflammation which had taken place. The Eecondary symptoris would appear, I should expect, within a week. Arsenioproduces constitutional results, but I do iot think that,any one having taken a dose of arsenic in March, and having an attack of EnRlish cholera in May, would be at aU likely to suffer then from the effects of the arsenic. Re-examined.-None of the bottles sent from my surgery vwere like the bottle described by Mmrs Bacon. There was no small bottle;,except one smaU draught phial. The bottles which I sent were half-pint bottles. There was no arsenical preparation which I prescribed. I did prescribe antimony. Each night she had two grains of James's powder. It isan oxide of antimonv. Mark Wilsoni Jackson, a surgeon at Stamford, and senior surgeon of the Stimford Infirmary, and 30 years in practice.-I was at Great Casterton churchyard on the 6th of February last, and saw the body of Ann Bacon. I made a -post mortemn examination. On the body being opened the omentum was loaded with fat, very firm, with a peculiar redness upon it, in a perfectly adiposerous condition. Itont hard, like soft wax or firm fat. It was in a high state of preservation, and the other contents of the abdemen down to the rectum were in much the same state, as well as the kidneys. They were so firmly united together that they could only be removed en masse from the abdomen. Thui Is a very peculiar condition in which to find the contents of the abdomen, even considering the length of time elapsed since death, but it is a condition which Dr. Christison and ether analytical chymists describe as being the effect of arsenic. The contents of the chest were examined; the lungs were decomposed; the head, neck, and extremities!. c*, the arms and legs-were also in a high state of decomposition. Those parts would not be submitted to the action of arsenic. I removed all the contents of the abdomen and part of the contents of the chest, and delivered them to Dr. Taylor. I saw them placed in a jar, sealed up, and delivered to police constable Mitchell. Bloody serum was taken from the chest, put into a bottle by Dr. Taylor, sealedup, and also given to the saani polico constable. Cross-examined.-The coffin was not broken at all There were no holes in it that I could see. I am not aware that the nature of t4e soil could have any effect upon the preservation of the internal parts of the body. Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor, lecturer on chymistry and medical jurisprudence at usS E[ospital.-I attended the exhumation of the body of Ann Bacon in February last. I examined the body, and took such parts as were desirable for the purpose of ascertaining the presence of poison. Mr Jackson has accurately described the condition of the body. The contents of the abdomen were well preserved. That is au-ordinary effect of arsenic. The parts described by Mr. Jackson were placed in a jar I have had occasion toobserve that copper and antimony wil preserve, but I never saw viscera so preserved as in ths case except by arsenic. The jar was effectnaUy sealed for me to take to london for the purpose of analysis Considering the length of intervalbetween the dea and the exhumation, my opinion is that the preservation of the parts could only be attributed to arsenic, arsenic having been found there. The coats of the stomach were quite firm andwel preserved, and the different parts of the anatomical structure clearly discernible. There were no contents of the stomach-merely a thin black pasty-looking substance. That is ordinarily found at a considerable time after death. I tested the coats of the tomach with the substance adhering thereto. I examined the surface with a magnifying glass, to see if I could perceive -any in a solid-state, but I could not; but upon analyzing the coats of the stomach, and the substance adheringto it, I found a smaU quantity of arsenic. The spleen w'as soft, and upon analysis I found there a slight trace of arsenic. The kidneys were very much shrunk, but presented a distinct red brown colour, showing them to be well preserved. The structure was quite firm. Isubmitted them to analysis, and found arsenic present in a rather larger quantity than in the spleen, but less than in the stomach. The heart was very much shrank and tolerably preserved. There was no evidence of disease about -the heart, and no trace of arsenic. The liver was very much shrank, but well preserved. The weight of what I had was 32 ounces. I took 12 ounces of the 32 for analysis, and from that quautity I procured as much arsenic as I obtained from the whole of the stomach. I did not select a particular part, but I took a portion of the mass. The gall- bladder was specially examined, because it does generally contain arsenic if there is any to be found at all. There was bile, not fluid, but rather an extract of bile, thickened and adhering to the interior of the gall bladder. I analysed the gall bladder and the bile adhering and found more arsenic than in the stomach. I produce a paper containing crystals of arsenic obtained by that analysis. I took part of the small intestines, and upon analysis of about onethird of them with their -contents I found more arsenic than in the stomach; I also produce some of the arsenic deposited on copper from the small intestines by the process which I pursued. From other portions I obtained the crystals represented on the drawing which I produce, and I subjected those crystals to tests, by which I ascertained that they were crystals of arsenic. I examined the large intestines, which iere equally well preserred, and I obtained arsenic from them also. I obtained traces of antimony and of mercury in the large intestines> and also traces of antimony in the small intestines. James's powder, which was - given by 3ft. Barber, contains aboutone-half of oxide of antimony. That would account for the antimony found in the body. MIr. Barber was here recalled and said, I gave some calomel and opium to the deceased on the Sunday, and I think a little gray powder afterwards. Dr. Taylor's examination resnmed.-That would account for the antimony and mercury which I found. I took from the chest some liquid, which consisted of water mixed with blood and fatty matter. I examined it all and found no arsenic in that: I am satisfied of the presence of arsenic. I can state it positively as a fact. The analysis produced altogether three-quarters of a grain, but some would be lost in the peocess. It is my opinion that it was administered during life. I think it must have been administered within a few days of death. It was evidently passing out of the body at the time of death, more being in the intestines than in the stomach. Vomiting and purging are the ordinary results of the administration of arsenic; pains in the abdomen andthirst also; they are the Primary symptoms. If given in solution the probability is that much would be tbrown off from the stomach. Taken in any state there is a certain quantity thrown off by vomiting and ping whHe the person lives. We find people get better from these symptoms, and then secondary symptoms appear. The secondary symptoms, I believe, are due to the absorption of the arsenic into the blood. It then affects the spinal marrow and the brain. The affection of tho brain is shown by unconsciousness, delirium, stupor, and so forth; and the effect upon the spinal marrow is to produce convulsions, twitchings, stiffness, and numbness. What Mrs. Riley said about the deceased feeling a general paralysis I take to mean numbness, which is a very frequent symptom of the secondary kind. There are ordinary diseases of the brain which produce symptoms of the secondary character. That does occasion a difficulty in ascertaining the cause of death unless the head can be inspected when the death is quite recent. Having heard the account given by Mlfr. Barber, I think that it would in this case occasion a difficnlty in ascertaining the cause of death, unless the symptoms in March were preceded by symptoms of irritation, such as those which appeared on the Sunday and Monday. Arsenic in doses from a 12th to a 20th of a grain is sometimes prescribed as a medicine; but no sach symptoms as those described in this case would result from the medical administration of it, nor would the same onantities be found afterwards in the body as in this case. The head was not in a state that any examination of it would have been usefeL I never heard of the use of arsenic for hardening iron. I do not believe that it could be nsed for that purpose. It is so volatile that the attempt to unite iron would dissipate it. I found no trace of arsenic about the soil of the grave where the body was. Cross-examined.-Arsenic is used in the manufacture of glass, for the purpose of poisoning vermin, in the manufac. ture of green paper for covering room,, and in the manufacture of shot it hardens the lead. It is used in Scheele's green; that is the pigment to which I was alluding when I spoke of the green paper. It is used very much in painting wood; but I don't know of its being used in painting metal, though it might be so used. I have known bakers' shelves painted with it, and the bread injured thereby. It is also used for steeping corn, sheepwashing, and other agricultural purposes. The poison might have been in the body four or five hours or three or four days before the death of the deceased. Mr. Justice ERLE asked whether the object of the learned counsel's questions - was to show that the poison might have been admmistered on the 14th or some other day instead of the 13th of May? lir. STEPrEN said that It was. Mr. Justice ERLSB was clearly of opinionthat the day was Iimmaterial. MrZ. Sins' submitted that it was most Important that the prisoner should know precisely on what charge he was tried. Mr. Justice 1:RLE.-If your hypothesis is that it was administered on both days then the administration, on the Monday would not add to the guilt of the administration charged on the Sunday; and if it is that the administration took place, not on the 13th, but on some other day, then I think the day quite immnaterial. Dr. Taylor's examination resumed.-I formed my opinion that arsenic was administered during life onits presence and diffusion through the stomach, liver, intestines, and gall bladder. Ihavo known the simptoms begin themomentthe arsenic has touched the stomach, but it is more usual to find an interval of about half-an-hour. I have paid attention to the subject of madness in connexion with crime. The disposition to take away Jife is a well known type of one form of madness, called "homicidal mania." It operates at intervals upon persons so affected, To ordinary observers the person may anpear to bave recovered, and yet afterwards commit an act of violence under the influence of the disease. I do not believe myself that it predisposes to arson, though, others have said so, as is recorded in my book oa medicaljurisprudence. The arsenio could not have been admministered asnmuch as a month before death. R I~obert tFrancis Mitchell, chief constable at Oakhan, proved the delivery-of the sealed jars to Dr. Taylor at ths Stamford railway station. Willian MayesRHibbins.- remember Mrs. Bacon!sdeath, I was 'theD theprisoner's apprentice. About aweekbefore thedeaththoprisonercame mto the shop and told me to .purchase sixpenayworth of arsenic. He told me to go to Mr. Wilford's, a druggist at Stamford, He gave me the mnoney. He told me if they asked what it was for, I was to say it was for hardening iron. To my knowledge there wa no *on to be bardened at the shop at that time. The irisoner's.principal work was in locks and bells. I wlent to Wilford's; they would not let me have it without a wIt. 'nems I told the prisoner so, and he laughed &Au sgad, "tWell I never mind, I'll get it myself." I xtayed wlth himna week after his mother's death. Cross-examined.-There were no bean milg wlhen I was sent for arsenic; there had been two before, but tbey were fent out some time before. They had to be hardened, but that was done with prmssiate of potass. I left because I was helping him to work, and he struck me. Iwasnot ucyto bim. I toldabont being sent for the aenicathomebefore Mrs. Bacon's body was taken up. Imentioned it about two months after her dexth. The prisoner had some houes, but Idon't know thathe had any land. They werein the town. le once mentioned to me that he had caught a rat upon his premises. George Patterson, chymist at Stamford.-I know the rlsoner. I remember his coming to me en the 8th of May, 1855. He wished to purchase twopennyworth of arsenic. He said he wanted it for poisoning rats. I recommended a preparation that I had made for the purpose of destroying rats. He said he had tried that, and it had not answered, and he wished to have the arsenic. I then told him if he wished to have the arsenic he must call a witness to attest it. He went out and brought in William Clifton. This is n,y book. The prisoner signed it. (The entry was then read. It was headed, "Sale of Arsenic Regulation, 14 Victoria," and contained an entry of the date, May8, 1855, the quantity sold-one ounce-the purpose for which bought, killing rats-the names of the purchaser and the Dr. Taylor, in reply to a questionbythe JunGE, saidfrom two to five grains o f arsenic wrould ordinarily he fataL. Williatn Clifton and an apprentice of Mr. Patterson's Patter ason, crooae totsinn o h ia Richard Dean Holkins, a bilor at Stamford.-In May, 1855, I llved in part of the house I now occupy in Broadstreet. The prisoner occupied the other part. I had occupied my part nearly fiveyears before ay, 1855. We had part of t e cellar under Baton's house. I have seen two rats there within the last seven years, The first rat was about six years ago, and the last about four years ago. We suffered inconvenience from that one. It used to get at the meat, and I destroyed it. Since then we have suffered no inconvenience from rats. Cross-examiined.-After Mr. Bacon left, when we took down the partttions we had some mice. They catme from Bacon's room, and I got some verminkiller and destroyed them. That vas about two years ago, in November. I destroyed the rat also with verminkMller. * Mrs. W. Bacon, recalled.-On Monday, the 14th of 3May, the deceased said she wished for some broth, and asked me tomake some. Theprisoner'swife wasthere, .and she said they had some at home already made. That was on the Monday, abott 2 o'clock. Mrs. Bacon went for the broth end brought it. It was warm, and the deceased had it. The prisoner was not there at that time. She continued still to improve after taking it. She took about a teacupful]. It remained upon her stomach. Dr. Taylor.-I have known as a matter of medical experience an interval of nine hours between the taking of arsenic and the first appearance of symptoms. Mr. STEPHIEN then addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner, commenting upon the utter inadequacy of the motive suggested enl the part of the prosecution for the commission of so horrible a crime, upon the failure of the evidehee to show any administration by the prisoner of anything injurious to the deceased, as it was inconsistent with the circumstances proved in evidence that, either in the broth at dinner, or out of the little square bottle, he could have administered arsenic or any other poison; upon the absence of suspicion at the time of the death, and upon the insufficienr y of the evidence to show that he had given any false accoant of the purposes for which he required arsenic. He also pointed out to the jury that all the evidence adduced was as strong to show an administration by the wife of thb prisoner as to show an administration by the prisoner himself; and he alluded to the fact that she was now the inmate of a lunatic asylum as affording a probable explanation of the circumstances of themse; and thrt explanation he would render more complete by calling a witness who had been present at the trial in London of the pilsoner and his wife for the murder of their cbildren, and who could satisfy the jury that that unhappy woman was afflicted with that dreadful diseaso called homicidal mania of which the criminal annals of the country afforded so many lamentable examples, and that she had been acquitted on the ground of insanity. Mr. 3MLLOh objected that no such evidence could be received, as it was irrelevant to the present investigation to show that the prisoner's wife had been acquitted of another murder, commAitted at a different time, on the ground that sbe was then insane. The learned JUIGIE was disposed to think the evidence was irrelevant, and, it all events, the only regular way of p oving an acquittal was by the production of the record. t could not be proved merely by the testimony of a witness who was present. Mr. STEPHEN then resumed his address to the jury, and, after dwelUim upon the prisoner's mauifestations of fliual affection during his mother's illness, as affording a strong argument in his favour, and depicting the unparalleled misery to the prisoner which was necessarily involved n two such chaiges as those to which he had been subjected, he concluded by imploring the Almighty to lead them to a just conclusion. bIr. MELLOR, in reply, commented only upon the attempt which had been made to involve the prisoner's wife in the suspicion of having committed the offence now charged, though she was not there to defend herself, and though there was no tittle of evidence to conneot her with the The learned JuDGz having sammed up the evidence with great miDuteness, The jury found a verdict of " GUILTY." and the learned Judge thereupon ordered that sentence of death should be recorded.
NORTKERS CIRCUIT. DURHAML JuLY 24. CROWX COURT.-(BCfOrC .Jfr Baron WATsoN.) HATS V. DRISCON. This was an action of crim. con., to which the defendant pleaded "1Not guilty." YMr. Pickering, Q.C., and Mr. Reath appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Price and Ur. Davison for tho defendant. M1r. PICKERING, in stating the case, said the action was brought to recover compensation, such as the law awarded, for one of the greatest injuries that one man could infdict upon another. The plaintiff, James Hays, was a master mariner in South Shields, and the defendant, John Briscoe, had formerly been in some trade, but in consequence of his having Teceived a considerable fortune from his grandfather he was now out of business and lived on his own means. The plaintiff was married to a person in his own station of life in 1S51, and for several years lived on the most affectionate terms with her, They had one daughter, who at the period of the injury complained of was about five years of age. The plaintiff and his wife lived first at Newcastle and afterwards removed to South Shields. The plaintifi's occupation of a master mariner compeled him to be occasionaUy absent, and in October, 1855, he was engaged to take a vessel to Constantinople and B3laklava. As some occupation for his wife, and to enable her to maintain herself more comfortably, he took a shop for her to carry on a grocery business, and he aLco secured to ber by a seaman's aliotment note the payment of half his wages from his employers during the time he should be absent, In addition to this he had nade arrangements with a i elative to pay to her an allowance in money. To show the affectionate terms on which the plaintiff and his wife at this time were living the learned counsel read the following correspondence between the plaintiff and his wife while he was in London with his ship, just before sailing for Balaklava:- "South Shields Ott. 3D, 1i55.13 My dear Huwbond,-I embrace the present opDertunity of answering yau rcoat welcome letter, aud Ieam happy to know thatyou have got sa to Ion on: and mv dear James, Ide wish I had been with yen.

To this letter the plaintiffreplied in an affectionate letter, stating his safe arrival in London, and giving an account of his ship. On the 9th of November the plaintif's wife wrote again to him about his clothes e and concluding, Ms dear Husband,-I conclede with my deepest lore to you, and remain erer your affectionate wGiHe, "MARGRiKBTE HAiYS." On the same day the plaintif wvrote to his wife, and, after giving her some instructions about forwarding periodicals and newspapers to him while away, his letter proceeds:- "I send my bett respects to au frlends, and give my dear little Janey a kiss for me.

In another letter, dated the 10th of November, addressed by the plaintiff to his wife he "wishes the ship was far esiough rather than it should be the cause of thus separating us." He says, ' I would fain have you here, if it could only be mranaged cleverly, for I feel a great miss of you. If you come, come quilckly." In a letter dated the 19th of November the plaintiff wrote to his wife,- "Yours of yesterday I have recelved, and am grieved to learn that you 'have been ill. I thought that ometbing more than oommon wonla prevent my fond and faithful wife from writing to me for four dways.hank God, youray you are again well also mydear chid,..

On the 3d of December, 1855, the plaintiff wrote .again to bis wife from London:- "My dear and ]ovinicAWife.-.I have just received your most,affec. tonae letters, and l do fret blessed in the posaesion and the fond and deep affection of mny on dear wife, my ever loving and lored partner through life. 1,1v G^od In His mercy protect yen and my dear, dear child In mny unavoidable abteee and bring me once more in safety to mny own haven of bappinsee-mry owvn happy home; for it I. there anad shoe onlyI fe myself truy bleat.

In answer to this letter was one fronm his wife, dated Shields, the 9th of December, in which she says the shop improves weekly, said she hopes it will be all ready for him when he comes bask Vain, "a*nd tben, my dear, I hope yoal will aot hare to go awsry any more from me; for this has almost killed me parting from you." Several other letters of a similar teossor were read, in one oF which, written by the plaintiff from tlhe Dovwns, he tells he'r to go to hwis Qowners St iv tbe balance of wages due to himn, which he bad ordered to b paid to her, and also to take care of a policy of inturanoo'om his effects for 60. which he had sent to her in ease-4f any. thing happenlng to him. Some letters of tboe same tenour ware also read, dated Balaklava, one of which informed. ber of the time when ho expected to be back home. In October, 1856, the plaintiff arrived at-Leith on his return, and immediately wrote to his wife to announce the ahip'sarrival and to tell ber that he had bought her a Royal Stuart tartan dress and plaid, and had sent it to her. During the interval that the plaintiff was away that in. [jury had been inflicted upon him which was the subject of the present action. The defendant was a married man at that time, but now was a widower, and had chUidren and grandchildren. He had been acquainted with the plaintiff before ho went away, and was in the habit of visiting his wife after the plaintiff left. She bad changed her abop for another in the same street in April, and it was at this latter sbop that the improper intimacy had taken place. The defendant 'was seen constantly in the sbop acting as if he were tho owner, and ahe was seen constantly on his knee caressed by him. On one oeeaion he had slept in the house under eircnumstances wbich left no doubt as to the terms on which they were living. On anotber oecasion the bed had been noticed in a tumbled state, at if two persons had dlept upon it. It was mentioned in the defendant's presence and he made no reply. This state of things having gone on for several nonths the letter written by tlae plaintiff atating when he should return was shown by the plaintiff's wife to one of the witnesses, and was also shown by ber, as would be proved, to the defendant. In September, 1856, the deendant took lodgings for the laintmfils wife to go to, so that she might not bO at omeonhis nreturn, the sbop was shut up, and sheleft South Shields with her child, and went to live at Sedgefield at the lodgings which the defendant had obtained for, her. There she took the name of Mrs. Briscoe, and there she remained tili December, the defendant visiting her every week on terms of the'closest intima. Iu Decemn ber she left Sedgefield and went to Newcastlewith the defendant, where shc remained six weeks, and on te 7th of Februsry the defendant and the plaintiffs wife were marrrled at Bishop Wearmouth, and after that lived as man and wife at the lodgings at Sedgefleld; and on the 9th of March following she gave birth to an infant the result of the intercourse between her andthedefendant Be could only suggest that the plaintiff's w hadcommitted the offence of bigamy in order to avoid discovery and comments on her connexion with the defendant. On the plaintiffs arrival at Lelth he received a letter from his wife, stating that she had given np the shop, and had gone to live in a situation where she could keep herself and child. On arriving at South Shields the plaitiff could leam nothing of his wife, nor where she had gone. In October he cbanced to meet the defendant at the twhiswifel, South Shields, and asked him if he lnew where his sf. vas; but the defendant said he did not, he only wished'ho did. It was not until May last that the plaintiff received some information that his wifewas living at Sedge. field, where he went in cormpany with a policeman in Eearch of her. There he found the defendant and his wife living together as man and wife, and on his asking her how she came to be living there she told him that aho was 2narried to the defendant, and burst into tears. The plaintiff then immediately gave her into custody on the charge of bigamny The defendant, it was evident, had used his wealth for the purpose of seducing her from her duty to her husband. On one occasion it would be proved he had thrown to her carelesely a 100l.-note. He had found her poor and lonely, her husband absent. He had wealth at command, and had taken advantage of her position to insinuate himself into bur affection to destroy the bappiness of her husband and the home of her child. Uinder these circumstances, it was forthe jury to saywhat damages they wouldl givre. Proof of the marziage was then given, when, a short con. sultation having taken place betwreen the learned counsel, Mr. Palc, on behalf of his client, consented to a verdict for 150Z. M'fr. PMMrna;G.-Your Lordship and 'thi jury wtill understand that the acceptance by the plaintiff of this verdict is quite bond fide and without collusion. There are many painful circumstances which would be disclosed if the eviaence were gone into-painful as well to the witnesses as to the pisrties. HsS LORDsip.-There can be no doubt about the bona jEdes of the plaintiff He has brought this action, and has indictea the woman for bigamy. This is a very painful case-extremely so. I have attended to lr. Pickering's opening, which showed a very strong affection between the plaintiff and his wife. How this lady came to change her views so very suddenly I don't know. A verdict was then taken for theoplaintiff-damages, The plaintiff's wife, Margarite Hays, a very handsome and respectably dressed young woman, with an infant in her arms, was yesterday tried andfound Guilty of bigamy in marrying the defendant, as stated.

THE EWST 3ARTLEPOOL HAlR 1oUnR AND EAIWAY COMPANY. This was an action to recover damages for tho loss of a vessel, alleged to have been lost owing to the negligence of the defendants. Mr. Atherton, Qa., and Mr. Unthank appeared for tho plaintiffs i Mr. ill, Q.C., and Mr. hlanisty, Q.C., for the defenuants. It appeared that the plaintiffs, MeEsrs. Woolfe and Jeffrey carry on business in London, and were the owners of a vessel called the George IV. On the 4th of January, in the present year, this vessel, in balast, was attempting to enter the mouth of the harbour of West Hartlepool duinga gale of wind, but owing to the defendants' neglect in not exhbitlig signals or beacons to warn vessels approaching of a number of large stones close to the north pier, which had been pIaced there for the extension of the pier, the vessel came into collision with them, when they were covered with water, and in about six minutes filled and sank. It was alleged to be the duty of the defendants to erect beacons or signals to warn vessels approaching of this danger, as by the statute incorporating the defendants as acompany they were entitled to take tolls fromvessels taking refugein the harbour. he vessel w;as afterwards sold as she lay, and a loss was incurred upon her amounting to 7001. It was alleged that two othervessels, theoLady Aberdorand the Severn, had been wrecked on tbese atones. Theocase was commenced on Thursday afternoon and was resuumed this morning, and occupied the greater part of the day. For the defence it was contended that three other vessels had got safely into the harbour that same day, and that if the plaintiff's vessel had pursued the proper course it would have got in safely also. The jury fonnd a verdict for the plaintiff for the ful amount claimed. SArTURDAY, JuLY 25. (Bcforc Jrr. Baron WrTsox.) RENDALL V. ALLISON. IfMr. TEIUPLE, Q.C., Mr. Pickering, Q.C., and Mr. Reath appeared for the plaintiff; !Ir. Manisty, Q.C., and the Hon. A. Liddell for the defendant. From the opening of Alr. Temple, it appeared that this was an action to recover the value of certain furniture, fittings, and fixtures aleged to have been sold by the plaintiff to the defendant. The defendant by his pleas denied the contract of purchase, and alleged a set-off for ale and spirits supplied and money lent by himnto the plaintiff. On the 20th of November, 1856, the plaintiff, being the owner of a publichonso, with the fixtures, fittings, and furniture therein, entered into a written agreement with the defendant for the sale of the house,fiLxtures, and fitiDgs, the price of the house to be 1,0001., and the fixtures and fittings to be taken at a valuation. The word " furniture" did not occur in this agreement; but after it was written the defendant, according to the evidenceof the plaintiff, verbaly agreed that the furniture should be ineluded in the valuation and be purchased by him. Subsequently a valuation was made by two appraisers, one being appointed by each of the parties, and in this valuation, which bore date the 5th of March, the furniture also was included, the total amount being 2911. 15s. The plaintiff continued to occupy the house in which the furniture and fxtures remained down to the 13th of May, when he gave up the keys to the defendant. The house had previously on the 15th of April, been duly conveyed to the defendant, and the price of it paid. The questions in this action were, whether there had been a verbal agreement to purchase the furniture, and if so, whether there had been an acceptance of the same so as to satisfy the statute of frauds. Much evidence of a very conflicting character was adduced. Mr. MAN'ISTY baving addressed the jury for the defence, Mr. PicxxaL'NG (in the absence of Mr. Temple, who was engaged in the other court), replied. After a careful sunamni g b7 the learned JUDGE, the jury found a verdict for the plainihff-damages 971. 4s., being the amount claimed, less the set off which was admitted, leave being reserved to the defendant to move.
NORFOLK CIRCunx. CAMBRIDGE. JULY 24 NISI PRFuS COURT.-(BcforC Lord CPBEL) (Before tn Spccial Jury,.) MERTOIT COLLEGE, OXFORD, V. XASOX. Mr. Keane and Mr. Tozer were counsel for the plaintiffs - Mr. Serjeant Wells and Mir. Couch were counsel for the defendsant. This was an action to recover 1041. lOs. due to the plaintiffs as the lords of the manor of Merton, in this town, as a fine payable by the custom of that manor on the admission of the defendaint to certaixtn tenements on the death of her husband, the late tenant, the custom being that such fino should be taken at two years' value, subject to deductions for repairs and quit rents. The college, at firs>, demnuded 110., but theaefendant disputed the claim as excessive and unreasonable, and the plaintiffs then caused the property to be valued by two surveyors in this town -Ir. Smith and Mr. Wentworth-aand they adopted tbe lower valuation of the two, which was 1041 lOs. Tte defendant having again disputed this demand, the present action was brought and supported by the evidence of Messr. Smith and Wentworth. Oa the part of tbe defendant, however, two other surveyors of this town, * Tessm Mann and Harwood, were ca31ed.

It appeared that the defendant, who was a gentleman of fortune, was driving home ia his dogcart, when it ran agaist a cart, and the shafts of the dogeart were broken, and the horse ran away, having part of a shaft stil adhering to the h rness. It proceeded at a very rapid rate, until at length it ran over the plaintiff, who was walldng along the road, and very much injured him.

Thomas Warr Simeon was indicted for forging a bill of exchange for the payment of 801. 10s., with intent to defraud. There were several counts in the indictment vary- t. erjeant Kinglake and Mr. Ponlden were counsel for the prosecation, and Mr. Collier and Mr. Coleridge defended the prisoner. This was an indictment preferred at the instance of the Admiralty, and created the greatest possible excitement in consequence of the high family of the accused. It appeared that on the 13th of May last, shottly before 4 in the afternoon, a person in the dress of a mate in the navy went into the Devonport Bank and tendeted a bill of exchange, apparently drawn by a paymaster of the ship Vixen upon tbe Admiralty for 801. lOs., and asked for cash. The clerk gave him chango for it partly in Bank of England notes and partly In gold. The bill purported to be certified and approved by the proper officers of the ship in the usual manner. The party received the money, and without counting It put it in his pocket and walked away. The whole transaction did not occupy more than three minutes. The bill was sent to London in the regular manner, and it was diicovered that all the names were fprged. There were suoh persons filling the different offices in the ship, but they were all incorrectly spelt. Informnation was sent into the country. One of the three clerks in the bank on the 19th of May saw a person he believed to be the one who had obtained the money going past the bank. He endeavonred to get out in timne to take up the person, but tho door being locked he was prevented getting out for some time, and the person escaped. On the following day, however, one of the clerks and a messenger of the bank, accompanied by Mr. Eastlake, the solicitor to the Admiralty at Ilymouth, and the superintendent of pulice, went on board the Cordelia ship, lying in Plymouth harbour, and the clerk and the messenger picked out the prisoner as the peron who had brouglht the bill of exchange. The prisoner was called into the captain's cabin, and told what the charge against him was; he instantly denied all knowledge of the mfatter, and declared that he did not even know where this bank was, and had never been in it. The prisoner was searched, but nothing of consequence was fonud upon him. Be was at once taken into custody, and was then taken to the bank and the other clerk immediately declared that the prisoner was the person who had been at the bank that day. None of the witnesses had ever seen the prisoner at any other time. The two bank clerks and the messenger now stated it to be their belief that the prisoner was the man; they had little doubt about it. It turned out that by some means a great many of these bills of exchange, the greater portion of which are printed, had been obtained from the waste paper-office of the Government, and several of them had been presented in London and other parts wivh all the names forged. The preseat bill was said to be a dreadfully clumsy forgery. A curious cirennastance was stated during the trial. A master in the navy, who was called to prove that one of the names was a forgery, stated that Inst Wednesday evening he was introduced to the prisoner at Exeter, and on the following morning he stoppeJ the prisoner and asked him if he had not breakfasted that morning at the New London Inn. The prisoner declared be had not done so, but the witness said he was positive he mad, and so positive was he that he would have sworn that be was the person until the actual gentleman was pointed ouLt to him, anid he then saw the mistake ; that person he now pointed out in the court, and he certaiy very much resembled the prisoner. Mr. COLLIER, in his address to the hury, pointea out the danger of relying too miuch upon evidence of identity when the party had only been seen for three minutes, and where there wa nothing to attract ths attention of the witneses at the time. The learned cousel also related a6 circumstance that had occurred to himself only last week, when a gentle. man had met him in London and referred to a conversation which he said he had had with him that afternoon. Mr. Collier told him he had not seen him before that day. The gentleman stil persisted that the conversation with him had taken place, but he assured him that at the time he referred to he was dhiing in the House of Commous with four members of Parliament. iThe learned couinsel then said that on the p resent occasion, mnost fortunately for the prisoner, he should he able to show most clearly that he could not have been in the bank at the time, andi that he was mnost perfectly innocent of the crime iaputed to him. He was a young genatleman, the sonL of a distinguished commander in the navy, and had entered upon the honourable profession of -which his father was so dlstingaished an orna. moent ; he had been brought up with high niotiouS of honour, and had been educated as a gentleman, had always associated with gentlemen, and the charge now imiputed to him was one which from his very soul he abhorred, and one of which he was incapable. He did not ask for mercy at their hands, but he demanded an acquittal from their sense of justice. They bad already heard that the only question was one of disputed identity, and he thought uLpon the cvidence for the prosecetion he might almost have rested for an acquittal, bnt the answer to the charge was so comnplete that he mush plaou it Weon them, so thit this young gentleman just Commsncin" lifo might retire from the court perfectly free from all stam or suspicion. The son of Sir sranci8 Collier, Mr. Cardale, and Mr. Wogan, all midshipmen in the navy, were called, and they accounted for the time at which this offence was comn mitted, and clearly showed that Mr. Simeon was with one or other of them from 3 O'clock till past 4 in the afternoonx of that day, making it clear that be could not have been at the bank. Other witnesses were also called who corroborated these gentlemen, and so clearly proved the innocence of Mr. Simeon that, The JUDGE asked Serjeant Kinglake if after this evidence he could press the case further. The learned SERJZANT said that he thought in so sprious a case he should exercise a wise discretiou in not allowing the case to go to the jury. The JUDGE said if these witnesses who had been called for the prisoner were believed it was utterly impossible that he could have been at the bank. Mr. COLLER said this gentleman would leave the court without the slightest stain upon his character of any kind. Verdict Not Guilty. It may, perhaps, be right to state that every onue appeared to he perfectly satisfied with the result and with the inno. cence of this young gentleman. Mfessrs.

OXFORD CIRCITfT. STAFFORD, JuLY 23. CIVIL COURT.-(BefOre .Al. Baron MARTIX and a Com- mon Jury.) 3tRAIIDBURNM V. GBIFEaN AND ANOTHEP. Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. M'Mahon appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Huddleston, Q.C., Mr. Gray, and Mr. 'ill for the defendants. The plaintiff in this action was a farmer and manufacturer of artificial manure, and he sued the defendants, who were also manufacturers of artificial manur6 at Wolverhampton, to recover damrges for a libel pubhished by them in the fo'rm of an advertisement. The libel charged the plaintiff with "continued misrepresentation of facts in connexion 'with the prizes of the Bushbury Agricultural Society." Ultimately the jury found for the plaintiff, with one farthing damages, and the learned judge refused to certify, to give the plaintiff his costs. CRmixnAL Co'CwT.-(Before Mfr. Baron BBAmWELL.) George Jackson, aged 20, labourer, and Charles Brown, aged 21, groom, were chargedwith the wilful murder of W. Charlesworth, at Abbot's Bromley, on the 23d of May, 1857. Mr. Motteram and Mr. Clay appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Kenealy defended Jackson; and Mr. Cook Evans the other prisoner, Brown. At the request of the prisoners' counsel the prisoners were tried separately. The case of Jackson was first taken. Mr. MoTrTlAur having stated the nature of the cases the learned counsel called a number of witnesses, who proved these facts:-The deceased, W. Charlesworth, was a farmer living at Rake-end, near Abbot's Bromley, and late at night he went into a public-house there, called the Coach and Horses. He was not very sober when he went in, and had some more liquor. On the opposite side of the taproom sat three men, Cresswell and the two prisoners Jackson and Brown. Cresswell was called as a witness. He said he got his living by playing on the dulcimer, and, according to his evidence, while the deceased was drinking spirits with a man named Green, Brown proposed in Jackson's presence to have a bit of fun with the deceased, and to go out and frighten him. On being assured that there was no intention of doing any harm to the deceased the witness Cresawell consented to go with them. Jackson and Brown went first, and Cresswell said he followed them about 60 or 70 yards on the ibchfield-road, when they all three Eat down on a bank by the roadside. While there Brown said, *-If he has any money we will take it, and it will do for a spree." As soon as this was said the publichouse door was opened, and the deceased came out. The prisoner Jackson said "He's coming; come on, chaps," and both Jackson and Brown got up and ran away towards IAechfield. The witness Crosswell said he kept on the bank till the deceased had passed, and having followed him a few yards and listened, without hearing anything, he returned to, the Coach and Horses and went to bed. It was then about 1 o'clock, and the same morning, a little before S, the deceased was found lyigD on his back by the Lichfield road side, about one mile from the Coach and Horses; there was a pool of blood under his head, and anotheron the road, and nearthe body thesewas a formidable weapon, a hedge-stake, which had been taken out of the hedge, about 15 yards from where the body was found. There was no doubt upon the medical testimony that death had beeR caused by this instrument. There was a bruise behind the left ear, the left jaw was fractured, and there were fractures in the base and other parts of the skull. In order to connect the prisoner Jackson with the murder it was proved that he was one of the men who had been at the Coach and Horses and left with Brown and the witness CresswelL He was taken into custody the next iorning and his boots were compared with two footmarks on the roadside, by the hedge from which the stake appeared to have been taken, and they were found to correspond exactly. Search was also made under a rick by Jackson's father'house, and two purses were there found, tbe one containin 12. 17s., and the other =ontaining a 5L. bank-note and 11. 13s. 6d. in coins. But the most material evidence was Jackson's own statement, mado before the magistrates, which ran thus : "l went to theCoach and Hones on Frday nigbt.

The jury, after a few minutes' conasderation, found the prisoner Jackson Guilty. The prisoner Charles Brown was then put upon his tri before the sam ijury, and charged with the same offence. Mr. Motterarn and Mr. Clay appeased fur the prosecution; and Mr. Cook Evans defeinded the prisoner. The witness resawell repeanted the evidence given by him In the preceding case, and stated that when he was sitting with the two aen on the bank the prisoner Charles Brown stad "If he (deceased) has any money we will take it, and it'ildo for a spree.' On cross-examination it appeard thhat in the first instance ho (Crestwell) was taken into custody upon a charge of being concerned in the murder, and that he then gavethie information which implicated the two prisoners. Ho got his living by plang on the dulcimer at publichouses and fairs, and ba done no work since the pottery riots, except fetching coals for the keeper of the White Hart at Hanley. He persisted in his statement as to what he alleged the prisoner Brown bad said about taking money froma the deceased, though he said he thought the.parties only matant to have a bit of fun and frighten the deceased, or he would not have gene out with them. The prisoner Brown, it appeared, was taken into custody the next morning, and on the left sleeve of his coat were marks, of what appeared to be fresh blood- and when charged with tho murder he turned very pale, and seemed amazed. After being taken into custody ho expressed a wish to the constable to confesswhat he knew of the matter, and afterwards be madae a statement to Ellis Crisp, an inspector of police, who, after duly cautioning him, took dowin his statement ian witing. A strong effortwas made bythe prisoners counsel to exclude this statement, but it was ultima,tely admitted, It ran thus : "'I was at the C-oach and Horses, George Jackison, "DulcWimier 3&acit lOresiwol)l i H. urry, and C.

When before the magistrate the prisoner made this statement:- " I did not Dick up the stake. I did cot perruade him t) go with me. I picked one ocpket, and he picked mnother. I savehim the moner, bnd he gave me two half*crowns, and atha is a'll Mr. C. EVANS, in addressing the jury for tho prisoner, said he trusted they would give no credit to a witness like Cresswell, who was interected in exculpating himself, and was clearly a man of disreputable life. The case against the risoner then rested entirely on the prisoner's ownatatement. We contended there was nothing in that statement or in the other evidence to show that the prisoner Brown either struck the deceased himself, or that he concurred with Jack son in the deadly assault which Jackson had made on the deceased. Even if there was some suspicion about the case the learned counsel hoped the jury would givQ the prisoner the benefit of his good character. Mr. Baron BRASUWxLL, in summing up the evidence, said that if the prisoners went out with a common objeat, as to commit a robbery, or burglary, and in the prosecttion of that object one of them did an act which amounted to murder in him, the narty who was present and concurring with him in the co'mmon object was equally guilty of murder in the eye of the law. The question', then, which the jury would bave to consider would be whether the sct committed by Jackson was done with interLt to rob, so as to amount to murder in him. If it was, the jury must then consider whether the prisoner Brown went out with Jackson with the common purpose of committing a robbery; for if he did, and the violence which caused the death was inflicted by Jackson .in pursuance of that common design, the risoner Brown was in law guilty of murder. His Lordship then read over the pnsoner's statement, and reninded the jury of the prisoner's good character, though his Lordsbip did not think that in a case of this nature character could assist the jury, unless it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds. Thbe Jury in a few minutes found the prisoner Guilty. MIr. Baron BIcASrELL asked the jury whether they believed the prisoner Brown knewthat Jackson had the hedge- take in his hand, and that he intended to hit Charlesworth The jury answered in the affirmative. Both the prisoners were then called up, and asked by Mr. Hemp, the officer of the Court, whether they had anything to say why judgment of death should not be given against them? Silence being proclaimed in the usual form Mr. Baron BRAiVELT,, addressing the prisoners, said that, whatever sorrow might be felt for them, and though they might not have intended to take away the life of the deceased, it was impossible to doubt the propriety of the verdict which the jury had given ; it was certain that that unhappy man (Charlesworth) had met his,death by the blow given to him. Both the prisoners had been found guilty of an intent to rob, and that by means of a murderous weapon. It might be that they did not intend to take away the life of the deceased; but they did not care whether they did so or not; and, according to law, they were both guilty of wilful murder. His Lordship said he could not hold out to the prisoners any expectation that their lives would be spared. He warned them that they were'now at the end of t eir days, and if they thought they could make any proper use of the remaining time of their life he exhorted them to do so. His Lordship then pronounced the sentence of death in the usual form, and the prisoners were removed. CvML COUnT.-(Befor.e Mir. Baron MAtTiN.) Having disposed of all the civil business, Mr. Baron MARTIN this day assisted In the trial of ptisoners. Joseph Vaughan, 31; John Harrison, 24; John Allsop, 28; and Henry Jones, 19, were charged with unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on John Smith, on the 12th of July. Mr. Davis appeared for the prosecution; and Mr. Mot. teram for the defendants. The prosecutor keeps a tollbar at Whitgreave, on the Stafford and Stowe turnpike-road, and early on the morn. ing of Sunday, the 12th of July, was awoke, by a stone breaking his window. He got up, and eaw the defendants, who were tailors, out upon a "lark." The prosecutor dressed and followed them along the road, and asked for payment for the damage done to his window. The defend. ants denied breaking the window, and said they would pay Smith in anotber manner, and proceeded to push him about. Smith then attempted to walk on to Stafford, to ive information to the police, when the defendant vaughan set upon Smith, knocked him down, and then kicked him into the ditch. A man named Skelton, who was travelling on foot to Sheffield, his native place' happened to comeup, and on his endeavouring to assist Smith, was laid hold of by the other defendants He ultimately got to Smith, whomxhe found lying insensible, and managed to drag him into the tollhouse. Smith was taken to the Stafford Infirmary, when it was found he had one of his ribs broken, and for several days his life was int danger. The lury found all the prisoners Guilty. Mr. Baron MARIvN sentenced Vaughan to 18 months', gfarrison to 15 montes', and Allsop and Jones each to one year's imprisonment with hard labour. - His LoRDSsIP eulogized the conduct of the witness Skel. ton, and, finding that the stntute made no provision for rewarding a man in such a case, made him a present of 21. out of his own pocket. John Birch, Aged 56, coUier, and John Davis and Job Stanley, also colhers, were charged with stealing 60 tons of coal, the property of Mr. Darby, at Bilston, on the 24th of February, 1857. Mr. Scotland aupeared for the prosecution. Mr. Kettle defended Birch, and Mr. Motterama the other prisoners. It appeared that the elder prisoner, Birch, was a collier, who had premises at Bilston, between which and the prose. cutor's land there was a strip of land belonging to a man named Brown. The other two prisonerswere butty corner and under directions given by them and Birch, miners had been employed to thyrl a heading from a pit in Birch's land under Brown's and into Darby's, and from that they had worked out, between the 18thand 25th of Febrnary, asmuch as 60 tons of eoaL This was proved by a witness who had ascertained the fact by regular hatchingsand drillings. On the 18th as much as 10 tons had been taken, and the pri. soners were warned not to work further under Darby's land, and that if they did thoy would hear more aboutit,and they were directed tocut off the heading. On the 26th it was dis. covered that 60 tons more had beentakenfrom under Darby's land, wbich had sunk in coasequence. Mr. Kettle and Mr. Motteram, in addressing the jury for the prisoners, disputed the accuracy of the measurements, and said the Act of Parliament had been practically in abeyance. The jury convicted all the prisoners, but recommended Davs and Stanley to mercy. Mr. Baron MARTIN said he had no doubt of the pro. priety of the verdict, but he should not pass any sentence upon the prisoners, because the statute upon which the in. dictment was frameda(the 7th and 5th George IV., cap. 29, sec. 37) had only been acted on once in this county since it was passed. H'is Lordship then ordered the prisoners to be discharged on entering into their recogmizances to appear when called upon, hut added that, in any future case, a severe punishment wuld be inflicted.
ROME CIRaurr. MAIDSTON1E. .TUTV 9N CIVI BIDE-(Before the LoBRD CHIEF BtoARO and a 4pecial JsTwW.) SHILLING V. THE ACCIDENTAL DEATH INSURANCE COM- PANY. The plaintiff in this action, Charlotte ShiUing, sought to recover from the defendants, in the capacity of adminiatratrix to the estate of ber deceased husband, Thomas Shilling, the sum of 2,0001., upon a polcy for that amount effected with the defendants upon the life of her fatherin-lav, James Shilling. The defendants put a number of pleas upon the record as an answer to the claim, among which was one that the deceased James Shilling was afflicted with fits and a ruptine, which rendered him peculiarly liable to accident, and that he had concealed this fact from the company, which rendered the policy void according to the conditions on which it was issued; and they also pleaded that the policy had been obtained by fraud; that the death was not the result of acci. dent, but arose from wanton and voluntary exposure to unnecessary risk; and, lastly, the comnpany pleaded that the policy was a wagering and gaming policy. Mr. AL Chambers, Q.C., Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. J. F. Smith were conosel for the plaintiff; Serjeant Shee, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Bushby were for the company. Mr M. CsHAAnEP.s, in opening the case to the jury, said that the plaintiff sought by the present action to recover from the Accidental Death Insurance Company the amount of a polioy of insurance fcr 2,0007 effected upon the life of ber father-in-law, Jamsns .Shilling, who was unfortunately drowned on the evening of the 11th of July, 1856, and he said that, although the defendants had put a number of extraordinary plean upon the record as an answer to the cllintiffs claim, he believed that when the facts were laid before them it would turn out that the action was perfectly indefensible, and that the plaintiff had an undoubted right to recover the amount of the policy in question. HEe then proceeded to state the facts, and it appeared that the husband of the plaintiff, Thomas Shilling, carried on the business of a builder at Maling, a short distance from 1Madstone, and that his father, James Shillmg, lived with him, and that he was nearly 80 years old and very infirm, and his sou used to drive him about oceasionally in his pony chaise. In the month of March last year an application was made to the defendants to effect two policies for 2,0001. each upon the lives of Thomas Shin ad J es Shilling, and to secure that sum in the event of either of them dying from any accident, and the policies were completed and dehvered in the folowing month of June. On the evening of the 11th of July, about half- past 7 o'clock, the father and son went from WAiling with the pony and chaise for the purpose of proceeding to a stone quarry at Aylesford, where Thomas Shilling had busness to transact, and they never returned home again alive. There were, it appears, two roads by which they could have got to the quarry from Mailing, one of wbich was certainly rather a dangerous one to be taken with a vehicle and horse, on account of a bteep bank leading to the river Medway-being on one side and the railway passing close to the other; hut this route, it appeared, was much shorter than the other, which was nearly two miles round, and it was consequently constantly used both by pedestrians and carriages. About 8 o'clock the pony and chaise and the father and son were seen on this road, and upon arriving at the gate leading to the quarry Thomas Shilling ot out, leaving the pony and chaise in the charge of his father. Mr. Garnham, the owner of the quarry, was not at home, and vhile one of the labourers was conversing with Thomas Shilling the sound of an approaching train was heard, and the maen advised him to go back to his pony for fear It should take fright at the tram, and he said he would do so, as it had been frightened by a train on a previous cocasion. He accordingly went .owards the gate where he bad left the poBy and chaise, and from that time there was no evidence to show what took place. The family sat up the whole night awaiting the return of their relatives In the utmost possible alarn at their absence, but nothing was heard of them-until the-ollowin morning, when a bargeman found the drowned pony and the chaise ank e dead b6dies of the father and son floating in the Medway near the spot where the chaise Iad- been last seen on the previous evening. They were taken home, and a coroner's inquest was held, andthe only conclusion that could be arrived at was that tho pony had taken fright at the noieo of tbQ traiN1 which appeared to have passed about the. time, and that he -ad jumped into the river, which at this spot was from 12 to 14 feet deep. Thomas Shilling, it appeared, left the whole of his property to his wife, and among it was the policy of insurance upon the life of his father, which had been assigned to him, and in due course application was Tiade on her behalf to the company for payment of the two policies; but it appeared. they wero -not satisfied with the explanation that was given as to how the accident occurred, and employed a detective officer to make inquiries In the result the company paid the ,000L. upon the policy effected by Thomas Shilling, but Tefused to pay the other, upon the grounda stted in their pleas upon the record. A good mauy witnesses were called to make out these fapts, and on cross. examination it appeared that the deceased James Shilling was in very distressed circumstanceS% and had been in the receipt of parochial relief, which was discontinued, and he in consequence was compelled to go and reside with his son. It also appeared that he was ruptured, which fact was comcealed from the comapany, but it was denied that he had ever been afflicted with fits. The policy was put in, whilch contained the nsual eovenunts, and also expressed that it should ho void if any material information was witbheld from the directors, or if the party assured should wantonly and voluntarily expose himself to unnecessary risk or danger. Serjeant SHEE, at the close of the plaintifl's case, made a most able address to the ury onbehalf of the company, who, he said, would never have resisted such a claim if the circumstances that had come to their knowledge had not rendered it an imperative duty for them to do so. He then called several witnesses, from whose evidence it appeared that Thomas Shilling had gone to the officers of the company in London, and made the proposition personally, to effect the two Insurances, and that he declined to treat with the agent of the company at Malling, and at first only described himself as a friend of James Shilling. It was ,dso deposed to that Thomas Shilling had pasid the whole of the premiums npon the policies effected with the Accidental Death Company, and that he hAd also assured his father's life from accdent with a railway insurance company for 1,000. The will of the poor old man was also put in, and it created a ood deal of amusement from the fact of his being descri in it as a gentleman, and the instrmnent going on to devise estates and properts of every possible description, when the fact was that he did not possess anything m the world, except his interest in this policy, and wuas m reality in the condition of a pauper -at the tSme of his death. Some members of the family of, the deceased were also called as witnesses, and they deposed to his having had fits, and also to certain statements having been made by Thomas Shilling to the effect that if his father should meet with any fatal accident he should get some money by it; but it was elicited, on the cross-examination of these witnesses, that a great deal- of Mllfeeling wsceted in the family by the plaintiff getting the whore of theproperty, and that this fac evdenly ad god daltdo iththe Information that was subsequently given to the company.

POLICE. GumnDALu.-George Cox was brought up for further examination relative to the charge of feloniously catting and wounding Caroline Cox his wife, and a man named Wilham Forty, with whom she has lately cohabited, with intent to murder them. John Smith, cross-examined.-The prisoner was in a very excited state on Monday, and I heard him say as he was going to the station-house that the wounded man -bad seduced his wife, and it was that which drove him to act ashe bad done. Hesaidhe had beenmarriedtohis wife 21years; she had left him about 19. weeks, and he had been endeavouring to regain her. He said all that very quietly, but ho trembled verymuch. I saw him strike the woman twice, :nd at that time he certamly appeared in a frantic state of mind. The policeman who took the prisoner into custody also said the prisoner was in a very excited state. William Forty, the wounded man, having been aUowed to leave the hospital to give evidence, was then brought into court and examined, when he said-I am a bootmaker. I have known the prisoner about four months, and have been in hiscompany only about four times. On Monday last I left home for thepurpose of coming tothe alderman at this court to ask his anvice how to act with regard to my furniture, whichhadheendistrained by two different claimants for the rent, and on my way I met the prisoner. I said, ' Well, George, whathas brought you here P" le replied, To see you.' I asked him wvhat 'or, and he said, " To kcnow if you have seen Caroline (meaning his wife) yesterday Alderman CAsTER.-I suppose you knew Caroline was the prisoner's wife at that time ? Witness.-No, Sir. I neverknew it from first to last. I told him I had not seen his wife, and he said she had made a promise to meet him on the Sunday previous, and he thought I might have seen her. Ee asked me where I was going, and I told him, upon which he said he was satisfied. We walked together in the same direction a short distance, when we met his wife, and I immediately said to him, " Why, George, yon knew whete Uour wife was when you askedme about her." We had all proceeded some considerable distnce down Aldersgate-street, and when we came to St.-Martinrs-le-Grand I asked him if he would take -any. thing to drink. He said, "No, William, I am not much of a drinker, but ,11 take a little porter." We accordingly went into a pubichonse at the corner of Angel-street, and st down in the parlour. The prisoner sat between his wire and me. I called for ; t of half-and-half and something to eat, whick I paid or, and then he said he would have another pot, which he paid for himself. His wife whispered something to him upon which he struck her a blow m the face-with the back of his hand, which madeher mouthlbleed. I said, "George, if that is tour game rm off," and immediately went obt, and was urrying across the road, when I felt myself stabbed in the shoulder, and saw the prisoner close upon me. I called to my son to assist me, aud then called for the police. I did not see the prisoner plumge the dagger into his wife, but I went with her and, my son to the hospital. Cross-examined by Mr. Lewis,-! have been a widower about a year and nine months, and I first metthe prisoner's wife on New Year's Eve at the Standard Theatre. From tbat time until March I visited her three times at her own house at 1, Harvey-street, Hoxton, and I have seen both her daughters there. I know sbe had a daughter living at Clfton-street, Hoxton, but I did not know that she left the prisoner to go and hve with that daughter. She lived with me as my housekeeper from the 7th to the 21st of March. I do not mean to say that it was the prisoner's wife, for I did not knowv Carolne was his wife. I am the father of seven children; the youngest is four years old and the eldest 16. Caroline Cox (the prisoner's wfe) slept in the parlour. I ilept in the samoroom. There wvere two beds in that room. Mr. I.ewis.-Did you and Caroline Con occupy one of those beds ? Witness.-I decline to answer that question. Mr. Lewis.-I am satisfied with that answer. Now tell me who slept in the other bed ? Witnees.-I shall decline to answer that question. M. Lewis.-I am entitled to an answer to that ques. tion. Mr. Martin.-You must anSwer it. Alderman C,%nTER.-You are bound to answer that question. Witness.-Well, I slet in that bed. MIr. Lewis.-Very wel Now, give me the names of the children who slept in the bed not occupied by you. Witness.-There was only one child. I do not remember if any other slept there also, nor their names, for we were so pushed about at the time. Mr. Lewis.-Do you mean to swear now that you and this woman did not occupy the same bed? Witness (hesitating).- Well, I will say we did. Alderman CAs,TXu -Did you both sleep in that bed in the same room with the children ? Witness.-Not with the children. for there was only one child sleeping in the room. I was at the daughter's house in Clifton-street about March last, when the prisoner came and attempted to illuse his wife. I saw him leave the room, andI followed to prevent him imusing her, but I did not colar him. She was not locked in the room by me or any one else while I was there. He asked what right I had to interfere, and struck at me, but we did not fight. - I did not go away with her. Mr. Lewis.-Upon your oath, has she not been living with you from that time continously till the present ? Witness--Sho has; but Ialways understood she was a single woman. She left me a fornight ago and took lodgings in Smith-street, but I have not slept with herat that place. Ihave been to see herthere when I have been sent for. I had not made any appointment to meet her near the Post. office on Monday last, and when she joined the prisoner and me I did not make any advance to familiarity towards her The prisoner was not excited. He was quite collected. When I lived with her I did not know she was either married to or living with tho prisoner. She alwavs denied being the prisoner's wife, and said his name was Cox and her namae was Cust. She had no ring on her finger when I first knew her, and I thought she was single. She took me to see some frends at Kingston, and told *ne to say I was her brother. I did not take her there. Her friends did not ask her where her husband was. About a week or ten days ago he came to me and said he should like his wife to return home to him again, and asked me to persuade her to go back. I told him I would rather see them together again, and that I did not wish to see ber any more. I did not see her three or four times after that. I saw her once, and tbe prisoner was aware of it. I have urged her-a dozen times, and more than that, to gobacktoherhusband. I first urgedher to do so about two months ago. I did not know she was the prisoner's wife, and urged her to go back to her children. Uponmy oath, I did not know he was her husband, and wnen we all three went into the ptblichouse he did not use one word to induce her to go back to him. I did not say "She is going to leave me, so we mnust have a parting drop," nor an3thing to that effect. I did not excite him in any way while in the publichouse, and he did not say "F or God's sake, do not irritate me so." I did not atempt to sit next to Caroline, and he did not come between aus to prevent it. He did sit between us. I never whispered a word to Caroline in his presence. I did not say to him in a jeering way, " Suppose we all three take hands and walk into the water," nor anything of the sort, neither did I say I was a good swimmer, and could kick him under, and that therefore Caroline would be quite safe. I had not said a word to Caroline to induce her to whisper to the prisoner, or to excite him to -strike her the blow on the face. Iwent out of the honse first, and said, "If that is the way you are going to behave, George, I am off ;" but I did not hear his wife say. " And I am off with him, too." I did not see her again until she -was wounded. When he struck her on the face with the back of his hand he did not appear to be excited. Alderman CARWT--Had you been quarrelling before this blovs was struck. -Witness.-..No, Sir ; It was, more the other way. we were all good-humnoured. My'son accompanied me from home, hut I1 left bina outside the publiohouse 'because I did not think it a proper place to takehiinoWewr abouthalfan hor thre, nt moe.Msowakdnoe sie f herod yhisef,an In h ohe wthth pi neig%iouros called her by that name. I never gave out that thas Was her name. After the blows were given the prlsonf t seemed' exelted, but certainly not in a maddened state. He appeared agitated when in custod. William James Forty said,-I am the son of the last witness. I left home wnth my father on Monday last between half.past 1 ani 2 o'clock to come to Guildhall. I walked by myself on one side, and when my father and the prisoner and the woman entered the publichouse I waited outside until my father came running oxt, called for me, mud shouting "P olice "' as loud as he could. I ran across the road as qick as I could to his assistance and saw the prisoner with both arms raised as if he were wrestling. The uisoner then left my father, and before I could overtake m I hearal the woman calling out, " Hold him." She crouched down on her knees under the tobacconist's window, anda I saw him strike her with something vhich a thought at the time was a knife, He raised hs hand again to repeat the blow, when I caught his arm and found he had a dagger in his hand. I said, " Would you stab my father?' not knowing he had already been stabbed, upon which the9prisoer said, "Oh, you are the son !" and triod to turn the dapger round in his hand to stab me bat, fnding he could not do it, he said, "I am satis- a. s soo as he was secured by the policeman I went backto lookafter my father and the woman, and found they a ot hbeen stabbed, and the blood was pouring from the woman's back. Mr. Lewis.-Look at that man bebind you, and tell me what he told you to say as you were getting into the witness Witness.-He told moto be sure and say my father always believed the womantobe single. Mr. Martin.-Let that man stand forward. tThe delin. uentao rdiogly showed. himself, sand gave the name of Mr. Lewis.-I have now to apply, Sir, that you, will conmit this man for contempt of court. This witness has been ordered out of court, because this is a case which rests alost entirely upon corroboration, and it was tberefore must material that the witness should not know what evidence had been given. Alderman CARTrxn (to witness),-Do you know this mani Witness-I have seen him severaltimes in our neighbourhood, but he is no relation wbatever. Alderman C.aRRT-Did you know the woman?

Penidry.-Imerelyreminded him that tho woman had always represented herself as a single woman. Alderman CARThE.-You must have been conscious you were trYing to prevent justice by inducing this lad to state that as a fact o which he was ignorant.

Mr. Lewis.-After what has taken place I shall postpone tho cross-examination of this witness, and I hope, Sir, you will order that no friends be allowed to have any communi. cation with the woman in the hospital. Alderman CAITER then gave the necesary directions, and the further hearing of the case was adjourned till Friday, when it is expected Caroline will be well enough to attend and give her version of the matter. IBowsTsEE.-Astout,iwel-dresedriddle-agedforeigner, who gave the name of Jose Beranguer, and said he was a Spaniard, was charged with throwing vitriolover the face and shoulders of Mary Bayfield, a servant girl in the employ of Mr. Humphrey, a solicitor, of 31, Bloomsbury. street, Bedford-square. The officers having charge of the case were occupied nearly the whole of the day in searching for an interpreter, t&e defendant having objected to each person who presented himself in that capacity, on the ground that he did not whoUly comprehend the language. The prosecutrix deposed that about six weeks ago the defendant came to the door of her master's house and inquired for "a forelgn lady." He had called once or twice since, and she had seen him loitering about the street repeatedly in front of the house. On Thursday,ecalled again, about 2 doclock, and was again refused adaissionthere being no lady in the house who knew him. Iii the evening, about 9 o'cDlck, she was near the door, havinggone out onan errand, when the defendant came upclose to her and threw some liquid at her. A portion vent on theside of her face, burningher very mauch; andherbonnet, mantle, and gown were stained, havng since completely chanced colour. She ran in and told her master, and some lotion was procured to apply to her face, which removed the MIr. Humphrey corroborated the girl's statement, and said that he ran out aud, seeing a policeman, gave the prisoner into custody; The upper Prtion of his house was let outin apartments, and several foreigu ladies had resided in them from time to time. The defendant (through the interpreter) admitted that he was in quest of a German lady who once accompanied him to England, and who he was certain still resided in Mr. Humphrey's house. He was not happy without her, but they refused him admission, and he had walked in front of the house with his opera-glass, hoping to see her in one of therootns. He had made her presents. Shehadroceived moneyrof him, and therefore he had.a right to seeher... Mr. HENRY desired the interpreter to inform the defendant that! whatevermight be the custom abroad, itwasnotthe fashion ithis country-to admit a stranger into a gentleman's house upon the pretence that he wanted to see some lady whom he supposed to be residing-there. But what had he to the-chareo of throwing vitriol over the servant maid, who certainly had only cared out the instructions of her master in refusing him admission ? The defendant sid the charge was false. He believed the master and the girl conspired together and trumped. up the charge to be revenged on him. The interoreter here informed his worship that defendant clismed to be tried before some other magistrate. He would submit his case to another man. * Mr. HERY.-Tell him that I shaU give him in opportunity of submitting his case to 12 other men, as I intend to commit him fortriaL Ask if he has any friends in London, and what is his occupation ? Nr. Hurmphrey said the defendant bad described himself ahsiag -been formerly an extensive slaveowvner In America. The case was adjomrmed to enable the defendant to confer with his friends, and to send to his residence in Regentsquare. On being resumed, Mr. Braham, a solicitor, attended on his bebalf, and stated that, having confarred with the girl's master, and satisfied him of the respectability of the defendant, who was a Spanrih merchaut of considerable position, he now pro osed to plead guilty to the act of damazing the glrs dress althoug he had no intention to inflict personal injury on the girl herself. With the sanction of the magistrate his client would pay the girl for whatever damage might have been done to her dress. Mr. HENRY had some hesitation about disposing of the matter in this way. No doubtit would be difficult to prove a wilfullintention to injure the girl's person, or otherwise he should commit him for trial, and he would be liable to transportation for the offence. Mr. Humphrey said he had sanctioned the suggestion of the defendant's solicitor, but he wished it to be understood that the ladies residing in his house were of the highest respectability and knew nothing whatever of the defendant, who laboured under some delusion. If he undertook to abstain from annoying them in fature and paid the girl SL for the damage done to her clothes he should be satisfied. This proposal was eventually acceded to, the defendant saying that as the girl's clothes had been injured somehow, and as he had been charged with it (although wrongfully), he would give her 54, or even 104. if necessary. The money was then paid, and the defendant entered into his own recognzances in 1001. not to annoy Mr. Humphrey or the inmates of his house in future. KMYLEurBoNE.-John Wetherell, a most violent fellow, who has several times been convicted for assaults upon the police,-was charged with having on the previous night violently athacked and beaten Cleal, 346 S, in Ermest-street, Regent's-park. The evidence went to show that complainant, whose face was much bruised and swollen, was, when he was attacled endeavouring to induce the prisoner to go quietly home, and that he (prisoner) beat him on the heaa and body in a most savage manner. The prisoner stands remanded till Wednesday next, when he wil be sent for trial. W EST M-Catherine Brown, an untidy-looldn woman, between 30 and 40 years of age, was charged withi frauds upon the Catholic clergy. The Rev. Mr. Garsyte, officiating clergyman at St. Mfary's Chapel, New-road, Cbelsea, said that the prisoner came to hum en the previous evening at the chapel, and representing that she was livng at a brothel in C harles-street, saia that, although sho wras well clothed and fed, she had, as well as her sister, wiho was also at the same house, the most earnest desire to change her course of life. She expressed their desire to fly from the place that moment, but s3id they had not a halfpenny to procura food or lodging. In order to rescue them, if possible, from sin that night, he gave the prisoner half-a-crown to procure them food and lodging until he could see what could be done for them. Immediately after this he was informed by a person who bad seen the prisoner leave that she was one of an oranized gang who infested Catholic chapels and praotised different frauds. Thoy assumed different characters, and dressed up to personate them. The Rev. Mr. William Roberts, who officiates at the Catholic Chapel, Westminster, said that the prisoner had visited him with a similir story. She came to him at confessional, declared she had led a very bad life, and expressed so earuest a desire for amendment that he mentioned the case to his mother, who afforded her a maintenance for some little time. Prisoner spoke with much appaent anxiety of a twin sister who had been leading as bad a course of life as herself, and having induced witness to interest himself in her behalf personated her in another garb. It havin!g been mentioned that thehouse of ill-fame she had alluded to did notexist, and that there was every reason to believe there were other charges against the prisoner, she wras remanded for a wreek. 14. in postage stamps was received from " W.

WORsHP-sTRn r.-John Aarons, a well1dressed aunburnt young felow of 22, giving his residence as the Continental Hotel, City, was charged before Mr. IAMIIILL with being concerned in the following case of abduction. Mr. James Pass, a tradesman in Pitfield-street, Hoxton, who was much distressed while giving his evidene, stted that his daughter Rebecca, between 15 and 16 years of age, had, been brought up under the care of her aunt, a lady of propert residing in Northumberland-terrace, Regent's. park-road, who had adopted. her almost from infancy, and with whom she had remained till the beginning of last week, when, in consequence of a discovery her aunt had made, she as entbac tohim uner he areou evn,ta ho might be himsef responsble for her. The girl wa therefore carefully looked after at his own houe till the preoedingafternoon, when tho prisoner, who was hisnephew and hid. recoently returned trom A dral, ealled uport him, and stated that the aunt was very' auxious to see her niece, that she was going out of town, and that if the girl visited her at once a reconcihiation vould no doubt be effected. Witness, on the faith of this representation, consented to allow his daughter to go to her aunt's with him, !pou the strict promise that he would bring her back by 6 oclock the same evening, "but," said the witness, "she did not return, I have not seen ler since, and find that her aunt had not sent for her at alL I have searched for her everywhere; I have been up all night 'looking and in. quiring forher, butuselessly, and, &dingthat the prisoner, whileo was out looking for her, called at the house to secure her clothes I gave directions to the police for hig apprehension, andhe was taken. Mrs. Louisa Salomans, a portly, lady ike woman, confirmed the fxrst witness's evidenoe as toher bringing the girl up, and stated that s'he had endeavorea to inculcate respectable notions into her mind, as she -would eventually come into possession of the greaterpart of her property; but every attempt to ake a lady of her had failed, for she would constaatly associate with servants aid persons of inferior station, and she at last discovered thit she had formed too close a familiarity with a young man £n the neighbourhood, who was not worth a penny snd wholly undesirable in every way. Inrthiscorreapondence she found also that thegirI had beenxecondedbyoneof herfemaleEervapts; shetherefore at once discharged the servant, and sent her niece home to her father that he might tske care-of her 'and the girl have ime for consideration. She hid certainl' not sent for the girl, but, on the contrary, was desirous she should remain where she was, and all that had passed 'iytb the prisoner, whom she had not before seen for many years, wss this:Ho0 called upon her and asked why ber niece had been sent back to her father, and on her teling him the cause he mentioned the-name of the young ran who was so strongly objectionable, spoke in strong terms in his favour, and expressed an opinion to the effect that he should like to see all people vwo loved each other brought together. The prisoner then left, and she heard to more of the matter tIll she was astounded by the information that the lirl bad been inveigled by the prisonerfrom her father's Onuse on the pretence that she had tent for her. The difference between them was, of course, only of a temporary character, and her nkiece would merely haLve iemained with her fsther till the difficulty referred to ivs obviated. In defence the prisoner said thatall he had done was by the yOUng lady's wish. He was ceit y loting in pocket by it; on the contrary, he was a great d6al ontof po-oket. Might he make a statement? Mr. HAMSILL said, certainly, but wbMtever he did say would be taken down, and, If neeesaty, used at his trial.

Akroyd went to the cottage of the prosecutor, and attempted to cat the poor old man's throat with a shoemaker's knife, his avowed purpose being to kill him because he had heard that be had scandalized his (Akroyd's) wife. Akroyd would, no doubt, have taken the old man's life, had he not been forcibly seized and kept fast by a young woman named Ann Thomas, just as he was making a third gash at the poor fellow's throat. IHappily Akroyd was secured, and a surgeon promptly got to the wounded man, who is now likely to recover, but his life is not out of danger. The nature of the wounds inflicted were thus described by Mr. W. Nowell, surgeon, in his evidence before the magistrates on Friday lastr:-" One cat was exactly across the throat, and almost three inches long and a quarter of an inch deep.

IRBLAND. wrROM OUR OWN COORESPOWDM?R-l DUBLIN, SATURDAY MOnRNMG. RuAIOUnED IEEOTION PETITION COMPROik In reply to certain statements put forward in the Irish journa]s, Mr. Michael Dinne, one of the mem- bers for the Queen's County, has published an I address to his constituents, denying that he, or any other person on his part, entered into a compromise with Mr. Fitzpatrick by the terms of which he was t,o resign his seat at the end of the sessiOn. BIe has no| intention of the kind. He is now firmly fix;ed asI their representative as long as the Parlianent lasts The withdrawal of the petition is now a greater mystery than ever. The scenes of violence and clerical intimidation at the Queen's County contest would have almost made Dr. M'Hale blush, and no rational person could have supposed that Mr. Dunne would be in a position to append XP. to his name 24 hours after the case had undergone the scrutiny of a committee of the House of Commons. TME IURDELM OF MR. ITTE. According to current reports it is not yet certain whether Spollen will be put upon his trial at the next commission of oyer and terminer, which opens on the 4th proxiro, or whether it will be postponed until the commission following, which sits about the middle of October. It is said that the case for the Crown has been intrusted to Mr. Fitzgibbon, the eminent Queen's counsel, and one of. the ablest criminal lawyers at the Irish bar. Spollen's eldest son, who gave rather reluctant and not very important evidence against his father at the police investigation, .has been dismissed from his employ. ment at the railway works at Broadstone. THE POTATO CROP. The accounts this morning from the south are more favourable, and, although there has been rather. more rain than could be desired at this advanced period of the season, the alarm of failure, at least to any material extent, is beginning to subside. The CorkExaminer reports as follows:- ' The weather for the past week has been by no means of a favourable character. The early part of it was cloudy and dull, with only occasional slight showers, but 'with a pervadmg dampness. Last evening and the whole of this day have been very wet. The moisture will be found serviceable to the turnip crop, which has already suffered severely, as indeed have a good many of the other roots. such as carrots, &c. 'With the potatoo crop the case is different, as much rain would be likely to prove injurious. The existence of disease in this esculent is now a fact that caunot be disputed, but as far as we can learn as yet it does not appear to be making rapid progress, and it is possible still that it may not prevent the digging of a fair average produce. The cereals sUll present the same satisfactory appearance." The reports generally from other quarters are still more satisfactory, and, with the exception of those from some of the southern counties, we hear nothing of the progress or even appearance of the. old disease. TIM MAN FOR GALWAY. A letter from Galway thus discourses on the merits of two of the candidates for the seat left vacant by the eviction of Mr. Anthony O'Flaherty. It may, however, be added that if the writ issue at all Sir Thomas Redmngton is almost certain of his election, and that Mr. Moore is so perfectly sensible of this result that he has no real intention of pressing his cldais upon the notice of the electors:- ' Sir Thomas has much in his favour ; he is known to ba a good landlord, a kind-hearted man, without any fluster or nonsenso about him. He is in independent circumstanoes, too. The only thing against him is keeping offilce at the time of the passing of the Titles Bill. Some of those who cry him down for that would do the same thing themselves. Indeed they would, and maore than that. Moore, on the contrary, is an impracticable blusterer, areal 'snob', the veriesb Cockney you ever saw, and he is as needy and as seedy as possible. There is a Tory in the field, too. The only danger is that the two Liberals may make way for the Tory. However, the general impression is that Sir Thomas will win in a canter. think the Galway men won't do as the Ross men did-that is, turn out Sir Thomas and put in an old kiln-dried Tory and bad Landlord."

EnECmON AT CARD=.-John Lewis, convited at the recent Glamorganshire assizes of the murder of his wife, GwenlUan Lewis, at Merthyr, on the 4th of January last, suffered the extrenre penalty of the law on Saturday morning on the scaHold of =ardiffGaol. An immense concourse of people, variously estimated at from 10,000 to 12,000, vitnessed the executiorn An application had been made to the Taff Vale Railway Company to run special trains from Merthyr to Cardiff on the occasion; bat the directors very property declinedto comply with the request. Great numbers of people nevertheless came down from Merthyr and the neighbourhood on the previous evening, many of whom, being urnable to obtain lodgings in Cardiff loitered about the precincts of the gaol during the night. Since the prisoner's condemnation he has been attended by the Rev, Cyril Stacey, chaplain of the gaol, and the Revs. R. T. Verrell and A. Tilley, but although he appeared to pay great attention to the admonitions and exhortations of these rev. gentlemen, who unremittingly pointed out to him what he had to fear and what he might humbly venture to hoo, he persisted tothe lastin denying that he had ldlled his wne. He eadmitted having treated her with greatbratality, and that his conduct had no doubt caused her death, stating that after he took the half-sovereign from his wifeshe said to him, ' You shaU never see my face alive again," and then ran and fell or jumped down the stairs at the bottom of which she was found dead. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to add that this statement differs materially from the one made by the prisoner when taken into custody. In the course of Thursday the prisoner was informed of the result of the efforts which had been made to obtain a commatation of his sentence, and that there was no hope of his life being spared. He received the intelligence apparently with little emotion or surprise. On Friday Cal. craft arrived at Cardiff and slept at the gaoL The condemned criminal passed a restless night and spent several intervals in prayer. Shortly after 6 o'clock on Saturday morning the Rev. R. T. Verrell the Rev. A. TiUey, the mayor (Mr. Jenkins), the Rev. C. Stacey, the High Sheriff and other functionaries, had an interviewwith the wretched man, who stil reiterated protestations of his innocence, declaring that if a pardon were offered him to acknowledgo his gUilt he could not do so, and that he would not go into the presence of his Maker with a lie upon his lips for ten thousand worlds. At a little after 8 o'elock Caleraft entered the condemned cell and performed the operation of pinioning the prisoner, to which he submitted without manifesting much trepidation, though he appeared to be rather prostrate and dejected. The procession to the galJows was then formed, headed by the chaplain (reading the burial service) and the High Sheriff, next to whom came the Prisoner, sutpported by Mr. Hume, deputy-governor, and Mr. Thomas, chief turnkey of the gaoL The mayor and other officials, with Calerafe, followed. On arriving at the scaffold therope was speedilyadjusted bythe executioner, who having quitted the drop, the bolt was withdrawn, and after a few convulsive struggles Lewis was dead. After hanging for the allotted time the body was cut downv, and, in pursuance of the sentence, was interred within the precincts of the gaol, near the grave of Tamar Dick, who was executed a fewyears ago forthemurder of his mother. The eircumstances of the two cases were somewhat similar, and both prisoners requested that they might be buried in the clothes in which they were hung. The crowd assembled on the occasion, with but few exceptions, behaved with decorum, and dispersed quietly after the sentence of the law had been ,fulfiled. ANoTrnn FATAL RAiLwAY AcomnrvT.-An accdent has happened on the Midland (Bristol 'and Birming'ham) Railway at Alstone, near Cheltenham, which, fol- lowing closely upon the heels of the collision-on the Great Western Railway, within a mile of the same spot, has caused some excitement. In this case the deceased was an nnder-guard of the company, named Edward Price, and was in charge of a coal train from Birmingham to Glocester. A truck of coal was to be left at Alstone-wharf, and on approaching it the deceased, while the train was in motion, stooped from the buffers of one of the trucks on which he was riding to uncouple the truck, when he fell an4 was killed. The coroner's jury returned a verdict of " Accidental Death," accompanied by a recommendation to the directors that they would take immediate steps to cause a discontinuance of the dangerous practice of disconnecting trucks before the engine had been brought to a stop ; and also to issue imperative orders that no guard or other nerson in the employ of the company should, under any circumstances whatever, be allowed to ride on the buffers. ThH GoODWOOD Cur.-The Goodwood Cup for this year is really what it professes to be-a cup and not a palm tree, a group of pugnacious warriors, or flying steeds. It is a noble vase of oxidized silver in the ornamented or renaissance style of the 16th century, and is beyond all doubt one of the most effective I and artistic imitations of the medieval silver work which has yet been produced. The upper part is subdued and simple in style, being only ornamented with flat engraving of ivy leaves and berries upon a bright matted ground. The handles form an altogether novel and strikng combination, and are so interlaced in the quaint elaborate style of the renaissance period as to present the effect of four winged figures of Fame rising from their base. The body is adorned with a finely executed bas relief of Queen Elizabeth reviewing the English forces near Tilbury. The figures are beautifully chased and grouped with excellent taste ana the costumes of the soldieryare takenfrom thebest authorities; the features and dress of the Queen from the coins ofherreign.;The opposite side has an ornamentaltablet for inscription, enriched with bosses, wreaths, and sunken damiescene work. The foot is formed by crowned tritons supporting chased medallion po rtraits after Holbein of Lord Burlelgb and Sir Francis Drake. The general effect of the whole piaeo is unsnsally striking and attractive, andthe imitations of the steeled damascene being perfect gives the vase the aspect of an antique piece of family plate rather than aworkfresh±fom th jeewellers. The design modelling is by Mr. Armstead--the workmanship such an only comes fromr Hancock's.
IAUSTBALIA. MALTA, JULY2L. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's fleet steampacket the Simla, E. Cooper commander, and CommanderKeatley, R.N., mail agent, despatched. from Sydney on the 25th of May, reached Suez on the 12th of July with 35 pa=eengers, and gold on freight to the value of 40,5801. She brought a mail of 178 boxes and bage, of which 159 are for* Southampton sad London, 17 for the overland route (including those for France and the Continent), and two for Jdalta. The nex;t homewvard mail iB advertised to leave Sydney on the 15th of June by ths European, to be followed on the 15th of July by the Columbian., and on the 15th of August by the Australasian. The Great Britain left Melbourne on the 21st of May with 101,600 ounces of gold and 34,000 letters from Victoria. We take the following summary of news from the MeTlhoue Argus of the 29th of May-, " Since the publication of our last overland summary a steady supply of gold has been received from the mining districts, but the average weekly yield has been below that of the past year. The causes of this are not very difficult to boe taced. The eraployment of larger numbers than at any former period of the mining population in deep sinking and inquartz mining, their consequent withdrawal from the immediate production of gold, and the protracted dryness of the season are sufficient to account for the falling off in the escort returns. When the labour of the deep sinkers has been consurmnated and the hoards of the shallow sinkers have passed through the process of washing, the average of tho'returns of the current year wil be brought up to that of the last. " The steadiness with which the quartz reefs are being opened up at a heavy cost of labour and of money, and the large su-ms expended In machinery for the extraction of the metal, are sureindications of the faith entertained bypractical men in the hidden riches of our gold mines. We have stated that at no former period. have such numbers been emploped in sinking. This remark applies esptcially to the districts surrounding Balarat and Bendigo. At Ballarat shafts are being actively carried down at the Durham and Delter leads, at the Gravel-pits and Specimen Gully, and all these localities promise to yield handsomely for the labour that has been expended on them. The quartz reefs at Bendigo areyielding fabulous quantities from the smaU extent of rock opened up. At Dunolly, water, which has hitherto been scarce, is now plentiful, and large quantities of the, by comparison, poor " washing6stuff" wfill now be pawsed throngh the mill. A new lead is reported in this district, about one mile and a half from the Post-office, in which gold has been strack at a depth of 50 feet. At Maryborough greater activity prevails. At the Avoca another powerful engine, the third on the Avoca lead, is nearly complete, and wil in a short time be atworkin keeping the water under command. At MIvor the puddling-raachines are again at work. The favourable accounts from the Ovens are fully borne out by facts. The weeklyescort returns have averaged 6,540 ounces for the 12 months past, while large quantities have been sent down from this district by private hand. " The following comparative statement of the receipts by escort, and the shipments during the first three months of the past four years, shows that the year 1857 is second only to its predecessor:- 185 1855. 1855. 1857.

"When our last summary was transmitted to England we were in one respect in a position precisely dmilar to that which we now occupy. That is to say, we were at the latter end of a month's Parliamentary recess consequent upon a change of Ministry then, and we are in a similar position with respect to a second change of Ministry now. But here the similarity ends. As we predicted eomewhat more than a month since, Mr. O'Shanassy's Ministry was one that had no reasonable hope of a permanent existence. There were then already sufflicent signs of the times to show that an overwhelming majority, both in Parliament and throughout tho country, had no confidence in the new Administration, and that it was doomed to early destruction. So it proved. " The sittings of Parliament were resumed after the last recess on the 15th of April, only four out of the seven rUlinisters having secured seats, the Attorney-General (Mr. Chapman), the Solictor-General (Mx. Wood), and the Commissioner of Trade and Customs (Mr. Greaves) having been rejected by the constituencies to which they severally appealed, although 3Mr. Wood subsequently succeeded in securing his election for the Ovens district. " On the first day of meeting of the Assembly Mr. Fellows, who had held for a brief period the off6ce of Attorney. General under Mr. Raines, gave notice for the following day (Thursday) of a vote of want of confidence in the O'Shanassy Government. Mr. Fellows moved the resolution of which he had given notice, declaring the then Executive to be without the confidence of the House, and their continuance in office under these cireumstances to be unconstitutionaL " The debate commenced by Mr. Fellows was adjourned at midnight till the foDowing Tuesday, but was not actually resumed till the day after, the much-lamented death of Lady Barkly, which had occurred in the meantime, and the fact that her fhneral took place on the day appointed for the resumptionof the debate, having caused a tempor y suspenslon of Parliamentary business. On the Wednesdy, however, the Assembly, after adopting an address of condolence to his Excellency, reeid the debate on Mr. Fellowss motion. The debate was prolonged till past 7 o'clock: the followiug mornin, when a divsion occurred, and the M;nistry were defeated by 34 votes to 19. Mr. O'Shanassy tendered the resignation of himself and his colIeagues. LOntbo,le.xt dLyof mcoting oiParliament, thefollowing Tuesday, the announcement of the names of the neow Ministry was made on their behalf by Mr. Sargood:-Mr. HaiseA Chief Secretary; Mr. M'Culloch, Commissioner of Trade and Cestoms; Mr. Ebden, Treasurer; Mr. Mlichie. Attorney-General; Xr. Moore, President of the Board of Land and Works; and Mr. Flloows, Solicitor-General. "Theonlynewmesesure of any importance that iyasyest been brought beforo Parliament Is one for the imposdtion of a duty of 10g. per lb. on opium-a taLX which may be regarded as a sore of upplemext to the capitateon-tax on tho Chinese. Mr. Mighie (the Attorney.I-enerali has given notice of a motion for abolishing State aid to religion. " AGRICULURE. " The question whether agriculture will pay here is itill raised by a few of those ho adhere to the o'd system, and whose farns, being near the coast, are open to competition from the neighbcouring colonies. In tho interior, near the goldfields, the question is never asked at presont. The higher prices obtained for their produce enable the cultivators of farms in these new districts to pay the current wages without difficulty. The statistical returns not being yet complete, we do not know exactly how much additional Iand has been brought into cultivation during the past season, but there is little doubt of the quantity being largo. Complete returns have been received from five districts and oounties, and in all these except one there has been a large increase. In the district of Bendigo thero were 5,052 acres under croplast season, to l,439 in the previousyear; inthe Ovens district 4.045 acres in 1856, to 2,2l1 acres in 1855; in tha county of Normanby 2,730 acres in 1856, to 1,329 acres in 1S55; in the county of Dandas 918 acres in 1856, to 480 acres in 1855. In the county of Follet there has been little change, as there is nothing grown there except what the squatters raise for their own use. Thenumbers are 128 acresin1856I,to l23acresinlSSS. These five districts arein different parts of the colony, the Ovens leing at the extreme north-east, and the county of lormanby at the south-west extremity, andwillafford a fair idea of the average produce. In 1855 the average yield of wheat for the whole colony was 28 bushels to theacre; the average of these five districts in 1B56is 26 bushels, and we may exoect this to be about the general average for theyear. "The best criterion of the prospects of the agricultural interesthere is to be foundin the constant demand for more free access to land. A Land League has been established with the object of obtaining greater facilities for settlement on lands fit for agriculture, and the farmers are petitioning Parliament for the opportunity of obtaining the tse of a portion of the grazing lands. A petition is also being extensively signed through the country districts for the establishment of a Board of Agriculture. The wantof a recognized head through which information of all kinds might be obtained is much felt, as also the want of a good museum, containing specimens of the most modern implements and machinery, and a library of the best and latest agricultural works. There are now many local societies springing up in different parts of the country, and something like organization and umon is wanted among them. This it is proposed to bring about by baving meetings once a-year, or oftener, of delegates from the several societies, together with certain ez ofpicio members of the Government, the Professor of Natural Sciences to the University, agricultural chymists, and other persons devoted to sciences affecting this pursuit. It is to be hoped that something will be done this session towards the forma. tion of this department, and it is impossible to foresee all the advantages wemay yderive fromit. The climateofAns- tralia is suited to the growth of many valuable plants and* the rearing of many animals not yet introduced, and systemnatic action in this direction aone will greatly increase our means of developing the natural resources of the colony. "The scarcity and dearness of lorse corn have led to the trling of all sorts of expedients to supply the deficiency. Oats are enormously high. Barley is scarcely to be had in suffcient quantity for seed. MIaize is scarce and dear, so there is a demand for oatmeal, gram, and splt peas. The only grain we have in abhndance is wheat, and this, being so much the cheapest, is coming largely into use for feeding draught horses. "1LAxousi. Daring the past month there has not been much change in the state of this market. Good mecbanics have little difficlty in obtaining work, but there are still too many labourers and unskilled workmen unemployed, and the wages of this class have been gradually falling. As wages fall the demand increases, and the number of men unemployed is not so great as it was. The late rains also have enabled many of the employers of labour on the goldfields to resume operations, and we now hear little of a want of employment in the interior. Most of the men seeldng work congregate in town, and their ranks are constantly increased by the new arrlvals. Of these there have been some within the last few days, and we have seen instances of their being engaged on the fir-st day of their seeking employment; bat these must be looked on as exceptional ctses. Many of them have to seek it in vain for many days. For a short time female servants were more numerous than is usual with us, and their wages fell about one-sixth-instead of S 01 a-year, ordinary general servants had to accept 251.L but the number of those unengaged is again decreasing. As far as the working classes are concerned our politicians have chosen an nfortunate season for their Ministerial changes. These changes, and the strong opposition to the Government measures which preceded them, have causeda delay of three months in the commencement of public works at a period of the year when many of the labouring classes have nothing else to look to. After the conclusion of harvest most of the men thrown on the market have no other resources until there is water enongh on the goldfields to allowof the 'dirt being washed up andthe precionsmetalobtained, This channel is now open, and is absorbing most of the unemployed men of the country, and the inconvenience and difficulty arising from the suspension and delay in the commencing of public works cannot continue much longer. All class seem to bo strongly opposed to any further waste of time, and the first work that will be expected from Parliament on the resumption of business will be the passing of the estimates and a definite settlement of the railway question, so that the works may be commenced forthwithi, "From the English papers lately received there appears to be a strong feeling among the unemployed in favour of emigration to Australia; and the stoppage of our grand scheme for the formation of a large department, with plenty of money to spend in forwarding labour to the colony will causo much disappointment. This project Is not likely to be carried out as was originally Intended. Before the arrangements were completed our statesmen were startled to find that, from some cause unforeseen by them, we could not employ the workingmenalready inthe country. This circumstance was taken advantage of by the so-called popular candidates in attempting to secure their re-election. They pointed out the impropriety of sending money away fox the introduction of more labourers when there were so many idle men among us for whom we could find nothing to do. But they either did not see or were not honest enough to acknowledge that the dearth of employment arose solely from a want of foresight on the part of those entrusted with the expenditure of the public funds, tbemselves among the number. The Parliament, and by their authorrity the Executive Government, very much influence the state of the labour market, and the unskilful use of this power may lead to serious results. It was expected that the railways and other works would draw so many men from the regular brancehs of productive industry as to cause quite a derangement of tho business of the country; butwhile measures were being taken to guard against the anticipated evil an unexpected one arose. This again is likely to drive us into the other extreme, and to prevent any means being taken for the introduction of "It appears from our provincial contemporaries that fortune still flings gigantic nuggets at the feet of some of her favourites. At the Whipstick, on the 30th ult., a nugget weighing 26-ounce was taken up in Scotchman's Gully, a short distance from the claim where the 370-ounce nugget was found, and on the day previous (Tuesday) another nugget was taken up out of a different claim in the same ground weighing 19 ounces. At M'Intyre'a a person named IWBvoy has a claim on a quartz reef lately opened, and on Tuesday week he took out from it two specimens, one weighing 1291b. and the other 81b., 1371b. in all. It is supposed thzt about 401b. of quartz will be the outside, the remaind6r pure gold. On the following day he and his mate, a young boy, took out another specimen weighing 1071b., of which the better half is pure gold. The claim is very little worked, and the deepest part is only 18 inches. The finder of the present lot is the same party who found the nugget weighing 129 ounces 1S dwts. nL lso. 3 gully at XIntyre's, whtch was the occasion of the last rash. Of course these are the prizes in the lottery of gold-digging, and there re plenty of blanks, of which we hear nothing. The quartz reefs in various districts are yielding almost fabulous returns. "DLATnr OF LADY BARKLY. "We sincerely regret to have to record the death of Lady Barkly, wifeof his Excellency the Governor. Her ladyship gave birth to a son on the 8th of April, and from that time until her decease, which occurredon thre 17th sult., she suffered from a nervous excitement, producing depression of spirits, fits of hysteria, and at length a complete nervous exhaustion terminating in death. This melancholy event has caUed forth one general feeling of regret for the loss of a lady who had thus early suceeded in conciliating the respect and esteem of all classes, and bas also excited as wide-spread a sentiment of sympathy for her bereaved hus- band. The unpopularity acquired by previous governor; had inducedtbepeopleof Victoria to scrutinize with a watchful and suspicious eye the character and conduct of Sir uenry and Lady Barkly, and it redounds, therefore, all the more to the honour of the deceased lady to have won, as she succeeded in doing, in so short a time the confidence and respect of the people among whom she came as a perfect stranger. This she accomplished by the blended dignity and affability of her manner, her active and unostentatious furtherance of the objects of our charitable institations, and the cordial and intelligent interest she manifested in whatever promised to be oa advantage to the colony and its inhabitants. And the excellent qualities which were thus early developed in the too brief career of the deceased lady deepen and intensify the grief we experience at her loss. Her infant son only survived his mother for a fortnight, and his remains were deposited in the same grave with those of Lady Barkly." A "nBLooDy MuRDEie n A uST uRA .-It Was rumoured that a cruel and mysterious murder had been committed near the dry diggings of Daylesford. There is a large deep waterhole, in a secluded spot, which one might easily imagie to be the scene of such a deed. Blood was seen no rthe rim of the hole, and in several places down the side. The police were on the alert-the neighbourhood was in anuproar. Drags of all kinds were procured, and the ins tecr and his men were all the week indefatigabi to solve the enigma.
