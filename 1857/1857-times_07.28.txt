PUBLIC BUSINESS. The Earl of DERBY moved to call the attention of the Government to the state of public business inthe two Houses of Parliament. He found that for the present week there were set down for consideration in the other House no fewer than 3S BiUs, which had not yet been before their lordships, independently of 12 others which had passed their lordships' House. Of those 38 Bills 14 had not yet been read a second time, 19 were in committee, and five stood for third reading. It was pefectly weU known that tho whole of that evening would be occapied by a discussion In the other House which would not allow of the further progress of any disputed Bills; while Thursday and Friday next were set apart for the consideration of Bills which had been sent down from their lordshipe' House-a very proper arrangement, provided It were not intended to go on afterwards with the other Bills; but if the other business were all to be proceeded with, instead of Parliament being prorogned by the 20th of August, as had been stated, the 20th of September would be a more likely day. (Hear, hear.) He did hope that the Governmeat would interfere to prevent that which of late years they had desired to prevent, and which had always been a great scandal and inconvenience-viz., the hurried manner in which Bills were pressed through the two Houses, more especially throngh their lordships' House, at the close of the session, when there were scarcely any members present to disuss them. (aear, hear.) It was impossible that the great majority of the 38 BiUs could be sent up for a fortnight at least, and when he stated that on Friday last thore were no fewer than 20 pages of amendments to be moved and discussed upon those different BiUs in the other House, he left their lordships to imagine when it was likely that the Government would be able to prorogue. He did not think that it would be an unreasonable thing to propose that their lordships should not take Bills into their consideration, unless they were of great necessity and importance, after the first week in August; and he suggested to the Govornment that thdy should now state tbat they would not receive any Bills after Tuesday, the 4th of August, except these of indisputable urgency. This perhaps might induce the House of Commons either to curtail some of their business, or to get on with It a little faster than they seemed disposed to do at present. Earl GRANVILLE said that the attempts made in previous sessions by the noble lord (Redesdale) to mitigate the evil complained of had certainly been attended with success. With regard to the present session, however, he had been in communicbtion with the noble lord, and it was felt that owing to the late period at which the session began, and the uncertainty which prevailed as to the time of the prorogation, it waq unadvisable that this motion should be made; and tho noble lord, therefore, consented to waive It. He had no doubt that under ordinary circumstances such a mnotion -would be of considerable use. At the same time it was somewhat undesirable that one branch of the Legislature should take upon itself to control to a certain extent the period at which Parliament should be prorogued without much attention to the state of public business, and, therefore, this power of fixing a day beyond which no new bills should be read a second time ought to be exercised with considerable delicacy. Of the 38 Bills which the noble earl alluded to as yet to come before their lordships, it must be remembered that some of them would be disposed of at morning sittings, and would, therefore, be presented to this House earlier thau the noble lord seemed to anticipate. At the same time, if a motion to the effect suggested vere submitted by the noble lord, he should offer no opposition on the part of the Government. He sbould have preferred, however, that another week had been allowed, and, as a middle course, would suggest that the 7th, not the 4th, of August should be the day fixed. The Earl of DERBY was quite satisfed to accept the modified proposition of the noble earl, and fix the 7th of August, Lord REDESDALE, after what had fallen from the noble earl opposite, gave notce that ho should to-morrow move tne adoption of the usual order with regard to public Bills, fxing the 7th of August as the last day for second readings, aod making that a Bill day. He was extremely glad that this cenclosien was come to. TEIE MERCHANT SHIIPPING ACT. Lord BROUGHAA presented a petition from merchants and shipowners of Hull, complaining of the operation of what was commonly called the Merchant Shipping Act of The Earl of HARDWICKE supported the prayer of the petition, which admitted that some Merchant Shipping Act was necesary, but stated that in consequence of other alterations in the law it was most desirable that the existing Act should be submitted to a revision. Lord STANLYy of ALDERLEY promised to consider the subject daring the recess, and if ho found that any alterations and improvements could be introduced he should be very anxio,s to amend the Act accordingly. THE INDIAN ARMdY. The Marquis of CLANRICARDE said that, in calling attention to the events which had taken place in India, and in moving for papers relating to the Indian armay, nothing could be further from his intention thau to add to the embarrasssment of the Government. He knew that the measures which had been taken by them were well calculated to meet for the moment the disasters which had taken place. He placed reliance on their energies, and full reliance on those of his noble friend and relative the Governor-General. He was sure that whatever was required by his noble friend, and whatever the Government asked for from Parliament, would be accorded. Upon them rested the responsibility of dealing with the subject as it stood; nor was it his wish to add to their responsibility or to the difficalties in which they were involved. There was, however, a duty far higher than rust ot putting down the mutiny. That that revolt would be extinguished before very long, whether in weeks or months, he had not the slightest doubt; nor could any rational man doubt that the power of the British amy and the authority of this oountry wonld soon be completely re-established in India. Bat the real difficulty of governing India would not have ended, but have comnmenced when the present mutiny should have been put down. It would be necessary for them to reconstruct their army in India with the same materials, more or less, as they night deem right ; but in his humble opinion it would not only be necessary to do that, but entirely to revise and recast the machinery of the Indian Government, It was absurd to suppose that the present machinery could go on. If anything were wanting to prove that, it would be found in some of the incdents which had recently ocenrred. Could anything be more ridiculous than to see in the emergency in which he was afraid we still were with regard to Indfa, the Minister of the Crown come down to Parliament for the pur- pose of gravely informing Parliament that it had pleased certain gentlemen sitting in Leadenhall-street, who were not responsible to Parliament for their conduct, to consent to the sending out of 4,000 men to India 7 No doubt, even if that consent had been refused, those troops ,Would stiU have been sent outt; but that would have been in defiance of the law. Was it rational to expect that such a state of things, which could only lead to embarrassment, oould be of any possible use to the executive Government of the Crown ? Ee did not want to pursue that sub'ect any further, but he might add that the position in wgoh the Board of Control stood to the Court of Directors was most objectionable. The Board of Control was not able to send out a legal and proper direction to the Governor-General or to Her Majesty's servants in India witdhut applying for a mnandamuz to enforce it. Of course these things would not be regarded for a moment if they stood in the way. What a farce, then, it was to permit them to continue! Nobody could defend them for a minute, and a new state of things ought at once to be introduced. He was not, and never had been, insensible to the glories, for such he would call them, of the East India Company, when the East India Company really existed. Its career was wholly without example, and such as its members might well be proud of. But that company had virtually ceased to exist since 1853, when it was put upen an entirely different footing. We have had in the course of this year a melanoholy proof that the government of India had been In a disgraceful state for the last 25 years. The disgraceful state of the Indian tribunals had been brought before Parliament, and not denied but acknowleodged by Her Majesty's Government. No man could deny that the state of the Indian finances was deplorable, and he would venture to say that there never was such a wretched exhibition of the finances of any country as the annual statement of the finances of India, which showed a deficiency without any prospect of supplying the ways and means necessary to remedy that state of things. And to put the finishing stroke to that picture, let them consider m what a miserable condition our Indian army was at this moment, quite apart from the mutiny; and whatever thatmutiny might have arisen from-whether from greased cartridges or not-it was evident that the complaints of the soldiers were of long standing, and ought not to have been overlooked. Let their lordships consider for a moment what had been the general utility of the Indian army to the empire vhich possessed it. If their lordshlps read in history of a powerful monarch who had, in addition to his own great country, a vast territory containing upwards of 100,000.000 men, and with almost every resource within it that could make it great and powerful, and were told that when that monarch went to war he was unable to derive from that vast territory, governed by his lieutenants, consuls, governors, or call them what yoU would, even one man, one gUn, 11. of money, or one pound of gunpowder in suppor of his war, what idea would their lordships form of the government of that country ? But that was the case during the late war wieh Russia so far as India was concerned. They could not bring a single native from India to aid in that war. He would have supposed that the monarch who possessed that vast territory would have been able by his army to inspire feelings of respect at least, if not of terror, throughout Europe and Asia. Bat they could not draw the slightest support from that country. It was even with feelings of apprehension that they ventured to draw two of their own European regiments from India to aid in the war against Russia. So that in point of fact, when they were engaged in that war, so far from India being an auxiliary tous in Earope, and helpingto defendHer Majesty's empire and honour, ndia was a drain upon their resources. That fact prim4 facie called for the consideration of every statesman and of Parliament. There were a great many instances in history with which several of their lordships must be as conversant, or more so than himself, of great armies having deserted their standard, their Sovereign, and their country. They had at times gone over to the enemy, and had revolted against the lawful authority for another dynasty. They had risen up against foreig conquerors on behalf of their country when they thought that their revolt would be successfuL But was there anything in the pages of history in the slghtest degree he would not say parallel but even analogous to the existing state of things in India, in which 30,000 men had melted away from our command within the space of one fortnight, without any object, or purpose, or ostensible cause whatever? Ee defied any rational man to show that they had any definite object in the step which they had taken. Why, many of these men had already passed 12 or 14 or more years' service towards obtaining pensions for their lives. met their lordships recollect that this army was raised, not by conscription, bat by voluntary enlistment. Admission into its ranks was regarded as a prize by the natives of the country. And yet, of this army, without any cause-for he defied any one to say that there was any religious grievance ie the matter so far as the great body of the men were concerned -supposing the Hindoos had been subjected to greased cartridges, the Mahomedans would not have felt that to be a grievance, and of course the Hindoo soldier of all things had no desire to put himself in subjection to a Mahomedan instead of a Christian conqueror-of this army he said, 30,000 had without any assignable reason passed away froim our command. Was not the cause of that defection evident ? Was it not owing to the way in which that country had been governed? fit was. mismanagement that had brought that army into its pr&ent mutinous pondition, and that had made these men almost like a pack of schoolboys, excited, God know why, and God knew by whom, but certainly without any great object or leader to revolt. They had risen up against us, some of them had committed horrible and barbarous murders, while others showed great personal attachment to their officers, but they had gone from our standard, some to their homes and others it was impossible to say whither. To what was that owing but to the mal-organization of that army? Now, that was especially a matter in which the Court of Directors above every other body had the power of interfering. That army was directly officered by the East India Company. There was always a military committee of the East India Directors sitting, and, above all, those gentlemen who served in that direction had been in that army. They ought to have the greatest interest in it, and of all the branees of the East India Government they ought to be hold the moat responsible for the present state of things. But what was most reprehensible was the fact that nothing was done to avert that evil which when it did happen, those who knew anything at al about the Indian army said they were not surprised at. They were not prophets after the event. He was in a position, if necessary, to show their lordships a letter written by an officer of 14 yeari' experience in Indianot an officer in high civil employment, but one who continued with his regiment, and vho made himself acquainted with the feelings of his soldiers and of the army in general inIndia. That letter was written more than a year and a- half ago. It oontained a series of observations which he had made in previous letters upon the state of the army. The writer said in it, " I believe that we are upon the brink of a great outbreak." But was that all? Didnot tho noble earl opposite in a mostable and instructive speech, delivered by him about 10 days ago, clearly state to their lordships that he was informed while in India that the army in Bengal was in a state of insubordination ? Was it not a matter of history that that army required particular care? And yet not one stephad been taken to effect an improvement. Various causes had been assigned for this mutiny. Among others, it was said that, during the late war with Russia, foreign emissaries were employed in India in the endeavour to spread disaffection among the native soldiers. Whether that were true or not he could not say, but he believed that no power could stir up revolt among our troops if they were properly managed. That hypothesis, therefore, wholly failed to account for what had happened. There were various other causes with which their lordships were familiar. Among these was the way in which the army was constantly detached to perform duties in which the police ought to be employed. Changes, too, were made in regard to their pensions which were not sufficiently explained to the men. It was also supposed that the spolia. tion of the native chiefs and the annexation of their tesritory to ours had had some effect in producing a bad state of feeling in the army. The natives of India, it should be remembered, were won' to look upon us, not only as a most powerful, but as a most just people. A gallant friend of his who had served in India told him that he was in the habit of associating with the soldiers of his regiment and of aseertaining their feelings, and that he never found anything so difficult to answer as the questions they put to him as to the reason why the King of Oade was deposed and his territory annexed to the British dominions. There were many Ondeans in our army, and he vas informed that recent events in their native country had been viewed by them with dissatisfaction. But the principal cause of the d isaffection was the manner in which the army was officered. No doubt the Coart of Directors chose for the service young Englishmen possessed of the average qualities of their countrymen. The fault lay in the system of employment and promotion when those officers reached India. Among the various valuable suggestions for the improvement of the Indian army made by the late Sir C. Napier in his evidence before their lordships' committee was one for requiring young cadets. before going out to India, to pass some time in the army in Eugland in order to acquire a knowledge of their regimental duties. The reason why this was nut carried out was because it was only after a certain period of service in India that a person became eligible for thoge civil situations for which every young officer was looking out. The object of the parents of a cadet and of those who gave him his appointment was that he should hurry out as quickly as possible and qualify himself for a civil situation at the earliest moni0ct. What was the effect of thus draughting the officers of the army into the diplomatic and civil services ? Sir C. Napier gave an account of his visit to a battalion of 800 men to which there were only two European officers. One of them was a young ensign not then released from drill; and if anything had happcned to his senior, this boy, who could not pretend to drill company or even to march a guard, would have been placed at the head of 800 men, and in command of many native officers who thorouehly understood theirduty. How could we expect to find regiments in a proper state of dis- cime or organization under such a system? Ho had lately seen a friend of his whose son was in India, and on expressing sympathy with what he thought must be the natural feelings of the father at the danger in which his son was placed his friend coolly replied :-" Oh, I am not at all alarmed, my son has not been near his regiment for 12 years." On his hinting that the son, being a captain, would in the resent crisis be ordered to join his regiment, the father added, " Oh, no, there is no danger of that; my son is engaged in an important civil employment, collecting the revenue, and he cannot be removed from where he is." Was it surprising if an army so conducted could not be relied on in time of trouble ? This state of things appeared to have been entirely ignored by the Court of Directors. In Lord Dalhousie's minute of the 28th of February, 1856, there was this extraordinary passage - " If large improvements have been made under the various departments of civil administration during the last eight years, the military branch of the service has received its full measure of attention and amendment. The position of the native soldier in India has long been such as to leave hardly any circumstance of his condition in need of improvement." Then followed 48 paragraphs, relating not to the native but to the European soldier, or to the military board. They were told that the military branch of the Government had received its full measure of " attention and improvement ," and yet a few months later they had 30,000 men, the majority of whom had been long in the service, leaving their standard without any ostensible cause ! This subject did not, however, long escape the attention of the present Go. vernor-GeneraL Lord Cannimg assumed the government of India in March, 1856, and it soon became evident to him that all was not right; for as early as April the 5th in the same year his lordship wrote home to the Court of Directors that, "Your Hon. Court will observe that, in October, 1855, the late Governor-General reeorded a minute iD consequence of the strong representations of the late Commander-in-Chief as to the paucity of officers for the demands of the publio service." So little did the directors know whether the Bengal army required supervision that they sent increased employment upon the QiyI gXnvicq for officerB of the army, The Governor-General having Jo provide forthe government of the country, enormously inreased in population, with the samecivl frcetha exitedman rels go,was author. ized ho takoi from the regiments every field officei if he chose, and a large proportion of captains and lieutenants. hat was this but a wilful and mnonstrous exposure of the army to the risk of insubordination? The directors- "That the want is pressing we folly admit. It has been necessarily occasioned by the requisitions for staff and civil services, And for local and irregular corps, which could only be effectuAly met by transferring to th4n officers of the very Clas and description who are most urgently required for regimental duties, and who are best qualified to commaund the respeot and to conciliate the affections of every class ef the native soldiery. These considerations would have induced us to determine to allow two additional cap. tains to every regular native regiment in our service, but ia the actuAl condition of the finances we must confine ourselves to sanctioning your appointment of one additional captain and one additional letenant to every regiment of native infantry and cavalry of the regular formation in th three presidencies, and of two additional captains and tw; additional lieutenants to each European regiment; to hav | effect from the expiration of one month from the date o ur receipt of this despatch." w aat a system of Government! It appeared by the paper he held in hIs hand that at the time the directors were adding to the number of the officers of regiments they were reducing the number of soldiers. Such neglect of an army wanever exhibited byany Government before It was not surprising that the. recent calamity shouald have occurred under such management. He did not pretend to say what remedy should be applied, but he had seen some rather wild notions put forward which he hoped would not take much hold of the public zaind. He had seen it stated that the Government ought to do away with the high-caste Brahunins and Rajpoot soldiers, that they ought to .maintain 60,003 Europeau troops in India, and increase the number of irrVular soldiers. If theirlordships would read the history oftne Indian army, written in.1817, by Captain Williams, they would fiud that the high-caste Brahmins and Rajpoots were enlisted with a particular design. They were of a superior class, witk partioular religious notions, and it was thought they might counterbalance the great number of Mahomedans in our employ. He did not say that they ought to be continued for ever in our employment if they were not wanted, bat Sir J. aloolm, a competent - authority, had said of them, ina paper which did noa bear his name - "The Rajpoots wantenergy, but seldom, if ever, courage. It is remarkable of this class that, even when their animal spirits are so subdued as to cause a cessation of exertion, they show no fear of death, which they meet in every case vwth surprising fortitude or resignation. Such is the general character of a race of men whose numbers in the Bengal army amonnt to 30,000 or 40,000, andof whom we can recruit to any amount in our provinces. But this instrument of power must be managed with care and wisdom, or that which is our strength may become our danger." It was to be regretted that such opinions had not been attended to. Sir C. Napier said that if he remained 20 months in India and hliZ the power to organize or drill them, he should not be afraid to go into action with Sepoys alone. And elsewhero he mid, that properly drilled and organized, the native troops would march to Moscow. With regard to the irregular troops he admitted that they were valuable forces, but they were subject to the same influences as the Brabmins and Haipoots, and had shown instances of desertion as extraordinary and of mutiny as striking. In the Nepaul war in 1815, under Lord Hastings, when 6,000 irregular infantry were detached from the main body, they encountered a severe service, and fought from noon until 8 o'dock the next morning. They gained a great victory, but sustained a heavy loss. They afterwards made a claim for blood-money upon the number of men they had lost, and when it was refused they deserted in a body and went home. Then, if we had 60,000 Europeans in India, who was to pay the cost? It might be that they- would be cheaperthan three times that number of native troops, but look to the drain of such a reinforcement upon the regular army in this country. It was already felt as a great hardship when a regiment was kent a day longer in India than its term of service, and sucli a destination for so large an army could not but affect recruiting at home as well as diminish tha number of men available for European purposes. He had a great respect for the prolific powers of this country, but he doubted wvhether England, in addition to her other reqiements, could send out troops enough to India to keep down apopulation of 150,000,000 men. India, in such a case, would not be a very valuable acquisition. The truth was that British India belonged to the British Crown, and must be administered by a Ministerof the Crown responsible to Parliament. He had heard old Indians say that if Parlia. ment meddled with India party influences would prevail and India would be ruined. He zever heard such nonsense. It was nothing but an attack upon our whole system of constitutional government. History bore testimony to the fact that when the East Indi Company ere making their greatest struggles in India, when Otlive rwm raunning his wonderful career, and when Warren Hastings, the Marquis of Wellesley, and Lord Cormwallis administered the affairs of that country, those affairs were much more under the control of Parliamentary influence than was the case at the present day. That was a state of things which he for one thoughtwas toberegretted. and he therefore hoped that Her Majesty's Ministers would be prepared to meet Parliament next session with some scheme by which the administration of those territories belonging to the B,itish Crown in India would be brought more directly under the direction of the Govermnent in this country. If, however, unhappily they should fail to take that course he felt assured that the Legislature would take the matter into its own hands, and would not 5uffejz such practices as thosetowhichhehadadverted asprevailiug in the British army in India to continue-practices owing to which those officers to whose keeping great iaterests were committed were withdrawn from their legitimate profession, for merepurposes of personal profitand advantage. The papers for which he asked would, he vaticipated, throwlight upon the discussion upon the affairs of india. which must take place next year, and he therzore trusted that the Government would have no objection to theirz production. The noble marquis concluded by moving for copies of the correspondence of the Court of Directors with the Board of Control and with the Governor-General of India, relating to the amount of European forces, either of the Blritish or the Indian army, to be mantained in that country since the 1st of April, 1856, or relating to the employment of military officers upon political or other civil services. The Duke of ARGYLL said, that since the noble mar quis had given notice of his motion his right hon. friend the President of the Board of Control had laid upon the table of the other House of Parliament all the recent despatches relating to the question of the proportion which existed between the European and nativoe roops in India. Those documents would, he might add, be id. before their lordships, and the objoct which the noble marquis had in view would thus far be attained. Having made that stae. ment, he might be permitted to observe that, whatever might be the duty of an independent membQr of either branch of the Legislature in relation to the discussion of the causes of the great calamity which hadlately occurred in India,it would clearly be an act of imprudence upon the part of the Government to enter into any premature debate upon that most difficult subject, demanding, as It did, the mosanxious and lengthened consideration. The propriety of abstaining from all comment upon It would be still more apparent when their lordships reflected upon the different nature of the various suggestions made in almost every instance with an equal degree of confidence, which were promulgated in the public journals-as to the causesto which the present state of things in India was to be ascribed. Those suggestions appeared to take their colour from tho political and plarty feelings of the individualfrom whom they happened to emanate. One of them was to the effect that the mutiny in India was to be attributed to the manner in which England had dealt with the native States in that country, and n particular to what was designated the crael injustice to whicns the Ameer of Scinde had been subjected. Another reason for the existing disaffection was alleged to be the policy wvhich LJord Dalbousie had adopted in annexing new territories to our possessions in the East, the anexaation of Oade having been specially referred to as having caused the greatest dissatisfaction among the natives of India. A third reason which had been urged was the keepiag up of so many Indian States, which were, it was contended, a source of weakness to the Company- while a fourth reason was, it was alleged, to be fonndin the rapacity and injustice with which the native princes had been treated. Now, in order to prove tn their lordships how little force there was in the last-mentoned reason at all events, he might refer to a facb which had been mentioned in the intelligence conveyed by the last mail, and which was to the effect that some months since the Rajah of Gwalior had visited Calcutta and had been received by Lord Canning with every mark of attention snd respect-a line of conduct which his noble friend had carried to so great an extenb that he had actually been attacked by the press in Calcntta for the course which he had pursued. Hs noble friend, however, had not only paid the Rajah every attention to which as a person who governed his own territory in the most satisfactory manner he was entitled, but had taken occasion to Inform him that the people of this country would prefer to see the native princes ruling their own Possessions well, to seizing upon them in the name of the Crown of Great Britain, Tbat was the spirit in which his noble friend was disposed to deal with the native princes: and he might add that in the case of the Rajah of Gwalior the result of such a poly had turned out to be most beneficial, inasmuch as he ad been among the very first to place the forces under his control at the disposal of the Governor-GeneraL (Hear, hear.) It was however alleged, in addition to the reasons to which he had already adverted, that the cause of the recent disaffection in India was to be traced to the circamstance that no protection had been afforded to the ryot against the oppression of the zemindar-an evil, which among many others, had been mentioned in the petition whioh had in the early part of this year been presented from the Christian missionaries of the presidency of Bengal as calling for redress. Eardly, however, had that petition been presented, whe i another had been laid before the East India Government from the planters and zemindars, ascribing all the evils of wbich the missionaries complained to their own conduct ia endeavonring to force Christianity upon the natives. (Hear. bear.) Such were the conflicting statements which had beenmade upon the subject of the origin of the recent mutiny in India; but he believed that if there was one cause which was more generally supposed to have led to that mutiny than another it was the small number of European officers who were doing regimental duty in the Bengal army. Thatmighthavebeen a great evil, but its existence was not, he maintained, as the noble marquis seemed to imagine, to be laid altogether to the charge of the East India Company. They could have had no selfish moI tive in limiting the number of European offieers in India, i inasmuch as it was clearly their interest that'Athe amount of patronage in their hands should bd increased instead of diminished. That the numbei Of those officers was so small was in a great mseasure to be attributed to the very large addition to our dian possessions which had within the last 30 or 40 years taken i place; and was it, he would ask, the fact that the acquisition of that new territory was fairly to be ascribed to the olicy which the Board of Directors had shown themselves desirous to pure 9le, for Mis own part, believed the cotiary to be the fsct lasmsrch as he was of opinion that the Annexations which had of late been made to our territories In India were the resolt of necessity and of the direct action of those English sttesmen who had been sent out to India as Governors-General by the English Governm ment. The noble marquis, however, had madeone obeervatmin ia which he must express his entire concurrence, and which wasto the effect that the Government of this conntry ought not, in consequence of recent events in India, to abandon that confidence inL its native army which we had so long entertained. It by no means followed, he should. maintain, from the breaking out of that mutiny, that it was connectedwithany deepLaidschemeagainat Bntish authority. It had often happenedin othercountries that something like a momentary panic had led to a similar result. In the year 1848 a slmilar panic was spread throughout Europe, and even the British Uovernment, stable as thAt was, experienced condderable inconvenience, if not alarm. For hi6 own part, he thought it quite posible that, considering that the question of caste had been touched upon, the insurrection might be the result of a momentary panic, and not of any organized conspiracy. The arrival of the next mail was looked forward to with anxiety. It might turn out that the evil was more deeply seated than he at present believed it to be, but he thought that their lordshipe and the public ought not too hastily to abandon the opinion that it was possible to restore the Indin army to that state which had enabled it toreflect such glory on our arms. The duty of the Government was clear, and that was to put down the insurrection with a strong hand, and he was sure that their lordships would agree wiit him that no exertion should be spared and no sacrnfice r,ot sbmitted to in order to maintain that empire in India which had cast so much glory on this country, and the abandonment of which would nont only bea disgrace to England, but a calamity to man- The motion was tEen agreed to. TaE SUCCESSION DUTY. Lord REDESDALE, in presenting a petition from Mr. Damer! complaining of the interpretation put upon the succesion by the controller of legacy duties in regard to settlements made before the passing of that Act, said that the worling of the present Act was in many eases productive of great hardship. By the Act Imposing succesion duties, those duties were fixed at 1er cent, in thecase of a son, 5 per cent, in the case of a,eollitert. reltire, and*1l per cent. In the case of a stranger. It happened, however, in practice, that the authorities at Somerset-house ruled that when a son took property after his father in ccordancewith a previous settlement the duty whichbe to pay was not oneper cent., but the percentage which would ade had he taken the property at once without the intervention of the father. LadyCarolineDamerhad devised an estate to a Colonel Damer for life, with remainder to the firstandothersonsin tail ColonelDamerhad by adisentailng deed, executed before the Succession Daties Bil came into operation barred the entail. It had been held that the son of Colonel Damer was liable to pay a higher duty than 1 per cent., and certainly such a decision appeared to him to be an injustice, because it appeared clear that where a new title had been created it was upon that that the duty ought to be levied, It appeared to bimn that the whole question was one which required tevision, or at least that the Act itself should be made clear and intelligible, instead of being left as it was Intricate and con. f Used. Earl GRANVILE said that most of the points which had been taken by his noble friend were raised during the discassieon of the Succession Duties Bi3L As to the harshness of which complaint had been made, of course, if the rson who acted for the Crown in these matters did not ulfil his duty nothing more was heard of it, whereas if he collected the duty reaUy due every one who had it to pay complained. When this tax was imposed it was alleged that Ir. Gladstone had greatly underestimated the sum which it would produce, and that it would really in many cases amount to confiscation. Now, however, it turned out that the product of the tax amounted to only one-quarter of the sum estimated, but that in eight or ten years it might amount to one-half. As he understood thb case of Mr. Damer, it was that an aunt or cousin left property to his father for his lifetime, with remainder to himself. During the lifetime of the father, Colonel Damer, this entail was cut off, and in consequence his noble friend contended that the property was sublect only tothe lower tax If he was not mistaken, there was in tho Act a clause which exactly met this case, and provided that a disentail should( not avoid the payment of the duty. Something had been said as to the amount of ltigation to which this Act had led; but he had found upon inquiry that only three cases had been tried under it, that mn al these the decisions had been in favour of the Government, and that no attempt had been made to reverse th ose judgments. The Earl of DERBY agreed with his noble friend that there would be an objection to allowing disentails executed after the passing of this Act to avoid the payment of the tax; but the case alleged by the petitioner was, that the disentail was in this instance executed before the Act was passed, and therefore at the time it was passed the previous deeds were canceled. Therefore, the petitioner was charged by a retrospective operation, in virtue of a settlement which was not only executed but superseded before the passing of the Act, - The LORD CEIACELLOR stated that this was not a proper matter for a petition to their lordships, who were Rot now sitting as a tribunal in the last resort. The statute provided an easy and efficient remedy in these cases, which was open to the parties, and of which they might avail themselves. As far as be understood the case which had been brought before the House, the law appeared to have been properly interpreted. MIcr a few wqzdsfroni Lord RMsnALzS tha subject REGISTRATION OF LONG LEASES (SCOTLAND) BILL. This BiU was read a third time and passed. CONVEYANCE OF MAILM TO KIbNGSTOWN. Viscount DUNGANNON asked the noble dake the Postmaster.General whether a final arrangement had been come to between Her Majesty's Government and the Dablin Steampacket Company relative to the communication between London and Kingstown, and what the nature of that arrangement was as regarded the average time of the sea passage ? The Duke of ARGYLL was happy to inform the noble viscount that an arrangement with the Dablin Steampacket Company had been very nearly comdpleted, some points of detail only remaining to be settled. The Government had nothing to do however with determining the relative length of time to be devoted to the sea and to the land passages, their arrangement comprehending one Deriod for the entire distance, bat he believed that at present the company estimated that the sea passage would occupy three Dours and 45 minutes, which he thought was ample time for the purpose. It was a high rate of speed no doubt, but it was not much more than had been done by the Banshee and by some: of the faster packets on the station. The Marquis of CLANRICARDE hoped that when the arrangement should be completed the papers would be laid Upon the table. REFORMATORY SCHOOLS BILL. On she motion of the Earl of HAnnowBy this BiU was read a second time, ENCLOSURE ACTS AMENDMENT BILL. This Bill was read a third time and passed. COMMONS ENCLOSURE BILL. This Bill was read a second time, INDUSTREAL SCHOOLS BILL. The Earl of SHAFTESBIJRY said, there were a great many institutions in the country for the reception of criminul children, aud it was very desirable to encourage the establishment of industrial schools to which vagrant children should be admitted who would otherwise be trainedinhabits of vice. This object was Proposed by the BiU of which he now had charge, and which was originally introduced in the other House by Sir Stafford Northuote, but was afterwards (Sir Stafford not being returned to the present Parliament) taken up and passed by Mr. Adderley. The provisions of the Bil wero entirely of a voluntary character, bat these institutions would be entitled, on being duly certified, to the receipt of grants from the Privy Council. Parents were made responsible for the goodbehaviourand might becalled upon to contribute to the maintenance of their children wVirle in these schools. He hoped their lordships would feel no hesitation in giving this Bill a second reading, and in committee such alterations could be introduced as were thought necessary. Lord BROUGCAAM said the loss to this and every other vood cause by the non-retura of Sir Stafford Northcote to arliament was grear, but his place so far as regarded this measure had been well supplied by Ir. Adderley, who in carrying the Bil through the other House had straggled successfully against considerable difficulties. As to its details there might be some doubt, but there could not be the leaIst with respect to its principle. A noble friend of his (Lord Stanley) whose absence from this House he rejoiced ar, inasmuch as he could Dot sit here untilhis noble friend (Earl of Derby) was no more, had taken a very active and useful pars in the discussion upon this Bil, the subject of which was very minutely considered at the great meeting at Bristol over which Lord Stanley had with such ability presided. He (Lord Brongham) hoped there would be no objection to the second reading. The E arl of DE;RBY entirely approved the princinle of the BilD, butas probably hesehould not be in the Eouss wnen it was in committee, he wished to call attention to tbe definition of the word " parent," which was madeto include ny one uDpon whom an order of affiliation had been made. That certainly was introducing a new definition into our law, and he thought the point worthy of consideration. The Bil was then read a second time. The Militia Ballots Suspension Bill and the Putblic Health Act (Aldershott) Bill were read a second time. The House adjourned at 25 minutes past 7 u'clock,

' Sir D. L.

Mr. LABOUCHERE repUed that he had received no offioial account of the transactions, to which the hon. and gaUant member referred, but hehad seen several private letters relating to the subjeo«--of his question. Many hon. gentlemen were aware that on two or three occasions within the last few years the Assembly ot the Ionian Islands had .tan early period after their meeting, passed resolutions among directly at the maintenance of the connexion between England and those islands. The practice had been as soon as such resolutions were adopted, to prorogue the Assembly forthwith. Ih the present year the Ionian Assembly had not pursued the same course, but they bad sat for several weeks, during which they had transacted business without adopting any resolution which could necessitate or justify the extreme measure of prorogation. He learned, however, from privateletters-for hehad received no official information-that very intemperate language had been used, butalthoughgreat excitement hadprevaUed in the Assembly^ no formal resolutions similar to those agreed to on former occasions had been adopted. He beUeved those scenes were attributable to tha strange and singular misapprehension of a petition which had been presented to a right hon. gentieman opposite from Mr. Montgomery Martin, asking that the Ionian Islands might be so far treated as a British colony that one member representing those islands should have a seat in the British House of Commons. Some members of the Ionian Assembly entertained the idea that such a petition wouldnot have been presented if there had not been an intention on the partof Her Majesty's Government to deprive the islands of their independent charaoter. It was alleged that a similar petition had been circulated in Corfu but that was found not to be the case. There could be no doubt, however, that very intemperate language had been used in the Ionian Assembly. The Government were quite awareof the necessity of watebing proceedings of thisde. scnptlon, but he bebeved that up to the present moment no -.|P.f»d.beett taken by the Ionian Assembly which would justify its prorogation.

On the motion of Lord Palmerston, tho orders of the day were postponed until after Mr. DisraeU had brought on his motion relating to India. THE STATE OF INDIA. Mr. DISRAELL-Sir, I hardly know whether there i anything more interesting-I am sure there are few thing more instructive-than to recall tho commencement o great events. It is remarkable how insignificant incidents at the first blush have appeared which have proved to hi pregnant with momentous consequences, and that in a street riot at Boston and at Paris began, in fact, the two great revolutions of modern tunes. Who would have sup posed, when we heard first of the rude visit of a Russian saUor ftom a port in the Black Sea to Constantinople, tha we were on the eve of ona of the greatest of modern wars and on the solution of one of the most difficult of poUtica problems? And so, a few weeks ago, when a paragraph ap peared in_ our journals that there was a mutiny in a native regiment in India, I dare say few people read the paragraph I dare say, indeed, most persons turned for amusement to the more exciting discussions in this House on questions of domestio interest or of comparative insignificance; and if the tranquil course of the House of Commons thi3 year did not afford them even this resource, thoy were, I dare say, more interested in tbe stimulating adventures of the police courts. But, Sir, I havo always thonght if mankind could bring themselves to ponder in timo on the commencement of those events that greatly affect their fortunes and destiny it is possible that we might bring to the transaction of affairs' raore_ prudence aud more energy than are generally exercised at the commencement of such incidents, and that probably we might prevent many puMio dis asters and calamities. It was witb that feeling, Sir when the first news arrived of the occupation of Delhi by the rebels, that I thought I was only performing my duty in addressing some inquiries to Her Majesty's Government as to their opinions witb regard to the cause of those remarkable events and tho exact position of affairs. lam bound to say that at tbe time the answer which I received topressed me with the feeling tbat Her Majesty's Ministers , did not view the events whioh had occurred in that spirit I which I thought their latent importance deserved. The I House wfll recoUeot the information that was afforded by , the Government on that occasion.

LOADOA', TUESDAY, JULY28, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, The Royal Assent was given by Commission to a great many Bills. Lord DErIsY again called the attention of the House to the absolute necessity which existed for fixing some day after which no new Bill, except it were one of pressing importance, should be read a second time. After some little discussion it was agreed that after A ugust the Tth no Bill, except it were of the nature indicated, should be read a second time. Lord CLANRICARIDE in a speech of considerable length called the attention of the House to the condition of the Indian army, and concluded by moving for certain correspondence bearing on the subject. The Duke of ARotYLL stated that the papers moved for had been already laid on the table of the Lower House, and would also be laid before their -lordships. With regard to tho subject in general on which the lMlarquis of CLA.NRIOAJRDE had spoken the House might be sure that the Government were determined to put down the insurrection with a high hand, and to spare no exertion to main. tain our Iidian empire. Some other business was then despatched, and their lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, in reply to a question put by Sir DBI LACY EVANS, Mr. LADOUCHERE said he had received no official information upon the subject, but he had learnt from private letters that intemperate language had been used and great excitement exhibited in the Assembly of the lonian Islands, but no formal resolution had been comae to that would justify the extreme measture of prorogation. In answer to Sir J. PAIUNGrTON, Lord PAIDMERSTON said HER MIAJESTY's Government had received no telegraphic message from India. | Mr. DISRAELI, pursuant to notice, called the attention of the lHouse to the state of affairs in India. After noticinig the suddenness of the intelligence of the mutiny among the native troops, which had taken the Government by surprise, their impression being that it would speedily pass away, he observe(l that even after they had time to consider the events the House had been told by a principal member of the Cabinet,-the CrIANcmLLou of the ExcHEQuER,-as the result of its mature opinion, that the revolt of the Bengal army was a sudden intpulse, occasioned by a superstitious feeling. It was of the greatest moment that the House should have a clear notion of the cause of these events. It was said to be on1ly a military mutiny; but it was of prmary importance to know whether it was a military mutiny or a national revolt. He presumed, therefore, to address the House upon two points of inquiry-first, what were the causes of the present state of affairs in India; and, when the House had arrived at a conelusion upon that point what were the proper measures which, uuder the circumstances, should be adopted. That the state of the Bengal ariy had been unsatisfactory the House knew from the fiery criticisms of the late Sir CRARLES NAI'IER and the calmer reflections of Lord MELVILLE; but he contended that the mutineers in the Bengal native armny were not so much the avengers of their own individual injuries as exponents of general discontent, and that they had at last been drawn into its vortex. He ranged under three heads the various causes which, in bis opinion, had led to the general discontent of all classes with our rule-namely, first, the forcible destruction of native authority in India by our Government; second, the disturbance of the settlement of property; tbird, tampering with the religion of the peop)le. Directly or indirectly, the principal causes of the public disoontent in India ranged, he contended, under these three heads. Under the first head he referred to what he termed the new policy of the annexation of States on the ground of the failure of natural heirs, although adoption wAS sanctioned by the Hindoo law, and he specified particular instances, including those of the well known Rsjah of SATTARAnI and the Rajah of BeR,R. These violations of the Rindoo law, he observed, shook the confidenice inot 6nly of princes, but of large and potwerful parties. This led him to the second head, and he argued that as the law of adoption applied to landed proprietors our newv system touched all jaghirodars and possessors of enam lands. Inquisitions had also been prosecuted into the titles to landed estates, and he believed that the amount obtained by the Indian Goversisnent by the resumption of estates was not less in Bengal alonie than 500,0001. a-year, vhile in Bombay, he had been assured, the annual amount was 370,OUO0. The Government had further reduiced guaranteed pensions by curtailment and coilversion into annuities. All these proceedinxgs had, he said, estranged numerous classes from our authority. He novi proceeded to the last head -tampering with the religion of the people; and here he hesitated in attributing any part of this cause to missionary efforts. So for from the t Hindoo looking with suspicion on the missionary, he iyas convinced that I he Nvas ready to discuss any point of religion. But what the Hlidu(loo did regard with dread and apprebension was the inion of missionary enterprise with tbe power of the Government. He was much misinformed if the Government had not furnished ground for suspicion in relation to native eduoation; but there had been two Acts passed within these few years by the Legislative Council of India whieh had greatly disquieted the religious mind in Hindostan. One enacted that no man should lose his: property on account of. changing his religion; the other permitted a Ilnidoo widow to, marry a. second husband. | Both these Acts had spread the greatest alarm and disturbance among the Hindoos. Mr. DisÃ¯Â¿Â½IzrAm then adverted to the "startlina, event' of the annexation of Oude, the consequence of which, he said, was to inspire- the.Mahommedan princes with apprehension, and to inite them in a common cause with the Hindoos. Re had been informed, besides, that in our Bengal regiiments there were no fewer than 70,000 natives of Oude, who, in returning to their villages, would find them in the possession of the East India Company, and those who were owners of land would be subject to the bard and gevere system of our land revenue. It was after this event that the circulation of symbols in the forms of cakes and lotus flowers throughout the Bengal army proved the existence of a general conspiracy. He thought it was impossible that the Indian Government could have been ignorant that the Bengal troops were in a state of chronic insubordination, and it was their duty solemnly to impress upon the Government at home, and they must have done so, that the time had come when they mustseriously consider the state of our Indian army. The greasing of the cartridges Mr. DisRAsTr dismissedwith the remark thatnobodybelievedthat to have been the real, cause of the outbreak. In | the last place he proceeded to inquire, assuming that the views he had developed were correct, what were the measures which the Government ought to adopt in the emergency. Regarding the revolt as a national one, iilitary measures were not sufficient, ancd the measures of the Government were inadequate; there should be an expedition up the Indus; our force in India should badoubled. ]But, further, the population of India should be told that there is a future hope; they should be taught at once that the relations between them and their Sovereign, Queen VrOrORIA, would be drawn nearer; and a Royal comminission should be sent from the QunER to India to inquire into the grievances of all classes. He concluded by moving for certain papers. Mr. V. SaiTH could not help asking what was the use of Mr. DISsnA1LI'S three hours' oration, and whether there was not very great mischief in bringing forward this subject in the manner he had done? He had represented the mutiny as a national revolt, but he had adduced no evidence to show that it was owing to national discontent. No native prince had been concerned in it, and there was not a shadow of evidence of any conspiracy among the native princes. The system pursued by Lord DARousiu in regard to adoption might be right or wrong, and before that question was decided the law of succession in each State must be inquired into; but this subject had no connexion whatever with the revolt.. With regard to the disturbance of property there had been a commission to inquire into enam lands, some of which had been acquired by fraud and corruption, and this may have created a good deal of discontent among certain classes. The interference with religion was a matter of immense delicacy; and he had no hesitation in saying that it would be the best policy at once to inter:ere and prevent theexereise of missionary zeal by our civil and military servants. He coincided with Mr. DrsRAYmL entirely in thinking interference with the religion of the natives of India highly objectionable. On the subject of annexation, he was an enemy to systematic annexation ; but the question of Oude was this: the subjects of Oude were kept in subjection by our force, and we made ourselves responsible for everything the King did; Lord DAluOUsIE, therefore, thought it better to annex the territory, which was done with the least possible injury to the parties concerned. The attempt, to connect this annexation with the mutiny had completely failed. He denied that the Government had received any warning of the mutiny, or that there was the slightest indication of any disaffection among the native troops. Lord DALUIOUSIE and Sir W. Go= had borne testimony to their loyal spirit down to a very late period, and he did not believe that Sir C. NAPIER had made any representation to the Indian Government founded upon the criticisms he had left behind. It was premature to say what was the . real cause of the mutiny; but he thought there must have been some mismanagement at Meerut, and mismanagement at the beginning (iften led to serious' esults-in such cases. There had been of late years a severance between the men and their offices a in the native regiments, and he was sorry to hear that the latter sometimes spoke of the Sepoys at their mess as "niggers." After reviewing other portions of MIr. DhsitoAE'fs speeeb, Blr. SmrxH proceeded to consider the remedies he had proposed. The sending a Royal Commission would, in the first place, superEede the Governor-Gencral, which would be, he thought, one of the moat fatal errors that could be committed. Then Mr. DISRAELI would connect the name of the QuusiN withlthe whole Administration; but the present tmachinery of the Indian Government had been deliberately approved by the Legislature. He thought, however, that it might be advisable, with the sanction and authority of the Governor-General of India, to send out a commission, not to supersede him, but to inquire into various matters, aud, among others, the re-organization of the native army, certain points connected with which Mr. SMITH indicated as worthy of consideration. Sir E. PERRy observed that Mr. DISRAELi had treated this question as an Indian question ought to bo treated in that House-without any referencej to party politics. The grave question was whetherI this revolt was confined to the army, or was a reflex of the national mind, and his deliberate opinion was that the military revolt was sympathized with throughout the country. He agreed, too, with Mr. DISRA1SLI as to the causes of this symDathy, esipecially the new policy of annexation, and the resumption doctrine, wvhich invalidated titles of 40 years' standing. lIe wished, he said, that Mr. Dxssc&sr had broaght forward at an earlier period his views upon a question which had been too much nieglected. Mr. CvNiPBELL, on the contrary, declared he had never heard a more unpatriotic and injudicious speech than Mr. DISBAEL'S. Mr. WYnITESIDE detailed at some length the opinions of Sir C. NAPIER, who, when commanding the army in' India, communicated to the Indian GovernTnent, he said, his opinion of the Bengal troops, and distinctly stated that Delhi ought to be defended by 12,000 picked men. He cited other proofs that the Government were aware of the necessity of reorgani7ing the Bengal army, and of increasing the European force upon that establishment. Mr. DIssaAiu, he observed, had raised questions of great interest; one was that a large number of the mutinous Sepoys had been enlisted in .ude, and t.he petitions of some of them, in referenlce to land in Oade, were not answvered; and this, he contended, mnst have made an impression upon their minds; and must, of course, have influenced their actiona. Lord J. RUSSF.LL said he had no wish that the House shouild enter upon this discussion, and, in presence of xwhat had been rightly termed an awful calaulity, he could not conceive anything less tending to the advantage of this country or of India than such a discussion, if it was to end either in a vote of censure, or a transfer of India to the Crown. Neither of these measures was proposed in the motion, which was only for the production of papers. Mr. DISRAELI, he observed, had never ventured to say that the great mass of the people of Tndlia had suflered under oppression. It appeared to him that we had trusted rather too much to Indian troops, and troops of one particular kind, and have bad too large an army. Be thought that 50,000 Europeans and 100,000 natives would afford a far better security than our present force. The first matter, however, upon which the House of Comimons ought to pronounce an opinion was that the Government out to be supported; he thought the House ought not to separate without expressing such opinion, and he accordingly moved. by way of amendment an address to HER MAJESTY, to assure HER M IAJESTY that they will support HEn MAJESTY in any eff(irts necessary to suppress the disturbances in India and iu any measures required for the establishznernt of tranquillity. Mr. MAYGLES dwelt, upon the universal goodfeeling of the plinces, landholders, and people of India. II the Punjabl he said, the population were with uS to a man. HI explained the principleupon vhich Lord DAMiOuSIm had acted in the matter of adoption, and stated the case of the Rtajah of SATTAEA in some detail. Be denied that the Indian -Government had been warnea. of- the sta6te of the Bengal arnmky, and he read fxom official reports of Sir C. NAPEp., in which ha.spoke in the warmest teims of the native treojs,, j".L have neyer seen,"' he said in a general order in 1853, "a more obedient or a snore bionourable army." ,He noticed a few other points in Mr. DTsRAx'f s speech. Mr. ImDDXnr observed that the amendment was IOCnOnguouS with the motion, and inqjuired of the Chair whether it was not coinpetent to the House, without negativing the amendment, to agree to the original inotion calting for inform3tion. N'o reply was gYiven by the SPEA7.ER, andi Mr. AYRTON moved that the debate be adjourned; but this motion wasnegatived, upon a division, by .203 to 79. After some remarks by Mr. AyrTO2; and Mr. IADPIELD, and P spirited and sarcastic reply from 1r. DISRAE,I, explanations followed from Air. AaiA,LE$, Lord J. Russ=, and Mr. T. BARNG, who remioved certain misconceptions of Mr. DisRAELt regardling the proceedings of the East India Committ3e of 1852, and who condemned the course he had.taken that night. Ptord 4RSPAtISTON could not but express his regret that Mr. DissnAsLi holding the prominent position he did, should bave selected a moment of great diffic.ilty for the expression of the opinions which the House had heard. He should not enter into the question at that late hour; he was satisfied to rest it upon' the speeebes of Mr. S-%Erm and lr. MAGoLES, which would serve as antidotes to those opmions. General Thousoio observed that no notice had beentaken-it the debate of abreach of military faith and honour towards the soldiers of the Indian native army. The original motion was then negatived, and Lord J. Rus5ELV's amendment carried without a division. The orders of the day were then disposed of, and the House adjourned at 2 o'clock.
An interval of Seventeen days between the arrivaIs of Indian intelligence alows the subject to go through considerable phases. We first dwell with amazement or grief on the more prominent facts; then eagerly collect the particulars pouring in through papers and private letters; and then subside into the mood of rational inquiry. No doubt, with greater presence of mind, it is possible to go through these stages more quickly, and, before the arrival of a new Mail, to construct an Essay, a History, or anything you please out of the contents of the last. Mlr. DisniAw has favoured us with a Treatise on the causes of Indian disaffection, and he has evidently thought it an object to publish his theory before the possibility of corTection by the news now painfully expected every hour. On the suggestion of the tidings that Delhi remained in the hands of the mutineers, now increased to 26,000, he has applied himself with great diligence to draw up an indictment against our Indian policy. With a very proper view to securing the attention of the House for three hours, he has selected just the three causes-three, neither more nor less-that afforded most scope for illustration. There is a necessity in these things. A three-act drama can only have a certain number of incidents and, characters, and, whoever your hero, whether CHARPLES XII., or Louis XI., or the Duke DE RICHELIEU, YOU cannot range at large through a long and divcrsifted career. You must select your topics, and do so with an eye to the taste of the audience. That this has been done with dramatic propriety and some rhetorical effect in this instance we are ready to admit, but the India Company and the Indian policy are Mr. DisiAnfs subjects, and got up with a view to artistic effect. There is hardly a word in his speech that might nct have been spoken a year ago, or ten years ago, with as much propriety as now,-nay, with greater, for the simple reason that none of his causes received any colour from the actual accounts of the muliny. Throughout the whole of the vast mass of particulars that has now been published on tlhis calamitous.affiir, neither- in the-acta .orthe words of the mutineers nor in those of the people can anything be found to justify the ingenious hypothesis that the revolt has arisen from the three particular causes, or any one of them, selected by Ir. DiSuAELI. If we are to look to the accounts themselves for the causes of this outbreak we find a want of sympathy and communication between the Earopean officers and the native troops; we find much made of a pretence that certainly ought never to have been afforded; we find, on the occasion of the Meerut outbreak, an excessive severity without any precaution against its probable consequences; wo find a most unaccounitable want of the miitary dispositions that miglht have been expected to be made when the arnmy was notoriously in a disaffected state; we find the revolt chiefly confined to the soldiery, the population being at least as much for us as against us; we find the King of DEmLr made the nucleus of the insuirrection, but Oude hept in order. That an immenss native army,-highly paid, comfortably housed, kept long in the same stations, with their wives and families about them, officered chiefly by their own people, having very little intercourse with their conquerors, and increasing communication between the different regiments and stations,-should wish to throw off the yoke of a distant nation, alien in race, in language, and in religion, does not require to be accounted for, and certainly does not require three hours to explain. We have been told fifty times during the last fifty years that the native army would revolt some day or other, and it has revolted. There is nothing to show that its temper is really worse now than it has ever been before, excepting only in the possibly diminished respect for the European officers, justified principally by their paucity and youth. That there should be an actual revolt, and tl at it should have a temporary success, is an accident that ought to have been more guarded aoainst. Such we hold to be the view of this revolt naturally suggested by the narratives themselves. But we look in vain for the influence of dethroned Kings and Rajahs; we caunot see how these regiments would have been more faithful had we allowed every Hindoo chief an unlimited right of transmitting his sceptre through an adopted heir. WLte do not detect any pervading grievance or word about lapsed titles, it having been admitted on all sides that to the soldier, at least,-and this is an affair of soldiery,-the Company has been the most liberal aad most honest of paymasters; tlhen, as for rcdigion, Mlr. DISRAELI himself acquits the missicnaries of zeal without discretion, and inculpates our schools, our abolition of a penal lIw against conversion, and the permission given to widows to contract a second marriage. Perhaps it miglht be enough to observe that these things have never once been mentioned throughlout the recent intelligence. But, if they had, we cannot think- it improper in oiur position in India to educate the people, to permit widows to marry, inste?d of generally taking another coiurse, and to allow the native idolators to profess our faith witbout being punished with the loss of all their property. The nature of Mr. DISRAELIS theme requires an extensive sacrifice of political purpose to historical effect. His retrospect of Indian mismanagement goes back confessedly ten or twenty years, but really to the very beginning of our empire, for there was no time whatever, and could be no time, wher we were not obnoxious to the dislike anc suspicion of the natives from our interference with tLeir thrones, titles, customs, and creed.. This- can only be a question of, degree. There will always b9 some change; thc;V would;6e under any gover-nment; and we could not ugssib1y conduct ther government of fdia without some encroachments on its institutions. It has been a necessity not only to guard, but to extend its frontier; to maintain an immense army; to protect property and life as they never were protected before; to get rid of customs merely engrafted on Hindooism by the cupidity of the priesthood; to create by education a class of more useful and possibly less superstitious dependents; to extinguish centres of corruption and revolt in the heart of our empire; to simplify and invigorate our system. This and much more are comprised in the grand design of governing India from this metropolis. It could not be done without arms, without men, without money, and there was need of a large revenue. When a revenue is to be collected from myriads of people, al of them poor and simple, many half savage and turbulent, there will, of course, be dissatisfaction and trouble. There will, too, be some appearance of injustice. But a revenue there must be, unless -we wouild adopt the practice of the native Princes, and have regular forays, confiscations, and forced contributions of all kinds. India has never been so heavily taxed as this country. But, after all, though lIr. DisRAELI imports taxation, the settlement of land, the resumption of titles, and all sorts of property grievances into the question, and though he gives ns a lamentable picture of the mutineer returning to his village in the State of Oude and finding a brother or a stranger in possession of his patrimony, yet, in point of fact, there has been no allusion to this class of grievances throughout the affair. The perpetrators of the revolt have not been plundered, impoveriiabea nie, the b1aikÃ¯Â¿Â½upti of fortune; men whose only chance was in arms. On the contrary, the insurgents have been those very men whom we maintained in unexampled c(mfort and splendour by the very measures to which Mr. DisRAEu ascribes their disaffection. The native soldier has been the spoilt child of England. Other classes, indeed, may have had to pay heavily for his support, but if we have oppressed India it has been for him; and it is he, not the resident proprietor or peasant, who has turned his arms against us. To purely rhetorical exercise such as that of Mr. DISRALI, which blamed no Administration in particular, proposed no measures, and ended only in calling for papers, it is hard to say what was the best answer. Lord Jomq RuSS,LL, however, hit the occasion, and met with the unanimous support of all sides by an amendment proposing an address to HEE MAJrESry pledging the House to all the measures necessary for the preservation and security of our Indian Empire. That, of course, is now the duty, and should be the rivalry, of all parties. This must be done at any cost and at every risk; it certainly will be done, and Air. DisR-AEI, whatever his intentions, may take credit for having given the House an opportunity of committing itself to this great work.
We, the Britons, " divided from the whole "world," have very little knowledge of the soul of a Revolitionist. The foreign Democrats who live ainong us are not of us. They may have escaped from Spandau or Mantua, or the dungeons of Naples, or the dungeons of Spain, their adventures may be had on the bookstalls for is., and their photographs may be exhibited on panels as specimens of ait, but neither their achievements, nor their hairbreadth escapes, nor their romantic couutenances engage much of the attention of our busy people. They have their party, but no public. There are Englishmen and Englishwomen who believe in refugees, who not only extend to them the help due to the unfortunate but the confidence which ought to be earned only by high achievements or proved worth1- or at least ordinary success. In spite of failures more or less shameful, in spite of massacres, proscriptions, executions in effigy, deportations, and the like, a few hotheaded enthusiasts still follow the lead of the notorious Democrats of Europe, or rather obey their commands, for these master minds of Revolution are too often more prone to place others in the post of danger than to occupy it themselves. But to the great mass of our people refugee thought and speech and customs are hidden mysteries. Many of us have been apt to think that the Democratic leaders throughout Elurope must by this time have learnt wisdom. Putting aside past failures, the events of the last 10 years would seem enough to teach them diffidence in themiselves and in the speedy triumph of iheir cause. At the beginning of this period Louis PHiLiPPE was on the throne of France, supported by Chambers where at least there was free speech and free voting; Austria still preserved something of the paternal system which had tempered so many years of despotism ; Italy was beginning to move, and amid bickerings and discontent was advancing in the path of material progress. What was the state of things within 1S months of the time that the Revolution " made the " tour of Europe ?" Simply, that triumpliant military force had made the same tour; that in every capital where a mob had ruled a garrison was installed, and the tribune was everywhere displaced by the bureau. The general feeling in this country is, that the revolutionary leaders must see the vanity of their hopes and the iniquity of the means tbey employ; that common sense must teach them that the present is not the time, nor the continental countries of Europe the field, for waging their warfare against actual society. But we certainly know little of the deep fanaticism which is bred in those gloomy breasts, is nourished by the perpetual intercourse of one injured or suspicious spirit with another, and bursts into a flare under the influence of opportunity. lWhether the Democratic leaders be communing in the caf6s of Venice or Naples, or affecting conviviality in some paltry eeslanzinet of Paris, or talking loudly and freely in the purlieus of Soho, they seem urged by the same wild impulse which takes count neither of timne nor fitness, which disregards any change which years or circumstances or the policy of rtulers or the progress of the governed may have made since they, the conspirators, were hurled from dignity and power, or diiven from domestic comfort to wander tbrough the world. If an instance be required of what a thorough Revolutionist is capable, we may give the so called " will' of ColonelPISAoARNE, thechief of the last insurrection in Calabria. It is one of the most surprising things to Euglishmen to see energy, dauntless courafge, and steady tenacity of purpose based upon dreams which they can hardly imagine that any one seriously believes in. But hear the words of a man -who did not skulk behind and send others to fight for him, but who headed an expedition and fell with it :-" At the " moment," he says, " when I am about to risk "my life in a rash undertaking I wish to make "known mny opinions. I believe in Socialism, "but in a differen)t Socialism from the French " systems, all more or less foimded on the despotic "idea which prevails in the nation. The Socialism "to which I allunde may be comprised in the two "words ' Liberty and Association;" and so on. Here is this man gOilg to meet the bullet or the gallows among the hills of Southern Italy, and he sets about explaining his social system like seoie HALRIIGTON or HoBnEg, and telling all who wiU read the dboiumelt after bis. death that ho is. about .to light for the opinions he bas formed aftei a six years' study. He adds&thoA to his volianes. composed on the subject . he has been i.wable from want of time to inpartLhe last 9.aW of.diction; he is therefore desirous that some friend shoul replace him, and publish his work after due correction. So much for the enthusiasm with whiclt a modern Democrat holds his dpinions, and the coolness with which he wMil do battle in their cause. But wiat are these opinions? What is the value of the results ativhich the thinkera of Continental Europe atrive aftei kifh earnest contemplation that the brain is fired aind tlle heart beats for an opportunity of' asserting them even by force of arms? " I am convinced," says Colonel PisAoAnwXN "that railways, electric telegraphs, machinery, "improvements in' manufactures-in fact, all "that developes and facilitates commerce, is "destined by an inevitable law to impoverish "the mass ofthi people; until a division of thepro"fits is made by co'mpetition:". "If these pre"tended ameliorations are regarded as a progress, "it will only be in this sense-that, by increasing "the misery of the people, they will infallibly "impel them to a terrible Revolution." This may Fe taken is the Vltra-Democrat's creed respecting material progress,-as his mode of viewing the character of the present age. Peace, prosperity, enterprise, civilization, are so many injuries, since they tend to make people tolerant of their present lot,, and so to defer that great Revolution which alone can place men in a position for enjoying trae happiness. Mlonarchs, or statesmen, or philanthropists, who seek to develope prosperity before the fair division of its benefits has been established, are so many traitors to, hmDanity, who 8eek to govern mankind by pandering to their lower instincts and satisfying their most &rovellinc wants. Hence the Government of Piedmont is branded not only with iniquity, but with deceit. " I am convinced that temperate "remedies, such as the constitutional system in "Piedmont and the progressive improvements im "Lombardy, far from advancing the regeneration "of Italy, can only retard it. For my own part, I "would not make the smallest sacrifice to change a "Ministry or to obtain a Constitution.... The "domination of the House of SAVOY and tha "domination of the House of AusrTP.TA are exactly "the same thing." As we are looking at this man's last words merely in a spirit of curiosity we need express no opinion on the sentiments here recorded. What we wish to notice is simply this,that there exists in Europe a body of men, many of whom are willing to go to death for their opinions, who believe that all that science and commerce and education do for mankind is merely evil, who hold aU States not Democratic to be equally bad, and that no country can advance to true prosperity except. through a series of tumults. and revolations. Indeed, the Colonel says plainly, " Conspiracies, " plots, attempts at insurrection, are, in my " opinion, the series of facts through which Italy "is moving on to her object-Unity." Thus we see what sort of men these Republican leaders are. We speak of the most sincere of them-the men who are willing to land with a handful of followers on a hostile coast, to march boldly on the first town, and trast to PRovIDExcs or Fate, or whatever they worship, for tbe result. There is no reason to believe that the opinions of MI. Pis-cAumn aredifferentfrom the opinions oF1zI.zzNr or the ultra French Democrats. The polity they demand exists nowhere in the world. England is, of course, out of the question; the Swiss grovel in abject superstitions; the Americans are subdued by a degrading commercialism, and so forth. To establish by force a Commumistic society in a purely Democratic State, held together by the worship of Nature, is the dream of the UltraRepublicans aU over Europe, and we may as well recognize at once that the things to which we have given the names of liberty aud security and social right are looked upon by them merely as paltry bribes to seduce men from their pursuit of political perfection.

SECOND EDITION. THES TIMBS3-OFFICE, Tuday Moming. EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris corre. rpondent, dated yesterday (MIonday), 6 p.m.:- The Emperor leaves Plombiares to-morrow at noon for ChLons-sur-Marne, where he passes the night. The chief administrator of the Eastern Railroad Company set out this morning from Paris to meet him at EpinaL The Emperor is expected in Paris on Wednesday evening next. A medal commemorative of the laying of the first stone of the new building at Plombirres is about to be atruck at the Mint. The medal will be inscribed with the words xpoken on that occasion by the Emperor. Several foreign officers have at their request been pormitted by the Minister of War to be present at the manceuvres at the camp of Chailonssur-Marne, which are to commence next month. The Duke of Rivas, the newly-appointed Aubassador of the Queen of Spain to the Court of the Tuileries, arrived here yesterday. The Bey of Tunis has, it is said, granted an indemnity to the family of the Jew who was lately mnx dered by the rabble. At the demand of the European Consuls severe measures are to be adopted to prevent the repetition of such scenes. The French Government, which had not been informed by telegraph of the result of the elections in Moldavia, on the 39th inst., has received a despatch on that subject from the French Consull at Jassy. It is believed that France wiU demand that these elections shall be annulled, and that it will ba proposed to regulate, at a Congress to be held in Paris, the various points of detail raised by the question of the Principalities. Supposing all that is said about illegality be true, with the recollection of the late French elections so fresh before us, it is amusing to see this Government all of a sudden so squeamish about electioneering morality. A letter froea Jassy, of the 13th, says, that the conduct of the Turks at Ismail had become Intolerable, and that it is calculated to exasperate those who are most friendly to the independence of Turkey. Some days previously a band of Turks crossed theDanube, under pretence of visiting the old fortress of Ismail, and on arriving there they ascended to the belfry, and alarmed the whole population by violently ringing the bells. They entered the churches smoking, and insulted the images of the Saints. The population could no longer restrain their indignation; they rushed on them, and struck them. It became necessary to caU out a military force to put an end to the disturbance. The same scenes have been repeated. Other advices from the same place state that in consequence of the illegal conduct of the Government functionaries of Moldavia previous to the elections, the Perkelal (Prefect) of Galatz had sent his resignation to the lIaimakan on the 12th. The acts of which that functionary complains are, that the electoral lists were falsified by the erasure of several names inserted by the Prefect and the substitution of others ; that several Sub-Prefects were dismissed without cause assigned; that a system of terror prevailed throughout the district ; that the grossest illegality was practised on the revision of thc lists ; that the Sultan's firman was disregarded or violated; that the Prefect was removed and sent on a mission to Bessarabia at the moment he ought to have presided over the Commission; and that the population of eight suburbs of Galatz were deprived of their political rights. In conclusion, the Perkelal informs the Kaimakan that, measures of intimidation still preventing the electors from voting freely, he feels it his duty to resign his functions, as it is impossible to perform them under the system pursued by the Government. A telegraphic despatch announces, further, that a considerable ntumber of Moldavians of note have decided on protestingagainst the elections which took place on the 19th. This being the dead season, there is hardly any change to be noticed in the trade of Paris. The manufacturers are doing little, and the shopkeepers less. The same observations apply to the departments. IN'anufacturing operations are, moreover, impeded by the contiuned high price of cottonwool and silk. Cotton has risen 30 per cent. within the last two years, and the corresponding rise in the manufactured article is not more than from 20 to 25 per cent. The last accounts from the United States do not promise the manufacturers much relief. The production of cotton used in manufactories under the name of " middling" is far from sufficient for the consumption. Similar causes prevent an improvement at Lyons. The silk crop, though less bad than was apprehended, is inadequate to supplytthe wants of the manufacturers. High prices are consequelltly maintained, and on the other hand the stock of silk goods both in Europe and America is still sufficient for the limitel demand which exists. The principal business trans. acted in silk goods is done by speculators, who not long since purchased at Lyons a large quantity of raw and manlfactured silks without having any imnmediate demand for them. The accounts from the fair of Beaucaire are satisfactory. There were many large transactions during the first few days, but they were slightly checked subse4 luently by the very high prices demanded for almost all the articles exposed for sale. The hawkers and pedlars bought largely: they founld a ready sale among the farmers, who have plenty of money to spare, having sold their produce at exorbitant prices during some years past. Colonial produce was looking down last week. The last rise in the price of sugar has caused a reaction, and cofiee is less in demand. The fall in the price of corn and w ine lately noticed has not been maintained. It is said that the oWlium has madce rapid progress within the last eigflht days in the Bordelais, notwithstanding the liberal use of sulplhur. Flour has during the same time become snore firm, for immediate delivery, but the offers for time bargains are numerous and the terms lower. It is certain that the harvest is nearly three weeks earlier than last year, and new wheat would have been already offered for sale in several markets but that the gathering of the crops is retarded by the want of hands. The wheat harvest is nearly concluded in the south of France, and the department of the north, always the latest in France, is now occupied with a similar operation. The rye has been stacked in every arrondissement of the department, and the early wheat is being reaped. The harvest is everywhere of the finest description. Theoats, potatoes, beetroot, eventhose planted two or three times, are most flourishing. There is not much said of the potato blight, although it has appeared in some places. The last country corn markets were less abundantly supplie d than those of the preced- ing week, and prices were more firm. Nevertheless, the farmers are unanimous in declaring that for 10 years there has not been so abundant a wheat harvest. mhe produce is estimated at one-third more than last year. Notwithstanding the appearance of the oidium in the Bordelais, the sale of inferior wines is difracult. The cocmission agents at Bercy were never more abundantly supplied, and further cOnsignment s arrive by railway. The price of brandy has declined, except that of Cognac, which is still firm. Aragn ac, Saintonge, and Marmande have fallen from 12f. to 15f. the liectolitre. Spirit distilled from beetroot is quoted at 115f. and 1 11f. the hectolitre. Prince Napoleon is expected atHavreonthoth. The Emperor h b been n ineited by the aunicipajj of Manchester to visit that city during his sojourn in England.

BELGIUTL The first of the series of fees in commemoration of the marriage of the Princess Charlotte of Belgium with the Archduke Maximilian of Austria took place on Sunday, the 26th inst. The whole town of Brussels and the environs iwore a gala suiit in honour of the occasion, and the inhabitants vied with each other in the decoration of their houses. Nearly every house had its flag, with appropriate motto, and the decorations were such as Belgian artists know so well how to make. The weather, fortunately, was fine, both on the first and second days, and aU appears to have passed off to the great satisfaction of every one. The great feature in all fetes in Belgium-the contests with the longbow, the crossbow, and -the rifle, appear to have drawn the most attention, and to have excited the greatest interest. The latter weapon, although a great favourite in these modern war times, was completely beaten out of the field on Sunday. People would not stop to look at the black-looking rifle when the accessories of dress and historical fame of the former appealed so loudly to the senses and the imagination. The other great feature of the fete of Sunday was the floricultural exhibition in the park. The flowers were arranged with the best effect and the happiest art; they called forth the undisguised admiration of His Majesty the King and his ilustrious guests, who were delighted with the beauty of the arTangements that prevailed around. Elegant tents were pitched here and there in the park, and these cortained the choicest specimens of floricultural art and those which were unable to bear the ruder temperature without. At half-past 1 their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess de Brabant, the Archduke Charles Louis, and the Archduchess set out from the palace for the Exposition, accompanied by the Count and Countess de Lannoy, the Countess de Grin, and MM. d'Overchie de Neerische and Burnell, aides-de-camp. The Royal party were received by the Committee of Management of the Royal Floricultural Society, the Duke d'Ursel, President, and MM. Putzeys, Monen, Simon Brunelle, and E. Mottin, who had the,honour of offering magnificent bouquets to the two Princesses. Their Royal Highnesses compli mented the managers of theE xposition for the taste which they had displayed in the brilliant results which they had obtained. Their Royal Highnesses returned afterwards to the Palace. On Monday, the 27th inst., the marriage of Her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte took place in the Palace of Brussels. At half-past 10 a.m. carriages, containing those who had been invited to witness the religious ceremony, continued to arrive. The civil ceremony took place in a room of the Palace called the saloe Weu, and was witnessed by members of the Royal and Imperial Families only. This was the more necessary from the small size of the apartment. The guard of honour in the interior of the Palace was formed of pupils of the Military School, and Swiss, in splendid liveries, stood at every door. At 11 o'clock His Majesty the King, giving his arm to the Princess Charlotte, and accompanied by the rest, of the iUlustrious party, proceeded from their apartments to the salon blei), where everything had been arranged for the civil ceremony. His Majesty commanded his Grand Marshal,ithe Count de Marnin, to introduce the Burgornaster of the town of Brussels, M. Ch. de Brouck6re, and MAWafelaer, the secretary of the Communal Administration. M. de Brouckbre appeared in his official costume, and wore the various symbols of his office, He placed himself in the chair which had been reserved for him, and, after having performed the various formalities required by the civil law, addressed those whom he had legally united in the following terms:- " Mlonsieur and Madame.-I am deeply moved. The act which has just been accomplished presages a happy future for you both, and crowns the wishes of the King. I feel, also, that it is another day of happiness to a Qaeen who has experienced so many misfortunes. You, Monsieur, will follow in another land the career you have run with such intelligence and success. You, Madam, in bearing the wishes and regrets of Belgium to your new home, will there revive the inappreciable qualities of your mother, both showing yourselves worthy descendants of your illustrious grandmother, who has left such glorious sourenirs among us. Henceforth a new bond unltes us to Austria; your Royal Highnesses will share in the attachment we have vowed to the King, and we shall follow your footsteps with the most lively interest. " Monsieur and Madame,-I do not know how to congra. tulate myself suiliciently for having been the instrument of the law in thus expressing to you the sentiments of respect and devotion oi the capital, and, I feel assured, of the entire country." The Archduchess Charlotte (for her marriage now gives her this new title) listened with visible emotion to the address of the Burgomaster. The Archduke Maximilian and the King himself were also much moved. The civil ceremony having terminated, the august couple signed the marriage deeds, which had been prepared by M. Waefelaer, as also the King, the Queen Marie-Ame'lie, and the following august personages :-His Royal Highness Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, Prince Consort of England; the reigning Duke of Saxee-Gotha , the Archduke Charles Louis, Governor of the Tyrol; and the Archduchess Marguerite, the Duke Auguste of Saxe-Coburg and the Duchess Clementine d'Orleans, his wife; the Duke and Duchess de Brabant, the Comte de Flandre, the Prince de inange, and the following eight witnesses:-The Prince de Ligne, President of the Senate; M. Delehaye, President of the Chamber; M. Dedecker, Minister of the Interior; and M. Nothomb, Minister of Justice, for the Princess Charlotte. Eis Excellency the Coumt d' Achinto, His Excellency the Prince Clary, His Excellency the Baron de Vrients de Truenfeld, and the Count de PNry-Zichy for the Archduke. Immediately after the civil marriage the Court proceeded to the Chapel, where the religious part of the ceremony was performed. The spectacle thac here presented itself was magnificent, and the Chapel was crowded to excess with Royal and di" tinguished personages, most of them superbly dressed. RUSSIA. (FROM OUl; BEELN CO BEMO]IIT.) BERLIN, J1uLY 26. The information which the Russian papers contain as regards the time and the route of the Emperor's return is evidently incorrect. He cannot set out on his return thither on the 26th inst., since he arrived here, or rather at Potsdam, this very morning at 9 o'clock; and he will not retumr by way of Poland, since on the 30th he wil leave Stottin for St. Petersburg. Nor wiU the Grand Duke Mi. chael proceed at present to Warsaw, as the Polish papers would lead us to expect; he also goes direot to St. Petersburg, and to superintend the preparations now being made for the visit of hisfianede, who wiU arrive there with the Empress-Mother. The Princess Cecilia of Baden will, in the course of next month, be confirmed in the faith of the Greek Church, and, having previously signified her adop tion of it, and on the 28th of August or, perhaps the 1st of Septembar, her nuptials with the Grand Duke will be solemnized. The Empress-Mothee intends to spend a few days after the Emperor leavoi here at Muskau, a seat belonging to PrinceFrederick of the Netherlands. The Grand Duke Constantine is on a visit of inspection of the Baltic coasts. A fresh revision of the existing relations as regards the tenure of land on the Apanage estates of the Imperial Family has been ordered, with a view to remove everything which might seem calculated to prolong the state of serfdom among the peasants on those estates; it is intended that their position shaU be assimilated entirely to that ot the peasantry on the State domains, who are de jstre perfectly free, but de facto are stiU much cir. cumscribed in the vindication of their liberty by the ill-wiU of the local subaltern authorities. We are accustomed to think of serfdom as an institution ;pervading the whole of Russia, and as consisting of one and the7same unvaried relation of landlord and villein, but this is by no means the real state of the case. Not only is serfdom entirely abolished in the Russian Baltic provinces, but in Poland the position of a peasant who has availed himself of the exisiting provision of the law is almost that of a copyhold tenant. He is not entitled, it is true, to hold a copy of his entry on the domain roll as the title-deeds of his tenure, nor to sell his land and present the buyer at the court-leet for " admittance," but he cannot be dispossessed of his land as long as he fulfils the terms of his tenure, though he is free to give it up, quit the estate, and settle elsewhere on giving three months' notice. The rent is paid in a fixed amount of labour, called Bobot, and not in money or in kind. This appears to be tenure introduced into the state domains, and to which that now existing on the Apanage domains is to be assimilated. Where serfdom still exists in it3 unmitigated form, as in the central provinces of Russia Proper, a serf is a " pure viflein," glebme adstbictus. He cannot leave home without the permission of his owner,and the amount of the labour he shall render for his land, &c., is not specifically fixed. A custom has, however, been introduced in the course of years which tends to alleviate this state of villenage somewhat. The Russian serf may by an arrangement with his owner become the tenantat-will of his own self, or in other words obtain the usufruct of his own time and faculties on the payment of a fixed rent, agreed upon with his owner; this is called Obrok. Thus it comns that serfs quit! their- homes and settle in towns, where they exercise their tale nts and industry; the rent they have to pay for themselves may, however, accordinglto their success, be raised from time to time by their owner, whose property they remain. Hundreds of the tradespeople making good incomes in St. Petersburg and Moscow are serfs, and pay about 5,000 silver roubles rent for themselves, while merchants in that position frequently have to pay to the extent of from 10,000 to 20,000 silver roubles. The Princes Sheremeteff, Demidoff, and others are possessed of serfs who are themselves millionmaircs; it will, therefore, not be surprising that, when any talk is made of emancipation against an indemnity, the figures should be put rather high-such as thousands, and sometimes a million of roubles. These circumstances make anlemancipation of the Russian serfs, which, since the commencement of this reign, has been the object of the Emperor's most assiduous endeavours, totally beyond the reach of any imaginable amount of money, if such a mea sure were to be proposed for execution by the Government. The emancipation of the serfs by a money indemnity must therefore be left to such individual serfs as are possessed of pecuniary means; even if the consent of the noble proprietors of "souls' could be obtained. W/hile the opposition on the part of the nobles in Russia Proper to this commutation or capitalization of the rents they derive from their serfs on O6rok is as great as it is, no Emperor of Russia in his senses will venture on attempting to enforce it, since such an at tempt could end only in rebellion or revo. lution. The course that is left to the Government seems to be that of introducing into Russia the same relation as exists in Poland, where the owner is bound on the application of the serf to a local board to admit him to a tenancy of land at a rent to be agreed upon between them, under the superintendence and intervention of the board, and make further arrangements for his eventual emancipation, The idea that has also somle advocates in Russia of introducing the plan adopted in Prussia at the beginning of this century-viz., that of converting the Socagers into absolute proprietors of the land on the payment of a moderate quit-rent, does not seem likely to prevail there ; it was a grand agrarian revolution, even in Prussia, where the peasants were not quite serfs, but tenants in perpetuity; and could only have been carried out there in a time of great national adversity, when hope and enthusiasm gladly looked to the measure as the first step towards national regeneration. PRUSSIA. A telegraphic despatch from Berlin, dated July 26, says:- The Queen of Greece is expected here the day after to. morrow. " The Prussian Government, in reply to questions put on the subject, has officially declared its fun approval of tho conduct of the Prussian Commissioner in the Danubian Principalities. "The Governments of the Zollverein demand collectively from England, through the medium of Prussia, an indemnification for the losses incurred by their fellow-sub. Jects at Canton, the bombardment having taken place without a notification having been made to the Consuls." ITALY. In reply to certain strictures addressed to Piedmont by the official press of Lombardy, the Opitione of Turin of the 25th says:- "Far from being exposed to the calamities of insurrec. tion, Sardinia is of all countries that which has known best how to avert them. Austria is mistaken when she says that during the late disturbances her Italian provinces have not suffered froma Mazzini's attaeks. It used to be said that.the ashes from the pipe of a French corporal would create in Italy a conflagration fatal to Austria. We wiU not say the same of the pipe of a Piedmontese corporal, but it is certain that the report of Sardinian cannon in Italy would have quite a different effect from th!tt of Mazzinian conspiracies; for it would be a signal in which the people would have confidence, because they would be convinced that if such an enterprise were commenced it would be with sufficient means, and that its object would be in hannony with the wishes of the nation; while Mazzini, although Austria thinks him more logical in his endeavours, has neither means cqual to the resistance he will meet with nor an ob. ject sanctioned by public opinion." The Lis, the Catholic journal of Florence, announces that the Pope was to arrive on the 21st at Ravenna, whence he would retmrn to Bologna, where he will hold, on the 3d of Augulst, the con sistory already spoken of. It is in the course of the second fortnight of next month that his Holiness will visit the Grand Duke of Tuscany at Florence. ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES. (FROe OuR OWN CORRESPIODMfT.) Wind N.W.

I FESTIVAL AT THE ROYAL SUBREY GARDEN& The grand military festivalfor the benefit of Ms. Seacole, which had been so long announced and eagerly anticipated by a large part of the public, took place last night in the music-hall of the Royal Surrey Gardens, under the direction of M. Jullien. Nothing could have been more triumphantly sucoessful. The entertainment had evidently been organized con ano-re by the directors, and the talent and indomitable energy of M. Julien, as usual, surmounted all obstacles. Notwithstanding that the charge for admlssion was quintupled, there was an immense concourse in the hail, and it need scarcely be said the audience was of a character more " exdusive" than is customary at transpontine musical performances. The hailwastastefully decorated with English, French, Sardinian, and Turkish flags, a magnificent transparenoy being conspicuous above the orchestra. Mr. Seacole sat in state in front of the centre gallery, supported by Lord Rokeby on one side, byLord George Paget onthe other, and surrounded by the members of her committee. Few names were more familiar to the public during the late war than that of Mrs. Seacole. A Creole by birth and a sutler by profession, she set out for the Crimea soon after the landing of the British troops. At considerable cost she erected the British Hotel, and established a restaurant for officers and soldiers. Here the medical knowledge she had acquired in the West Indies proved of eminent service. Her hut was daily besieged by the Army Works and Land Transport men, for whom she would prescribe in cases of diarrhcea, dysentery, and other camp maladies. Not satisfied with this, she suppliedthemand,indeed,all who required her aid-with creature comforts from her store, in most cases without payment or any hope of it. Mrs. Seacole, in short, was the first to give a now character to the trade of sutler, and rescue it from the im. putation of worthlessness and plunder. This estimable person was ruined by the peace which others welcomed with such enthusiasm, having laid in a large stock of stores, purchased at high prices, most of which, at the termination of the war could neitber be sold nor removed. It is hoped that the proceeds of this festival, projected by a society of patrons with the Commander-im-Chief at the head, will enable her to recommence her career of usefulness and actiity. In the Crimea she nursed the sick, succoured the wounded, and performed the last offices to mauy of the most illustrious dead. Mrs. Seacole is not inclined to lead an idle life, and if the exertions now making in her behalf prove successful it is, we un derstand, her in. tention to start at once for India, where she will be enabled to resume those self-imposed duties which earned for her at the recent seat of war the title of "mother" of our soldiers. The concert itself was one of great and varied attractions, the performances of the united military bands forming, as it was natural to expect under the circumstances, the chief points of interest. The gigantic combination of martial music was composed of the bands of the 1st and 2d Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards Blue, the Grenadier Guards, the Coldstreams, Scots Fusileers, Royal Engineers, Royal ArtUlery, and Marines-nine in all. Tbese, added to the justly renowned orchestra of 1i JuUien, and the chorus of the Royal Surrey Choral Society, constituted a vocal and instrumental force of little short of 1,000 performers. The effect of the national anthem with which the concert began, may be well imagined; never was the strong sentiment of loyalty, which is a distinctive and happy characteristic of the British people, expressed through the medium of sound with more overpowering grandeur. The audience were "electrified "-and no wonder. In the British Arszy and the English quadrilles-two of xi. Jullien's most famous compositions of the class termed "descriptive"-the strength and efficiency of the united bands formed the theme of unqualified admiration, and their precision was equaUy a matter of surprise. Never were the indications of the conductor's stick-so long trained and experienced in the art of directing vast masses-followed with greater quickness and unanimity. Not a pamsage wavered, not a hitch occurred, and the delicacy with which the solo variations were accompanied were just as remarkable as the effect of the united phalanx of instrumentalists in the louder passages was prodigious and astounding. The last figure of the Bnglish Quadritle was encored with acclamaions. " Rule Britannia," " Partant pour la Syrie," and the national anthem-in which the chorus added their voices to the harnloomous thunder of the bands-brought the concert to a termination with congenial spirit, and excited enthusiasm without bounds. But Al. Jullien had provided other treats for the patrons of Mrs. Seacole. A selection from Mozart's Don Giovanni, consistig of some of the most popular airs and duets, contributed by those excellent artists hi and Madame Gassier, and concluding with a part of the first finale; the Hibc-nian Quadrille of A. Jullien; the two last moveinents from Beethoven's C minor symphony; Purcell's " Come if you dare," magnificently declaimed by Mr. Sims Reeves, and encored; the finales to Mendelsohn's Loreley, the solo part by Madame Rudersdorff; and "Ah non giunge," by Madame Gassier, were also included in the first part of the concert. In the interval the " Hallelujah" from Handels Alessiah was given by the chorus; and, besides what has been meentioned, the second part includedthe well-known fantasia on the Huquenots; a very graceful ballad by Mr. Frank Mlori, " Who shall be fairest ?" for which Mr. Sims Reeves obtained another encore; the trio and chorus " The Heavens are telling" (Creation), and other pieces. The whole passed off with unflagging Spirit, and was thoroughly enjoyed by the audience, who indulged nevertheless, somewhat too frequently in the encore system which protracted the duration of the concert to an unusuaUy late hour, and must have fairly tired out both conductor and performers. At the end of both the first and the second parts the name of MIrs. Seacole was shouted by a thousand voices. The genial old lady rose from her place and smiled benignantly on the assembled multitude, amid a tremendous and continued cheering. Never did woman seem happier, and never was hearty and kindly greeting bestowed upon a worthier object. This evening the concert, with the whole of the military bands, will be repeated, at 2s. 6d. entrance. On Wednesday and Thursday. tbe last days of the festival, the public vill be admitted at the ordinary prices.
ADELPHI ATBE. Affer an absence of severalfweeks, during which Mr. and Mrn. Barney Villiams constituted the sole attraotion of the Adelphi Theatre, the regular force, comnrising Mr. B. Webster, Madame Celeete, Mr. Wright, and Mr. Pani Bed ford, re-appeared last night, and were heartily welcomed by the audience. The new drama, George Darville, which had been checked by the migration of the company in the midst of a successful " rnn," resumed its place in the bills, and two of the most recent farces concluded the evening's entertainment. Such a change of performance may be considered almost equivalent to the commencement of a new season.
A IOVBY-MARK1TandJITYIBTELLIGENCli, Monday ETening. No news from India having arrived up to the ternination of business this evening the funds have remained without variation. Consols opened at 91i to i for money and 914 to : for the 6th of August, and manifested great steadiness to the official close. After regular hours, however, there was some heaviness, owing to the receipt of lower prices from Paris. Bank Stock left off at 215 to 216; Reduced, 915 to 4; New Three per Cents., 914 to 4; India Stock, 214 to 217; India-bonds, 25s. to 15s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 984 to 4; and Exchequer-hills, 6s. to 2s. discount. Foreign securities have again been dull through out the day, few transactions taking place, except in Turkish, which closed at a decline. Other stocks wege firm, in some cases at an advance. Russian Five per Cents. were negotiated at .11; Mexican, for the account, 224; Portuguese, for the account, 45i; Spanish, 404); the Certificates, 54; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 944, 944, and 944; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 102-1.; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97i; and Dutch Four per Cents., 98i and 984. The corn-market this morning was firm at the prices of Monday last. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 66f. 70c. for both money and account, showing a fall of nearly a quarter per cent. 'Ip to this evening the India mall can scarcely be said to be overdue. Last year the accounts by the corresponding mail did not reach Trieste till the afternoon of the 28th of July, and it is the same steamer (the Bengal) that will now have performed the passage from India to Suez. Consequently the only reasons for expecting an earlier arrival on this occasion consist in the assumption that every effort would be made for increased speed, and that a steamer with Government messages would at once be sent from Alexandria to the telegraph at Cagliari, so as to anticipate by several hours anything that could come by other routes. The continental exchanges continue with a rather unfavourable appearance. At Hamburg discount remains at 64 per cent. In Belgium money is dearer, and an increase in the rate is expected. A furthe- -um of about 43,0001. in bar gold was withdrawn xaom the Bank to-day for exportation to the continent. The amount of silver to be sent to India and China by the Ripon on the 4th of August is estimated at about 600,0001. or 700,0001. The suspension was announced to-day of the house of Mr. J. P. Giustiniani, a Greek merchant, with engagements estimated at from 250,0001. to 300,0001. His business was principally with Constantinople and Paris, and he wvas largely engaged during the Russian war in supplying steam-vessels to the Turkish Government. These operations were understood to have been profitable, but latterly speculativelosses are believed to have been sustained, and for some time past there has been a disposition in many quarters to a withdrawal of confidence. In the course of the afternoon statements were circulated that the existing difficulties would be removed before the end of the day, but these were not fulfilled. The specie from America to-day is only 61,0001., the whole of which will be sent to the Continent. The Columbia, on Thursday, will probably bring a further amount, and, although the remittances are now small-as compared with those received a few weeks back, it is not expected there will be any cessation of shipments throughout the remainder of the year. The advices on the present occasion describe no material alteration in the stock-market. Erie Railway shares were quoted 28 to i; Reading, 774 to*~; NewvYork Central, 80-4; Panama, 874;* and Illhnois Central, 118 to 120. The recent improvement in the weather had acted wonderfully upon the growing crops, and wheat and barley would be abundant. With regard to Indian corn there was still some uncertainty. The advices from Mexico to-day vi America are to the 3d of July. They confirm the statement that more than 450,0001. in silver may be expected by the Parana on Saturday next, which vessel, it appears, will also bring at least 100,0001. in Californisn gold. The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week are wholly uninteresting. At Manchester, pending the arrival of the mail, the business for India has been nearly suspended; otherwise there has been a fair demand. The Birmingham iron-market has been well maintained, while for the general manufactures of that town the home and export prospects are encouraging. At Nottingham the transactions in lace have been satisfactory. In the woollen districts the tone continues firm, and in the Irish linen-markets prices are steady. The prospectus has been issued of the Westminster Palace Hotel Company, with a capital of 100,0001. in 101. shares. The site is a plot of ground close to the Abbey in Victoria-street, and the promoters point to the advantages to be derived from its proximity to the Houses of Parliament and the courts of law. The building is to comprise 200 sleeping rooms. At a meeting to-day of the Western Bank of London, Mr Roebuck, M.P., in the chair, the report and accounts were adopted, and a dividend was declared at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum. The chairman congratulated the proprietors on the progress of the bank, although it wras formed at a peried of great trial to the class of persons lik;ely to become shareholders in such undertaklngs. He observed that great difficulties have been met, and a severe crisis gone through; but, notwithstanding these disadvantages, they have in their first year reached a point which the London and Westminster in the corresponding period of its existence did not attain. The capital is applied solely to the legitimate purposes of bankng, discounting bills and loans on security for short periods. The relative proportions of the capital and liabilities are such as to give perfect safety to depositors. Some discussion took place with reference to the appropriation of the profits, and two amendments were moved, the one setting aside 1,0001. for the directors' remuneration, and the other increasing the reserve fund and writing off a smaller sum for preliminary expenses, but they were both rejected. 501. was voted as remuneration for the auditors, when Mr. Jay observed that the audit had been real and complete, the cash, bills, notes, and securities having been carefully examined. Annexed is an abstract of the report and accounts:- "The directors have the pleasure of laying before the proprietors the results of the operations of the bank during the first year of its existence. By the annexed statement it will be seen that after payment of interest to customers on their current and depoEit accounts, amounting to 3,7511., discharging al current expenses, and writing off al bad debts, and al bills overdue, there remains a disposable balance of 7,7431. net profit, which the directors appropriate in the following manner, viz. :-In payment of a dividend at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum on the paid-up capital, for past half-year, 3.0001.; in reduction of preliminary expenses, 1,3331.; placing to a reserve fund, 2,2431; carrying to profit and loss new account for rebate on bills not due, 1,1661. By the above appropriation the directors desire to indicate their wish not to receive any remuneration at present for their past services. They beg to assure the proprietors that, notwithstanding the many obstacles which have beset the bank at its commencement, the basiness is very steadily and satisfactorily increasing, and they feel the most entire confidence that by a pradent and unflinching adherence to the legitimate principles of banking thty shall ultimately obtain for it a position among the nost prosperous joint-stock banks of the metropolis.

THE COBN TRADE. KARR.LANE, MOwDAY A00z oo;. JULY 27. The usrivals last week were generally good, but principally foreign. The exports were trifling, viz :-6 quarters wheat, 60 quarters malt, 8 quarters oats, and 18 sacks four. Of English wheat the receipts were 4,289 quarters; the foreign, principally from Dantsiao and Stettin, 26,449 quar. ters. The morning's supply from Kent and Essex was small, and business slow; but the7previous Monday's nominal rate, were fully realized, with more tone in foreign parcels, many of which were withdrawn. There were 9,528 sacks flour received from the country, I with 1,367 barrels 430 sacks foreign. Norfolks retained the price of the previous Monday, being held at 40. Axmerican, withlittle offering, was very dull, town samples retaining former value. Of English barley there were 456 quarters, of fore2ga 12,721 quarters. The new samples of Rentish were not readily placed. Pore2gn fit for malting and distillation being in sanill compass about kept its price, but grinding sorts were fully ls. lower, and hard to quit. llt found but a limited inquiry, at former rates. The supply of oats was large, vlz, :-49,759 quarters. Of these 104 quarters were English, 808 quarters Scotch, 910 Irish, and 47,947 quarters foreign. Thebulk of theselatter being in bad condition made a very heavy market, and such parcels sold irregularly, being fully is. per quarter lower. Sweet corn was also influenced downwards to the extent of 6d. per quarter. Of beans there were 792 quarters English and 584 quar. toe foreign; of peas 231 quarters native and 1,833 quar. ters white from the Baltic. New samples of dun peas were lower,lbut boilers retained their value. Beans remained unaltered. Of linseed there were 5,853 quarters from India, the export being 820 quarters. The trade was unchanged in crushing seeds, there being a good inquiry for cakes. In the seed trade generally little was passing. lNew rape. seed slowly realized 36M. for seed. Cloierseed and trefoil retained their value. The new winter tares were small, but dry; prices scarcely Eettled. Canary slowsale. Caraway, coriander, and other seeds unchanged.

ELECTION COMMITTlEES. The General Committee of Eleotions yesterday nominated the following committees:- DovXR.-The Hon. Hugh Annesley, Mr. Kinnalrd, Mr. Langton, Mr. Christy; chairman, Mr. J. A. Smith. * DnoGHnA.-Lord R. Clinton, Sir M. Farquhar, Mr. Aarjoribanks, Mr. Rust; chairman, Mr. J. Estcourt. IPSWICH. This committee reassembledi at 11 o'clock yesterday morning. George Jarrit, landlord of the Friar's Head, where committee-rooms had been engaged for Adair and Marabman, having been examined with regard to the persons who frequented those committee-rooms during the election, Mr. CooKE said he would now close the case in support oh. B J s then called the following evidence for the sitting members:- Mr. Long, a solicitor, who had been In practice atlpswich for the last 20 years, said he was a supporter of the Liberal party, and had acted for Mr. Adair since that gentleman commenced his connexion with the borough. The business of the election on the Liberal aide was conducted by him in conjunction with Mr. Head, the agent of Mr. Marshman. Mr. Lawrance had also been appointed an agent, but he only acted occasionally. At the tme of the dissolution MIr. Adair was on the continent, but arrived in the borough before the election took place. No committee was appointed by the Liberal party, but district rooms were engaged, where consultations could be held and information given with regard to the business of the election. There was no time to organize a regular canvass. He remembered Hughes coming to him at the central committee-room and claiming some money for the travelling expenses of himself and his sons from London. He climed something over 2L, and witness paid him the amount when he ad nade a calculation and ascertained that it was fairly due to him. He did not, however, use the expresson, "Now we have made it all right." Previous to the election a strong impression prevailed in the borough that there was an understanding of some kind between dr. Adair and Mr. Cobbold, andlas that impression, which was, he believed, countenanced by the other aide, was calculated to injure the interests of Mr. Adair, handbills were circulated for the purpose of contradicting the rumour. It was a matter of remark in the borough that a number of voters went to the poll after 1 o'clock. To the best of his knowledge no improper practices whatever had been resorted to during the election. He had adhered strictly to the instructions of Mr. Adair not to have recourse to any such practices. All the money which had been expended had been returned by the election auditor. He de. nied thatihe had bribed any one, or given any promise to induce an elector to vote. On croas-examination the witness said he had only pd Hughes and his sons the sum to which he thought they were entitled. A great number of teetotalers frequented the committee-rooms of Messrs. Adair and Marshman, and a large body of them went to the poll together. Some hundreds of votes were poUed after 1 o'cock. Mr. Jeremiah Head was next examined.-He said he mas the agent for the election expenses of Mr. Adair and Mr. Marelsman. He had received 2501. on account of those expenses from each of those gentlemen, which he paid into the bank. On the morning of the polling-day he went to the bank and drew out 501., and in the afternoon he sent young Cowell to the bank with an order for 501. The money was brought back to himnin gold at the committeeroom. The bag was handed to him in toe presence of a number of people. He sent for the money in order to pay the expenses of the out-voters, and the allowances to the clerks aDd messengers. He paid 361. odd for travelling expenses of voters. At the close of the poll about 511. remained out of the two sums he had drawn, which he took home. He paid [no money for any purpose other than thoso he had mentioned. OnIthe Monday after the election he paid the clerks and messengers, and drew other sums from the bank for that purpose, in addition to what he had taken home after3 the polling. He also paid tradesmen's bils to the amount of 1171. odd. ARl those payments appeared in the election accounts. He believed that no corrupt practices had been resorted to during the election. Cross-examined.-He thought the heavier payment; on the day of the election were made after 12 o'clock. He did not recollect seeing young Muley in the committee-room on that day. Mr. Adair, the sitting member, was then examined by Mr. E. JTAFS. He said he had represented the borough for 10 years. At thetime of the dissolution he was in Rome, and he did not arrive at Ipswich untilthe20th of March. No committee was appointed, and the election was con- ducted on his behalf by Mr. Long. During the greater' part of the polling he remained at the room which had been caUed the central committee-room, in Qaeen-street. He did not go to the Post Chaise Ian on that day. He did not wear a white hat at the time of the election. Neither Mulley, nor Bedford, nor J. Smith, the tailor, was his agent, nor were they authorized to act for him in any way. He was not alarmed as to the safety of his seat. There was an Impression in the borough that he had formed a coalition with Mr. Cobbold. He denied the rumour, and then the Liberal party did everything in their power to secure his return. That was the cause of the inilux of voters about 1 o'clock. He had sanctioped no payment for any improper purpose whatever during the election. On being cross-examinedby Mr. CoouE, Mr. Adair denied that he had been in the habit of walking about with Mr. Mulley, aud of canvassing with J. Smith, outside the house in Queen-street. There were placards,on which were written Adairs and Marshman's Committee-room." B the CommrrrzE.-At no time during the polling did he t=ink that matters were assuming a serious aspect as regarded his return. His position was a good one throughout the day. After 2 o'clock he poUed more than 40 split votes. He had not paid any money on account of the election that did not appear In the auditor's accounts. This being the close of the case for the sitting member, Mr. B. JAS addressed the committee, submitting that the election had bern conducted on the part of Mr. Adair with strict propriety, and that if some indiscreet partisans had been guilty of a few paltry acts of corruption Mr. Adair ought not to be held responsible for them. A more wretched case than that of the petitioners never had been laid before an election committee. It had been got up with the assistance of a tickea-of-leave man, and was principaly supported by evidence quite unworthy of credit, The learned counsel then went through the evidence, and concluded by submnitting that there was no ground whatever for nullifving the return. Mr. CooEr replied upon the whole case. The committee deliberated until 4 o'clock, and the chairman then announced that they would adiourn until 11 o'clock this day, when they would give their decision. They would then immediately proceed with the other petition. YARMOUTH. The Committee met again at 11 o'clock yesterday, and further evidence was given in support of the petition. George Meed, avoter, was examined, but nothing material was elicited from him except that a few weeks before the election a surgeon named Palmer had lent him 101. He voted for Mr. M'Cullagh and Mr. Watkin. He denied that he had promised his vote to Sir E. Lacon. On cross-examinationhe said that his vote was not referredto either when he applied for the loan or when Ir. Palmer lent him the money. A part of the debt was taken out by Vr. Palmer in confectionery, and he owed the remaindter. Samuel Bracey, a mariner, stated that at the time of the clection he was at Bristol. HE went to Yarmouth, of which borough he was an elector, and voted for the Liberals. At the previous election he had voted the other way, but the Conservatives on that occasion refused to pay any remuneration to his men for the loss they had incurred in consequence of his having kept his ship back in order to vote. That 'wasone reason why he voted for the Liberals. Another reason was that he felt as a sailor about the Chinese question. He had been paid 61. for his expenses. On cross-exaiination he said he reckoned that he had lost about 501. by going to Yarmouth to vote. He saw no one, and went nowhere upon his arrival at Yarmouth before he voted. J. R. Emms, a baker, said he had been canvassed by the sitting member, accompanied by Mr. Chapman and other gentlemen, previous totheelection. He told them hewould vote for them if they would get him a situation. They said they could not. They then went away, but Mr. Chapman remained behind. Mr. Chapman said that if he voted for Mr. Watkin that gentleman would very likely be able to get him a situation. About a week before the election he met Mr. Chapman, who gave him 6s. Spilling had also given him something to drink. Spilling had asked him whether 5Z. or 1O0. would be of any use to him. He said he would not take money, as he wanted a situation. No direct promise h d been made to him, but he certainly expeoted that he should have had a situation given him for voting. Cross-examined.-If the other side had offered more he should have voted for them. He was a married man, with a famy, and was in great distress at the time of the election. te had receIved 21. since making his statement. Mr. Gyton, areporter oftheFreePres= at Yarmouth, stated that during the electior he attended varous meetings of the supporters of Mr.Watkin and Mr. M'Cullagh. At thosemeetiugs he saw several of the persons who were understood to be agents of the sitting members. Among others he saw Eoyal, Robinson, Iainirice, Livingstone, and Chapman. He had seen the sitting members canvassing together, . gtone, George Farrow, Robins and other - In cross-exanination he stated that he had been a warm partisan of the Liberal cause, but they had recently gone too far forhim. He had been informed since he had been summonedas awitness that hewas dismissedfrom the paper. He would swear thathe had not been dismissedin consequence of hishaving failed to account forcertain8sums of moneywhich he had received from advertisers. Up to within the last six weeks the aper was entirely under his management, He received all the money for advertisements and for the general business of the paper. His wages were not paid more than once a month or six week; consequently he made memorandaof the sums paid him andthe money he received. paid the money into the bank, and endorsed on the back of the receipt the sums that he had deducted, aud handed it to the treasurer. The treasurer had complained that his accounts were unsatisfactory. There was an account of a man named Dyball due to the paper, and the person in question asked whether it could not be placed against an account which witness owed him. He allowed it to be so placed and accounted for it. There had been two or three other cases in which slight mistakes had been made, but the mistakes were not at all in his favour. There was a balance owing to him from the company owning the paper. His impressioncertainl was that he was discharged in consequence of his latten ing to give evidence before the committee, and not because his accounts were unsatisfactory. Re-examined by Mr. JonNsToNg-Mr. Livingstone was the treasurer of the paper; he had been connected with it 18 months, and the coUrse of proceeding since he had been in their service was to receive the money for the advertise. ments, and to balance his accounts from time to time, when sometimes there would be a balance for, and at other times MIr. llice, a mayor's officer at Yarmouth, deposed that the practice at the elections for that borough was for each side to employ stavesmen, who were appointed by the I partesandworn inby the mayor. Their duty was to keep order during the election. Mr. Spilling brought him the list on the part of the sitting members. Other men wreo afterwards added. (The list was produced.) Mr. Spilling supplied a portion of the staves. The witness wss then examined as to the hiring of the Corn-Exchange for the sitting members, and also spoke to the persons who addressed the meeting held there. Mr. Royal, the Chartist tailor, spoke there on the 26th of March, the day before the nomination. Cross-examined by Mr. JTAzs.-His duty was to serve summonses and warrants, and to carry the sword before the Mayor on state occasons. Spilling was acarpenter, bat witness did not know that he made the staves. Spilling did not tell him that he brought them from Mr. Costerton's office. He was aware now, since he had seen it, that the list was in the handwrlting of Xr. Costerton's clerk. He had delivered up the staves after the election to Mr. SpiUing, but no person had applied for those farnished by the other side. William Baldwin, a non-elector, stated that on the morn. Ing of the day of polling he went to a committee-room at the house ofa person named Goodrick, and he was ordered by Eageton to go there and assist. Whea he got there he foundBrandt and SDilng, and was told to mark off the names of the voters as they voted. He accordingly did so and remadned there all day. Erom time to time the stte of the poll was put out. The poll clerks got their instructions from Mr. Spilling. That gentleman was backwards and forwards inthe room during thewhole of the day. He was paid 11. for his services. He had made a further cladm of 6s. for a dinner, but It was not alowed. Cross-ersuiined.-It was always customary to give the check clerks a dinner: but he was too late, and as he understood that 6s. was allowed he charged it, not, however, be. case e thought he could eat 6s. worth. (Laughter.) After hearing some further evidenco of a simila nature from other persons who had been engaged in the election, The committee adjourned until this day. GLOCESTER (CI1Y). At the sitting of the committee yesterday some witnesses were called upon the question of the agency of Mr. Cooksey and Mr. Colingburn. It was stated that Mr. Cooksey had canvasedA with Mr. Price, ad that they had both been seen inthat crntlemn'scommittee-rooms. rhatrtlm then summed up the case on behalf of the petitioner, contending that al the cases of bribery vhich ad been orought before the commnittee had been satisfac. xtrllz proved, except that of the horsedealer Jenkins, which be withdrew. Theocase of Drinkwater was, he submitted, clearly one of the payment of money in order corznptly to influence a voter. At the conclusion of the learned counsers address Mr. PsRrqN called Mr. W. P. Priee, the sitting member.-Ee said he had large commnercial interests in the city of Glocester, and had represented it sincoe 1852. He had known Mr. Collngburn since he was a child, but only saw him once during the election, when he canvassedhim. He might then have walked a few yards with him, but they wero not together at any other time dvring the election. Mr. Collingbnrn did not, he believed, vote for him, and had nothing to do with him. He had no committeeroom, and no committee was appointed, butthe messengers sometimes called themselves a committee. His sole agent was Mr. Viner Ellis. He bad rooms first ati Bell-lane, nd afterwards at the Shire-hall, merely for tlo purpose of giving information. He never saw MIr. Cookoey unti within a few days of the election. About A week before the election he was introduced to Mr. Cooksey in the street, and asked him for his vote. Mr. CookseyA said he knew nothing abont the local politics, but that he Was a Liberal, andhe should like to vote for the Lbera candidates. Mr. Cooksey never canvassed with bim or was at his committee-room until the day of the polhlng, On the afternoon of the poling dsy he met Mr. Cooksey at the bootb, when Air. Cooksey told him there Was an old manin his garden who would vote for him (Mr. _rice) if he would call and see him. He accordingly got into a cab with Mr. Cooksey, who took him to see a voter namedl Mills. He asked Mills for his vote. MIIs said he had promised it to Sir R. Carden, and therefore he did not urge him any frther. Seeing the feeble state of Mills at the time, he observedto Mr. Cookseythat theyhadbetter leave himlone. He did not speak to Mr. Cooksey again that day and he had never spoken to him since. Daring the electhon the room which had been called his committee. room was very much crowded,- so much so, indeed, that he was freqently unable to get in. He was more anxions to Eecure thoreturn of Admiral Berkeley than his own, and he solicited all the voters whom he thought likely to plump for him to split for the Aidmiral. Both he and Admiral Berkeley left it entirely to the party to decide which of them should be retured. Bis feeling was that the Admiral should be preferred, as he was their old representative and had served them well. He handed Mr. V. Ellis a check for 3001. to defray the legal exPenses of the election, and he gave strict injunctions that the Act should be obeyed; indeed, he declaed that if a petition should be presented against his return ho would not defend it. On the last day for presenting petitions he met Mr. Lovegrove inthe lobby of the House, and Mr. Lovegrove told him he had been obliged to present a petition against him because one had been presented against Sir R. Carden, but he had presented it with great rductance. He replied that any charges which were broueght against either of them ought to be investigated, adding at this was not the first time he had been petitioned against withont a cause. A petition had been presented against him in 1852. On being cross-examined Mr. Price said he was sincerely anxious at the election for the success of Admiral Berkeley, but he did not withdraw from the contest on account of his engagement to the party. The understanding ws that the party shouldchoose which candidate they pleased. He beleved that Admiral Berkeley was also more anzious for his (witness')successthanforhisown. (Laughter.) Mr. W. Viner Ellis was then called and examined with respect to the conversation between himself and Bullock, the fishmonger. He stated that Bullock told him he had promised one vote to Sir R. Carden, upon which he had asked him to give his other voteto Mr. Price. He denied having said "lfyou vote for Price you shall never want for fish," or anything to that effect. He had neither made nor was responsible for any payments beyond those which appeared i the auditor's accounts. This being the close of the case in support of the return, Mr. PU& summed up, submitting that the petition had only been presented with theviewof effecting a compromise, and in consequence of a petition having been presented against Sir B. Carden, and that the petitioners' case had been supported only by the most trivial evidence. Mr. LDE, for the petitioners, then replied upon the whole case, contending that the allegations in the petition had been clearly established. The committee deliberated until 4 o'clock. The CAR&sAN then announced that they had agreed to aresolution that Mr. Price was dulyelected, but they would not draw up the terms of their resolution until their meeting at 11 'clock to-morrow (this day). HUNT GDON (COUNTY). On the reassembling of the committee yesterday morn. ingthecaseof a voternamed Ward, towhoma breakfast had been given on the morning of the election,was resumed, and Mr. Perceval, the agent of Mr. Fellowes, who had lnvited voters to attend it, was examined at considerable tr. O'MALLuY then addressed the committee, contending that in no case had avote been avoided by the fact that the voter had roceived meat, drink, and entertainment, except such meat, drink, and entertainment had been given and received corruptly. Mr. RODWELL was heard on the other side. The ComonTM decided that the vote in question should notbe struck out of the list of Mr. Fellowes. The committee then adjourned.
A SHOWEB. oF HERRI1tGS.-A Brora correspondent informs us that considerable sensation has been created in that neighbourhood by there being found a large quantity of herrings, on a recent morning, lying scattered in one of the Dalibalm gardens, whioh is nearly half a mile from the shore. When cooked the herriegs were found quite good and fresh; and it is regarded, from numerous substantial reasons, as imposdble that they could have been eawried by any individuals, and thus scattered by them over the garden. They filled an average aized basket. Many conjectares are afloat as to the cause of this singular phenomenon, ; but the most likely is that it has been oceasioned by a waterspout, several instances of a like character having occurred In the north since the commencement of the present eontury. The superstitious have made the most of this occurrence, and some are found to be in A state of indignation against the persons who dared to cat fish found under such equivocal circumstances. But we are glad to add that no judgment has yet overtaken them for such a daring act of impiety,-NVorUtc,-n (WZickJ Ensig7n.

TIHE UNITED STATBS. (ROB OUR NEW YORK CORRESroNRS=N.) NEW YORK, JULY 14. e have at Last had a vweek of sDmmer weather, with the thermometer ranging abott 9(0 Fahrenheit, and the people revelling in white dftck and sherrycobblers. This has advanced the northern whseMt crops, which the late rains were beginning to threaten. From all parts we hear that an unusual ,quantity of ground is in geed-in some parts of ths 'Westera States 25 per cent. more than ever before, Unleas some extraordinary event, now unforeseen, shall happen, we may look for one of the largest harvests that this country has ever produced. The hot weather has also brought to New York the first case of yellow fever for the season. A seaman taken from an infeoted vessel at quarantine died at the hospital of that disease. With the fresh recollection of last year, when a rigidquarantine saved us from the pestilence, which more than decimated Norfolk the year before, we may look for the next three month3 to see the same or a greater rigour enforced. The news from the Southern ports, however, does not indicate that this is to be a yellow fever year. There is not much of it at the Havannah, and none, I believe, at New Orleans. Neither has it yet made its appearance at Charleston, Savannah or Norfolk. Notwithstandingthis it is understood thatthe quarantinelaws will be stringently enforced. It is the better opinion among medical men that the health of New York was saved last year by the course pursued by the health officers, so that public opinion will uphold them this year in the. same course, however small may be. the real danger. The neighbours of the new quarantine station rebel at having -the infection put off on them. The place has been preserved for the last two months against organized attacks only by the presence of a strong police force. Even this 'did not avail on Sunday last. The oystermen made an attack upon the proposed hospital in three separate bodies, and caught the police napping. Skots were interchanged-with revolvers by the police and muskets by the assailants, and the latter were driven back, some of them fatally wounded. The sheriff of the county confesses his inability to preserve the peace, and the military are ordered out. Simultaneously with this outbreak the Germans in New York got up another riot-not quite as destructive as the "dead rabbit" Irish 'ow of the 4th, but otherwise quite a respectable rebellion, even for these riotous times. New York is divided into quarters as marked from each other as the different quarters of any city of the middle ages, or as the Jewish part of Amsterdam from the rest of that town. Avenues A and B are German. The signs, the cabbages, the lager-beer saloons, the dirt, and the odours bear unmistakeable testimony as to the nationality of the people. They are all Democrats, too, with not vory definite ideas as to the force of law in this Democratic land. Among other doubtful laws passed at Albany last winter was one regulating the sale of liquors, and authorizing the police to close lager-beer and other drinking shops on Sundays. Our German friends are not very strict observers of the Sabbath, and when the police came to enforce the law they resisted. A fight ensued, which was kept up at intervals throughout the day, and was renewed yesterday in a serious way. The Germans drove the police out, and took complete possession of their own part of the town. They armed themselves with revolvers. The " Black Republicans," they said, should be put down, and the lager-beer saloons shouldbe open. A body of police marching through the district about 9 o'clock was fired upon, but made their way without serious injury. The mob not retiring, however, the military were again called out, and before morning the city was quiet. The outbreaks of the past month indicate a feverish feeling in the people, which is undoubtedly played upon by others who wish to use it for their own purposes. The metropolitan police are resisted at every slep. and it is apparent that their authority can be established only by force. In all the conflicts up to this time they have not been strong enough to suppress the rioters. They have invariably had to fail back upon the military and the Mini6 rifle. It is plain that the law bas not the support of the metropolis; if there were any strong public sentiment in its favour, these petty oultbreaks would have been long ago suppressed. Reading the morning journals here, you would sUppose that the town was in a constant state of anarchy; whereas most people really know nothing about the outbreaks until the reporters give the accounts ; Broadway is none the less travelled, and nooe the more dangerous. *The Money-Market is rather easy for this season of the year. Between the two crops money is always tight in New York, mainly occasioned by the demand for specie for shipment. This year there is nothing unusual with it, or nothing to excite the apprehension which has prevailed on the StockExchange. The public confidence seems lately to have been entirely and unaccountably withdrawn from the railway interest, which was so great a favourite, three or four years sincee. There is as little sense in the wholesale deninciations of the Heeald and the " bear" speculators as there was in the wholesale puffing by some other journals and the "bulls." When the new crops begin to be mown the trafflc returns will tell a different story from the present ones. Undoubtedly, there has been great mismanagement on the part of some of the companies, but this is no reason for condemning all, still less for the sweeping assertion that we are on the brink of a general crasb. This is assumed from the magnitude of the land speculations of the West. Undoubtedly, these will have an effect uponl the East. But the East has long foreseen it, and has been preparing to meet the trouble 'when it comes.
TPE PENIN,SULAR MAILS. (BY ELECTRIC AND INTERNATIONAL TELEGItAriE.) SOUTIIAMPTON, MONDAY EVENING. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamslhip Albaumbra, Captain Joy, has arrived with the Peninsular mails, in charge of Lientenant Newport, R.N. Her date, are Gibraltar, July 16; Cadiz, 17; Lisbon, 21. She brings 33 passengers, and on freight 442 chests of lemons, 75 hides, 76 boxes of onions, 5 baskets ditto, and 16 packages of sundries. On the 17th, at 8 p.m., off Capo St. Mary's, an accident occurred to the machinery, which detained the Albambra two days at Lisbon to repair, and she then proceeded home under half speed. This, together with the strong head winds experienced as far as Cape Finisterre, is the cause of the steamer being so much beyond her time. She will, of course, undergo a thorough repair before again proceeding to sea. The AIhanibra did not call at Oporto or Vigo on account of the accident. At Gibraltar.-Her Majesty's ship Vulture. The United States' frigate Constelltion sailed t6 bhe Eastward on the 15th. The only vessels of war at Lisbon were the French steamer La Bourdonnaye and the Dutch frigate Ruyter.

The Lisbon exchange on London had risen to 544, a' -which rate there was a fair demand for bils, and busines4 closed with money over at that figure. On the continent paper was offered, but money was very scarce. The following were the quotations for three months' date :-London 5412; Paris, 529; Genoa, 528; Hamburg, 48; Armsterdam, 421.

WffR DANUBIAN PRINCIPALITIBS. (IFOx oixa OWN ooxiTto1uDXr.) JASSY, JULY 17. I wrote to you in my last that the state of things in the Danubian Principalities was in almost hopeless confusion. In order to find out the causes of this confusion and the way to get out of it, I must repeat many things which your readers will know already, but it is necessary to remember the history of the commission, with all its episodes, to understand the present state of affairs. The commission owes its origin to the weakness and indeoision of the Turkish Government at the time of the Paris Conferences, and more especially to that of the Turkish Plenipotentiary, Aali Pasha. In the first conference at Vienna, in the spring of 1855, the French Plenipotentiary brought forward the idea of uniting Molda-via and Wallachia under one Government. The Turkish Plenipotentiary, who was asked whether the Porte would have any objection to such an arrangement, started the want of instructions from his Government, but promised to inform it of this proposal of the French Plenipotentiary. Before an answer could arrive the Conference broke up and the subject dropped for the moment. When, in the winter of the same year, the chances of peace increased it was agreed between the Western Powers, Turkey, Austria, and Sardinia, that a kind of preliminary conference should be held at Constantinople by the Plenipotentiaries of those Powers to come to an understanding between themselves, in order to act with greater concert and vigour at the Conferences of Paris. The subjects which were taken into discussion at this preliniinary conference related to those points which more e.-pecially involved the interests of Turkey-namely, the position of the non-Mahomedans in the Ottoman e7pire and the organization of the Danubian Principalities. The discussion about the first of these subjects was soon satisfactorily closed, or rather anticipated, by the publication of the Hatti Humayoun, placing the non-Mahomedans legally on the same footing with the Mahomedans. Not so the question of the future organization of the Principalities. The proposal of uniting Moldavia and Wallachia under the same Government was again brought forward by the French Ambassador, and urged much more strongly than at the Vienna Conferences in the spring of 1855. It was just as strongly opposed bythe Aus trian Minister. The Tarkish Government was in an embarrassing position. Well broken in during the war to comply with the wishes of the Ambassadors, it found itself all of a sudden in the position of having to decide a difference of opinion between two of those gentlemen. To make things worse, the Turkish Government itself was in a state of disorder. The Grand Vizier, Aali Pasha, had gone to Paris ; his temporary delegate, the Kaimakan Kibrisli Mehmed Pasha, speculating how to become himself Grand Vizier, was by no means anxious to promote the prosperity of the Government at whose head he was placed for the timebeing; but, even if he had been animated by the best meant ardour, he had too little influence over his Ministry to make them adopt his views. The members of the Cabinethad becomeaccustomedunder the mild rule of Aali Pasha to speculate in politics " on their own hook," as if they were so many independent Cabinets. flow was it possible under such circumstances to go through a mature deliberation and come to a vigorous decision? In the full Council, nevertheless, where many members were presentwho were not exposed to the rival influence of the Ambassadors, and who judged the question from the Turkish conservative point of view, the resolution was adopted, after much discussion, that the union of the two Principalities would be contrary to the original separate agreements by which Moldavia and Wallachia were annexed to Turkey, and that it would be calculated to menace the integrity of the Turkish empire. Whether this view was the right or the wronone, the Turkish Government ought to have acted frankly and sincerely upon it. Bat nobody dared to take the responsibility of such a step upmn himself, and the Turkish Government had at last recourse to a subterfuge. A compromise was proposed which referred the solution of this question to the Conference at Paris, and one of the first questions brought forward there was precisely that of the union of the two Danubian Principalities under one Government. Already, in the instructions which Aal Pasha took with him he was told not to give his consent to the union; after the conclusion of the preliminary conferences at Constantinople he received similar but much stronger instructions, which authorized him to protest against any such step, as contrary to the sovereign rights of the Sultan. Then, if ever, would have been the time for energetic action. If Turkey had made up her mind against the union, as something dangerous and incompatible with her integrity, she ought to have openly brought forward her objections, and it is more than probable that the allies, every one of whom protested that his only aim was to secure the integrity and welfare of theTurkish empire, would 'not have found Turkey wvilling to subscribe to an act which was in her eyes suicidal. If the question had been decided thus the organization of the Danubian Principalities, at least as regards general principles, might have been continued and finished in the Conference itsolf. Instead of acting in this manly way, after much telegraphing between Paris and Constantinople, Aali Pasha tried to parry the pressure by objecting that a union was against the wishes of the Principalities themselves. He was taken at his word, and the Congress decided upon sending a special commission to the Principalities, which was to ascertain, by means of a Divan or assembly convoked for the purpose in each province by Imperial firman, the wishes of the people. Such is the origin of the commission, and I have dwelt so long on its origin because it forms the key to its action, and explains, at the same time, the relative position of the parties. France had come, in one way or another, to the conclusion that the union was the most reasonable thing for every one, and that it was the general wish of the MoldoWallachians; while Austria and Turkey had equaUy fully persuaded themselves that it was a most dangerous innovation, and entirely against the desire of the Principalities themselves. l am not going to discviss the reason which induced the two parties to take such diametrically opposite views, but it was not difficult to foresee that both parties would do their utmost to prove their assertions. Both parties prepared for the campaign. Notes and memoranda without end were drawn up and communicated by each of the two narties, explaining, according to their points of view, the advantaiges or disadvantages of the union. In this diplomatic skirmishing France had decidedly the best of it, for even before the meeting of the commission the Russian, Prussian, and Sardinian Governments began to show a leaning towards her views, while since the formation of the commission they have openly gone over to her camp. Thus the world beholds the edifying spectacle that out of the seven Powers who had agreed to send a comnmission of inquiry into the Danubian Principalities six have made up their minds, even before the installation ol that commission, as to the desired result. England alone kept a dignified attitude, and took no part beforehand, but, appreciating the objections on both sides, reserved her judgment until after the Divans should have expressed their wishes, The newspapers were allowed to discuss the question, of course in the sense of their respective Governments, with great length of argument, so thai for the last 12 months you could scarcely find a single paper of note which did not daily contain something about the Principalities. It would have been well if the activity of the rival Governments had stopped there, but imfortunately it didnot. Both parties began through their agents in the Principalities themselves to prepare the minds of the population to embrace their viewvs. I need not remind your readers that when they hear of an agent of a great foreign Power in these regions they must not have that qniet, unobserved, and modest being in their minds vhich goes under the denomination of a ConsulGeneral or consular agent in a great European country. They will be nearer the mark if they imagine him like the Residents of so many rival East India Companies at the Court of a native Rajah. Every one bows down and wforships them, the particle "no' is erased from th e dictionary of the native functionaries, Now, fancy a disputed question arising, like that of the union, anti both parties pressing the native Government to follow their disinterested advice. The chief functionary of the Government,' under whatever denonination he may come, rises from his couch with trembling, and he has scarcely time to dress when the noise of carriage wheels announces already a visit from one of these gentlemen, who makes him perspire for a couple of. hours. At length the first departs, and he has scarcely had thme to wipe his iorehead before the rattling of another carriagel renews the process. E For more than 12 months the succeeding chiefs of the Moldavian and Wallachian Governments have been undergoing this infliction, and it speaks well for their good constitutions that only one has died, and not one of them gone quite mad. But more obnoxious even than this pressure I on the Governments of Moldavia and Wal- lachia was the effect which such an open partisanship on the Hide of all, the great Powers, with the exception of one, exerted on the -population. Instead of preparing themselves by a careful study of their own country and its want, which are almost unknown to the greater.part-evtn of the educated classes, for the arrival of the i European Commission, which they 'had to inform of their wishes, they caught up the party cry of "Union"' and "No union," and forgot everything else. It was thu* through the agency of the foreign agents that 'the agitation took such dimensions, and has divided the whole popu- I lation into two rival camps, between which a con- I ciliation is all bat hopeless. Had the example of, England been followed by all the others the disagreement could never have become ao great. The majority would have given their attention to seasonable internal reforms, rather than t*o a vague word, which willgetitstrue meaning onlyfromthe detailed dispositions which will accompany it. frgIta To have free action in the Principalities fraia tion both the Unionists and their adversaries werej interested in haviDg a local Government devoted to their views, and thig gave rise to the first struggle. between the rival influences. After the outbreak in MoIdavia and Wallachia in the year 1848 Princes Michael Stourdza and Alexander Ghika were deposed by the Tarkish Go- vernment in concert with the Russians, and a pro-I visional Government established,withPrinceA named for seven years at its head. These were Stirbey for Wallachia and Gregory Ghika for Moldavia. Their firmans having been signed in September, 1849, their time was up last year about the same time. The Prince of Wallachia pronounced and acted from the first against, and that of Moldavia for, the union. Attempts were therefore made at Constantinople, even before the expiration of their time, to remove them, the Anstrians demanding the I removal of. Prince Ghika from Moldavia, and the French that of Prince Stirbey from Vallachia, the i grounds brought forward on both sides being that they had overstepped their powers, and that by remaining for some time after the Russian occupation during the war against the orders of the Porte they had forfeited aU right to their places. But, as both parties were tolerably equally balanced at Constantinople, and neither of them had strength enough to obtain the nomination of Kaimakans or governors of their own opinion for both Principalities, both Princes were left in their places till within a few days before the expiration of the seven years. When this term approached, and Kaimakans had! to be named according to the treaty to govern pro- I visionally the two Principalities until the final or- I ganization of them, the Turkish Government proposed M. MAano for Wallachia and Theodore Balsch for Moldavia, both of them anti-Unionists, or rather supporters of any Government from which they had something to expect. This proposal raised a cry of indignation on the Unionist side, especially against the man destined for Wallachia, who enjoyed the worst political and even private reputation in the country. After much writing and taLking, al astha comprocmise was come to. M. Mano was given up, and, instead ofhni, thelastaPrincebut one, Alexander Gbika, a man well known for his liberal viewvs, was chosen for Wallachia. This compromise suited the Turks sO much the more as it gave them free action in that portion of thePrincipalitieswhere they had aline the chance of, success. With more penetration than people give them credit for, they saw from. the beginning that Moldavia was the key of the position. Wallachia being the greater and more populous part, it was difficult to persuade the people there, that the union with Moldavia would have any disadvantage, while in Moldavia they would surely reckon on partisans if they coildwork upon the apprehension that, instead of a union, it would be an absorption for Moldavia, and that this latter country would have certainly to follow in the wake of her larger neighbour. In fact, they calculated on the revival of the old feuds betwveen the two countries. This has been and is sti the leading idea in the separatist camp, and a plan of campaign was accordingly drawn up. Wallachia was all but abandoned to the influence of the Unionists, and aU efforts concentrated on Moldavia. How far they have been successful you will see from my next letter.
INSOLVENT DBBTORS' COURT, J.dy 27. I -- - IN B G. W. IIOWAIRU. (BefOre the COmEp CoMmnssioNmR Lms insolvent, tne nephew aud presumptive heir of the Earl of Wicklow, appeared again to-day, pursuant to adjourniuient. Mr. S,ARCOOD, on behalf of the ineolvent, applied for a further adjournment, as the required aniendumient to the schedule had not been filed in conseqnence of Mr. Howard's ill-health. It was further desirable that a meeting for proof of debts should be held, as Mr. Howard was in expectation that an arrangement could be effected with the bonOd fide eseditors, which would prevent the neces,sty of any adjudication by this Court. The CHiEF COmuiSSIONER yielded to the first application and gr.nted a further adjournment, but declined to appoint any mueeting for proof of debts at present, as he coneidered such a proceeding would be useless until the required amendments were filed. The case was then again adjourned to the 17th-of htovem. ber, the iusolvent's bail being enlarged in the meantime. I2 RE WILLIAM CAVILL. This insolvent, who had been a journeyman printer and maker-up of the Sheffield Free Press, was oppo-ed by Mr. Dowse for Mr. Isaac Ironsides, and supported by Mx. Sargood. The opposing creditor is the proprietor of the Shefflse Free Press, which he agreed to sell to the insolvent, who had worked upon it, for 1,2501., of which 2501. was to be paid down. The insolvent gave his L 0. U. for 2501. The urchase was not completed. Mr. Irontides, however, !rought an actionagainst him, and a verdict was given on the L 0. U, and he was now in prison. He had parted with some little property, and made payments, of which complaint was now inade. The CIIIEF CO1mThSSIOSNER characterized the action as a i barsh proceeding. As the insolvent bad parted with what he possessed it was a case for a judgment, but would be nDerely nominal. The judgment was five weeks from the 27th of June, which would delay the discharge only a few days.

IRELAND. (FRom OUR OWN Cam o D-wUw. DUBLIJN, MoNDAY MORtNING. THE REPRESENATION OF GALWAY. Mr. Wiliam Smith O'Brien, with doubtful taste, has written a long letter to a,tfr. M4artin O'Flaherty, of Galway, revealing for the first time all the particulra in connexion 'with the celebrated search of MJIr. O'Brien's portmanteau immediately after his capture, and while under the charge of MajorGeneral John M'lonald. As the document may be said to belong to the history of the mock rebellion of 1848, it is annexed without curtailment:- "Cahermoyle, New Castle West, July 21. "My dear O'Flaherty,-I have no hesitation in complying 'with your request that I should relate to you the history of may celebrated portmanteau, and you may make any use you thinlk fitof my narrative at the approaching Galway election "When Iwaa captured atTThurles, in 1848, I was taken into a room in which were General h'Donald, Mr. Gore Jones, and some other persons. General M'Donald, who appeared to be nearly as much excited on the occasion as I was, though proably tLnder very different influces, immediately proffered to me various civilities, which were tendered, I must admit, in a verv incoherent mnanner. He offered me a battle of champagne, and he told me that he ha) been the guest of my father or brother at Dromoland, and that if there was anythieg that he could do for me that would contribute to my comfort he would be happy to comply with my wishes. I was completely thrown off' my guard by this sort of address, and, believing that I was in the hands of a gentleman, I said to him that I declined his proffered hospitalities, but thAt a -I had been for some days without a chauge of dress it would be a great cotnfort to me to obtain at once a portmanteau which;I had left at the house of a friend in CasheL He declared that I should have it, gave me no intimation that it would be searched and Mr. Gore Jones, or one of the other'officials, received a letter from me authorizing its delivery to the bearer of my note. It did not occur to me at the time that there was in the portmanteau any document that could compromise either myself or any one else; but I confess that, even if there had been in it such papers, I could not have believed it possible that a general officer obtaining possession of it, not by way of capture but upon an honourable understanding, would have allowed it to be rifled by State detectives of any grade whatsoever. On the day after my arrival in Dublin the clothes which the portmanteau contained wrere delivered to me, and it is due to the oflicials of the Castle to say that the only articles of wearing apparel that appeared to have been abstracted were a set of studs, which I have never seen since my cap. "It wiU not be forgotten that in consequence of the digs covery in my portmanteau of a letter written to me by Charles Gavan Duffy, the indictment against him was changed from a charge of 'Treason Felony' to a charge of IHigh Treason.' For several weeks I suffered much pain of mind, not only from indignation against those who had thus kidnapped my letters, but also from self-reproach for having, through my confiding inadvertence, compromised the safety. of a friend. Lord Clarendon and his officials, however, met with the retribution which they deserved, for the change of indictment against Mr. Daffy led them into such a succession of blun. ders and acts of meanness that the public feeling at length revolted against this prosecution, and Mr. Daff, who would probably have been transported on the original indictment with as much promptitude as had been shown in the case of Mr. Xitchell, completely baffled the law officers of the Crown in a succession of trials which, in point of duration, in point of vindictive persecution, in point of unworthy artifices used to procure conviction, were, I believe, unmatched in the annals of British judicature. Mr. Duffy enjoyed also the triumph of meeting at the hustings of New Ross and of putting to rout Sir Thomas Redington, who was the chief performer in the episode of the portunantean. "I have been informed and believe that when my portmanteau arrived in Dublin it was carried to the Castle, that its contents were there examined most minutely by Sir Thomas Redington, and that all the letters which it c ntained were read by Sir Thomas Redington in the p7esence of his ;private secretary. That there can be no doubt as to the minuteness of this examination is proved by the circumstance that every paper bears the initials of either Sir Thomas Redington or of his private secretary. The papers contained in the portmanteau were of a most miscellaneous kdnd. Letters from priv ate friends, scraps of poetry, bills and receipts, political memoranda, visiting cards, registry certificates, medical prescriptions, legal I apers, rentals, ac.; in short, they wera a collection of papers which had accumulated during my stay in Dublin and which I had taken with me to the country, with a view to transfer them to Cahermoyle, "To any candid and generous minds the contents of the portmanteau would have afforded sufficient evidence to produee a conviction that I could not have conteisplated an imxnediateinsurrectionwhen I left Dublin, for insuch a case it was utterly impossible that I Ehould have taken papers of this description with me on my excursion to the county of Wexford. Yet, in spite of this presumption, the agents of ' the Castle' made every possible effort on my trial to prove that I had gone down to wexford and Tipperary with the intention of raising an immediate rebellion. The fact was that I bad long been fully convinced that resistenco to the British Parliament was the duty of every Irishman, but I had been extremely anxious to avert as long as possible a collision on account of the terrible and uncertain ha7ards of such a strife, and it was not until the Irish nation had been deprived of the right of trial by jury, by the suspension of the beas Corpus Act (of wbich proceeding I first became apprized when I was in the county of-Wexford), that I resolved finaUly to call upon the people to take up arms in open resistance to misgovernment. "Daring my imprisonment (I forget the exact date) a large proportion of the papers which my portmanteau had containe were restored to me, but under circumstances which left no doubt on my mind that they had undergone manipulation and close inspection by the subotdinate officials of the Castle as well as by Sir Thomas Redington; and some letters written to me by my wife have never yet been returned to me. " Now, I shall leave to others the task of determining how far the conduct of Sir Thomas Redington on this occasion was or was not consistent with the character of an Irish gentleman. As he had the advantage of being educated at an English University it is to be presumed that he had learnt there the principles of honour which are in vogue among English statesmen. Had he been a wretched stipendiary of the British Government, whose sole means of existence depended upon his official salary, I should have found some apology for his having undertaken to do the dirty work of En=land; but he is, I believe, possessed of an independent fortune, and was rot compelled by any overrurlin exigency to act as a detective for England. Notbeing, I trust, very vindictive in ny disposition, I would willsnglyhaveforgiven this transact tion if my own private feelings alone were concerned, 1 ut I stil continue to cherish some regard for our national pride and for our national honour, though, alas! the confidence which I once placed in the noble ientiments of my fellow-countrymen as greatly impaired. It therefore seems to me that it would be an eternal disgrace to the Irish nation, if a single constituency could be found in this island which would confer popular honours as a zeward for such conduct, or select as its representative a rnan who has acted such a part towards one whose chief aim in life has been to vindicate the rights of his oppressed fellow-countrymen, and especially of those who belong to the religious persuasion which is professed by Sir Thomas Redington. " If Sir Thomas deeerves to be rewarded for his services, I venture to suggest that it is from the English people, not from Irishmen, still less Roman Catholics, that he ought to receive the meed of such deservings. It is possible that there are many constituencies in England to whom he could not recommend himself more effectually than by proclaiming tbat he had aided in rifling the portmanteau of an Irish rebel who was induced by the allurements of a British General to place it within his grasp. " I send you a few specimens of the sort of documents which the portmanteau contained; you will perceive that they are marked with the initials of Sir Thomas Redington or his private secretary. "Such are the adventures, so far as I am acquainted with them, of my portmauteau. If from misconception or incorrect information Ihave misstated them in any respect, I shall he glad to be corrected by Sir Thomas Redington. " I remaitn, my dear O'aherty, with much esteem and regard for you, yours very sincerely. " MILLat ' S. O'BRaet" Mr. Martin O'Elaherty."
DEATH OF THE HON. WLLIAMi L. MIARCy.-The death of Governor Marcy appears to have been occasioned by heart disease. The Albany Atlas of yesterday statesthat be visited Albany on Friday, and was then apparently in excellent health and buoyant spirits. It was only within ashort time of his death that he became conscious of a palpitation of the heart, and the symptoms of that disorder had not been such as to occasion alarm to himself or his friends. The funeral was to have taken place inAlbany this day. The president and his Cabinet excused themselves from attendine it on the ground of pressing business. Mr. Marcy was pre- p to leave for Europe when death put a period to his existce. The sudden and rather mysterious nature of his death has led many to suppose that he committed suicide. The Boston T?raveler gives currency to this opinion. A correspondent of the Albany Argus. under date July 4. gives the following particulars of bis last moments :-" rhis morning he complained of a slight pain, or I stitch,' as he termed it, in his back. About 11 o'clock a.m., accompanied by one of our citizens, he walked to the residence of Dr. L. Moore, which is about one quarter of a mile from the hotel. He did Dot complain of serious indisposition while at the doctor'sresidence, and, not finding the physician in, on Feing asked if a carriage should be ordered to take him to the hotel, he refused to take one and walked back. On arriving at the hotel he requested the office clerk to send the doctor to his ropm; and the doctor soon arriving, was sent up to the Governor's room, but, on rapping, received no answer. The doctor returned to the hotel-office and informed the clerk, and it vms sup. posed that the Governor had gone to visit sombe friends m the honse. The doctor, however, after waiting a few minutes, again went up to his room, opened the door, and found him lying on his couch, wvith a book upon his breast, dead ! It could not have been more than 20 minutes from the time he was in the hoteloffice until he was so found by the physician. He died, probably, of disease of the heart; not a muscle was distorted, nor any article of apparel, or furniture in the room, disturbed. He ad pulled off his boots and put on his slippers:'~-A,nrtczn paper.

RAILWAY INTBLLIGENCR. ELECTRIC AND CERNATIONA TELEGRAPH COlAIPAVY. 'Xie directors of this company state in their report that the amount expended on capital account for the halfyear is 3,3211. The revenue account of the half-year just expired shows a satisfactory increase over the corresponding period of last yea*, and the directors state there is no reason to doubt the con. tinuance of the progressive development of the receipt which has been shown in each successive, report. Tho receipts for the half-year ending June, 1853, amounted to 47,661. ; ending June, 1854, to 61,2161. ; endingJune, 1855, to 67,6891.; ending June, 1856 to 78,5161. and ending June, 1857, to 89,4521. After, meeting all contingencies and writing off 6791. for depreciation on stores, the directors are enabled to recommend a dividend at the rate of 81. per cent. per annum, leaving 1,7371. to be added to the reserve fund, which wrill then amount to 11,0421.- A new and more efficient systemof insulation has beenadopted, and the whole expenditureso incurredhasbeen defrayed from revenue. Aportionof theexpenditureforrenowal and insulation will extend over the ensmng half-year, but the amount will be considerably diminished, and before its expiration it is probable that only the ordinary maintenance and workin expenses wll be debited against receipts. The directorstave watched with much interest the measures now being taken toestablishatelegriphle communication with the United States, and, although they have not conaldered themselves justified in investing any portion of the property of the shareholders in the enterpriso of the Atlantic Telegaph Company, they, nevertheless, anxiously desire the success of an undertaking calculated to confer such immense banefit on the two countries, to be, by its means, so closely united. An arrangement has been entered into with' the Atlantic Telegraph Company, in coniunction with the Magnetic Telegrap, on terms mutualy beneficial, which will insure a cordial co-operation, and render the three systems available for providing the requisite facilities for the transmission and reception of the Americanl correspondence. The continued support and assistance affordedby the Government of the Netnerlands, the amicable relations which exists between this Company and the continental telegraphs with which they are working, and the great improvement in tho service of the foreign lines generany is most gratifying. In conclusion, the Board congratulate the shareholders on the sound and healthy state of the great undertaking in which their capital is invested. 1'he report of Mr. L6 Clark, the engineer, states that during the half-year ending June, 1857, the electric telegraph has been extended over 41 miles of net line, and 311 additional miles of wire have been added to the system; of which 242 were for commercial use, and 69 for railway par- oses. 63 additional instruments and bells have been fed, leaving the present extent of the system as follows: -M3les of line, 5,439; miles of wire, 28,938; number of instruments, 2,172; number of bells, 665. The results of their experience on tho lines fitted with, the new system of insulation are exceedingly satisfactory, and amply realize the sanguine anticipations he had ventured to express to the directors. Notwithstanding the damage occasioned by ships' anchors to the submarine cables, no interruption to their continental and Irish communications has been experienced during the present year. The apprehensions as to the cost of the repairs of the cables entertained at the close of last year have proved to be exaggerated. Three wires to the Hague are in full working order; a fourth may be rendered available on emergency by the use of special instruments. He concludes his report by calling the attention of the shareholders to the rapid advances in the art of telegraphy which have been made, continually though quietly, in every branch of the undertaking, as well as to the increased effi. ciency of the continental system, and states that it is scarcely seven years since it was considered a feat to telegraph direct to Manchester, and messages had usually to we witten out at Rugby and re-transmitted. At the Dresent day, the communicationto all the principal towns of Great Britain is continuous and instantaneous; and it is their constant and hourly practice to transmit intelligence direct from London to such cities as Amsterdam, Hamburg, Hanover, Frankfort, Cologne, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, Dantsic, Konipsbnrg, Galatz, and not unfrequently to St. Petersburg itself. Yet such is the marvellous character of the elemest they employ that distance scarcely exerts a perceptible influence on the time of its flight, and their signals are exchanged ncross these immense distances in a small fraction of a second. The balanee-sheet shows a total of 863,385,including 808.3101. raised on capital account. The revenue account for the half-year ending June 30 shows that 86,377Z. had been received and 53,4651. expended, the interest on loans 2,6631., leaving a balance of 30,7481, TRAFIC RETURNS.

FsE AsD Loss OF IdFE.-Yesterday'moming a fire attended with serious destruction of property and fatal consequences to one if not two persons, besides jeopardizing the lives of nearly a dozen other persons, happened in the promises occupied oonjointly by M1r. Maidman, saddle sud harness-maker, Mr. Stephen John Grey, a writisngmnster, andl Mr. oassey, anartist, at No. 14, Eigh Holborn, next door to Mlessrs Hollingsworth's auction rooms. The discovery was made shortly before 3 o'clock by the policeman'on duty,who succeed in arousing most of the inmates. In the first second, and third tloors were persons screaming londly for help and beseeching the Reighbours to send for the fireescapes. Some of the occupants managed 'to effect a safe retreat. Four or five other persons were, however, unable to pass either up or down the stairs, owing to the violence of thei flames. Fortunately, the Royal Society'o fire escapes froma Bedford-row and Hatton-garAieu stationst under th oommand of Conductors Edward, Dunk and Harkwell, came up, and they resced a prson named Edward E. Massy from one of the u Lir windbws, -and two other personswerebroughtfrom thetird floorby Harkwell. An apprentice was takenfrom theoback part of the premises very much injured from the fire, and was conveyed to St. BaLrtholomew's Hospital. An elderly man namned Chapel wa burnt to death in the scnd floor. Several ofthe adt. jacent buildings were inured by the fire, and altogether the damage done to property WM cozsiderable,
