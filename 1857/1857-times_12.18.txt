BAILWA A AND AENING SHABES. Thursday Evening. In the railway-market there has been a general advance of i to 11 per cent., which was well maintained to the close; Alidland, however, and Great Western, after marking respectively 880 and o2, partially relapsed. Great NWorthern were especially in demand, leaving off 2t- per cent. higher than yesterday; in other descriptions Caledonian and North-Eastern stocks ehow the greatest improvement. North Staffordshire were bought to some extent on the report of a probable reunion with the London and North-Western. Indian and Canadian shares also advanced, except Great Western of Canada, which remain flat frona the con, inued falling off in the traffic. French were slightly better. A principal feature in the transactions of the day has been the demand for the low-priced foreign lines, and Lonmbardo-Venetian, Dutch Rhenish, Antwerp and Rotterdam, Great Luxembourg, and Samnbre and Mense closed at an improvement; a rise of about 11. also occurred in Pernambuco. In American securities Illinois Central declined $1. Mines were dull, and without any alteration of importance. Joint-atock banks were quiet, and in some cases slightly receded; Union of London, however, left off 10s. higher. In miscellaneous securities a fractional advance took place in Australian Agricultural and the discount companies.

AIZWTAY IrlTZLLIGENUB. gn4TvnO?2 A special meeting of this company was held yesierday a the office, Gresham-house, Old Broad.street, for the purr of authoriing the issue of shares to the amount of 50%,0f to be entitled to a guaranteed interest at the rate of 5 peg cent. per annum- Mr. Andrews, the chairman, presided. The CnAIRMIAX' explained that it was necessary they should raise the additional capital to enable the company to c&rry out controct that had been too long delayet' They were bound by the originad agreement wvitz the East India Company to pay to them on thfg additional capital 25 per cent, by the 17th of Marcl next, and to enable the shareholders to meet this demand j early as possible it was proposed that two calls of 21. I0s each should be made. (Hear.) This would give them ; long a period of time for the payment of tfe amount ^ circumstances would admit of. The estimated cost of the line, as caloulated by the Government engineers, was about 750,0001. The East India Company, however, had given I guarantee on 500,0001. only, and the board now aske4 the shareholders to permit the original capital to ha doubled; not that the board thought the whole of the additional 500,0001. would be required, but the granting of that amount would put the company in a proper peoition to complete the lne with advantage to themselves, iEt concluded by moving a formal resolution authorizing the creation and issue of additional capital to the amounC of 500,0001., for the completion of the Scinde Railwvay, in shares of 201. each, to be offered to the existing shareholdem in the proportion of one new shara for one old share in the present guaranteed capital of the company, the first call of 51. being payable by two instalments of 21. 10s. each on tha 29th of January and the 15th of March next. Sir IL M&nDoX, in seconding the resolution, said tha cost of the works, including rolling stock, would be between. 7,0001. ard 8,0001. per mile. He trusted the whole outlay wouldanot exceed800,0001. (Hear.) The resolution was put and carrfed. After some observations on the capabilities of the port ot Kurrachee, and the advantiges of the railway, a vote of thanks was passed to the chairman and directors, and tho meeting separated. LANCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE AND EAST LANCASHIRE. Yesterday, at a meeting of the Preston Town Council; Mr. Alderman Catterall moved that the Mayor and Meagre. J. Goodair, Naylor, Swainson, Livesey, Parker, and Cat.4 terall be a committee to watch the Iancashire and Yorkshire Amalgamation Bill, and to take such steps as they may deem advisable for protecting the interests of the borough. and limiting the amount to be charged by the amalgamniw& companies fortolls and carriages. He said the motion was one of considerable importance to the trading interest of the town, and, in fact, to every inhabitant. Althon lz at the outset the competing railway companies he out to the public that the competition would be to thol advantage, they now sought to amalgamate, and thus deprive the public of those advantcges they were snp. posed to hove gained when the Companies were originall formed. They should therefore endeavour to have such reasonable provisions inserted in the Bill as vwould pro. teat the interestg of the public generally. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Alderman HuBIIR seconded the resolution, which was unanimously agreed to, and the comnmittee was appointed accordingly. TRAYFC RETURNS. umlea pat- mer. TotAl.

FOREIGN INTELLICBIYCBW FRANCE. (FROMI OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) (BY SUB'R1TIE AND BRrr1SH TELEGnAPH.) We have received the following telearam from our )Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, TRURSDAY, DEC. 17, 8.30 A.M. " An Imperial decree in the Moniteur announce, ibat foreign brandies have to pay on inportation luto France a daty of 25f. per hectolitre of pure .$AcohoL" A11S, WEDNESDAY, Dac. 16, 6 P.M. WYithin the last few days a pamuphlet on the IndJas question has appeared in Paris-I can hardly say has been published, because it is all but un]mown to the public. An attempt has been made to force it into publicity, but as yet without avail. It comes forth anonymously, and is entitled " Des ,Se'diwents de Jutstice ct d'tumfsdnitM de l'Asngleterre clans la Qscesticrn Ivdieine." Some peculiar eireambtaxnces mark this brochure. The publisher, whose lranie appears on the title-page, is not, I believe, g. publisher in the strict sense of the word; he is Mlerely a bookseller, and deals principally, if not entirely, in rare editions of old works, which he buyd up at sales and disposes of to amateurs who have a taste for such things, and are rich enough to in- dulge it. The object of the author of the pamphlet I Is to show that the British are quite as bad, if not Wvcrse, than the Hindoos, who, he states, are all in insurrection against the English ; and that, bad as are the acts of the Sepoys, we have, during our occupation of the country, done no less to the iuhabitants. The 180 pages of the book display a mnost malignant feeling, while in ignorance and misrepresentationthey can hardlybe surpassed. Among the few persons who have as yet seen it it lias been stated tOat this diatribe is the production of a well known soldier. It is impossible to give credit to such a fact. Ybat individual stands too high for such an imprutation to reach him; and, even had he not been knlown to have always kept aloof from politics, Isis position in the Crimea, his rank, and his knowledge of our army and of the English, of whose charaoter he is known to liave frequently expressed adiniration, would utterly forbid such a suspicion. Ooe would rather attribute it to Russian agency, With a view to excite a bad feeling among the superficial and the ignorant classes of the people. There are persons, and those not among the obscurer tools of Russia, wbo, for reasons best known to I tbemselves, cherish an intense batred to everything Eanlish-such hatred as is found only among the base-and who would willingly lend a hand in the 1wv-rk. To show the anirnus with which the anonynious writer performs his task I give the following extracts. The writer says:- " We give to the French press neither a chronological Imistory of India nor a political discussion on the confiscation of India by England. Others abler than we are will Ylo this duty, hut ve address to the press a brief defence of .he Tndians, whom it appearsto condemn too lightly on tho lnterested assertions of England. We mean to be brief in irder to be read; we have cited bat few facts, but their value will sufficiently establish the trath of our assertions. He who wishes to enter more deeply into the sabject will End accumulated in such number the accusing proofs agalnst England that their imposing mass may be designated a pyramid of Euglish iniqnity. "Tmhe press his for its noblest mission to defend every~ waere, and at all times, the rights of humanity. Eagland, bo tumultuoasly philanthropic in her relations with :Europe, must be recalled by the unanimous cry of the press to the sentiments of moderation which She incessantly preaches to the Governments of Enrope. It is not enough to say that India is now the resort of rigands to give her the rights of extermination; the pross wlll demand of her an account hour by hour of tho mannerin which sho employs her sword of justice. One is already but tootwell disposed to take the part of India, to understand the gerrible explosion of the Indian Vrespess, and to agree with the last Nabob of Bengal, who in 173O left as instractions ko his successor these remarkable words :-' The hearts of the English are given up to the love of gold and of do. minion, and their acts have proved to the entire East how little they regard the precepts they have received from God. Their policy and their power are in opposition to thelr faith. I repeat ic to yoa, my son, crash the English. If prou allow them to have among you factories and soldiers tho land on which you reign will soon be theirs."' At page 11 the writer says "India has nevor, properly speaking, bean conquered by England. She at first presented hersolf there under pretext of trade, and by little and little, and by means of corrup. tion, aud by fermenting wars between the different native princes, she ended by appropriating to herself the soveteignty of this vast country. It ill becomses the English to talk of the proverbial bad faith of the Indians, of their lissimulation and their ingratltude; tho Indians mnay, on £ar better grounds, fling at them the charge." The writer refises to give credit to the accounts published to the world of all the atrocities comminted on helpless women and children by the Sepoys " We do not doubt that there have been massacres of Europeans, but what we do doubt is the number of the victims, the kind of death they endured, and tho part taken in these crimos by the native chiefs. We do not accept without examination the letter addressed to 2Tac Tivne on the 13th Septenmber lasb by a person named Shepherd, a SPy in the English service. His account Is foll of improlbabilities-but, suppose it to be correct, we ask, have the English never given to the Indians the example of the atroci. ties which have again spread dismay among manlind l" On the subject of torture the writer says:- 1' For 46 years the East India Company has ignored the facts, or rather allo wed them to be committed. The Company has its agents, who employ torture to wring their las t Farthing from poor peasants, and that inoney, wet with blood and tears, is not employed eithor In the material well. being of the people or in the inmprovement of their inteUigence, It enters the coffers of the Company or those of the 3nglish Government, and gives great salaries to the cm. p?lojic' and good dividends to the shareholders. The ludians,-those tigers with hunian faces, as 2Vrc Times calls thcm.-at last revolt; those 'capricious and violent ari- | mali,' treated with contempt, and oppressea beyond measure, ! rise on their oppressors; they desire to shake off the English yoko and EBnglish oppression, and to free themselve; from English contempt ; they desire to oppose the return of lorture; they have 4G years of torture to pay back on Eng. lAnd, and they take up arms." After describing the manner in which the Hindoos are tortured by the Company, he exclaims- " Certainly, never did the imagination of the executioners -of the middle ages, nor that of the rmost ferocious planters of America, devise more atroclous means to torture human creatures, and if any one, and the least cruel, of those Mneans, had ever been applied by order of the Emperor of ,Austria or the Kinigof Naples,Englandwouldhave sent forth Lshouts of indignation, and thenames ofthose two Sovereigns would be this day affixed to the piUory of public indigna. tion. These tortures are inflicted in the 19th century on Ithe unfortunate Indians, and thoir object Is the colleotion of the imposts which are apphed to pay the huge salaries of the English functionaries, younger sons of great English families, and the dividends of the Company's shareholders. llnglish philanthropy does not think it necessary to stir It-elf." On the day of humiliation and general fast he Dbserves- " One day, one day only, England, under the Influence of a great panic, orders a general humiliation in her temples before the anger of the Lord. That day she confesses her mDinies, and covers her head with ashes. The next day she f,ings ofl the ashes of this affected repentance, and, burning for revenge more fiercely than the day before, she cals for iho extermination not only of those who had committed Aqssassination, but of the whole of the Indians, near or fromr afar, who may have taken part In the revolt." The foUlowing is meant by the writer ss a home "ha,ast 'We might ask of the English why, when they feel So %uch virtuous indignation against the Indians who preach nsp revolt and the destruction of their eountry's oppresor, they encourage and ferment everywhere in Enrope the awakenlng of what they call nationalities-that is to say,the %brogation of the treaties in which their Government took part on the reorganization of Europe In 1815-why they tlink it so natural that Italians and lungarians shouldrevolt mg-inst Austria, Poland against Russia, whle they refuse the samc to Malta, to the Ionian Islands, to Gibraltar, and to India I We might ask why they who are so indignant .igainst the Indians keep in London the preparers, the pro. maoters of political assassination, and the convicted and concemned accomplices of those assassinations,not to speak of the .whole staff of Soialists who, from the depth of their retreat, and under English protection, preach the extermination of he upper classes of society by the lower classes ?" The author touches on the history of. Lord Clive '*vith the view of proving the English to be ti-eacherous and perjured. H e adds:- "We do not mean to xcuse abominable ma rders, but rThe following appeared iu our aeond odition of yes, te.dav :-I we show by irrefragable proofs that England less than any other nation has the right to be pitiless, for she also has been as barbarous towards the Indians as the Indians are now to her-for she charged herself with a numerous people, and she has done nohming for their morality, their instruction, or their well-being. "We do not preach to theIndians revolt against England, we do not establish committees to encoarage insurrection I against the British nation, though England has 20 times set us the example by her committees In favour of Poland, Italy, and Hungar-. We do not cry ont to any people to tako up arms and break the yoke that oppresses them; we speak only in the nanme of humanity and civilization. We do not in a spirit of low jealousyI exult at tho evils which strike Bngland, but we do not vwishs! that she should have the right to preach to other people the principles which she doss not apply at home. We do not wish that she should make a virtue of the abolition of the slave trade, proclaimed by her when America won her independence, while she herself keops in the moost abject slavery 140,000,000 of human creatures, and arrogates the right to dispose of their existence, as she would not dare to do with animals. We do not wish that the philanthropic England shall any longer deck herself with that usurped title, and it is for this that we have lifted up a corner of the veil which covers from Europe the sight of India. We have not sought to inquire whether England was guided by the general interest of the civilized world in uniting Europe agalnst the ambitious designs of Russia ard the projects of conquest of Persia, We have not demanded of her an account of the support, at least the moral support, she gives to the Caucasus. We have not the pretension to touch on great political questions. Earope will some day be brought on this ground by the force of facts." He alludes to the proceedings in Parliament against Warren Hastings, and says :-" India was again sacrificed to its executioners in spite of the coalition of Pitt, Fox, Bnrke, and all the great orators of the Chamber. Eastings was acquitted- not only acquitted but rewarded ;" and, with ani admirable acquaintance with the history of these acts, concludes-" El:astings received a peerage very soon after !" The author is of course of opinion that though England may suppress the insurrection, she will, sooner or later, lose not only India, but the whole of her colonies. The place of librarian to the Emperor became vacant a few days back by the death of the person filling it. During the next two days no less than 400 applications were sent in for it. The situation is said to be worth 8,0X)00. or 9,000f., and is probably al but a sinecure, as it has been suppressed. It. was the only way of preventing jealousies. No one being preferred, the whole 400 are of course equaUy dissatisfied. The Akhbar, of Algiers, which has repeatedly Icomplained of the irregularity wvith which news is transmitted by the submarine telegraphic cable lately laid down betwveen Mbarseilles and Algiers, says, in its last number, under the head of " Progress of the Mediterranean Cable,"- " This electrio cable is making a sensible progress from bad to worse. It ought to give us news from Marseilles in two hours at the most. It has given us news in 24 honrsthen in 36 hours-then in 48 hours-and, finally, it has arrived at 72 hoars, which is proved by a telegraphic message before us, which was despatched from Marseilles on the 4th December, and arrived at Algiers on the 7th."

About half a year ago the Austrian Ministerlal Councllor Von Lackenbacher was sent on a secret missIon to Constantinople, and some information as to its nature has been given me. Shortly before M. von Lackenbacher left Vienna for the Turkish capital an English company was endeavouring to obtain from the Porte permissiona to establish a bank, which was to have the privilege of issuing notes. By some means or other the Austrian Government obtained information of what was going on, and it lost no time in calling the attention of the Porte to the fact that the power and influence of England must necessarily become excessively preponderant in Turkey, if the privilege of establishing such a bank as that above-mentioned was granted to any of her bankers or merchants. At the same time the talents and experience of M. von Lackenbacher were placed at the disposal of the Turkish Government, and that gentleman was soon after sent to Constantinople as the non-official Councillor of the Turkish Finance Department. It is also stated that M. von Lackenbacher exercises considerable influence on one of the organs of the Constantinople press, and there is reason to believe that the report is not devoid of foundation. It may be observed that the Anglo-Turkish Bank athair had made such orogres3 before the Austriaus interfered that the Brltn.ih speculators could have carried their point had they wished so to do. The British Ambassador afforded his powerful support and protection to the British Company, but, for some unknown reason, the latter declined to make the deposit which Was to precede the granting of the concession. Lord Stratford must have left Constantinople on the 9th inst., and have had a special steamer at his disposal, for he will reach Vienna this evening. Telegraphic news has already becn received that he has passed Laibach. The 10,000,000 of marks banco have given such satisfaction to the Hamburgers that they have applied for another 5,000,000, and the probability is that they will obtain them. Some of the Directors of the Austrian Bank are said to object to any further assistance being given, but their opinion is not likely to be listened to if it does not coincide with that of Baron Bruclr. During the last week or ten days enormous quantities of Austrian irldustriei stock have been sent here from Hamburg, Berlin, and Prague, and the consequence is that the market is completely glutted. According to reliable private advices from St. Petersburg, the new Russian railroad " promises" cannot be got rid of at any price. The Theiss and Western Railroad Companies will be empowered by Government to raise 30,000,00()fl. by means of a lottery. It is said that the shares will bear no interest, but that there will be four drawings of very large prizes in each year. On the 11th inst. there wras such a heavy fog on the Adriatic that the Trieste steamer to Venioe got on the Lido. Although on shore two hours, the vessel wvas not damaged. RUISSIA. (FROM OuR BEsRLN CORRnxSPONaET.) BERLIN, Dec. 15. According to the last advices we have received from Russia, the Imperial Family was to remove into St. Petersburg, from Czarskoje-selo, on the 8th inst., St. George's Day, according to the Russian calendar, but we have no information as yet that this removal of the Court has actually taken place. rrhe Dowager Empress has, however, taken up her residence in the WVinter P;alace ever since the close of last month, and aU accounts of her health agree In stating it to have been materially benefitted by her recent visits to Germany, and the course of mineral waters she has there gone through. The removal of the Court to the capital is always looked on as the commencement of the winter season, socially speaking. As regards the winter with reference to temperature, &c., it must be admitted that it had begun as far back as the 26th of November, when the ice began to show itself in masses on the Neva, and the communication with Cronstadt was broken off. The sudden return of winter in all its usual severity, after so unusually long and genial a summer, bas produced in St. Petersburg, - by all accounts, as general an epidenauc in the shape of the grippe as it has here. In Berlin cer-tain trials even were obliged tobe postponed from the circumstance that out of 24 jurymen summoned more than 12 were prevented being impanelled by being already QQDiAed to their beds. Tn Russia the course of justice has not been impeded from this reason, not because the y?pMpe has not been as bad there as here, but because they have no trial by jury. On the last Sunday in November a ceremony of unusual solemnity was performed in the Isaac's Cathedral, of which Alexander, the principal of the Solovetzki Monastery in Archangel, who is described as having " held it out against the English fleet" in I 1854, was the hero. The ceremony was the Ohirotonic, or the imposition of hands, which was performed by Archbishop Gregor, Metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Novogorod, assisted by all the archbishops and bishops now present in St. Petersburg on account of the Holy Synod. The former principal of the Solovetzki Monastery is now Bishop of Archangel and Cholenogar. In the year 1862 the thousandth anniversary of the foundation of the Russian monarchy is to be celebrated with great pomp and national manifestation in Russia. One grand feature in these solemnities is to be the inauguration of a monument commemorative of the day, but which has as yet to be designed, but for which subscriptions are being opened throughout the empire by order of the Government. The Emperor has only very lately decided finally that the said nmonument shall be erected at Novogorod, in the centre of the Kremlin there, not far from the Sophia CathedraL The destination wherethe said monument should be erected wasforalong time dubious, iuasmuch as the resolution had been adopted that its site should be the birthplace of the Russian Empire, and nobody knew exactly where that was. It has been however assumed of late, that the earliest domicile of the Warager Princes was in the outskirts of Novogorod; but, as this would be rather an out-of-the-way place for a national monument, the Emperor has decided on its being erected in the very centre of the Novogorod Kre mlin. The Emperor has lately caused his thanks to be publicly expressed to Mrs. Biddulph, the wife of an English Lieutenant-Colonel of that name, for the reteen of a certain picture of a saint, which her husband had come into possession of at the taking of Sebastopol. Mrs. Biddulph's father is captain in the Balaklava Battalion Stamousti in the Russian service. Since the return of the Emperor to his own dominions a numnber of sentences of courts-marcial lhave been published, which had been held for the most part on account of embezzlements committed during the late war. One of these cases, that of an officer of the commissariat in the 1st army, named Tselet&lki (Cirlecki), is remarkable for its large proportions; this individual had abscondedc with no less a sum than 200,000 silver roubles, and got off safely into foreign parts; his brother Sebastian, however, has been condemned to the loss of all social rights and to 10 yeara' inprisonment with hard labour in a mine, because he was accessory to the crime, helped to distribute the money among their relations, assisted the culprit in his flight, and did not denounce him to the police. The papers contain now the full particulars of tae murder of Lieutenant-General Prince Gagarin, Governor-General of Kutais, by Prince Dadeschkalian, a captain in the Guard. It appears that the latter had been summoned to the presence of the former on November 1, and there taken to task for the murder of his brother, wbich he had only recently committed; during the high words that ensued the Georgian Prince, who, like most of his countrymen, was in the habit of going about armed to the teeth, and of leading a lawless life, drew a pistol, on which an cviployg, and friend of the Governor's, rushed in on him and met his death at the hands of the Georgian, who turned his pistol on him and fired. He then fell upon Prince Gagarin with his yataghan and stabbed him three times; the sentry, who had been alarmed by the report of the pistol and the noise, endeavoured to interpose, but was wounded by the infuriated Prince, who got off to his own dwelling. With the assistance of two of his followers he defended himself in lis house against the military who were sent to apprehend him, wounded several (one of them apparently mortally, as an Ensign Ardischwlll is also mnentioned among his victims), and was evenhzally taken, after having been pinned to the wall by a thrust frora a soldier's bayonet. Prince BariatinBki, the governor, had the Mingrelian chief tried by a court-martial, which condemned him to be shot in Kutais. This sentence has been since executed. Prince Gagarin lingered in great suffering for five days, when he expired, greatly lamented; he had been wounded at the storming Of Kars, and in consequence of his wounds, which for a long time were supposed to be mortal, he had been compelled to inactivity for abouit a year, and it was only in last February that he was able to resume his administrative and military functions. He was buried November 9 in a chaDel of which he had himself laid the foundation-stone. The Grand Duke Nicholas, after being present at the reception of the Emperor and Empress at Kiew, on the 9th of October, set off for the Crimea, from which we hear that he arrived at Sebastopol, rid Sipheropo], on the 20t;h of November. The Arch. bishop Dimiter had preceded him thither, from Odessa, for the purpose of consecrating the chapel that has been built there inl honour of those that fell in the defence of that fortress. The Grand Duke, who is chef of the entire engineer corps of the Empire, carefully inspected the remains of the former fortrees on the south side of the town, after having previously visited the Paul Port at Kertch, the fortress at Yenikale, and reconnoitred " the ground on which a new fortress is to be built." Where that ground lies is not specified. The American brig Silver Rays, having on board the engineers and rnachinery that were to have been employed in the raising of the vessels sunk in the harbour of Sebastopol, has returned to Constantinople. 'The said vessels are reported by the divers to be so thoroughly buried in mud and earth that any raising of them is out of the question, the difficulties and the expense of doing so being estimated to exceed the probable proceeds of the salvage. ITALY. (raom o U OWN ConunsPolIDXs-r.) TURIN, DEC. 14. Turin is an early-rising capital. No matter at what hour of the morning one extracts himself from his blankets and descends into the street, vainly imagining that he will be the first afoot, he is sure to find that others are before him. Get up by candlelight, and w alk out shivering In the first gray grlimmering, and you find people abroad, pacing the streets and porticoes, as though they had all had to get up to see a dear friend off by a mid-nocturnal railway, or as if to sniff the very first breath of morning wvere their only chance of an appetite for breakfast. The day begins betimes in Turifi. People rise early and dine early, theatres are over and the streets empty at an hour when the fast population of London and Paris may be said to be beginning the evening. His Majesty Victor Emmanuel II. is no lie-abed, for half-past 10 a.m. was the hour fixed for his entrance into the Palazzo Madama-the Irreg;lar but picturesque building which occupies the centre of the great square of thfe Castello-for the purpose of delivering the Royal speech and opening the National Parliament of 1857. The morning was sharp enough. In popular belief ltalian winters are about equal to English summers, but in such an estimate Piedmont, or at least its capital, must be excepted. True it is, that last week, at Genoa, people were breakfasting out of doors in the shade of orange trees laden with ripe fruit; but the shadow we here enjoy is that of the snow-covered Alps, and the degree of cold we may expect before spring again gladdens us with its blossoms is not far inferior to that which, two years ago, made our troops in the Crimea heartily rejoice in their furred coats and well-closed huts. For some days past we have had sharp and steady frost, softened during the mid-day hours by warm sunbeams. Each succeeding morning has been colder, and this the National Guard doubtless perceived when it turned out to-day for its early parade. The bright musket barrels looked extremely chilly, and, patriotism apart, it is not improbable that many a gallant citizen soldier would have preferred his hot chocolate in the warm cafe to his cool standing on the stones of the square. This is no sneer, however, at the Turin Nationals, who form one of the most efficient-looking bodies of burgher troops I have ever seen. The doors of the Senate-house, as soon as opened, were besieged by applicants for admission to the various gallerles, a large portion of which (and the most convenient) was set apart for ladies. Of the male spectators, the best placed were those who went into the public galleries, the reserved one being behind the throne and altogether the wvrst position in the Chamber, Qa the occasion of the opening of the Parliament Senators and Deputies all sit together, muingled, and without any particular order. Before 10 o'clock they began to flock in, and numerous groups assembled on the floor of the House, vwhile the benches rapidly filled. On the right were at me priests in their clerical costume, seated on the same linewithoount SolarodellaMargherita. Deputies and Senators were black-coated and white-eravatted except a few military men, who were in uniform, and the Alinisters, who also wore their official dress. The tall martial figure of General della Mar. mora, his breast covered with Crimean and other bonours, was conspicuous; the late Mlinister of Pable Works, the blind and aged Signor Paleocaps, came in leaning on the arm of his successor. The diplomatic corps was, as usual, dazzling with embroideries. Punctuality, the politeness of kings, is one of the numerous good qualities of him of Sardinia. A few minutes before the half-hour the roll of drums announced that the Royal coffege was issuing from the Palace, which occupies part of one side of the square in which the Senate-house stands. The Ministers, the Presidents of the Senate and Lower House, and a Deputation from the Chambers, went down stairs to receive His Majesty, and loud shouts of Viva iv Re ! were heard. On his entrance into the spacious and stately but gloomy hail in which the Senate holds its sittings every one stood up, and from every side and every corner of the crowded gaUeries and benches there arose a longcontinued shout of hearty welcome and real goodwill to the Sovereign, whose honesty and patriotism have rendered him one of the most popular now living. There was no dlaque there, no salaried clappers of hands, or police agents with orders to enact enthusiasm, but it was a real bo?0 fJle expression of the popular feeling. The King seated himself on the chair of state, and the MAinister of the Interior proceeded to administer the oath to the new Deputies. First reading over the form of the oath, he called an alphabetical roll of the Chamber, and every Deputy present, on his name being pronounced, extended his right hand and said Lo giuro ("I swear it"). The Deputies musterod strong, and the names to -which no response was made were few. This ceremony over, the uing, in a firm distinct voice, read the Royal sDeech. It ran as follows:- " Signori Senatorl, Signori Deputati, "On finding myEelf in the midst of you after the recent elections, it is pleasing to me to manifest to you the confidence that the new Legislature will fulfil its high misdion with patriotism and sense equal to that of which proof was given by the Legislature that has completed its duties. I doubt not that I shal find in you the same strong and loyal co-operation in applying and developing those iberal principles on which repose now, in an immovable mnanner, our national policy. (His Majesty pronounced these words with emphasis, and they produced the most lively impression on his auditory. For a full minute the Chamber rang with applause and with cries of " Viva ia " Our relations with foreign Powers continue regular and satisfactory. " The interruption of diplomatic relations with a neigh. bouring State, arising from causes which 3urope has been able to appreciato, still subsists; this, however, has not been an obstacle to the usual civil and commercial intercourse between the two countries. " I have ordered my Government to communicate to you new treaties concluded in the interests of public justice, of L,avigation, and of commerce, with Spain, Denma-lr, and Persia. "T The increase of our commercial interests in foreign countries has rendered indispensable a better arrangement of the consular service. A project will be submitted to you with a view to that important reform. My MInisters will also present to you various projects on important matters of internal administration. "It will be possible, thanks to a rigorous economy, to maintain in the budget an equilibrium between the revenue and the ordinary expenses, notwithstanding the unfavourable events which have opposed the regular development of the resources of the State. It will ke proper, nevertheless, to have recourse to credit to provide for the great works commenced from Spezzla to Mont Cenis for the defence of the State, and for the advantage and honour of the nation. (Marks of approbation and applause.) " Signori Senatori, Signori Deputati, "Ten years have now passed since my augnst fatber, sunmmoning his people to liberty, gave them the Statato (Constitution). Inspiring my whole life with that mag nanimons act, I have devoted all my strength to rende fruitful the thought that dictated it to him. (The King was here interrupted by the most enthusiastic applause.) "May his memory, which to-day, symbolized in marble I confide to your veneration, Inspire all your deliberations for the good and for the glory of Pledmont, and of our common Italian country !" The termination of the speech was the signal for the renewal of those acclamations which had already burst forth on three occasions during its delivery. The AMinister of the Interior declared the session of 1857-8 to have commenced. The King left the Chamber amid continued applause of the heartiest kind, which, taken up by the throng in the vestibule, on the staircase, and out of doors, continued until he re-entered hispalace. I observed, bowever, a number of deputies on the right who took no share in it, and doubtless they did not feel well pleased at the Eing's declaration of adherence to the Liberal principles he has always upheld-a declaration which, although fully anticipated, has not the less given great satisfaction to the Liberals. Victor Ermmanuel was accompanied by his Royal Higlness the Prince of Carignano and a briliant staff. The young Prince of Piedmont and Duke of Aosta were in a tribune on the left of the throne. The statue of Charles Albert, which, as I lately told you, has been presented by the King to the National Parliament, and placed in the vestibule of the Senate, was covered when I entered the hall; but the covering was removed by the King himself on his arrival, and on going out the figure attacted much attention. It Is of white marble, ably' executed by Cevasco. Judging by the best portraits extant of the deceased Monarch, the likeness is very good. It was impossible to look withotut a melancholy interest at the efligy of the benevolent, well-meaning Sovereign, the true friend of the people he ruled, whose decision of character was not equal to his personal valour and excellent intentions, but whose memory ought to be, and I believe is, held in affectionate respect by every Sardinian Liberal. 1 have omitted to mention in its proper place, that at the preparatory sitting of the Chamber of Deputies, held yesterday to draw by lot the commission that was to receive the King to-day, 9 out of 11 persons drawn were Liberals, which that party accepts as of good omen. The Provisional Bureau of the Chambers was at the same time constituted. General Quaglia is President by right of age, one older deputy having declined the honour. The four youngest deputies, Signori Leardi, Alficri, Verasis, and (Gallini, are temporary secretaries. After the opening of the Parliament, the Ohambers held a short sitting for the transaction of preliminary business, and then adjourned, probably until the day after to-morrow.
T2H TREATMENT OF GOVERNA8SES IN PFANCE AND IN ENGLAND. TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TMIES. Sir,-PubliG attention having been called to the recent lamentable death of a yontg French lady in this town, I think it desirable to state that a very similar case occurred here about four months since, but in that case the sufferer was a young Englishwoman, aged 22, who had been in the service of a French lady of rank, residing in the Faubourg St. Germain, at Paris. On the arrival of the evening train from Paris she was found in one of the carriages in a state of delirium, which, on her being removed to an hotel and medieal aid called in, was found to arise from malignant typhus. It was only by means of her passport and a few incoheront words that her name and that of her native place were elicited. I attended her until her death, but never could obtain from her a single intelligible roply. She proved to be of very respectable family, end had with her a considerable sum of money for a person in her condition of life, for the security of which no precautions had been taken. Her brother, a respectable tradesman at H-, in Suffolk, was able to arrive only In tinie to foilow her to the grave. There can be no doubt whatever that she must have been In a terrible condition of fever when she was put into the railway carriage. I have eommunicated these facts because there seems, I think, to be a disposition ina some quarters to put an unjust construetion on the late most deplorable occurrenee. Inhumamitv is, unhappily, peculiar to no one country or nation. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, AN MNGLISH CRA-PLAIT. Bo-0ogne.sur-Mer, Dec. 15. SoTHArmp'ToN DocxE ComPAXY.-The directors have, we anderstand, decided on declaring a dividend for the curent l.f-ear at the rate of 4 per cent, per anugn.
THAR CITY os- U4VAT,zgr1 1PAPER. (From Dickens's Hozuehodk Worsg,) Within a certain circle, of which the Royal Exchango is the centre, lie tho rains of a great paper city. Its rulerssolid and substantial as they appear to the eye-are made of paper. They ride in paper carriages; they marry paper wives, and unto them are born paper children; their food is paper, their thoughts are paper, and aU they touch is transformed to paper. They buy paper and they sell paper; they borrow paper and they lend paper-a paper that shrinkl and withers in the grasp like the leaves of the sensitive plant; and the stately-looking palaces in which they live and trado are built of paper-smaU oblong pieces of paper, which, like the cardboard houses of our childhood, fall with a single breath. That breath has overtaken them, and they lie in the dust. Let me collect the scattered pieces, and build them up into such another variety of trembling struc. tures as they forrqed before; as they form now ; or as, in a few years, they will undoubtedly form again. Oar fIrst paper house is the firm of Collaps, Vortex, Docket, and Co., general merchauts. It Is quiet arnd unobtrusive ln appearance, being in Tobacco-lane, Fenchaurch. street; and its small office has not had its windows cleaned for 30 years, which gives it a favourable appearance of solidity. The leading peculiarity of this firm is ramifica. tlorn; and it is resuarkable for the harmony and beauty of its complex machinery. The senier partner, Mr. CoUaps is a merchant of the old school. Thero is a fund of credit int his shoe-backles, and in the heavy yellow fausily coach that coaues to fetch him of an afternoon. Mr. Vortex affects an almost Qaskerish severlty of attire; he attends to the dis. counting department, and the chairmanships and directorRFips of those im portaht and choice public companies which he tinds so useful in consolidating the credit of the honse. Mr. Docket is a copy of Ur. Vortex, some 15 years younger; he attends to the working partof the business, whatever that maybe; superintends the clerks, answers troublesome inoui. ries, and is supposedto buy and sell all themerchandise. 'The ramifications of the house extend to most cities of importance in England, abroad, and the colonies. In Glasgow there is the branch firm of M'Vortem and Co., who have established friendly relations with all the leading banks, and whose paper, drawn noon the sabstantial firm of O'Docket and Co., of Dublin, is ' done" without a whisper at the minimum rate. The substantial firm of O'Docket and Co. of Dublin enjoys the highest credit that can be obtained by a long course of regular trading in the land of generous sympathies and impulsive genius ; and their paper, upon the highly respectable firm of M'Vortex and Co., of Glasgow, is mnuch in demand, at very low ratez of discount indeed. Then there is Alphonse Collaps and Co., of Paris; the great house of Collaps Brothers, at Calcutta; Vortex, Collaps, and Docket, of San Franciseo ; Docket, Brothers, and Collaps, of New York; Collaps,ColJaps, and Co., of the Cape of Good Hope - Vortex, Docket, and Vortex, of Melbourne, Australia: and Vortex, Brothers, and Docket, of iMontreal, Canada. These all draw and feed upon each other as their necessities require; and the parent firm of Collaps, Vortex, Docket, and Co., of Tobacco-lane, London, watches over its obedient children with a more than fatherly interest, and trades upon their acceptances to the extent of millions. Formerly the great London bon e used to stop payment during every commercialpanic, their credit preventing the necessity of their doing so at any other time. Now, they have grown too wise and important to do that. It is not that their trade has become in any degree sounder or more legitimate, but the accumulated liabilities of many yearshave swelled their transactions into such gigantic proportions that the mere whisper of any difficulty to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England causes a representation to be made to our paternal Government, whose mission it is to foster, protect, and accommodate trade; and it is agreed that sach a public calamity as the suspension of Messrs. Collaps, Vortex, Docket, and Co. must bo prevented as any cost. It is prevented by the suspension of the Bank Charter Act instead; an extra issue of Bank of Eugland notes is authorized, with a Government guarantee in case there should not be gold to exchange for them ; and comtnerce-ill-used commerce-breathes again. My next house is the firm of Messrs. Ignes, Fatul, and Co., the extensive and eccentric shtppers, of Skye Chambers. Old Broad-street, who are alwaya on the search for new markets, and who have very peculiar notions of the requirements of distant countries. They are constantly send. ing large cargoes of damask tablecloths and silver toothpicks to the Sandwich Islands, or-niolu clocks to Tierra del Fuego ; and pianos, articles of vertu, and Birmingham idols to the southern coast of Africa. They import, in return, for the London market, tomahawks, heathen gods and goddesses carved out of stamps of trees, with occasionally a Holy Family, painted by sonme inteiligent native Raffaelle of Mozambique, in which the mother and child, with very thick lips and sableskins, are evidently doing well. Messrs. Ignes, Fatui, and Co. are not so particular as they might be about the natcre of their shipments, because they findgreat facilities in obtaining loans upon paper, called bills of lading -a system of pawning ships' cargoes-and if the goods should be returned unsaleable a ear ence, injured by time, sea water, and with the accumulated charges of freight and interest upon tbeir backs, what matter ? The loan has supphled funds to send out other and equally well-assorted cargoes; so that, as fast as one payment falls due another loan is obtained. and the whole system is kept up like the brass balls which the juggler tosses in the air. Whenever a vessel is lost without being properly insured,-whenever an Australian mail brings intelligence that heaps of costly rubbish are rotting on the wet glutted wharves of Melhourne,-we may guess in a moment that bothbthe vessel and the goods are the property of hessrs. Ignes, Fatni, and Co., and look for a suspension of the firm that will set all things right, and furnish gossip for the money-market for about four-and-twenty hours.d Another well-known paper house is the house of Strawboy and Rag, the Xanchester varehousemen, of Fustianlane, Wood-street. Strawboy had been a buyer in a large city establishment, where he learned to regard returns as of more importance than either the quality of the business done or the profits derived from it. Strawboy therefore went iX for large returns. Rag had been chief clerk in the same establishment; and finding, after deeply studying the theory of trade, that the accommodation bill entered so largely into every transaction, he had come at last to regard it-like some eminent financiers do the inconvertible bank-note-as the basis of all wealth, and had started the extensive business of Strawboy and Rag, with nothing but his own ingenuity, Strawboy's broad chest, doublebreasted waistcoat, and reputed energy, and a pile of billstamps of all d.nominations. Mr. Rags calculations were based upon a k-nowledge of how many small traders in the outsklrts of London, in London itself, and throughout the country, were maintaining a position that was not required by the existing demands of trade, or that they were not qualified to fill, either by ability or capital. It was with theese small over-traders that Messrs. Strawboy and Rag opened negotiations, and, in consideration of reviving their languishing credit, founded about 120 drawingposts or bill stations, with power to manufacture hills upon them to an unliimited extent. The demands of such a business of course con.umed whole mountains of goods, and the manufacturers were dellglsted; the discounts fc such a business of course required whole mines of money, and the bankers were delighted. Strawboy-who always affected a rough, hearty character-used to refer with price at public dicners to the excessive lowress of his origin. He worked in a brickfield when a boy for 2d. a-day, and he dated his prosperity from the time when he became an errand boy and drudge in a city warehouse at half-a-crowna-week. Mr. Rag was more reserved-the gentleman of the firm-and ho puts his views upon the curreney in the shape of a pamphlet. called ,Is nmncuy to b thc Ifast,- or the Slarc of tfe Peoslec " It is a pity tbh-t such a promising state of things was not destined to endure. The crash came at last ; and although they very nearly Persuaded the Nationai Bank to render them assistance, hlessrs. Strawboy and Rag were obliged to submit to the fall. 'Tlhe next house that rises before me is that of Messrs. Bibb and Tucker, of Consol-Court, Threadneedle-street. It is not easy to sav what the exact business of Messrs. Bibb and Tucker is. I have known and watched them for many years, and I profess myself totally unable to form an opinion, unless I decide that they are merchants who exist for the purpose of failtng ev-ery three years, under circumstances that command the general sysiipathy of their creditors. Bibb is a man who givf-s yoou the impression of being a remarkably sinple and strAightforward man; in fact, so general is this impression, that he is known in the money-market as honest George Bibb." Tucker is a man who, according to his own account, if his inclinations has been consulted, would rather-have been in the church; but, as his father desired to see him enrolled in the ranks of commerce, he obeyed his fatlser and took his place among the merchants of the city, where he hopes he always endeavours to do his duty. When the periodical failures of B3ibb and Tucker take place there is generally, for such apparently quiet people, a rather large amiount of debts, and a very large amount of liabilities; hut, althouga a considerable quantity of property is always unaccountably sucked up, the dividend proposed never falls below 12s. 3d. in the pound, and as their transactions are always rigidly confined to creditors who belong to the old-fashioned class of merchants, who look unoon a man's word as his bond,-and a very good bond too -there is never any scrutiny demanded or any troublesome question asked, and the very respectable dividend always carries them throush triumphantly, with the presentation of a piece of plate. Once-and once only-they broke the uniformity of their composition by paying 11s. in tbe pound, but they restored the balance the next timo by increasing the dividend to 14s. The next house Is the well-known manufacturing house of Lacker, Crane, and Co., of Packingease-yard, Lower Thames-street, and Dnpmist-mills, near Old Rutsudrum, Inverness-shire. The premises in Packingoase-yard are modest enough, and would not seem to indicate a business of a very extensive character; but in this instance the art of the engraver is called in, and we are presented upon the invoices and bUIl stauips with a flatterng and highly suggestive view of the Important and basy Dunmist Mills, of which the smaU office in London Is only one of the numerous agencies. There are water-power and steam-power, high chinsneys sending forth volumes of smoke, long ranges of outbuildings, with groups of busy workpeople, and large solid hales of merohandise ; bridges and tramways, and waggons loaded with raw material, drawn by struggling horses of the Flemish breed towards the crowded gates of thts industrial settlement. The whole is a work of imagination of the highest order, alike creditable to the designer and the engraver. When, In the usual course of things, the house of Lacker, Crane, and Co. is compelled to call its creditors together, and an inspeCtion of the maguifcent factory, outworks, and plant takes place by the ordes of the assignees, the dissolving view of the industrial hive, with its active workpeople and its din and clatter of machinery, gzaduaUy recedes, and in Its place stands sAhe pastoral simpllcity of F. couple of barns and a kllted 51.ephmerd tendiatg his flocks. My next p aper-hoR,st le that of Baggs and Co., of Nabobbuildings, 1 ee.d,nhaf Isteet, in the East Indian trade. Baggs and Co. v;oas;d bassban )e9: .nusercially defuncet many years Isince ,t.' Ic.- a .- nsinua.te occsrerce-they were joined L atth U l: r*;, th~c os; >.n Df 0lie great East Indian director of that name. The firm of Ca-rY, Biggs, and Co. wa8 a very different concern from the languls.ting frm of Baggg and Co. Its credit was good to any ax5OInt, for many persons confounded the name of Cony wit!h old Cnrry, and they did not stay to undeceive themselveg. Others spoke about the great wealth of old Curry-wealth that he must have; spoke about young Curry being the only son and a great favourite-a very great favourite; spoke about the praiseworthy care of a father desirout of, seeing his sO oon mfortably settled in commerce before he, finally retired from the busy scene. Old Baggg made hay wbile the sun shone. One morning old Carry committed suioide. Upon iniquiry it was found that he was not only very much behind the world, but that he had a large number of forged biUls in the hands of Longpaper and Co., who rather prefer that exceptional branch of the trade In paper, becnuse they have fouud, from alongexperience, that forged documents, as a rnle, while they yield the highest rate of interest, furnish the greatest amount of security. Youn, Curry, instead of taking any capital into the tottering firm, had, on the contrary, drawn a few thousands out of it as a, premium for the use of his valuable financial namne. * * My next house is compounded of the Etna and Vesavins Joint-stock Bank, Filch-lane, London, and the great builders and contractors. l1essrs. Chaos, Rotbill, and Clay, of Bankside. Mr. M'Vacuutn, who was installed as solo maDager of the Etna and Vesuvius Bank,with an enormous salary, is one of those extraordinary men which the city creates-men of wide experience, large grasp of intellect,and great decision of character. As a proof of his great infiuence in the city, ard the respect which was paid to him by the commercial commanity, before the doors had been opened for business two months the bank numbered among its clients the names of ME ssrs. Collaps, Vortex and Docket; Ignes, Fatni, and Co.; Strawboy and Ra; Bibb and Tucicar ; Lacker, Crane, and Co.; Curry and Baggs-and, greater even still, the leviathan house of Chaos, Rotbill, and Clay. Mt'Vacuum being a man of a discerning mind, soon discovered the peculiar ability of the latter firm, and the result was an arrangement by which, in consideration of M'Vacunuw granting the use of the bank for unlimited facilities, ,Messrs. Chaos, Rotbill, and Clay, were to begin the well-known building settlementof New Bsbylonia, granting M'Vacu'sm a great share in the profits, Suddenly the great marsh of East Babel sprang into life. Suddenly upon the dismal swamp arose the plan of Newv Baby. lonia. Suddenly shoals of bills of exchange appeared in the money-market-*nd especialy in the accounts of the Etna and Vesuvius Bank-drawn upon hodmen, carpenters, bricklayers, carters, and labourers, whose names became as familiar to caPitalists as those of Mlessrs. Fossil, Ingot, and Bagstock themnselves. Suddenly came the general crash, and paralyzed enterprize left New Babylonia-thae hideous nightmare-the paper monster-which it remains at the present time. There are the long streets of carcasses, vith awfulgulfs and pitfalls of cellars; there Is the outline of a grand square filled with heaps of gravel, rubbish, old broken bricks, pieces of iron, and slabs of paving stone half hidden in tho yielding clay; there are large rafters of timber, round which the long damp grass has grown; and there is a deep pool of rain water in which float rotten planks that venturesome nrchins have formed into a raft; there Is thefragment of a chatrch, and a frontage that might have been intended for a chapel or a literary institution; there are large ghastly shells of mansions, some wlth broken, weather-beaten stucco fronts, some with ruined porticoes half completed, some with clondcapped garret window holes staring far away across the mnisty country; and there are frameworks of shop3 through which the distant fields are seen as in a picture. It is the home Of the rag-picker and the tramp, silent and awful as a city of the dead-silent as the grave of sunken capiW should be-silent and undisturbed as when, in the niddie of a summer's day, .3,CO workmen streamed slowly from the place never to return.
TVHE JEUFOSSE TRIAL. (F'rom CaW'vj,ani's .Xfessensger.) The Court of As.izes of the Eare yesterday morning proceeded with this case, and received evidence in support of the indicttnent agtinst Madame de Jeufosse, her two sons, and their gamekeeper, Crepel, on the charge of havInI intentionally caused the death of AL Gnillot in the grounds of the Chateau of Jeufosse. A medical man described the nature of the wounds which the deceased had received, and another, Dr. Cune, his regular physidan, who had happened to meet his (Gdillot's) servant just after the death had taken place, said that ou speaking to Madame de Jeufosse on the melancholy affair she had expressed herself in a manner which proved that she thought herself justified in causing any man who entered her grounds at night to be fired7at. Gros, servant to GuiUot, deposed that he had often accompanied his master in his nocturnal visits to the grounds, and he thought that the objectof them 'was to deposit letters 'or some one in the chateau . He had noticed wben serving at table, and on other occasions, that glances of intelligence vwere exchanged between his master and Mademoiselle Laurence (the governess), and he had once seen her press his hand. He described the shooting of his master, as related in the indictment, and he declared that though the servants of the chateau had seen his master writhg in agony on the ground they had offered no assistance. The coachman and other servants of the chateau deposed to the manner in which GuiUot had annoyed the ladies, by throwing himself In their way in their 'walks and drives, and by penetrating into the grounds at night; They also said that some days before the death of Guillot some oue had entered the apartments of the chateau, upset the furniture, and put mud on a portrait of the hteband of Madame do Jenfosse; and they asserted, in contradiction to Gros, that they had gone to Gullot after he bad been shot, and had even given hitm a glass of water, which was all he had asked for. A man named Corbeau, formerly gardener to Madame de Jeufosse, said that that lady having in the winter perceived that somo one entered her grounds at night had told him to watch with a gan, but only to charge his gun with salt. This man was asked if he had not stated to several persons that Mtadame de Jeufosse had offered bim 50f. to fire at GudUot not merely with salt, but with shot. He denied that he had done so, but he was positively contradicted on the point by several witnesses. One of them even said that on hearlng that Guillot had been killed he exclaimed, "Well, I am glad it is Crepel who did the job, and not I! If I had dose it I should now be in an awkward position !" After a commissary of police, a captain of gendarmery, and other witnesses had deposed to various circumStances mentioned in the indictmont, Mademoiselle Laurence Thouzery, the governess, was called. Her appearance excited great curiosity, but she did not seem to be at aU troubled at it; she I not remarkable for good looks, and has a strong Norman accent. She Paid that after the acquaintance between the De Jeufosses and the Guiots commenced GleUot was constantly paying compliments and trying to speak to her in secret, but she had always repeUed him and had told Madame de Jeufoase of his conduct. " Did you never reoly to what be said P" asked the President. " Oh ! never, Sir." " Did you never let him press your hand, or did you never press his?' " Oh, never." II Did you notice that he afterwards paid attention to Mademoiselle Blanche de Jeufosse?" "I sawthathe acted towards Mademoiselle Blanoheas heacted towards me, but, ofeoarse, she treated him as I did. She repelled all his advances. Yet he was not content with annoying us, but tried to compromise as." " You say positively that Mademoiselle Bance repelled his advances 7" "Without any manner o£ doubt !" "Yet you knew that he came into the grounds at night?" "All of us in the chateau knew that some one came, but we did not know that it was he." ' Did you not know that the person, whoever it was, brought letters ?" "No." "Did you not once tell Madame de Jeafosse that you had heard some one talking with MademoiseUe Blanche in her chamber?'" I said that I thought I had heard some one, and that I feared it was Guillot, who was so very impudent. But I knew that Mademoiselle Blanche was incapable of giving him any encouragement, and besides it was not in her chamber, bat in that of her brother Ernest, that I heard the voices; in fact, she had not a chamber to herself." The witness was then asked If something improper had not taken place between her and a young man who had resided with the curc of St. Aubin, but she denied it. She was also asked if she had not said to the gamekeeper, "Kill aU black animals," knowing that the " black man" was the designation given by the servants of the chateau to Gutliot and sbe answvered that she did not remember. AL Odeard Dallaze, a retired officer, deposed that GutUot had spoken in a scandalous way of Mademoiselle Laurence, and had used insulting language as to Madame Jenfosse; and that he (witness) threatened to caU him to account for so doing. He saiaL that GaiUlot had solemnly protested that it was not he who had entered the grounds, and had recommended that the person who did so should be fired at. He added that Madame Guillot ha6d once told him that bsr husband bad seduced the daughter of a gamekeeper, and wanted to bring her to reside in their ho'tse. On this Madame Guilot exclaimed with eniotion, "'What you say is horrible !" " Say so, if you please," answered the witness, "the truth is alwn;ys horrible to those whose interest it is not to hear it !" '- What you say is an infaisious falsehood I" cried Madame Guiot. The witness then said that he himself had consulted a gentleman who had represented himself to be the examining magistrate of Louviers as to what could be done with a personx who entered private grounds at night, and that this magistrate bad said that he might be shot at. " It Is possible, cowever, ' eontinued the witness, " that he may have added the words, ' if he be a malefactor."' "L Tripet, formerly vice-consul of France at Moscow deposed that GuiUot had spoken In a shameful way both of MademoiseUe Laurence and of Mademoiselle Blanche, and thata rupture between him and the De Jeufosses had taken place in conseqr,ence. Witness admitted that he had odvised Madame de Jeuafosse to dismitss MademoiseUe Laurence because her n anner with men was too bold, and because he had observed what appeared to himn to be too much familiarity between her and GuilUot; but that lady had refused, saying that she had motives for keeping her: As be did not know what the reasons were, he had asked Guillot if he knew them, and that person had answered that there were two,-one which he did not believe and the other which he would never tell. The witness said that it was he who had announced to Madame GuiUot the death of hor husband; the poor woman. was distracted, and cried loudly for vengeauce; vwhen, however, she became calmer, she said that she did not thick It was Mademoielle Blanchu her husband had gone after as he had always spoken of that youg lady with respect. 1ef orG he went to Madame GuiiUot wvitness had been at the chateat of Jeufosse, and had suggested thet it was not right to leave the dead body of Guillot on the ground; that lady had acswered " Act a s if you were in your own house "' and he tent out a sheet to cover it, until the arrival of ths authorities; the tdea of putting It on a mattress ha not occuzrsed to him. Eye added that sInce the event iho had learnt that Guot had spoken ofs Madeimolselle BlaXnhe at a club at Gailon inisuch scandalouls terms that hboould not help consideriag him a scoundrel. M. Pauil GniUot, brother of the deceased, produced the letter which Ernest de Jeufoase had written to his brother, warning him that he (Ernest) had given orders to ' fire at the "hosts' which visited the grounads of the chateau, the said'}etter having been intercepted anid kept back by MIadame Qulijiot. At tl,is sbage of the ease the Court adjourned.

LONDON, FRIDAY, DBCBMBLBR 18, 1&57, To plant Christianity in such a oluntry as India is indeed a task worthy of a great nation. India is, as regards its creeds, the epitome of Asia. Here are gathered together races 'which cling to all the superstitions which are scattered through the Eastern Hemisphere. In the countries within and without the Ganges, which are more or less subject to British power, are to be found the Mahomedan, the follower of BRAHMA, the Buddhist, the Parsee, and the Sikh. And this great community of races is under British sway, and must receive its future impulses from British civilization. Who can wonder, then, that at this time, when men's minds have been roused by a great disaster, when the flame of patriotism burns brighter and stronger than perhaps at any period of our history, and the sense of a moral responsibility peouliarly affects us, not only religious parties, but even the world, -the frivolous and unthinking world, as it is called -should debate how the principles which have elevated European nations, which have driven out those baser instlncts of heathen vengeance and heathen cruelty, can be made to take root among the populations which we are so proud to have subjected ? Such meetings as that which we reported yesterday are the natural result of the present exaltation on the subject. They may be expected to do good by keeping alive the spirit of which they are the evidence. But it rests with the nation at large whether the propagation of the Gospel in India shall be a form or a reality. A religious society can do little, even the rivalry of the Church and the Dissenting sects can do little to advance Christianity, unless the heart of the nation is in the work. A country like India must always be dependent on its Government, and the Government of India is the expression of England's national wilL The Propagation Society or the Church Missionary Society, the Scotch Presbyterians or the English Congregationalists, may send out zealous, instructed, courageous missionaries; bishoprics may be established and the Anglican hierarchy augmented by right rev. prelates taking their titles from Agra or Lahore, Nagpore or Tinnevelly. Colleges may be established to teach English students the dogmas of the theologies they will have to attack, and to initiate Hindoo neophytes into the mysteries of the Christian faith; bu we are afraid that unless this individual or corporate zeal coincides with the general policy which the rulers of India have determined to follow, there will be little succems. There cannot be a doubt that up to the present time the policy of the Company's Government has been to discourage proselytism. We are far from doubting that an advocate of the Government might prove that many advantages have resulted from this policy. He might show that such a province was acquired, that such a Prince was won over, by a general confidence in our indifference to conversion. He might also point to the general tranquillity of India, and ask whether, if the Sepoys' pretended fears had been based on truth, we should only have had to contend with a mutiny, and not with a rebellion. But, whether right or wrong as a matter of policy, the fact is undeniable, and has hardly been denied. The Government of India has acted with more than the modesty of the Home Government in Malta, Corfu, and other places. It has abnegated not only the propagation, but even the confession, of its own religion. It has given no encouragement to the missionary, it has discountenanced either chaplains or laymen in its own service, when they have endeavoured to address the natives on spiritual subjects. But, as is generally the case, the policy founded on a basis of dissimulation has fallen to the ground. Every Mussulman and HIindoo knew that the Governmentwas acting on principles which all its members in their secret hearts knew to be wrong. These cunning and suspicious Asiatics would not credit our self-abasement. Englishmen were Christians, and Christianity was an aggremsive religion. The Government must, then, wish converts to be made, and their discouragement of YisMionary enterprise must be a trick. Bes,ides, how could the Compalny disapprove missions when they allowed them to enter the country ? Was not the Compauy absolute, and does not an absolute Govermment forbid that which it dislikes? Obviously, then, there must be some deep design under this appearance of favour for the native creeds. The Government was only waiting until it was strong enough, until it had conquered the whole country, and then it would forcibly convert them all. Who shall say that something like this was not the argument of the lIussulran plotters who appear to have roused the Sepoys to mutiny by the bold story ot the greased cartridges ? Better far would it have been if the Company's Government had from the beginning upheld its own religion in a manner which an Asiatic could. understand and respect than practiae a self-denial which it was out of their power to fathom. Into the means which the Church aud the various .eligious societies may use to advance the cause of Christianity it would be here out of place to enter. Doubtless the doctrines of Christianity must be preached in perfect sincerity, but when we see the names of the Bishop of LoNDoN and Mr. Justice CoI.EmrDG in a list of speakers we feel that there are men engaged in the cause who will understand the objections raised by most educated men to the proceedings of the common run of English missionaries. It is singular that this country, with its powerful ITniversities, with its yearly crop of highly-trained youths, with its facilities for studying the Oriental languages ancd philosophy, should be represented generally by a race of proselytizers so little educated for the work of assaulting the more elaborate systems of Paganism. The Hindoo, with his complex theology of incarnation and metamorphosis, with his divided godhead, his theories of asceticism and self-mortification, is too often approached as if he were a South Sea cannibal, without a knowledge of anything having the remotest analogy to Christian doctrine or ethics. The usual Scripture-reader, fresh from May meetings at home, full of the commonplaces of religious oratory, and knowing nothing more of the Bible he quotes than is to be gathered from such critics as Ilnny and Scorr, is hardly the man to tear to pieces the interwoven subtleties of so many ages. We would trust, then, that if the efficient preaching of Christianity be contemplated the direction, at least, will be committed to men who are strong enough for the work. But our chief hope is in the indirect effect of English knowledge and civilization. The extension of Christianity through the barbarian tribes of Europe was in no low degree the result of their conviction that Rome was superior to them in knowledge, and that therefore her god must be greater than their own. The very fear of conversion which seems to prevail throughout India is a proof that the Hindoo distrusts the vitality of his own faith. He has now seen that, though outnumbered a hundredfold, the Christian Englishman is his master. Soon we hope that the country will be intersected by telegraphs, railways, and canals; that schools will be increased, the use of the English language made general in the public service, the true prin- ciples of physical science expounded, and the I whole code of Christian morality enforced. Then we may trust that the doctrines of our faith will find an easier way. But it seems to us that these things are in the hands of the Government, and not of any section of soCiety, however enlightened or zealous. Let the Government determine to uphold Christianity as its own religion, and to forbid anything like an abnegation of its principles, and we have little doubt that the Asiatic will yield obedience in the end.
The history of civil punishment for the last quarter of a century goes to shon that it is dangerous refining on the subject of punishment. We have a broad natural idea of punishment, as involving pain of some kind or other, in the shape of restraint upon personal liberty, hard labour, rough diet, and the like. Pain is the natural punishment of crime, but pain is not necessarily a thing that crushes andprostrates a man; it does not necessarily deprive him of spirit or hope; nor, on the other hand, does it necesaarily goad or infuriate or brutalize him. There are many phenomena connected with such discipline which show quite the contrary of this, which show that it really operates as a wholesome treatment; it keeps a man in order, gives him plenty to do, protects him from a great deal of misery which he might be bringing on himself if he had his own way, and allows him, in most cases, a future to look forward to. DAUNTE describes the inmates of his Purgatory as neverslowly and tediously as they travel to their ultimate delivery-losing hope, but always feeling its latent stimulus. Punishment is not all punishment; it is a mixture, it is a composition, of which the general effect is discipline. It is a plain straightforward thing, whether it is the punishment of schoolboys or criminals ; it consists of certain well-known, downright measures, and uses those broad instruments of discipline which appeal to our common sense. But civil punishment has of late years been refined upon; it has been taken up by philosophers and theorists, who have twisted it into all kinds of curious shapes, curves and angles, like boys playing with guttapercha, which is in succension flattened and thickened, pinched and rounded, stretched and compressed. These men set to work with the best intentions, not aiming at rigour, but simply thinking that they saw deeper into the idea of punishment than other people did,-that they could make more of it, work the mine lower, and extract all sorts of precious ore which had not been dreamt of. They were busy speculative minds, ingenious, fertile in contrivances. They did not invent remarkable thumbscrews and pincers, though it seems their system has incidentaUy led to instruments not unlike these, because their animus was a benevolent philosophical one; but they aimed at new moral or metaphysical severities; they poked into the human interior, they discovered convenient tender places-vulgarly " raws"-in man's social nature, in his imaginative nature; they proceeded to work upon him through these avenues of discipline, they subjected him to solitary confinement, to solitude, with the addition of darkness, &c. The result, we think, shows that first thoughts are best on this subject, and that the natural idea of punishment is the truest one. The present discipline of our prisons is doubtless a great improvement upon that of the old, dirty, neglected prisons of GornsMmaT's, time, where all, men, women, and boys, were pub4*ogether into a courtyard to debase each other. The main basis of our new prison discipline is doubtless a great improvement, but our refinements have not worked particularly well. These curious and eccentric forms of punishment are quite different in their effect from the natural forms,-they have, in truth, the effect of tortures, they upset nature, they stultify, they inflriate, they touch a dark spring in the human machine which produces horrible disclosures and lets out a whole chaos of evil passions ; this key extracts by a miserable ingenuity all the brute, and leaves all the man behind; it is the fatal key to the door of the terrible chamber, and aU its revolting interior. Nobody could well knoa' bsforehand how these curious instruments would worlk, any more than they would know the effect of a new medicine or the power of a new engine. They were new applications altogether. Probably, for instance, these philosophers thought that solitude would give time for reflection, would subdue temper, would produce self-examination. Modified solitude is doubtless a wholesome discipline, as common facts show, but these men argued logically or metaphysically from the idea of solitude, as if it must by a law of nature produce certain effects, and go on producing them inde6nitely the mole the instrument was applied. These men did not, in short, know human nature, did not know what they were experimenting upon, and were therefore working in the dark with all their ingenuity. We do not know to what extent Dartmouth Prison has employed these new refinements of punishment, but there appears to be something wrong at work there, if wd are to judge from the extraordinary means of coercion which appear to Le necessary for keeping the convicts in order. At Exeter Asaizes, two or three days ago, a Dartmouthconvict was triedfor a brutal a3sault uponone of the warders, and the trial brings out the fact of a particular coercive instrument which appears to be in common use there. " I put upon him," says the warder, " a body belt, which is a covered chain, "to which are attached two handcuffs, in which "the prisoner's wrists are placed, giving him five "inches' play for his hands." Mr. Justice WmEs dleclares that he does not know anything about this instrunLent, that it is mentioned in no Act of Parliament, and he doubti at first whether, even with the sanction of the SECuETARY of STATE, it is a legal instrument of restraint. However, in summing up he retracts this doubt, and decides that such instruments are allowable as a necessary means of maintaining prison discipline. The latter opinion is doubtless the true one; a discretion must be left to the officers of a prison to use, within certain limits, what means they judge necessary for keeping convicts in order. Still the necessity to use such means seems to show a fault somewhere in the system, that it tries human nature too much, and developes a brutality, which it then has to coerce and keep down by any violent means whatever. The whole scene indeed is one which might have figured in Never Too Late to Mendfhe convict freeing the right cuff, then forcing the lock of his belt with the free right hand, then struggling with the warder, who knocks him down with the staff, and finally biting off the top joint of one of the warder's fingers. We have little doubt that under our present prison system such restraints as this "body belt" are occasionally necessary, because if we make brutes we must manage them when we have made them. Stil the question remains, whether we need make men brutes? Is not this the consequence of a departure from the natural idea of punishment? Would these men be such desperate vwretches if they were not subjected to our modern refinements of punishment ? Would they not be much more like men if they were allowed something more of the atmosphere of ordinary life, to feel themselves inhabitants of this earth, and not simply inmates of a prison? Temporary incarceration is a very proper engine of civil justice, but perpetual incarceration is unnatural-it is unnatural even as a punishment. Even without the curious additions of aggravation, perpetual solitude and the darkhole, permanent and life incarceration is of itself an artificial infliction-a torture. We connect labour, hard discipline, hard food, with punishment, but not perpetual imprisonment. That is a divergence from Nature's law of punishment. This is a fault, indeed, in our system which is at present forced upon us by the loss of our penal settlements in the colonies, but it must be remedied as soon as possible. Transportation is a far more suitable punishment for criminals than this perpetual servitude at home. Transportation is a severe and solid punishment-it is expatriation connected with hard labour and stern discipline ; it is life in its roughest and most iron shape. Still it is human life; it is social life, and it is life with hope.
One of the strangest among the many extraordinary cases which have been tried at these winter assizes was that of PHILrP CLARE, a miner, who was indicted the other day at Stafford, before Mr. Baron MIARaM, for the murder of ELIZABETH HOPLEY, a young woman 18 years of age. On the 30th of April last GxonRG Bucxnzv, a labourer, was going to his work, about half-past 4 in the morning, when he saw a human body in the Bradley arm of the Birmingham Canal. He drew it out, and it was recognized to be that of ELIZABETH fEOPLEY. The surgical evidence went to show that the girl had met her death by drowning. There were no appearances about the body to indicate previous violence; there was no trace about her head, or elsewhere, of any blow. The last time the girl was seen alive was on the previous evening, when she quitted the house of her aunt at near 10 o'clock, without bonnet or shawl, and without saying where sbe was going. At the time she was working for a certain MIr. Moocr, and the canal in which the body was found was about half way between her aunt's house and the place in which she habitually worked. It should be remarked that at the particular spot where the body was discovered the canal forms a fork, and near this spot there is a coke-hearth in full work, "the light of which is very flickering and "dazzling." The surgeon who was examined at the trial gave it as his decided opinion that when the poor girl had reached the spot where the canal forms the fork, as described, she had fallen over the wa]l of the canal, which is about two feet in height, and so had met with her death. This supposition seems coherent and conclusive enough, and but for the positive testimony of which we are about to speak there never would have arisen a doubt that the case was one of accidental death. There is, however, a certain SAMUEL WALL, a labourer, a man of somewhat questionable antecedents, who, three weeks after the death occurred, informed the landlady of the house at which he lodged that E LIZUBnT HoPI'y had been murdered, and that he had witnessed the fatal seene from first to last. Three days afterwards he was summoned before the magistrates, and gave such evidence as led to the arrest of the prisoner on the 24th of May. He stated that he knew PHILIP CLARE; that on the 29th of April, being then watchman to one MIr. RosE, at Bradley, in the discharge of his duty he came near the railway bridge. When about 100 or 200 yards away he saw two people or two shadows on the bridge, and gradually drew near it until he was distant from it but 15 or 16 yards. In this position he heard a woman's voice say, " PHiLIp, don't kill me? You " said you would kill me before." It should be remarked that EUZABETH HoP1LY had until March last been working for PHILIP CLARE, but had left his service. To resume, SA1UEL WALL saw the man on the bridge strike tbe woman a blow on the head so violent that it knocked her down. Hereupon he went up to the man,whom he instantly recognized as PHIIP CLARE, and saw him put the woman on his shoulder. " PHILIP," said WALL, "' you'll have " to suffer for this !" This was the fLint notice that CLAREb had of his presence, but a; soon as he became aware of it he turned upon WALL and said, "If you speak, rll serve you the same." VALL at the moment let him proceed, but followed him. CLARE then carried the young woman uponl his shoulder across the railway bridge to the Bradley side ; he turned to the left down a cart road between some buildings and cottages until he got close to the basin in which the body was found. All this time WALL Fsas following the murderer, and was close behind him. CLAREz now paused, and, addressing his pursuer again, said, " Now, if you " speak, or tell any one, I will kill you. I will "s serve you the same way as I served her, and set " some one else to watch instead." He then turned from him, and, carrying the body a little further, deliberately, and in WALL'S presence, put the woman in the water. This oocurred ahout 20 minutes past midnight on the night of the 29th-30th of April last. WALL went ou his way, but he had not gone above a quarter of a mile when the prisoner overtook him and renewedt his threats, and WALL, being terrified at the threats which the other had used, and apprehensive of the consequences to himself, lucked.himself up in an engine-house until daylight. Such was the atrange story which thia man told the other day to Mr. Baron MARTIN and the jury at Stafford. Had his evidence been believed, of course there would have been but one conclusion to the trial, but the jury were very naturally sceptical as to the truth of so extraordinary a narrative, which was unsupported by other testimony and in contradiction to many obvious facts of the case. The only attempt at c,)rroboration of WALs'S evidence produced by the prosecution was the testimony of one SAaIUEL HAWfXs, a watchman on the Great Western Raiway, who stated that about 11 o'clock on the night in question he heard a man and woman quarrelling near the railway bridge beforementioned. By no effort of ingenuity could the moment at which this occurred be taken as later than 11.30 p.m., and it took places in all probability, 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour sooner. Now, WALL positively fixed the time at which the body was cast into the water as at 20 minutes after midnight. Might it not be that this was the first partof a dispute of whichWALLhad, at a later period, witnessed the fatal termination ? But the watchman HAwEs, who had heard the first quarrel, must equaUy have heard the second, so that his presence and the testimony he gave mpde rather against than for the truth of WALL'S story. Passing from this point to other faet in the case, it would seem most improbable that had EXmAB=ET HoPLEY received such a blow as described upon the head, there would not have been some mark or trace of the violence. None wras discovered at the surgical examination. The story besides this contains many otber improbabilities. There were men employed about 100 yards from the bridge pumping water, who had heard nothing of the matter. Again, is it credible that a man, neither insane nor drunk, would have deliberately proceeded to complete a murder in the presence of a hostile witness ? CLARB knew WALL to be hostile to him, for he threatened-so ran the tale-to murder him too if he told of vhat he had seen. A desperate man would have at once endeavoured to silence such testimony in the only manner in which it could be done. Did he fear that alarm might be given by the noise of the struggle? A natural course would have been to cajole or to buy off the witness, or at least to make pretence of so doing, until he could catch him unawarez. A far more probable event would have been that CLARE, finding himself discovered, would not have proceeded with the fearful business in hand, for when WALL accosted him first, nothing more than a blow had passed, which had certainly reduced the poor girl to a state of insensibility. There is a long step, however, from a blow delivered in the heat of passion to the cold. blooded, deliberate murder subsequentlycommitted in presence of a man who was warning the assailant against the consequences of his act. Again, CLALE-so said the witness-carried his victim upon his shoulders along a cart road by the foot of the bridge, and just at the foot of this bridge were houses inhabited by colliers and labourers. WALL never attempted to give the alarm to them. Finally, PinILp CLAaR accounted for his time on the night in question in the following manner :-Fromn 6.30 until about 11 p.m. he was proved to have been at a publichouse at Bilston. At 11 o'clock he left the publichouse in company with one WILLIAM WOLLISCROrT and three others. WOLLISCROrv proved that he had accompanied CLAnn to about a quarter of a mile from his own house. One JoHw PLANT, a cottager, who lives near CLARE, saw the prisoner pass his door about 12 o'clock. The two men fell a-talking, and remained in conversation till near 2 o'clock. This evidence was, of course, conclusive-if believed-even without the wild improbabilities of WALL'S story; and it was believed. The prisoner was almost on the instant acquitted by the jury; this was not surprising; but it is so that a man should have come into court with the deliberate purpose of swearing away the life of a fellow-creature. it was not suggested that there was any dispute between WALL and CLARE, any malice to gratify, any wrong or fancied wrong to avenge. The scraps of dialogue introduced into the testimony exclude the supposition that he was acting under an hallueination. Was he himself concerned in the act of violence-if any there were-on the fatal night ? There seems nothing to add force to the suspicion. The story is altogether a strange one, and must remain a leading case among the few in which circumstantial evidence has set aside and destroyed the weight of positive testimony.

Stern, had the honour of an interview with his Royal Highness the Prince Consort, at Osborne, on Wednesday, to convey the expresalon of their thanks for the munificent patronage which hadbeen extended totheundertaking byHer Majesty the Queen and his Royal Highnes We believe it is the intention of the committee to forward to the contributors to the late Exhibition a formal acknowledgment of their liberality which shall specify each work of art, and thus prove of great value, in futore times, as an authentication of their property having passed through the ordeal of the criticism of the connoisseurs of Europe. A Cabinet (louncil was held yesterday, at the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury in Downing-street. The Ministers present wereViscount Palmerston, the Lord Chancellor, Earl Granville, the Marquis of Lanadowne, the Earl of Harrowby, Sir George Grey, the Earl of Clarendon, Mr. Secretary Labouchere, Lord P*nmure, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Charles Wood, the Right Hon.

WESTMI BER PLAY. Never did any comedy of Terence make so fine a boxw St. Peter's dormitory as is made by the Adalphi In this pro. sent December. That beloved picture of a sreet which exhibited its dingineu to so many generations of old and yourg " Westminsters," and was connected with antiquity rather by the age of its canvaus thbn by the object= de. picted upon it, is now swept away, taking along witlt;t the two brass-knockered doors that have been rapped at by so many Simo's and Demea's, DavusE and Sytus, and in lieu of it stands a fine bird'aseye view of Athws, with the Acropolis in the background, and on each side p- propriate domiciles for the principal paterfamilias and the feminine attractions of the juvenile hero. The dim Doai0 porch that with unmeaning simplicity once adorned the drop-scene has vanished, to make room for the restored interior of a PompeiAn theatre The heAvy crimson tent, decorated, with two inexprestive bust4 that once formed the proscenium is in like manner abolished, xid its place is supplied by a stage front sparkling with orra ments of a clasic character, and reminding the spectator, by the three names of " Plautus," "Terentius," and "lMenander," that the "new comedy" of Greece was to the Roman dramatist what the Parisian repertory is to the British adaptor of modera days. These fresh decorations, beautiful as they are, will raise a feeling of unmixed delight in the hearts of all you'sg "Westminsters," who will rilghtly bless the nanves of Professor Cockerell, who designed, and Mr. Fenton (of Sadler's Wells), who painted. Bat old "Westminsters," who recollect how often they have laughed at seeing the child of Glyceritm laid before the ugly littlU door of former times, or at beholding the door opposite invaded by Thraso and his band, Will probably devote a toar to the memory of departed shabbiness, while some older "Westminsters" still will doubtless bewail the day when Syras exchanged his red plush breeches for a brown tunlc, and Zschinus thought a chlamys more suitable than a dress coat to his Athenian shoulders. But all the spectators of yesterday evening, when the Adehi was performed for the second time thi seeaon, must have felt especial satisfaction at the manner in which the excellent old oomedy was played by the young actors. There is not among the dramati-i! person one of those decid dly ahowy parts that afford room for a great display of charater, like, for instance, the parasite in Phormio; but for a really good representationt of a con. siderable numnber of personages, this performance of the Adeiphi deserves to be recorded as one of the most creditable achievements of the Queen's scholars for many years. The two old brothers -were both wleU marked, without looking as if they had been hewn out of hard material into contrasted symbols of rusticity and urbanity. The benign dignity of Miclo sat easily upon him ; Demea vented his wrath as if he felt it, and his famous exclamation, " Sno sibi gladio hunr jugulo," was a fine bit of explosive malice. As for Syras, he Was acted with a genuine vis comica that had not a trace of scholastic training about it, and his drunken soene, terribly natural, called forth a oontinued bunst of hearty applause very easily distinguishable from the conventional approbation so freely besto wed on the ethical points of the diltogue. The faithful servant Geta, whose heart finds its readiest expression In his fist, was worked up to an earnest pugnacity that raised him to more than ordinary importance. Sostrata was a most respectable old matron, and generalt; the family of the deceased Simuluas acquired Interest from the pathos withx which Hegio declared his friendship for the departed, and his resolution to defend the unprotected child and widowr. The two young gentlemen, though not brought out in such relief as their fatber and their uncle, were most ably represented, and, like the seniors, mooved with an ease that was once uncommon on the Westminster stage. The following 'cast'" will show the gentleraen among whom the praise given above is to be distributed - Lildo.W. a Berm.L Iom.& .. .. .. W. atems arznto :w. Henty cXh .H . L ThomzpsoL fi W.

The first performance of the Westminster play being, by immemorial custom little more than a dress rehearsal, the prologue and epilogue were delivered last night for the first time. The former, spoken by Mr. Thompson. the captain of the school, referred to the horrors of Dlhi, bevailed the glorious deaths of certain old " Westminsters," in lines to which the names of Bamard, Eallett. Phillimore, and Prout, supply tho key; exulted in Colonel Greathed's defence of Agra, and wound up with a well-deserved panegyric on Professor Cockerell for his good services in beautifying the theatre. In the epilogue, Csohinus, converted by Mr. PRuskin's vorks on art, has become a fanatical prse.Raphaelite, and expresses strong disgust at the restored view of Athens. Elowever, -his attempts to inoculate his brother Cte8ipho with his peculiar ideas prove utterly abor'ive, while AMiCo, who hears the discussion, takes a liberal view of the sunject, and declares that he is ready to admire Grecian architecture and West. minister Abbey into the bargain. Among the distinguished visitors were the Turkish Ambassalor, the Dean of St. Paul's, Lord Barrington, Right Hon. Robert Lowre, hiSP., Profersor Thompson, Slr 13. l{all, .P., brk F. W.

The Coinnoissioners present were-the Bishop of Chester, Lord Stanley, ALP., the Right Hon. Sir Lawreuce Peel, the Dean of Ely, and the Rev. Dr. Vaughan. Two deputations met together ou Wednesday at the Pzivy Council-office, and had interviews with Earl Grarsuville, as the Minister presiding over the Departmt.nt of SCence and Art, with a view to induce the Government to p)urchase the Sonlages' Collection of Works of Art, lately exhibited at Mlarlborough-house and in the Art Exhibition at Manchester. The deputations consisted of the following gentlemen representing the council and nuembers of the Royal Institute of British Archltects, who were introduced by Mr. W. TVe, IILP.,-viz., Mr. J. J.

HOLyvELL-STRPRr Di DUBLIX.-On Wednesday a search for books and prints of an imroral and debaing tendency, such as was recently inDtituted in London under the now Act of Lord Campbell, took place in this city vith most suocesoful results. For months past it had been known to the police that prints and publications of a character oppoeed to all propriety and decency had been vended in particular establishments, but the traffic had been so sklf ully conducted as to render detection impossible under the terms of the oriit6al Act, which merely applied in cases where these productions were exposed to the public gaze. Mlore recenty, however, upon the passing of the Act introdtaced by Lord Campbell in the late session of Parhament, the provisions of which were found to apply to this city, active measures were tken by the authorities to suppress theevil. The information pointed chiefly To shops in Brunssick. street, Wellington-quay, and Winetavern.street, owned by the same person ; and to another house in D'Olierstreet, the proprietor of which, from having no regular connexion with the business of publication, was less liable to be suspected. Search warrants, however, could not be obtained unless mm actual sale was proved, but this difficulty having been overcome, the entire of the rnen of the 0 division, armed vwIth the requisite legal authority. proceeded in detachments sbortly after 10 o'clock a.m. on Wednesday, to search these diff%rent premises. In the hense In Brunswick-street alone were found piles of books, prints, &c., composing in the aggregate as much as could be carried by two mnen-all being of the most disgracefal nature; but in addition to these vicious prodoctionsof anore ordinary character were plastor casts aud other objects revealing a degree of infamy and moral degradation as ro which It would have been impossible previou.ly to have formed evtn a surmise. The collection likewise included two copper plates, through the instrumentality of which the propriecor could reprint his stock ad libiiusm without the necessit aand risk of importation. Theosearch was of the most Proelnged arzd harassing nature, the specimes of moral filth being conoealed in bags, under heaps of rags, and in the most unlikely and intricate hiding pla. The detective police were occupled in this quarter alone umtil after 6 o'clock. In Wlnetavern-street a number of bhoks, pamphlets, and - choice illnstatioons" were pounced upon and carried away. In D'Olier-atreet, however, tbh at was of " a bigher" clasz, bespeakdng its continentl origin.

IONRY-MAXRKTan OITYINTELLIBCBE, Thursday Evening. The English funds opened t-his morning at the last official quotations of yesterday, and sube*queatly improved in consequence of speculative purchases, the arrival of the Atlantic from New York with 340,0001. having increased the ten-dency to confidence. Consols for January were irAt quoted 91i to i, whence they advanced to 917 -to 92, the market being strengthened by the anmouncement of another reduction of the rate of dis-count by the Bank of France. Money was in good supply both in the Stock-Exchange and discount-narket, and at the Bank of England the appli-4ations were light. Bank Stock left off at 217 -to 219; EIeduced, 91A to i; New Three per -Cents., 91g to i; India Bonds, 35s. to 25s. dis,count; and Exchequer-bils, 4s. discount to par. The foreign ntock-market has been steadily sup-ported throughout the day, the chief alteration being in Buenos Avrea, which advanced to 90 and 94; Brazilian Five per Cents. were negotiated at 095 and 97, for the account, 97; ditto, 1829 and 1839, 95j; Granada Deferred, 5 , i, and I; Portu-guese, 441 and 43 ; ditto, 1856, 44g; Sardinian, for the account, 85; Spanish, for the account, 411 -and i ; ditto, New Deferred, 263 ; for the accoumt, -25S and J; Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, 941-, J, and j; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 100. The closing prices on the Paris Bourse this evening failed to arrive, but transactions for the account took place in the Three per Ceats. shortly after the opening at 67f. 25c., showing an advance of a quarter per cent. At Hamburg the rate of discount lss receded to between 7 and 9 per cent. About 64,0001. in gold was taken to the Bank today. The Bank of France have reduced their rate of discount to 6 per cent. for all descriptions of bills. Since the 6th inst. the rates had been 6, 7, and 8 per cent. respectively for bills under one, two, and three months. The advices from New York to-day are again very favourable. Although the present steamer has brought 340,0001., it was expected that the Africa, -which wiU be due at Liverpool on Monday, would have a larger sum. The two leading houses would not draw on England except at ]ll to 111J, and every one, therefore, preferred to send gold. The prospects of recovery among the various suspended houses were rapidly improving, and it is said the losses wiU prove infinitely less than could have been believed in October last. The stock-market was without much alteration. Erie was quoted 16; Reading, 52; New York Central, 72; Panama, 93; Michigan Southern, 19i; Michigan Central, 55 ; and Illinoiz Central, 93j. The suspension has been announced of the Dartford and Gravesend Bank of Messrs. Jonathan Hills and Sons. It was established about 25 years back, but its liabilities are believed to be comparatively inSignificant-probably not exceeding 20,0001. It was not a bank of issue. The failure of Mess. William Cheesebrough and Son, one of the largest woollen firms in Yorkshire, -has been definitively announced to-day in the following circular. It is feaxed this eveat will bring down many smaller houses:- "' Bradford, Yorkshire, Dec. 16. Gentlemen,-In consequence of the emnbarrassments of certain mercantile houses In which we are heavily interested we deem it prudent, for the protQoetion of ourselves and connexions, to suspend our payments. We deeply regret the neeosity for this most painaal step, but, believing confidertly that all claims upon us will be paid in full, we have only to ask the indulgence of our creditors until a statement of our affairs CaD be prepared. Oar books wil be placed in the hands of an experienced publc accountant, whose report will be laid before you at a meeting to be held on an enrly "I We are, &-o., "W. CJEESEBROUGE and SON." The publie are astounded at the commercial disclosures on every side. Even those most conversant for years past with all the great operations of business had no idea of the degree of corruption that at each turn was defeating the efforts of the honest trader. 'The question is,have they yet any adequate conception of the extent to which the system has been carried? Persons are disposed to comfort themselves by the conclusion that every case of delinquency appears in print and makes a great stir, while the multi!-ade of ordinary transactions are carried on with regularity day after day and excite no notice. There could not bo a greater delusion. Onall hands there is a combination to palliate and hush up the practices that have been prevalent, and no more difficult or dangerous duty could be undertaken than that of endeavouring to defeat it. Even if any class of observers happen to be aware of organized scheme3 of deception or of the most objectionable and suspicious features in the management of companies or firma, they can do little to warn the community until some open default has been committed, and the final explosion is consequently at hand.. The forces that were drawn together at Glasgow, consisting of the aristocracy and wealth of Scotland, to beat down all who might attermpt to question the position of the Western Bank and to expose Its vile -career furnished a specimen of the obstacles to be encountered; and it is a fact that, while that concern was applying for help to the other banks, even the statement that these banks wished to stipulate for a winding up of its affairs was widely denounced as a malignant libel. In another case a firm whose position was understood, but which had contrived through the help of the Weatern Bank temporarily to arrest an exposure, induced a well-known legal house in London to protest against the damage " recklessly" inflicted on its credit by the mention of its name, although within a fortnight of that date it was shown to be disgracefully insolvent. When Mr. Oliver broke down at Liverpool after a career of speculation, in the height of which he had been presented by his admiring, townspeople with a service of plate, some .of the leading mercbants, including thechairman of the Borough Bank, and, it is believed, Mr. De Wolf, of the great firn of De Wolf and Co., which has iust stopped for about 200,0001., showing 2s. in the pound for its creditors, actually posted a notice on the Exchange, contradictiugand stigmatizing the announceament as a wanton injuiry. If this is the experience in the most rotten and hopeless cases, what would have to be expected if a breath were uttered regarding any concern that might still by possibility be patched up so as to allow of its defving all impu- tations ? The case of the North o f Europe Steam Company, in which a warning to the public aggravated the injury it was intended to avert, since it -drew forth an unqualified denial from the directors which led many persons to increase their investiments at high prices, will be fresh in recollection. The habit is universal, and is encouraged in all quarters. There is abundant sympathy -for the speculator who has lived in good style for years, and whose position may at last be questioned; but none for the great mas of the people, who in consequence of his operations have been paying higher prices for all the necessaries of lfe; none for those who have been tempted by high wages into over-stocked branches of labour, and who are suddenly thrown into destitution; and none for society in general, which will suffer tbrough masny. future years from a generation of young mnen brought up to the belief that there ia no such thing as honest trade, and that he is greatest -rho most excels in the adulteration of goods, -the manufacture of acommodation bills, and the management of fraudulent suspensions. Such ia ever the case. The offender in his distress is a tangible object of pity, while the community he has wronged and dishonoured is only a shadowy conception; and Government in relieving hin, evert at the cost of violating a law, merely tacs out the wishes of the majority. In these circumstances it will be easily understood that not one I tithe of the delinquencies that now pervade every branch of trade are likely to come to light. There i3 no legal machinery to promote any such object but a most extensive and almost resistles3 action on the other side. The Legislature have always been too busy In meddling as to the nature of obligations which commercial men should be allowed to undertake to be able to devote time to the introduotion of laws to enforce under swift and adequate penalties the simple principle that every obligation once made must be faithfuUy fulfilled, and to bring to justice every one who has robbed another by false pretences. There was much display of business in this line last session, but it has apparently effected nothing. The prosecution of the British Bank directors was a wonderful effort to mark the inauguration of a new reigr of virtue, but it is understood the experiment is never likely to be repeated, the costs and confusion having been awful. Notwith standing all the notoriety of his case, it is easy to prophesy that Mr. Stephens, of the London and Eastern Corporation, will escape, to enjoy the remainder of his life on the marriage settlement acquired from the funds of that establishment. From the first, the other directors have never even been threatened with prosecution. It is true the daily journals are now filled with developments of cases of sequestration or bankruptcy, or of the winding up of fraudulent concerns; but these are all exceptional, and any one reading the proceedings will see that they merely relate to a few stragglers that have been caught out of a whole army of marauders. Every word uttered in the various examinations serves to show how the individual Insolvent was but one of a constantly extending circle-how he was terrified into lending more money or granting further acceptances by creditors who threatened to fail and expose him, and how he in turn got more from some one else-in most cases the manager of a joint-stock bankby pursuing a similar course. In one case now pending at Glasgow a house is shown to have had 75 real or fictitious correspondents, all insolvent like itself, upon whom it had drawn to the amount of 380,0001., the whole finally centering in the Western Bank. Is this a solitary specimen? Are there not hundreds of analogous but more adroit cases that might be developed on every side-often, apparently, without much difficulty, if any judgment may be formed from the leading figures lately presented in some of the London balance-sheets; and as soon as the present crisis is over, will not all these persons again go to work ? In the present state of the law there is nothing to obstruct and everything to encourage them. The belief Is that, notwithstanding the recent wrecks and the lateness of the period to whlch the "r relief" granted by the suspenslon of the Bank Charter Act was deferred, the accommodatiot paper still in circulation in London and throughout the kingdom would present a total such as few persons not accustomed to reflect on such matters would be prepared to expect. The remedy, of course, would be to punish the drawers and acceptors for conspiracy to defraud. Every bill of exchange purports to have been for " value reeived." If two men conspire to manufacture such a document and to pasa it as genuine into the hands of a third, nothing can be more obvious than the nature of the transaction. But Parliament perhaps would rather pass a whole session in discussing whether they could devise some new measures to interfere with the natural course of enterprise, and direct it into such channels as might be fashionable with them for the moment, than descend to so small a matter as this simple application of the criminal law. The adjourned meeting of creditors of Mesr. Bardgett and Picard, corn merchants, whose failure for 85,1421. was announced on the 16th tilt., was held this morning, when it was resolved to wind up the estate under Inspection. The firm are to give promissory notes for a dividend of 2s. 6d. in the pound in three instalments of 6, 9, and 12 months, the liquidation of the notes to be effected earlier if the realization of assets should permit, and in the event of any surplus remaining after payment of the composition a further distributtion is to be mnade. Mr. Turquand explained, with reference to a statement at a former meeting, that on the 1st of January, 1856, when the capital of Messrs. Bardgett and Picard waas estimated at 24,3144, Mr. Wallace was a creditor for value of surplus securities held by the firm. A loss of 20,0001. had taken place on the conversion of these securities, and Mr. Wallace's name was transferred from the credit to the debit of I their account. A meetlng of creditors of Messrs. Gorrisen, HIffel, and Co., whose suspension was announced on the 18th ult., was held to-day, when the following atatement was submitted by Mr. Quilter, the accountant:- STATEMEYT OF THE AFFAIRS or 3ESSiS.

At the date of the stoppage the liabilities on acceptances were 471,9141., besides debts to unsecured creditors to the amount of 84,1344.; but, as a great portion of the former have been or will be provided for by the drawers, the assets are estimated to prove sufficient to pay a dividend of about ]3s. 4d. In the pound. The losses were stated to be 58,0001. Of the good debts 30,0001. is due from Amnerica, 20,0001. of which is from one house alone, which has offered to pay 75 per cent. in cash down, and the remainder at a future period, so that little apprehension need be entertained as to the ultimate realization of these claims. After a short conversation it was resolved to wind up the estate under inspection, and a committee of three creditors was appointed accordingly. A meeting of Buienos Ayres Bondholders was held this afternoon, 3Ir. David Robertson in the chair, to consider the terms of the new decree for the arraTgement of the English debt. The chairmaz stated that he had to announce a naost satisfactcry settlement ot their claims. He then recapitulatedi the various iaeasures that ha& been taken to o?sagm this adjusment, and observed-that it was creAM:aNa to the Govaeament of BEenos.

Annexed is a translation of the law passed by the Bueno3 Ayres Legielature:- " Art. L The Executiva rower Is authorized to conclude the settlement of the debt of the London loan under the following bases and couditions:- "L To meet the interest and sinkdng fund on the original debt the Government will pay, in 1857, the sum Of 36,0001.; in 1858, 48,0001.; in 1859, 60,0001.; and in 1860 and thenceforth, 65,0001. until the complete extinction of the capital. " 2. For the amount of Interest in arrear, and which may be overdue to the end of 1858, the Government will issue new bonds, which will bear the following interest :-Fronm 1861 to 1865 inclusively at 1 per cent. per annum; frora 1866 to 1370 inclusively at 2 per cent. per annum; and in 1871 and thenceforth at 3 per ceut. per annum, assigning 2 per cent. per annum, or the 200th part of their total amount, for a sinking fund.

The State of Buenos Ayres eserves the rights which appertain thereto for a period when the Argentine Contedera'ion may unite, represented in a general congress, with respect to the obligations assumed by this law." This measure has been passed by large majorities in both Houses, and the bondholders have high legal opinion that from the estates being mortgaged to the English creditors they have the right, if necessary, to call upon the Foreign Secretary to interfere in their favour. After a short conversation, the following resolutions were passed unanimously:- " 1. That this meeting, having well considered the terms for the adjustment of the English debt of Buenos Ayres# contained in the Act of Its Legislature, dated the 28th of October, 1857, which has passed both Houses by large muajorities and become law, and as such has been communicated by the executive Government of Buenos Ayres to Mesars. Baring, Brothers, and Co., and by them to the British public, to the committee, and to the holders of Buenos Ayrean bonds, hereby aees to accept the same in all Its integrity. " 2. That this meeting desires to express the high sense entertained by the bondholders of the honourable conduct which has characterized the whole of these negotiations and proceedings on the part of the present Government of Buenos Ayres, and in an especial manner of his Excellency Ssnor Riestra, its Finance Minmster, and no less so of the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Buenos Ayres-an aet which this meeting trusts, as it believes, will greatly strengthen the bonds of unfon and intimacy between the Governments and the people of Buenos Ayres and of England, and largely increase the commercial snd friendly Intercourse between the two nations for the mutual benefit of both. " 3. That this meeting desires once more to express its wa&rm and sincere acknowledgments to the Right Hon. the Earl of Clarendon for the able and friendly assistance so freely and so conshutly afforded throughout the whole of this negotiation by his Lordship and Her Majesty's Government, and to Its representatives at Buenos Ayres, hisExcellency Mr. Christie and Mr. Parish, towards bringing this long-pending matter to so satisfactory a conclusion. " 4. This meeting begs also to expressits hearty acknowledgments to the house of Messrs. Baring, Brothers, and Co., the contractors of this loan, and the agents of the Buenos Ayrean Government In England, for their valuable and unwearied exertlons for many years past,, and their able negotiation of this matter at Buenos Ayres during the present year, through their talented and upright agent, Mr. George White, which has mainly led to the satisfactory result and adjuatment which this meeting has just ratified and confirmed. "5 :. That the cordial thanks of this meeting be given to the Spanish American Committee for their exertions In the cause of the bondholders, and also for providing the neees. sary funds to defray the expenses ineurtred. "i6. That the amount of Deferred Bonds to be appropriated under the vote of the bondholders on the 2d of June, 1856, to defray the expenses of the committee, to reward the Bondholders'Commisidoners, and other officers, and i o pay many other charges and incidental expenses, be placed in the hands of three members of theSpanish AmerlcanCom. mittee-namnely, J. D. Powles, Esq., the chairnmn; David Robertson, Esq., and Joseph Tasker, Esq.; and three of the bondholders-namely, Charles X'Garel,Esq., John Paphael, Esq., and James Capel, Esq., to be disposed of ai they may think proper." The Patna, Sir James, and Mirage have arrived from China, bringing in the aggregate 1,336,5001b. of tea and 2,760 bales of silk. The Manchester C-uardiant announces the failure of Mr. James EHolmes, carpet manufacturer, of Kidderminster, with liabilities to the amount of 35,3001.; the assets are estimated at 27,4001. At a meeting of creditors on Tuesday it w resolved to wind up the estate under inspection. At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day certificates of the first class were granted to Mr. George Scrivens and Mr. Francis Smith, of the Hastings Old Bank. The examination of the two other partners, Mr. Tilden Smith and Mr. James Hilder, was again adjoiurned. The estate has paid lOs. in the pound, and a further dividend of from 3s. to 5s. in the pound is anticipated.

AmmRIcAN FINAN E.-The city banks showed on Monday last an average specie deposit for the preceding week oS over $24,000,000. Such an amount of specie was never held in our bank vaults before; il Is, perhap;s more than was held in all the Northern States at the time of the revulsion of 1837. Simultaneously with this singular aggre. gation of specie In the banks we have to note a steadY and universal contraction of business and general liquidation among the merCbunts. Though It is notorious that the banks were ready last week to discount almost everv piece of paper that could be had, the loans show a falling off equsl to half a million or thereabouts, showing that mer. chants required lat week half a miliona less accommodation than they had the 'week before. It is true that some specie is going to Europe; but as the cotton bills will be coming on so freely-in the course of the present month-as to pay all we owe In Europe, that before new year the specie drain must have fallen below the receipt from California. The present prospect is that our banks wUl hold all winter not less than twenty millions of gold, and that they wlli have much smaller demands for accommoda. tion than they had last year -with half as much specie. Simultaneously 'wth this strange and un. usual prosDect, we learn from the officida returns of the fiscalyear 1856-7 that during that year the trade of the lTnitedStates with the world did not leave us in debt. True we took from foreign countries goods to the amount of $348,428,342, while the aggregate amount of our produce sold to foreign countries, and of foreign goods re-exported from hence, is only $293,812,222, showing an excess of goods imported over produce exported of over 50 millions of dollars. But this calculation does not lnmlude our trade 1I orne of our staples-gold, of which we sent abroad last fiscal year $69,136,922., receiving only $12,461,799, thus leaving enough on the credit side to turn the general balance in our favour by over two millions of dollars. Last fiscal year the same tables thowed a balance of 12 millions in our favour, which may nr may not have been very accurate; -but there is little doubt of the accuracy of the balance-sheet of this Year. It is asingular factenoughthSatGreatBritainis theouly country of any consequence which tskes from us more than we take from her. AllQtker countries sell us far more thau they bny-France, Spai, the Zo}verein, Brazil, Chill China, &e. ; Great Britain alone sells us over 12 millions less than we eell her. Bat for the faet that Great Britain sezves as banker, not only for us, but for a great masny of our dealers in business, tle excharges would be all tb0 otber way; as it is, we pay al our ChiDa, Brazil, and 3uost of our Spanis debtaby bills on London. Spain is tha most imvootant coantry to us, in a commercial point of view. We take i.oD Spain but little less than $60,00,000 of marcbandise-chitfly sugas, molasase, c,, from Cuba aed the West ludies-while. se takes from us but little over $20,OKWO of flour, provisea% and manufactured goods. If (2uba belonged to us, alltM trade, which would be decupled helora long, would be part of our domestic trade, Our aggregate trade, as we said, Is in round numbers, $i330.,OC0,G ea way per year.

I T-H WESTERN BANK OF SCOTLAND. - -----W (BY ELEOTBIC AND iNTBIFATIo0AL, TELEGrArH.) GLASGOW, Tf1uRsDAY. At tho aajomnred meeting of the shareholders this afternoon the repott of the committee of investigation was given in. It stated that the liabilities of the bank were 8,911,9321.; the aaets for payment of the liabilities were 8,607,2101., showing a deficiency of assets of 304,6921., and thus making, including the capital and rest, reported in last statement at 1,715,8924, an estimated loss on the whole transactions of thle company of 2,020,5841, The heads under which the deficiency arose were minutely stated. On bills held by the bank the loss was 437,0001; on advances and balances on current acCount, S85,0001. ; on securities held in New York, 60,0001.; on debts in suspense account, 685,0001., and other Items. The assets were valued as for winding-up, not as a solvent and going concern; but, with prudent management and better times, there might yet be a great saving on the estimated loss. The bank's misfortunes are attributed to gross negligence on the part of the directors, and wild recklessness in Taylor, the late manager. After a stormy discussion the committee was reappointed. The shareholders again meet on the 30th current to take steps for windlns up.
THE WORKRO USE A1V THE GA OL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-A few days ago we had here a large meeting of the ratepayers, at which the Mayor presided, to take into consi. deration the present condition of the unemployed. Atthat meeting one of the speakers said,- " He vwished to ask how it was thelr workbouse was so much reviled. Every one who went through it testified to its adrulrable arrangements and to the excellent education received by the children in it, and he wanted to know why they heard so muoh againet the ' Bastile,' as it was called ? The food used in the house was as good as he had himself, for he tasted it nearly every week." As there is a general feeling of disli}e on the part of those who have dwelt in a workhouse, aud as there is, on the other hand, a general feeling of wonder on the part of those who have not dwelt in one that this dilike should exis, will you allow me, Sir, to make a few remarks in reply to that part of the speaker's speech vwhich I have just quoted? ': Admirable arrangements" in the workhouse ! If, now, the admirable arrangements of the workhouse ought to suppress the feeling of dislike towards that, so also ought the admirable arrangements of the gaol to suppress the feeling of dislike towards iL I will show, Sir, that were I a criminal sentenced to six months' imprisonment in our borough gaol I should be better fed, better educated, and have less work to do than I should as a six months' dweller in our borough workhouse. First, as to food. I write from the prlnted official dietaries of both establishments:- WOB1;OUSX BREAKFAST. GAOL BREAKFAST. Every morning in the week Four mornings in the week 7 cz. of bread and a pint and one pint of oatmeal gruel and a half of milk porridge, 8 oz. of bread; three morn- ings in the week one pint of cocoa (sweetened) and 8 oz. of bread. WORK3;OUSE SUVPEP. GAOL SUPPER. Three nights in the week Every night 1 pint of oat11 pint of milk porridge and meal gruel and 8oz. of bread. 7oz. of bread. Four nights In the week lAoz. of cheese and 7oz. of bread. No advantage on the side of the gaol, so far, perhaps; but now let us look at the dinners:- SUNDA&Y. WORKHOUSE. GAOL. Boz. of cooked meat and 4oz. of cooked meat, 16oz. 160z. of potatoes. of potatoes, and 6oz. of bread. MON'DAY. 4oz. of bread and 1 pint 1 pint of soup, 16oZ. of I of peas soup.

TuEsDAY. 50z. of cooked meat and 4oz. of cooked meat, 16oz. 16oz. of potatoes. of potatoes, and 6oz. of bread. WEDNESDAY. 1. pint of meat soup and i pint of soup, 16oz. of 4oz. of bread. (This soup potatoes, and 6oz. of bread, does contain so much meat end potatoes as does the gaol soup.) THURSDAY. 5oz. of cooked meat and 4oz. of cooked meat, 16oZ. 16oz. of potatoe of potatoes, and 60z. of bread. FRIDAY. 1A plnt of broth and 5oz. 1 pint of soup, 16Oz. of po. of bread. tatoes, and 60z. of bread. SATURDAY. 16oz. of suet pudding. 4oz. of cooked meat, lgoz. of potatoes, and 6oz. of bread, Remark upon this comparison Is needless, as every one may see for himself how superior is the dietary of the gaoL Secondly, as to education,-In the gaol I should have one hour's instruction every day; in the workhouse I should have none at alL Thirdly, as to work. Now, everybody knows that I might be sentenced to an imprisonment without hard labour. To leave out that part of my doom, therefore, would better suit my argument. But, I will have a six months' imprisonment at " hard labour," as It is oalled. Well, what is it, and how does it stand in comparison with the workhouse test ? Suppose I work at the crank (I speak now of Lesicester Borough Gaol, though I have no reason for supposing that it may not apply to other borough gaols as well), the turning of the handle is so easy that I could very comfortably do all I have to do, and read a book at the same time. Indeed, I find that a prisoner with a taste for literature will not unfrequently do this. And then I can perform my daily task in five hours. Sappose I am set to the treadwbeel. 'Tis not very pleant, certainly, to be mounting its unceasing steps, and to get no higher for it. But of constant work, four hours and a-half a day will do It. The plan is this-the prisoner works 15 minutes, then rests nine minutes, and the average number of hours a-day, on and off, is seven; this, therefore, leaves not quite four hours and a-half of work, with two hours and a-half of rest. Well, what must I do at the workhouse ? Taklng the year round the stipulated hours of work exceed those of the gaoL And as to the quality of the work, oakum picking (a ias cast-off-old-tar-rope picking) is certainly very apt to peel the fingers of a new beginner, is very filthy work, uad is uncommonly disagreeable to any nose that rebels against tar, Altogether it does not recomnmend itself to my choice so strongly as does the treadwheel or the crank. "Pick your 31b. per day, Sir, of that old tar-rope, or you'll go vithout your meals." Such is the order of theworkhouse; and the gaol requires less of me on the score of hard work than does that, and this is true even though I get sentenced to hard labour. If I escape that, of course, the gaol arrangement will be aU the more " admirable." It may probably he said, " But you lose your character if you go into gaol." Granted; and -when I think of that I cannot but honour that sense of right in the unemployed poor at this time vhich keeps them out of gaol, though they know well that they would be better treated there than at the workbouse. Why, It is a well-known fact among our gaol offioials that many have been in both places, and have said, " We'd rather be here than at Dickison's?'-Dicklnson being the master of the workhouse. But ought these things to be ? Ought we thus to put a premium upon criune, and thus insult the honest poor ? But there are worse things, in my humble opinion, still about our workhouse system. Poor men love their wives and children as much as rich men; but there they must be eom from them, and only allowed to speak to them once a week. Mothers in poverty love their little ones as much as mothers in wealth, and I know that there are maniy poor mothers In Leicester who muss be driven to starvation before they will go-so strongly do they love. We are reating our men and women who happen to be very poor worse than our criminals; we are separating man and wife in direct violation of God's law, as though they were cattle, whom (I forbear to finish the sentence)-and then we preach and lecture about poverty being no sin. Our workhouse and its arrangements are quite admirable enough for the idle, the dissolute, and the drunken poor, who may work, but who will noe work; but at a time like the present, when in every large manufacturiDg town thousands of honest and industrious people are unemployed and destitute, I take it as a reproach to a board of guardians that will force a peor man to break up his home, rather than give to him temporary out-door relief, and especially so when that can be done to his entire satisfaction at onethird the cost. I am, Sir, yomrs very rsspeotfullv. SANDERS J. CREEW. Leicester, Dec. 16. A GRASnD BATnTmi-The Dake of Oam'hrige has Ioen shooting in SauiIk, on the estate of Lord RuutZigfield. Heveninghamball.

INDIA REFOR3M. A publio meeting was held last evening, at St. Martin'shall, to consider the condlition of India and the working of the" double Government." Lord Bury, M.P., was in the chair, There were present MIr. Roebuck, hL..; Mr. Otway, Mr. Mead, Mr. Norris, Mr. E. Jones, &c. There was by no mneans a ful attendance in the body of the room. The CH rArXA stated the object for which the meeting had been convened; and observed that the recent mutinies in India were not the immediate cause of calling the present meeting on the subject of the government of India, as tho question had been agitated for years. In the House of Cormmonis Mr. Kinnairdhad moved for an nquiry into tbe subject of landed tenures, and Sir E. Perry had brought forward fiscal questions relating to India, vhile in the House of Lords Lord Albemarle had moved for an inquiry into the systsem of torture practised in that country. The subject therefore of the governineint of India was not new to the people of this country. Mr. RoEBUCK then came forward to move the first resolution. He said,-My Lord Bary-We have met here for a very Important purpose. Other countries have been pleaed to devolve the government of their affairs elther to one man or to a few men, but to Englishmen it has seemed fit that they should take the government of their own affairs into their own h.ads; and, although we do devolve the power of the Government to a certain number of persons, who meet in certain houses in Westminster, yet it does happen that the people of this country do take upon themselvs to express their own opinion and to inform their representatives what those opiniona are. We are now doing what I have just described. We ere about to tell the governing claeses of this country what the people of England think about the Government of India. (Efear, hear.) We are met for that purpose, and I think we are engaged in an important task. I have therefore considered it my duty to come among you on the present occasion. Although it happens that I am one of those who meet in that celebrated house in Westminster, yet I do believe that there are occasions when it behoves the people of this country to speak out (cheers), for there is something in the atmosphere of that house which every now and then deadens all English feeling, and requires the voice and the heart6 of the peoplo to inspire those who sit there with the feelings of Englishmen. I beliove that at this present moment there is abroad a feeling in England with regard to India which has never been equalled sinoe EngLand was England. We have aquired a doninion there such as the worid never has seen. Even Rome in her palmiest days possessed not an empire equal to ours. That empire has been attained by the hardinood, the sagacity, and. the great qualities of the People of England. We owe it not to any of the distinguished classes. The clerk from the desk, the great :live, waS the founder of the empire of England in India. (Hear, hear.) The population of that empire, according to the last accounts, amounta to about 200,000,000 of inhabitants, all of whomn are under our rule. Of the wealth of that country I will not now speak. But having acquired dominion over such an empire-oS the justice of that acquisition I now say nothing-it becomes our duty to exercise that dominion upon princ ples of fairness to those millions whom we have subjugated. We came to their shores a trading company, and we pretended to enter into a mere trading correspondence with them. But it has so happened that from that time to this we have been an aggressive people. We have, however, whatever the means, acquired dominion in India. For the happinessof thegreatinassof the seople I beheve that that dominion provides in a far greater egree than their own native Governments. For the mass of the governed the government of India by England is a blessing; but, though it be a blessing, still I beUeve our power has been acquired by unjust means. In acknowledging that as I at once do, I also acknowledge that upon the people of England there weighs a great responsibilty. It is our duty now, having acquired possssion of that country, so to govern it tbat inthe eyes of God and man we my stand justified as its ralers. But It must be confessad that from the time of our first acquisition to the present momentgreat faults have been comnmitted In the government of that country, and great injustice has been inflicted upon ita inhabitants. Let me, however, distinguish. The great mass of the inhabitants of India have derived vast benefit from the government of England; but there is a governing class, and they have been bowed down by the superior power of England. They are our enemies, and will be our enemies to the last. This governing class, If left to themselves, would be the curse of the great body of the people, We stand in the position of these governieg classes, and we have to distinguish ourselves from them, and by the qualities of our rule to justify our dominion. How, then, have we acted ? For many long years the East India Company was a trading body. It then pleased Mr. Pitt who was the great political opponent of Mr. Fox, to brino in his India Bill. Mr. Fox had endoavonred to make the Government of India a Parliamentary Government. There was then ruling in England a man called George the Third, and he ham Parliamentarydominion, and believed that if India was given up to Parliamentary rule he would be the slave of Parliamaent. In conjunction, therefore, with Mr. Pitt, he cajoled the people of England into believing that Mr. Fox intended great injury to him. Ur. Fox was accordingly turned out, and MIr. Pitt then brought in his India Bill; and what did he propose? ? Ir. Pitt was an acute and quick-witted man, and, having got the Directors of the East India Companyto aid him in discharging Mr. Fox, be turned roand upon his associates and made In reality a Parliamentary Government of India; but he made it so in such a fashion as to do away with all possible chance of any good arising therefrom. He made it In the form of which the resolatlon speaks, He formed what is cauled the double Government. The Court of Directors down in Leadenhall-street were to be controlled by a Board meeting in Cannon-row. At the head of that Board is the president thereof. He is the real ruler of India. He can do exactly as he pleases. The Court of Directors are bound to obey bins, and they do obey him. But then they play that game which children describe as " It is no child of mine." If anything happens amiss, the Board of Control says-" I am not answerable" -and the Court of Directors say-" We are noi answerable"-and the Governor-General of India sas-" I am not answerable." So that by dividing the responsibility, and at the same time concentrating the power, the President of the Board of Coutrolbecomestheirresponsible governor of India. That it is upon which we wish by our resolation to pass the censure of this meesting. W e say if India is to be governed well the Government must be responsible, and for that reason I mean to propose-first, that the Board of Directors be entirely done away with. (Hear.) If we accomplish that good object we wiU then go one step further, and destroy the Board of ControL Inthe place of these I would erect a single man, and I would call him " tho Secretary of State for India,"'andaupon him I would concentrate all the responsibility. Lot me distinguish. Tbere are two very different purposes for which all legislation for India is concerned. The first is the establishing of a machinery in England by which to concentrate responsibility here,; the getting op of a feeling among the people of Eingland to act upon the goerning body in India. For that purpose the Legisature needs no further inquiry. We can do it at once, and I was going to say for ever. But there is a further object-namely, to frame resolutions embodying principles by which India should be governed, and framing a machinery in India by which those resolutions may be carried into effect. In order to begin these le.islative improvements we must do away with the Court of Directors aud tbo Board of ControL Having done that, and having created a Secreary of State for India, the House of Commons will then be hound to inu into the best way of governing that country. That brings me to the question, namely, on what principles ought we to base our Indian Government, and by what machinery can wes carry those principles into effect. Haning got a Secretary of State for India, we should have a Government in India. I would propose for the three Presidencies-Bengal, Madras, and Bombay-that there should be three Governors, as at present*batthat all thelPresidencies should be governed by a municipal body, so that Englishmen in India should govern themselves as far as the condition of the country would permit; for the condition of India as compared with all other colonies is peculiar. All other colonies are formed by Englishmen, They go out from this country and carry vwith them the feelings, the language. the customs, the clvracter, and the capacities of Englishmen. The best thing you can do for a colony so formed is to allow it to govern itself. In fact, they carry out a little England. The colony grows up and bscomes a great community, and It is best governed by being self-governed. Bat India is a very different thing. We go there as conquerors. We find a race differing from ourselves in language, in religion, in arts, in everything There is an actual type of the character of the Indian to be seen in the tiger-the soft, velvetty paw, the beautiful lIne of grace in all its movements; but death lurks under that p6w; cruelty such as the heart can hardly conceive dwells in that breast. (Hear, hear.) I ask you, all of you who have read of the deeds of the last two months, whether your hearts have not contracted, your cheek turned pale, and your breath gone away at the horrors perpetrated upoa your countrymen and countrywomen? (Hear, hear.) Do you beliere that EngUshmen in the wildest fury that belong to such men could have done such deeds? Oh, no ! (Cheers.) I cannot believe that there is a man in Engiland that would hr'-e perpetrated any one of the horrors that I have read of. (ear, bear.) But I was feebly describing the difference between the character of the Hindoo *.nd an Englishman. Englishmen can governthemnselves; Bindoos cannot. Having acquired dominion of Hindostan, the government of that country devolves upon England. and England alone, and not upon the people of Hindostan. If you were to treat them as you would Eoglishmeu. if vou were to give them institutions of self-governmuent, aud then leave them to themselves, there would be intermiinable anarchy, confusion, and horror. England most, tbeD, govern India, and must establish there English ideas and English principles. Having, tben, to govern India with English feelings, the question is by what nmaehinery shaU we govern them so as to do it with justice to the natives. The first thing Is that there must be perfect liberty as regarAs religion. I don't mean that you are to foster the prejudices, the ignorances, and the abominations of the, Elindoo religion. No such thing. But I wosud allow ever.vman to foUow the light of that reason whieh God has giv%J him. Yon have to set a good example by your raex enlightened religions principles, and, baving est&blV,5 perfect freedom on that point, I would requ- re yon to make the religion of the. government of lnu%fthe Christian reUgion. (Cheers.) Having done this, y'se must them establish a role by which justice shall be %e.mia4erga. And here let mne say a word about the old I adi&v, I aoa told whenever I speak of India anil of establ .idahin. jstise there, " Oh, you must libten to the experi enea of the old Indians." But these old Indians biAve 0 one somue things by which any man may esrimate the 'alae and character of their knowledge. 1 hoari a geatlerumn in the House of Commons assert that trtD e was employed in indiaforttkeparpose of colleceiva tf , revenue, when he was inamediatoy followredby av X J odian who weR a direc. tor of the Eaftr India ComDa *' ,d had been a chairman of the Court Ot Directors \X. distinuntly, boldly, and with great vehemence * * tbet tori,re was eves perpetrated in India fer aDy such pu-pose, the vehemaence of hs denial, the irninew, aiye, the andacity with which he denied '.,t wor upon the House of Commons, and they cheered as t' jey a1- says do oheer a b..ld statemen. But not lon1g after a cor.,ittee sat on the subject, And a relort was sAde, '1 * eaA t at report, and it confirmed alU that Lad been asserted about t'e use of torture in tho BeLiEsti dom;iions. I have lived long enough to cell to that gentleman's mind the firmness, the vehemenoe. and the unresita. tingDess of bis denial, I did it in the House of Commons, and I sUenced him. (Cheers.) There are men here who ,were present on thAt occasion. (Hear, bear.) That was the first instance I derived of the value of an old Indian's experience. The next was stiU more remarkable. Up to the very hour of-nay, even after the oatbreak Qf the Sepoys a very old Indian told us that no outbreak would take place. The Sepoy, he ag was docile and faithful and would never rebel. But while this was being said the Sepoya did rebel, and the very men who said these things of the,a were cut down by their own servants, and the ladies with whom they had lived And frcm whom they had received nothing but kindnees and tenderness of treatrment, and even the rery childrn whom they hed fondled and nursed, were murdered by them. (hfear, hear.) Agin, then, I say, we may by tL4s test the value of the old Indian's experience, (Hear. hear.) The result, then, of aU this is-let us not go to old Indians for knowledge about India. It you want to know the true state of India, go to the hard working missionary, go 1o the traders, don't go to the Governors, who are surroundod hy flatterers, and who are bowed dowan to by the Hindoo. They go out to India from this coantry young and inexpierienced, and are captiv ted by the beautiful and gracefjl approach of the Mlindoo. They look with gauze before their eyes, and know not vrbat is around them. They know nothing of the Hlndoo character. Szuh being the case, an inquiry must take plaoe regardiig the principles on which the future government of Indit is to be founded. But I warn the Government as to the soEt of evidence which they receive. I have not much more 0o say. (Cheers.) But before I close let me say oue word to you as reproeenting the people of Englan4 Recollect that you have taken upon yourselves the government of India. You are answerable for all that happens to be done in the name of the people of England towaras that country. Among other deeds lhich Engznd has doue has been the acquisition o' Hindostan. There Is an enormous population under your dominion, weak and uncIvilizei. 5ou are still the governors of that country, and I would b6seech you to recollect the deep responsibilitytthxt now presses upon you. You have to govern India; and upon your shoulders will rest the responsbility for the mode in which that country is henoeforth governed. Your repre. sentatives require the spur, and sometimes they require the bridle; it is you upon vwhom It devolves to use that spur andto guide that bridle. Youhave a free press andyou are enabledto say wvhat you like. You must take every means of impressing upon your representatives the necessity of watching carefully the government of India. It is a great and onerous duty, but having taken upon ourselves the government of thast country we are bound, as honest men, to see it wrell-governed. In the next aestion the subject cannot be shelved. The people have had thiir feelings too much excited to allow the goverument of that country to remati in the hands of those who ha,ve hitherto governed it since the scenes that bave incurrqd. Depend upon it, Parliament will have to bring to bear uporn the government of India all the intellect and all the hidependence that it possesses, bhut that intelloct and that inaependenoe vill faUif not backed up by popular opinion; and I entreat every muan within his circle to weiRh well within hlmself the mode and manner in which he thinks England ought to govern the people of India. I believe the time is at hand when aU of you will have a direct influence in the Government of this country. (Cheers.) When that period arrives your responsiblity will be still greater. The great body of us now can cprtainly influence the councils of the nation by our opinion, but the time is not far fromn hence when you will be, ableto determine by your vote whoshaU govern England. When that time arrives I hope to see a good Government In India-good government wherever the power of Easgland extends, and I ask to what part of the earth it does not extendc? For, strange to sty, these small islands exercise an influence upon m,ankind which no Governmenit ever before wielded. These islands are great 3n letters, in art, in science, in knowledge, and in hap iness. The people of England are like a torch set up to enlighten mankind. You have been enabled, through Providence, to extend your dominion over the whole face of the globe, and it now remains to be seen whether Englishmen are as good as they are brave, whether they are as wise as they are sagacious, aud whether they can conduce to the happiness ,of mankind as much as they have conduced to the greatness of England. (Cheers.) The hon. gentleman then moved {he following resolution:- *'That the 'sstem of the double Government of Iudig - te by tbe results of Its administration, has proved ilike inoomrpatible witk the welfare and h4ppiners of our fellow-gubiects in that country and with the safety and commercial pro'perity cf sbe Br{ldeh empire. and therefore that, witis a view to secure our naSonal interest, and also to raipe the toral end POrtal condition of tbe peoDle of India, to develope their resources, and to gire them protection for person and propeits-, It bl expedient that there be estabimshed for India a responsible ferms of GloTerument In tbe name ot the Cvrwa, uneer which all abuses u;sy be cheeked by the control of the people of England, exersiosdthroegh their representatives in the House of Qomucos" I Mr. OTNVi A- seconded the resolution, and Mr. M4x.A, the I late editor of the Friend of India, suoported it.

TiH T.ATE SiR GEoRo,E CAYLLy.-The death of Sir George Cayley took plaoe on the 15th i7ast., at the advanced age of 84. As a scientifio man be held a -#ery distinguished position. His inventive genius first displayed itself in the successful analysis of the mecheaical pro. pertlies of air under chymical and pbysical action. Mis papers on this sahject were published in the philosophical journals of the day, and gave rise to a number of experiments both in this country and abroad on 'the navigation of balloons, which then took up munch of the publio attention. He pointed oat tse fallacy of any hopes of success in the absence of a givea power within a given weight; and, being well-ac. quainted with the steam-engine, on wh}ih be bd made many experiments with a view to the eonstroctiot of the disc and rotatory engine, he showed that there was little chance of obtaining sufficient power frem st4in. These inquiries led to his invention ef the airengine, a. masterpiece of original conception, which proved the Rreat advantage of using expanded air insteadof toeam, where weight was an important ceasideration-a. dicovery that the Americans are now endeavonriag to apply, and one that engaged his attentionunp to the peried of his death. Latelyhomade some discoveries ia optics, wlich werefollowed by the construction nf an instrument for testing thepurity o £ate r by the abstractiona of light-an instrument which has been lately used with succea in investigating the waters of the Thames. Another of his eontributions to seientific knowledge was a remarkably ingenious arrange. ment for obtaining and applying electric, power to machinery. He was one of the original promoters and dia{rmas of tho Polytechnic Institution. Me also originated and carried out, nearly 60 years ago, an extensive system of' arterial drainage,, embracing 4,060 &cs on the nqighbourhood of his Yorkehire estates, on a. pringiplo. previously unknown in ehis country. He was, we believe, between 40,and 50 ,years-since, one of the firs, if not the very first, promoters of the drainage and Improvements in husbandry which now so mach distinguish Lin. colnshire, where one of his estates w&a situated. He was also the first promoter and adopter of the cottap allotbdent system for the purpose of improving. the condition o£ the poor on his property.

LAW ZARPOBT. COURT OF ClaNCERY, LIXCoLN'S-nM. Dxa. 17 VA1rT)F.N V. JOfllK9- (Beforc aie LORD CHNCELLOR.) This appeal from a decree of the Master of the Rolls was PxIued a short time back and stood over for judgment. The tuit was Instituted by a creditor to set aside a post-nuptial 3ettlement of a sum of money, the property of the wife of Ute defendant C. W. E. Bazuett. At the time of the 3nasrriage the wife's property consisted of 1,0001. stock of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company standing in ber name, of which the certificate had been denosited .1oith her brother as a security for a loan of 2501. Before the marriage Barnett had- promised his intended wife and tier father that be would settle the property upon her, but the settlement was not made until after the marriage, on Vis representation that a post-nuptial settlement would be wqually good. From the evidence of the secretary to the railway company it appeared that the custom of the comrany was to transfer the stock of any fewale proprietor on L:tr marriage Into the name of her husband, upon his appli. cation and proof of the marriage and an affidavit of no settlertnt. Shortly after the marriage a settlement was executed, Jsyt which it was agreed that the stock should be sold, and that out of the proceeds the charge of 5001. should be first Vid, and that 5001. further part should be paid to trus*es therein named upon trust for the wife's sepa,sate use for life, with limitations over, and the balance was to be paid to the husband and wife. In Viursuance of this deed the stock was sold by the direc. tiens of the husband, the brother of the wife, and the trusLees of the settlement, and 500l. was immediately invested in Consols in the name of the trustees. After payment of Jhe charge of 2501. a balance remained of about 901., which whs handed over to the husband on the joint receipt of the liu'band and wife. The dividends of the stock pnrchased ! ith the 5001. w ere paid to the wife according to the settle- -net. They have since separated. At the time of the narniatge and of the subsequent settlement the husband Lad no property of his own, and he was indebted to the tilaintiff and various other persons. The Master of the 11s held thati the contract and the settlement were both void as aganst creditors under the Statute of Frauds and The Statute of Elizabeth (13, cap. 5), and made a decree in favour of the plaintiff. From this decision the wife appealed. The LORD CHIANCE.LOR now delivered judgment, and, after going through the facts, said that he entirely agreed vith tne deCsion of the Court below. By the Statute of Ysrauds it was provided that no agreement in consideration zf a marriage should be valid unless made in vriting, and th ref ore the ante-nuptial contract in the present case was vcid under that provision, As to the argument that the sar,amage was a part performance of the agreement, If it ,ould prevail the statute wrould bcecome simply ridiculous. lesettl(ment itself, therefore, being voluntary was void 3sagainst crediLos underthestatuteof Elizabeth, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs, although he came with yeluctance to such a determination, as the lady had been hardly used, WATSON V. ARGILE. This was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor tStuart. The question turned upon the construction of a rovenant entered Into by Samuel ArgUe (the late father of tIe plaintiff Mary Watson), whereby he covenanted with tho aid " Mary Watson, her executors, and administrators, that *he heirs, executors, and administrators of him, the said Samunel ALrgile, should within a reasonable time after the fleceases of him, the said Samuel Arglle, pay u.,to Mary li'atson, her executors or administrators, the clear sum of tiOOl. by and out of his real and personal estate and effects ;" sEd the said S3amuel Argue thereby charged the whole of liis real and personal estate and effects with the payment of (be said sum accordingly, and declared that In ease his perjonal effects should be insufficient to discharge the said sum £Df 5001e, and his heirs, executors, or administrators should refuse or neglect to raise and pay the same within a reason. *ble time, then and in that case it shoul-i be lawful for the 1,alntlff, Mary Watson, her executors or administrators, to .nter into and upon and hold and enjoy "all or any part of tgne real estate of him, the said Samuel Argile, wheresoever :stuate, of which he should die seized or in anywise bhneficially Interested," and receive and retain the rents thereof until the said sum of 5001. should be fully paid. The date ,Df the covenant was the 30th of August, 1837, and Samuel 'Argile died on the 26th of March, 1854, intestate, and the defendant was his personal representative at the date of the covenant. Samuel Argile was seized of more real states than at the time of his death, and the point raised lby the bill was whether the covenant attached to al the estates possessed by him in Aunust,1837, or only to those of wLich he died seized. The Vice-Chancellor held that all the real estates of Samuel ArgUe at the date of the cove:nant (August, 18:37) were charged with the payment of the EQOf., supposing the personal estate to be insufficient for thAt purpose. The defendant appealed. Mr. MalIms and Mr. Bevir appeared for the appellant; ilr. Bacon (Mr. Surrage with him) supported the decree. The LORD CI1ALNCEILLoi delivered judgmexnt, and said tbat the decision of the Court below was clearly wrong, and -lid not appear to carry out the intention of the Vice-Chan*;ellor. 7he question was whether the estates that Samuel Argile had parted with to his son between the date of the vovenant and his own death were charged with the 5001.; and upon that point the words of the covenant seemed to be r3onclusive, that Samuel ArgUe only intended to charge tbose estates of which "he should die seized," and to retain 1he absolute control over the whole of his property during LiS life. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to the account asked for, and to be paid the 5001. in full out of the pergonal estate left by Samuel ArgUe; and, in the event of that )rovlng insufficient, then out of the real estate Samuel Argile died seized of. The heir denied that Samuel ArgUe left any real estate, and probably that assertion was correct; but if the plaintiff desired an inquiry upon that point she .vas entitled to one, with the risk, however, of having to say the costs of the heir if umsuccessfuL The decree of the Court below would be varied in acoordance with a part of the prayer of the Bill, by making it in a creditor's suit utpon the terms of the present juagment, and the costs vuuid be reserved. (Before the LoRDS JUJSTICxS oP APPpAz,) DAWfSON V. PRINCE, This case, which was argued at the end of November, was placed on the paper for judgment. The very short point *;vas this :-The husband of Mrs. Dawson, a married lady, Esueing by her next friend, obtained a bill of exchange made payable to her, and which was endorsed with the name of rrs. Dawson (the penuineness of which was, howeyer, In ulispute), and Mr. Prince having also endorsed It and got it fiiscounted by Messrs. Overend, Gurney, and Co., Mr. Daw. 3on obtained possession of the money and appropriated it to his own use. When the bill feU due Mr. Prince, as an enilorser, paid the amount, and then sued the Royal Bank of 'A ustralasia, by whom the bill was accepted. To restrain this action Mrs. Dawson filed the bill claiming the money as part Df her separate estate under her settlement. The Master of the Rolls decided in the lady's favour, whereupon Mr. Prince rappealed, insisting uipon his legal title as a bonQ Jide holder of the bill for valuable consideration, Mr. Sdesi andf MrtVILLIEMR, for the plaintiff, supported )the decision of the Master of the Rolls, Mr. Follett and Mr. C. T. Simpson were counsel for the ppellantt; Mr. Cotton appeared.for the Australasian Bank, Their LORDSH11S were of opinion that MIr. Prince was a bond flde holder for value by reason that he had paid the amount of the bill; that there was no neglect in Mr. Prince )believing the endorsement of Mrs. Dawson to be genuine on the representation of her husband, and that the Court would tot carry the doctrine of oonstruotive noticoe further than it had heretofore been acted on by this Court, and they there. lfore held that Mr. Prince ought to be discharged from the mit, and that the decision of the Master of the Rolls should I,e reversed.

Browne and Gratton, extcutors of the late James Kindle Browne, a mortgagee under Charles Robert Thompson, who was mortgagee of Richard 9amnel M. Sprye, one of the original promoters and projectors of the London Necropolis Company, and the bill seeks specific performance from the present company Df an agreement dated the 1st of April, 1851, and made between Sir Richard Broun and Sprye io the one part, and the provisional trustees for the comJ)any of the other part, under which certain rights and iDrivileges were reserved to Broun an d Sprye. According lo the statemeans In the bill, Sir RiChard Broun and Sprye 'vere the projectors and promoters In 1849 of an intended rompany for the formation and establishment of a necroVolis and nausoleum for the general interment of the dead ,of the Metropolis. For this purpos they had entered into - contract with the Earl of Onslow for the purchase of 2,000 acres upon Woking.cornmon for 35,0D01., which was to be paid upon complete registration of the intended wi m- yt gotiations were also entered into with the Bouthesoern Railway Company for the reception and convey Df the doea bodies and the conveyance of funeral partieasto and from the monecronoiD uponx cerntai terms. The intended oompany was providIonally registered on the 7th of February, ISM, in the names of Broin, Sprye, Anderson, Thomso Gardiner, and Voules as Provisional directors, and ons the 31st of April, 1851, an mperent was entered Into between ,air Richard Broun ano Sprye, of the one part, and the ,ther four provisonal truste for the iatended company of Ibe other part.

It was also agreed that a lease of 225 acres of surplus outlying land, portion of the 2,000 acres at Woking, should be granted to Sprye and Broun upon certain torms. Shortly after the execution of this agreement the company was formed, and on the 27th of October, 1851, was completely registered. The deed of settlement was dated the 3d of October in the same year, but contained no recital of the agreement of April, 1851, the recital contained in the original draught having, according to the statement in the bill, been struck out by the Registrar of Joirt-Stock Companies recording to his usual regulations. In the session of 1852 an Act was introduced " for incorporating the London Necropolis and National Marsoleum Company, and to enable such oompany to establish a cemetery in the parish of Woking, in the county of Surrey, and for other surpoes.' Sir Richard Broun and Sprye objected to the aiin many particulars, especially that it did not contain any protection to their rights under the agreement of April, 1851, and succeeded in obtaining the introduction by the Lords of a saving clause (sect. 31), providing that nothing tberein contained should deprive any party of any legal or equitable rights, interests, or claims to which he might be entitled by virtue of any agreement with the persons acting for the time being as provisional trustees before complete registration, and any such provisional trustees shoubd ba held to have acted on behalf of the company, and as if the seal of the company had been affixed to such agreement at the date thereof; provided, nevertheless, that nothing contained in any such agreement should bind or enable the company to transfer or convey away to parties claiming thereunder any portion of the land conprised in the schedule to the Act, but that any claim should be treated as a question of pecuniary compeneation or damages only. Tho Bill received the Royal assent in August, 1852, and Is entitled " The London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Act, 1852" (15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 149). In 1854 Sir Richard Broun filed a bill against the compauy to enforce specific performance of the agreement of Aprzl],l851. The company demurred to the bill, but his Honour, in November, 1854, overruled thedemurrer. The company had subsequently put in their answer, but Sir Itichard Broun, having been arrested upon a judgment, had presented his petition in the Insolvent Debtora' Court. Mr. Sturgis, as provisional assignee, had declined to proceed wvith Sir Richard Broun's suit, which became abated from the insolvency. Mr. Sprye, in 1851, assigned bis 3,7401., secured by the agreemnent of April, 1851, to Thompson, one of the provisional trustees, and subsequentlya director, by way of mortgage. Thompson deposited this mortgage wlth James Kendle Browne as a security for moneys lent. Browne died in 1854, having appointed the present plaintiiE, Edward Browne and Joseph Gratton, his excu. tors. Spryo became insolvent, and in December, 18, an order was made vesting his estate and effects in Sturgis, the provisional assignee, and by a further order Thompson was appointed assignee of Sprye's estate and effects. Thompson himself subsequently became bankrupt. The plaintiffs, as claiming under Sprye, and representing his interests, which but for the hopeless abatement of Sir Richard Broun's suit would have been therein ascertained, had filed their bill against the company, praying specific performance of the agreement of April, 1851, so far as it could be enforced, and that certain accounts might be taken and payment to the plaintiffs of what should be found to be due to them upon their security. The defendants had put in voluminous answers, raising a variety of defences, which wil sufficiently appear from the arguments on their behalf. hlr. CARNS, Mr. GRMxE, and Mr. DAtfl,Em, for the plaintiffs, contended that unless the defendants could show that there had been an absolute release of all his rights under the agreement by Sprye, and before he had assigned his interests to the parbies through whom the plaintiffs clainied, the relief sought by the bil must be granted. They rehed upon the saving clause in the Act of 1852, the indgment of lis Honour overruling the demurrer to Sir Richard Broun's Bll, whioh was in paan mater-s, and the clear provisions of the agreement of April, 1851, from 'which the company could not now escape, Sir R. Broun and Sprye having duly performed their portion of the agreement, and the company themselves having recognized and treated it as binding up to April 1853. Xr. DANIEL and Mr. OSBORN1!:, for Samuel Sturgis, the provisional assignee, who had been made a defendant, suppborted the plaintiffs' case, and deprecated, in strong terms, the way in which public companies thought fit to repudiate their engagements, and, by the complicatMon of interests created by them, almost set at defiance the ordinary judicial ropcuessloias toe ,bXecome, In the words of Lord Eldon, Mr. Shapter, Mr. Fooks, Mr. Hardy, and Mr. Biron appeared for other defendants, but took no part in the argument. The AWrORNEo-G1Mxv RA, for the company, contended that the plaintiffs, as executors of the assignee of a mortgagee, had not such an interest as would enable them to sustain a suit frained like the present, or to represent the agreement of April, 1851, for the purposeof enforcing It against the company. Nor could the Court implement the plaintiffs' case by allowing them to use the aid of Sturgis, the provhional assignee, who had declined to adopt Sir Richard Broun's suit, already pending, which was properly framed for the purpose of enforcing the agreement, and in which alone could the questions raised be properly disposed of. Mr. Sturgis, however, wise In his vocation and cautious in his discretion, though declining the first suit, had chivalrously come forward to assist the present plaintiffs with 'what might be designated his funeral okation over the Necropolis Company. Then upon the merits,-the deed of settlement was itterly inconsistent withthe agreement of April, 1851, being in any way valid. The Act of 1852, which alone gave any colour to the case for establishing the agreement by the alleged effect of the saving olause which might bear the palm among Acts of Parliament for blundering uninteUllgi bllity of language) did not in reality assist the plaintiffs' case. The agreement 'was for a purpose which the Act treated as already accomplished-the purchase of land from Lord Onslow, effected in April 1852, and proved by the purchase deed to have been made to the company and on hehalf of the company. Itwas preposterous, therefore, to say that in 1852 the directors were to be at liberty to sustain a further contract with other persons for the identical thing already purchased, and to pay additional purchase:mnuey for it. Then with respect to the agreement itself, assuming the four provisional trustees to have had authority to contract, was it a prudent, discreet, and proper exercise of their powers, and not rather a fraudulent and collusive transaction ? Broun and Sprye were themselves provisional trustees, and had no power to bargain with the company, at the company's expense, through the medium of an alleged contract with Lord Onslow. They who purported to convey the benefit of their contract and Interest were found to have had no interest which they could convey. Lord Onslow had subsequently repudiated his negotiations with Broun and Sprye, and treated directly with the company, to whom the land had been conveyed, by whom the purchase money had been paid. The directors, by enforcing such an agreement, would have committed a breach of trust, while Sir Richard Broun and Sprye, knowing that the whole con. tract was fraudulent and collusive as far as the company wore concerned, were themselves disqualified from enforcing it or getting any benefit from it, according to the ordinary rule affecting all persons dealing with trustees, But further, assuming the agreement to be just, innocent, and honest, yet it could not be enforced against the company unless its provisions were distinctly brought to the notice of the share. iolders, all of whom had subscribed for their shares subse. quently to its execution. This had clearly not been done, the rosects bingsilnt ponthesubject. The subse. iuent conduct, too, ogf Sir UBroune and Sprye was adverse to their present contention, and disentitled them from the relief now indirectly sought on their behalf. For these reasons tthe bill was unsustainable, ad ought to be dismissed Mr. WILLCOCE followed on the same side, but had not concluded when the Court rose.
COU1RT OF QUBERNR M?.VPI1T -- -- lIULLS V. Rv1p1. (Sitngs at 7si P-Us b -fo-e Lord CA3- P L and i -PSIVI CUTurieLa) Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Prentice, and Mr. Woolletit were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. M. Chambers, Mr. H. James, and Mr. Tayler appeared for the defendant, This was an aotion for money had and received. The de. fendant ploaded nevor indebted and a set-off. Mr. E. J.LaS stated that the plaintiff was a farmer, re. siding In the county of Essex, and the defendant was an attorney, practising at HEalsted, and also agent to a loan society. The plaintiff hadisome dealings with him in that capacity, and the defendant found out that the plaintiff had a daughter living with a Mr. Smith, a wealthy farmer in the county. Defendant induced the unfortunate plaintiff to allow him to commence proceedings against Mr. Smith. He at once brought three actions-one for seduction, another for breach of promise of marrlage, and a third for slander,-without a letter or any application to Mr. Smith. Mr. Cutts, a solioitor, and a friend of Mr. Smith, Inter. fered, and at his suggestion an agreement was entered into by which Mr. Smith bound hiraself to mnarry Miss Hills within a period of eight months from that date. Mr Shepherd having become acquainted with this, at once instituted a prosecution against Mr. Smith and Mr. Cut's under the Bishop of Oxford's Act; the blls -were found, and the ease eventually came on at the Summer Asaises of this year, when it was thrown out of court. In the meantime the three actions had been going on. Mr. Smith was anxious to have the matter settled, and gave Mrs. Hills 501. for the purpose. She handed this to Mr. Shepherd, and he gave her a receipt acknowledging the money on aceount of his costs in the action for seduction. At that date his costs could not possibly have amounted to 61., and the plaintlff now claimed back the money as had and received to his use. The defendant had pleaded a set-off of 2151., his costs in the prosecution, but the plaintiff had given no authority for that proceeding. Mrs. Hills, the plaintiff's wife, was called.-We became acquainted with the defendant in 1856, and obtained a loau of 801., for which my husband gave a bil of sale of an his property. I have a dau hter Martha Augusta. She was then Hving with Mr. Smith, at Coleman's, about four miles from us. I told this to MIr. Shepherd, and showed him a paper my daughterhad got from MIr. Smith. He handed it to his clerk, Mr. Cardinall, who said he would look at it, as not a moment was to be lost. I replied, " Very well," as I was anxious to have my daughter protected. I did not know that MIr. Sheherd was about to bring an action until he called at my house o. his way back after serving the -wits, and did not even know wbat the actions were for. My daughter had been living with Mr. Smith for nine mQonths. I saw Mr. Shepherd in October, 1856. He asked use if I had any money. He said he would take 501. I asked for what, he said on, the action for seduction. I said It wasM Iag sumtbuathtd ha bed m a e 3oa receipt. He tod me ot t showthe rceip toayn b aftr -rot alete toMr Seperd~ taee Smith. [By the agreement Mr. Smith bound himself to marry Miss Hills within eight months; it provided that in the meantime she should live with him as before.] Mr. Smith married my daughter on the 24th of last April. I kept the agreement in my possession after it was signed. In November. 1856, Cardinall, defendant's lerk, came to m 3 and asked to see the agreement. I showed It to him. He forced it from me and took it away wit, him. Ee promised to return it the next day. Oa the 10th of December I received a letter from Mr. Shepherd, asking me and myhusband to meet him the next day and accompany him to Chelmsford, I had no ideawhatwe were to go for. We met him atBratntree Station; he said some gentlemen wanted to see us. When we got to Chelmsford hp took ns to the White Hart. I hai no Idea the assizes were going on. He next took us to th3 Town-hall. I asked him to let us go home; what did wa come for? He told me not to be impatient; I should sooa know. After he had been in the grand jury-room (as I suppose) about a quarter of an hour, he came out and told us to go in. We went in. I was asked if a paper produced wds the agreement about my daughter; that was al I told him what had passed. I had no idea why I went to Chelmsford. I went to the assizes in Maroh but the trial was put off. I went again at the Sammer Asdzes. My husband and I were at the Plough. He was in bed ilL Mr. Sherpherd came in and said he should go to the Town-hall, and told him he should say he was the prosecutor. My husband said "When I get into court I shall sneak the trath." I said nothing. Neither my husband nor 'was icourt, I never gave any instrction to Mr. Shepherd to institute the pro. secution, nor did my husband as far as I know. Cross-examined.-I used to vwrite my husband's letters. My daughter was 19 when she went to live with Mr. Smith. Be had promised her marriage before she went to live with him. She had known him about one year and 10 monthi before. He is about 56 or 58. My object 'wohn I spoke to defendant was to get her away from Mir. Smith. She eame away. She was not with me when the actions were brought. She was then at Halsted. I knew nothing of the action for seduction until I took the 501. to Shepherd. I had not then seen the agreement. It was Mr. Smith proposed it. I got the 501. from him some timne in October. I was not able to o to Shepherd for some days. I went on the 20th. I asked aim to date the receipt the 18th, lest Mr. Smith should want the money back, as he wished that he or his solioitor should settle the actions. I had seen MIr. Cutts before. He said Mr. Smith would give 501. to settle the actions. He said that if Shepherd took the 501. he would not tax the bll, but if he demanded 841. the bill should be taxed. There isa piece torn off the receipt that Shepherd gave me. (The paper was read:-" hM. A. Hills v. Smith. .The Same v. Blackburn.-I undertake not to demand any costs in these actions in case the defendant Smith shall marry Miss Hills within two months from the 7th of September last (the day she returned to his house). J. G. Shepherd."] I was not present when the agreement was signed, but I was at Mr. Cutte's the same day. My daughter came with Mr. Smith from his house. I endeavoured to persuade m7 daughter to come back to my house. Mr. Shepherd had given me directions to do so. Mr. Smith would not allow me to say;anytbing to Mr. Cutts about the proposal to marry in two months. I did not tell him. lr. Shepherd said it was most disreputable that my daughter should continue to live with him until they were married. He said he should fix his own tine, but he would not be dictated to by me or by Mr. Shepherd. I had impllcit confidence in Mr. Shepherd. He always urged on me to bring my daughter back. We remained at Cutts's two hours and a-half. Hle told me the agreement was being preoDared according to Mfr. Smith's wishes. He showed me the agreement. I had reviously asked him to let Mr. Shepherd see It. Mr. Smith said he would not allow him. I got the agreement from my daughter about a week after. She was at Mr. Smith's in December, 185G. In March she was near her confinement, and could not attend as a witness. Re-examined.-I took the 501. to Shepherd to pay his cotta and charges. I then knew nothing of the action of seduction. To Lord C.ALirBELL.-Mr. Smith gave it to me. He said Take the 501. to Mr. Shepherd; tell him everything must be discontinued as I am going to be married to Martha Augusta, but not within the time he said. I will fix my own time for the marriage." He gave me a 501. Bank of England note. Lord CA'iNrPBEnL said, he did not see how the action was maintainable. The money was Smith's, and he alone could claim it if it had been obtained under false pretences. Mr. E. JAMES said, he could supply further evidence. Mr. Evans, the plaintiff's solicitor, Mr. Cutts, and Mr. Smith were then caUed, but It appeared from their evidence that Mr. Smith had volunteered to give the money. Mr. J.mIEs then read a passage from the defendant's affidavit, in which he stated he had received no money from Miss MI. A. Hills nor from any of her friends on her account, but that the plaintiff, John Hills, had paid 501. expressly on account of the costs incurred by Mm in the action against Smith. Lord CAM-PBELL said, that altered the case. MIr. Evans was then recalled.-He said, only 51. 17s. 2d. was due on the 18th of October for costs In the action of seduction. I have never got any bilL The judge made an order for the delivery of the bill in the action for the breach of promise. I was present when the trial came on. The case was stopped on the opening of counsel. The only witnesses' names on the indictment were Shepherd and the two Hills. Cross-exaniined.-Mr. Hills Is my client in this action. My instructions were through his wife. I was attorney for the defendants in the indictment. The judge expressed an opinion that as Miss Hills was married to Smith she could not be called. The costs were not nllowed. I Mr. Cutta recaUed.-I had known Mr. Smith for many years. I knew the girl was living with him, and I prepared the agreement. She had one chUd, and was near her confiue. ment with a second. I did all I could to induce Smith to marry her, and told Shepherd so. The elght months was named because Shepherd had named an earher date. I told Shepherd he was not to see the agreement, but I would pay his costs. I did the best I could for the girL Shepherd preferred the indictment behind my back. The agreement 'was signed voluntarily. Cross-examtned.-The agreement'was signed'the day it bears date. The young girl never refused to sign It. She was pressing me to get it done. I can swear that the plaintiff; his wife, and daughter all saw the agreement at my office before it was signed. John Hills, the plaintiff, was then caUed.-He stated he never authorized the defendant to brine an action for seduction, and when the 501. was paid he dia not know it had been brought. He knew nothing of the prosecution when he went to Chelmsford. Cross-examined.-I might have said I would sell my shirt rather than let it drop. Air. CEAwBms addressed the jury.-He said, that something more than 501. was involved. The defendant's reputation was at stake. He had behaved most kindly to the Hills. They were for a time grateful, but had since turned against him. Hlis only desire had been to seoure the girl's marriage. He would show that the costs In the action for seduction amounted to more than 501., and that the pro. secution had been instituted under the plaintiff's express ins'ruction, and that he and his wife had approved every step taken. Mr. Julius Gaborian Shepherd was then called.-In June, 1856, the plaintiff's 'wife and daughter called at my office, and left me the papers connected with the transaction. At their express desire I commenced the two actions. Aftec that a number of interviews took place and several letters were written. (During the course of this witnesses exami. nation an imumense number of letters which had passed be. tween him and the plaintiff and his wife were put in and read. From them it would appear that he was in constan' communication with them on every part of the case, anu that at his suggestion they several times endeavoured to ge' their daughter away from Mr. Smith's house.) Mr. JAMEs.-Every one of these letters are charged In the bill delivered to Mrs. Smith for the breach of promise. Examination continued.-I went to London to have a conference on the case. On the 2d of September I told the plaintiff my costs amounted to 841. ; he said they ought to be 1001., as Smith ought to be made pay welL I said my costs in the action of seduction were 501. Cutts offered me 501. on certain conditions, which I could not accept. The conditions were that Miss Hills should return and cohabit with Smith and aU costs be paid. I said if the biUs were paid and she got the agreement I would forego the actions. I went back to the plaintiff's; he and his wife expressed their satisfaction at what I had done. On the 8th of September I got a letter from Mr. Hills, wrltten by Mr. Blackburne, directing me to cease the actions on payment of costs. I wrote on the 10th, stating I was ready to do so. On the 12th my clerk wrote, stating I would not take less than 841., anLd if I were to stay proceedings I should look to Hills and his daughter for the costs. I saw Mrs. Hills early in October, and she asked me if I would take the 601. in full of all. I said no; I would take it for the co3tz in the action of seduction, but if Smitb married Miss Hills within two montbs I would not ask for any more. She came on the 22d of October and brought the money, and asked, would I not take it in full of all demands. I said I knew my duty to her daughter, and I would not stay proceeding unless Smith agreed to marry her. She said she had told Smith it 'was paid, and she asked me to date the receipt on shel18th. A day or twvoafter Mr. Cutts 'wrote to ask 'whether I had received 501. in full. HIe took out a sumons to stav proceedings, On the summons I 'was ordered to deliver my bill of costs. I have had many interviews 'with the plaintiff. He never asked for my bill of costs. He never claimed back the 501. He always expressed the greatest satisfaction at my conduct. receivedinstructionn to prosecute Cutts and Smith. They came through my clerk, CardinalL Mrs. Hills told me she had got the agreement, and promised to let me see it. I sent my clerk. He brought lt back with instructions to take such proceedings as I thought proper. On the 9th December I saw Mrs. Hills and had a conversation with her en the subject of the indictment. I told her I thought the agreement rendered Smith and Cutts liable to an indict. seent. She told me that her husband had gone to Catts. and that they refused to sign any agreement without my sanction, and they left the house. They tried to persuads their daughter to accompany them, but Cutts and Smith prevented her;that she managed toescape, but Smithfollowed her. From her account I thought Mr. Smith and Cutts were clearly hable to an indictment. She told me to take such proceedings in the matter as I thought proper. I went to the magitrates' clerk the next day; he advised me that as the assizes 'were so near I should go at once and prefer au indictment. I came up to London the next day to consuit counsel, and he advised me the case came within the Blshop of Oxford's Act. I gave him instructions to prepare an indictment. My clerk brought me the indictment the evening before the assizes. I sent word to Hils and his wife to meet me. I went with them to Cheimsford and explained to them the nature of the entire proceedings, ani read a portion of the indictment. As soon as the bil wa; found I told them they might go home. Several letters passed between us afterwards on the subjectl Mr. Blood offered me certain terms, but, acting under Mr. Lush's advice, I refused them. He offered me 2501. for my costs. Hills gave me an acceptance for 1001. in respect of the'costs of the indictment. When the case came on at the summer assizes I went to Hills, 'who was il. I told him It 'was said he was not the prosecutor; he replied, " I will state that I am. I am deternined to go on and I will sell nmyshirt to punish them." The marriage took place in ApriL Mrs. Hills came to me to say that Smith wanted to take her daughter. up to London to marry her; I said she should not leave Hals:ed unless as his wife. He then married her at Halsted immediately. The biU is dated the 15th of May, 1857. I sent my clerk up with it, and he brought it back signed. I had made application for money on account of the prosecution. Mr. Hills said he should not be able to pay money. I have made up my biUl of costs in the prosecution ; I have paid 1201. out of pocket; in alU the proceedings I have paid between 2001. and 3001. I have never received anything but the 1001. bill and the 501. note. Cross-examined.-The bill was given on account of the costs. It is in my clerk's handwriting* it was given to the acceptor in blank. I discounted it inu tondon. I took it up. I swvear distinctly I did not ask Hils and his wife to put his name on the bill for my accommodation. I have never claimed the amount from them, I took it op the day it w as doe. To Lord CAPDBELL.-I expected Hills would Ultimately provide for it, but I doubted whether he would do so when iLt was due. Cross-examined.-I have put the bill of sale in foe; * the sale was with Mr. HilUs's consent. I have no connexion with any loan society. The sale took place on the 18th of August last. The day the biUl was due I received altogether 1341. The loan was 901. I made out an account of my costs in the action of seduction up to the 18th of October, amounting to 521. I have never delivered it. The letters aud attendances are very similar to those in the other bills. They are the identical letters and attendauces charged in the bills I delivered under the judge's order. I made out those bills with the intention of enforcing them. I wiU swear I did not claim from Mr. Blood the costs of the prosecution, 2151. and the other bill 2301. I do not find in my bilU any attendance at which I told Hills!and his wife of the prose. cution. I have no entry in my book of his authorizing the prosecution. Re-examined.-Hills and his wife came to me, and told me the landlord was about to put in a distress, and it was in consequence of that I put the bil of sale into force. I was then perfectly friendly with the Hills. They turned ronud on me Immediately after. Mr. Cardinal.-I am managing clerk to defendant. The charges in -the action for seduction are fair and reasonable. After the 501. was paid I went to Hills, and told him the money had been paid on account of his oosts in the action of seduction; he said he was very glad his missus had done so. I went over to Mrs. Hils after she had got the agreement; I heard her evidence as to that interview; her account is false ; she brought down the agreement, and I read it. Plaintiiff said "You had better keep it, Mr. Cardinall," I was aboout to put it in my pocket; she took It from me; her husbaud insisted on my having it, and she gave it to me on my promising that I would send her a copy. I sent it to her the next day. I told them I thought the agreement was void, the consideration being an immoral one. Plaintiff said it was aU of a piece with Mr. Cutts's conduct. I Paid I thought they were all liable to an Indictment for a conspisacy; he said he hoped so; he told me to do everything that was necessary in order to punish them in any we possibly could. When I came back I made an entry to that effect in the office book. I have had several conversations with plaintiff and his wife in reference to the prosecution. He has repeatedly made very strong observations to me on the subject. On the day of the wed. ding Hills told me that Smith had agreed to pay the costs of the prosecution, and that if I brought the bill to him he would get it settled. Smith himself told me he would pay all the costs. I told him we had no claim on him. I distinctly told Hills that the 501. was to clear his other costs. I was at Chelmsford, and heard the conversation at the Pleugb. Mrs. Hills's account is quite false. xr. Shepherd has stated exactly what occurred. Cross-examined.-I cannot refer to any entry which will sbow that it was communicated to Hils that he was insti. tuting tbis prosecution. Theitems in bils for the breach of promise and the seduction are almost always the same. Mr. Fitch. agent to plaintiffs landlord, stated he had heard Mrs. Hills say she had given instructions, and was de. termined to prosecute both Smith and Cutts. Mr. Neve, clerk to the defendant.-I took the bill over to plaintiff to be accepted. Mr. Shepherd's sienaturo was onit, hut the bill was rot fdled up. I told the p aintiff Mr. Shepherd wished him to accept the bill for the costs of the prosecution. He accepted it. I filled it up afterwards. He said at the time he wished Shepherd to go on with the prosecution against Cutts, at all events, but he did not wish to proceed any further against Smith. Cross-examined.-This was after the wedding. The bill is entered in the cash-book. Mrs. Hills was then called. I remember Neve coming to our house. He said, " { have a stamped paper from Mr. Shepherd." I asked what for. He said Mr. Shepherd sends his respects to you to say he is very short of money, and it would be kindness if Hills would sign it for 1001. I asked Neve what it was for. He said, " Nothing to do with you -only to accommodate MIr. Shepherd for a short time." My husband came home. He declined at first, but yielded to Neve's entreaty. He never said one 'word about the costs of the prosecution. Mr. Hills was also recalied.-H:e confirmed his wife's acof the tran,saction. Mr. Blood stated he saw Shepherd the day before the marriage, when he demanded payment of the bill, and said the marriage should not take place if he was not paid. He had offered. At the conclusion of this witness's examination the fur. ther hearing of the case was adjourned. SECOND COURT, (Before Mr. Justice EBRL. and SpecW Jurie.) P.ACKER V. WMtRBOTTo3L Mr. Powell was counsel for the plaintiff; the SolicitorGeneral and Mr. Huddleston appeared for the defendant. This was an action of trover to recover possession of a deed. The case had been tried before, and a verdict had for the plaintiff, which was subsequently set aside. It appeared from the evidence that In the month of September, 1855, the plaintiff, who resided in the vicinity of Tewkesbury, was applied to by a Mr. Thomas, a solicitor, carrying on business in that town, to advance a sum of money on mortgage. The result of the application was that the plain'tiff advanced a sum of 8001., simply at the time getting a memorandum as to the apportionment of the money on the three different properties on which it was to be secured. He subsequently caUed at Mr. Thomas's office and saw a deed of mortgage engrossed which was afterwards executed ; but, although he repeatedly asked to have it delivered into his hands, he was unable to obtain possession of it. He was ultimately informed that it had passed into the hands of the defendant, who succeeded Mr. Thomas in his business at Tewkesbury ; but,'although the defendant had acknowledged that the deed was in his possession, he had refused to give it up. It was further stated on behalf of the plaintiff that an offer of a composition at the rate of 10s. in the pound was made by defendant to plaintiff in satisfaction of the securities which were withheld from him. For the defence it was contended that the deed had never passed into the hands of the defendant, that he had never acknowledged It to be in his possesson, that he had care. fully searched through the papers in the office, but had been unable to find any such document, and that no offer of a compromise, as had been represented, was made on his part. The evidence adduced in support of this view of the case went to establish the fact that the defendant could have no interest whatsoever in withholding the deed, and that subsequently to his succeeding to the business of Mr. Thomas that gentleman had for some time constant access to the office. Mir. Justice EBLE having summed un The jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict for the defendant.
COURT OF COMMON PLEBA, DEC. 17. SECOND COURT. ;V-W.Tff! V WVA T-Z- (Before Mr. Justice CRESSwrLL and a Common Jurv.) Mr. Lush, Q.C., and. Mr. Petersdorff appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Hawkins and Mr. T. G. Clark for the de. fendant. This was an action to recover compensation in damages, and to vindicate the character of the plaintiff in consequence of a libel written by the defendant, concerning the plaintiff ia his trade. The plaintiff pleaded first "Not guilty," secondly, a justification, and that the words in the alleged libel were truein substance andinfact. Theplaintiff who is now a manufacturer of stamped muslins, and carries on business at 40, Watling-street, was formerly in the service of the defendant, a needle manufacturer, of 47, Gresham. street, as traveller. He remained for six years in that capacity, and then left the service of Mr. Walker for a short tinne, and re-entered it in June, 1855, as warehouseman. In 1856 Mr. Walker was compelled to take a quantity of stamped or embroidered muslins from a customer in lieu of cash. He employed his travellers to dispose of the same. The resmlt being favourable, the plain.tiff, being talented as a designer, thought he could improve his position; and it was arranged that the defendant should order the raw material in his own namae and pay for it, the material3 being forwarded to the plaintiff to manufacture, the plaintiff returning the material manufactured to the defendant, and charging the defendant with the price of the same, Mr. Walker debiting Mr. Wheeler with the amount paid for the raw material. The business turned out tca)e very profitable, the plaintiff stating the returns to have been 6, .na-year and t e profits 40 per cent. In September the defendant wrote to the plaintiff complaining that the sale of his needles was not so good as it had been, and that he contemplated making some changes in his establishment in London and removing the business to the works at Alcaster. A correspondence then took place between the parties, which terminated in the plaintiff giving the dofendant notice to quit. At the time the plaintiff had some inuslinunmanufactured lnhis possession; the defendantwrote requesting that it be delivered to him. This the plaintiff refused, stating that the defendant was indebted to him to the amount of 'll. 7s. 6d., after giving credit for the money paid by the defendant. Mr. Wheeler after this disposed of the muslins, and Mr. Walker made an application to the Lord Mayor at the Guildhall under the Metropolitan Pollce Act for a return of the goods; the Lord Mayor, however, declined to interfere, the value of the goods exceeding 1Oi Mr. Wheeler having commenced business on his own account, forwarded circulars to various persons, stating that he had been the sole manufacturer of the muslins sold by Mr. Walker, and that he was carrying on the business in Watllg-street. The defendant hearing of this forwarded a number of circulars to his customers, stating that the plaintiff was no longer in his employ, and was not author. izsd to transact any business on his account; that Mr. Wheeler had sent out a considerable quantity of cambric and other fabrics from Mr. Walker's stock for the purpose of conversion into embroidery patterns which he had refused to return to Mr. Walker; that Mr. Wheoler had engaged to sell this muslin against Mr. Walker's remon. I strances; that the value of the articles he had been in. formed at the police-court was much too large for the interference of the magistrate, who would otherwise have willingl assisted him; and that he was left to adopt other proceedags, as the removal took place when Mr. Wheeler was in his employ, but during his absence. The circular concluded by stating that Mr. Walker had established new machinery, and would be enabled to produce patterns at less cost than heretofore. The matter contained in this circular was the libel complained of, the inuendo being that the plaintiff was guilty of criminal misconduct and of dishonesty while in the defendant's service, and was dishonestly antd illegallyselling the defendant's goods. The plaintiff brought an action to reoover tbe sum of 91l. 7s. 6d, due by the defendant to him, which action the defendant settled by paying the debt and costs. Mr. HAWKILNS contended that the defendant was justified in sending the circular to his customers, Informing them of tho plaintiff's improper conduct, and for the protection of tbe lawful interests of the defendant. Verdict for the plaintiff,-Datmages 51. MA5iSDEN V. BARTLETT. Mr. Lush, Q.C., Mlr. Joyce, and Mr. Qcain appeared for the plaintiff; hIr. C. PoUlock and Mr. oloU for the defend. ant. In this action the plaintiff sought to recover damages sustained through the negUgence of the defendant's servants. It appeared that the plaintiff on Sunday, the 6th of September last, had a barge laden with dung under the shoot at Rook's-wvharf, Puddle-dock, Blackfriars, whick was removed by a lightetman of the defendant, who wished to place one of the defendant's barges under the shoot. It ap. peared that by the usage of the river it is the practice to remove barges when laden, taling care at the same time to see that they are afterwards safely moored. The barge in question, the Eclipse, was moored in the tideway, and at hligh-wvater on the turning of the tide drifted away and sunk belowv Sonthwark-bridge. The questlon in this cause was, whether defendant's man had properly moored the barge. E:vidence was given on each side, and ultimately a verdict was given for the plaintiff,-Damages 27l. 12s. (Siftings at Tisi Prius, at GuildhaU, before Chief Justfcc CoceBsuRN and a SpecoaZ Jury.) GREAVES V, RY AND ANOTHER. Mr. Scrjeant Byles and Mr. J. Browne appeared for the plalntlff, and Mr. Montague Smith, Q. C., Mr. Maude, and Mr. Beasley were counsel for the defendant; Mr. Wrey, Mr. Serjeant Shee, Air. Brandt, and Mr. Merewether for the other defendant, Mr. Crawford. This was an aetion brought to recover, as damages, the expenses which the plaintiff alleged he had incurred by reason of the fraud of the defendants inrepresenting the value of certain mining property, caUed the Little Down and Ebber Rocks estate, in the Mendip-hills, and so inducing him to go down to the spot and investigate the represeutations made, which turned out to be false. It seems that MIr. Wrey, the owvner of the Little Down, &c., property, had made a contract for the sale of it to a rnining company of vwhieh the defendant Crawford-was a member, and which took the name of the "LIdttle Dowvn and Ebbor Rocks Mining Company," and which had beon formed for the purpose of working this very property. The purchase money was to be 15,OOOL, and of this sum 1,0001. had been paid to Mr. Wrey, and a further sum of 3,0001. was to be paid m June, 1857. Some dialoulty arose as to the payment of the latter sum, and the plaintiff, who is the patentee of certain iron raUs and chatns of a peculiar construction, and who stated that he wvas weU acquainted with mines and minerals, baing anxious to set up some smelting works, either on his own account or with the assistance of a company, was introduced early in the present year to both the defendants, and the prospectus of the mining company, which spoke in hih terms of the rich state of the mineral wealth of the Mendip-hiUs in general, and the Little Down portion of them in particular, having been placed in his hands, he appeared inclined to treat with the company either for the entiro purchase of the property or for a large interest in it. Mr. Greaves, with the view of satisfying himself as to the truth of the allegations contained in the company's prospectus, visited the shafts which had been sunk once or twice, and felt favourably disposed towards concluding a bargain; but on a final visit which he made, accompanied by his attorney, by a Mr. Eddy, a manager of a mine at Ulverston, and by Mr. Wrey, in shaft No. 10 a wall was discovered, built up at the end of an adit of good ore, and alleged to have been placed thero for the purpose of deceiving the plaintiffand inducing him to believe that the mine was very rich in h<anamite, which was said to be the ore most sought after and valued by ironmasters. The defence was that no deceit had been practised, that the so-called wall of rich ore vras merely a hole about two feet square, communicating with another gallery, and built un with the materials near at hand without any intention ofrad to stop the draught of air circulating between one shaft and the other. It was also urged that the mlnes In question were really valuable and rich in iron ore, manganese, and other precious substances, and to prove this Professor Ansted and other sclentifio men were called, who proved very clearly that the terms of the prospectus were rully justified by the facts. It was also said that in any case the defendants, who were both examined, believed that anv statements they had made to the plaintiff were wefl founded. The trial occupied the whole of the day, and eventually the jury found for the defendants.
BANERUPTOY COUBT, Bajng7wjtrc, Dc, 17. Iy RE sNITTrr- TrTr.TP" A%T (-A (Before Mr. Commkssioner FA2NR.) The bankrapts, Francis Smith, James EiiUder, Tilden Smith, and George Sorivens 7ere bankers, of Hastings. Mr. LAWRANCE, on behalf of MIr. Scrivens, now asked for a certlficate of the highest class. The bank had made large advances to Mr. Richard Smith, a relation of the bankrupts of the same name. On the occasion of the bankruptcy of Mr. Richard Smith, perceiving that the public confidence in the bank had been considerably shaken, er. Scrivens, vith great propriety, suggested the closing of the bank after the smaaU amount of about 2,000L had been withdrawn. Under the judicious managemen t of Mr. Whitmore, official assignee, the estate had pdad 10s. in the pound, and a further dividend of from Ss. to 5s. in the pound might be anticipated. Whether, under an inspection out of court that sum would have been thus realized for creditors was a matter of doubt. M.r Scrivens having entered the bank as clerk 25 years ago had become a partner. His private estate showed a surplus of at least 5,0001., and in 1852 he had a clear capital of 9,4001. He snbmitted that no bankrupt was ever better entitled to a first-class certificate, and that one of that class should be awarded. Wise and honest men would thus learn that they had nothing to fear from the Court of Bankraptcy, although it had been recentlydescribed as being so obnoxious in a very high quarter. (Mr. Lawrance was understood to refer to some remarks by the Attorney-General in his place in Parliament.) The creditors of the bank included persons in every station of life, and not a single person complained of the conduot of Mr. Scrivens. The CoumissioNoEml-It is a very great satisfaction to me to know that under the auspices of this Court, and under the admirable management of my friend Mr. Whitmore, the official assignee attached to it, that a result so very satisfactory to the creditors as the receipt of a sum sufficient to pay 10s. In the pound on 150,0001., and the actual payment of such dividend to them, should have taken place. I have often had opportunities of observing and of knowing the value of the services of the official assignees generally, and more especially of the services of the assignees whom I have the good fortune to have attached to my court. I believe that on all occasions they perform their duty with the utmost ability. In this case Mr. Whitmore has done his duty with extraordinary success. So much for the general administration, Then, with regard to the question bfaore me, I think it is my duty to express not only my satisfaction vith, but also my admiration of, the conduct of Mr. Scrivens. It appears that Mr. Scrivens has, most unfortunately for himself, owing to the less correct conduct of his partners, ended a most honourable career with this stigma of bankruptcy, but If ever there was a person vho came before this ounrt to whom the stigma of bankruptcy can have no application it is Mr. Scrivens. He has led a life, I believe, of honesty, integrity, and economy. As regards his private affairs he does not owe one farthing. Every creditor has been paid, and instead of having boen a burden to the partners, it appears that there is a surplas of 5,0001. from his estate applicable to the payment of the general body of creditors. I therefore have the greatest possible pleasure in giving Mr. Scrivens what he is fully entitled to, viz., a first-class certificate, and in expressing my admiration of his conduct. A first-class certificate was next asked for by Mr. LAWv. R,ANCE on behalf of Mr. Francis Smith. Mr. Smith was solvent in July, 1852, with a surplus of 16,681L, although that surplus had been reduced by a loss of 10,000l. byja nobleman who was his debtor. The CozrtssroNEn.-I think the bankrupt is fully entitled to a certificate of the first class, and I have great pleasure in awarding such certificate. It was then stated that Mr. Eilder had refused to sien certain accounts, and that the ground of objection was thait the accounts showed him to be insolvent at the time of executing a certain settlement, and in which case the settlement would be void. The CoarsrrssroNER said, the bankrupt must be informed that if he refused to farnish a statement upon which he was prepared to abide, or refused to sign such statement, his examination would be adjourned sinc die, and proteetion be r3fused. It was perhaps but reasonable that he should be allowed the opportunity to hear wbat his son said on the subject, There would be an adjournment to the 5th of Febrnary with that object. The examination of Mr. Tilden Smith would bo adjourned to the same day. Adjourned accordingly. IN RE JOHN FREDERICK GOODERn.

INSOLVENT DRBTOBS' COUBT, Dcc. 17. _ . IS RE FREDERICK G. nRATLTV (Befare the Chief Commitsioner.) This case, wlhich was briefly noticed in our impression of yesterday's date, was resumed this morning. Mr. Reed appeared for three creditors, named Smith, Barton, and Stansfield. Mr. Sargood supported. Mr. Smith, resident surgeon to a dispensary in Star-street, Edgeware-road, stated that he was the holder of two bills of exchange for hO1. and 301., respectively, nt one and two munths' date, drawn by the isolvernt upon, and accepted by, one Jonathan Worrell Hinds. The bils were brought to witness in July last by a Mr. Charles Elliston Wilson, now a schoolmaster at Grays, In Essex, and witness gave caEb, deducting 5I 5s. for discount. Wilson represented the insolvent as heir to property worth 7,OOOl. a year, and Hinds as the son of a wealthy nian residing in Portland-place. Mr. Barton, an accountasnt In the Edgeware-road. was the holder of a 601. bill, drawn b the insolvent upon Hinds, whiclh he had discounted uponWilson's application, dedactlan 31. s. for discount. ,fhe insolvent, upon being examsined y, r. REEDj, stated that he was now 23 years of age. His father, who was th rector of a parish in the county of Antrim, IreaLnd, died in 1851, leaving four children, of whom he (insolvent) was the you6ngest. His mother was living, and had an income of about 2,0001. per annma. She had allowed him 4001. a-year, and he had held a commission inx the A^ntrm Rifles, a Militia regiment, which he had been compelled to resign in consequence of his aest. The first bl of exchange which be had accepted was one for 1201. in the hands of Mr. amansfeld. That bHl he accepted B i Dablin for the accommodation of Captain Fitzwarret Chichester, son of Lord Edward Chichester; and he did not know now where to find that gentleman All he got on haccount of the bol wzs 201., which Captian Chichester had previously owed him. About May last e became acquainted with Mr. Jonathan Worrea Hinds, and on the 27th of thet month he drew a bill upon that person for 1781. The object of that bll was to procure Hind's releatse frora prison, in order to enable Hoim to attend the Derby at Epsom. About the same time he put his navme to three other hls lr an aggregate amount of 2it l. Mr. Humphery Browm or bis assignees held one bill for 100Z., which had been given to Mr. R.A. B.Jennings (whose hearing was reported in Td dime,d of Wednesday last) to get discountedh and 801. was raised upon it, which was divided between the parties. For the 501. and 301. bils, on account of which Mfr. Smith the opposing creditor, gave 741. 15s., he (insolvent) only ot 201. from itowland, of which .Pol was in cigars, aud tlinds got the same. The bins were renewals, for which Mr. Rowland chartted 20 per cent, for two months, which was paid at the time. He knew nothing of Mr. Smith havins discounted those hivs until he was arrested, by him.

Barton, the present opposing creditor, war the detaining creditor on that occasion, and that.Mr. Saith, the other opposing creditor, had purchased some property belonging to Wilson, out of the proceeds of which 601. was paid to Mr. Barton. The insolvent proceeded to state that a bll, dated the 20th of June, now in the hands of a tir. H. Bingham, whom he did rnot know, had been given to Mr. Greatorex proprietor of the Prince of Wales Hotel, Lerc- erssquare, to get dis. rounted ; but he (insolvent) never received anything on account of it. He be.lieved that Hinds got a warrant for some cigar., Mr. Solemn Beyfus was the holder of a bil for mony drawn by the i olvent, and accepted by eunds, ded the 1st of uno. The insolvent said he received haf of the amount (',01.) in jewelry, which he did not beHieve to ba worth more than 351. A bill drawn on the 20th of Jane for 1001., now in the hands of a Mr. Perocole, had been given to one Kerry to get discounted, but he disappeared without returning the bill or handing over any money. A biU for 621., dated July the lst, was in the Lands of M1r. Thomas O'Keefe, to whom it was given to get discounted, but who had neither returned it nor paid over its value. Messys. Sowerby and Tattoo were the holders of a bill for 821., dated July the Ist, which had been intrusted to a man named Macbin, formerly the steward of the Prince of Wles Club, Leicesthersquare, to get discounted, bht which he depuieg with Messrs. Sowerby and Co. as security for a debt doe b Mr. Hinds, for which he (Macbin) was liable. The next bil was the 501., dated July the llth, hold by Mir. Barton which was the renewal of a former bill and which was dis. counted through a Mr. Rowland, of Alhanytstreet, who only paid 401. for the bin, and received is each from the insol. vent and Hinds for his trouble in negotiating the transMo. tion. Mr. Vivian O'Keefe received a bill for 1001. dated August the ist, to get discounted, but did not hand over any money nor return the bill, which he afterwards said he had lost. Mr. Robinson, a solcitor at Settle, in Yorkshire, held a joint promissory noe of insolvent, Hminds, andt onle WakeEman for 1001. and a bul dated August 17 for 116p., on accndtt of which insolvent received 471. 10s.

The case was adjournedauntil January 16th.
CENTWAL CRIAINAL COURT, Dec. 17. OLD COURT. (Bcforec Mr. Justicc CROV-DER.) Joseph Skinner, surrendered to take his trial upon an indictment for felony, in having, after being duly adjudged a bankrupt, failed, omitted, and neglected to disclose the whole of his estate, with intent to defraud his credi-ors ; and Thomas Skinner and Mary Anne Skinner, the brother and mother of the first named defendant, the latter apparently a very aged woman, and who was stated to be more than 80 years old, and George Thomas Franklin, who also surrendered, were charged on the same indictment with having unlawfully incited and aided the first-named defondant to commit the offence alleged against him. Serjeant BalLantine was specially retained (with Mr. Sleigh and Mr. T. Salter) to conduct the prosecution, which was instituted by direction of the Court of BankruptcyMr. Metcalfe and Mr. Poland appeared for the defendants. Serjeant BALLANTINE at the commencement of the proceedings admitted that there was no case against the three last-mentioned defendants, and verdicts of Not Guilty were therefore taken so far as regarded them, and the case sgainst Joseph Skinner was alone proceeded with. The charge was framed uuder the Bankruptev Act of the 12th and lth Vict. cap. 106, sect. 251, which enacts among other things that if any person after having been duly adjudged a bankrupt shall omit to discover any property belonging to him with a view to defraud his creditors that act should amount to felony, and subject the party convicted of it to the penalties for that offence. The case ap. peared to be one of a peculiar character. The defendant was represented to be an auctioneer and appraiser, and to be possessed of considerable property in houses at the east end of the town, and it seemed that he became bankruat in June, 1S55, and received a third class certificate in March 1856. This, however, was not the bankruptcy that was the subject of inquiry on the present occasion, and it was merely introduced into the case to show that he had not, under that bankruptcy, made a full disclosure of his property. The other evidence was of a somewhat complicated character, but it appeared that on the beginning of the resent year some dispute arose between a person named D)aniels, who occupied a house in Old-street, which was represented to be the property of tbe defendant, and an action was brought by Daniels to recover damages from the latter for assault and an illegal distress. This action was t-ied In February last, and resulted in the jury giving a verdict against the present defendant, with 5014 damages, which, with the taxed coets, amounted to nearly 1501. Daniels, according to the case for the prosecution, finding he could not obtain his damages or costs, and being unable to find the defendant, petitioned the Court of Bankruptcy to make him a bankrupt on the 5th of March, and shortly afterwards he was duly adjudged a bankrupt. Daniels, it appeared, was now out of the way and could not be found, and according to the balance-sheet of the defendant he was his only real creditor, and his debt consisted merely of the damages and costs arising out of the action, the allegation against the defendant being that he had assigned certain house property to his father and mother with a view to prevent Daniels from obtainingany benefit from his verdict. Mr. Justice CROWDER, after the case had proceeded some length, upon an objection taken by Mr. Metcalfe, said it appeared to him that there was no legal evidence of any act of bankruptcy having been committed by the defendant, or any proof of the petitioning creditor's debt, both which he considered essential to be proved in order to support the present charge. Daniels was the only creditor, and not for a debt under the ordinary acceptation of tho term, but merely for damages upon the verdict of the jury in the action for trespass; he was the trade assignee andevoryathing and he was not present to give evidence or any information upon the subject. Under these circumnstances he said it appeared to him that it would be useless to proceed further with the evidenco when the case for the proseoution failed in these material points. The jury, therefore, under his Lordship's direction returned a verdict of Not Guilty. NEW COIURT. (Before thc RECORDE,) Frank Valentine Saunders, a respectahblelooldng young man, in the uniform of a Custorms tidewaiter, ploaded '" Guilt-" to an assault upon John Harding Mr. 1IBTON, whho appeared for the defendant, urged that his client now regretted the act which, in a moment of excitement. he had committed.

James Lane, 32, traveller, who pleaded " Guilty " on Wednesday of embezzlement, was brought up and sentenced to eight months' hard labour. David Brown, 30, was indicted for unlawfully and wilfully fixing and placing a certain forged and counterfeit plate upon a hackney carriage, resembling the Stamp-office plate by law directed, kniowing sach plate to be forged and counterfeited. He was also indicted for having stolen two pecks of oats, the property of Charles Mlands. Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Cole appeared for the prosecution on behalf of the Board of rnland Revenue. The prisoner was given into the custody of Thomas Dyment, 417 A, on the 5th inst., on the charge of stealing the oats, the prosecutor being a cowkeeper. &e., in Rheidol. terrace, Islington, upon whose premises he kept a cab. From inquires subsequently made the constable found that the number plate on the cab was a false one. The prisoner admitted that it was not a genuine plate, but asserted that he had only hired the vehicle, positively refusing, however, to say from whom. The prisoner was found Guilly, and The CoU;r sentenced him to be kept to hard labour for 12 mionths. (Before Mr. CnEmtsy.) Three young men, named Briani, Shea, and Lucas, were brought up for judgment. They were convicted on Wednesday of robbing a private in the Grenadiers, William Ohandler, of his Crimean muedal, at the door of a publichouse in WhitechapeL They were " known " to the police and prison officers, and The COUIRT sentenced each of them to three years' penal servitude. Edwiu Raines, 15, and Henry Faulkner, 48, beershop. keeper, were indicted for stealing a pound of hops, the property of Edward Brodie, the msaster of the first named prissoner. Mr. Way prosecuted; Dr. Cooper and Mr. F. II. Lewis were for the prisoners. The jury found thenm Not G4ilty. Daniel Davis, 17, and Jarmes Dacey, 18, were convicted of stealing a snuffertray and other articles, the property of Jobn Smith. This was an ordinary case of stealing in a dwellinghouse. A number of convictions were proved against Dacey-his last sentence being 16 months. He was now sentenced to four years' penal servitude. Davis, whose character wvas more favourable, to 1S months' hard labour. William Spencer, 23, a ticket of leave man, was indicted for feloniously assaulting William Peek Lenoa with intent to rob him. [&Tho prosecutor went to a publichouso where dancing was going on, at the rear of Shoreditch Church, and got in the company of the prisoner. As they stood in the street, about to part, the prisoner seized him by the throat with both hands, and nearly strangled him. His throat was pressed so tHghtly that he could neither see, hear, nor call oat. A woman, who] evidently had been following them, ran up to the prosecutor and seized both his hands, and the prLsoner Said to her, " Hold tight, Polly." At the same moment an attempt was made to get the prosecutor's watch from hts pocket, but after a desperate struggle he threw them both off, and the -nan ran away. Ile got hold of the woman, who, however, very q'uickly twisted herself out of his grasp, and escaped. The prisoner was recognized while in custody spon another charge, and his identity was fully proved by the evidence. The jury found hiuii Guilty. Sentenced to six years' penal servitude. Two well-dressed young men, well-known miembers of the swell mob, were convicted of robbing a lady named Letitia Martin of her purse, at Tottenham. 'Ihey were found Guilty and senteneed to three years' penal servitude each, William Jackson, 30, was indicted for unlawfully assault. ing Thomas Morse, and also for assaulting Thomas Leather and another police-constable in the execution of their duty. Mr. Digby appeared for the prosecution; Mr. l'oland for ths prisoner. On the evening of the 21st of November the prisoner and several companions went into the City of Chester publichouse in BunhiUl-row, for tho purpose, there was every reason to believe, of creating a disturbance. The landlord (Mr. Morse) desired the prisoner to leave; he refused to do so, and in consequience the sergeant and the constable on the beat wero sent for. The prisouer mado a desperate attack upon the landlord, whom he kicked in a most das. tardly manner, the result being so serious that he had only been out of his bedroom twice since; and on the polico laying hold of him he turned upon them with the most savage violence. The sergeant he almost strangled, and the constable was severely bitten on the right hand and in. jured in the knee by a tremendous kick. All three were attended by Mr. Mather, the divisional surgeon, and were still under his care. Two witnesses were examined for the defence, and they endeavoured to make out that the prisoner was the aggrieved person, and that he committed no assault at all. The jury found him .'uilyl generally, and lIr. CREAsiY, after commenting upon the savago bni. tality of the prisoner's proceedings, sentenced him to two years' hard labour.

WINTER ASSIZES. . WESTrEN CIRCUIT. EXETER. DEC. 16. (BReore Mr. Justice WmuLss.) Jonathan Roose was indicted for feloniously assaulting Jane Stone, and causing injuries dangerous to life, with inten' to kill and murder her, at Torquay, on the lth of November. Mr. Carter and Mr. Bere were counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Coleridge for the prisoner. It appeared that tho prisoner, who was 21 years of age, lived with his uncle Max. Mitchelmore, who was a wine aud spirit merchant at Torqunay. The prosecutrit, Jane Stone, who would be 20 years of age to-morrow, had lived in ser. vice at Exeter, but about Christmas last she went to live as servant with gm Mitchelmore. After some time familiarity commenced between the prisoner and Jane Stone, and in the course of a few months she told the prisoner that she was In the familyway. He asked her if she was sure of it, she said she believed it. He asked her if she would take some medictne, and hefetohed her four pils, which she took. Some weeks afterwards she again told him she was in the familyway. He begged her to put it off upon another. She said she could not, for she had known no other man. He then earnestly urged her to put it upon his unole °r any other person. She however refused. On the 5th of August she lefther place and went and visited some friends, and on the 15th of August she entered the service of a hirs. WViles, at Warleigh-cottage, at Torquay. The priso. ner occasionally wvent to that cottage with wlne and ale for Mrs. WiUes, and upon ono of these occasions she told him she wanted to speak with him about the child that was coming, and they were to meet for that purpose. On the 11th of November, afser she had done her work, with the permission of Mrs. WiUes, she went to see her aunt, who lived about a quarter of a mile off. She remained there tiU a quarter before 8, when she left. On her way home she met her uncle, and they talked for a few minutes together. She got to Mrs. Willess cottage at 8 o'olock, ani after she had rung the bell the prisoner came up to her aad said, " Jane, I want to speak to you now." She answered that she would conie out again as soon as she could, but as she had rung the bell she must go Indoors first. The door was then opened and she went in. A stonemason named Lemon was in the kitchen. She Spoke to him, and then went upstairs, remained only a short time, and then returned to the kitchen. Lemon gave her some directions about the flue, but he thought at the time she was not psying attention to what he was saying. Lemon was then leaving the house. Jane Stone opened the door and lighted him out, aind wished him good night in the garden. The girl then looked about the garden for the prisoner, but could not find hlm in the front garden. She then weut up some steps into the back garden, and there she found him. There was a light then shining upon them from a window of the cottage. The prisoner put his arm round her waist and led her to a dark part of the garden. As they were walking along the girl said, "I suppose you think I have got all right nowt" He said he thought so, but she said she was not right-she was in the familyway, and she must go into the union, for she had no money. The prisoner, with that selfishness which he had previously exhibited, not caring at alU for the poor victim of his passion, said, " Then it Is a done job for me." The answer of the girl was, " It wiU be a pretty deal worse for me." They had angry and wrangling words. He then removed her into a darker part of the garden, further from the house, and then, wlthout saying anything to her, he put her down on the ground, and with his knee leant upon her left side with great force. He thrnst his hand down her throat as far as he could, and with the other hand he pinched her nose, so as to 'prevent her breathing. She attempted to bite hishand, which he thrust stil further down her throat. She struggled as much as she coild, and with a great and almost dying effort she uttered a slight scream-that little soream was heard, but not by human being, except the wretched villain. Her senses reeled and she became unconscious. In Mrs. Willes's house a little pet dog was kept, and, although human ear had not heard that faint scream, that little dog was roused,-it commenced barking most violently, scratched at the drawinroom door where the ladies were sitting, and could not he pacified. Mrs. Willes, and MIrs. Crawford who was with her, became alarmed and went into the garden. They called out, but received no answer; but they thought they heard the moans of some one in distress; they then went to the house of a neighbour named Hammersley, and he with a candle proceeded to the spot whence the moans came, and there he saw the body of a woman lying on the ground; she was making a low moaning sound. He looked at the face, but it was so beaten and bloody that he could not recognize the features. Hle went and obtained further assistance, and he returned with some other servants, but they could not recognize her. One of them, however, said " Jane," and she answered in a low voice, "Yes." She was asked who had committed the injuries, and she faintly told a name. The poor girl was then removed into the cottage, and the pollee and a surgeon were sent for. She was then taken to the Torbay dispensary. As she had mnentioned a name the prisoner was sent for, and was found at his mother's. He was also taken to the dispensary. On arrival at the dispensary the girl was examined, and it was the belief of the surgeons that she had not many hours to live. It was therefore thought proper for the purposes of justice that what was supposed would be her dying declaration should be taken, and a magistte and an attorney were sent for, and in the presenee of the prisoner she named him as the person who had committed the injuries. The surgeons proceeded to examine the unfortunate girl's head and face. They found eight lacerated wounds about the head and face ; there were two fractures of the skull over each eye; a fracture of the uppr jaw and the lower jaw; the lip was slit, the nose broken and flattened on the face, and the whole h.4d and face were such a mass of bruises that with a sponge al the flesh might have been swept from the bones. It was not imagined pos. sible that she could recover, but by extraordinary care and attention she lived, and to-day stated the facts wo have narrated up to the time of her becoming unconscious. She presented a dreadful spectacle in court-her face and head bad the appearance of being completely bound together, or rather mashed, with plasters. In cross-examination an attempt was made, but unsuccessfully, to show that there had been a struggle between the two parties. After the girl had been attended to, the magistrate and some other persons went to the garden and found pools of blood in it. They also found two stones which were covered with blood and human hair, and it was ascertained that these two stones had formed one stone, 91b. in weight and a foot In length, and it was evident that with that stone the injuries had been infiicted, and the stone had broken in two pieces. From the face of the poor girl bits of stone were taken. At the spot by the blood there was a distinct footmark, The shoes of the prisoner were brought, and the left shoe completely corresponded with that footmark. There was mould upon the shoe similar to that in the garden. There was isothing particular in the shoe. It was the shoe of a small man, and not one that a labouring man would buy. Several witnesses were called, who swore to the above facts, but we give the evidence of the surgeons in detail. Mr. Goldstone.-I am a surgeon. I was caLed in and saw the girL My first impression was that it was a dead body, but discovering a feeble pulse I gave her some stimulant. Her mistr.ss wished her to be removed to the dispensary, and I acquiesced in her wish, and she was removed there. Mr. Stabb.-I am house-surgeon at the dispensary. Jane Stone was brought in. I found her head, face, and chest covered with blood, and found eight lacerated wounds and four fractures, two on the head and two on the face. The bones of the nose and upper jaw were fractured; the teethl were loose; I removed them with my fingers. The lip was cut through; the ears were both lacerated. I removed a small picce of stone from the left temple, :n which it was imbedded; it was of the same description as the large stone. She was in a very dangerous state; we had not much hope of her recovery. I have been in constant attendance on her ever since. She must have lost a great deal of blood. We aroused her to consciousness, when she answered questions -nd I examined the prisoner's hands. There was an abras'on on the knuckles of both hands; the skin was knocked off. It might have been done by the teeth of a person. The injuries on the face and head might have been produced by this stone. Cross-examixed.-If she had been knocked down and fallen on a stone one wound might have been produced, but here there must have been several distinct blows. The prisoner came in with his uncle. Re-examined--All these wounds could not have been caused by one or two faUs. Mr. COLERIDMCz addressed the jury for the prisoner.- They had been familiar for some hours with the sickening details of this most atrocious act. They had seen the victim of it, and they no doubt were full of indignation against the perpetrator of the act, They most kindly had formed their opinion before they came into the box, but he knew 2a far as they could they would decide according to the evi. dence they heard to-day, bub the-y--o-uld-n'o~t le`ave`the'ir' human aature behind them. His duty was therefore most peculiarly difflcult. Juries were in the habit of favouring a prisoner and caught at the slghtest thing to save his lifehutthis was not a case of thls kind nor should it be-he called only for justice. He must deal with the facts as best he could, but he asked them to mete out to the prisoner thatjustce whichtheywould themnselves expect. He did not intend to dispute that on that night the prisoner was in that garden and met the girl, and that he was the author of the injuies which had been detailed to them that day. Had not Jano Stone been here all the rest of the case would have been dust and rubbish. Jane Stone must know the truth, and if she was to be believed the other parts of the case were nothing. The only question was whether she was perfectly certain that the prisoner was the man, but he did not feel that there was anything in the case which could justify him in asking them to say that the prlsoner was not the man; he could not ask them to disbelieve Jane Stone; he could not put before them a true or just reason why they should disbelieve her. What then was the defence he was to place before them ? He disputed that there was the murderous intention to do this inujry. It was the result of an ungovernable access of passion, which carried from him his reason, which must haunt him to his dying day. Thiey must be satisfied that there was the actual deliberate intentionto takeaway thepoorgirl's life. Was there from the first to thelast anything to induce them to believe there was this intention? The whole garden was not larger than the courtnot larger than some men's dining tables, and was that the place a man of education would have selected as the place in which he would commit a murder ? Did they ever heir of a man who had made up his mind to cotamit a murder by violence picking out sach a place for its commission? Had the man gone armed to the place? Did he go there with an intention of getting rid of the childt When he went there he was not certain that she was vith child, because at different times she had doubted it. The motive, therefore, was disproved by the evidence. If the death of the girl had occurred he submitted that it would not bave been a case of murder, and, therefore, the jury would not now be justified in convicting the prisoner upon the first count of the indictment. It was an udnfortunate assaultcruel if they would-outrageous if they would-but it was not with such an intention as wonld justify his life being taken, or that would support the first two counts in the indiotment. le would not ailow that there was the intention to do grievous bodily harm. The access of passion prevented amanhavinganyintention,andheurgedthatthis wasa case of sudden accessof passion, and that theonly verdict they would g've would be thatofunlawfully wounding. He asked them to send the prisoner home to his family and to his mother, of whom he had hitherto been the pride and ornament, that, by a life of penitence and repentance, he might in some way atone for one moment of unhappy passion. Witnesses were called, who gave the prisoner a most excellent character. Mr. Justice WILLEs then summed up. The prisoner stood charged in the indictment, consisting of three counts; the first was, that he committed the assauIt with intent to kill her; the second was to the same effect; and the third was, that he intended to do grievous bodily harm. He should lay down the law to them, as he did not agree to that which they had heard from the learned counsel. There was no doubt that it was necessary, in order to find he had an intention to murder, that they must be satisfied that the intention existed in the mind of the prisoner, either from some circumstances in the case, or from the character of the injuries inflicted; but he would say most emphatically-and he said it deliberately- that it was not necessary that there should be an intention formed beforehand to take away the life. If a person upon a temptation arising or an occasion presenting Itself suddenly formed the intention-if he inflioted blows accompanied by such an intention, the offence charged was made out. It was not necessary that there should be forethought or deliberation ; it was only necessary that the blows should be given with such Intention; it would be monstrous if it were not so. If they were satisfied he had the intention of taking away life they ought to find him guilty, even if they thought he never had It in his mind until he had the opportunity of doing so in the garden. If they were satisfied that at the time the prisoner struck the blows he must have had the intention of taindg away the life they must find him guilty on the first count. If they were not so satisfied, but that from the character of the transaction he must have intended to do grievous bodily harm, he was guilty upon the third count. If they thought he had no intention at all, then they would find hinm guilty of unlawfully wounding. The jury retired for a short time, and then returned a verdict of Guilty, with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mr. Justice WILLES then addressed him,-You have been found guilty of wounding this young woman with the intention of doing her grievous bodily harm. You repaid the kindness you received from your uncle by endeavouring to get the girl to pass off the child upon him, and on the 11th of November you assaulted her with a murderous weapon, in a murderous manner; you inflicted upon her many wounds with that frightful stone. You appear previously to have borne a good character, wholly unde. served, and it is evident you were exceedingly desirous of getting rid of your shame, and you must have followed some instigation of the devil. You have placed her in a position of being for life anobject of comiseration andhorror. No one can help feeling that the man who inflicted those in. Juries is a terrible example of bad leonduct, and that the offence should not be passed without condigan punishment. I do not know whether my indignation for you or my feeling of commiseration for that unhappy woman preponderates, The sentence of the Court is, that you be kept in penal servitude for the rest of your life. The prisoner was led from the dock in a state of perfect prostration. The case has excited the greatest interest, and the court was densely crowded.
OXFORD CIRCUIT. STAFFORD. DEC. 16. (Before MIr. Baron MAxRTN.) A t tho sitting of the Court this morning several prisoners 'who had been. previously covicted were brought up and Bentenced to various periods of penal servitude, ranging from 3 to 20 years. The case of William Mackindray excited considerable in. terest. He was a stout muscular hay, of about 14 or 15 years of age, and had been convicted upon an indictment which charged him with assaulting and robbing a little boy named Alfred Harrlson, on the 4th of August, 1857, at Fenton. The prosecutor, a sharp little fellow, of about eight years of age, but who was scarcely big enough to be seen above the witness box, stated that he got his living by playing the fiddle, and that on the day in question he asked the prisoner the way to Burslem. The prisoner undertook to show him the way, but, instead of doing so, he took him into a wheat field, where he knocked him down and kicked him twice tiUl he 'was senseless. He then robbed the poor boy of his fiddle and a few halfpence which he had- and, after tying his hands together, threw him into a' ditch, where he left him for the night.. Fortunately the next morning a farmer happened to come Into the field, and discovered the plight in which the poor child was, and released him. The prisoner was soon after taken, and the case being clearly proved the jury without hesitation found him GuiZty. Being now brought up for jadgment, Mr. Baron MARTIN said, the prisoner had been convicted of one of the most atrocious acts of which ho had ever heard. He had knocked the poor boy down and kicked him in the most cruel manner till he was senseless, and, but for the farmer's coming into the field the boy would have perished. His Lordship then sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for 18 calendar months, with hard labour. Oharles Dale, aged 32, a fitter, had been convicted of being one of a party which had committed a burglary in the dwelling house of Amos Richards, on the 11th of September, 1857, at West Bromwich. The burglars had carried off as much as 681. in gold, besides jewellry and wearing apparel, but none of the property had been found except some trifling article which had been found on the prisoner, and connected him with the burglary. When taken into custody the prisoner, who was a ticket-of-leave man, gave information to the police respectlng his confederates, but none of them had been taken. When called up to receive judgment the prisoner, who was not only a good mechanic, bat also a man of an acute mind and good education, read a long and ingeniously composed statement to the Court in mitigation of punishment. He stated that he was a ticket-of-leave man, and that whven he had obtained his liberty he got employ. ment in his business as an engineer at Bristol, where he was earning from 21. to 31. a week. Some person, howeve-, gave information to his employer that he was a ticket-of. leave man, and the consequence was he was discharged. He then went to Birmingham, and being in want he fell fi with men of his own class in that town, and lived with them. In the result he joined with his companions in committing the burglary of which he had been convicted. He said that as soon as he was arrested he had given information to the police as to the whereabouts of his confederates, and if the police had been sufficiently prompt they might have taken them all and recovered the gold. The prisoner then went on to argue that the Court might safely set him at liberty, or give him a mild sentence, for, after turning against his old cempanions, it would be utterly impossible for him to return to his old course of life; these was a freemasonry among felons, and now that he hadtnrned againstthem they would no longer tolerate bim in their company. And so it would be with the receivers of stole n goods; instead of receiving what he had to sell, they would think it was a trap laid for them, and would give him in charge. The prisoner gave it as the result of his experience that he was ha ppier in a convict cell than in the most splendid saloon in Birmingham. Having read over his address, the prisoner looked up at the leamed judge and waited to see the effect he had produced. Mr. Baron Mmuix reminded the prisoner that he wes one of a gang of burglars who had broken into the prose. outor's house in the night-time, and stolen 681. in gold, and also other property amounting in all to 1131. Hiis lordship had no doubt it was quite: true, as stated by the prisoner, that when it was known to his fellow wcrkmen that he had been transported he was shunned by them. The prisoner, however, could not complain of that, for It was one of the natural consequences of crime, and ought to be considered by people before they commit crimes. With respect to the prisoner's being in want, his lordship said that happily in this country no man need want the necessaries of life; but if the prisoner would join a gang of burglars and steal property to such an amount, he must take the consequence. His lordship then sentenced the prssoner to 20 years' penal servitude. The prisoner was then removed, hut as he was being taken a.way he said be thought he should live 20 years. Robert Davis, aged 23, miner, and George Jones, aged 23, miner, were chargedwith assaulting and robbing Richard Cleeton, on the 13th of September, 1827, at BQston. Mr. Kettle appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Cook Evans defended the prisoners. This was one of 17 cases of garotte robbery -which have been trled at these assizes. It appeared that the prosecutor Was what is alUed in the mining districts a "whimsey man," employed to take caro of the engine which raises coal from the pits. On Sunday, the 13th of September, he had been to a funeral at Wolverhampton, and on his way home stopped at a publichouse, aud had part of half a pint of gii. He started for his homeat about 10 o'clock at night, and had to pass down Ettingshall-lane, familiarly known in the district as "H Rell-lanoe, When he got near the canal bridge two men came behind him quietly, and one of them who was taller than the other seized hold of him round the neck tiU the blood gushed from his nose and mouth. The shorter man then came in front, struck him in the belly, and rifled bis pockets, taking a silver wateh, 3 sovereigns, and 3 or 4 shillings. The men then kno cked him down on the ground and decamped. The prosecutor cried " Murder," and presently met a policeman, who was on duty in " Helllane," at a place called " Catch'em's-corner," and described the man who had robbed him as having a thin face and a bllUy-cock hat, A boy named Charles Roberts, who was welting at the corner of Pump-street, which goes into Hell. lane, told the prosecutor that he had seen the two prisoneis go in that direction at half-past 10 on the Sunday nght ; and on the Tuesday following the prosecutor heard that the father of Jones, the shorter man, wanted to speak with hins. He accordingly went to see Jones's father, and while he was at the door the prisoner Jones came up. The proseoutor then went away to the police, and said he had found the man who had robbed him, and gave instructions to have him apprehended. This was accordingly done, and, as there was no doubt that both the prisoners were together in Pump-street at about half-past 10 on the night of the robbery, Davis also was arrested. It further appeared that, after Jones had beean taken into custody, Jones's brother had paid the prosecutor 41., saying he could not get the watch, but he would pay its value. This money was accepted by the prosecutor, on the understanding that he was not to swear to the prisoner Jones, but whon the proseoutor got Into the box he positively swore that Jones was the man who bad taken his money and watch, and that he knew him by his thin face. The prosecutor was cross-examined to show that he was drunkc, and that his belief as to the prisoner Jones's identity was owing to the information which he hAd received, and to the payment of the money by the prlsoner's brother. At the close of the case, Mr. Baronl MA-TIN said, there wag no case against Davig. Mr. COsO BvA?is then addressed the jury for Jones, and contended that it would not be safe for them to rely on the prosecutor's evidence to convict the prisoner. Mr. Baron tAnTis having summed up, The jUry were a long time considering their verdict, but could not agree. One of the jurymen said, they were ll to 1. A&r. Baron 1,uRTix said, their verdict must be unaulmons, and requested them to retire. After bebg loeked up for two hours the jury came Into court anld said they were stil 11U to 1, as we understood, for a coniviction. His LORDSHIP said the verdict must be unanimous, and it was the duty of the juryman, if he was not conxvinced, not to give way. Ultimately, there being no chance of the jury coming to an agreemenot, Elis LORDSHlIP discharged them from giving a verdict,'and lberated the prisoner on his entering into his recognizanees with two sureties to appear to take his trial again at the nest assizes. It was subsequently ascertained that the ll jurymen were for an acquittal mad only the one for a conviction. David Labisca, aged 25, groom, and Joseph Brookes, aged 21, puddler, were charged with the capital offence of robbin Thomas Toovey on the 16th of November, at Bilston, and stabbing him in the groin. Mr. Kettle appeared for the prosecution; the prisoners were undefended. It appeared that on the night in question the prosecutor was going home from his club when he was attacked on the road by two aen. He was knocked down and robbed of some tring articles he had about him, and while on the ground one of the men out him across the pubis with a nife. The knife descended to the none, but fortunately it did not reach any vital part. The prisoners were both previously known to the prosecutor, and clearly identified h an is evidence was confirmed by the fact that his pocket-handkerchief, which had been stolen, was found Thoe joury found both the prisoners Guty, and . oMART ordered sentence of death to be recorded; but intimated that it would ho commuted to penal servitude for 20 years. By sitting till a late hour his Lordship brought the business of these assizes to a close at about 7 o'clock.
NORTHERN CIRCUIT. YOR1K. DEC. 17. (Before Mr. Justice WILLiAmS.) Fanny Speed, 24, was placed at the bar, indicted for the wilful murder of her husband at Pontefract, on the 25th of July last. The prisoner is a young woman of prepossessing appearance, but was dressed in a gaudy and showy manner. hMr. Blanshard and Mr. Maule appeared for the prosecu. tion; Mr. Dearaley and Mr. J. W. Blackburn defended the pnsoner. Mr. BLANSHARD opened the case for the prosecution. From the speech of the learned counsel and from the examination in chief of the witnesses, it appeared that John Speed, the deceased, was a labourer residing at Barbicanrow in Pomfret, and working on Mr. Barker's farm. He was married to the prisoner about a year and eight months before his death. The prisoner had been engaged to a cousin of hers, Benjamin Wilks, who had gone to sea some time before her marriage, and had returned after that event. On Wednesday morning, the 22d of July, the deceased went to his work before breakfast and appeared to be In the enjoyment of his usual health. 'When he went to his work after breakfast he found himself so ill with vomiting aud pUrging that he was obliged to go home; he went to bed and continued ill for till Saturday night, when he died. The medical man clearly proved, both from the symptoms during life and from the post rmortem examination, that the deceased died from the effects of a large dose of arsenic. Mr. Morley, of Leeds, analyzed the contents of the stomach and the other organs, and discovered about 60 grains of that poison. The facts connecting the prisoner with the death of her husband were these: -She had on the evening of the 21st of July applied to Mr. Priestley, a druggist in Pontefract, for three pennyworth of arsenio and some olive oil, which he refused. She left her bottle at his shop and returned for it in half an hour. When she asked for the arsenic she said it was for a sore head. When she returned Mr. Priestleylasked her if she had got any arsenic. She said, "No; but I have got what wil do as well." She then showed him a small box, which contained an ointment which she said was white wax and oil, and which had all the appearances of such a composition. On the Saturday before this, it was also shown, she had asked a young man to get her some poison for a dog, which she said had flown at her. During the illness of the deceased he was attended by no one but the prisoner and the medical men. No one else had administered any medicine to him, and the medline given by the medical men contained no arsenic. After his death a large quantity of arsenic was found in a privy at the back of the house, which privy, however, was common to seven houses. The motive which induced the prisoner to commit the crime, as suggested by the learned counsel for the Crown, was that she might marry the sailor, Beniamin Wilks. It was shown that Wilks had heen on a visit at the Speeds', and that the prisoner had often spoken of her affection for him, and had on one occasion been seen to sit upon his knee with her arms round his neck. In addition to this, Fanny Speed, theprisoner, was heard on one occasion to say that she wished her hushand was dead and stiff, and she related what she said were her dreams, all of which she said had the tendency to show that her husband would not live long. On Tuesday, the 21st of July, she toldo no witness; that she had combed six white lice out of her head, whtch was a bad sign, and betokened an early death, and had heard the bell toll for him in her dreams. She also said three months before that a Gipsy woman had told her that her husband would be dead in six months, and she married again. To another witness she said he would be dead within a week. On cross-examination the vitnesses proved that the deceased and his wife had always livedon thenmost affectionate terms, almost like a newly-married couple. It was also shown that the deceased at the time of his death was labouring under a severe disease, which he had not communicated to the surgeons who attended him In his last ilness, and which was one of a nature which would cause him to avoid purchasing medicines of a regular practitioner. It was proved that there was a savage dog in the row in which the prisoner lived, and that it had flown at and bitten another person; that there was a Glpsy;woman In Pomfret who was accustomed to tell fortunes and interpret dreams, and one of the witnesses had seen her at Mrs. Speed's - that the deceased was as much attached to Benjamin WiIks as the prisoner was; that the prisoner and Wilks had been brought up together as children, and that she had said that she thought as much of him as of her own brother. Mr. DE&ABSLEY addressed the jury for the prisoner, and strongly urged upon them the absence of all reasonable motive for the act assigned to her. Hle denied that he was called upon to offer any suggestion as to how the deceased had taken arsenic. He did not deny that he had died of that poison, but he asserted that there was no proof that the prisoner had admiinistered it. With regard to her application for arsenic at Mr. Priestley's on the Tuesday night, it was proved that she did not obtain it there; yet, if she did obtain any arsenic it,must havo been obtained that nlght, else sbe would not have required to apply for it. The prosecution had had ample time to find out where she had obtained it. if she had obtained it, as it was clear from the evidence that it must have been got in Pontefract. Mr. Dearsley also suggested that, as the deceased was labouring under a disease which be carefully concealed from the regular medical man and from his wife, he was secretly taking medicine for his disorder from some quack or inexperienced person, and he m ight have taken one very large dose of arsenic by mistake on the Wednesday morning, which did not cause his death till Saturday; and from the evidence of the medical men it was possible and probable that he might have so lingered. The learned counsel dwelt forcibly on the conduct of the wife throughout the whole case, which was proved by many witnesses to be all that the conduct of a careful and affectionate wife should be. In conclusion, he urged the great improbability that a wife so happy as it appeared sbe was should have committed so foul and unnatural a crime as the murder of an affectionate husband. The Court then rose. WEDNESDAY, DEC. 17. This morning Mr. JUstice WILLTAMS proceeded to sum up the evidence. He warned the jury not to be led away from a manly discharge of their duty by the forcible eloquence of the learned counsel for the defence, who had painted the consequences of their verdict in such colours that It was calculated to scare them from returning a verdict of guilty, His Lordship then sutnmed up the evidence very carefully. He dwelt on the fact that when before the coroner the prisoner had denied having been in Mr. Priestley's shop on the Tuesday night, whereas if they believed Mr. Priestley and his assistant she must have been there and must have asked for arsenic. The difficulty In the case was, that no arsenic was traced to her possession, nor was any found in her house; and it was also difficult to say how she could have obtained it in Pomnfret on Tuesday night, after being refused at Mr. Priestley's. If, however, the deceased did not take the arsenic in the manner suggested by the counsel in the defence, from whose hands did hotake It? It was not even suggested by the learned counsel that any other person than the prisoner had an opportunity of administering the poison, and the statement of the prisoner also excluded thls supposition. If, however, the jury had any reasonable doubt as to the gailt of the prisoner, they would be bound to acquit her. The jury retired and in about 20 minutes retarned into court with a verdict of ZNot Guffiz.

POLICE. MANSION8iOUSE-uMr Fredeick lIby, a respectable. ookingperson, living at 2, Thornton-street, Horalydown, was brought before the LORD MA&YOR for having (as stated In the charge sheet) "attempted to steal from the person of Mfr.

The prosecutor said,-Durlng yesterday I sold out some stock for the prisoner, and purchased some Submarine Telegraph shares for hica. It was the fisst time I had had business transactions with him, although I had known him for some time previous. About 5 minutes to 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon I was about to ay into my banker's. I had rolled up a parcel containing fool. in notes, 10.. in gold, and five checks of the respective amounts of 5001. 17's. 4d., 5491. 2g. 6d., 81. 15a., (101. 7a. 6d., and 388. 6s. lOd. I had folded the inoney up in a paper called the paying-i paper, and had the roll in my band. The prisoner was standing in tho office with his back towards the counter. He spoke to me, but I do not recollect wbat he said. I turned round for the purpose of addressing him, and In an instant he flow at me, and by a sudden blow threw my right arm up in the air. While my arm was thus extonded he threw himself against me with his shoulder, and tore the money of which rhave spken out of my hands. I called to my son, who was writing at a desk. Ho came to my assist. ance, and I wrenchedthe money out of the prisoner's hands. I then went out and found a policeman, and took him baok and gave the prisoner into custody. The LORD MAYoR .-Tho prisoner did rot attempt to ron away, then? Prosecutor.-No, he stood there. He did mot offer to go away. I told him he might do so if he liked. The LoRD MAYOR.-DO I understand you to state that you told the prisoner he might go away if he lilked ? Prosecutor.-Yes, I did say so, I was so cnisfr.sed at the time, and so anxious to pay In to my banker's. Ihad drawn about 1,0001. In checks, and I wished to pay in these other checks to meet them. The LORD MAYoR.-Did he say anything to you when he took the money out of your hands? Prosecutor.-No. The LORD MAYOR.-Did he assign any reason for doing so ? Prosecutor.-No. He wanted me previously to sell the shares that I had just purchased. I had previously given him his check, his shares, and his contract. The LORD MAYOR.-Had there been no dispute between you at aul? Prosecutor.-No more than fthat he wanted to effect the sale of the shares immediately after he bought them. I told himthat as soon as Ihadpaidinlwouldreturn and attend to him. He bought some for money, and some for account. The LORD MtYOR.-Was any portion of tne money you had in your hand the proceeds of what you had sold for him? Prosecutor.-It was money that I recoived in consequence of the sale. Tha LORD MAYOR.-You made a sale for cahs ? Prosecutor.-Yes. Tho LoRD KAYOR.-Did you make a purchase for cash? Prosecutor.-A. portion.

I had sold for cash 3881. 6s, lOd., and I had bought for him for cash about 501- I gavo him a check for 341. and 60 Submarine Telegraph shares, being the 50& which I had paid him. I also delivered to him contracts in his name for 330 shares, which were to be paid for on the 30th of this month. The LORD MAYOR.-Then, it appears by th' cash transaction that you were indobted to him on the day's account 3041. 6s. 10d. Prosecautor.-Yes. The LORD MAYOR,-Dia he say that you were to keep that money til the account? Prosecutor.-No; he didnotsayanything of thekind. He wanted me to make a resale of the whole of the Submarine Telegraph shares which I had purchased, and which I had told m I would do as soon as I returned from my hankers. The LORD MAYOR.-Had he asked you to do so before you paid the money in? Prosecutor.-Yes. The LORD MAYOR.-More than once? Prosecutor.-Yes; he asked me once or twice to do so, but I was busy making up my money for the bankers. I was anxious to pay money in to meet checks that I had drawn. The LORD MAYOR.-Was It Consols you had sold out for him? Prosecutor.-Now Three per Cent. Consols. The LORD MAYOR.-What did you know of him provious to this ? Proseoutor.-I only know him as coming to make inquiries with respect to how ho should lay his money out. The LORD MAYOR.-It appears thatyoasold out a certain quantity of stock,and purchased a certain quantityof shares, leaving a balance due to him of 304l. 6s. lOd.-was it an understandmg that you were to keep that money in your possession till the account day ? Prosecutor.-There was no particular understanding. ithe eLORDl ?MAYO,-.No particular understanding ! But Prosecutor.-Yes; I constantly do It. Although I received cash I bought for thne account. Mr. Goodman.-But yom bought for the account in his name. Prosecutor.-In his name. Mr. Goodman.-And he was anxious that you should sell the shares at once, and give him a check at once ? Prosecutor.-Yes. The LORD MAYOR.-What did he say to you? Prosecator.-He said "Iwant these shares resold, and give metmy money." He authorized me to purchase for the accunt? The LORD MAYOR.-Was the money to be left in your hands from yesterday until the account day? Prosecutor.-There was no understanding about it. The LORD MAYOR-Tell me whether any one of these checks, or what portion of the money mentioned In the charge-sheet, was the produce of the stock which you had sold for him. Was it the check for 388. 6s. 10d. ? Proseentor.-The check for 3881. 6s. IOd. is that which I had received as the produce of his stock. TheLoRD MAYoR.-Why were you so anxious to pay this money inat a quarter before 3 o'clock? You had safflcient time to transact his business and pay the money in as well before the Bank was shut. Prosecutor.-3 o'clock is getting rather late. The LORD MAYOR.-You know that paying in a chook at five minutes before 4 is just as good as paying it in at a quarter before 3. Prosecutor.-I always make it a practice to pay in about the tine I have mentioned. The LORD xMAYOR (to the prisoner)-Do you wish to ask the prosecutor any questions? Prisoner.-No, my Lord. I wanted him to give pe either the shares or the cash. He gave sue this check (exhbiting the check for 341.) and told me to go and get it cashed, but I was determined not to leave him till he gave me upn my property. I did not like the transaction at all. Tne LORD MAYOR.-Did you say anything to him when he refased to give you the check ? Prisoner.-Yes, my Lord. I told him I thought it very strange, and that I did not like the transaction. The LORD MAYoR.-When you asked bim for the check for 3881., to which you were entitled for the sale of your stock, he gave you a check for 341. and told you to go and get the money for it. Prisoner.-Yes, my lord. Prosecutor.-I have not the slightest wish to injure the man, but I thought it too serious a matter to ppns over in silence. (Laughter.) The LORD MAYoR.-Prisoner, you showed some anxiety to got back your own property, but you were wrong in using force. You were right, I must confes8, in being cautious and in taking care of yourself. The charge preferred against you Is not substantiated, and you are discharged. You leave the dock without the slightest stain upon your character. There is not a breath of suspicion aantyou. Prosecutor.-I must prefer a charge of assault against him. The LORD MAYOr-Any charge you prefer against him I Wil listen to. Mr. Kilby then left the court with his friends.

Witn=8 examined theneck and found a wound apparently of some extents about an inch oft the carotid artery, fron whicbh there was exceasive hemorrhage. He directed the child to bu taken to the hospit*l, as she might bleed to death. Mr. BuncirAs asked whether he ascertained the extenft of the wound? Witne8s replied that he did not, eg It wag bleeding sk profusely. He, however, was of opinion that had the wound been inficted , little nearer the carotid artery it would have caused instantaneous death. From what the mother of the infant told him he considered he was justified in giving the prisoner into custody. Ann Sandwich, the wifo of Frederick Sandwich, said, the prisoner, his wife, and family lodged at her house, On the prevlous evening, between 6 and 7 o'l ock, he came down stairs to her and called out, " Oh I Mrs. Sandwich I have been playing with my child and I have cut its throat 1" Witness said, " For God's sake, how did you do that ?' He said, " I had my knife in my hand, and I thought I used the back of it in playing with her." Witness immediaStely had the child conveyed to the surgery of Mr. Francis. She wat positive that the prisoner loved his wife and children tom well to injur them. He always played with, the latter! when he was at home. Mr. BURCRAE asked whether he was sober at th.t time?2 Witness replied that he was and she was positive that i* was an accident. In answer to his worship she also said thbak he had been out of work for some time, but that would notr have caused him to attempt the lives of his children. In answer to the charge the prisoner said, that when he got home on the previous evening he took up the child to play with it. He had his knife in one hand open, and he thought he was using the back of the blade iastead of the front. As soon as he saw that he had cut the child he be. came much alarmed and ran down and told Mrs. Sandwich: what had occurred. He would not harm any of his childrern for the world. Mr. BURCEIAM1 said, that he was inclined to think, fronm what his landlady had stated, that he had not wilfuly cuti his child's throat, but stMl it was such a singuar clarge thatt it required some further investigation. He should like to have the evidence of Dr. Sharpe as to the extent of the wound and the probable way in which it waa inflicted - therefore he should remand the prisoner until Wednesday next, but he was willing to accept baiL The proposed srties having been accepted the prsoner, was dis-charged from custody.

MILITARY AND NAVAL INTELiIGBNBC. A General Order issued b_ hbis Rtoyal Highness the Camzmander. in.Chief, reprehending tho lenity of memnlers of General Courts-martial on thoerial of offioers convicted of grave offences, was yesterday morning read -in thegarrison -anesnroom at Woolwich, -"d desired to be generaUy made known, as folows :- o Horse-Guards, Deo. S. t Upon twvo occasions officers who bave been convicted .,upon thocleareste donee-of most severe ofienoes against mili. tary discipline have -been recommended by General Courtsmartialto Her ajestys merciful consideration. In one case the individual was fornd guilty of having sloented himself from his corps vithout leave for a considerable time*setting at defiance all military subordination. In the other case the prisoner was convicted of habitual contempt of the orders of his commanding-officer, and was moreover, found guity of scandalous conduct unbecoming the cha. racterof an officer and a gentleman. In other instancesthere were no mitigating circumstances, but in both the courts. martial having adjudged the prisoners the punishment duo -o their crimes, accompanying the Eentence by a recommendation to mercy, the General Commanding-ln-Chief, in the exerciseo f his judgment, did not feel justi6ed in sup. porting such recommendation, bx9ed upon the youth and inexperience of the offender. There have been-aud there may hefter be-occasSions where youth and inexperience may be urged in mitigation of punishment, but persevering and systematic disobedience of orders and deliberate falsehood can admit of no palliation; and his Royal Highness the Dake of Cambridge most earnestly desires that, where officers are caUed upon to adjudicate upon matters involving such serious offences, they wiU pause and seriously reflesc before they recommend to Her Majesty's clenmency iedividuals who have been found guilty, and who thereby have been proved unworthy of serving their Queen and country In a profession which must be upheld by the principles of honour and discipline." The detachment of the 13th Light Infantry, needed to complete the Argo's allotment of troops for India, having arrived at Portsmouth yesterday afternoon from Wales, and the medicine chest having also found Its way on board from Devon, the shlp will leave Portsmouth harbour for Spit. head this forenoon, and sail thence to-morro-v morning for India, weather permitting.

Cap. tain the Hon. G. F. Hastings, C.B., of the Blenheim, pro. secuted. The Court, after hearing the evidence in support of the charge, called upon the prisoner for his defence, whioh *as a most able composition. He also handed in a great number of certificates of character and opinion from the commanding ofricers under whom he had served, all which were testimonials of the highest order in his favour, and remarkably so as regards his habitual sobriety and gentlemanly demeanour. The Court found the charge proved, but in consideration of the prisoner's previous high character "only adjudged him to be severely reprimanded and dismissed from Her Majesty's ship Blenheim." Lieutenant W. S. C. Pin will, 27th Enniskillens, has been appointed to the command of the troops garrisoning Upnor Castle, Chatham.

THB INDIAN MUTINIES. The following is an e-tract of a letter from an ! officer of the 64th R>egiment, on the Generars Staff at Lucknow, to a brother officer at Cawnpore:- " Lucknow, Ocf. 27. "My dear M-,-I dare say you thought I neer answered your last to me, but I did. It unfortunately, however, was obliged to be destroyed, as the bearer was stopped on his way to Alumbagh. However, there was not much la it, so you lost nothing. We got your good news of the reinforcements this morning. I am certain the greater portion of the niggers will bolt when they hear of the Delhi column having crossed the Ganges. They are dividing their affections at present between Alumbagh and us, so we only have half the work with them, but they kick up no end of a row every morning with their bands and drums and bugles. They must be rather tired of it by this time, and, I think, will scarcely stay to get another pounding from the new colamn if it be as strong as report makes it. They are falling out among themselves now, and cannot have much more ammunition left. All we want is a body of troops to occupy the suburbs opposite the two bridges; we could then easily force a passage to this side of the bridges, and thus open a comunnication with the country for cattle and grub again. - vwvill astonish their optics a little, I fancy. They attacked the M'Intyre's people at the Alumbagh the other day, but did not do much harm; in fact, none at all. We are very bard up for the luxuries of life here. No soap, no beer, wine, nor spirits of any kind; nothing to drink bat water; no tobacco. S-, T-, and T. C- are smoking leaves of trees. Hard times ! I suppose all my letters have been sent up to Alumbagh to S-, where I suppose they'll remain till the reinforcements arrive. Tell S-, with my salaam, I will give him a few lines shortly, but cannot trust these small chits; they too often miscarry. Tell B- to look after my kit at Cawnporo. Poor Seer Khau (servant) I am afrad was cut up on the 25th. He has never been seen sinee. I do not know what I shall do without him. I've no servants now except the orderly sheiks, and they won't do much. I get on extremely well with the General, and am very comfortable. He mentioned me in his despatch for the charge to the intrenchments on the 25th. Colone1 Tytler has had a very severe bout of it. He was almosc gone, but has now taken a turn for the better. His wound was a bad one to heal. Colonel Campbell, too, of the 90th, has been very ill, but is now better. Poor Groom, lst AL. E, is dead; also Arnold, of the same; Halihburton, 78th, died of wounds; Simmons, 5th, killed in a sortie; Johnson, 5th, died of wounds. I suppose most of the officers of our corps are now with you.

EXTRA ORDINARY MET'OB. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-A meteor of extraordinary briliancy was seen in this neighbourhood on Wednesday evening, about 10 minutes before 8. It was of a blood-red colour, and traversed the heavens from north to west. The labourers who saw it were quite terrified at its appearance. At 4 a.m. this morning the sky presented an extraordinary appearance, the heavens being illuminated in the north-west with a bright fiery red, as if lighted up by a conflagration. You will probably hear further particulars from other quarters. x. y. z, Wokingham, Berks, Dec. 17.
THE LEVIATBZAN. TO THE EDITOR OF TE[B TIMES. Sir,-Very obvious expedients are often overlooked. Why should not the "ways" for the launching of the Leviathan be at once altered from their gradient of one in 12 to a gradient of one in 8 or lesso? Yours obediently. N. R. Dec. 17.
CROSSED CHECKS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Is there any reason why a check on a banker should not be drawn thus?- " Messrs. AB.-Pay through some banker to C.D., or bearer, the sum of 0I." The direction to pay through some banker would thus be part of the check, I suppose. The Act of 19 and 20 Victoria, cap. 25, seemes to imply that a check with sach a direction forming part of it would bo valid. Yonrs obedientlv. NQ. R, Dec. 17.
DEAT}I or ADMIRAL. SIr, F. BEAuFoRT.-We have to announce the deathof Rear-Admiral Sir Franos Beaufort, F.R.S., F.G.S., F.R.A.S,, &o., which took place at Brighton on Wednesday. Rear-Admiral Beaufort was son of the late Rev. Daniel Augis. tus Beaufort, D.D., rector of Navan, county Meath, and vicar of CoUon, county Louth. He entered the navy June 21, 1787, as a volunteer on board the Colossus, 74, Captain Hugh Cloberry Christian, stationed in the Channel; he became midshipman, In June, 1790, of the Latona, 38, Captatn Albemarle Bertie. He next served for three years in the Aquilon, 32, Captain the Hon. Robert Stopford, one of Lord Howe'srepeaters In the action of June 1, 1794; and while attached to the Phaeton, 38, commanded in succession by the latter officer and Captain James Nicoll Morris, was present in Cornwallis's celebrated retreat, June 17, 1795; assisted in the course of the samne year in driving on shore on the Isle de R6 and destroying L'Echou6, of 2S guns ; took part in the capture, March 10, 1796, of La Bonne Citoyenne, of 20 guns; fought in a partial action, hMarch 23, 1798, with the French 36-gun frigate La Charente; was Instrumental, Sept?mber 8 following, to the capture of La Flore, S6; and witnessed the taking on various occasions of nine privateers and otber armed vessels. On October 28, 1800, whUe first lieutenant of the Phaeton, he performed an exploit of great spirit and gallantry in boarding, with the barge and two cutters under his orders, and capturing, after an obsti. nate resistance, the Spanish polacre-rigged ship San Josef, carrying 14 brass guns, 34 seamen, and 22 soldiers, moored under the protection of five guns on the fortress of Fuengirola, near Malaga, and flanked by a French privateer. For his determined bravery in this affair, in which the enemy had 19 men wounded, and the British 1 man killed and 4 wounded, he, who, forming one of the latter, had received a wound in the heed and several slugs through his left arm and body, was, on the 13th of the foUowing month, deservedly rewarded with a commander's commission, and for his severe sufferings was awarded a pension of 451. 12s. Gd. From November, 1803, until June, 1804, we find him gratuitously devoting his time to the formation of a line of telegraphs from Dublin to Galway. On June the 5th, 1805, he obtained command of the Woolwieh, 44. armre en flde!, in which ship he first proceeded to the East Indies, then to the Rio de la Plata, of wbich he made a very accurate survey during the campaign of 1807-and afterwards to the Cape of Good Hope and the Mediterranean. His next appoint. ments were :-May 23, 1809, to the Blossomsloop, employed on the coast of Spain, at Quebec, and in annoying various fleets of morchantmen; and May 30, 1810, on promotion to post rank, to the Frederickstein frigate. Captain Beaufort did not, however, join the latter ship until December 12 following, being in the interval employed in protectingthe outwardbound trado to Portugal, Cadiz, and Gibraltar, In accompanying two Spanish line-of-battle ships from the latter place to Minorca, and in discharging the duties from September 27 to October 21 of acting captaia of the ViUe de Paris, 110. During the two following years he was actively engaged in a survey of the coast of iaramania, in Asia Minor, an employment he was obliged to relinquish in consequence of a nearly fatal gunshot wound be received from the hands of a fanatical Turk, June 20, 1812. Captain Beaufort, who had previously contributed to the extirpation of a band of pirateafrom the southern part of the Morea, then returned ome with convoy, and on the 29th of October in the same year was paid off. For several years after his arrival In England Rear-Admiral Beaufort appears to have been fuly occupied in laying down the results of his labours, and in constructing, under the orders of the Lords of the Admiralty, a variety of charts, of which we may enumerate one of the Archipelago, three of the Black Sea, &c., ineluding the Coast of Africa, and seven of Raramanja. He became hydrographerto the Admiralty in July, 1832; was nominated April, 1835, a commissioner for inquiry into the laws, &c., under which pilots were appointed, governed, and paid; and again, in January, lSi, for inquiring into the state of the harbours, shores, and rivers of the united kingdom. He accepted the rank of retired rear-admiral on the ist of October, 1846. IiNDLLS RELInF FuNQ-The Edinburgh committee have received a communication from Mr. Parry Woodcock, honorary secretary to the £und In London, stating, in reference to applications for relief for the wvives and families of soldiers who have gone to India, that the metropolitan committee consider it to be out of their power to give the solicited relief. Any distress or suffering caused to these parties cannot be conmidered as directly ascribable to the ndian mutiny, but to the condition of military life which make It impossible for soldiers to cgrry their wives and children with them on going abroad on active service. The letter points to local relief, administereil through local committees, as the only proper mode of remedying such cases of distress. The Edinburgh committee had previously corns to the same resolrtion, and the present Cetter of course strengthens their determination not to apply any portion of th fund committed to them in tbat manner. The subscrip. tions through the Edinbergh. committee now amount to nearly 20,00'.

THZ AsERIOAN MAiL ROBBFR.-The Newhlahere Register gives full particulars of the detection and a-rest of William S. luckorman:-"A mostimportant arresttook place in this oity on Sunday evening, for extensive maill robberies committed within a few weeks past. These robberies embraced The entire letter mail on several occaslons made up at Philadelphia, New Orleans, and other oints, for Boston, at least one mail from Boston for New ork, and several others of less importance. The officers of the Post.office Department, it seems, have been secretly on the alert to ascertain where and by whom these alarming depredations were committed, the management of the case having been placed in the hands of Mr. Holbrook, one of the most experienced special agents. It soon appeared that the missing mails were chiefly those which would go by the railroad ronte between New York and Boston on the Sunday night trains. After a good deal of watching and careful investigation, it was believed that Springfield was one of the points selected by the robber for his bold operations, but it was not until Sunday night, the 22d ult., that any discoveries were made at that locality. The trains from New York and Boston meet there, and it was observed that the mailcarfromNewYork was sometimesleftforafew moments without lights or fastenings. On the night in queslion, Mr. Holbrook and Mlr. Clark, of the New York Post-office, were on the train, in disguise, on its arrival at Springfield, andjust as the lights were withdrawn from the baggTe or mail car, took up their position therein near the s, and ready for an emergency, naturally supposing that the robber, his deeds being evil, preferred darkness rather than light. A moment's suspense, and footsteps were heard near the car and upon the platform. In an instant the door opened, and the expected visitor entered and instantly struck a match, ostensibly with which to light a cigar, already 'In position,' but really, no doubt, to see if al was right. During the momentary light from the aforesaid match, It is difficult to determine which had the advantage, Uncle Sam's men or the lucifer match adventurer; but, believing that the latter would have the best of it unless something was done speedily, Holbrook (intending to pass himself and companion off as bon4 fide passengers just stepped into the baggage car for a 'smoke,') coolly says to his assistaut, 'Tom, where's that good cigar you offered me ' To which Tom! immediately responded by handing out the cigar. Before even this was accomplished, the match had done its worst on both sides, the watchers and the watched. ' Give me a light, if you please,' says Holbrook to the supposed mail robber, whereupon the favour was instantly granted, and both were smoking away, thus far equally in the dark ! Presently the train began to move, and the stranger moved too, jumping off while it was in motion. To carry out the idea of being ordinary passengers, the rest of the company, joined by Mlr. Chap£n, postmaster of Springfield, had to continue on the train, behleving that the object of the robber had been thwarted for that night, at least, if Indeed he had not been permanently alarmed. Not so, however, for the New York letter-pouoh from Boston was abstracted that night while the vigilant officers were going east toward3 Boston. Fully satisfied from this discovery that the eneploy4s of the railroad companies were in no way implicated, more rapid progress could now be safely made in ascertaining who this stranger could be, when on comaparing notes the description auswered well to that of a person who had fre. quently passed over that route, endeavouring, with too much success, to secure the confidence and favour of the conductor and baggagemen, particularly those on the Sunday night trains. No suspicion has arisen, however, as of course the loss of the maUs was unknown to them, and yet it now appears his frequent passage and unusual familiarity had been made the subject of some conversation. Fnrther exertions resulted in ascertaining the name auId locality of this agreeable traveller, and a close watch was set upon all his movements, and every preparation made for his detection if he repeated the robberies. Just before the train left Now Yorlc on last Sunday evening he arrived at the depot, in Twenty.seventh-street, but the special agent had arrived before him and taken a position in the baggage or mail car, where he could both near and se withouttbeing seen or heard. On this occasion, as had often happened before, the baggage of the suspected party conssted of a large trunk, which he declined to have mafrKed for any partlcular point, saying that if he met a gentleman at Springfield, where the trains meet, he should return to New York that night. ' All right,' says the baggage-master, and the aforesaid trunk was placed by itself, where it could readily be controlled by the final decision of its owner. Before reaching Stamford he again appeared in the baggage car, where he was purposely left alone for a few moments while 'wooding.up,' and the opportunity was improved by transferring the New Orleans mail poucu from its proper place to the trunk of uncertain destination. Becoming subsequently alarmed at an unguarded yet trivial movement of the conductor, and being left alone for a mnomenit while the hands were I'breaking up,' he as dexterously removed the deposits from the trunk back to their former position. The rest of the story can be told in a few words. At the depot in this city, Mr. Holbrook came out from his close quarters, and at once arrested William S. Tuckerman as the author of all the-se bold mail robberies. Upon his person and in his valise were found the most overwhelming evidences that no mistalse had been mAde inx the man, and he was soon after committed to gaol. The trunk referred to and its fixtures bear the strongest proofs of having been prepared for the ilegal purposes to which it was puxt on this occasion, having a peculiar lock to admit of its being opened withlot the slightest inconvenience or noise of a key, and the valise which was found inside containing heavy iron weights oest the lightness of the trunk at one point andaheavinessa another after receiving the mails should attract attentiox and lead to suspicioni.HIls uniform and gentlemanly deportnent and very respectable appearance had prevented anYsuspicion among the hands as to the object of his unusual civuitltes and familiarity, and his fondneqs for smoking and liberal distribution of the best quaLity of cigars bad furnished the pretext and pavedl the way for oftea riding in the baggage-car, It is hoped that the lesson taught in this instance, of the risk and imipropriety of allowing oxtesidors in the cars provided for isisils and bageagog, will not be lost upon the managers and eesploy6s ofNe w Englasnd and other railroads. The Prisoner was formally brought before the LUnited ~SfAtes' Commissioner c. iP. In.- gersoll'ycaterday, andl his boil fixed at $20,000.

THB BNGL ISH IONE5 AT SAL.ERNO. Mr. Watt, of Newcastle, the father of one of the British engineers confined in the dungeons of Naples, has received the following letter from the chaplain to the Briti5h Embassy,at that place:- " Naples, Deo. 9. "Sir,-I received your letter on Mondav, the 7th, and knowing how anxious your son was to hear of all his dear relatives at home, I took the very first opportunity (i. e., yesterday) of going down to Salerno to show it to him; though it was a Je8skt, or holyday, and I was in danger of going for nothing, as all officials are generally absent from home on those days. I found that the Procurator-General was from home, bat after sending for himn in various directions I gained admittance to the prison. The delay, however, was the cause of my being longer with the prisoners; as it made me too late for the afternoon train, and so I stayed for the evening one, and spent considerable time in Aonversation with them. Your son seemed better in health than he was before-though he made no complaints to me then-but he now looks stronger, with inore coloar, and more cheerfrd. This I suppose, arises from their having been removed into a larger room, where they can take exercise, and have the company of all their fellow-prisoners. Indeed, they all seemed quite cheerful, and conversed freelv with the officer who accompanied me, as well as with myself. Your son and his companion, Parks, assured me that they acted by my counsel, and constantly prayed to God to sup. port and reheve them, and read their Bible every day; they also returned 15 religious tracts I had lent them, and desired to have some more. So I really trust that their afflection may, with God's grace, be turned to good account, and that they will for the future be more sincere and earnest disciples of Christ than they have hitherto been, and be able to say with the Holy Psalmist, 'Blessed is the man, 0 Lord, whom thon chastenest ; before I was afflicted I I went wrong, but now I have krept thy statutes.' I paid them a second vWit the week after I wrote last (Thursday, 26th ult), and found they had been moved two days to the larger apartment. You perhaps have seen in the newspapers a, report that one of the prisoners had attempted suicde. I heard this after I returned from my lirst visit to them; and there: ore, on my second visit, I thought it |nght to question them about it. Your son confessed that he had done so, and, as far as I could learn, he was induced to make the attempt by a melancholy feeHng of despon- dency, which led him to imagine that all was against him. His companion told me It arose from misunderstanding wbat was said about, him by his companions through his aot understanding the Italian language thoroughly. On the 26th of Ntovember 1 talked very earnestly and seriously to him upon the subject, and he assured me he would never attempt any, thing of the kind again, and I have good reason to hope he sees it in its true light, and will keep his promise. I talked to him again about it yesterday, and he said cheerfully that there was no danger of such a thing again. He is evidently of a silent and nervous disposition. I suppose they did not like to confess this sad thing, and so said nothing about It on my first visit. Being permitted by the King of i Naples to visit them as a minister of religion, when nobody l else was allowed to see them, I did not cross-question them about anything, as it would have been dishonourable to act in any way as a spy. I merely desired them to tell me anything they wished voluntarily; and their statements I gave you the general summary of in my last letter. Besides, my object was chiefly religious, to lead them to take their affliction patiently, and bear up courageously, in dependence upon God's help and protection; whereas, if I had spent my visits in ouestioning them about grievances, they would have fancied themselves, perhaps, worso treated than they have been, and been irritated and more east down in spirit, instead of being calmed or cheered. I therefore, I repeat, only heard and have written to you what they told me of their own accord. Yesterday your son said he was very much comforted by your letter and those of his friends, which I let him read for himself. He begged me earnestly to write directly, and send you all his love, and tell you he was well and cheerful. I obtained leave for him to write and send a letter by me, and I promised to wait in the town two hours for him to send it to me if he chose to write. I did not get any letter from him, and indeed he gave me to understand that he could not write. Perhaps he did not I like writing with so many in the room, as he is rather shy and nervous. As I have very much to occupy my time and thoughts as a minister, and so cannot go thorougbly into the question, I have made little inquiry about the legal part of your son's case, or about the justice ot the arrest, politically and internationally. It was not my business, and I shouid do no good by interfering in It; but for your sake, I asked the Procurator-General yesterday bow their trial was goin, on, and he told me it was proceeding as quickly as possible. The forms of justice are slow in this country, but I think the utmost will be done for them, as the British Government have exerted themselves very much on the subject, and Her Majesty's Acting-Consul at Naples -went down to Salerno last week and the week before. I cannot think now of anything more to tell you, but I will always write when I have any particular information for you, and let your son have your letters. "I have written in very great haste, and have not time to look over my letter, as I wish to save the post to-day, otherwise I cannot send my letter before Saturday; bat I hope I have written so as to be understood by you. "Yours faithfully, G. PUGH, Chaplain."
SZATR OF TRADB. There is a comBRADF'ORD, DEc. 17. There is a cormplete cessation of business in our market to-day. This bemg the principal market-day there is a fair attendance of merchants, spinners, and manufactuxers on Change, but their attention is entirely occupied with the heavy suspensions wvhich have occurred in the worsted trade withinthe lastfew daya. All parties, of courrse, are hoping for the beat, but they profer waiting to see wrhere these disasters are likely to terminate before entering into any now transa,ctions. As to the affaira of Messrs. S. C. Lister and Co., it now appears that out of all the concerns ir, which Mr. S. C. Lister, of Manningham-park, Bradford, is a partner, and the operations of which are carried on in mills at Bradford, Halifax, leieghley, and Addingham, in the West Riding, and also at Parls and Berlin, the only one which has sus~ended payment is that at Halifax. The creditors of the al nch of the iirm have recelved a circtlar, of which the following is a copy: *Wellington-mUls, Haifax, Dec. 15. "Gentlemen,-It Is with much reRret that we havato announce thst unforeseen cLrumstsnsea and other causes have compelled us tor the present to sspend our payment. 3e3sra.

Mr. Liter is also enab to state that the other ooncerns in which he is a psrtner ase in a perdectly sound talte. We are, Gentlemen, your very obedient serva,lts, " S. C. LItl it AYiD Co." The Leeds MerclT says:-" We are assured that the liabilities of the Halifax firm are not very considerable, and it is stil hoped thAt the concern may be helped through its difficulties., It is stated that the bills of the Halifax firm of Messrs. S. C. Lister and Co., to the amount of nearly 1(o,o0Oo., were held by Messrs. William Cheesebrough and Son, extensive wooistaplera, of Bradford, and this has caused the latter firm to suspend payments. A circular has been issued by Messrs. William Cheesebrough and Son to their creditors stating that their books will be put into the hands of an accountant for examination. The belief is entertained that all the creditors of this firm will be paid in fAul, and that the suspension will only be temporary. Messrs. William I Cheesebrough and Son's stoppage has been precipitated by that of Mr. Edward Smith, of Uxbridge, who is said to have been speculating extensively in wooL Two or threo other suspensions in the Bradford trade have to be added to the preceding. Messrs. Goldstein and Kappele, a German house, carrying on business as commission merchants at Bradford, have been obliged to stop payment. They were not in a very large way of business. Mr. Jam es Dalby, stuffmanufacturer, Bradford, has also been brought down through the severe mercantile pressure. A meeting of his creditors has been held, at which a statement was submitted showing his liabilities to be about 4,0001., with a deficiency of 8001. No offer was made to the creditors, who are thus left to act as they may think best. Mr. Dalby has been contracting his engagements for some time, and has succeeded in reducing his original liabilities to a considerable extent. Mr. James Taylor, worsted spinner and stuff manufacturer, of Ovenden, has also stopped, his premises having been talon possesion of under a bhi of sale held by Messrs. S. C. Lister and Co., and Mr. William Cheesebrough. With regard to the suspension of payments by Messrs. Saalfield Brothers, connected with the 'trade of the West Riding, and who have been extensively engaged in business in London and on the continent for many years. it is stated that the liabilities of the firm are comparatively small to manufacturers in this district, and a hope is entertained that the house may speedily resume business. A few facts as to the general condition of this borough may not be out of place. At a meeting beld the other day for the purpose of raising a subscription for the relief of the workpeople who have been thrown out of employment by reason of the great depression in trade, ono of the speakers attempted to give an estimate of the extent of the distress in Bradford. MEr. John Priesenuan, a gentleman extensively engaged itn more than one branch of commerce, addressed the meeting and said,- *- He apprehended that tie intensity of the distreis had naver been exceeded during the Ians 30 years, taking into conaideration the rbortness of the period which had elaDsed since its commencement. It affected al branches of trade In the borough-the morebant, spinner and manufacturer. It was not limited to them. It extended to the smal tradespeople. The ironfounders, he nderztoot, were affected bFj It. Certainly the dyers were, and the building trades generally. As regardel the sDpiners and manufacturers, hbe hould e6stiate that the working hours were reduced at least se per enut., when he teok lnto connideratlon the machinery thst was 8taudinz anD tte mnills which were wrising shor tthee. The derreciation I1 reference to sto:k he hould look upon asat least 20per cent.. Therefore, hothought he wa justfledein sayig tbat the distress aff,rd ealeclu tore. The weore Ing people. of courie, suffered the most, Itnamuch a3s If his stiteneot waa correct. they had inst 50 per cent. of their labour." Stil, taldg tho whole of the Bradford Poor Law Utnion, jwhich comprises the townships of Bradford, Horton, ManDingham, and Bowling, the aggregate population of which in 1856 was supposed to be about 114.000, there are tcarcely so mnany paupers on the books at the pro- esat time as there were at the corresponding ,eriod of 1854. The return made to the guardians In the first week of the present month showed that Ihere were 3,993 paupers receiving relief from the funds unf the nion. At the end of the follo wing week this numter had increased to 4,294, against 3,122 relieved in the *orresponding week of last year. In tbo'first week of Decem'cor, 1854, when there wVas much distress in the borough, 9l,4r3 paupers were on the books of the union. The appliations, how ever, are greatly increasing in number just now, snd theamount of pauperism will proba.blyvwithin a very short time exceed that of 1854.

CRZYSTAL PALACE COfPANY. A special general meeting of this company was held yesterday at the Bridge-house Hotel, to receive a report from tho directors, to raise money or debenture stock, and to elect four now directora. MIr. Grove, the secretary, read the notice convening the meeting. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in the The Times, wa taken as read. The COH.em, said there were three matters to which I he would call their attention-the recommendations in the directors report, the scheme for the reduction of capital, and the election of fonr new directors. With respect to the recommendations in the report the principal one related to the necessity for taking up the debenture stock of the company. Unless they co-uld do that, the other matters would be of but little importance. The interests of the company required that the stock skould be taken, or at least so much of it as would meet the liabilities of the company. Owing to the debenture stock not being taken up freely, the direotors were under the necessity of raislag money on temporary loans for short periods, which had to be renewed, and thus formed *n unworkable debt. The directors asked them to substitnte the debentare stock for a like amount of temporary loans and thus relieve the company from its difficulties. He then advertel to a letter sent to the shareholders by Mr. Fuller, which, among other things, stated that the directors had brought tho company to a standstill until the shareholders could raise 220,0001. more. This was an unwarrantable statement, and calculated to produce an injurions effect, because they were not going to raise any additional capital. The object of the new capital was to take the place of existing debts and to meet debenttres falling due. Every debt oring by the company had been settled; they had not a single unsettled account. (Hear.) The capital account since the end of 1855 had beon closed. Theyhadincurred no freshdebtsincethattime, everythinghadbeenpaid outofrevenne. He thenmentionedthatthe income-tax people had objected to some of the charges against revenue, the tax upon which they had to pay. Tho fact was, they had no capital to go to, and they were obliged to take evervthing out of revenue. In round numbers the ordinary cajpital amounted to 1,000.000L, the borrowed money and debenture stock to 250,0001., and the preference shares to 150,0001., making together 1,400,0001. It would be recoUlcted that the committee of investigation had made an estimate of all the debts and liabilities of the company, and it was satisfactoryfor the proprietors to know that those debts were now settled for an amount within that estimate, and he could see no reason for adding anything to it. They had a freehold of 200 acres of landfree from debt, a very fine building containing numerous works of art, and the revenuo yielding from l0,OOOb to 12,0001. -year, at least during the presentyear. Thedirectors wished to be relieved from the very onerous duty of borrowing from time to time various sums of money for the company in the shape of temporary loans, by the shareholders subscribing for a sufficient amount of debenture stock to pay them off. Those temporary loans inured the reputation of the company, and cost more than a ixed debt. They had hitherto fulfilled all their engage. ments--at aU evenbs, so far as the public were concerned. The 64,0001. owing for land would be due next year, and would be paid for out of the sum they proposed to raise on the debenture stook. His view was that it was easier for a large number of smaU shareholders to subscribe the money than a small number of large shareholders. If persons holding five shares were to take 51. of the new stock, and those holding 20 shares 201. of it, the thing would be done. There were 4,000 shareholders and if they would aU take up their proportion of the new stock there would be no difficulty. He had received some valuable suggestions on the subject from some of the share. holders. Tbey propose to extend the instalments for the now stock over twelve months. There would be four payments of 25 per cent. each. Mr. 'W msoc thought that shareholders should have the right of paying in full at once, as many would prefer thit course. The CHAIRatLx would be happy to afford every facUity to those who wished to pay up in full, as it would tend very much to relieve the company. In reply to a question he stated that the preference shares could not claim arrears if there should not be sufficient in any one year to pay them, Ele was glad to say that some of the shareholders in the count ry would take up more than their proportion of the new stock, which would probably make up the deticiency for those who may not be able to subscribe. lis friend Mr. Anderson wvas illing to subscribe more money, and so was he (theChairman), provided others would subscribe. Amnoug those who had promised subscriptions wa the Duke of Devonshire, who had expressed his wil. liungness to suabscribe 2,5001. There were others, so that on the whole he fully expected that a considerable sum would be subscribed. It was matter of vital importance to them to obtain a sufficent sum, and it should be borne in mind they were not going to add anything to their existing capital a- coLunt or liab ities. Abont 120,0001. in addition to the 31,0001. already subsoribed would be sufficient. There was about 115,0001. of debt in the hands of the public. He concluded by moving a formal resolution to the effect that it was of the utmost-importance to the interests of the company that the remainder of the debenture stock be forthwith subscribed, the meeting pledging itself to forward this object by every means in its power, and stating that the subscriptions to this 61. per cent. debenture stock should not be held binding unless 120.0001. of it were ulbtA Mr. BILLING only held one preference share, and 'would have great pleasure in subscribing for 501. of the stock(Hear.) EIe suggested that vwhen 250,0001. was subsecbed the subscription Tist should be closed. Mr. FrULLE explained' thnt he had no wish to make any misstatement; hennderstood the capital wonld bel,500,0001., instead of 1,400,0001., as nowv stated;* they 'were, therefore, 100,0001. richer than be thought they owere. The resolution 'was put, and carried unanimously. The CH}utL,Ax then proposed a resolution In accordance with a recommendation in the report, and in accordance with the Act of Parliament, to the effect that the directors be authorized to enter into agreements with shareholders to exchange their shares for tickets of admission. He believed the scheme proposed in the report 'was entirely differentfromany scheme that had been proposed. It had resulted from a conversation he had had with Sir J. Paxton a short time ago. He believed that It would meet every objection, and was the only practicable mode of reducing the capital without materially interfering with the revenue of the company. The arrangement would enable the shareholders to visit the palace and grounds on Sundays In the afternoon; and from the view he took of the proposition legally, and otherwise, he felt confident in recommending it for their adopton. (Cheers.) Ee believed there would be no infringement of the law, and that it could he carried out very much to the advantage of the Mr. O0. LIE seconded the motion. Captain YouNG moved an amendment to the effect .hat the admittance to the Palace and the grounds on any part of the Lord's Day would be a violation of the law and of the Fourth Commandment. He proceeded amid considerable uproar and interruption to support his amendment, and contended that the voice of the public was as 30 to 1 against the motion. The CHAIRiSAo had no wish to induce persons to visit the grounds against their wish; he was only anxious that those who desired to visit them should have the opportunity. So far as he (the Chairman) was concerned, he frequently visited the grounds on a Sunday afternoon (hear), and found that it was very agreeable. Those who did not like to go would of counrse stay away. (Cheers.) They proposed to do nothing more than had been done by the proprietors of the Zoological and tbe Botanical Gardens. The permission to visit the Palace and grounds would not be against the spirit of the charter. Air. LowNN-, a director, contended that Captain Young had been imused by the meeting; they ought to have heard him. He (Mr. Lowe) stood alone at tho Board on that question. He considered that the echeme would have the effect of injuring their revenue. They might gain by the issue of 10,000 of those tickets 5001. or 1,6001. a-year in the shape of interest or dividend, but they would lose 30,0001. for admittances at the doors, or at the rate of 10,0001. a-year for the three years they would remain in force, He was decidedly opposed to the scheme. The CHAIRMAN explained that it was merely an experiment; he differed entirely from Mr. Lowe on the commercial question, and believed it would not affect the receipts, except in a very slight degree; and the scheme would enable them to reduce their capital without feeling it in their revenue. If it should not answer they could easily retrace their steps, and no harm would be done. The amendment was then put and negatived by a large Ir. Bt CKLFY proposed an amendment to the effect that the admission to the Palace on Sundays be left out of the original motion. Tfhis amendment was also negatived by a large majority. Mr. FULLER proposed as an amendment that the ticket for each share converted should be for 100 admisslons, instead of G0. This was also negatived. Mr. AUSTIN had great Dleasure ir supporting the original motion, particularly as he believed the directors were taking the right steps to induce the million to visit the Palace, The original motion was then carried. The C11A1Rs%Ls N said that the Crystal Palace line would be opened from Battersea to Beokenham In April next, and there was every probability of the line being extended from the station at Battersea across the Thames to the Grosvenor canal within 500 or 600 yards of the Queen's palace. The election of the new directors was then proceeded with. On a show of bands there appeared 103 for Captain E. Walter, 96 for Mr. Horseley, 02 for Mr. Bicknell, 60 for Mr. Spiller, 57 for Mr. Reed, 55 for Mr. England, and 10 for Mr. Laurie. A poll 'was demanded, and it was agreed that the list of candidates should be sen's to each shareholder requesting their approval of four out of the seven. The four who might happen to have the largest number of assents were to be elected directors of the company. The scrutineers were then appointed, and The proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.

A SOLDIERS GRIEVANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-One is almost afraid to speak of "' a soldier's grievance," lest by any means " the complaint' should recoil on the injured party. But a wrong to some members of the 2d battalion of the Rifles has late]y been made known to me of such a character that I am anxious, if possible, to secure your advocacy In their behalf. When this regiment sailed from Dublin for India Colonel Woodford, then in command, recommended the rDen to leave their Crimean medals at home with their friends for security. Two-thirds of the men did so; but mark the result. On the voyage, Colonel Hill, now commanding the corps, ordered a dress parade, and has fined every man who could not show his medal U2s5 Gd. ! Moreover, he ordered them to write home for their medals, and threatens with court-martial all who in due course do not produce them. The young man from whom I hear these facts enlisted during the Crimean war from love of the service and duty, being at the time in a good business, and, in fact, he might be called a middle-class man. He is a thorough soldier, and his medal is now in the safe custody of his sister, a member of my household. It is prized by his whole family, and was left at home, not by neglect or from indifference, but at the express advice of his commandIng officer - and now, forsooth, he is to be punished as if he had commLtted a kind of theft. Now, Sir, I submit that such treatment is most unfair, and little czlculatd to encourage our respectable young men to enlist. A tyrannical commander has too many ways of spiting a private for him to venture on complaints; but if yon would really take up such a case, perhaps the authorities might yet set this matter to rights. Colonel Woodford may have given injudicious advice; nevertheless Colonel Hill ought not to punish men for following their commanding officer's suggestions. I aam.&c.. A LOVER OF FAIR PLAY. Dec. 15.
