IRELAND. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPOND0 I DUBLIN, Tuxssi 1EVxD =2XTENSION OF THE PRocLAfiED DISTRIcr. The following annoucement appears in the Post of this evening:- " At a meeting of the Privy Counoil, held on Saturdaypresent, the Lord-Lieutenant, the Lord Chanoellor, the Lord Justice, Mr. Baron Greene, the Attorney-General, the Recorder, and the Right Hon. J. W. Fitzpatrick-it was resolved to enlarge the limits of the procaimed district, so as to embrace several additional townlands on the Down side of Belfast, and an additional proclamation was agreed to accordingly. We understand that thi fresh step was rendered necessary by reports from the local authorities that the arms which had been so lately in the hands of the rioters had been carried across the river and concesled in the adjoining districts of Down, within reach andavailable for immediate use in case an opportunity was presented for fresh disturbances. " The Proclamation now embraces the whole of Belfast and its suburbs, with a considerable rural district on each side, within which any person who carries or has arms, without license, is subject to heavy penal consequences. We hail this step as a fresh indication of the intention of the j Executive to use the powers of the law for the repression of | outrage and the oomplete restoration of peace and order. | The result of the firm measures of the Government is already apparent; the last two Sundays have passed over with the peaceful characteristics which ought to mark the Christian Sabbath and unsignalized by tumult or disorder. 'We most sincerely hope that the people of Belfast have been awakened to a sense of the misconduct and humiliation so widely prevailing, and that, by the continuance of peace and obedionce to the law, they may soon be in a posi | tlon to be again placed within the pale of the constitution I and on a footing with the rest of the community." Referring to Lord Carlisle's observations on the state of Belfast, delivered by his Excellency on Saturday at the meeting of the Senate of the Queen's IJniversity, the Post rmakes the following I observations:- "It has just occurred to us to place the subject of the Belfast riots and street-preaching in a light in which It has not yet been viewed. Belfast is the only comniderable town in Ireland disgraced by party riots and wreckings. It is the only large town in which the population is at all equally divided as regards religious denominations; and it is the only town where there is an organized party confederacy, backed by preaching in the public highways, to assail and outrage the portion of the inhabitants belonging to one particular denomination. Even in Ulster, Belfast is the only town in this most discreditable condition. Suppose the Orange population were stronger, more numerous, and better armed than the Roman Catholics, surely that fact would restrain men of true courage,not to speak of religion, from taking advantage of their strength to play the bully and the tyrant. Look to the south, the east, and the west-to Munster, Leinster, and Connaught. LI every town, great and small, the Cathoics very largely preponderate. In many places they outnumber the established church and other denominations by ten to one. Yet, without soldiery, and often without police, Protestants are as safe from insult or attack as if the towns were garrisoned for their protection. In all those towns where Catholics form the preponderating majority there are no societies or dubs to insult or preach against Protestants. On the contrary, it Is our sincere belief that if any personshad thewickedness toattempt aggressionsagainst the Protestant inhabitants, they would be crushed by the whole force of public indignation. Why, then, Is it that Belfast-the only large town in vrhioh the population is about equally divided-should be ignobly listinguished for ntolerant persecution against Catholics? Clearly because t is the hotbed of Orangeism, and because clergymen be. longing to the Presbyterian as wellas the established church have so far forgotten their sacred calling and responsibilities as to herd among the heated patisans of the Grange Lodges and to become the agents of faction, insteadof the ministers of Deace."

ERIRATA.-In the account of the loss of the Transit, which appeared in The Times of the 6th inst., the name of the Major of the 90th was erroneously giver as Burnston," instead of " Barnston." LoNDON AIND MDDLESEX ARCH.EOLOGICAL SOCIETY -The members and friends of this society met on Monday to the number of several hundreds at Hanipton Court Palace, for the purpose of inspecting the various objects of interest which abound in that favourite locality. They assembled at half -past 12 o'clock in the great hall, where the were addressed by the Rev. Thomas lHugo, who afterwards conducted them over the building, and pointed out to their notice the objects which needed or deserved remark. The palace stood on what was in the first instance a domain belonging to the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jeru. 41em. Cardinal Wolsey succeeded in obtaining a grant of i', and in the year 1615 commenced the erection of an edifice, which he designed on a scale of almost | n Aralleled magnificence. After his fal, nowever, Henry V_J, witha view, nodoubt, to remove from the palace some portion of its founder's prctie demolished the eat hail and chapel and replaced them with erections of his own. The popular belief which attributes to the Cardinal the erection the he present hai is therefore incorrect. The present hail was the work of Henry, and was in all probability in no way superior, but rather the contrary, to that of the Cardinal, whose taste and architectural skil were notorous. In the withdrawing-room, as in the hall itself, attention was specially caled to the tapestry, which is among the finest in England. The fireplace is frequently considered of the time of Elizabeth, but was pronounced by the reverend ciLcrone to be principaly, if not entirely, of that of William and Mary. The portrait of Wolsey, which is usually said to be the only authentic likeness of him in existence, Mr. Hugo did not scruple to stigmatize as a copy, which he did not believe to be 150 years old. The next part of the building which was noticed was the chapeL The waaUs and roof of this edifice are of the time of Henry VIII., but the interior has been entirely remodelled by Sir Christopher Wren, who lined the apartment with Palladian carpenter's work, enthuiasticaUy lauded by Mr. Hugo, and profusely ornamented it with splendid carvings by Grinlin Gibbons. I The ill effect of the polychromed ceiling was owing, accord ing to some supplemental observations of Mr. Godwin, to the absence of stained glass from the windows. After leaving the chapel, Mr. Hugo conducted the company through the ancient offices, the chapel-court, kiitchen-court, racket-lane fc., and thence overthe newer portion of the palace erected by Sir Christopher Wren, of whom he appeared to be a most zealous admirer. Indeed, he avowed a preference for that architect's work over many portions of the older palace - for in the last year of Henry VIIL Gothic architecture hali become a mere sham, and sham Gothic 300 years ago, like sham Gothic now, was a detestable and miserable thing. At the same time, it was only fair to say that in all probability the finest portions of the earlier work were no longer in existence. The picture galeries, the erivate gardens, the vine, and the superb, but little known, Iron railings of the 9ime of William and Mary, between the bowling-green and the park, were duly visited and commented on. After a vote of cordial thanks to the rev. leader a*d the other members of council who had attended the meeting and made the anticiptiory arrngements, the company separated, highly delighted with the intellectual treat which had eeDn afforded to them,f'
THE BRIf ALL MURDXR. The following additional evidence was given at the ad. journed inquest on Ttesday evening- Benjamin Cooper.-I am a sergeant of the Cheehire county constabulary. I acoompanied Superintendent Andrews to the house of the deeamed about 4 *clock on the morning of Wednesday last. I found the prisoner and his brother Thomas there, and I afterwards saw the dead body of the deceased. After we had rade an examination of the house Mr. Andrews left, and I remained in charge. Before he left he locked up the aitting-room and took the key with him. No one went Into it during his absence. With the exception of Sergeant Hammond and myself no one went into the deceaseds bedroom until Mtr. Andrews returned. I produoe a leathern shotbag and a powderfisk, which I found in a drawer in a washlazdi table in the prisoner'g bedroom. The bag is half full of shot, and there Is some powder in the flask I also produce two exploded cape,which I found in the same drawer, in which was sIso a box containing a number of caps which corresponded with the spent ones. I have sinoe taken 12 shots from the shotbag and delivered them to Mr. John Graham who weighed them in my presence, and they corresponded in weight with 12 others which he had. I searched the premises, outside andin, on the morning of the murder, as soon as it was dayligt, but could find no traces of any footmarks. George Young Creham.-I am a surgeon, practhing at Stockport. On the 30th of September last I made an examination of the deceased's body at the request of Mr. Andrew-. I found the deceased lying on his back in bed, his head resting on the pillow, and his face a little inclined to the right. Neitner the pillow nor the bolster pear ohve been disturbed in the least after T.e eceasd had laid down to rest. His arms were outside the beddothes in a perfectly natural position. Both hands were closed and crossed over each other. Both legs were stretched out and close together; and the soles of both feet re"ted firmly against the footboard. Upon the ordinary covering of the bed was laid a shepherd's plaid, which reached from the deceased's chest to the Dottom of the bel; it was tucked in,and rested firmly between the deceased's feet and the footboard of the bed. The plaid was perfectly smooth, and did not appear to have been disturbed in the slightest degree. It required, indeed, a little effortto release it from the footboard. The face was extensively blackened from exploded powder, the blackness extending from the chin to the forehead The upper part of the deceaeed's shirt on the left side was alsoa ittle blak ened. The right eyelds were perfectly closed, but the left lower eyelid was sightly open. There was large quantity of blood upon the bed, on the right gide of the deceased There was a gunshot wound on the face, and the blood had escaped from It on to the bedclothes, from which it had flowed in several streams to the mattras, and thence to the floor. I should think there were at least 12z. of coagulated blood on the floor, in addition to the large quantity found upon the bedelothes, On exa ining the wound I found that a considerable rtion of the upper lip, a small strip of the cartilage of tKc nose, and the whole of both the hard and the soft palate, with the teeth :rQm the upper jaw, had been carried away by the shot. The edges of the wound were Iscerated and blackened. The right malar or cheek bone and the bones of the nose on the right side were not injured. The bones of the face, as well as those of tht3 nose, on the left side were completely shattered, so that tbe left cheek sank for proper support. I also found an opening in the anterior portion of the base of the skull. Portions of the bones were driven into the brain, and the hole vas sufficiently large to allowr me to Pass my finger through the opening. I next had the body removed from the bed, and stripped. On the left arm I found a small bruise, but not of recent date. I and my son then examined the brain. On removing the top of the skull we did not discover any marks of injury to the npper portion of the brain, but at the base and back part there was a quantity of coagulated blood. We next removed the brain from the skull, and fouud that it was lacerated at the base at a part exactly corresponding with the internal fracture of the bones, Blood was extensively extravasated in the substance of the brain, and Iextracted the eightshotswhichInowpro. duce fromthe brain. I next examined the mouth, atthe back part of which I found the two shots and two teeth which now produce. The tongue was slightly lacerated. The whole of the viscera were hI thy. From the Lbove facts, my impresdon is that the deceased was shot while asleep, ad that death was instantaneous and without a struggle, I consider death to have been caused by injury to the brain and shock to the nervous system, which was produced by the gunshot wound. At the request of the coroner, I and my son, and Mr. Downes, a surgeon of Stockport, made a further post nortem examination on Friday last,. We removed the top of the skull, and Mr. Downs made a most careful examination of it. We then tried to discover any more shot that might be in the body. For this purpose we removed the tongue, trachea, and cesophaus and we found on the right side, among the deep-seated muscles of the neck, and also scattered about the mouth, a quantity of shot which weighed about two drachms two scruples, making the total weight of shot extracted from the dy at both times three drachms. By Mr. Roberts.-I was not acquainted personally with the deceased. I never saw a more healthy man. It is usual for some persons to lie on the baek. The bedelothes indicatedperfect rest. The left hand was closed, but not gra,sped tightly, as it would have been if there had been any resistance. By the Coroner.-I have no hesitation in saying that the person who fired at the deceased must have stood somewhat to the right of him. Judging from the direction which the shot took, I do not think it is Possible that the deceased could have been in a rising or sitting posture when ho was shot. George Downs.-I am a surgeon of StockPort. On Friday laat I made a post movtem examination of the body of the deceased, in company with the last wfitness and his son, Mr. John Grahamn. I concur in the evidence given by Mr, Graham as to the state of the wounds, and also generally as to the Caulse oE death. John George Grabam.-I am a smrgeon at Stockport. I assisted my father at both examinations of the deceased's body, and concur with him entirel in the evidence which he as given. I produce the shots takea from the deceased's neck at the second examination. I have kept 12 of them in a separate )OX. I also produce two parcels of shot consisting of 12 each, which I received from Mr. Andrews, on Saturday, and another parcel of 12, which I received from Sergeant Cooper this morning. I have weighed them al by the standard and with each other, and they are exactly of the same weight. Charles Lomax.-I am a letterprees printer at Stockport. I have examined the portion of the publication, The Cottage Gir-l; or, The Mca-a-c Day, found in the prisoner's bedroom, and, on comparing it with the perfect number now shown to me, I have no doubt that both arn printed from the same type, and the illustrations in front of both are from the same block. Among the pieess of the packet now shown to me marked " C" (composing the wad found in deceased's body), I find the numerals " 1,198," and portions of three printed leaves, which correspond with the corresponding lines in the perfect number. The paper marked ' D," now shown to me (part of the wad found on the stairs), contains portions of 10 lines which correspond with corresponding lines in page 1198 in the perfect number. in both copies, in the fragment and in the perfect number, the word " robes" is spelt with a "o" (robcs) instead of "e." Another portion forms the last six lines of the same page. I have no doubt whatever that the type from which the whole of the pieces were printed is the same as that from which the perfect number is printed. John Walker.-I am a steam-packet agent at Maichester, I knew the deceased and the whole of the members of the family, except the eldest daughter, whom I have never seen. I have known the prisoner for 12 or 13 years, and the deceased for four or five years, which was a short time before he left Scotland. I have had conversations with the prisoner respecting his father. The first conversation was in March last. Mr. Roberts objected to conversations which took place so lon ago; but The Coroner decided upon receiving them. Examination cnntinued.-I had a conversation with the prisoner on some day in March last, when he caUed at my office, 77, Market-street, He complained greatly of his father's conduct, and used abusive expressions towards his father, such as " Do you know that d- old rascal and old villain? He is quite by himself. He is quite deranged. He is abusing us all, and we must get him into a madhouse as he is not t to conduct his business or to have anything to do with the management of the farm, and I intend to take it out of his hands." He then producoed a paer, and said it was a copy of the lease of his father's farm between him and Colonel Davenport (the landlord) forl9 years. He said he would leave Itinmy possession, and Iwas to keep it secret from the family. I then said that I would not take it unless it was made up in a paroel, sealed, and addressed to himself, with the direction " to lie untl called for." The prisoner then sealed it up in a prcl, with a seal bearing the initials " J. H." He wrote upon it the present ad dress, 1 Mr. James Henderson, jun., Bramall-hall, by Stockport, care of Mr. John Walker, Stoampacket-offico, 77, Market-street, Manchester."-{The parcel was here opened, and it was found to contain a plain copy of the lease, bearing the following endorsement]:- Xst Deowmher. I Dlme Ma DarenPort to M:r. James lHenderon Csyleae f frmin Bramejil, In the county of Cheater, tor 19 yars.Slee l f lIttu ears 22 n atr-Ardsfor thesel dueof he er £20, ayble 21th jnne2' [A mistake appears to have been made in tbe endorsement as the lease itself commencesonthe 25th of December, 1853.] When he talked about getting his father into a madhouse I remonstrated with him and said he must not try to do so, as his father was perfectly sane and the surgeons could soon ascertain it. During the same interview the prisoner at different times called his father !' a blind old --. Since that time I have never seen the prisoner and his father together. I have seen both separately, and they eah com- phined of the other. A few days after the lease was left wth me the prisoner called on me and said, " We can't put up with that old fellow ; I have given him soueth that he'll mind. I have had to tie his hands and feet." Thinking that the old man had been hurt, I came over to Brarmall the next morning to see him. I then saw marks of violence on the deceased's body, His two eyes were very severely swollen and blackened. (Sensation.) Hlis upper lip was aso sv,ollen, as was likewise his left jaw, which seemed to have been caused by a kick, The skiu ws all off his left arm which he bared to show me. The shin bones of both legs were black with bruises. Those were all the marks that I saw. On Wednesday morning last after the murder the prisoner called upon me in Manehester. He first called between 9 and half-past 9 o'clock, but I had not then arrved, and he came again shortly before 11 o'clock. I adthen heard of the murder. When he came into tho office he walked round the counter to the window where I was standing. He was thon accompanied by another youn man, named 3atthieson and I asked them to be seated. I sald to the prisoner that I was sorry for the transaction which iad taken placo; and h replied that it was a sad thing, or circumstauce. I inquired if his father wLs shot and if so, where I and, putting his bi'nd to hie washt cheok, he said " through there." He was next asked whether his father was killed with a pisto, or gun, and he answered " by a gun." I then said, addrLming the prisoner, " eNow, Sir, rest assured that the murderer will be found out - if MM ot God vwilw " I mentioned the Inanovs of iirs j Manning and Rush, and said, " Horrid murderers canmot escape," upon which he and the other youzg man go0 up and left. Previous to this, when the p;Aoner first came into the office, I asked him how the unfortunate occurrence took place, and he thenisaid, "About 2 oeclock thia morning I heard a noise in the home, and I took out. my gun, because on Monday mny father had a sale of cattle, and the auctioneer and other partieE id there vwee many rough characters about; and owing to the money that was taken for the cattle they miight l1y siege to the house at night. I then loaded my gun, both barrels, but ag no one appeared that night, on Tuesday morning, observing a few small birds on a tree in the garden, I let fly at them, and brought down one. I then put the gutn by in the corner of mybedroom; and on the Wednesday morning, about 2 o'clock I heard a noise in the house, and got out of bed, and took my gun and went to my bedroom door. By a darkish light. from the window on the landing I observed a man there, six feet high; and I iramediatelyput my gun to my shoulder, fired at him, and it struck him here (pointing to the lower part of his right cheek). When he got the ahot he gnTe a great jump and a loud screech. I then observed two men go downstairs, with their feet muffled, and I called to my brother Thomas and told him there were robbers in the house." He forther said that he knew the robbers hd been in the cellar, because they had left the tap of the ala cask running. In speaking of his going into his father's room, and finding him kIlled, he said, "I hall not forget that sight the longest day I live." The deoesaed called at my oflicem an tnmessince March; andIhad always lookedupon hum as a clever masn, and cerfectly capable of nagng any farm, if he had his eyesight as he formerly hAd John Cooke.-I am the land-agent of Lieutenant.Colonel Davenport, of Bramall-hall. The deoeased was one of the Colonel's tenants, under the terms mentioned in the lease preduced. I sawe him frequently during his tenancy, and knea the prisoner vey we I have had a conversation with the prisoner respecting this farm. About U or 12 months agO I received a letter from him, which I now produce. It is in his handwriting, and, is as follows:- EHardy'is yarm, 13amalL, Batuodiy Evening. e "rC}coke,-My dear Sir,- sall isel sxtre>nElyobied byyou calingupn m onModayevein abut oclor,at wine agn uDo Crli'aie conversation writh yen, cODUpbd wIth a fewr small attr, re- tiv totbO(8m lExting circumstnces prevent me cling upon yout a.

I went and had an interview with the prisoner on the Mon- day evening. He commenced by saying that what he wasgo g to slate was a hard tbing for a son to say against a father, and that he wished to bave a little private conversation with me durng his father's absence m Scotlad. He then said his fatber's temper and disposition were so bad that they coUld not live wvith him, and that through his (the fat er's) stupidity he had had a lawsut while he was in Scotland, which had almost ruined him. He also stated that his father ivas a very great drunkard while he lived in Sootland and he added, "I do not know Whether you are aware that I found the greater portion of the money to come upon tbe far>, and I wish very much to have the power for my brother and self to manage and conduct the farm. I wishyou to speak to Colonel Davenport to know whether it cannot be arranged that I and my brother should have the farm insteed of my father, and I will see that the rent is punctu. ally paid. If so, my father shall have a comfortable home and walk about as he pleases, but I should wish him not to interfere, for I do not consider him fit for business, his eyesight being very bad, and he has on more than one occasion paid a sovereign instead of a shilling. The prisoner then referred to the covenant in the lease respecting the additional rent to be paid after the first four year, and said, " My father will not pay the additional rent because he does not consider that the farm will afford it, but I am sure it will if it is properly managed ; and if I can have the management of it I will see that it is paid." In. answer to what he had said I replied, " It is all very well, MIr. James, but you know that your father is tenant, and that unless he is agreeable nothing can be done," I asked him if his brother and mother and siste':d were agreeable, supposing his father and Colonel Davenport were ; and he said, "T hey are perfectly agreeable, and they wish it to be so." Since then he has repeated the application at my own house; I think it was iu March last. From my intercourse with the deceased I considered him a man of vigorous intellect, and capable of managing his own affairs. He was a lttle stupid (obstinate) sometimes, but I never thought he was incapable of managing his affirs H called at my house on the Saturday before his death. This being the last witness to be called for the prosecution ,Mr. Roberts obtained the permission of the coroner to call a witness to prove the finding of the brace. Charles Henry Smith, son of one of the prisoner's employers,-I came over to Bramall this morning with my tather, and I went with him to the deceased's house. We were looking about in the garden, and in the grass near a tree, opposite to the end of the house in which there is only one window, I found the back part of the brace now produced. My father picked up another piece of a brace (the front part of one) about four inches from the same spot. There was a mark on one part of the brace which looked like blood. Not far off I sav an old pair of trowsers, without braces, which were in the same state of dilapidation. There were also several pieces of old cloth lying about, I afterwards pointed out the place where I found the brace to gr. Andrews. Thomas Smith.-I am a cornfactor at Manchester. My son handed to me one piece of brace, and I picked up the otber piece. By Mr. Roberts.-The prisoner has been in the employ of myself and my partner for three years and a-half or four y Everything was satisfactory during that time, and cns'idered him to be a good and honest man. I never saw him idle a moment while he waa with me. By the Coroner.-The prisoner was rather parsimonious. Mr. Superintendent Andrews was recalled, and he stated that he had been shown the spot in the garden where the two pieces of brace were found. HA had several tiames before, on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday last, examined that spot, and it was impossible that the pieces could have been there without having been seen. The grass had been carefully searched to find the wadding used by the prisoner when he shot the sparrow, and a piece of good gun.vwadding was found there. A pairof old trowsers and some pieces of rag were also there now which were not there when the previous search vas made. This completed the evidenco, and at ten minutes to S o'clock the Coroner began to sum up. HIe strongly deprecated the comments which had been made by the press, and urged the jury to dismiss from their minds all except the sworn testimony which had been given before them during the inquiry. The fact of the murder was undoubted; but as to the way in which it was committed there were two suggestions. In the first place it was suggested by the son James that three or four burglars entered the house, broke open the writingdesk, and then proceeded to the old mau's room. The statistics of crime in this country showed that the object of all burglars was plunder and not mnurder, and that they never desired to commit bloodshed unless for the purpose of personal protection or of securing booty. In this caseit was suggested thst the burglars had broken open the riting-case, but, considering its lightness, it was more probable that they would have taken away the case altogether. Under any circumstanees, they would not have taken the trouble to break open the lock when it was actually unlocked. The murder of the old man when asleep ws most inconsistent with the supposition that it Was the act of burglars. It was most extraordinary that the table in wvhich there was so much money, as well as the deceased's clothes, in which there was a shilling, had not been touched. It did not seem likely that burglars would have deliberately committed an act which would at once have alarmed the whole house, and still less likely was it that a man would have stood on the stairs after the report of the gun. The other suggestion-the very meution of which almost made one shudder-was that the old man had been murdered by his son James. This involved a charge of such a serious nature that he (the coroner) deemed it his duty to read over the whole ot the evidence relating to it. This he did at great length, commenting upon it as he proceeded. Shortly after half-past 9 o'clock the jury retired to consider their verdict, and they returned after an absence of about half an hour. Their names having been called over, the Foreman (Mr. Charles Marsland) said, " We find James Henderson guilty of the murder of his father." The Coroner inquired if they were unanimous in their verdict, and the foreman replied that they were, The Coroner then issued his warrant for the committal of the prisoner, and tho vritnesses were bound over to prosecute at the next Cheshire assizes. The prisoner will be brouht before the magistrates at Stockport to-morrow (Thursay). Although occasionally during the inquiry yesterday he exhibited some nervous twitchings about his mouth, he did not display any other symptoms of emotion, not even when the most damaging parts of the evidence were being given against him. He listened attentively to the statements of the whole of the witnesses, but appeared little if at all exited.
TIiE MITTh7 IN- IXNDL.-The followmin prayer has boon suggested and recommended by the Bishop of Bdinburh, Prinmus, to be used during tho mutiny in British India before the General Thanksgiving :-" 0 Lord God Almighty, who rulest the nations upon earth by Thine unsearchable providence, making the vw-rath of nian to praise Thee, and tuming the apparent success of the wick-ed to the furtherance of Thine eternal purposes of truth, justice, and mercy, we thine afflicted servants flee unto Thee for aid and comfort in this our time of great sorrow and anxiety. We acknowledge, 0 Lord, that neither individually nor as a nation have we duly felt our obligations to Thee for all Thy mercies, nor the responsibility under which we lay to use the wealth and power which Thou hast pormitted our nation to attain, for Thy honour and for the good of our fellowcreatures. We aoknowledge that in these matters we havo incurred the gUilt of many sins of omission, and it may be of commission also; but Thy word oncourageth those who confess their sins to flee unto Thee, t at their iniquity may be forgiven. Hear, then, O Lord, the prayer of thine afflicted people, and as of old Thou didst stay the hand of the avenging angel at the prayer of Thy servant David, so now stay the murderous violence of the heathen, who are purposed to exterminate all those who throughout India call upon the name of Thy Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. Supnort, by Thy providential aid, and by the comfort of Thy Holy Spirit, our fellow-subjeots in the East who are in sorrow or peril, the wounded, the homeless, and the destituto, those who mourn for the slain, and those who are in doubt and fear as to the fate of their nearest and dearest relatives. Grant to our counsellors wisdom; grant to our soldiers strength and vietory in the day of battle; grant to all those that are now bowing before Thee the spirit of prayer, repentance, and faith, so that we may come purified out of the fire of affliction, and be enabled to trust in Thy mercy even while smarting under the chastisement we have incurred. Hear, O Lord, in heaven Thy dvellin,-.plaoe, and answer and forgive, for Christ's sake. Amen.

T HE D AY OF HIUMILIATIOIN. ST. PAUL'S CATRFT)RAT. r1t the conclusion of the special service appointed for the i&y of solemn fast, humiliation, and prayer before Al-nighty God, the sermon was preached at this cathedral in the morning by the Rev. B. M. Cowie, one of the minor *canons, to a very full congregation. The Lord Mayor was present during the morning service, but was unattended by any official retinue, his attendance in state being deterred 'ill the afternoon. The Rev. B. AL Cowie took for his text part of the 47th -verse of the 17th chapter of Samuel, Book L "The Battle Is the Lord's;" and, alluding to the special object for which the day had been set apart, observed that It was difficult to conceive a more sublime idea than that of a nation humbling itself before God, acknowledging the justice of His rebuke, and praying for the restoration of the Divine favour. Christians and men, who ought to be dead to the world, who were subjects of a kingdom more extensive than any earthly realm, whose citizenship wrs in Heaven, were called upon that day to weep and lament, to pray and invoke Divine aid. If It were denmanded how could such a service be called for from them the answer was to be found in the words of the text: -"The attle 1s the Lord's." Our empire, the most extensive the world knew, stretched over a tract comprising200 millions of inhabitants in Asia, and there a fearful mutiny had spread far and wide, and an inknown number of our fellow Christian subjects had fallen victims to the crtiel ,hatred of the insurgents, under circumstances too dreadful to be detailed. The reverend gentleman then went on to observe that in this state of thinigs the Church of Christ in Great Britain and Ireland humbled itself before its Divine Head, with the view of reminding Him that the battle is Eis, and of declaring that, though they had neglected t1 fight bravely and strenuously for Him hitherto (for that was their sin), yet now they were resolved no longer to allow this reproach to rest on them. They would attack evil and in Divine strength subdue it, their war cry being "The battle is the Lord's." Having pointed out that in such -calamities as the presenit they must recognize the chastening hand of God, the minister expressed his decided conviction that formost among their sins was neglect in spreading Christianity among the idolatrous and lnfidel populations of India. The nuwber of those emtployed in conveying to the knowledge of the swarming tribes of that vast peninsular the glorious gospel of Christ, the nmessage of mercy, love, and peace, -was painfully disproportionate to the task, and, coinpared to the work to be done, much fewer in proportion than tha.t gallant band whose nsove,,ents were followed with aching hearts and feverish anxiety, and who, under God, might yet have rescued from slaugh ter the endiining garrison of the chief Cty of Oude. Since the days when the honoured nane of Christian Frederick Schwartz was a tower of strength to the Christian cause in India, the progress made had been infinitesiusial, not from the want of zeal of those who had followed in his wake, but from their fewness. After referriDg to the atrocities recently perpetrated in India, the rev. gentleman declared thlt the only remedy given from Heaven against the nataral depravity of man was the religion of Jesus Christ. Hearts must be subdued before such beilgs as those who had now risen against the English could become trustworthy aud faithful, and the way to bring this result about was to exhibit Cbristianity in a way wnrthy of its Divine Author, and not to pander to heathen follies or sympathize with the followers of a false prophlet. They ought to recollect the Saviour's words, " Go ye into all the world and premcis the Gospel to every creature." They had neglected this cominn.d of Christ, and IIow they experienced the truth of the prophet's words: " Therefore have I also made you, saith the Lord of Hosts, base and contemptible before all the people." Passing on to the subject for wbich they were specially called together that day, tho hev. hr. Cowie reminded them that they were to go forth to the war as tho subjects ansl servant-i of the Holy One; they were to avenge the outraged honour of God, to re-establish by armis a respect for those natural laws of purity, justice, and honour, which were emanations from the mind of God. The atrocities of heathen barbarians were to be punished-not imitated. No ! rather let themn see iu the triumrph of British valour a stern, severe, uncompromising, but jsi-t retribution,-an assertion of the maiesty amid dignity of God's law. Let there he no private, 'indictive retaliation, but deliberate execution of the sentence of death on all niurderers and traitors, coupled with a muaguaninsous recognitioss of services rendered, kindness shown, and fidelity exhibited under circumstances of peril. Let it never he in the power of the infidel anid the pagan to retort upon them that tho mercy they preached was Ignored in their conduct. They must therefore pray that the God of mercy would so direct the British soldiers that they ..ight not stain their noble crusade against vice and cruelty hy any participation in evil. Let not the innocent suffer with the guilty, let not any blind fury mar the sevoro lesson whicrl the triumph of our arnms migbt teach the nations. Tihe rev. preachier then observed, that in praying for success to British valour the sincerity of their prayers was to be tested by their actions; and be said to the strong in heart and limb that now was the time to show that they were in earnest. Would they stand by listless, inert, and shrinking vhile innocence was being outraged, children torn lirmb froimi limb, while moneters in the shape of men were perpetrating crimes which sisade the stronigestshudder, their hearts miielt, and their limbs qniver! The voice of the country, of their own blood, the voice of the Sovereign of these realms, the voice of religion, the voice of Christianity, the voice of God-all called loudly upon themn to ri.se as one man to the rescuo, and to steni the lieod of wickedness, zruelty, rebellion, and treason. To those who could not go outto the battle there wasanotherduty. What must be the heart-tortur. of a mother who had lost a daughter in that chamber of blood at Cawnpore? If they had any Christian feeling tFey Nwould not allow that poor mother to be witisout substantial marks of their syiiim'athy. Neither could they neglecttheniany littlochildren leftfatherless and motherless. 'The rev. gentleman, inconcluding his discourse, eitreated the congregart.ni m loet the fast day be a reality. If they were sincerely ansious that God shonld hear their prayers let not their emotions dwindle away into inaction. Let them pro. mote by all means in their power the efforts mnade to put down crime, to re-establish the auathority of their h'hristian Sovereign, and let them take care that there wam no slackness of assistance In the great work of Christianizing those whom God should restore to the British rule. Let theimi aLso exhibit that day a unanimous and vigorous resolve to make an offering becoming the cathedral church of that great city. In the afternoon the Lord Mayor attended the cathedral in state, being accompanied by memsbers of the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council, the sherifts, and officers of the corporation in their official robes. The sermon was preached by Canon Dale, vicar of St. Pancras. The rev. gentleman selected as his text the following words in the 7th verse of the 2Gth chapter of Isaiah :-" When thy judgments are on the earth the in. habitants of the world will learn righteousness ;' and then proceeded as follows:- And yet, my brethren, there aro some among the inhabit. ants of the world who deny God in His judgmeints, while they do not deny God in himself ; who look only to second causes, and take no account of that never-falling Provi. dence wh.ch ordereth a31 things both in heaven and on earth. And to act thus is reputed wisdom, while, in truth, it is consumnmate folly ; for what can heo more contrary to reason than to derogate from the attrihntes of the Deity while yet mea deny n't Ills existence ? What more contrary to reason thaa to liimiit the exercise of power which yet is confessed to be almighty, and to circumscribe the raiige of wisdom which is at the same time acknowledged to he infinite? To exclude the Lord of all worlds from dominijon over tho works ot Ills own hands, to agsues vwit':ont any show of reason or a shadow of authority whatever that He wxhohad created would not control, o that -when his creatures bad formned themselves into societies or c'Illnunities they woiild be less regarded by Hiim than wheti isolated as individuals,-this in the conception ix surely the extresie of folly, and this in the apDlication is unquestiosnably the extreme of p-esumption. To deny the operationi of (od or His judgmient.s, whether the famine or the pestilenue, the warfare or the mutiny, Is practically to deDy God hiniself; and they who act thus presuwptuously are foreto!-l by the prophet Isaiah what the end will be, "Lord, when tby Lord is lifted up they will not see; but they shall se and be ashamed." They have belied the L,rd in saying it is not He. " Shall there be evil in the city," asks another prophet, "and the Lord hath not done it?" Does not the Lord himself declare, " I make peace and create evil ? I the Lord de all these things." Oh, then, let us beware of ascriblngto secondary and subordinate causes that which is the work of God. Let us acknowledge with -the Psahliist, " He is the Lord our God, His jiu-ginents are on all the earth." And when, ats now, His judgments nre abroad en the earth,whsn fear bath come upon our countrymen as a desolation,and destruction as a whirlwind, and die. tress and anglihh have come upon those whose positi^n seemed by tlie Lord's favour to stand strong; let us supplicate on behalf of all that the inhlabitants of the world mnay learn righteotMtegs s lot Us say for ourselvea as well a3 for others, Coien, and let us returs unto the Lord, for He hath torn and He wiU heal us, He bath smIltten and He will bind us up. Sonio put their trust in chariots and tonie in horses, but we wilU remember the name of the Lord our God. Now, Judgments are the eonsequences of sins; but it does not follow from this that particular judgments are the consequences of particular sins. or even that in the case of a nation, at least, the retribution Is al?ways exacted of the same persons by whom tho penalty has been iuanrred. Manasseh hfled Jeragalem with innocent blood, which the Lord would not pardon; but Manasseh hiniself becamae a penitent, and died in peace; and even wben conipunc. tious visitings were awlakened in the heart of the reckless and Uthless Ahab, " 9eest thou," said the Lord to His servant Elisha, "how Ahab huiiibleth himself before me ? Because he humbleth himself before mue I will not hring the evil in his days, but in bia eons' days will I bring the evtl rupon his house." Just such is our own'present experlence. Wemaysay eencerning that mos feaful and widespread visitation which has convulsed our Indian emnpire to its centre, whieh bas involved in ono in-disrinsate destruction the warrior and the trafficker, the -Parents and the offspring, the infant anzl-the full of days, which has traced on the darkest page of human history xt neue the depth of mazn's deceitfnlosess.ad th6 desperation f hiswiekedness,-we may say concAni that desolation 'what the patriot prophet said unde-4aralel oircuustances concerning his owa captive ity, " (i:s fathera have sinned and are nst, and we have *ms~. itheir reproach." More than half a century lhad elapsed since the establishment of British supremacy us rndia, when it was declared by one of the. most eloquent orators who ever pleaded the cause of the oppressed that if our Indian conqaests were to be &a suddenly lest as they' ba been speedily acquired, not a trace wouldl remain to show thatmpgn India had ever been held in subjection by a professedly Christian nation; and it is araong the mysteries which no humaan intellect can penetrate or explore that retribution of this wrong donoe to India should be exacted of the generation which had done more than any other to repair it. Dark periodsa there have been during which it Might almost have been said of British India as the propheRt declared of his own doomed and devoted city, ".Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem. and see how, and know, and seek the broadl plaoes thereof, if ye can find a man- if ye can find any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the trutth-and I will pardlon It." Butt it has been far otherwise in our day. The Lord haith had mauch people in India-usany who executed judgment, many who sought the truxth, many upon whom not only the diame of the Lord Jesus Christ was called, hut who reflected the lineaments of His moral imnage, because they possessed a measuxre of the miind that was in Him; and yet upon such the thunderbolt has fallen. Such the overflowing scourge had swept away; and to many who have lost their nearet and dearest uponi earth the only consolation t.hat niow remains is that which is above all price--the remnembrance that they' wrho acted as Chrisbians endured as Christians, and they' who had livedi as Christianks died as Christians and that if the righteous perished and no one lai,[ it to heart, he did not the lass surely enter into rest because his hed of death was the cismantled fortress or the crimson battle-field, and his executioner, his mnurderer, a demon rather than a~ man! What can we say, then, to these things btxt that the judgments of God are unsearchabl an hi was pst indn ot? hat can we do hut enteatHim astheprphe ~.anil dd,to behold our deso. latr,' t rear usasthepepleonwhom Hlis name is calld, o acep ou sarifce,to earour prayer, to forgiveoursin Als! w knw nt hw far our own sins may hve cntriuted o drw don upn the sufferers, this MOst appaln and unsparing ludgent. When, asI we haveher in the service ofth day, there were 1 some that told the Lord Jeans of the Galileams, whose I blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices, Suppose I ye, said the Lord, that these Galileas were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things I tell you nay; but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish. And what is the bearing of this upon ourselves, but that if we will not learn righteolusnes from the judgments that fall upon others, others may learn righteousness from our own?l While we believe, therefore, that the pestilence, the; famine, the sword, the mutiny, the rebellion are still, as they were of old, the instruments of God's wrath, the ministers of God's will, we believe also that the penal visitation will continue just so long as He hath determained, and accomplish just so much as He bath decreed. In a period of national calamity, therefore, when so maniy thousandls of our own people have fallen victimis to the destroyer, aLnd so many thousandls more are in jeopardy every hour, exposed to all the horrors that can be perpetrated by a superstitious race, sensual and debasing, combined with a system of falsehood that unfurls the death-flag as its banner and professes to propagate itself by the agenicy of* the sword, we have only to seek how the disaster may be averted or abated - we need not to seek further, we know but too well how It has been pro. voked. We are to repair to the throne of grace to help our trouble, while waris the help of us. We are to p eet our supplicationns before the Lord, not for our own righ ess~, hut for Hfis great mercies ; we are to eonfess bothtesn of our people anld our own; we are to humble ourselves, not only generally as a nation, not only collectively as a chrch, h ut separately and singly as those who have beenL partalkers of the sin, and cannot therefore but fear lest we should he involved also in the punishment. Had not the fast been proclaimed, had niot the solemn assembly been called, had not the Sovereign called uponx her people to join with herself in the act of humiliation because of their common sin, the men of Nlneveb, of whom we have heard ibis day, would have riseni up against this generation and condemnned it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and behold a greater than Jonas is here. " Behold the Lord called out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity ; the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no mnore cover her slain." But here munst he the work of the closet as well as thei work of the church, if we would mnake this a fast and an acceptable day unto the Lord,-a day profittahle to our afflicted country and to our own souls Not onily the house of the Lord, but the inner chamber of our own dwelling, must be witness to the depth of ourI humiliation, the fervour of our supplication, the integrity of our purposes, the importunity of our prayers. We must in suchwfse solemnize the fast that if further testin,'sny were wanting as to the part which we have borne in this prostration of an offending people before their God,' the atones wo4la cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber would answer it, and our peniteneo must be as practical as it is profound, our expresions as durable as they are deep. What would supplication avail to ourslves unlesa it led to holiness ; and what would intercession profit others, uinlees it wrought by love ? Ab, mny brethren, the maen of Nine'veh, that pagan city, may read us a lesson here, The judgments were in that case only threatened, and yet the i,ihabitants learnt righiteousness. Not only did they cover themstelves with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God, hbtt they turned every one from his evil way and from the violenice that was in their hands. It was not merely a confession of their sin, but also in forsaking it that they found mercy. God repented of the evil that He had said He would do to them, and He did it not. How different this from the dissembling and hypocritical Jews, who were ostentatious and obtrusive in the observance of the outward form-bowing down the head as a bulrush, and spreading sackcloth and ashes uander themn, andI making the voice to be heard aloft, whillo yet the heart was unimpressed, the conscience unawakened, the sin unrepented. BuLt wIlt thou call this a fast and an acceptable daLy unto the Lord? Oh be assured that those anid those only will have humbled themnselves effectually before God with -whom the solemn service of this day shall be the means either of ceasin to do evil or ofl earning to do well, the stimulant to duty at honie, the incentive to charity abroad. Lot us seeI to it, then, that we sball in the day some further advanee in ways of goodness, some backward step from sin, some onward step to HIeaven. Let us seek to be confirmed in every holy piurpose and quickened to a livelier sense of every spiritual obligation. When we aro so awakened to a seuse of the precarious tenure by which we hold the life that warns us to make both immediate and habitual preparation for that lilt) that is to comne, let us turn to the stronghiold as prisoners of honie lying for refuge to Him who is able to serve even to the uxttermost, and prepared to give practical proof that tiot in vain the Lord's voico crieth to the city, but that as men of wisdom we have seen His name, that we have heard the 1Lord, and remembered who bath appointed it. Hlere, thien, we are led to the practical conclusion. The purpose of the judgment is then fulflled when the inhabitants of the world learn righteousnes. And this must he doneI collectively and individually-by the nation for tempora deliverance-by tlho mian, by every one of ourselves, sepa rately and singly, for the salvation of the soul. When does a nation leamn righteousness ? When it follows the examiple of Nineveh in the humiliation ofl thae people,-when it follows the example of Jern-. salem in the self-abasemnent and prostration of. thel Sovereign. These memorable instanlces are recorded fori our adinonition and encouragement; and If no act of t our beloved Queen calls forth the supplication, the acknowledgment of the repentant David, "1Lo, I havye sinned, and I have done wickedly," yet we may gather a miost important lesson from considering the Lord's dealing with Jerusalem, the holy city, and comparn it with the case of Ninieveh, a heathen city, where until the preaching of Jonah, the very namne of Jehovah, the Most Ihigh over all the earth, was, we may well believe, altogether unknown. In the one cas, the destruction was arrested, in the other it was averted. Of the Israelites who hadl sinned, like too many of ourselves, sgainst light and knowledge, there fell in one day by the pEstilence 70,O(rO men of thme Ninevites, -who knew not until the prophet came to preach it in the moidst of them the Lord's will, and therefore did it not, All were spared, Not a hair fell to the grouLnd from any of them. So true it Is that in every nation be that fesreth God and wvorketh righteousness is acecepted with Himi, and that the aspirations of real penitence, from whatsoever clime, or city, or comimunity, never arise unheard. But so true is it alsoand this is the special lesson for ourselves this day-that in every nationithe factof knowing Goal'swilland of possessing Gc,d's law aggravates men's guilt, incoreases their peril, and entails a weightier penalty on neglecting or disregarding it. We miay, I trust, anticipate a like response to the humiliationx of this day as that which David and his people experienced at the handl of his God, when the L,ord was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. But, my brethren, if at be so indeed; if the DE stroyer, now executing the mission of God's displeasure uiponi India, bae coiimanded to put up his sjword into the sheath and to stay his aven3ging hand, let it not be forgotten that a likeo deliverance involves on the part of the resued nation a like expression of adoring thankfulness--a like memiorial of abiding gratitude, Not only did the penitent and pious monarch consecrate to the Lord the spot on which he had seeni the avenging angel and received the assurance of the pardon and mercy vouhsafed ; not only did he build here an altar to the Lord and offer peac offerings and burnt offerings, hut hethat day forth set his affecItions more reverently than ever towa,rd the hoseo his get a part of his own proper goods, oyer aDd aho-ve v ,ha&t heo bad repared, in his kingly character, for the holy cause. The immediate duty of the nation, indeed, and that to which during the present distress every other must give place, is that of meeting, on a large and liberal scale, the coint. less and complicated forms of destitution and misery which this mystery of horrors has entailed. This done, however, the acknowledgmnent of Britain should be the same in prinCiple, however varying in the development, and God is alike honoured, Christ is alike confessed, in the erection of *anctnaries for the faithful, or the provision of ministrations for them in danger to perish for lack of knowledge, or the preparation of fitting asylums for the widow and the fatberless. The nation must not think to offer sacrifices to the Lord of that which doth cost it nothing, and a light thing it is to mitigate, as far as may be, with the corruptible things, the silver and gold, the destitution of the orphan's soul, the desolation of the widow's heart, But we must learn righteousness, eah for himself. In this age, In this country, in this city, no one who would be useful in his generation and faithful to his trust can ever need to aak the question of the subtle casuist, " Anad who is my neighbour ?" No one can ever be at a loss for pious and philanthropic objects which have respect to the immediate temporal and spiritual welfare of those around him, by which he may at onoe beneit his fellow-man, and glorify the common Lord. At this moment, indeed, British sympathy traverses continents and oceans. The electric touch vibrates at tho interval of many thousand miles in the inmost heart of our own metropolis. But when the emergency is fully met, as met it will be, for every pulsation of this crowning city the heart of the nation is felt and 'esponded to by ta remotesst of its members.

This discourse wai clitfivy c,nfined to the more purely spiritual treatment of the suhject, aild Jcferred mainly to evils in our churches, a d ineth4xs of removing them. ST. ;IARYLEBONE. The Bev. Edward Headland, M.A., senior curate, preached in tl,e chulch, NLew road, taking as his text the Lamentsti(Ls of Jertniab, iii., 40 :-" Let us search and try our as s, amid turni rgsin to the Lord." I'ce preacher aeclared his belief that the crowning sin of E_eliad "I respect to India had been the godlessness o' her in.e. Me ought to recognize no distinction of caste au.org tbose who entered its civil or military service. In ce clusion the preacher referred to the dereliction of duty of thoFe at bone, and prayed that Gcod would now cause all tbhDgs to wvork together for the good of His people, and the advancement of His church. At the close of the service a handsome collection was made for the sufferers by the mutiny. ST. PETER'S. ST. MARYLEBlONE. The sernmon was by the Rev. R. Wheler Bush, M.A., from Joel. chap. ii., v. 1.5-18, "Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly," &c. The rev. preacher, after a few introductory observations, proceeded to say,-A visitation bas befallen us unparalleled for atrocity in the annals of history. It stands out in hideous i:,,lation-a masterpiece of Satanic cruelty and faitblessnse,-bursting upon us when we least expected it, in the nmidst of apparently profound tranquillity, with only ore or two fitful gusts as harbingers of the coming storm. Thbe upgzroath of our Jndian empire is a historic marvel, witbout a parallel, a record of victory after victory, from tbe battle of Plassy down to our own day, with only the Affgban and Sikh disturbances to create alarm. Well may we exclaim, "'VWhat bath God wrought!" The national heart has throbbed with pride in its contemplation. Spe. cially did we glory in our native army. And now God strikes at the very root of our confidence. Suddenly, when we least expected it, messages of woe arrive in quick succession, our native forces melt away, and horrors have been perpetrated which baffle deecription with the sad catalogue ,,f which you are, alas ! already onlytoo familiar. Why did God delegate to our nation the care of nearly 2C0,000,600 souls? Such a trust was not given as a ground of self-complacent cnigratulation, nor to gratify a spirit of covetousness. Xatber it was a solemn deposit placed in our hands because God had a special favour to us as a nation, endowed us with grea' spiritual privileges, aJid designed us to spmaed the knowledge of the true faith among the benigbtedAh9a. sands of Jnd,'.. But how have we fulfilled this trust? For long years we governed India as though our creed were a mixture of heathenism and infidelity. Then a brighter period arise in cr.nsequerceoftheeexertionsof a Wilberforce, and the sanctity of a IJ- enry Martyn and a Heber. Christianity then miiadesomneprogress. Offeringstoidols, sutteeism, infanticide, coi,fiFcation of converts' property were gradually abolished; hut still a temporizing and vacillating policy on the part of Governmurnt bas prevailed, and expediency has been almost deified. But such a negative Cbhistianity bas failed to secure the objects sought after; for both findoos and M}ahomedans, es tbusiasts in their own religion, could s fiord to smile in derision at our policy, and learnt to distrust us altogether. I believe tbat God intends to make our mercantile supremacy-our fleets that ride on every sea, our armies scattered over the face of the world-as instrumrents in propagating the true faith, till that time foreseen hy prophetic prescience arrives, when the k nowledge of the Lord ehall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. Mleanvhile, I doubt not we must follow up with punishment those fiends in human form-punishment not dictated by a spirit of vengeance, but a calm, wide-sweeping, dispassionate ordeal of justice spinst those by whom mat's, woman's, children's blood has been poured out like water, inflicted by those whoim CGod has empowered to wield the sword of justice. Let us, then, pray that a new era may dawn apon the policy of the Indian Government; and that, instead of placing before the natives the ignis fatuns of a philosophy falsely so called, we may be the blessed and favoured instruments (under God) of leading them-without violence, or corruption, or intimidation (for Christianity repudiates all such instrumentality)-to a knowledge of Him who gave Hiimself on the Cross of Calvary a ransom for all, After the sermon ihere was a collection, which amounted to 511. 10s. 3d. ST. Pl:ILIPIS, REGENT-STREET. The sermon at this church was preached by the Rev. J. M. Bellew, from Jeremiah I., parts of verses 25 and 22, The Lord bath opened his armoury; a sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction." The rev. gentleman alluded to the atrocities which had been perpetrated in India, glancing at a few of the circurastances, particularly some that had affected various members of his own congregation; after which he passed to the consideration of the moral and national bearings of the question. These were considered under two heads-the one individual, the other national. individually, the trials and troubles in India had served to draw forth character, to make real heroes and heroines of many of our countrymen and countrywomen; and, among those who were spared, it could not be doubted whatever may have been their previous course of life, many would be brought by their present afflictions to a higher sense of duty both to God and man. Nationally, the warfare in India would serve to raise England to a stronger feeling regarding her relatiovs with India. Itwould make her feel morally accountable for the charge of the mUlions of people there subject to her dominion. Our duty to India as a nation would now take precedence of our own selfish schemes of mere profit. This crisis would raise us to do everything we could to alleviate the sufferings which our national indifference to India might have precipitated ; but, above all, England would now learn her moral and religious obligations towards her Eastern empire. In conclusion, the rev. gentleman said, "I look for the proper recognition of Christianity ; for the earnest development of all the resources of sogreat anempire; for measures calculated to elevate those millions of people in the scale of civilization, I look for a determined and resolute administration in that land dedicated to the progrzess and benefit of the people themselves. I look for India being recognized as a theatre for the exercise of practical Christianity, of political justice and of British philantbropy. I look fora poHcy the first principle of which will be the benefit of India,in contradistinction to the narrow selfishness of English profits at the cost of a subject people. I know we must wade through rivers of blood before we pass the present tide of Insurrection and can lay the foundations of this reconstruction of an empire; but if we content ourselves to struggle in self-defence, to punish the bloodthirsty and to spare the innocent; it we wage war to vindicate justice and not to glut an unhallowed thirst for vengeance; above all, if we turn aside the weapons of God's Indignation, and his ansaoury is no longer opened against us for punishment by our having put on the whole armour of salvation, and having felt we must in all our acts and deeds endeavour to carry out the principles of the gospel of Christ teaching us that all our doings will of themselves fail unless His arm sustain us, and God's Holy Spirit guide and sanctify our work-if thus chastened aud taught we come forth from this present calamity, then I cannot doubt that India will one day become a blessing and a glory to this realm of England ; and we shall no more keep a day of fasting and humiliation for our sins, but rather a day of thanksgiving that the sound of battle and destruction is no more heard in the land, and the armoury of the Lord sball be no more opened against us for ever." ARCHBlSllOP TENISON'S CHAPEl, REGENT- STREET. The morning sermon was preached by the incumbent, the Rev. J. Galloway Cowan, from Deuteronomy, xxviii, BX, 59, *-If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou miayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord Thy God, then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderfuL" The preacher, after dwelling on the frequent recurrence of special fast days of late years, entered fully into the question, What bave we done as God's peculiar people to establish in India the fear of Ris name ? and showed that the sins we bad encouraged there and at home had been visited by punishment in kind. having already had a specialservice of prayer for our brethren in India, and also preached twice for the relief of the sufferers, he now pressed the duty of supporting and enlarging missions to the heathen, and called upon the congregation to make their offerings then as a part of the relJgious observance of the day, and a pledge that they would henceforth rule in the fear of God's name, The sum collected at the offertory was 191. 5& ln the evening the Rev. E. Lacey, curate, preached from Matthew vi., 10, "Thy kingdom come." ALL SAINTS' CHURCH, MARGARET-STREET. A sermon was preached yesterday morning by the Rev. W. Upton Richards in the temporary church. The text was from Job xix., 21 :-" Have pity upon me, have pit upon me, 0 ye my friends; for the hand of God bath touched nie." This was now, ho said, the cry of our country. men and countrywomen in the far East to their relations and friends at bome. Their position might be compared with that of the people of Jabesh-Gilead when the Ammonitesroseupagainstthem. "Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field, and Saul said, What aileth the people that i'they weep? And they told him nthe tidings of the men of Jabesh. And the spirit of God came upon Saul vvhen he heard those tidings, and his anger ws 3dndled g_reat-U7.-" _AlnDad -h cry of wailing bad reached us from Cawnpore and other places where the atrocities committed against our countrypeople were positively too horrible to he related. Yet it was to be feared that even these crimes would be exceeded if succour did not soon arrive at Lucknor. As we meditate upon scenes of crime and suffering like these we can hardly help trying to discover the object of the existence in the world of sin. Why does God, of whose goodness and infinite mercy we are so fully convinced, permit vice to prevail ? Such speculations have during al time engaged the attention of men without having met with a satisfactory solution. The truth is, they are beyond the power of human knowledge to solve, and one of the first duties of a Christian is to learn to acquiesce in the fact. Tbere is not, bowever, any doubt about the consequence of sin. Sin vill most certainly be attended with punishment. The supremacy of England must be aseerted with vigour and without hesitation. But as Christians we are forbidden from harbouring revenge. The reverend gentleman was throughout listened to with intense interest by an unusually crowded congregation. ALL SAINTS, GORDON-SQUARB. The Rev. A. P. Hughes, M.A., incumbent, took for his text Jerenmiah, xviii., 7 and 8, and observed that nations and kmigdoms are under the government of the Most High - that irreligion and vice are the causes of the judgments of tbe sword, &c.; that, by a timely repentance and humilia- tion, the Alight7's wrath may be appeased and the viaitaion averted, as exhibited by many examples in Scripture; that the present visitation has brought a double retribution -the sword has fallen upon us for the little effort we have made to Christianize the heathen, and upon them for their idolatry and hardness of heart, but that a golden opportunity mnay now be given us for furthering their conversion. The rev. entlsnian concluded w ith a call to repentance and examination of our on sines individually. A collection wFar made for the Soldiers' Orphan Institu. tun, amountingto 141. 21. 13s. 4id. was contributed by the inmates of the Reformatory, resw-road. ST. MARK'S, NORTfI AUDLEY-STREET. The morning sermon was preaebed by the Rev. J. W A)re, incumbent, from Nehemiah, ix., 33-35, " Howbeit h..u art jUbt in all that is brought upon us; for Thou hast 'ne right, but wve have done wick;edly: neither bave our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fatbers kept Thy law, nor hearkened unto Thy commandments and Thy testi. n onies, wherewith Thou didet testify against them : for tbey have not served Thee in their kingdom, and in Thy gr. nt Roodness that Thou gavest them, aud in the large and Sat land which 'Thou gavest before them." The eveni6g sernon vwas preached by the Rev. C. T. Iloakyns, curate, from Daniel, iv., 17, " The AMost High iuloth in the kingdom of mlen." Collections were made after the seivices in behalf of the sufferers by the Indian mutinies. ALL SOULS', LANGIIAM.PLACE. The rector, Bev. E. Eardley Wilmot, preached in the moanimg. In the afternoon the Rev. John Baillie took for his text Judges xx, 12, "What wickedness is this that is done saRnng you 9" showiDg that the crime there committed, and the duty laid by God upon Israel, were the counterparts of the crime perpetrated in India, and of the duty laid upon Ergland now. To revenge a private personal wrong Was one thing; to avenge a public crime was another. Of all passions none was so un-Christlike as vindictiveness; but the avenger of a public wrong was God's express minister, wielding iu God's name the sword of justice, and he was to see to it that he did not wield it in van. To execute an individual murderer was not vindictiveness, but a righteous averging; and to execute a body of murderers-small or great-was not vindictiveness, but a plain daty with wbich society was charged as God's avenger. In Israel a vile deed had been done by certatn miscrtants; a message was sent throughout the tribe denianding that they should be given upi the demand was resisted, the whole tribe aiding and abetting the act. Israel a.ked counsel of God ; and what was the divine decisien s No previous question about the character or conduct-the merit or demerit-of the party on whom the wrong had been done; one duty only was in the first instance to be thought ,.f-the foul enormity was to be avenged. "The Lord said, Go up against him." True, they were to take beed in what spizit they did it; hence a weeping, and fasting, and a "sitting before the Lord." But the avenging work must be done-the outraged law of society muxs be vindicated. The blow was one politically inconvenient at the moment; but it fell by God's express command. Our own case was exactly paralleL A wail had come to us across the ocean frcm the well of Cawnpore. The crime was not an isolated act of somesolitary misoreant, but Nena Sahib was only executing orders given elsewhere-the -whole Sepoy gang Nwtre deliberately aiding and abetting the crime. It was no time for inquiries into the previous morit or demerit of this nation as India's lord paramount; this monstrous enormity must be visited; these burning tears of our bereaved must he wiped; this paled brow must be brghtened again; ant the only possible method was, tho avenger must go up ng.dinst the murderer. True, it was a delicate work which England had on hand. The avenger must walk right softly, re,embering whose sword he wielded ; and it was well that to-day we were caLled to an exercise of penitence. But the avenging work must be gone through with. There might arise an inimediate political inconvenience. England might miss her Sepoys, as Israel missed her exterminated tribe. But, for the sake of that vast population of 200.000,000 of human beings, whose only hope of quietness and of lifesafety was the supremacy of law, this vast gang of murderers must be put down, and their very name become an execraii . " I think I hear." wrote an officer of engineers the other day from before Delhi, " a faint wail from Exeter. hall, and the usual talk of Euruopean brutality and torture of the mild Hindoo Sepoy." No; our wail was for the Sepoys' vntinms, for our butchered mothers, our murdered children, our darkened homes, our sad-sad-oh, how sad blanks. And the vail should not cease until God had smitten before us the branded criminal from the earth. The preacher concluded with ans appeal in behalf of the sufferers. ST. JOHN'S CHAPEL, BEDFORD-ROW. The Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel, LMA, took his text in the moruing from 1 Peter v., 6:-" Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God." His discourse was divided into three heads :- 1. We ought to humble ourselves before the supremacy and justice of God in chastising us. 2. We ought to humble ourselves before Him as accountable creatures, confessing not only the sins of our rulers, but our ovwn sins. 3. We should humble ourselves before God, as He only can bring us out of our present troubles. In the evening the hon. and rev. gentleman preached. and took for his text-" Weep with them that weep ;" Romans xii., 15. The collection In the morning was 601.; in the evening, 281. 12s. 10d. ; total, 884 12s. 10d. CAMDEN CHAPEL, ST. PANCRAS. The Rev. Mr. Fitzgerald, the incumbent, preacbed an eloquentaermon, his text being Psalm II., verse 1, "'Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? '" In reference to the subject of the Indian mutiny he remarked, the source of the heathen rage must be sought in the deadly feud which has ever been going on between ubirist and Christ's enemy. The same passions which had ileen at work in the world ever since man's fall, and had torn the heart -f man, were the very spring of that rebellion which had turned the fairest province of the British Crown into a field of blood. It would be better to look at our ow-n transgressions, which sprung from the same source, than to investigate secondary causes, with which It was the duty of our statesmen to deal. After adverting to the atrocities perpetrated by the mutineers, the rev. gentleman said-" There is a terrible work of justice, of retribution, yet to be done in India. I do not wish to gloat over it in tha spirit of revenge, but I hold it to be high rebellion against the decrees of God's own justice to prevent it or deprecate it. I would not speak of vengeance, which alone belongs to the God of Heaven, but I would pray God to permit justice to be dealt by us-that His own eternal justice, whose sanctions are ever awful and sublime, wiU consecrate the flash. ing of our artiUery and sharpen with righteousness every sabre that is drawn upon the battlefield of India. The preacher concluded with an earnest appeal on behalf of the ouffeiers. The amount collected after the morning service was up. wards of 421. ST. PANCRAS. A sermon was preached by the Rev. T. Dale, vicar of St. Pancras and canon residentiary of St. Paul's, yesterday morning. The text was taken from Job xxxiv., 2'J and 33, *- When He giveth quietness who then can make trouble-t and when He hideth His face who then can behold Him whetber it be done against a nation or against a man only 1" "Thatjthe bypo.ite reign not, lest the people be ensnared." The collect?on in the morning amounted to 1341. 16s. lid. OLD ST. PANCRAS. The Rev. Cornelius Hart, M.A., incumbent, preached, from 2 Chron., c. xv., v. 1 and 2, " And the spirit of God came upon Azariab, son of Oded. And he went out to mest Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah sad Benjamin. The Lord is with you while ye be with Hwm; and if ye seek Him He will be found of you; but if a e forsake Him He will forsake you." The preacher read a part of the proclamation, and observed that the nation was assembled that day in the house of prayer to acknowledge its sins, its justly-deserved punishment, and that all its dependence was solely on the merciful kindness of God. The doctrine of the text is that God is with us while we are with Him: and this doctrine is enforced, first, by a gracious encouragement, " If ye seek Him He will be found of you " and, secondly, by an awful threatening, "If ye forsake hlim He wiU forsake you." God does not forsake us before we have first forsaken Elim. The preacher then read extracts from a Memoir of Ec&esiastical Establishments for British India, published by Dr. Claudius Buchanan in 1805. To this he added extracts from the preface of The Indian .Bmpire Illtstrated, by Mr. R. Montgomery Martin: and these, too, he said, were confirmed by an article in The Times of Friday, October 2, in answer to a correspondent signed "P.," showing that in the government of India we had virtually forgotten God, and the Christian religion had been discountenanced; and the truth of the text had been verified in the experience of the British empire. He concluded with an affectionate appeal for our suffering aiid bereaved brethren in the East. The collection, the greater part being in the smallest coins, amounted to 51. 14s. 9d. ST. MATTIHEW'S, OAKLEY SQUARE, ST. PANCR&S. The Rev. Charles Phillips, M.A., Dreached from Jere. miah xiv., 7-9 :-'IO Lord, though our iniquities testify aigainst us, do rnou It for Thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many ; we have sinned against Thee. 0 the hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, &e." The preacher considered, in the first place, the penitent confession of the text. Ournational sinsweremany and great; throughout the land the authority of God vwas set at naught, His vord despised, His sanctuary neglected, His Sabbaths profaned, His mercies abused. The spirit of avarice, too, under the plausible name of speculation, had been let loose upon the community. All religious principle, all holy consierations, were o6ered up on the shinue of mammon. Our scanty weights and measures, our adulterated goods, our shops open on the Lord's-day, our bands in the Parks,-all testified against us. The preacher then dwelt on the iniqui- ties that testified against us in regard to our Indian empire. India had been numbered amongst our dominions for a hundred years; yet, while we threw obstacles in the way of the Christian religion, we actually gave our support and encouragement to the false religions of the country. When it was proposed at first to propagate the gospel in India a cry was raised by interested men that any attempt to Christianize the people would be attended with civil commotion and tumnult. Cbaracteristic and pertinent was the reply of the great Duke of Wellington to a ohaplain in the service. When the latter asked hira what was thease of preaching the gospel to the heathen, the Duke replied, "What ar7e your marching orders ? Are they not, G(o ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature ? Is not this a duty incumbent on every Christian people?" After an, earnest practical application of the text the discourse was concluded by an urgent appeal on behalf of the sufferer. The collection after the sermon yielded 331. 5is. 31d. ST. STEPHEN'S, PADDINGTON. The mnorniDg sermon was preached to a large congregation by the Rev. H. Brooks, M.A., incumbent, from Zechariah, L, 15. The preacher passed over the theological puzzle of the text, and under two divisions, of God's sore displeasure and God's slight displeasure, spoke of the normal state of heathenism, of Its outbreak in the present calamity notwithstanding that British rule had placed India at ease, of the want of Christian firmness in that rule as dishonourable to God. The last point was fortified by an extract from 2%ce Times of the 2d inst., and the preacher closed with an earnest appeal for support to the Indian Relief Fund. The morning collection amounted to 1081. ST. STEPHEN'S, WESTBOURNEPARp., PADDINGTON. The morning sermon was preached by the Rev. Harvey Brooks, M.A., the inoumbent, from Zechriah i.} 15., " I nm very sore displeased with the heatbeut that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forwari tre affliction." The preacher passed over the theological puzzle of the text, and spoke, first, of God's sore displeasure and, stcondly, of God's slight displeasure as connected with soume facts of tbe Indian disaster. Under the first division he inquired for what and by whom was the Divine al ger excited? For deeds more than barbaric, diab.,]ical. By the heathen now manifesting this Satanic itood. That mood had been described as the normal state of the Indian mind. If normal, why ? Because heathen. The preacher dwelt much upon the assimilation of character tetween the worshipper and the object worshipped; and by rdTereace to the old mythologies to the hideous system of Bindooism, and to some statements of Dr. Living-E s-one, proved that the peoples which had false, im-I pure, and cruel gods were themselves the creatuares of bad passions. The Indian wickedness was perpetrated by a people at ease ; for, however faulty Britibh rule, it was benficent compared with that of the native dynasties. I Under the second division the preacher spoke of our own provocation of the Dtvine anger as confessed in the services of the day. We dishonoured God by weak concession to native prejudice. This position was fortified by an extract from a leader of Te TYmes of the 2d inst. Let there be no religious crusade againat the prevailing superstitions, but let a Christian government avow its Christianity, refuse tribute to idol temples, and protect Christian converts. The conelusion was an appeal for contributions to the fund for the Indian sufferers. TREVOR CHAPEL, BROMPTON. The Rev. W. Al. Statham preached from the Ist Kings, chap. 8 verses 44 and 45:- If X hy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever Thou shalt send them, abd shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house that I have built for Thy rname, then hear Thon in Heaven their prayer and supplication, and maintain their cause." Solomon's prayer is not only comprehensive in its character, embracing various aspects of individual and national life, but it recognizes God's power to deliver from all calarcities. The text recognized- 1. The possibility of war. 2. God's hand in war, "whithersoever Thou shalt send tbem." 3. Our duty in war; prayer in Gods house. 4. Our end in war to maintain the cause of justice and right. KENSINGTON CHAPEL. The Rev. John Stoughton preached from Ecclesiastes vd, 14th verse :-" In the day of adveraity consider." The preacher classed the considerations suggested by this day's adversity under the three heads of human nature, Divine government, and present duty. He first; referred to the atrocities perpetrated by the mutineers, and then to the heroism of the sufferers, as illustrating two sides of human nature; and dwelt on the power of Christian faith to uphold the mind in times of calamity. He, secondly, viewed recent events in connexion with the Divine government, remaTking upon the difficulties which they presented to reflective minds, and then vindicating the Divine righteousness and mercy in their permission; and, thirdly, he strcr,gly urged the duty of devoutly aclknowledgig th hand of God, of abounding in earnest intercession, and of acting, as well as praying, especially in reference to Indian affairs; the improvement of private character and public morals, and the helping of those who have suffered from recent events, ST. LUKE'S, CHELSEA. A sennon was preached by the Rev. C. Parsons Hobbs, from I Kings, ix., 8, 9:-" And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss: and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and to this house? And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brough forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have ;taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them a er them; therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil." lhe preacher, at the close of his discourse, said, that if good springs out of evil it had been good for the heart of .:ngland to throb with generous impulses for their relief and consolation whom this appalling visitation had stricken down to the earth; and, having appealed to his congregation as part of that England whose heart feels and bleeds at the bare recital of those deplorable afflictions which, after all, we can do so little to alleviate, he showed them that to have pity and to show mercy on such an oocasion was patriotic, human, religious, and Divine. The large church was filled in every part by a most attentive congregat on, and the collection at the close of the service amounted to 731. 17s. 9.d. ST. JUDE'S, WHITECHAPEL. The Rev. Hugh Allen, incumbent, preached from Jeremiah ix., v. 1:-" Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people." Four subjects should claim our consideration this dary First, we should lament the disasters and the deaths of such numibers of our fellow-countrymen. The circumstances connected with these scenes in India are peculiarly distressing,-the awful suddenness of the events; no one appeared prepared. Then the fearful atrocities connected with the same-the maltreatment, butchery, and murder of women and children; and, besides all, the fearful number of deaths of both sexes and all ages. Nor should the sorrows and bereavements of the families of the brave soldiers who fell, either by treachery or in battle, be forgotten. The second thing to be considered is the remembrance of our own sins; that, indeed, is the meaning of a day of humiliation. We, as Protestants, do not pray for the dead (they are now beyond our prayers), but we p ray and entreat forgiveness for our owvn sins. 2N.ationally, ecclesiastically, and personaUly w e have not done what w.e ought to have done, and wre have done whatwve ought not to have done in many things Thirdly, the sinners should be considered-and these are, not only the mutinous Sepoys and the rebelious Hindoo and Mahomedan natives of India, but our own nation, our Christian churches, who have done comparatively so llttle in the missionary cause, and ourselves individually are each blameable on this and on many other other accounts * for instance, what an awful thing it Is that so immensely rich a country as England should have in the mridst of their own people at home such an amount of crime, demoralization, and poverty. The fourth and last thing to be considered is, what is to be done now and by-and-by.I ay now; the ordermust not be inverted. There is a time for everything. This is not the time for mnutual recrimination, but for universal humiliation before God, and, by individual and urnited effort, to support the Government not only by prayers, but by immediately forwarding and sending out to India aU the men and all the money that can possibly be raised, and, by a prompt effort, to do all in our power to help our countrymen and countrywoomen in India, who are thegreat sufferers at this time; and then by-and-by our Government, our churches, and all our associations for foreign and home interest should aU institute an immediate and efficient reform in their proceedings. After the sermon there was a collection for the sufferers in India. DE BEAUVOIR CHURCH, HACKNEY. Two sermons were preached in this church yesterday by the Rev. W. Stafford Finch. The rev. gentleman selected the 1st and 2d verses of the 38th Psalm for his morning's discourse:-" 0 Lord, rebake me not in Thy wrath; neither chasten me in Thy hst displeasure. For Thine arrows stick fast in me, and Thy hand presseth me sore." God (said the preacher) uses mortal trials to discpline and correct us. Families and nations are alike tried for want of a faithful oiseharge of the duties required of them. National judgments are the instruments of God's moral discipline over States and Empires. When His good gifts are misused prosperity is withdrawn, and ruin follows. For example, the great landmarks of nature remain as they were of old; the mountain chain and the mighty river are still found as they were when Cyrus or AlexaLnder trod the earth, but the traces of the political divisions which they marked out have long been obliterated. Even the colossal empire of Rome has crumbled into dust because it despised the laws of God. England has nos given a mother's care to her colonies, and God's judgments have followed in war, defeat, and alienation. With regard to the mutiny in India we cannot deny that gravo errors have been committed, from the consequences of which 'we are now suffering. Blame may be attached to us for endeavouring to awaken a land which has slept in Heathenism to the light of Christianity. When the present horrors have been put down we then shal have an arduous task to perform to cultivate the respect of heathens; but we must not compromise Christian truth. We must uphold the majesty of the law against rebels and murderers; we must recover that power which has been sbakento its base by an atrocious mutiny. To-day lt us humble ourselves beforeMGod, and beseech him to protect us from again falling under so severe a punishment. The rev, preacher concluded a most a o quent and earnest address to a devout congregation, asking their aid to relieve the distress of our brethren in Indha Collection, 21)1, 25. 3d, The evening service w as wvell attended. ST. JOEN THIE BAPIST, HOXTON. In the morning the Rev. AL P. Kelly, M.A., incumbent, preached from Jonah iiL, verse 5.-" So the peoplecof Xineveh boelieved God, and proclaimed a fast,"l In time of national calamity the people of God in all ages have set apart a day for humiliation and prayer in order to obtain the pardon of their sins and the blessing of the Almnighty. The case of Nineveh is an illustration of the efficacy of thus prostrating before God. Accordingly, our rulers at this time of national disaster have proclaimed a fast, regarding, and that rightly so, that the fearful mutinies in India are a judgment from the Most High. In the evening the Rev. R. H. Baynes, B.A., curate, took for his text Psalm x-vi., 6 :-" Thy judgments are a great deep." Whatever our different opinions may be as to the fearful occasion of 'his day's ser'-ices, we cannot bnt feel that it is a great and goodly sipht to see England, tho prince among the nations, bowing low in supplication before the great Lord of all. Thero is bope in the spectacle this day exhibits, for what is the nation's deepest utterance at this time but that she acknowledges her entire dependence upon God, and asks His merciful pardon for talents neglected and opportunities thrown away? To what purpose were our great Indian possessions entrusted to us but to scatter among its teeming population the healingmessage of the Cross? But how sorely have we failed! We have regarded it as a source of wealth, have sown broadcast over the land our national vices ; but how little have we done for God's saving truth ! Let this day's work, then, be real and hearty, A loud cry comes to us across the sea-wailings of woe and anguish from souls smitten down with grief. Lot that cry reach every heart to-day, and let us in a true spirit of self-sacrifice pour our offerings into the treasury of God, and, too, pray we earnestly for Englan dthat she may awake to her solemn mission. But she may repair the sloth and utter carelessness of the past by sending forth that Gospel of mercy which is the only remedy for a guilty world. The collection in the morning amounted to 13t. 5s. 4d. ; a collection waa also made after the evening service. CH c RIST CHURCH, HOXTON. iAt this ohurch the sern on ias tho morning was preachad which each of us is put in tust by God and with which eternal interest the universe itelf, with all that it oontains, could not for an instant be held in equipoise,-"For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and Ieee hisownsoul?" O,then,letthevisLtatton whiohwenowdeplore, and for the removal of which we are met to entreat theLord. bethe means of drawingChristians into more close and Intimate membership eth each other, arisigc out of a oloser union with Christ, our common Lord. We have heard across the ocean the voice of wailing, the sound of the musket, the alarm of war; destruction upon destruction is cried, for the whole land is spoiled. Suddenly are the tents spoiled, and a voice Is heard as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her fLrst child; the voice of the daughter of ber that bewa'leth herself, that spreadeth her hands, and that saith, "Woe is me now, for my soul is weary because of murderers." And what saith the voice to them? It saith to him, who finds his chief earthly happtness in the most endearing and most enduring of all social ties, that at any instant, and by a visitation, as signal and as sudden, the desire of his eyes 3nay be severed from him at a stroke. It saith to the fond parents rewarded by a numerous and promising offspring, that their dearest and their loveliest may be torn under by a separation that embitters death by dishonour, and leaves thFm to go childless to the grave. It says to each of us, that the beloved who is as our own soul, may occupy tomorrow the grave that is not open to-day; or, like the victims of a treachery and cruelty which have no parallel in the annals of mankind, may be despoiled even of a grave; yea, it says to each, "Be thou ready also, for tbe Son of man cometh when thon thinkest not." 0, then, let the unforgotten solemnity of this day-a day long to be remembered as well as devoutly to be observedcall upon every one of us, with a voice that shall penetrate to our hearts and pursue us to our homes, to provide against the peril of family bereavement by the Practice of family religion, The altar reared in the domestic circle is the most sure and effectual protector of those who are encompassed by the divers diseases and exposed to sundry kinds of death. How can those endure to part In the morning without mutual supplication and intercession who love each other more tenderly than the whole world beside but who know not when they part, even for a few bref hours, whether they shal ever meet in life again? How can those endure to close the day without the mutual recogniton of the Lord Jesus as their common Saviour$ the =esurrec. tion, and the Life? "Behold, the Blridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet Him." Lastly, let this day be a call to provide against personal visitation by personal religion. In the day of adversity, consider: consider thy preparation for death, thy provision against judgment, thy prospect for etermty. What wiU it profit a minister of God s word, if it be the power of God unto salvation, and yet lie is himself a castaway? What will it profit the parent, if he behold his children afar off on the bosom of Abraham, whither he himself can never come? " Oh then ye who would escape judgmient learn righteousnes.f" If there be any who, when God has spoken to themn in their prosperity, have replied, "I will not hear, let them hear now; it may be the last, the only time"-let them hear the voice thAt caJls to them as to children, pointing to Him who Is made unto al who believe wisdom and righteousness, sanctification, and redemotion. Let them hear the voice of Eim who would welcome them as a pardoning Saviour, and not deal with them as an inexorable judge. *Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts." Let them appeal to the Lord that he may have mercy upon them, and to our God that He may abundantly pardon, and then, even if the respone to this day's humiliation be not the deliverance of an afflicted nation, it will be to himself the salvation of an awakened soul. It only remains that I call upon aU here present to give proof of the sinoerity of their prayers-to make this a fast indeed, and a day acceptable to the Lord, not only by contributing to the relief of the sufferers in India, but by recognizing the special ground on which they are caled to do it. Those for whom I ask your sympathy are our own flesh; they are our own brothers, kinsmen, equals, friends. As in Egypt there was not a house where there was not one dead, so in England there is scarcely a family which has not some relative to deplore; while as to the sad survivors, sonme of whom, alas! have been exposed to IndigRnities worse than death, they verify the lamentable words of that pious patriot who exclaimed, " Oh, that my head were water and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the star of the daughter of my people." They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills; their inheritance is turned to strangers; their houses to aliens; they are orphans and fatherless; their mothers are as widows, And will, any hearing this, hide himself to-dayfrom hi- own flesh? Will any one of this assembly, the very poorest of whom ought to have spared something from the absolate requirements of the flesh, leave this place without an offering when the cause that is pleaded is his own? If so, though the judgments of God are abroad, he bath not yet learned righteousness, and if he will not learn righteonsness, which alone dehvereth f rom death, oh ! what will he do when the day of visitation is his own? To all and to each here we say-Hide not thyself from thine own flesh-mete to thy fellow-sinners and fellow-sufferers with that meausre wherewith thou wouldbt, in the hour of thy necessity, that it should be measured to thee again. Sow to thyself in righteonsness, that thou aiayest reap in mercy. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. During the morning the Rev. W. Calvert read the lessons and litany. The collection amounted to 541. In the afternoon the colection amounted to not quite 501, the total of both collections being 1031. 2s. The Rev. B. M, Cowie read prayers in the afternoon, and the Rev. J. V. Povah the lessens. The anthem was "Give peace in our time, 0 Lord." Both In the morning and afternoon the "Dead March" was performed. WVESTMINSTER ABBEY. The Past Day services in Westminster Abbey were yesterday attended by numerous and devout audiencoes, the whole of that portion of the Minster usually devoted to the service, andthe wide space extending to the north and south transepte, being densely fiUed with worshippers. In the morning the prayers were read by the Rev. Canon Lupton and the lessons by the Pev. Precentor Hadeu, The sermon was preached by the Very Rev. tho Dean of Westminster, who; took as his text Lamentations L, 40 -41:-" Let us search and try our ways and turn again to the Lord. Let us lift up oiur heart with our hands unto God in the heavens." It was hardly necessary, he said, to remind them that they were met together for a purpose that well became a Christian nation-to acknowledge God's hand in al that we suffered. and that they might ask Eim by prayer and timely repent. ance to cause Eis displeasure to cease from us. It was the character of ungodly men that they would not see and acknowledge God's judgments; but the godly were privi. leged to see His footprints asHe walkedunseen injustice and in mercy throughout the earth, and they could hear the rustling of the skirts of His garments as He moved mysteriously throughout the world, dealing according to their deserts with men and nation. As a consequence of this they accepted their evil and their good as alike coming from the hand of God. It wasgood thus to recognize God in the good and evil that befeU us, for both brought with them their several blessings. Sorrow, adversity, and paia often brought to individual men rich blessings, especialy when, In the words of the prophet, they were led to "search and try their ways -" and having searched and tried them were led to "turnagaintothe Lord." In the days of our prosperity we easily acquiesced in the existence of our present corrnptions ; we forgot our sins, and it almnost seemed to us as if God was conniving with those corruptions and had also forgotten our trespasses. We al too easily forgave ourselves those faults that God in his Providence seemed to be forgiving us; but when He smote us, when His judgments overtook us, then how much was remembered that hut a little before 'was altogether forgotten ? Numerous transactions that had been well nigh effaced from the tablets of memory flashed out again in characters of fire. It was not till perplexity and dist.ess had overtaken the sons of Jacob that they remembered and mourned over the cruel treatment which they had inflicted on their brother Joseph; and It was not till the Angel of Death had passed over the threshold of the widow of Zarephath, that she remeiuberod herforgotten sins, and called to the prophet, "Art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son ?' What was thus true of singlo men was true also of nations. They remembered theirsins in calnmity and forgot them in prosperity. Nations could not, any more than individuals, endure a long course of palmy and prosperous days. Some were more corrupted by prosperity than others, but aU had need of disappointments and reverses that they might be brought to sit humbly in the dast and acknowledge his hand. the cup of affliction came in due time to all. `o single men it cams^ in the shape, it might be, of strength turned into weakness, of undutiftlness of children, of the unkindness or estrangement of friends, of the taking away of those who were bound up with us in the bundle of life; or It came perhaps in somne strange and unwonted shape, for the resources of God were inflinite, and in a thousand ways He could mingle that one drop of bitternesm in the cup of a man's life that would turn It al to wormwood and g *LL Among nations affiictions came in the shape of desolating pestilence, wasting wars and famines, the domination of the stranger, oivil commotions and intestine broils, clss alieuated from class and coming into hostie oollision, so that the peace and harmony of nations was broken up and destroyed. They all remembered how nine or ten years sinece it fared with England when the storm of wild revolution swvept over Europe-when thrones of a thousand years caine tottering down, and the fair capitals of Europe fell into the hands of brutal and violent men. They remembered how Enigland satunebaken and unmoved-her temple of freedom safeaud unviolated-how she sat asaQueen, and saidperhaps in her heart, "II sbaU see no sorrow." But now all was changed. The other nations of Europe were at peace, whilo sorrow and angu3h had taken hold of us in England. We were now, as then, a spectacle to the world, but the nations we then pitied were now pitying us, or, it might be, speculating on that downfall that would not come, and saying in their hearts, "Now is she lid waste." Why had God visited us thus ? Surely suchi a time of visitation must have serious and solemn thoughts that belong to it. God was speaking to us-not maerely to this nman or to that, but to all, and it was necessar to remind them of the duties of such a time, because it was a great mistake to suppose that God's chastenings were sure to do the work for which they were sent-they we:o only beneficial to thoae who, in the words of the Apostle, " ere exercised thereby." Two dangers menaced us in regard to this. In the first place we might defy God's chasteninga. They had read in ancient story of a fierco tribe rho, when it thuxdered, shot their arrows and threw their javelins in defiance against the sky. It was thus with some men now. Thevrwas no brokenness of heart, but rather defiance; they,were stricken, but not grieved. There were those wbo sai4. " Th'e bricks are fallen down, but we wilt'. build with hhesFntoners; the sycamorcs are cut down, b-.&. we will changg. them into cedars." Nor need it be as 4- posed that Ais defiance would of necessity take the shar d,0i cpen blas:Jtuxy and speaking great things agaistGo *j -the voice of the harvest-the voioe of joy and gladnessthe voice of triumph is heard from the conquering army on the baUlefield-the voice of the harp and fute from the well-lit up mansion in the evening when the busy traffic of the day is past. But there is another voice, which we have heard and felt-the voice of suffering; night and day it is heard-all other voices are hushed at timea-the voice of sufferng never. From the velce of Abel's blood ,to the present hour, the same voice s heard-from across the ocean deep and loud it comes, and groans for the shelter of the grave. England can tisten to the voice from the battle-field unmoved, but the voice of injured murdered innocence is acup too deadly to drink. But yet another voice, 'Vengean¢e is nmine, I wiUl repay, saith the Lord.'" He then pointed out the many national sins coUmitted by the people of this land, and said that any mercy we received at God's hand would not be for our own righteousness, but his own free gift. The conduot of our ralers in regard to the demon worship was then commented upon, showmig that they regarded not the voice of the servants of God, until the voice of thunder shook Heaven and earth-the voice of the offended and disregarded God. The great lesson that voice proclaimed to every person in the British world is that "It Is better to trust iU the Lord than to put any confidence in Princes." If India's Govern. rneat had taken for their guiding star that simple motto of faith uttered by the huable fisherman, " We ought to obey God rather than man," that was the foundation the Apostles laid; but India reversed that motto, and God has overturned the mighty superstructure reared thereon. Be oncluded by sayingthatif God gives back India to Enland another foundation must be laid, and that is, "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put any confidence in Collections were made after each service, amounting to 854 6s. ld. BERESFOED CHAPJEL, CAMBBRWELL-GATE, The sermon in the morning was preached by the Rev. W. T. Maudson, B.A., incumbent, from Psalm lxxix., 9-11 - "H Help us, 0 God of otr salvation, for the glory of Thy name; and deliver us, and purge away our sins, far Thy Name's sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? Let Himbe known among the heathen in our sight, by the revenging of the blood of Thy servants ,which is shed. Let the sighing of the prisoner come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy power, preserve Thou those that are appointed to die." Ascribing our present disasters to our national sins, the preacher remarked that the individual sufferers were not neoessarilythe greatest offenders. Probably, thoughEuropean residents in India bad their share of guilt, those who had so miserably fallen were victims to our forgetfulness of God in England. There had been a sad lowering of the Bible standard, both in recent legislation and in the general conduct of the population. Among the heathen, too, we had seemed afraid to honour our God ; and, so far from attempts to propagate Christianity having been the ground of the mutiny, we had provoked the Lord by a less determined respect for "tbe glory of His name "than was shown even by the Hindoos for their idols. Pointing out God as our source of help, the rev. gentleman insisted that vengeance is His attribute, and, after an exhortation to indi. vidual repentance, conoluded by an appeal for pecuniary aid. The colloctions were devoted to the general fund for the relief of the sufferers. - YORK-STREET, WALWORTH. The sermon was preached by the Rev. P. J. Turquand, founded on Lamentations ii., 40:-X 1 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord." In the introduction it was proved that all are in their measure responsible for the sins of the nation, that the nation may be considered as one body with various members, and therefore it was the dauty of all to acknowledge sin. The collection amounted to 25M, FOIUNDLING HOSPITAL CHAPEL. The Rev. J. W. Gleadall, X.A., preached from Luke, chap xiiL, v. 4:-" Those eighteen upon whom the tower in loam fell and slew them, think ye that they were sinnersabove all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?" After referring to the Indian mutinies and their attendaut horrors, the distress and astonishment they had created in this country, and the mingled feelings of indignation and sympathy they had excited, the rev. gcutleman said-The questionis in what light are they to be viowed? They have heen called a judgment of the Almighty. It is very easy to call a calamity, personal or national, a judgment There are some who never witness an affliction befalling their neighbours or even themselves, without instantl; declaring it to be a judgment of the Almighty. Suoh people hardly ever think of God except as cEastising, ai wielding the rod, as dealing out judgments. But genuine piety is not based upon fallacies and delusions. But Christ ha taught us a diviner lessen. He has consecrated human sorrows, lifted them out of the degraded and debasing level of mere chastisements,and clothed them with a d{gnity,an elevation, and a nobility of meaning,whichgivesusto understand that we may still be the objects of God's ever-watchful care and love although affliction may be our portion. And this terrible visitation utters a voice of warning to which it will be well for us to attend. I believe that the authority of England in India has been the source of many benefits to the masses of the people, in extending to them greater security for life and property. But has not England made the love of money too much her ruling principle there ? Let her learn a holier lesson from this dispensation; let her learn wisdom, and juwtice, and moderation; let her daily consider the designs of Providence in clothing ber with so vast a power,and appreciate the great responsibilities which the possession of that powrer involves; and then, by tho blessing'.ot God, these terrble calamities may be made the starting poit of a nobler career, and open out a brlghter future both for India and for ourselves. LICENSED VICTUALLERS' ASYLUM. TheRev. W. G. Martin, M.A., performed service four times in the chapel of this asylum,-viz., prayers at 8 am., full service at 11 3.m., prayers at 3 p.m., and full service at 7 p.m. The attendance at the whole of these services e denced how deeply the inhabitants of the neighbourhood felt the importance of the occasion. The rev. gentleman, taking his text at the mid-day service from Isaih, xxvL 9, "When Thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness," delivered a discourse in which he dwelt mainly upon England's unfaithfulness to her trust, in not having more abundantly imparted the light of the everlasting Gospel to that benighted land. The congregation was fta too large for all to be accommodated with seats. The collection at the close of the service in aid of the Indian Fund amounted to nearly 151. SCHOOL FOR THE INDIGENT BLIND. A sermon was preached in the chapel of this institution, St. George's-fields, by the Rev. B. G. Johns, Chaplain. on Hebrews xiii., 3, " Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them, and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves in the body." The preacher proved that never throughout the history of oar country has any calamity ever appealed to us vwith so loud and terrible a voice as the sufferings and fate of our fellow-countrymen and countrywomen in the East; that as nothing could exceed the cold-blooded atrocities and fiendish malice inflicted onour helpless women and children, so their blood cried to Heaven for vengesnce from God, and to us His instruments for executing swift and stern justice on all who had shared in treachery, outrage, and murder not to be paralleled in the records of human crime. He next traced in brief outline the rise of the English power in India, its chief features of excellence and of error, success and failure; and then strongly insisted that, whatever such errors or vicious elements might have been, the present sufferers were guiltless In every sense, and, though innocent, had suffered death of such intolerable shame and agony as to raise them to the rank of martyrs in the noblest mneanlng of the word. The rev, gentleman concluded by showing thatEngland's mision was doubtless to reclaim these kingdoms of darkness and of Satan, and bring them beneath the sway of truth, light, and knowledge by a might greater than her owfn, which can alone triumph. A collection ws made in aid of the Relief Fund. MILITARY COLLEGE, ADDISCOMBE, A sermon was preached at Addiscombe by the chaplain, the Rev. W. H. Johnstone, M.A., yesterday evening from Matthew lx. 15D:-" Can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegoom is with them ? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast." The maxim here delivered by our Saviour is, that in every fast the outward expression of mourning shouid correspond with some really existing grief, otherwise it is a mere lifeless and meaningless form. We do right therefore in wearing the conventional garb of mourning for the loss of a friend. Christians act consistently in fasting for their sins if, and only if, they aotually feel sorrow for their sins. A nation publicly professes its sorrow for a public calamdty with perfect propriety when the calamity has indeed fallen heavily upon a large portion of the nation. We fasted and niourned for the plague, for the famine, for the war, and now for a more dreadful national misfortune than any which haveyet preeoded it. But, moreover, Har Majesty's Proelamation, and the words of the special service, require us not only to weep and mourn, but to seek pardon for our sins; and this we must do, not with the foolish belief of Baals priests, that we can turn God from His purpose by our cries, but with the earnest intention of finding out God's purpose, and then of setting ourselves to carry that purpose out, We must bring toreinembrance such of our national sins as may have been concerned in this national dla.sfv . anA we must do our utmost to avoid those sins for the fiu e What have We then, all of us, been doing, that, in order to tear us out of our sins, the most merciful message that God can sesd us is to make our friends pasa through a very sharp martyrdom, and to rouse a wail of horror from one end of Great Britain to the other? The sin which we have to consider should from the nature of the cse be striotly national and notorious. It muat be such as may have influenced our dealings with Iadia, and be such as our calamity may bring to our minds and induce us to abandon. Now, our sel -indulgenoe and love ol money fulfil these four conditions. It has led, in extreme cases, to many instances of commercial dishonesty; and in more than one quarter it hias been pointed out ra sappirg publio virtue, There has been too much of this sn iu our connexion with India; but the crisis we are now passing through will go far towards changing our whol tone if we submit to the chastisement God has sent us Again, we have been too much in the habit of prophesying smooth things, of calling crimes and vices by the names of Prejudices nd errors We are not, however, likely to speak smoothly of this terrible catastrophe. But chiefy we have not paid sufficient attention to our own Christianity. W ought to have been more careful of letting the heathen know how vavstly superior Christianity is to their foolish or wicked religions This is a subject that peculiarly touches us. We Ought 3n future to see that our coantrymen going to India are, at any rats acquainted with the principles they profess The eyes of the world are upon us, for the great exponent of pablc opinion ha said only the other day, Theperilhas been created, not by the presence of Christian misionaries, but by the absence of Christian soldiers," ST. JOHN'S, CLAPEHAM The evening sermon was delivered by the Rev. -Tames Kelly, M,A. Text, 2 Samuel, xvi., 11 and 12, "Let him slone, and let him carse; for the Lord hath bidden him. It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that the Lord wil requite me good for his cursing this da." The preacler compared David in his prosperity, raised to -" We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from Thy preceptsand Thy judgments." Several prevalent sins were mentioned, and the people exhorted to acknowledge themii in confession to God, and to forsake them in newness of life. The sum of 191. 10s was collected after the services. 431. had been previously transmitted to the fund from the ofiicers and children of Christ's Hospital, who form part of the congregation of Christ Church. ST. BENET, GRACECHURCH-STREET. The Rev. C. Mackenzie, A.M., rector, preached from Daniel, vi., 20. "1 Is thy God whom thou servedt continually able to deliver thee from the lions P" After a preface suitable to the occasion, the preacher drew three considerations from the text-siz., 1. That the severest trials happen to men of piety and faith, which he illustrated from Scripture and from modern history, also pointing out the signs of fidelity and piety exhibited now in India - 2. That our God is mighty to deliver; 3. That the best way to secure help and deliverance is to serve God contnually. After showing that all need exhortation to repentance, Christian life, and prayer, the preacher concluded with earnest appeaL "I Mothers (he said) have given their sons, we mnst not refuse our gold." ST. MICHAEL'S, CORNHILL. Sermon by the Rev. Thomas Wrench, from Genesis iv., 10-" Thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." The discourse was thus divided :-I. That it is incum. bent upon all Christians, in their private capacities, to abstain as far as possible from revenging personal injuries and wrongs. 2. That it is the province of "the Powers tbat be" to execute God's justice in the earth, inasrauch as they bear not the sword In vain, both for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do welL ST. MAGNUS THE MARTYR, LONDON-BRIDGE. The Rev. Dr. M'Caul took for his text Psalm xliv., 1-4, observing that they were assembled at the bidding of the highest authority in the land. The Sovereign of the greatest nation under heaven humbled herself before the King of Kings, acknowledged her own impotence and His power, and called upon her people to unite In humiliation and prayer. The people heartily obeyed the calL The Royal Proclamation only expressed the deep and pervading feeling of the nation. We were suffering under ca6amity. We felt there was no help but in God, To Him, therefore, we appaled. We, like lsrael of old, had had conferred upon us the high commission of being a kingdom of priests, Our wondrous empire in the East was God's gift; we won it not by our own sword, as the history of British India made evident. It was given to us that we might teach the nations the way of salvation. We had proved unfaithful to our trust. We had rather helped idolatry than Christianity. The Lord had let loose upon us that idolatry; one of the greatest oalamities that ever befell the nation had come upon us, nearly touobing the happiness, the honour, and dignity of the British people. We acknowledged God's hand. He had sent it. We called for mercy and help. No nation ever cried in vain. He had strengthened the hearts of a few of our countrymen to withstand, and enabled them to triumph over armies of aliens. He would hear onr prayers and bless our hosts now going forth if our appeal to him was in earnest. This must be shown in the sincerity of our repentance, national and personal-and in our sympathy with the sufferers and afflicted who had borne the punishment for the nation's sins. The church was well attended by a devout and serious congregation, including many of the humbler classes of the people. The morning calleetion was 291. 8s. ST. MATTHEW, FRIDAY-STREET. Two sermons were preached by the Rev. W. Sparrow Simpson, the reetor,-in the morning from Daniel ix., 18, 19; and that in the evening from Acts xiL, 5. The preacher in his morning discounrse spoke of the necessity of prayer that our land may grow in religious stature, that her piety may be commensunrate with her power, her charity with her wealth, her love for God's church with her desire for temporal dominion. The unutterable horrors, of which we had lately read so much were the genuine results of idolatry. The ospel is the only medioine for India's deadly sickness. We must build our churches there as weU as our factories, send out our missionaries as well as our collectors of revenne * not only our brave soldiers,but that valiant army whose only weapoa is the sword of the spirit; not only our nobles and merchant princes,but our bishops, priests, and deacons. Christ said, baptize aU nations; man says, conquer all nations. The Apostle said, we seek not yours, but you; man says, we seek your land, your wealth, but not your souls. It was hardly surprising that in the first burst of indignation men should talk of revenge rather than of justice, but calmer thought would bring the remembrance of Chriatian duty. The noblest revenge is to deliver from the chain of error those who have so long been bound by Satan, to render blessing for cursing. The preacher expressed a fervent hope that brighter days were yet in store for India, and concluded with an earnest appeal to the charity of Christian people, founded on the contrast between their ease and comfort, and the terrible sufferings of our brethren in India. The subject of the evening sermon was intercessory prayer. The services were attended by large and attentive congregations. ST. MARGARET PATTENS AND ST. GABRIEl, FENCHUROH. The Hon. Artillery Company attended this church, where the sermon waspreachedby the Rev. J.H. Knox, curate, from Psalm ciii., 15 and 16:-" As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he fiourisheth: for the wind passeth over it and it is gone, and the place thereof shaU know it no more." The preacher drew a comparison between the sudden death of our fellow-countrymen in India and the probability of the day of zbe Lord coming as a thief in the night to all. He then led the subject to Christ, the Rock of Ages, who alone was to be trusted both in time of war and peace, remarking that there was no fear of death in a true Christian, but rather joy that his course was run. The rev. gentleman also advocated the extension of missionary labour. After an appeal in aid of the sufferers the sum collected amounted to 171. 7s. 5d. ST. ANDREW UNDERSHAFT. The sermon in the morning was preached by the Rev. F. G. Blomfield, M A rector from Psalm lxxvi., 10. "Surely the wrath of man stall praise Thee; the remainder of wrath shalt Thou restrain." The preacher dwelt at some length upon the misrule that had taken place in India, and the neglect of England in not providing spiritual assistance for the infidel tribes in the East. The Rev. A. Povab, IM.A., lecturer, preached in the evening from Chronicles IL, xx., 3 and 4. " And Jehosaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughont all Jndahb and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord." A liberal amount was collected after both services, ST. BOTOLPH, BISHOPSGATE. The Rev. Thomas Hugo, senior curate, delivered a discourse to a full congregation from the Daniel ix.,8 :-" 0 Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kiDgs, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against The."' The chief aim in the sermon was to pro ve the necessity of dass of public humJilation in caseso pblic calamity to bring to our remembrance our individual as weU as our national sins, and to seek forgiveness of the same. The preacher referred to the general opinion of foreigners, that Englishmen, though boasting of being the most religious people on the face of the earth, exhibited in too many cases very few signs when abroad of what they professed to be at home; alluision was rmade to the many charges of misgovernment of India, which he feared in some instances it would be difficult to disprove, A smm of 291. 9s. was collected. ST. JAMES, ALDGATE. The sermon was preached by the Rev. W. Meynell Whittemore, rector, from Psalm lxv., 5 :-" By terrible things in righteounmess wilt thou answer us, 0 God of our salvation." All terrible tbings are the vehicle of Divine utterances. Not only in the thunder when it rolls, but also in the madness of the people, when its hot surges sweep along in consuming fury, God speaks to us. He has spoken terribly to us in India. The Divine utterances, so eloquient in terror, are responsive to the voices of our transgressions, Apply this thought to India. Men have said, "We wiU seek riches as our great object " yet the savings of years have been wasted in a moment and the Exchequer rings with an empty sound. Men have said, "We will seek wealth in neglect or denial of Christian obligations; " the rabblo from the gaols scarcely ever reached by Christian teaching and the soldiers zealously guarded from Christian proselytizers are the only persons now seeking our lives, Men have said, " We are verv clever in our governmental policy," yet that policy has but organized an army and given it weapons that both its tactics and Its armoury may be employed for our destruction. Mark how terribly God not only speaks, but answers us! All this is in righteousness. The appolntment of a national fast Is a proof that we recognize God's justice in these terrible things. Yet there is mercy as well as righteousness in this Divine response. Mercy-for we recognize as the speaker the God of our salvation. ST. SEPULCHRE, SNOW-BILL. The Rev. James Jaokson, M.A., vicar, preached from II Samuel, c. xxiv., v. 14, " And David said unto God, I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the hand of the Lord, :or his mercies are great, and let me not fall into the hand of man." The rev. gentleman observed-" Vhat It is to fall into the hand of man India can now bear witness, wi.%ere scenes have been enacted which wil form one of the darkest pages In the world's history. In falling into the hand of man, as we have done, it is some consolation to think that our enemies have not been driven to revolt by any oppression on our part, or any wrong they can justly coimplain of. On the contrary, their conduct has not been more faithless and savage than ours towards them has been humane, kind, and confiding. And in justice to those who have been responsible for the government of India it must be said that the British rule has been the best and most beneficent which that country ever experienced. The mercantile and industrial part of the population feel this, and their sympathy is vith us and not with the mutiny. But where our sn seems to be is in not attending to those higher and holier purposes for which India was given to England; which were, not only to give us wealth and luxuries, but to enable us to spread among the heathen the knowledge of the one true God and His son Jesus Christ. Without any attempt at compulsion, which no one would advocate on such a question, and with. cut any interference with free will to accept or reject, we have not done what we might to present the faith of Christ to them by the fair ncouraeent o missionary effort, or the careful exhibition of the Christian life in ourselves. With more earneatness about our own faith we might have been more respected; with the extreme deference we have shown to their idolatries and supertitions, we have found at last only insult and outrage. If, when this calamity is overpast, we are more true to ourselves and our God, our rule in India will be blest both to them lnd to us; otherwise, we may one day find again to our cost that ' the dark places of the earth are full of crueliy.' " The sermon concluded by a statement of the distress which has beeq cauased by the mutiny, and an enumeration of the classes I who have suffered, together with an earnest appeal in aid of the fund for their relief. Collection, 191. 4si. POULTRY CHAPEL, CITY. The Rev. James Spence, D.D., minister of this Nonconformist sanctuary, preached from 2 Chronicles, xs., 2 and S. He discoursed, first, on the circumstances in India which have led to this national fast-a revolt marked by fiend iLh cruelty, diabolical crime, and the vilest ingratitude; fillinthe nation with anrprise and dismay. Second, the grounds of our humiliation under these circumstances. It is extrem MI and false to say that our rule in India has been systemati cally wrong. Yet there is much to humble us. Oa' possession of India has been marked by 1, inordinate secular, selfish ambition; 2, by more or less politic'. error; 3, by decided religious cowardice, cringing t superstition, and hindering our own Divine religion; and 4 by moral inconsistency. Thirdly, the conduct requirei of us. The puttng down of the mutiny in justice ani mercy, but not in vengeance, and a manly Christian 1 government in future. The congregation was large, and the collectionm amountad to 35l. 5Bs. ST. MARY-LE-BOW, CEEAPSIDE. The sermon was delivered by the rector, the Rev. M Vine, who took for his text the 3d chapter of Lamentations, 41st verse:-" Let us lift up our heart with our hand i unto God in the heavens." The preacher inculcated the neeesinty of heart worshipi and the inutility of mere formal phrase in our addresses toI God, on the present occasion in particular, and, after dwelling at some lengt7h on the utter inefficacy of man's efforts unattended with the Holy Spirit of God, deduce I frons his theme an argument for more I;mportunate entreaty. ST. JAM1ES, GARLICKEYTHE, UPPER THAMIE3. The Rev. Thomas Bnrnet, D.D., F.R.S., rector, took his text from Jeremiah, xvi., 7 and 8.-" At wha: instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concernine' a kingdom, to pluck up, and to paUf down, and to destroy it; if that nation a ainat whom I have pronounced, turn from their evii, Iwi1A repent of the evil that I thought to do unto The preacher expatiated on the horrors of the present rebellion and mutiny in India, and concluded with a few sentences of admonition and encourageement. ST. MARY'S, ALDERMABURY. The Rev.iC. C. Collins preached from Psalm xlvi., 10, "Be still, and know that I am God." Alter analyzing the Psalm, the preacher pinted out its application. Overruled by the power of God, he believei that every struggle advanced the progress of truth. Ba; however great our ground of confidence as to the finall 7'ssae. "when the ki ngdoms of this wrorld shall become the k;ing.- dom of our Lord," stiLl, as individual branches of the grea; vine, national chastisemesnts called for individual expressions of sorrow, without which faith in the ultima ta triumphs of Chr7stianity was only a form of presumptioa. It WaS8 then shown how Divine judgments often take tha form of the very evil man-hoped to avert7. Not only is th, blowv struick in a quarter leist expected, but, if anly sacrifics of principle has been made, by the hand of the individes: whose goodwill has been thus conciliated. EDnough, it was said, has been done and auffered in India to show that neither our intelligence nor our might coald stay the hand of punishment when through omission or commission we had deserved it. Man's duty, therefore. under chasisement, is to be still-still in penitential sorrowv for all his short comnings. Then he might hope that infinite wisdom would overrule the blackest deeds, an i navtienal sorrow issue to the exaltation of God's name. Lest on this day of humiliation any should be disposed t.) think he had no mnterest in itb dut'ies, the people wvere reminded of the luxurious spirit pervading all classes, b7 which unhallowed competition, fondness of sipeculation, ant * covetous desire to be rich at any price were engendered, t thle destruction of social happiness, and of that sympathy which ought to exist between employer and employed, with a practical exhortation to repent in t7rue humility, and to take up some good work as a means Of st7rengthening ou: sense of duty. The sermon concluded wiith an appeal in bahalf of the fund for t;he relief of the Indian sufferers, which was liberally responded to. ST. AlNDREW'S, HOLBOREN. The Rev. J. J. Toogood, rector, IsiA. preached from Psalm vxxiv., 20 :-"The dark plares of tle earth are full of the hiabitations of cruelty." The preacher, after giving a brief account of the manner in which E ngland became dominant in; India, remarked,Thus*and atthat time India fell under the power of England. But now the Miahomedans, sapported by the Hindoos, are endeavouring to throw off our dominion, The dhiet agents in thts outbreak against constituted authority are the native army-not the inhabitants of the country generally, w7ho knowv faUl well that they have derived great advantages from our mild and peaceful rule, but a part of the native army, consisting both of Maliomedans and Hindoos-men organised and trained to arms by ourselves, They have headed an insurrection having for ivs object the total annihilation of outrpower, the vdping out; our very nams from among them. Our owrn soldiers are fighting against Us, and their acts are marked by a cruelty surpassing all that history records& These mutineers have violated all the customs of war; they have risen against and murdered their.- own offScers, who, f rom their great but rois placed conSidencs int'veir men, would not in {some instances believe that they weore in any 'danger and seek safety in flight. They have violated all the law/s of humanity, divesting themuselves of the distinguishing characteristics of' civilized men; they have excited each other to madness; they claim a ferocious kindred with their own savage animals; they are as bloodthirsty and insatiable as the tigers in their jungles;* they have ceen guilty of atrocities horrible beyond conception, which must and wQI be dreadfully atoned for by the cruel and sanguinary miscreants who have committed them. But what is to be said and done?7 Are we to give up lndia to some other Power, either foreigzn or native! W e thinzk not. No other foreign Power could do more for India than we have done. We know that India has prospered greatly under the rule ot England; her people have enjoyed a state of security which they never knewv before. Forelg Powvers see and acknowled'ge that this is a struggle of barbarism against civilization, of error against truth. The opinions of foreign nations are with us; but if they wvere not we should never quietly resign India to any other European Power. Andus to the other question-whether or not we shaUl retire before any native Powver and give it place-whether the spirit of our people, with their love of freedom and their' sense of truth and justice, shall be dominant, or whetherI Isome heathen nation, crushing in one hopeless chaos of vice and cruelty all civilization, aUl truth, and all humanitv, shall rule in India-it wrould not take us long to decide. We must hold the ceuntry for its own good as well as for our own honour. The collection was 221. 5is. 2d. ST. A NNE: AND AGNES, WITH ST. JOHN ZACHARY, ALDERSGATE. The sermon was preached by the R~ev. J. V. Povah, rester, from St. Matthew vi., 24, "No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other;ye cannot serve God and mammon." The rev, gentleman said,-" England's great shortcoming with respect to India is, that while, in a worldly point of view, her government has been mild and bneficent, she has not been true to her religions principles as a Christhan Goverument, but has been unwisely and unmrorthily indulgent towards those hideous native supverstitions, which are not only diretly offensive to the principles of our holy falth, but are degrading and demoralIZingintheir effectnupon the feelings and manners of the people themselves. As men firmly believe, so wll they generally act. We forgot this in outr government of India. By trusting power, therefore, to heathens, and by withhold. ing from them, at the same time, the Word of God and the principles of Christianity, which alone can lead men to use power aright, we committedi the great error of puttting weapo?ns into men's hands which, according to the creed and principles of unenlightened heathenism, they would he sure, when the oppcortunity offered, to use against their benefactors, It isone of the mysterious dispensations of Divine Providence that this heavy calamity should have fallen upon our present generation, when mnen's minds are beginning to be more opened to the responsibility, both as Christian individuals and assa Christian people, of providing the best possible means for evangelizing the heathen in the East. Itlls sad, also, to reflect that some of our Christian missionaries, according to a recent statement from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, should have fallen martyrs to the Christian faith at Delhi and Cawnpore by the wild and unrelenting bigotry of the mussulman sword. This is only one instance out of many of which the history of nations and of families is full, ins which children are visited for the sins of their forefathers. M ay we of this day profit from the lesson," ALLHALILOWS TE[E GREAT, CITY. Text.-Esther viii. 0. " For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people?p or how can I endur to see the destruction of my kindred?9'"r The Rev. Gee. hansflel the retor, preached the sermon. He dwelt chiefly on the power of intercessory prayer, and Illustrated from the overthrow of the plot to destroy the Jews in Persia in Queen Esther's time, the expected orerthrow of the present plot in India. The collection amountedto 41. 0 4d. ST. MARGARET, LOTHEBURY. The Rev. W. Goode took his sermon from Lam,. iii, 40, 41-" Let us search and try our ways and turn again to the Lord, Let us lift up our heart with our hands untj God in the heavens." The preacher, auter an exordium pointing out the vlgilance with which the eye of God observes the acts aui. conduct of his creatures, especially with regard to their treatment of his covenant of mercy in the Gospel, proeede i to notice the duties to which the judgments of God call mankind, as pointed out in the text. These, he stated, were self-examination, Inquiry into the reasons for Ged's judgments, both as individuals and as members of the nation ; repentance and contrition; earnest prayer that God may remove His judgments, avert from us others that we may have deserved, and enable us to live more consistently with our character as by profession His children. Having enlarged in general terme upon each of these points, he proceeded to remark upon the particalar circumstances of the present time. The root of the evil lie3 in the want of a recognition of the fact that men are in reality no better than what their professed prinoiples make them. If the principles of a man's creed teach him vice crulty, disloyalty, selfishness, thesocietyinwhiohsuohamaic is found is safe only so long as there is some oounteractinZ influence t,o preven.t such principles breaking out into action. To come to ourselves, what are the duties (said the preacher) which a review of those things and the recent events which have happened in India enjoin upon us? Humniliation and confession first for our own sins, and then for the sins of those with whom we are nationally connected, united with earnest prayer for Divine mercy in the removal of tbe visitation, and Divine grace to enable all of us to act more worthily of our caling as the followers of Chrlst. Judments rightly received and met by humiliation before God
STREET PREACHING IN BBLFAST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE, TIMES. Sir,-I am sorry to trouble you on the subject of a leal brawl when overy heart is anxiously beating about the in. tereste of our Indian empire and the safety of our gallant countrymen imperilled in the m idst of such hordes of bar. banans. But, as street preoaching in Belfast has occupied, notwithstanding, so large a share of public attention, and as tho circumstances connected with it are not at all understood, will you kindly allow me to put before the public a few fActs on the subject? Everybody reads Thc:Times, and I answer all misundersiAndings by a statement in your columns. The population of Belfast is about 120,000. The Romish part does not exceed 40,000. The largest numerlhal element here Ls Presbyterian. The Roman Catholics almost aU belong to thelworking classes. They are an immigration; they are ignorant and intolerant; dependent on their Protestant neighbours, and ungrateful in the extreme. There are 30,000 Protestants who have no church ac. commodation. Open-air preaching is designed to reach and save them from surrounding demoralization. We choose for it the most retired places near the public promenades, or on the borders of dense populations. The former was the kind of place I selected for my open-air service on the 6th of September. I stood on private ground, 13 by 22 yards in extent. It was all occupied. My congregation stretched for 40 feet across the street, leaving about other 50, affording an easy passage to all who ohose to pass. The thoroughfare was open in all directions, -Roman Catholic. who did not like to listen could have easily passed. But ,hey deliberately planned an attack on us and marched a good Irish mile from their own quarters to effect it. Officials connected with the Ulsterman, the organ of the Popish mob, directed its manosuvres. The lVorthern Whig, in a series of articles, had offered them every encourage. mnet, and suggested the modee of attack. A more unprovoked, wanton, intolerant, and savage thing could hardly be conceived. I did not preach a controversial sermon. We do not preach such sermons in the streets. We want to reach the careless and the ignorant, and they want the very first principles of Christian truth and duty. It were unwise to engage such people with controversy, and we accordingly abstain from it. No sentence I uttered afforded any pretext to assail us. Roman Catholic congregations here frequently project uipon the thoroughfares. I have often had to step across whe street that I might not disturb them. I never considered myself aggrieved by that, and in the exercise of a civiU right, and the discharge of a Christian daty, I claim, when I put them to no greater inconvenience, equal toleration. They reaUy must be taughtthat this isa free country, and that they must contemplate Protestant liberty without such disgraceful ebullitions of temper and violenco as they have recently exhibited. There is an ultra-Radical, Romish, and revolutionary | faction here which has marshaUed the mob against Protestan, ISberty, law, and order. The Northen Whist and Ulsterman and a relic of the Ballingarry rebeUion-one John Reaplotted and planned for us all our reeant misfortunes. A letter which I have addressed to Lord Carlisle, and published in tho Banner of Ulster, I have sent to you, that you may have a glimpse of the doings of the three worthies I have named. They want to assume a dictatorship in Belfast. But Belfast knows them, and does not want it. They did all the mischief they could, and exaggerated the reality to something like what they intended. You may be sur. prised to hear that the damage done to property in all the iiots does not exceed 1506., and no loss of life has been authenticated throughout them all. The worst effort of the Romish mob was made on the 6th of September on my open-air congregation, but the cool courage of the people defeated it. I understand that up in London there yo' thought we were in a dreadful condition. WYe were no doub, iU enough, but we were not so bad bEt that your apprehensions of our state considerably amused us. Nine-tenths of Belfast would not have known anYthing of the riot but for their newspapers, and the world would never have heard of It but that the revolutionary factiou I have named had an interest in the affair, They want to have certain changes made in our loeal authorities, and they deliberately planned and perpetrated a breach of the peace to prove that other guardians of it were needed, that they might secure from the Government coneession to their demands. If you could find anything to do for the editors of the NVorlthsc Whig, Useman, and John Rea up in London there we could well afford to spare them. If the people here embraca religion their influence is gone. They deride it, and hence their opposition to street preaching. But we are in no way iati. midated by them, and will discharge our duty to the poor In defiance of their fiercest wrath. Their policy is to convert every street preaching into a "riot," that the Govern ment may be obliged to put us down. They meditate aggres sion on our liberties and mean to deprive us of our rights Just take a little compassion on us, if you please, Sir, and after a few strokes from your powerful pen our tormentors will perish from the stage of their misehievoas existence, You will thus serve the sacred cause of freedom ; and the Gospel having free eourse, thousands will realize and rejoice in the precious blessngs it bestows.

LONDON, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1857. MAr. HANNA is in the position, by no means uncommon, of having worked a question to an unsatisfactory result, and wishing now to try it on again. It was a very fair object of curiosity or spiritual zeal to ascertain whether the populace of Belfast would stand street preaching. Problems of this sort occur every day, and adventurous gentlemen who wish to make a move in favour of their party or their opinion i make a demonstration, and see how it will take. Thus the Romau Catholics get up a procession where and whenever they can. They convert a school procession into a religious procession, or manage to make a detour of a hundred yards from one door to another, or half the length of a by-street. Another instance is the general movement lately made in favour of preaching in such places as Exeter-hall, the Surrey Gardens, the Crystal Palace, Athenmeums, Town-halls, and other public places. It is a question beforehand how it will take, and can only be settled by trial. Street preaching has been tried accordingly in a good many places with various results. The more general result has been, that even when the preacher was a favourite and the hearers well disposed the novelty soon wore off, and people found nothing was gained by standing in the cold to hear what they had heard a hundred times before sitting in the warm. As for the unconverted, for whom this new ordinance was specially intended, if they came once or twice, that was as much as they could bring themselves to do, for they are just the people to give themselves no more trouble than they can help. Our elder readers are aware that the thing has been tried over and over again, and that the trial has always been permitted to work itself out. Thirty years ago Beatswain SMITH used to preach on bits of green and out-ofthe-way places, and was not interrupted, though if the smallest disturbance had arisen he would have been civilly requested to suspend his ministrations. That was the rule. If no harm came of it the preacher was let alone ; if a row ensued he was stopped. Of course, the preacher remembered the proverb which warns a man not to offend the multitude of a city, and took care not to provoke hostility. The chances of such a question would vary according to the locality. The mora good there was to be done, the less easy it might be to do it. Thus, if a teetotal orator took up his station in Seven Dials, he would certainly find ginshops to put down, but would probably be mobbed. M:r. HANNA knew his grow,d at Belfast. He knew the numbers, the condition, and the temper of the Roman Catholics. Knowing all this, he thought he would try the effect of out-door preaching. Re tried, was mobbed; the peace was broken; life and property were rendered unsafe; the experiment was thus proved a failure, and MIx. HANNA has been requested not to persevere. It seems to pis a very simple affairl nor do we see how the public peace can be rmaintained in any other way. In matters of this sort, which depend on numbers, temper, and very often the character of the man, it is impossible to lay down a general rule. The only rule is that of results. Can you do it, or not ? Try it. The trial is made in one place, and answers; in another place, and does not answer. They tried preaching lately in our parks, but for every good Christian who preached the Gospel there came another man who preached quite as cleverly against the Gospel, or against Government or HER. MAJEsTVs Throne. This would not do; so all preaching was stopped, though some people thought it hard. Mlr. HANNA thinks it necessary to analyze and denounce the causes and authors of the failure in his case. He makes out a most horrid, bloodthirsty conspiracy, against him and the truth. He believes that the people opposed to him are of that degraded class who earn their bread by honest toil. He believes that they have even had the audacity to come to Belfast in quest of uieful employment, to the great injury and discredit of that town, and the great inconvenience of all good people. He believes that they are ignorant and intolerant, dependent, and ungrateful in the extreme. Mr. EWsN-A thus knew the vicious and dangerous characters he had to deal with-men who actualy worked, asked for work, came from a distance for it, and put themselves into a state of dependence for it, and had the gross ingratitude not to leave their souls in the hands of their masters. But if Mr. HxNNA knew all this why did he apply the spark to this magazine of combustibles? Having done so, having made a conflagrration, and burnt his own fingers, why is he not content to let ill alone ? The worse the people are the greater the folly of persevering in a course which only exasperates them. The deeper the conspiracy, the more atrocious the chief offenders, the more besotted the instruments, the stronger are the reasons for keeping Mr. HAuiNN within the doors of his own chapel. VIRGIL relates that when iEEAns was trying to stand his ground against the captors of burning Troy, his good genius mercifully lifted the veil from his eyes, and showed him the dread demons exhaustir,g their rage on the devoted city. Instead of the spectacle stirring him up to greater efforts, it had the contrary effect of determining him to get out of the place as quickly as his legs would carry him. Mr. H A, according to his letter, has been able to pierce the darkness and see the authors of his persecution. From the character he gives to them and the populace of Belfast, we should judge that they would continue to interrupt his preaching. So the guardians of the public peace have only done their duty in stopping him. Indeed, such is the force of this gentleman's arguments, and so decisive in aU respects is the result of the experiment against its repetition, thatHmR fAJESTY'S Government have determined to take the most effectual steps to prevent such proceedings for the future. A flaw in the first proclamation has now been corrected, and some townlands in the suburbs of Belfast have been included in the prohibition of arms. It is also stated that the LonD-LruurExxAT of Ireland has decided not to put any gentlemen on the commission of the peace until they have given an assurance that they do not belong to the Orange Association. No doubt, there are gentlemen who will think this quite as hard as being hindered from preaching in the streets in the neighbourhood of a Popish rabble. They don't see the reason of it. They have a right, they think, to belong to any political society they please, so that they do not plot against the Constitution or commit an actual breach of the peace. Government, however, is answerable for the peace, and is bound to be more cautious and prospective than suits the ardent temper of Protestant zealots and Orange Lords. It has to take into account not only actual disorders, but also what may lead to them, and what may needlessly provoke political strife. Nor is there any hardship, that we are aware of, in securing the Bench from the influence of the Orange Association, or in requesting preachers to confine themselves to their own pulpits. An Irish Protestant gentleman can do much more to spread his religion by personal influence, by prudent conversation, and by leading a regular, religious life, than by drinking any number of toasts, making any number of speeches, and uttering any number of anathemas in an Orange Association. M)r. HA2exA, too, can preach quite as well indoors as out of doors, and if he will only preach to the heart he will hardly fail of a congregation. He may then follow the example of the Papists, and open his doors, so that he may be heard in the streets; and if his out-door hearers should happen to extend half across the roadway, the Papist rabble of Belfast are not likely to molest them.
What a curious and amusing collection could be made of all the different excuses which people have for not giving when called upon ! We do not at all mean to throw discredit upon this department of human ingemnity; nobody can say that it is not wanted in these days. We can all speak feelingly on this subject. But, if the assault is formidable, the defence is not unequal to it. WVe are up to the emergency. The art of excuse has grown up in accordance with the great remedial laws of nature. Nature throws up her earthwork instinctively in the direction, whatever it may be, in which she is threatened; the tree sends out its incrustation of bark to meet the wind, rivers make their own banks, and the wound throws out its own covering and protection. We shall therefore say nothing against this useful art-we could not get on many days without it, those of us, at least, who want to see their way at all clearly, and like to have six months of comfortable subsistence before them. There are many forms of speech which are used on these occasions; there are elegant and inelegant, new and old, fresh and trite, sympathetic and businesslike modes of declining to open your pocket. True ingenuity frames its excuse so skilfully that it never appears an excuse; everyreason is stamped with the siucerity of nature, and sends away the claimant, not only satisfied, but pleased with you. Indeed, many a non-giver is a more popular man than a giver. But those who cannot make good excuses must make bad ones, for it is very hard that we should be robbed of everythling we have because we are not clever. But there is nothing which may not be abused. This very useful and laudable art of excuse-this system of self-defence against pecuniary claims, may be carried to excess. There are some persons, for example, who declare summarily and comprehensively that they have made a rule, and that their rule is not to give to anybody or anything. Others never have any money, and are always in debt to their bankers. Others have always a fit of indignation when they are asked to give to anything; they suddenly remember wrongs and grievances which are wholly insurmountable, and operate as a summary check upon their munificence. Their warnings were neglected on such an occasion; somebody said something of them which was false, calumnious, and treacherous; there was gross mismanagement; there was misapplication of funds; this or that person was passed over in spite of their recommendations, and therefore they cannot think of supporting the charity any longer, This c3nstantly recurrng indignation whenever a claim of any kind is made on their pockets ii a favourite piece of tactics with many. It has all the advantages of the " rule" and the " banker's book," and it has, moreover, this peculiar advantage, that it makes the man who shuts up his pockets the injured party. So far from others having any right to complain of him, he is the true object of sympathy and compassion; he is the true sufferer. It is astonishing what a martyrdom is involved in a man thus simply keeping his money in his purse; what a sacrifice it is not to assist your neighbour in his extremity I Archbishop CuLLEm has, we observe, adopted the latter form of self-defence against the intrusion of the Indian Relief Fund. One did not expect to see this treated as one of the ordinary intrusive claims of the day; but so it is, and the Roman Catholic Primate of Ireland prepares to meet it. He instantly becomes angry, he summons up a fit of disgust and indignation at England and the India Company, and Protestantism, and the "Patriotic Fund," aud the "Wellington Col- "lege," and the " Cambridge Asylum for W Widors, " and the " Naval School at Newcross," and the " Female School at Richm raond," and the " Naval and Military Schools " at Plymouth and Portsmouth." In aU these institutions and charities he declares that the Roman Catholics have been ill-used and cheated; that they have not had their share of the benefits of them; and that where they have been admitted the charity has been used as a machinery for proselytism; that " not a shilling has been voted to " give a Catholic education to Catholic orphans ;" and that, in fact, these are all Protestant charities for Protestant purposes. Until al these institutions are put on a new basis he will not recommend the Irish priesthood " to "take any step in the matter of the Indian "Reliefj Fund, or call on their flocks to do "so." Now, it is quite impossible, of course, that aU these institutions can in the course of a month or two be wholly altered and put on such a basis that Archbishop Cu=N wiU be completely satisfied and not have a word of complaint to make against them, and therefore this postponement of the Indian claim til this result takes place is a postponement of it ad Grwecas calendas. This is Archbishop CvLr.xN's mode of meeting the Indian claim. He does not talk of his " rule" or his " banker's book," but the convenient fit of indignation is assumed with great effect. Hle is immediately too angry to give a farthing to anybody or anything connected with England. He rakes up a whole catalogue of imaginary grievances; he accuses all the managing Boards of our IMilitary Charitable Institutions of bigotry and dishonesty; he charges the East India Company with Protestant proselytizing. It is not, of course, necemsary that we should formally contradict all these ridiculous complaints. Everybody knows that it would be impossible, at the present day, for the managers of public charities intended for aU denominations to spite Roman Catholics. English public opinion would not allow it; it demands the most complete impartiality in the administration of these funds, and nothing would raise a cry so immediately as the discovery that any one suffered an injury on account of his religious opinions. As for " the continual complaints of Catholic Bishops "and missionaries in India about the attempts "made by the East India Company to proselytize," we may safely leave such a charge to be answered by its own folly. Does the East India Company meddle -with theological controversy? Is that at all a characteristic of the Company Has it not got something else to do than " proselytize T" But the truth is, the Roman Catholics-so far, at least, as their priesthood represents them-do not eare about patriotic charities. There was Cardinal WISEM&A. the other day protesting loudly about his patriotism, and indignant that the least reflection should be thrown upon it. He declared the depth of his sympathy with the stfferings of our countrymen in the East. And how did he show his patriotism and his sympathy with those sufferings when it came to acting ? By enjoining a collection for Roman Catholic missions. Archbishop CULLEX takes the same course, and will not allow the money of the Irish Catholics to go to a patriotic charity. But what is this but to say that they leave the Roman Catholic soldier and sailor exclusively toProtestant charity ? It would really seem they are so sure that these will beprovided for out of that source that they will not waste their money by applying it to so secular a purpose, but give it to Romanist missions instead. Well, if this is so, it is no sueh compliment to come from our determined Romanist grumblers. Here is a man denying Protestant charity, and declaring that the Roman Catholic gets no share of the benefits of any of our professedly open institutions, and that he is leaving his poor co-religionists wholly to that charity. This is either a very inconsistent act or a very cruel one. If the Archbishop thinks his poor co-religionists will not be taken care of by English charity, then he is very cruel in throwing them altogether upon English charity; if he thinks they will, then he totally negatives and gives the lie to his charges against that charity.
Those continental politicians who attribute althe troubles of Europe to English cliplomacy must regard with satisfaction the respite -which has taken place in the baneful activity of our Government. It is no secret that the national attention is for the time concentrated on India. Holstein, Naples, and even the Danubian Principalities, have fallen at present into the background. As far as we are concerned, the most unbroken harmony may prevail from the Channel to the Baltic and the Black Sea. If any disputes are still unsettled atd menacing, the fault must lie with the Sovereigns who have lately perplexed courtiers and journalists by their visits aad interviews. After all, it would seem that Eturope profits little by its temporary relief from English interference. Two great potentates have met at Stuttgart, but politicians are uncertain whetlher their friendship has been promoted by personal intercourse. A third Emperor arranged a separate meeting at Weimar, in the hope, it is thought, of reviving the extinct cordiality between Austria and Russia. At the same time a semi-official French journal publishes a manifesto against the policy of Vienna, and proposes the establishment of a virtually independent State, to be formed by the consolidation of Mlolda-via and Wallachia. There is fortunately no reason to fear that any existing complication is likely to result in war. The interests at stake, even where they are intelligible, are not important enough to require the decision of arms; and all States are impressed by recent experience -with the wastefulness and unpopularity of military indertakings. It is strange that the sag,acious Government of France should pledge itself unreservedly to the project of erecting a Rouman kingdom on the frontier of the three Empires of the East. The traditional policy of NAPOLEON was followed up when the Russian passage of the Pruth was considered a sufficient cause of war. The connexion of the Principalities with Turkey was rightly considered tbe best security against their absorption by a more aggressive Power, and subsequent experience eonfirmed the expectation that in this quarrel at least Austria would necessarily be found on the same side with England and France. Accordingly, the invaders were compelled to retrace their steps, while they underwent the additional mortification of seeing the provinces which they evacuated at once occupied by a neutral force. The original cause of the war had ceased to be operative almost before its consequences were exhibited in the deadly conflict of the three nations under the walls of SebastopoL The peace in its earliest form of a preliminary proposal was negotiated by Austria, then united by the closest understanding with France. There can be no doubt that it was the first wish of the mediating Power to secure the Danubian Province. against future encroachments. Care was taken even to extend the boundaries of MIoldavia by the reunion of a part of Bessarabia; aud in all the subsequent discussions it was unanimously assumed that the Principalities were once more to be placed in a relation of feudal dependency on the TurkiBh Empire. The eagerness of the majority of the belligerents to conclude a peace induced the diplomatists assembled at Paris to leave parts of their work imperfect, and to refer certain points of detail to aministrative commissions, but it was necessarily taken for granted that no difference of principle remained unsettled. It is impossible to believe that the Plenipotentiaries intended to leave it an open question whether a new kingdom as populous as Belgium should be erected on the Lower Danube. The absolute Sovereigns who by their Representatives took a part in the deliberations can asuredly not have sanctioned the reference of so grave a question to local assemblies elected by the provinces themselves. The necessity of providing for the future constitution of the Principalities arose from an incidental circumstance. If Rusaia in crossing the Prath had simply invaded a part of the Ottoman territory, the obvious result of a peace terminating a successful war would have been the restoration of the province to its proper owner. The question was complicated by previous Russian encroacbments, and by the treaties which had in some cases given them a legal form. Under the Conventions which were abrogated by the late war Russia had acquired a protectorate over MIoldavia and Wallachia which involved a limitation of the sovereign rights originaly possessed by the SuxLTA. The triumphant allies of 1856 thought it right to substitute fresh securities against Turkish misgovernment when they deprived Russia of her former power of interference. It was on this ground that the Congress of Paris justified the appointment of a commission to regulate the internal affairs of the Principalities. The great Powers of Europe had stepped into the place of the Protector of the Eastern Christians, and the Ottomau PoRTX consented to allow its allies the same privileges which had been formerly extorted by an enemy. Commissioners were to ascertain the wishes of the Rouman population; Divans were to give their suffiages; but the ultimate decision was reserved for the Plenipotentiaries at a future Congress. England has no interest in the matter except to prevent the extension of Russian dominion, and to promote the commercial prosperity of aU the districts bordering on the Danube. Russia, as the principal object of suspicion, has adroitly kept aloof during the discussion, allowing France to assume the patronage of a project which seems remote from any intelligible French policy. The Austriau Government protests loudly against the creation of a second Greece on her frontier; annd Turkey, notwithstanding successive changes of M1inisters, steadily rsists a scheme which tends to the partial dismemberment of the empire. The opponents of the union may at least allege that the measure which they oppose is an arbitrary contrivance inconsistent with the purpose of the war, and an afterthought suggested subsequently to the negotiations for peace. *WiWore disputants are equally matched in power, the probability of success is always on the side of those who, having most at stake, are consequently most thoroughly in earnest. Austria may be less influential than France in general European politics, but her territories adjoin the provinces, which on another side border upon Turkey. Even if a new throne were erected at Bucharest for some mushroom prince, he would find his position unpleasant, with two unfriendly neighbours and one indispensable and irresistible patron. The meeting of the Emperors at Weimar, coinciding with the demonstrations of the French press against Austria, would seem to point to the same solution of the difflculty. It may possibly be true that the removal of Count Buoro is the price of the reconciliation; nor is it the business of a foreigner to dweU on any sacrifice of dignity which may be involved in any similar concession; but it is scarcely credible that the Sovereigns should have met only to ascertain that their differences were irreconcilable, or that the Emperor FRANCIS JosErnI should have withdrawn his opposition to the French scheme of a Danubian kingdom. Perhaps all parties may eventually be reconciled to an arrangement which at best is only provisional and experimental. If the people of Moldavia and Wallachia, enjoying peace ard administrative freedom, have sufficient vigour, notwithstanding the discordant mixture of Jew and Gipsy elements, to mould themselves into a nation, they caninot fail event.ally to achieve the independence which the more sanguine among them already desire. The wisest and. most patriotic members of their community are well aware that the real danger which they have to dread is not on the side of Turkey. In a choice of foreign nrlers it is better to lean to the Sovereign who possesses the least power of oppression. A large section even of the Moldavian clergy would prefer the tolerant government of Constantinople to the meddling supremacy of the CZAR.
cANADA. CAtNADAt. (BY BLECuICo &D IENfATro0NA TELEoRAPH.) LIVERPOOL, WEDNESDAY. The Montreal Ocean Steamship Company's steamer Indian, Jones commander, has arrived from Quebeo with dates to the 26th ult., 50 cabin, and 115 steerage passengers. The Indian experienced cloudy and thick, foggy weather, strong breezes, hail and rain. On the 26th, off the Pilgrims, passed the ship Ailsa, of Glasgow and China, and on the same day, off Hare Islands, the ship Espindola, of Portgrund, and the bark Montezuma, of Falnouth, all bound up; on the 27th spoke the Abigail, of Poole, from Bristol, out 38 days; on the 29th, with Belle Isle abeam, passed several icebergs; and on the 1st inst. exchaDged signals with the Royal Mail steamship Anglo Saxon, bound west. The Moontreal Evcning Pilot states that a general election was about to take place at Toronto, and that the Opposition anticipated the overthrow of the present Alinistry, and that there was a rumour to the effect that there -was to be an immediate imion of the British and North American provinces, and that delegates from Nova Scotia, New Bruiswick, &c., were hurrying up to Toronto to take the matter into consideration. hilitary desertions had become so prevalent (says the 7 ?cbec Gazettc) that the Commander-inChief had prevailed on the authorities to offer rewards for the arrest of all delinquents, and to warn all persons against employing them. The commencement of the extension of the Grand Trunk Railroad east of St. Thomas is announced. A person at Mal Bay (Gaspe) had advertised the recovery of the mail which was on board the wrecked steamer Clyde from some fishermen, who had found it some miles from the wreck, but finding Do money in it had determined to destroy the contents. Among the letters are bills to the amount of 40,8051. The Quebec timber-market showed no signs of improvement, although there had been several large sales ; vesels had arrived pretty numerously. Freights.-To London, 35s.; to Liverpool, nothing doing, few being inclined to ship at any rate; to the Clyde, 29s. to 30s.
FOREIGN TiNTELLIGENCB. FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN CORRBSO1RNDNT.) PARIS, OcT. 6. Notwithstanding the reports that have circulated of an intended visit of the Emperor Napoleon to Berlin, it is thought that it will not take place this year, and that the meetings of crowned heads are at an end for the present. The respective value of those that have already occurred seems to be daily more accurately appreciated here, and the degree of real sympathy and rapprorhemod indicated by andl springing from that of Stuttgart is not overrated. Those persons may tranquillize their minds who feared or hoped that the interview betwveen the Emperors of Fralnce and Russia might be held to indicate a weakening of thie alliance between Englandand France. No such result is to be apprehended, and I have aood reasons for believing that the French (Government is desirous it should not even be sup posed; also that the Emperor Napoleon never set a higher price on the English alliance than at this moment, nor was less likely to do anything ttiat might impair its tirmness and cordiality. -No oticial intelligence has as yet been received here of the Queen of Spain having accepted the resigruation of NSarvaez and his coleagues. Varivus rumours are current, but nothing authentic is knowni. Among other reports is one that iNarvaez had left Mladrid and arrived at Bayonne. This is doubtless a enard. There could be no such desperate haste for the Duke of Valencia to leave Spain. He is by Ito means the most unpopular member of the Cabiniet, and, moreover,the crisis does not appear to have at all the character of those violent ones which have terminated by the precipitate retreat of the displaced Premier from the capital, and even from the country. All that we can be sure of is that the Ministers resigned on the 1st, and that on the3d theystill persisted inmaintaininig their resignation. It is not certain that the Queen accepted it. and, althou glh a private despatch from a respectable qluarter represented its acceptance as positive, the delay in the official confirmation induces a doubt of the lact. Destatches received to-day at the French Foreignoflice ann,ounce that the King of Sweden has been recommended by his phyEicians to winter in Italy. A repi rt has just been published by Prince 'apoleoni on thb subject of the Great Exhibition of 1855 in Paris. The statistics it contains show to what extent the exhibition attracted visitors to Paris. The regulations of the French police, according to -which all persons sleeping at an hotel or lodginghouse liave their names entered in a book ;ept for the purpos e, greatly facilita ;e such an estimate. In this manner it is ascertained that during the time of the Exhibition, from the 15th of May to the 30th of November, the visitors to houqes of that description, who in the same period of 1854 had been 198,000, attained the number of 330,000, being an increase of 132,000. Of the 330,000, 231,000 were French, and 99,000 foreigners. These figures, however, do not suffice for an appreciation oF the influx, since inaniV visitors founid (quarters in the houses of friends, and many others arrived by railway in the morning and left at night. The railway returns provide for the deficiencyand show an increaseof 753,000 arrivals in I'aris in 1855. According to the record kept bv the management of the Exhibition, the number of visitors amounted to 5,162,000, of vwhich 4,]80,000 were to the Lrpo.,itioA (le l'Jutxnslrir'l 935,000 to that of Fine Arts, and 40,U000 to the Chinese Museum, which was annexed to the latter. On days when tho price of admission was 20 centimes, or 2d., 2,182,000 persons entered; on franc days 2,097,000. From the 16th of May to the 31st of July only 33,000 persons entered on Fridays, which then were 51. days; from the 1st of August to the 9th of November the 5f. were reduced to 2f., and there were o15,000 visitors on Fridays. So that the whole amount received for admissions would be under 2,000,uOWf., or about 115,0001. sterling. The real expenses of the Exhibition are stated at 8,515,000f. The report dwells upon the general utility and various advantages of exhibitions of this kind, and advocates tht ir repetition. But, considering that, in consequence of the great progress of science and manutactures, each new exhibition will require greater space and more extensive constructions, it is suggested that they should not be renewed frequently, but at rather long intervals. The report proposes that they they should continue to be ' universal,"-that is to say, inviting specimens of the industry of all nations, but that in their composition they should be partial-embracing, that is to say, only one class of products. And at long intervals-say, for instance, every half-century, a grand general exhibition might take place. The Consttitutionrnel, commenting on the report, and thinking, not without reason, that to limit such exhibitions to a particular group or class of manufactures would be greatly to dimiinish their attractiveness, proposes, as an amendment, to have general exhibitions of French produce at short intervals, and, at longer ones, universal exhibitions, to which all nations should be invited to contribute. The CSpec&tkeur learns from the Jouin-al diu Ravre that several letters which reached Antwerp by the lastIndianmail hadevidentlybeen opened, andfroma Belgian paper that letters from Bengal,receivedatAntwerp and the I lague, had been delivered unsealed, and with passages obliterated. It is plainly insinuated that the letters in qiuestion had been tampered with in the Indian post-ollices, and the Speetatewr asks if this would not also explain why, after the arrival of the last mail, it found in the papers in general much less Indian correspondence than usual. The charge thus brought against the Anglo-Indian post-office is in the form of nmere looso assertionis, unsupported by any kind of proof, and is, in fact, ridiculous. The Indian Government can have no interest to suppress the accounts sent to Europe of what passes in that country. We have no coinplaints of the sort from England, whither the great mass of the correspondence goes, and where it is chiefly published. And a post-office, if it did open letters, wvould hardly take the trouble to efface passages or deliver them with broken seals, but would be more likely to suppress them altogetber. There can be no doubt that it is completely false that letters have been received in Belgium and Holland in that condition-at least, to such an extent as would justify suspicion of the post-oflice. Many Iettcr-iwriters effacepassages they repent of, andt probably in every mail-bag that arrives from India a few badly-sealed letters may come open. The security of correspondence in all English postoflices, whether at home or in the colonies, is well hinown to the world, and greatly envied by somne of the continental nations. As to fewer letters than usual having appeared in the papers since the arrival of the last nmail, the correspondence from India bitherto contained in the French and Belgian journals has been utterly insignificant in amount, and (as regards Belgium) of very doubtful authenticity, smelling stronply of Brussels counterfeit; and, as regards the English papers, the appetite of the .Hpectobfntr must be indeed insatiable if it has not found nutriment in the mass of letters that they have daily contained. The Z.o ircrs, which assuredly will end its days in a strait-wvaistcoat, is quite frantic at finding that none of the journals, French or foreign, against which it continually launches its venomous, but innpotent shafts, will take the trouble seriouslv to otice its crazy lucubrations. It is exasperated beyond endurance at being continually pooh-poohed, and would give its best cowl for any decent opponent who would condescend gravely to argue with it. Perfectly unscrupulous, and despising the rules of fair fight, to its French contemporaries it is sometimes dangerous. The .Si.lr the other day sumewhat iuguardedly included in a list of persons deceased whom it mentioned with high eulogium. as ornaments of the Liberal party in France the name of Enugne Sue, whose most objectionable work, the lflyst'res dit Peeu,c, has lately been the object of a condemnation pronounced against it as immoral and antireligious by a French tribunal. The [Unirers forth- with, with a most malignant animns, pointed this out to the attention of the Government, evidently eamer and hopeful to get the Siid7 into trouble. WVhen it is not playing some spiteful trick of this kind, or enlightenmg the world as to the virtues of some newly-made but wholly unknown saint, or telling of Cochin-Chinese martyrs about to be canonized, the Unim*rers knows no better recreation than to fall foul (and very foul indeed it is) of England and the English prees. The Indian insurrection has been welcome news and a pleasant topic to this inost Christian and charitable of French journals. There can be no question which way its sympathies ,are; it prefers the idolater to the Prote3tant, the Hindoo to the Englishman. To-day its indignation is rouised by somtle strong expressions of Sir Charles NapLer in his speech at Bury, and it indulges in the I following remarks * The hon. member of the English Parliament forzets the barbarities committed by his countrymen before the insurrection, and the refinements of tortures invented by - General Neil." The latter reference is probably to the loss of caste inflicted on captured Sepoys by making them clean the colirt they had flooded with the blood of their victims. The Univers is not particular about making its meaning clearS when obsetrity may be damaging to those it assails. To read the above passage one might suppose the Sepoy murderers had been burnt alive or broken on the wheel. Thei Ultramontane jouirnal continues thus:- " Sach are the sentiments that divide among them the | EDglish nation; the struggle is lively between those remains of Christianity which heresy has not yet entirely stifled in the heart of the once so chivalrous people, and the Pagat spirit which Protestantism has roused wherever it has triumphed. Which viU carry the day? The newv hunmiliations that await the English in India will doubtless give tine to good sentiments to gain the upper hand. For our part, if the majority of the nation is with Sir Cha,les Napier, we cannot desire the success of the English arms." Fears had been expressed lest the island of La Reunion (Bourbon) should suffer from the Indian insurrection, wlhich it was thought might lead to a failure of the supplies of rice and corn it has been in the habit of drawing from Indian ports. The ,Side states that the following measures have been taken to prevent any such inconvenience:- " M. Eubert-Delisle, governor of the Island of La R.- union, has addressed, under the date of the Gth of August, a proclamation to the mayors of the colony announcing that measures have been taken to throw open the colony to the free entry of rice and corn. Moreover, a premium of 6f. per 100 kilogrammes has been established in favour of rice imported from Madagascar, where that article may at present be purchased at an insignificant price. Finally, the Governor prohibits the exportation of corn and other article3 of food. The Governor invites the landholders-the sugar planters in particular-to grow corn, and especially Indian corn, in fallow land, in the fields prepared for the canes, and in those even where thecrops of sugar have been collected." M. Pichon, French Consul-Genoral at Snayrna, who has been appointed Charg6 d'Affaires at the Court of Persia, and who was to have proceeded forthwith to Teheran, has been authorized to remain in Paris, in accordance with a prayer he had presented to the Emperor to be permitted to rerain in France until next spring, and to leave in company with Feruk Khan, who is expected then to return to his own country. By command of the Emperor the portrait of Marmont, Duke of Ragusa, has been placed among those of the mnilitary celebrities in tho Gallery of Versailles.

The only newl s to be communicated is that the train which left this city for Trieste at S 40 p.m. on the 2d inst. ran against a goods train between Lopfenberg and touck. The passengers suffered no injury, but two stokers were killed and two guards severely wounded. g PRUJSSIA. (FROMc OUR OWN CORsESPONDErt.) BERLIN, OCr. 5. Almost the only thing of recent occurrence here that looks Ilke political history is the visit of Prince Murat to this c ourt. Xe arrived here on the 1st inst.> the bearer of a letter from the Emperor Louis N apoleon to the Kiing, which he presented to His Mlajesty the following day, and remained to dinner with the Royal party at Potsdam. It is difficult to state w oith precision what may be the contents of private letters that pass between monarchs, and therefore I wiL only add that, so far as I can glean anything of its purport, it is amere courteous expression of regret that the King should have been prevented by ill health fronm joinng the re tio7tat Stuttgart. All sorts of conjectures are currentd s to the probable contents of the letter, but I apprehend that the above is the nearest correctness. The Emperor and Empress of Russia, who were prevented from coming on hither froml WNeittar last IFriday by the unexpected indisposition of one of their children, arrived at Potsdam last night, two days too late for the military festival that the Emperor was to have been present at on the Saturday morning. These visits of the present Emnperor of Russia to his uncle are now of too frequent occurrencc to attract much attention from the political workl, and yet they are not without a very salutary influence on European politics, and even in some degree on the home policy of Russia, for here at least the Emperor can expect the truth to be told him, and to hear an unbiassed and candid jadgment expressed on many points that have to be subsequently decided at St. Petersburg. Probably the chief subject-matter of conversation between the two monarichs on this occasion will be the acknowledgments of the younger for the exertions of the elder in paving the way towards his approximation to and reconciliation with other monarhbs, between whom and himself the late war had still left some remains of bitterness, and the necessity for mutual explanation, and doubtless also the late meeting at Stuttgart will furnish an ample source of interest and conversation. In conse(juence of this delay in the Emperor of Russia's visit here, the departure of the Kilig on a visit to the Duke of Augustenbturg at Schloss Primkenau, to be present at a christening, has been put off till to-morrow; and on Thursday he will proceed to Sagan, and after a day's stav with the Duchess of Sagan he will return to Potsdanli. The Prince of Prussia and his son, Prince Frederick WIilliam, axrived at Potsdam on Friday, to be present at the military ceremony of the next day, andI remain here until the departure of the King and the Emperor of Russia. Immediately after the King's birthday, October 15, the young Prince will return to England and keep bis own birthday, the 18th of October, at our Court. The military festival to which I have alluded above was the 50th anniversary of the King's having become an officer of the Ist Regiment of Foot Guards, aud on this occasion the officers past aud present of the regiment presented His MIajesty with a highly decorated album-like book, containing the list of all the officers that had ever been attached to tbe regiment, after which the King inspected the regiment, and in a speech which lie niade to them alluded to his reign having been hitherto a reign of peace, and expressed his confidence that, neverthe- less, his troops, if called on tc defend their country, would manifest the same spirit and devotion that had signalized their fathers. The family of Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, which seems to be the constituted nursery for Queens, as that of the Royal line of Bavaria was in the past generation, is now about to furnish a consort for the Crown Prince of Naples. The bride elect, who is a sister of the present Empress of Austria, has lately left home, accompanied bv her parents, for Ischl, 'where the Jiaeteailles are to be j celebrated. The young KiDg of Portugal has also i sent an envoy in the person of Cotnt Lavradio to Sigmaringen, to solicit, in his name, the hand of the Princess Stephanie, the eldest daughter of Prince Carl Anton, of ELohenzollern. This application to the father of the young ladly wil be followed by a similar requeast to be preferred at this f xt to the King of Prussia, as head of the house of EIohenzollern, for his consent to the match, which being obtained, the nuptials will take place at Dusseldorf in the middle of next month. It is probable that in consequence of this connexion of the two families Prussia will in future be represented at Lisbon by a M1inister- Resident; hitherto she has, out of motives of I economy, and on account of the unimportant relations of the two countries, only maintained a Charg6 d'Affaircs there. The Russian organ in Brussels, Le .Yoid, is, as usual, striving to deceive the world on the subject of RTissian politics, and adopts the iisual trick of representing the late interviews of the Emperor AlexanderwithLouisNapoleon and FrancisJoseph -is the result of endeavours on their part to bring aboaut an approximation. This is, however, true only of the latter, and that in but a small degree. It was the King of Prussia who first enadeavoured to bring about a reconciliation between his two nephews on the occasion of his visit to Vienna in J uly last, and Berlin wvas proposed for the field of their rreimcotre. This attempt did not succeed at the time, nor did another which took Warsaw for its renue ; and it is very possible that subsequent and very recent events led Francis Joseph to give -way, and to stipulate for the meeting to take place on some neuitral German ground. The meeting was not improvised in a hurry by the Russian Emperor because his efforts at Stuttgart had failed, for it was definitively settled at Darmstadt on the 22d ult. that it should take place. The Weimar meeting was therefore no consequence of the results of that at Stuttgart, but rather of the fact that a meeting took place at aU between the Emperors of Russia and France; the result of that Stuttgart meeting, or rather the 'want of result, has doubtless influenced those of the Weimar meeting, and it would be idle now to expect that Count Buol, the valued servant of the Emperor of Austria, should be sacrificed to the personal feelings of the Emperor of Russia, who is a long way off being " master of the situation." Le N'orcd is altogether one of the most valuable members of the continental press; its correspondents keep up a constant supply of novelties for less imaginative purveyors of news Lo examine into, and in almost all cases to refute. For instance, it has been lately informed from here, and consequently all Europe expects it to take place, that the Emperor Louis Napoleon is coming on a visit to this Court. A second version of the same fable stated that the visit would not take place immediately, but at a later period in this year. The mission of Prince Miirat here has probably suiggested the notion of this visit, for there is nothing very out of the way in supposing that an Emperor who proclaims his institution of the empire to be a peaceful one should desire to be on good terms with a King, his neighbour, who has been so unremitting in his endeavours to restore peace, after his efforts to prevent war had proved uinavailing. The Emperor Louis Napoleon has not, however, been as yet invited to corne hither, nor has he invited himself, so that the visit must be looked on at present as not likely to take place this year, as the Nord expects; but I would not by any means wish to imply that it is impossible or improbable on some future occasion. The Emperor ts known to have expressed to the Prince of Prussia, on occasion of the latter's coming to greet him at Baden, a desire to have an opportunity of seeiag Prussian troops, which remark was made apropos of the short period of service in the Prussian army and in connexion with the camp at Chalons, which he had just then left. Voili toid. The Nord has only anticipated history by about a year. The King of Saxony has just arrived here on a visit to this Court. ALGERIA. "The accounts fiom Great Kabylia," says the AMoneitur Algprien,- "Are most satisfactory. Tranquillityand securityoeverwhore prevaiL This fortunate state of things is due not only to the vigour displayed by the French during the last expedition, but more particularly to the determination come to by Marshal Randon to found a mUitary establishmeut In the very centre of the tribe of the Beni-Raten, as the onlyeffectual means of definitively securing to France its new and glorious coDquest. Fort Napoleon has been constructed with prodigious rapidity. It is scarcely three months since the fortifications were laid, and already the greater part of the numerous buildings are finished. The enclosure, which, flanked by 17 bastions, his a d!velopment of 2,000 metres, is now all completed. Tao interior, which covers a surface of 12 hectares (30 acres), is covered with large buildings. The Cvil town is situated along the side of the road. Including the houses of the colonists, there are 67 buildings, 42 of which are finishtd, and 25 in course of construction, and together they forLa a large and imposing town, which, raised as if by enchantment, commands the newly conquered country, and keeps all the surrounding district in subjection." SWITZERLAND. The Grand Council of the canton of Neuchatel, in a recent sitting, was occupied with the question of the electoral basis of the representation. Two propositions were brought forward. One, by Ml. Phlilippin, consisted in asking the people to grant full powers for the Grand Council to enlarge the basis of the national representation. This was adopted with an amendment of M. Lambelet, to the effect that the decree issued by the Grand Council, in virtue of the powers which shall be given by the people, -must be submitted for the approval of the popular committees. The second proposition, presented by M. Piaget, demanded that the people should be called on to give its opinion on the two bases of the representation-the electoral population, or the whole Swiss population. This was rejected by 45 votes to 30. ITALY. The Pontifical Government has published the following decree:- " His oliness, wishing to give a greater extension to the export of hemp from the Pontifical States, has ordered that the existing duty on the export of hemp shall be re duced from 20 to 15 bajocchi the 100 pounds weight.' (The bajocco is worth 4s.) A bulletin published at Florence on the 2d announces that her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, now labouring under an attack of measles, is going on favourably. SPAIN. The Madrid journals of the 2d have arrived, but they seem not to know anything with certainty of the change of Ministry. The Clamor says that " if persons who were aupposed to be well informed" were to be believed, the Ministers had offered their resignation, and it had been accepted, but it expresses little confidence In the statement ; and the other papers not only do not conlirm it, but the Epoca and the Espana, which are semi-official organs, say that the chances were that the Narvaez Cabii,et would remain in power to tle mreetina of the Cortes. The Queen had presided at a Council of Ministers. The Gazette does not contain a decree nominating General de Mirasol to the Captaincy-General of Cuba, though it was said the Queen had consented to the nornination. The ls'spanta intimates that it was not true, as had been reported, that General Lersundi was to pass from the Ministry of Marine to that of War. The Count de Lucena (O'Donnell) had arrived in Madrid, as nad also other eminent political personag-es. The I(ersa says that a project for the unionl of the two branches of the Bourbon family was inder discussion in high quarters. The state of siege of the province of Miurcia, which has existed since the insurrection at Carthagena on the 2d of June last, was, it is said, about to be removed. It was stated some time ago that an Asiatic Prince, called the Rajah of Tiperaxi, had. sent a young Asiatic to Mladrid to present to the Queen a volume of poetry of his own composition; it is niow stated that the Queen had received the volume most graciously. and had expressed the highest opinion of its poetical merits. The name of the Rajah's domiuions is represented to be Tiperal, not Tiperari.
JOLLY JURYME?N.-The hotel bill of the jury impanelled in the recent trial of Gentles and Reid at the ;;tirng Court of Justiciary was within a trifle of 701. This fact may help to dispel the popular belief that jurymen during the progress of a trial are doomed to subsist on sech common-place fare as bread and water. Considering the number of days over which the trial extended, perhaps the score run up at the Golden Lion is not very unreasonablp, which is more than can be said for a jury at Aberdeen, who ran up a bill of 171. between the hours of 7 in the evening and 10 of the morning following, or of a jury at Iuvernes, whose bill for toddy alone for one night was 81-A1loa AJdevdiscr.

ARRIVAL OF THE 2dAILS AND PASSEYV- GEBS FROM INDIA. SOUTHAMPro?T, OcT. 7. The Peninsular and Oriental Companu's steamship Indus Captain R. W. Evans, arrived early this morning from Alexandria with the heavy portion of the India and China mails, in charge of Lieutenant Hay, ILN., Admiralty agent. Sbe left Alexandria on the 23d ult.; Malta, the 27th; and Gibraltar the 2d inst. Throughout the voyage home fine weather was experienced up to the 4th inst., since which head winds and a long heavy sea. This steamer brings a valuable freight, comprising 53,977.!16s. in Australian gold, ex European ; .325,6601. 19s. ditto, ex Columbian; and 5,S161. from Alexandria-total amount of specie, 385,3631. 5s. Also precious stones, emeralds, &c., value 5S,230 rupees, and a cargo compris ng 2,000 bales of silk, 24 packages of elephants' teeth, five cases of tortoiseshell, five bags of gum, two boxes of tokas, and sundry packagas of miscellaneous merchandise. At Alexandria were Her Majesty's ships Caradoc and Desperate, two Austrian corvettes and one cowel, and the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Vectis. Her Majesty's steamer Hibernia, the gunboat Coquette, and the steamer Ariel were at Malta on the 27th ult. The only English ship-of-war at Gibraltar was the Curlew. The Conqueror, Captain Yelverton, left on the evening of the 26th, with a fair wind, to join Aldmiral Lord Lyons's squadron at Malta. The screw-steamship Alps, from Liverpool, put into the bay at 6 o'clock on the morning of the 28th, aud proceeded at 11 a.m. to Malta and Constantinople. The Karnak screw steamship, Captain Brownless, arrived at Gibraltar on the night of the 30th, in six days and a-half from Liverpool, and proceeded on the foUowing day for Genoa and Leghorn. The Indus has brought home 46 first and 32 second.class passengers, 38 children, and 28 invalids andideck passengers -total, 144. Subjoined is a list of those from India, the remainder being from Hongkong, Alexandria, Malta, and Gibraltar. From Calcutta.-Mrs. Elkington and child, Major Englishe's child and nurse; Mrs. Dent, infant, and nativo female servant; Mrs. Colonel Simpson, Mr. Phillips, Mr. Avery, Mr. Butler, Mr. H. Parrott, Mr. J. Lindlay and wife; Mrs. Collett and infant, child, and native female servant; Mr. Chapman, Mrs. Roberts and infant; Mrm Turner, child, and infant; Mrs. Bloomfield, Captain and Mrs. Montague and native man servant; Mrs. Beckett and infant, child, and European female servant; Messrs . PhilUips, W. King, and W. Macy. From Madras.-Mr. Thompson, Major and Mr. Young; Mrs MI'Lean, two infants, and native servant; Mrs. Cholmely, child, and infant; Mrs. Colonel BlaxIand and child, Mr. and Mrs. Biggs; Dr. and m Patterson, three children, and native female servant; Lieutenant De Haver. land, Mrs. Birch and European female servant. From Galle.-Mr. and Mrs Staples and fonr children, Mr. Harper, Miss Hall and native female servant. From Bombay.-Mrs. Morphy, Mrs. Goldie, Mrs. Hamilton, two children, and two European female servants; Mrs. Stewart, infant, and European servant; Rev. and Mrs. Candy, Mrs. Price, two children, and European servant; Capta and Mrs. Wadge and infant, Mrs. Warden and child, Mrs. L'Estrange and two chUdren, Mr. Gray, Mr. Lyle, Mrs. Goldsmith, Mrs. Gill and two children, Mr. )iNeill, Mrs. Minnie and infant, Mrs. Sandiman and child, Messrs. J. Trater, T. Gilly, and G. Bleshen. As soon as it became known that the Indus was in sight people flocked to the docks in great numbers, notwithstan& ing the wet and tempestuous state of the weather; some to welcome the return of relatives and friends, some to minis. ter to the wants of any of the passengers that might chance to be in distress, and others from a mere curiosity to "see the wounded refugees from India." This latter class, how. ever, were doomed to be disappointed, there being only two of the passengers out of the whole number who had received bodily injuries fxom the nmutincers, and these not of a character to catch the eye of the bystanders. Earliest among those who went on board as soon as the Indus was berthed at her whatf was the indefatigable Lady Mayoress, who had again come down from London for the purpose of searching ont any cases of distress that might exist among the passengers, and administeringrelief to them with her ow-uhand. Her Ladyship was accompanied by her two nephews, sons of. the Lord Mayor's brother, who fel among the earliest victims at Meernt. Braving the wind and rain, which came down in torrents at the time, this philanthropiclady proceeded on board the steamer immedi. ately communication with the shore was possible, accompaniedby the Mayor of Southampton (hr. J. White), and the Local Relief Committee, also by Captain Engledue, the Peninsular and Oriental Company's superintendent at this port. After a careful inquiry, however, it was happily foLnd that the proffered assistance was not needed in any one case, and the good Samaritans had to leave the ship without an opportunity by actual deeds of fulfilling their benevolent mission. The two passengers above alluded to as being wounded are Captain Mfontague and Ensign Chapman. The first of these officers has a broken arm, sustained, we understand, while with General Havelock's brave band at Cawnpore ; and the other received a bullet in his cheek, fired by the mutineers, who surprised him and his brother offlcers while at mess in the early stage of the rebellion. Nothing is added by this arrival to our stock of informstion relative to the extent and progress of the rebellion. The next steamer to arrive with Indian passengers is the Ripon, due at this port on the 20th inst.

THE LATE EARL F ITZW1LL1AM.-EarI Fitzwiliam was a man of chivalrouLs honour, the highest moral courage, perfect independence, and a disinterestedness altogethtr beyond that of statesmen er pablic men in generaL There were two or three acts of his life so noble as to entitle him to a monument even more splendid than that of the Marquis of Rockingham in the mausoleum at Wentworth. eWe refer, in the first place, to his conversion from tile views of an opponent of Parliamentary reform, in which he had been educated, to those of a bold and ardent advocate of that measure; which, considering that his family possessed several pocket boroughs, and that he was among that Whig aristocracy -ho so long regarded the government of the country as their prescriptive right, was an act deserving of historical fame. But still more extraordinary was his early advocacy of the repeal of the Corn Laws, when his own fortune depended mainly upon the land, and when the all but universal belief of landowners was that free trade would ruin them. He stood almost alone in his own order, and that for a long course of years; and the position which he held was a proof of an intellectual sagacity nearly equal to his own disinterestedness and moral courage. There was another act of his public life only less singular in its boldness and rectitude than the two we have mentioned. Some 40 years since it waa the unanimous opinion of the manufacturers, merchants, and clothiers in this great seat of the woollen trade, that to aUow of the exportation of English wool would be the absolute destruction of our manufacturin superiority. Earl FitzwiUliam (then Lord Milton), who had been returned for Yorkshire mainly by the exertions of the manufacturing interest, was waited upon by a powerful deputation of his constituents to solicit him to oppose a measure which was then anticipated, rmittino English wool to be exported. His lordship, who had emyxbraced the princples of free trade without qualification, told the deputation somewhat brusquely that he would not walk over the room to prevent such a measure being carried. It will be remembered, too, that Lord Milton fnUy concurred with his noble father, the former Earl Fitzwilliamn, in openly condemning the conduct of the Manchester magistrates at the Peterloo massacre of August, 1819; for which act, or rather for petitioning that the event might bo inquired into, the noble Earl was deprived of the Lord-Lieutenancy of the West Riding. Those whose recollection goes back to the county meetings and county elections held in the Castleyard at York before the year 1830 will remember how I7rd Milton (the Earl just deceased) used to stand in front of the hustings, erect as a dart, Isis fine eye dilating, and a smile of proud honour upon his lips, while his voice rose under emotion to a stentorian compass, and he thundered forth his denunciations of what he deemed nnjust and wrong. He was not eloquent, neither was he a man of very distinguished ability, but so noble was his spirit that on such occasions he became eloquent and produced a Dopular offeot upon his audience which few orators could surpass.-L,fcis .crcury,
I I.YDIA N MOTINIES BELIEF FUND. BIDEFORD. Tbo Mayor of this town, Mr. John Thompson, conveneol a public nmeeting of the inhabitants on Saturday at the Town-haIL The M.lyoR, who presided, snid he was quite sure the history of the world did not affcrd another such example of intense suffering as that endured by our countrymen and countrywomen in )ndia. Various statements had been published sq to the causes of the mutiny, but he contended that it was not their duty to go into them on the present occasion, as all should be forgotten in their sympatby with the sufferers. (Cheers) Inconclusion,hisworshipealledupon the inhabitants to give liberally to the fund established by the Lord Mayor of London, and he said he was quite sare his fellow-townsmen would readily respond to the calL M1r. ROOxER moved, and Mr. G. B. CHANTFR seconded, a resolution to the effect that a subseription libt shoald be opened. Arrangements were then made to canvass the town, and after a v9te of thanks to the Mayor the meeting separated. WE1JLOCK. On Tuesday a highly influential meeting, convoned by the Mayor (Mr. WiUhiam Nicholas), was held in the Gnildhall, for the purpose of aiding the fund now being raised for the relief of the sufferers m India. The Mayor presided. Several resolutions expressive of sympatby with onr unfortunate countrymen in the East and for devising me;sures for their relief were adopted by acclamation. The meeting was addressed by Mr. GASIKLL, X.P. The hon. gentlernan, after touchingly alluding to the horrors and calamities endured by our countrymen and countrywomen in India, said it was not only our duty to support, but even to stimulate, if need be, the Government in the adoption of whatever measures it might be deemed expedient to pursue. He said,-Let us also pay a tribute of grateful and affectionate admiration to that heroic leader and to his devoted followerrs who arO now doing battle for their country against such fearful odds; whose deeds are above Greek and above Roman fame, who, whether it be God's will that they ahould succeed or fail, have covered themselves with imaperishable glory in that magni6cent march from Allahabad to Cawnporo; whose exploits must fiU one of the most glorious pages in the history of this country, whether it be a mournful one or not; and whose endurance, and patriotism, and self-devotion are unsarpassed in the annals of any nation or in the records of any age. A subscription list was opened, and 2404 was subscribed in a few minutes.

PESFFN('E OF MIxr-m.-The Nort'alk (Connecticut) GaecUe says,-" On Saturday lasb a runaway horse rushed up Main-street in that town and ran into theNlew Canaan stage, in which there were two ladies, a Mrs. Raymond, with an infanZt in her arms, and Mrs. Huested, wife of the Rev. Mr. Huested, of the Metbodist Church, with her three children antd another lad. The collision started the stage horses at a furious speed with all its precious freight of frightened women and children. Mrs. Raymond jumped out with her child in her arms, but was struck on her back and head, and was very seriously, if not fatally, injured. The child was urhurt. But mrs. Htuested, though a small, frail woman, had the courage and presence of mind needed in such an emergency. She did not jump, but with great difficulty kept the children from leaping or failing out, and finaUy made them lie down on the botrom of the stage. She then climbed forward, seized the reins, which were tied in front, and succeeded in so far controling the frightened steeds as to avoid collisions or overturns until they reached New-bridge, a distance of a mile and a-half when she brought them to a stand. Her coolnass, probably, alone. saved all inside from severe injury, if not death. Scores of terrified citizens-some of them probably fathers and friends-pursued the stage, but could do nothing to assist its inmates. There probably had not been seen so many blanched cheeks in Norwalk since the terrible railrosd disaster as when tbese horses wvere seen tWaring at sucI" a furious speed with a stage filled with women and little childrenf."
