These valuable commodties wae now for the most part ufnisbhd from abroad -a large portIon ehoulelbe furnishod by homne cultivation. But home cultivation wil never flourlsh unless i ren s the English former will not go through she manufacturing processes necaessry to this induatry. He will not crush the seed Into oU and oil-cake he wil not steep the straw, grasa it, tur it, dry it, Ecatch it dres th dinloe, and scnd it to Leeds and ocher disinut markets for sale. These functions are all foreign to his habits, and must, eberefore be pe-formred in England, it at all, by manufacturing mUlers. Jsven in the ecwe of wheat, the farmer hands over the manufacturing Process-rinding-to the miller. In the case of flax, a manufacturing miler is still more neceesry, the operations being so nuimerous, and requiring so much Dractised skUil. It is the object of the Fbx .dil Company to uDply this need.

Soeeralnobleae,nshowever,and landownerms feeling themselves safe under the neow law, took shares at once, not a3 a speculation, hut from a desire to aid in ;eviving a valuable industry, and paid the deposit. It is a satisfaction to the Directors to be able to inform them. that to thls day (June 13, 157) no check bas been drawn against those deposits, nor Is any debt due. The Directors, being satisfied that circumstances we now more favourable, agamn anDounce the existence of the company, and hope that it wIll receive the support its tumportauoe dsmasucd, par tlcular;y from the landed interest. While not refudng lirge, they would prefer smaller subscriptions, their wish being to see all landowners and considerable farmers supporting the enterprise. The Directors do not iutend to caU up more than one-fourth of the capital til they have satisfied themineeves by actual experienee that their views are oDrrect.

THE INDIAN MUTINY. TO TEE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES. Sir,-Since the appearance of the admirable letter signed 'i. P." in your issue of the 2d inst., another mail from India has arrived, bringing us intelligence of the rapid spread and outbreak of mutiny over a great portion of the North-West provinces of the Bengal!Presidency, as well as in Central India. We also know that wherever the native soldiers of the Bcngal army had not broken out in open revolt they were objects of suspicion and mistrust, and that at several stations their officers had much difficulty in persuading them not to desert their colours. What tidings the next mail may bring of the suppression or further spread of this mutiny is, of course, matter of conjectura. One thing, however, may now be assumed to be very clear-viz., that the immediate danger to the maintenance of our power in India is one of our o'wn creation, and that is the native army ; for it must be borne inl mind that this revolt is not confined to tho troops of the line only, but. has extended to the irregulars also. I think it may also be assumed that there is another cause of danger which, if not removed without further delay, threatens the ruin of our Indian empire as surely, though not as suddenly, as the native army, and that is the anomalous constitutionl and complex system by which India is governed. The two evils, then, that we have to deal with and to remedy are the Indian native army and the constitution and form of our governmnent over the vast territories and numerous hordes of Hindostan, the Punjab, Scinde, and Burmah. The suggestions of "MI. P." arein my opinion alike sound and of a practical nature, and ought to be adopted and acted upon without any loss of time; but there are other most important considerations to be weighed in forming this native army, and I venture to supply what appears to be wanting in the plan proposed. I hold that it is of imperative necessity to reorganize and reconstruct this army almost simultaneously with the suppression and total extinction of the revolt. L Abandon the old custom of forming regiments of Hindoos and Mlahomedans promiscuously, and keep them distinct and wholly separate. 2. Cease to fill the ranks of the Hindoo army with Brahmins and Raj poots, and recruit among the lower castes and various tribes from all parts of India, keeping each regiment, however, of a particular caste and race. 3. Divide the Mahomedan portion of the army into an |equal number of separate regiments of Soonies and of Sheeas. 4. Give to every native regiment 10 European non-commissioned officers, besides its proper complement of commissioned officers, and no longer permit cadets to be drilled by natives. 5. The Hindoo and Mahomedan regiments should always be kept apart, and never located at the same stations, nor within a short distance of one another. In offering these additional suggestions I am somewhal influenced by the conviction that the present revolt chiefly the work of Mahomedans, who have cleverly and dexterously availed themselves of the state of chronic revolt under which the Bengal army has long been labouring, and have successfuUy aroused the sensitive Hindoo to a belief that his religion was endangered. I will not stop to argue in detail my reasons for arriving at this conclusion, but will content myself with observing that I am supported in this view by the letter of an Agra correspondent, dated the 3d of June, which appeared in your paper of the 13th inst., and also by the Bnglishman, the leading daily paper in Caloutta. The rendezvous, be it remembered, is the Mabomedan city of Dclhi, the King proclaianed as the restored Sovereign of India is the Mogul, and the command of the revolted troops is usurped by a Mahomedan. No thinking or observant person who has any knowledge whatever of the Hindoo and Mahomedan can for a momaent believe that it is the Elindoo who has urged on or influenced the Mussulman ; yet we find the two coalescing and aoting well together in their revolt against the English an. thority, with results, however momentary, yet all in favour of the Llahomedan. Many are of opinion that it is inopportune to discuss at present the question of a radical and complete change in the government of our mighty Indian empire, but I believe that if it be not now disceassed and settled it will be a hopeless task to attempt to arouse the attention of the public to the subject at any other time of peace and quiet. The con sideration of this question cannot in any way embarrass our authorities in sending out to India all the material assistance required completely to crush this mighty revolt, so long foreseen by all but officials and those in high authority. Thus the home Government having no official intimation of the danger which threatened the very existence of our power in the East, and there having been no direct evidence of whatwas notorious throughout India-viz., the mutinous tendency of its native army-Lord Dalhousie was sapported and Sir C. Napier sacrificed, the result being the fearful tragedy now enacting in Asia. The remedy for this evil condition is a radical change in our system of governing India. I am, Sir. Tours obedientlv. AKEBAR. Bayswater, July 24. NOVEL ROBBSERy.-Mr. Jefferson, farmer, Cadeby nearDoncaster, having sold a considerable quantity of wool at the market at that town lst Saturday, proceeded a few days afterwards to the place where his fleeces were storeda cnamber over an outbuilding next to his house-when he discovered that out of 15] fleeces, 78had been surreptitiously removed, by forming a kind of roof of the top fleeces which were supported on hedgestakes, and drawing away the lower fleeces from underneath. Mr. Jefferson and his men had been several times in the place during the last week, but it was not until the wool was shifted, preparatory to its being delivered t a buyer, that Mr. Jefferson discovered he was minus Just half of hits fleeces.
BLBCTZONif COMMMM&IEE& GIOCElSTER ICovi The committee APPOinted to nzqurdr Into the petitions against the return for the city of Glocester mnet for the first tuone yesterday. The members are Mr. S. E. D)e Vere M1r. EB. B. Farubam," Mr. George Bidley, Mr. George Solater; chayrman, Lord Robert Grosvenor. Ter are two petitions against this return, one Inst Sir R. W. Cardea and the other against Mr. W. Philip Price. The petition against M1r. Price, which is signed by electors of the city san contains allegations of bribery and corruption, was first taken. Counsel for the petitioners Mr. Slade, MIr. Clark, and Mr. Cook; for the sitting member Mr. Price, Mr. Edwin James, Mr. Phinn, and M1r. Neale. .Mr. SLADE, n openig the case against the return of Aft. Price, said that eletions in this city wore Benerallyvery closely contested, but at the last election ir R Carden was returnea by -a miuch larger majority than usual. Sir R. Cardlen haA been invited to become a candidate when it beame known that a disolution must take place, because many of the electors thouRht it was proper that a commercial city like Glocester ouzht to be represented by a commercial, man. On the 13th of March Sir R. Carden arived in the city, when he comn menced his canvass on Conservative principles, and was emhinently succces,ful. The election took place on the 28thx of March and the numbers polled by the respective caudidateA were, Carden, 743; Price 717; Berkeley, 710. This result was in a great measure owing to the manner in which the rxegister had been purged by the Conservative party. It was material that the committee should notice that I the number of plumpers for each candidate wMs -Carden, 612 ; Price, 17; Berkeley, 12. Mr. Price and the unsuccessful candidate, Admiral Sir iAL Berkeley (who were' both Liberals), conduoted the business of the election at the same rooms, and coalesced in every respect; but, for some reason or another, they appointed diferent agents for election expenses. Admiral BPrkeley's agent was Mr. Robert Wilton, while the agent of Mr. Price was Mr. Viner Ellis, a gentleman whose name would be frequently mentioned in the course of this inquiry. Mr. Price and Admiral Berkeley alao issued separate addresses, but their voting cards, placards, flags, ind all ipatters of that kind, were m common, anid the accounts for the election expenses -were made out' iointly". At the eomffencement of the polling the object of the Liberal party was to secure the return of both Mr. Price and Admiral Berkeley; but at a later period, when the return of Sir R. Carden became certain, the friends of the respective Liberal candidates made every effort to obtain plumpers, without regard to the other candidate. It would be proved that various acts of bribery had been committed in order. to obtain these plumpers. From half-past 10 In the morning to 3 in the afternoon Admiral Berkeley was ahead of 3Mr. Price, but Mr. Price then obtained the advan'tage, and was at last returned by a majority of 7 over the Admiral. Conclusive evidence would be laid before the committee to show that that majority had been obtained by bribery, and he would mention one or two cases as examples of the madner in which that bribery bad been practised. A voter named Drinkwater came from Worcester the day before the election, and on the polling day, as there was some doubt as to how he would vote, he was. taken to a publichouse, where a man named Collingburn, in the presence of a Mx. Herbert, called him aside and gave him d1 to vote for Mr. Price, which hedid. Therecouldbenodoubt as totheagency of Herbert, because there was an item in theaccount of lOguineas being paid to him by Mlr. Price for professional services. A voter named Mill had at all previous elections voted blue, and had promised his support to Sir R. Carden. This MMil was a tenant of one Cooksoy, at a rent of 141. a-year, payable monthly, and beforo the election Coohlsey canvassed him for the Liberals, but he refused to promise them his vote. On the:rolingeday hw was again canvassed by Cooksey and his clers, accompanied by Mr. Price. In the course of the day the clerk returned and, not seeing M ill offered his wife 31., which she refused. At 3 o'clock Cooksey lgain came, and offered Mill 5L, which he accepted, and plumped for Mr. Price. No money, however, passed, but when the arrears of rent amounted to 51. there was a set off. A fishmaonger named George Ballock was asked for his vote by Mr. Viner Ellis. Bullock said he had had bad luck lately with his fish, and Mr. Ellis, who was the owner of large fisheries, said that if he voted for Price he should net want for fish. Bullock said he had promised to vote for S;r H. Carden, but Mr. Ellis told him to go and vote for Price, and to call upon him the next morning. Mr. Ellis, as e had mentiona, was the recognized agent of Mr. Price. Besides these cases of bribery he should submit that there had been a colourable employment of messengers, as a large sum was charged in the aceount for messengers, although not a single messenger's name was mentioned. The learned eounsel tuen proceeded to call evidence in support of his case. After the usual formal proof had been given of the return, Mr. Carter, the election auditor, was examined. He produced the accounts and the appointments of the agents for the election expenses of the rs,pective candidates. Thoma Drinkwater, a pipelayer, said he was a freeman of Glocester. Previous to the election he was at Worcester, and he went to Glocester on the evening of the nomina^ tion day; When he arrived he met two of Mr. Price's workmen in the streets. He went with them first to a pubHhcouse, and then to Mr. Price's committee-room, where one of thle men asked a clerk for money for his (witness's) travellng expenses. The elork sadd every one was out but hiself, and he could do nothing. They then went to the Queen's Head,-where they remained till 1 o'clock in the morning, when he proceeded to his father's house and slept there. The'next morning he went to's publichouso with a man called Watkin, and there -metLCollingbarn, - timber merchant, Collingburn gave him a shilling, and asked him if he had voted, He said he had not. Coilingburnm afterwards gave him 5s., and took him into aback yard and said he hoped he would not deceive them A personnamedBiggs then came up and said, " rIll give you a sovereign if you'll come." Witness said, "Stop sbit, and rll come." Biggs said, " Come to the Old Spa (a publichouse), and I'll maxe it all right." They went to the Spa, where they saw Mr. Herbert, the solicitor, and MIr. Wilton. Biggs there offered him a sovereign. He said he wanted 30s., as that would not do more than pay his travelling expenses. At last Biggs slipped the sovereign into his hand, and withCollingburn took him into a fly. He contrived, however, to give them the slip, and went to tho Victoria publichouse. Co gburn and Biggs followed him there, and said they hoped he did not intend to give them the lp after taking the money. Witness said he did not intend to go till he was ready. Collingburn esd he should have two more sovereigns if he would vote. Witness said he wanted three. Collingburn said he could not give him that, on which witness said then he could not vote. Collingburn then took him behind a settle in the room where they were talking, and gave him two more sovereigns, telling him not to let any one know anything about it. He then went to his father, -who was in the kitchen, and showed him the three sovereigns, saying, " Hero, old fellow, who don't you do business like me " After that he went to the poll and voted for Sir R. Carden. Collingburn was present and shook his head at him, and he shook his fist at Collingburn. Cross-examined.-He got nothing by voting for Sir R. Carden. His father always voted blue, and so did he. His real travellng oxpenses were 21s. 6d. and he asked 30s. for them in Mr. Hort's presence. lr. Eerbert said he should only have 11. He did not see Air. Herbert again. He had been in prison for stealing potatoes, but be was wrongfully accused. He had lso been in prison for selling bottles which some one had stolen, and he once had two months for beating a policeman. James Drinkwater, the brother of the last witness, was also caled and corroborated his evidence in many points. He said, however, that his brother only received half-a. crown behind thesettle at the Victoria publlchouse On cross-examination, he said that his brother told him yesterday that he had received two sovereigns, but he did not know whether to believe him or not. James Drinkwater, the father of the last two witnesses, said he had always voted blue. When Thomas went to the publichouse on the polling day he only had a halfpenny in his pocket. le had heard Collingburn offer his brother William 5s. or 10s. to vote for Berkeley and Price, and he had cautioned him not to accept it. He heard Collingburni offered his son a sovereien, which -was refused. Collingburn then called his son to the back of the settle and gave him some money. His son came back to him and showed him three sovereigns, saying, "Old man, why don'tsou go and be served the same9" You can if you like. You are a fool for not taking the money." His son then went and voted for Caxden. Cross-examined.-Collingurn shook his fist in his son's face when he voted, and called hirn a d-d rogue. Richard Watkin, who had come with one of the Drinkwaters from Birmingham, had also seen the three sovereigns given to Thomas Drinkwater by CollUingburn inThomas Drinkwater's hand. Thomas Mill, a greengrocer, was then caled. He said he bad plumped for xr. Price. He had promised his vote to Sir IL Carden. He rented a house of Cooksey at 141. a-year, payable monthly. Cooksey canvassed him for Price and Berkeley, but he said he had promised his vote to Sir R. Carden. His wife had told him that on the polling-day Cooksey's clerk called and offered her three guineas to vote for Price and Berkelev. He told his wife he should not receive any money, and went upstairs, directing his wife to say that he was out. Cooksey followed him upstairs, and promised him .1. if he would vote for Berkeley and Price. Ho said, " Well, 51. will be very useful to me. Will you give it me 9" Cooksey said, " It will be all right, if you poll for Price."' Witness agzeed to do so, got a voting-card, and wrent to -the poll with Cooksey's cierk, and voted for Price. Heedidnot'pay anyraoney to Cooksey wben hetook his rent-book after the election. Cooksey told him it was all right and to keep it dark. He had, however, paid them rent 5l. odd since he had made this statement to the other side, but he still owed some rent. He had never voted against the blues before. Cross-examined.-e had made the statement at Mr. Heath's. He had some whisky while he was making it. He had had some beer before, but he was not stupid at the time. He had never received anything from Cooksey. N=othng had now been allowed off his rent. James Jenkins, a horsedealer and voter, said he usually voted for tbe blues, but at the lmt election he votedforPrice and Berkeley, At the time of the election there was a County Court judgment out against him for 51. odd. He asked Mr. Lovegrove, Sir R. Carden's agent, and other blues to cash a bill for him, but they refused. On the afternoon of the polling day the son of Admiral Berkeley and some other gentlemen came to his house and canvassed him for Berkeley aud Price. He said he was afraid of being arrested under the judgment. They promised to protect him. They led him to believe that if he voted as they wished the debt sbould be settled. Mr. A. Jonet, the solicitor, told him that if be was taken it should bemnone the worse for him. He then voted. He afterwards sent his wife to Mr. Jones to ask for the loan of a few pounds. Mr. Jones refused to lend the money, but sent him half a sovereign. Cross.examnined.-He had bought horses for Mfr. Price, and had known him for several ynears. Winifred Jenkins, the wife of the last witness, gave similar evidence. George Bullock, a fiabdealer, said he bad called at the office of Mr. Viner Ellis, the agent of Mr. Price, during the election. Mr. Ellis asked him for his vote, but he said he 1 had promised it to Sir R. Cardeu, HI aogid that he had had bad luck with hls fish, and had noneto go on with. Mr. Ellis uid he was oonnected with fisheries, anQ if he (witness) vtedfor Mr. Paioe hoe hould never want for fish. He did not see Mr. Bllis again, and, he voted for Sir R. Carden. CharlesTooms, alabourrmand a freeman, said he had plumped for Sir R. Carden. He had been asked by Mr. Wither to vote for Mr. Price. He said ho rUUst first know wbat the figure was, and menUtioned tbe tum of 21. Wither told him to put his name on a card. He did so, and Wither took the card away. He afterwrards saw Wither, but got no mone-y from binu. He plumped for Sir'R. Carden. Be had frequently seen Wither and CoUlingburu in and out of Mr. 1'iee's committes-room. On cro&s-exainatlon he said he had been in prison twice about a little beer. RD-exmined.-Ie had been offered IO0. to prove a case of bribery against Sir R. Carden. The committee adjourned until 11 o'clock this morning. IPSWICHL At the sitting of the committee yesterday morning, James Dennant, jim., the son of the person at whoso house the witness Abbot had been stayig previous to the election, was called, and said he was engaged as doorkeeper -at AdairandMlarshman'scommijtee room. The witness gave the same account as Abbot had given on tho previous day of the circumstances tmder which Abbot had been taken to the poll to vote for Adair and Marahman. Be also stated that between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon young MuUey brought a bagof money to the committee-room. After that voters were brought to the committee-room in cabs, and having remained there a short time were taken away in cabs. He saw Mr. Adair at the committee-room after the money bad been taken there. On the evening of the poll. ing day John Smith gave his fatherhalf-a-crown for Abbot. During the election Abbot lived oni the best of everything at his father's house, and they received the money for keeping him at the committee-room when the election was over. Cards were given them, and they-were paid by Head in the presence of John Smith, and then they gave up the cards. On cross-examination be said that Abbot bad been staying at his father's house bick*sastd and' forwards for years, as long as he could recolect. Heedid not think Abbot was exactly right in his mind, but he was sensible enough to know when he was well treated. On tho polling-day his employment was to keep people out of the committee-room who had no busess there. He saw fr. Adair threo times on that day. A great many cabs called there. Several voters went there between 3 and 4 o'clock. The bsg of money brought by young Mulley was abont as high as a pint pot, and contained silver and gold. He was able to see that there were half-crowns and shilings in it. Abbot said to his father before he got into the cab, "I want it before I vote," and his father said, "It is all right." He had made bis statement a fortnight ago to Mr. Westhorpe, the so]i. citor. He had gone to Mr. Bristow's office, bLt he did not get anything from him. Mr. Westhorpe, a solicitor at Ipswich, said he bad been employed by Mr. Bristow to arrange the evidence in support of the petition. Abbot seemed to -inderstand the statement he had made when it was read ovet to him. He had given no money either to James Dennant or to any other witness to induce them to give evidence. * Cross-examired.-He had exmined upwards of 30 persons, and he bad not paid money to any one in reference to these examinations. Samuel Drake, a non-voter, who had been employed as a doorkeeper, corroborated the evidence of James Uennant wth regard to wbat bad occurred at the committee-room of Mr. Adair on the polling-day. Things went on much more briskly after half-past 2 than in the early part of the Cross-examined.----When witness and the others were paid they went intothe room one ata time. J. Smith was not presenit. A non-voter, named Sawyer, who had also been employed as a doorkeeper by Mr. Lawrance, said he saw Mr. Adair at the committee-room during the greater part of the polling. day. Mr. Marshman was there also. He observed Mr. Long take a man named HInghes into a room, and, after remaining a short time, Hughes came out and said it would not answer his purpose, and went away. He again came back, and went away. When he went away the last time some one asked whether it was all right. Mr. Long said it was. The poUing went on more briskly after Munlley brought the bag. Cross-examined.-When Hughes went away the first time he said it would not answer his_purpose, as it would not pay his traveling expenses. Witness was in the employment of Mr. Bristow, but he had not taken a part in getting up evidence in support of this petition. John Heckford, who had been employed at the Waggon and Horses committee-room on the day of election, stated that he had seen Bedford, Mills, and other persons there. About 3 o'clock he saw a man named Cooke taken into the kitchen, where he remained with a messenger until the close of the poll. - On cross-examination he said that Cooke was in London, and denied that he had received money from Mr. Bristow. Jeremiah Osborne said that on the afternoon of the olling-day he was at the Waggon and Horses, and sawa deaf old man named Cooke go into the yard with Smith and Bedford. He heard Bedford say, " You may hold on, ru goandget it foryou." Cooke said, "rni have it now." Bedford then told the messenger, Corder, to take the old manindoors. Corder took hold of Cooka's arm, (and they went together into the taproom and had some ale. Cooke seemedaansious to get away, and askedfor Bedford. Corder told him to make himself comfortable. Cooke also said it must be nearly 4d'clock, and Corder told him to be quiet. Smith and Bedford came in after 4 o'clock and told Corder to let the old man go. Cooke weat away swearing when he found it was past 4. John Cooke said he was a voter of Ipswich, and he was going to vote at thie last electioni, buSSaith, the tailor, sent some fellows to him on the day of the polling, who kept showing him about and givng him beer until it was past 4 o'clock. Smith had promised to bring him 25s., and the others promised him more money, but he had neverreceived anyof it. Hte and his father before him had always voted Cross-eramined.-He tried to get out, but could not. He was sober at the time. John Wincombe, a labourer atlpswich, said that on the day of the election e went with Stephen Cooke end Green, two voters, to the "yellow' committee-room, where they saw John Smith. Green and Stephen Cooke said they wanted to vote, and a plumber, named Cook, put them into a cab. Witness got outside the cab. He saw Cook, the plumber, give money to Green and to Stephen Cooke. The cab took them to the polling place, and they voted for Adair and Mnrshman. Ho then went with them to the Safe Harbour publichouse, and they hed some beer and biscuits. Both Green and Cooke prodr.ced half-a-crown. They aftenrards went to the Bell, where they had more beer. Cross-examined.-He had not seen Green and Cooke in London. He saw money pass while he was outside the cab. Joseph Webb proved having driven the cab mentiorLed by the last witness to the poll. Wiliam Bowman, a freeman, said he had voted for Adair and Marshman. He and another voter named King had promised to vote together, and on the aftesioon of the poling day theymet Mr. Freke. King told Mr. Freke that he would have a 5l-note if he voted. After a pause Mr. Freke said, "I will give 31." Witness then -aid to King, "I shall not vote-come on." Mr. Freke said, "What a hurry you are in. Go and vote and I will give it you." King said, "I shall not vote without the money." Mr. Fraeke said, "I cannot give it you in the public streets." They then went into the passage at ths Friar's Head, and Mr. Freke gave him two-and-a-half sovereigns. Eing also went into the passage with Air. Freke, and when he camne out they went and voted together. JamesCooper, asergeantof militia,whohad been employed asdoorkeeperat theprivate entrance toAdairandMarshmanls committee-room, said be had seen Mr. Mulley, Mr. Long, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Bedford and other persons go in there. On the afternoon of the polling-day a bag of money was brought to the committee-room by young Mr. Mulley. About 12 o'clock on that day ho saw Garnan, the milkman, who aslked him whether there was any money stirring. He said he thought there was not. Garnan asked him to let bum know when there was. He came again albout 3 o'clock. Witness then said he thought there was some money stirring, as things were very bris. While they were talkingl r.Bedford aeme up, and asked Garnan whether he had voted. Garnan said he had not. Bedford then took hold of Garnan's arm and went away with him.. Cross-examincd.-He was employed by Mr. Bristow as a bottle-washer. In 1841 he was imprisoned for 12 maonths on a charge of felony. Henry Barges, a non-voter, who had been employed as doorkeper at the Chaise Inn committee-room, proved that he had seen Muhey and other persons there. On the day of the election a man namned Watt had an interview upstairs with Muley. When they came down Watt was putting money into his pocket. He then went away to vote. A freeman named Lawrance and several other voters called on that day and saw Mulley. At the conclusion of the witness's examination the committee adjourned until this day. YARMOUTH. This committee held its first sitting yesterday. The memhers were Mr. H. Morgan Clifford, Mr. C. G. Da Pre, Mr. W. J. Garnett, Colonel the Hon. H. P. Maxwell; chairman the Earl of March. The petition, which was signed by certain electors of the borough, alleged that the return of Mr. W. Torrens Mi'Cnllngh and of Mr. E. W. Watkln had been procured by bribery and corruption, and prayed that it should be declared null and void. Counsel for the petitioners :-Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Johnstone, and Mir. Clark; for the sitting members,-Mr. I. James, Mr. Slade, Mr. Rodwell, Mr. Power, and Mr. O'Brien. Mr. O'ALLEY opened the case as one of bribery, money baving been given and promised in order to procure votesfor the sitting members. (e said that the candidates at the last election were Mr. Torrens 3'Cullagh, Mr. Edward Willian Watkin, Sir E. H. Lacon (who had been returned at the previous election at the head of the poll), and Colonel the Hon. C. S. Vereker. The result of the polling was M'Cu31agh, 609; Watkin, 590; LBcon, 521; Vereker, 476. The constituency, which contained about 1,300 voters, consisted partly of old voters, and partly of the new 101. householders, The learned counsel then gave a brief history of the borough, and reminded the committee that in 1848 a Bill had been introduced in consequence of the report of a commission disfrancihsin a number of the freemen. At the last election both parties paid the travelling expenses of voters, but whereas the unsuccessful candidates had returned their accomunts of the money spent by them in the payment of those expenseso the election auditor the accotmts rendered 09 bhalf of the sitting members contained no item of t'hote expenses. The oply object of concealing the amounts so paid must have been the high rates of payment. For some time previous to the election the Liberal party was very active in rnaking preparations. They hired committeerooms in each ward and appointed committees, and a gentle. |man named Royal, who had great inflnenc, and was noted ! fr is ovrsof speech, wras very vreminent in carrying specific cases, the leaar~ned counsel Wctonute bynayng tany proof wiould he given to the committee that a regular organized system of bribery had been carried on by old and experienced hands, and, although he should not attempt §0 implicate the sitting mepiberr personally, they would be con. niected with the persohis who had committed various asctef bribery in suxc a manner that the conlimittee would have no doubt that they muBt be responsible for the acts of those persons as their agents. The usual evidence aa to the writ and the rettrn having been 'given) Mr. Edward Reynolds, the election auditor, produced the accounts of the election expenses. The agent of the sitting ,members was Mr. J. Clowes. The accounts of the sitting I members contained no Item for travelling expenses. One of the unsuccessful candidates, Sir Edward Lacon, w a banker and brewer, and a member of the corporation, and poesessed great local influence. In 1852 he was returned by a large majority over Mr. IrCllagh. Be had seen Mr. l'Cullagh and Mr. Watkin canvaseing accompanied by Mr. i3vin ston e, by M.r D. A. Fowler, MrMialeer, Mr. Stewart, and Ur. Ealeton. Royal was a jorneyman tilor, and & small householder, but was not on the register. Cross-txamined.-He was app6inted by his brother, the mayor'who had taken an active part in all elections Erevious to the last. He voted for Sir Edward lacon. He ad seen 10 or a dozen persons canvassing with the sitting members. Re-examined.-The expdines of the sitting members were 450;. * of the unsuccessful candidates 57S8. Thoinas Haines, a shoemiker, residing at Norwich, and a voter of Yarmouth, said he had taken an active part in the last election on the Blue (Liberal) slde. In the early part ot 1856 1e received a letter (pFoduced) from Mir. mCullagh. It was narl-ed "piivate."' Ir. POwER objected to thisletter being read. fr. O'MALUtEy insisted that it might be read as evidence with regard to the general conduct of the election AMte a shbort discussion the committee-room was cleared, and tho- committee, after deliberation, decided that the letter should be read. The letter, which, was aigned by Mr. M'Cuhlagb, informed: the witness that a ward lit hd been sent t6 Kr. Mebh&m to band to him in order that he might make inquiries respecting the new voters. The letter also stated that the were very busy on the other side, and that if he and t threo friends like him did not counteract their efforts in time they would have cause to regret it. Similar books, it was saidkhad been sent to the other Wards The witness stated that in consequence of that letter he .looked np tlienew voters, and found out who and what they were. The witness was then examined in order to prove the agency of three persons named Waldon, David Garret, and Llainbrice. after which MIr. O'WAi.y applied to the committee to be allowed to amend the list wlbch he had handed in of the names of persons alleged to have offered and received bribes, with the view of adding some fresh names, but Mr. PowER objected, submitting that this was evidently a fishing case, and that, although a general list had been banded iri, yet it was clear that the other narty had no information as to particular cases. He said that they ought not now to be taken by surprise. The Comarr decided that the list could not be now amended. The witness then spoke to a conversation which took place at the committee-room between himself and a person mramed Robimn, who, it was aleged, was an agent of the sitting members, about doubtfnl voters. Robins-, he said, told hbi that he was to look to him (Robins) for his expenses in going down to Yarmouth, and he would see him pai. He went to the poll in a fly ordered by Robins, and voted for M'Cullagh and Watlri. After he had voted he went back to the committee-room and remained there till the poll closed. He saw Mr. Watkin there who thanked bim for his vote. After the close of the poll he went to the Star Hotel, having heard that the members would address the peole tbere. Ho went to the Nelson room, which was full Livingstone and Spilling were there, bat not Royal. Coming out of the -room he met Royal on the landing. Some time after the close of the poll he sent his brother-in-law, Mares, to Robins. In consequence of what ho heard he afterwards sent his wife twice to Robins, and the second time she brought him back 30s. He paid 5s. for railway fare,or himself and his wife from Norwich to Yarmouth. He lunched at the committee-zoom. He saw Royal at the Star, and he then gave him half-a-crown and some brandy. Cross-examined by M1r. RODVELL.-is wife brought back the money to him at 10 o'clock. He was not on; of work He received two letters from Mr. Robins, which he destroyed, but he did not dest-roy Mr. hlrCullagh's letter, because he had too much respect for him. (Laughter.) He had not received any money since the election. He did not know whopald his expenses to London. He was spoken to by Mr. Cooper about the election. Mr. Cooper told himn that perhaps he should want him to go to London. He understood from Mr. Cooper that his expenses would bo paid, but not a word was said about money being given him for anything else. On being strongly pressed the witness said that last Monday he had receive a sovereiRn from the Mayor's officer at Yarmouth. He came u with Mr. Cooper, Mr. Gooch, and others. fr. Ellice, the Mayor's officer, told him when he gave him the Ut. that he might do what he liked with it, and he spent it accordingly. (Iaughter.) He bad made two statements, which were taken down in writing, one at Yarmouth and the other to Mr. Corrie in London. Mr. Cooper took down his first statement. He had been a Aiberal all his life, but considered that he had been il-treated by the party. He would not swear that he did not tell different p,eople that *he party had ill-treated him. He admitted that he told Mr. Cooper so when lie came to ask him about the election, but he did not say that he would tell him all about the election. They had a conversation about the election. It was then that Mr. CoOper told him that hisexepenses would be paid. le expected that he was to he paid for his travellig expenses and his time. He expected. to et a littM more than he could earn at home, which wan haif-a-cronwui a His wife wa there andsaid leshould notgo unlesshlew*as paid for it, but she did not say that he must be well paid for it. Upon being further pressed the witness admitted that Mr. Cooper said that if he would tell him all about tho election and come to London and give evidence he should have something like a guinea a-day. Just before Cooper went away the subject was mentioned again, and he was certainly under the impression that he was to receive 14 Is. a-day. The subject of expenses was mentioned three or four times. He did not know how he should have got ap unless some one had paid his exuenses. He had spent the sovereign, of course. (Laughtet.) He m'uerstood he might do so. Yesterday he went to the sta. tion at Norwich and saw Mr. Cooper, who brouaht him a railway ticket, but nothing was said about money. Yesterday morning he wanted a piece of paper to cut, and went for it to a cupboard, where he found the letter of Mr. M'Cullagh, which he put into his pocket. He would swear that he did not expect, nor did he tell his wife that he expected to get anything for it. Re-examined.-Mr. Cooper asked him, wben he first came to his hose, who paid his expenses of going down to Yarmouth t the election. Nothingwas said about his expenses in coming to give evidence until after he had told h about the election. He expected the guinea a-day for himself. Mr. Cooper said that if witness was required to come he should have that amount. Mrs. Haines, the wife of the last vritness, deposed that she accompanied ber husband on the occasion of the last election to Great Yarmouth, and after the election was over she went to Mr. Robins for their expenses, and demanded 21. He sail that he -ould not make the expenses out so much, not bore than 14 Is., but he gave 9s. more out of his own pocket because she wan dissatisfied. Cross-examined.-She reckoned the expenses altogether at 21. Re-examined.-She was unable to say in what manner the expenses had been incurred. By the CIL&RsA.-Her husband was partly paralysed, and could not have gone to Yarmoutth by himself. In conseq(uence of letters received from Mr. Robins her husband had lost a good deal of time, for which she thought he ought to be remunerated. When in Yarmouth she stopped at her sister's, who, of course, was put to inconvenience, although she would not have taken any money of her. She considered that, aotwithstanding she might not have paid anything, she was entitled to charge as if she had. This evidence closed the case of Haines. George Watson, examined by BIr. O'MALLLE, said that he was a game dealer, and rented the shooting over a portion of some of Sir E. Lacon's estates at Calstor, and aLso some rabbit warrens. He had Always voted Red (Conservative), and on the last occasion had promised his vote to Sir Edmund. On the Thursday before the election be met Spilling, who asked him to vote fJr the Blues (M'Cullagh and Watkin), and, on his telling him he had promised Sir Edmund, offered him first 54. and afterwards 104 for his vote, and told him he was a fool that he did not take the money. He was faull of his chaff afterwards when he met him in the market-place. In cross-examination the vitness said that he believed Spilling would have given the money to him if he had chosenL to take it. Afterwards in the market place he chafed him, and told him he was a fool not to have taken tho monmey. A voter named Benstead was then called, and deposod that he bad received 31. from Royal forvoting for M'Cu3agh sad Watkin. John Drury said he knew a person named Woods, who had told him that if he knew anyone who had the -- tin to play with, and would introduce him, he was the man, and that he would give witness a commission for the introduction. He accordingly introduced Woods to Royal. Woods received 61. from Royal for his vote, and gave witIness 15s. commiission. Coseaie.H a omryafemn u a been struck off the list. Re had reeve 21. head money. The committee adjourned until 11 o'clock this d,y.

Lord RAVENSWORTH presented a petition from the ,offioers and seamen sailing from the river Tno p-rts, prayIng forthe establishment of a harbour o£ retuge en tho mnoth-ea coast. PRIVATE BILLS. The following Bills were read a third time and passed:)uke'f Bridgwater's Estate, Dexthorpe Turnpike Trust, London (City) Coal Duties, Europeau and Indian Junction Telegraph Company, West of Fife Minere B4ilway, Clyde Wavigation, Plteney Town Harbour, 'le kstrbour, Newquay Pier and Harbour and Ra4lway, Reading Railways unction Railwy, Slaney River Improvement, Stockport, lhisley, and Whaleybridge Raliwoy, Worlesop and Atteorliffe- road, Westminster Terminus 'ilway lExtension (Claphaml to Norwxod Abandonmen t), Burial of the 19ead within the City wad Liberties oE london, Otley and Seipten Road, flaslingden and Todmorden Toads, tFife and Kiinross Railway, and Elinross-shire Railway Bills. PUBLIC BUSINESS. The Earl of DERBY wished to put a question to his noble friend the chairman of committees with regard to the resolution moved by ium last year, which was adopted, fixing a particular day after which the House would not proceed to the consideration of any public BilL He could quito understand his noble friend's motives in refraining Irom bringing forward the some motion this year, in conse. quenoeed the lte period at wbich the present session com. menced; but he thought 'they had now reached a period of the session whon it would bo very agreeable to noble lords to Imow really how much more work they had to do. (Hear, hear.) This was the 24th of 3iuly, and he did not think it unres4onable, therefore, to ask his noble friend if he was disposed now to move such a resolution, which would, ho hoped, in that case be supported by Her Majesty's Go. veronment. (A laugh.) Lord REDESDALE observed that in a session which comr znenced in May it would be indisare,t at any early perio; to fix any day after which no new measures shonld be con. sidered. At the same time, he must say, that what hsc occurred satisfied him more and more that, had such a sestrictioa been imposed even in the present session, public business would have been in aenoro advanced state in the other House of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Unless strongly urged, however, he should not take upon himself to move a resolution to this effect, though it would, he believed, tend much to expedite business and be much more satiafactory to all their lordships. After a short pause, The Earl of MALMESBURY expressed surprise that no member of the Government thought this question deserving of notice. Earl GRANVIILE (who -was heard at intervals in thc gallery) was understood to say that the Government had been in communication with the noble lord (Redesdale) on the subject, and were of opinion that, considering the peculiar circumstances of the present session, it would be inexpedient to fix a day after which new BiUs should bc considered by their lordships, Tho Earlof DERBYr should very much regret if theis lordships allowed this session to pass over without adhering to the principle of fixing some day after which Bils coming from the other House could not be proceeded with, and he still hoped that Her Majesty's Government would take intc consideration the fixing of suck a day. The Government could easily ascertain how much business they intended tc bring be2ore 'Parliament. UJnless they restrained to a certain extent the bringisin of new Bills, he should think, looking at the number of BiU before the House of Commnons, thati it would be necessary to prolong the session till October. METROPOLITAN TOLLGATES. Lord RAVENSWORTH, in rising to put aiquestion to the President of the Council with respect to the toligateE within the six-mile radius north of the Tbames, said that they were a great public inconvenience. It was only 3C years since every approach to the metropolis was a turn. pike-road; but by the exertions of the Government of that day, and especially, he believed by the energies of the noble earl behind'him (the Earl of Lonsdale), who was then Chief Commissioner of the Board of Works, many of the turn. pikes were removed. Ho understood that all the Principal metropolitan tolDgates were contracted for by a gentleman of the Hebrew persuasion of the appropriate name of Levy, whohadfora certain sum provided the fundsformaintaining the tollgates and paying the wages of the tollgate keepers. He wasfully awarof the diEfculty of putting an end to the levy. ing of these tolls, but as the matter was much mooted out of doors and the tolls wero felt to be very burdensome, he hoped that Her Majesty's Government would make some attempt to relieve the publio from them. He understood that a deputation had actually waited upon the noble lord at the head of the Government to remonstrate in strong terms on the continuance of those tols which had been left unassailed by the noble earl behind him. Re begged, at the same time, to observe that no was opposed. to the abolition of the tolls by means of an additional rate to purehase the fee simple of them, because he found that the rates of the metropolitau districts were already exceedingly heavy, the ratepayers in the parish of Fulham for instance having to pay rates to the extent of 9s. in the pound. He begged to ask whether Her Majesty's Government had considered the application made to the First Lord of the Treasury on the 20th of May hst by a deputation from parties calling themselves the 'oll Reform Ccmmittee, who prayed that Her Majesty's Government would introduce a measure for an earl removal of the tollgates within the six-milo radius eorth of the Thames, and now under the control of the Metropos Road Commissioners, and wbether the noble lord (the Lord President of the Council) could give any assurance that so desirable a measure was in course of preparation ? Earl GRANVILLE said, there could be no doubt that it would be a very desirable thing to accomplish the object which the noble lord had in view. Tho successful exertions of the noble earl opposite (the Earl of Lonsdale) for several years to diminish the evil complained of entitled him to the greatest credit. (Eear, hear.) The difficulties, however, snce that imnrovement had been effected had been increased rather than diminished. At the same time he must admit that the subject deserved attention, but it was now too late in the session to propose any measure respecting it. His right hon. friend would take it into his consideration during the recess, and put himself in communication with the Metro. polls Road Commissioners with the view of tacing, if possible, some steps with regard to it. After a few words from the Earl of LONSDmtLE and Lord BRouvssm the subject dropped. MONUMENT TO LORD RAGLAN. Earl FORTESCOE; rose, pursuant to notice, to inquire whether it was the intentionof Her Majesty'sGovernmentto erect a monument to the late Lord Raglan? He said,My Lords, I wish to state as shortly as possible the reasons which impelme to ask this question, and the grounds which induce mo to hope that the noble lord the Secretary for War, if he ahould not feel it consistent with his duty to answer me at once in the affirmative, will at least receive the suggestion I am about to make in a friendly and favourable spirit as a matter for future consideration. About 18 months have now elapsed since the close of the late war, and 'what have been fitly described as the choicest rewards for the gallantry of our troops were some time since bestowed by the hand of the Sovereign upon their fortunate possessors. The events of that war will henceforth belong to the province of the historian, and, In briefly alluding to some of those events which had an important bearing on the conduct and character of Lord Raglan, I shbAl confine myself strictly to what rests upon incontestable authority, and shaill call in question as little as possible the conduct of other parties. The expedition to the Crimea was determined upon jointly by the Governmenim of France and of England as early as July, 1864. Dif;erences, however, occurred to delay its execution tiU the September of that year. But on the 8th of that month, -when the t*oops were actually on their way for the Crimea, doubts and'difficultiea arose in the minds of scme of the French generals which made it uncertain whether the expedition would be conducted to the place for which it was dt first designed. And it required all the energy, aU lthe address, and all the influence which Lord Raglan possessed in the councils of ovr allies to induce them to adhere to the destination originally selected. TXhat influence ha3ppily prevailed. Tbelandingatthe point suggested by Lord Rgglaa was efected withoutbtheloss nf a single boat or a single man, and was shortly folowed by the expulsion of 'the Russian troops from the heights a Cove the Alma in lite more than as many hours at they hac expected to hold thorn weeks agasnst any forcewith which we could assail them. It is well known that Lord Raglan inmmediately after that victory urged the pur 6nit of tho enemy. It has been admitted by the R ussians themselves that had that bold counsel been acted upon Sebastopol would have been ours in a few davs, and all the distress and privation endured by our army during that memorabla winter would have been spared. A nd here let me say that the British public and the British press were very unjust in the am ount of censure they cast upon all those who abroad and at home were conneoted with the Crimean expedition for not having taken beforehand all the measures which were necemsary to provide for the comfort and convenience of our troops while passing that rigorous season before Sebastopol It will be recollected that the expedition was undertaken with the fell, I might almost say, with the enthusiastic assent of all parties in this country; ard it was confidently anticipated that Sebastopol would fall within,, few weeks after the siege was commenced. On two or three separate occasions a report w cIrculated and currently believed in England and in Thnoe that Sebastopol was actually in our hands. It is no putr of my busineis to justify all that was done or al that wao omitted in this case. But with the expecta$ODo generally untertaired by the publiC a ho the Issu^ ot this enterprise, and which there was reason to sppose would have been realized had Lord Rag. lans aldvico iean followed in the first instance, I do not think the British people would hava viewed with any degree 44complacency the incurring of any large expense in the psreparalion of winter accommodation which they believed wouli never be wanted. To return, however, to the evente of the campaign. After the battle of Inkermann Similar advioe was given by Lord Raglan, and nfortunately re. jected, with respect to the pursuit of the disordered masses of the Russian army. I understand that the gallant and high-mninded officer who sucoeeded Marakal St. Arnaud in command of thelFreuch army has unkesitatingly ascknow. ledged that, in not following the coumesl of Lord Raglan on that occasion, he committed a grave error and lost a great opportunity. I will touch lightly on the expedition to Kertch. The-pla originated with LordaRaglan; its execution was delayed, itwas abandoned at theeleventh hour, after theBritish contingent was actually embarked. It was again resumed tbree weeks afterwards7 andearried out with an amount of success which left nothing to be regretted exoept that it was not undertaken a considerable time before. I now approach with more pain the last of the instances in which the plan agreed upon between Lord Raglan and the French generals was altered at the eleventh hour-in which, on the 18th of June, that bombardment with which Lord Raglan proposed to preface the wssault upon the Redan was given up, and the hour of the attack altered under circumstances which led him to apprehend a failure that would cost him the flower of his army. Because it must be remembered that the bravest and best soldiers are generally amone those who faUl on such occasions. The distress and vexation caused to Lord Raglan by this unhappy failure so preyed upon his mind as, if we are not much misinformed, within 10 short days afterwards to have brought him to his grave. But from this sad event I turn with more satisfac. tion to the page of history which will record the personal qualifications of Lord Raglan. The historian will note, I am sure, with patriotic pride, that imperturbable gallantry in the field so well described by rshal St. Arnaud -no mean judge of the military qualities of as gene. ral-as worthy of the heroes of ancient times. Amid reverses and distresses he preserved an undaunted spirit, and combined this with a frank courtesy of manner that won the hearts and affections and convinced the under. standings of aU those that were about ihim. The historian of this war Wil not omit to notice his constant exertions to promote the confort and alleviate the distresses of his soldiers, or the enthusiastic affection with which he was received by those soldiers upon every occasion when he was recognized by any portion of them during his frequent and unostentatious visits by day or by night. It is not remarkable that Lord Raglan, with his singular modesty of mind, should not have valued himself upon those qualities which he regarded as the common attributes of a soldier or among the simplest merits of a commander. If It be asked how it happened that a man of his energy and promptitude never thought to justify himself from the charges which were brought against him of slowness and inaction, I reply, that Lord Raglan never suffered a line to go forth from his pen which would convey an idea of any difference of opinion between himself and the general in command of our alies, because in the true spirit of a patriot and a hero he preferred to take upon himself shortcomings not his own. These are the grounds, my lords, upon which I ask Her Majesty's Government whether it is their intention to confer upon Lord Raglan that distinction which has been conferred upon other commanders who have died in the service of their country. Shall I be told by m noble friend that with tho single exceptions of Lord Heatheld and the Duke of Wellington no public monument has ever been erected to any general officer who has not been killed in the field? My lords, if my noble friend can find me a recedent of a general officer in command of an army who, within six months after his appointment, and within three months after the departure of his expedition,wontwo of the test battles on record-battles of such importance as entitled him at the end of the second battle to receive that highest step in the military service which was not accorded to the Dake of Weluington until after aie battle of Vittoria, in the fifth year of his glorious campaign-if my noble friend can show me any such precedent I wil admit the force of his objection. (Hear.) Although Lord Raglan did not fall by the bullet or the steel of an enemy, he died in the fill rformance of his laborious duties up to within 48 hours of death, for the last despatch that he wrote was dated on the 26th of June. The manner of his death has been described by the pen of one who was the constant associate of his labours in the field and in the campaign, and the sorrowing witness of his last moments. He says:- "Toiling always from the early morning and continuing his labours deep into the night, and bearing in his own noble way those cares and sorrows which faU to the lot of a British commander in the field, he sak and died in the midst of us all at head-quarters before his great task was done; but if there was glory for the allies in the fall of Sebastopol, it winl sooner or later be seen and understood, and be thenceforth remembered, that that great result was prepared by the audacity of the original invasion and the enduring heroism of the winter campaign ; and the more the singular history of those transactions shall become known the greater will be the pride with which our countrymen will cherish Lord Raglan's fame." My lords, these are the words of General Airey in his viun. dication cf his chief before the Board of General Officers, and I will not weaken the effect of his remarks by a single word of my own. I will only say that in what I have spoken I have not been actuated by any feeling of personal friendship, because my acquaintance with Lord Raglan was but slight. But, as a humble member of your lordshi House, and also as ahumble member of that great pub which, although it may sometimes be misled as to the merits of public men, always desires to do justice to those who, like Lord Raglan, have maintained the honour of theBritish army under difficult circumstances, and whose life was devoted to the profession to which he belonged and to the countrywhich heserved(cheers),Ibegtoaskwhether itis the intention of Her Majesty's Government, orwhether they will be prepared at a more favourable time, to consider the cquestion of erecting a public monument to the late Lord Raglan ? (Hear, hear.) Lord PANMURE.-I have listened with the greate3t satisfaction to the tribute which my noble friend has thought It right to pay to the merits of Lord Raglan. And he must not suppose, and I trust your lordships will not suppose, that because Her Majesty's Government have not proposed to the other House of Parliament a vote for a marble monument to his memory, it is because they under. value the servi ces he rendered to the country, or from any feeling that those servlces were not attended with great and beneficial results to this country. (Hear, hear.) I will not follow my noble friend through all the history upon which he has entered, and all the justifications that he has thought it necessary to make of Lord Raglan's military services. I think, my lords, you will not say that the public of this country failed to express their opinion upon the un. happy death of the gallant generaL The public have marked their sense of his great actions by expressing in both Houses of Parliament their testimony of those actions, in according to his family the means of sustaining the honour of tho peerage. This, my lords, was no mere matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. I look upon it as a public testimony to the public services of Lord Raglan, and in that spirit alone It was proposed. With regard to pubLe monuments, however, a Government is compelled to be cautious how they distribute thoee honours. I believe that in the military history of our country, with the exceptions my noble friend has pointed out, every publio monument on the walls, either of the cathedral in the city of London or of the minster in this city, has been dedicated to military commanders who have fallen in the execution of their duty. I cannot trace a soldier who has a monument, with the exception of Lord Heathfield, who did not die before the enemy or of wounds received in battle. And what, my lords, were the actions of Lord Heathfield? He defended and maintained against an overwhelming force that fortress which is the bright. est jewel of the British Crown-the fortress of Gibraltar. But, my lords, LordlEglanwill not be without a monument; Parhament has voted alarge sUn of money-nearly 20,0001. -for the purpose of raising in the land rendered glorious by their gallant actions a monument dedicated to the memory of all Her Majesty's soldiers, sailors, and marines who fell in the Crimea. The most conspicuous object as one approaches Constantinople will be that monument, raised by England in honour of her sons (hear, hear), and the first name that will be inscribed upon that monument wil be the name of Lord Raglan (hear), in association with those of his gallant comrades in arms who perished in the late war. In making this statement in answer to the question of my noble friend I do not mean to say that the Government may not at some future period entertain the subject of erecting a memorial to Lord Raglan in this country. (Hear, hear.) But a monument, whether erected in honour of a statesman or a warrior, should be erected in obedience to the opinion and approbation of the whole community, in order to render it of a nature corresponding to thoso services of the highest character which either a statesman or a soldier can perform. (Hear, hear.) Lord BROUGCHAX.-If, my lords, we were to dwell upon the private virtues only by which Lord Raglan was distinguished, upon that gentle nature which is ever found in alliance with the most brilliant courage (hear, hear); if we were to confine our estimate of his character to the consideration of the great services which during a long life devoted to his country he rendered to her in departments of the greatest pablo utilty; if we were merely to reflect that from his earliest years-when, to the astonishment of his young contemporaries, hewassingledout by the unerring sagacity of that great captain whose loss we have all to deplore-be was attached to the person and continued to be the associate both at home and abroad of his illustrious chief, who had he happily *been spared to us would to-day have been perform. ix'g that duty which we are now feebly attempting to dis. ch,irge with all the irresistible force of his high authorityif 1 say we were not to go beyond those considerations, then shou2d we find in Lord Raglan's eareer ample scope for those culogi ums which my noble friend opposite has this evening pronotauced. (Hear, hear.) But it is in another capacity that we ,are called upon to view his great prkio services upon thksW occasion. We are called upon to regard him as occupyin g the position of first in command of the most arduous expedition that perhaps ever left our shoreswhen, labourilg under difficulties all but overwhelming, he led our troops and those of our allies-with whomhis kindly nature and his uliobtrusive wisdom enabled him to preserve an undeviating fr,:endship (hear, hear)-to the achievement of a victory for w2.ich in some respects a parallel even in the proud military 5nnals of his country can scarcely be found. (Cheers.) W 'have, moreover,my lords, to accord the tribute of our highs.st admiration to that joint landing of the troops of both arL'ieS on the shores of the Crmea,| which I have heard both ,,nlitar and nsav men cuerac-~ terize as a feat, requiring the test experience, cad as worthy of thP, greatest praim w ich it is possible to confer upon the, oparations of a military leader. To Lord RAglan's prudence and wisdom, my lords, do we owe the uccesa of that critical movement. Marshal St. Arnaud, of whom no man can wish to speak without expressing regret for his loss and the utmost admiration for his Talour, and who was at the time laboouring under that disea which, unhappily, subseguently proved mortal, refused at first to concur m such a movement: but when urged by Lord Raglan, who advanced in suport of his views arguments characterized at once by that irmnes and that kindly forbearance for which he was so reuark able, Marshal St. Arnaud ceased to oppose the project. It was owing to no fault of Lord Raglan that that project did not produce its anticipated results. The battle of the alma was fought, and in 48 hours after that glorious achievement, had Lord Raglan'e advice been followed, our troops would have been in possession of Sebastopol. (Hear, hesr.) I make that statement upon the best of all authority-.he confession of the enemy himself. (Hear, hear.) Iustead, however, of advancing against Sebastopol after the heights of Alma had been won, that famous march took ulace which reflect the highest honour upon the ltataents of the commander, but which unhappily led to only one or two other victories almost as glorious but almost as fruitless as that by which it was preceded, and to the consequent prolongation of hotilities. The victory, nevertheless, was ours; and to whom can we ascribe our success if not to Lord Raglan? From the commencement of the contest alImost to its close,-when, unhappily he fell a victim to disease, brought on partly by the severity of the climate, but still more by that mental anxiety and those cruel disappointments under which hig noble spirit suffered-to him we are indebted for those great deeds which-if an thing could do so-have added fresh lustre to the arms of Iugland. (Hear, hear.) And shall we not, my lords, commemorate acts so distinguished? (Cheers.) Shall webegrudge-Iwill not say asa matter of economy-butupon the score of a servileadherenceto precedent, uponwhichmy rnoble friend opposite (LordPanmure) seems to rely-that monument, the erection of which Iventureto saypublic opinion and national feeling ar prepared not only to accept as a proceeding which is desirable, but to demand as one which is due to the memory of that illustrious chief who perished in the Crimea ? (Hear, hear.) I am well aware, my lord3, that it requires no monument to hand down to future ages deeds such as his. It has been said by great men of antiquty of their distingmshed contemporaries, "The whole earth, the whole world, is their monament." (Cheers.) I think, nevertheless, my lords, that in yielding to those prejudices in favour of local associations which prevail we should do well. I should therefore urge upon Her Majesty's Government the propriety of erectimg a monument to Lord Raglan in this country-not, indeed, to perpetuate his fame, for it stands in nee of no such aid to live on for ever-but for our own sakes, for our own honour, and in the hope that others may he stimulated to follow his bright example. (Cheers.) The Earl of DERBY.-Asno motion has been made upon this occasion, it may, perhaps, be deemed irregular to enter into a discussion with reference to the subject under our consideration. I cannot, however, my lords, resist the impulse which prompts me to pay the fervent tribute of my admiration to great and singular merits such as those by which Lord Raglan was characterized, and at the same time to express my great regret at the answer which has been given upon the part of Her lIajesty's Ministers to the question which has been put to them by my noble friend opposite. (Hear, hear.) I cannot help thinking that my noble friend in introducing the subject to our notice dwelt rather more exclusively than was necessary upon the expedition to the Crimea as conferring upon Lord Raglan a claim to public gratitude. His claims to that gratitude occupy, in my opinion, a much wider field. Ibe'aeve thereis in history scarcely anyrecord of a public mau-I hardly except the Duke of Wellingtonrho for so long a time devoted his unwearied energies and his great talents in the highest and most important offices to the military service of his country as Lord Raglan But, distinguished as were the merits displayed by Lord Raglan in the Crimea, and valuable as were his services, these were not more distingaished than was his conduc. considering the position which he occupled in this countrr, considering his time of life, in undertaking the arduous and difficult duty of commanding the expedition to the East.. (Hear, hear.) Well, my lords, the noble lord has given what I must consider a direct refusal to accede to the re quest of the noble earl to erect a monument to Lord Raglan. It is not altogether, indeed, a refusal, because, after stating all the reasons why Her Majesty's Government could not accede to the request, he added that he begged that what he bad stated mlght not be considered an absolute decision upon the part of the Government, for that they would at some more convenient or suitable season take the matter into their consideration. Lord PANTMURE.-The noble earl is putting into my month words which I never used. Those were the words used in the question of the noble earl, but they were not used by me. The Earl of DERBY.-Well then, a more favourable opportunity. Lord PANMURE.-I did not use that expression. The Earl of DERBY.-I hope the noble lord will pardon me, but I certainly understood him to use that expression; but if he now disclaims it- Lord PANMURE (with some warmth).-I do not disclaim the expression. I utterly deny having ever used it. The Earl of DERBY.-Well, then, my ears deceived in, for I certainly thought that I heard the noble lord say that at a more favourable season the Government would take the matter into consideration; and, if I am not much mistaken, the error which I committed was committed by many who sit near me (hear, hear); for I believe that more than one noble lord was under the same opinion as myself, that the noble baron did say that the Government would at a more favourable season take the matter into their consideration. Lord PANMURE..-Iagainutterlydenythat I used tho.e words, and I am surprised that the noble earl will not accept from a gentleman a denial such as I have already given, for I have already said that I never used those words. The Earl of DERBY.-The noble lord is making a very unnecessary display of temper (hear, hear), for I have accepted his denial, and have stated that my ears deceived me. Earl FORTESCUE.-Probably the noble earl has misuc. derstood what feU from myself and that which was stated by my noble friend. The question which I asked wax, whether the Government would take the matter into condderation at some more favourable period. The Earl of DERBY.-Certainly that was the question of the noble earl; but, while I accept the denial of the noble lord, I can only say that my ears deceived me, for I thought that I heard the noble baron adopt the words "a more favourable period" in his reply. Of course I accept the denial of the noble baron, but, unless I am greatly mistaken, many noble lords were of the same opinion as myself. The noble lord has founded his refusal to accede to the proposal of the noble earl upontwo grounds. First of all hesaid thatit was not customary to give a monument to anyjofficers who had not distinguished themselves by great and signal services to their country; and in the next place, he stated that it was not customary to erect a monument to any military officer who had not actually fallen in battle or died from the effect of his wounds. Now, my lords, with regard to the first point I am not wlling to draw the inference which can naturally be drawn from that statement. I wiU not admit that Lord Raglan has not deserved a monument because he has not rendered the greatest and most signal services to his country. (Hear, hear.) I believe that his devotion to the public service, his great talents, the many admirable qualities which he displayed both as a soldier and as a civilian (hear, hear), his long services in the Peniusula (hear, hear), his services at Waterloo (hear, hear), his 25 years service at the Horse Guards (hear, hear), his ready acoeptance of the arduous duty of commanding the expedition to the Crimea (hear, hear), his many struzsgec against7almost overwhelming difficulties-difficulties under which any ordinary man would have sunk-the confidence with which he inspired not only his own troops, but those who were associated with them, the general esteem in which he was held by all, as we kxow upon the universal testimony of evey man who held high command under him in the rimea, the services he rendered to the common cause, his eminent military services,-all these entitle him to be placed in that cate oryof men upon whom monuments ought to be conferred. (Cheers.) Then again, with regard to the second point advanced by the noble lord, that it was not customary to confer a monument upon a military or naval commander unless he fell in battle or died of wounds-[Lord Panmure.-I did not say naval officer.] But, surely, the expression "military" in this sense includes officers of both services, and there are many instances in which officers in the military service of the country have deserved well of the country, and have had a monument erected to their memory although they have not falen in battle or died of wounds. Lord Collingwood did not die in battle or of wounds, hut a monument was erected to his memory. Lord St. Vincent was treated similarly, and I am not quite sure, but I think that Lord CornwalDis had a monument erected to him also. Historically, therefore, the objection of the noble lord is not a valid one; but I go still further, and I say that if there ever was a man of whom it could be said that he died in the service of his country Lord Raglan was that man. (Lond cries of "Hear, hear.") He did not fall in battle; his death was a more wasting and painful one; but as much as any man ever did he died through devotion to his country and from efforts made in her cause. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord has referred to the services of Lord Raglan being recognized by his name standing first in a memorial to be erected to the memory of those who fell in the war. I, my lords, cannot accept that as a sufficient recognition of his services. I cannot say that, in a monument raised to the memory of all those brave men who fell in the campaign, the single fact of his name appearing first is a sufficient testimony of the gratitude which this country ought to feel, and which I believe it does feel (hear, hear), for the conduct and the merit of the Commander in-Chief. I should like to know, my lords, when will be the time more favourable for the Government to consider this proposal than the present? (Hear, hear.) Ib is now morn than two years since the death of Lord Raglan. In the course of those two years have Her Majestv's Ministers been unable to makeup their minds as to whhether the character and services of Lord Raglan were deserving or undeserving of a statue (heai, hear); or is it that the Government are waiting to see what pressure may be put upon them by the public before they give efect to the wishes of the Crown, and I believe the ~vses of the people? I confess, my lords, that I was sorry then I heard that the noble earl had given notice of ,binging this question before your lordships. I was sorry, ~because Ifelt that if the Governmentaccepted his proposal agrsatdegree of grace would be taken from the act while, on the other band, if they refna. to accede to it, then a slight would be cast upon the menier otLox4~agsn, ll 4dito~toD tbOSO pudO- arVe. obloquies which when he was absent were cast Lpom him in bis lifetime by some, My lords, there is no question before the House, andI am aware that I have been irregular in making these observations, but I felt it to be impossible for me not to express the deep regret with which I heard the doubt expressed-the more than doubt implied by the Government-as to the merits of Lord Raglan bemg deserving of a monument to his memory. (Cheers.) Earl GRANV LE.-I do not rise to prolong a discus Bion the tone of portions of which has been that whlch I much regret. The noble earl has accused my noble friend of making an unnecessary display of temper. I saw no such display, and I do not think it unnatural that my noble friend should object to words being placed in his mouth which he did not believe he had used. I do not rise, I repeat, to prolong this discussion, but merely to say, on behalf of myself and my colleagaes, that having carefully notedeverywordwhich has fallen fromthenobleearl in praise of Lord Raglan we agree in every word of that praise. But at the same time we do not feel caUed upon at once to make a declaration as to whether we shall propose the erection of a monument to his memory, without reference to other circumstances than his admirable qualities and the noble manner in which he always discharged his duties. The noble earl has twitted the Government with waiting to see how far publc opinion may turn in this direction. Now, I utterly deny that such is the case; but atthe same time I think that we ought to consider in a question like this other subjects besides the great qualities of Lord Raglan. We must, for one thing, consider the feelings of his relatives, and also whether it would be desirable for his own reputation and for the good of those interested in that reputation to take a step which we were not entirely certain would meet with thefullconcurrenceof the nation. Ido not say that such would not be tho case, bat what I say is that, for the interest of the reputation of Lord Raglan, such a step as proposing a monument to his memory ought not to be taken without a perfect certaintyof that concurrence for unquestionably the valre of such a memorial wonld be greatly diminished if it were ouly agreed to after many objections had been raised to it. I will nowv only add that in every euloginm passed by the noble earl upon lord Raglan I most cordially and heartily concur. The Dake of BEAUFORT.-I mnst confess, my lord that I have heard with great pleasure the last words of the noble earl with reference to my noble relative, for duringthe time that the noble lord the Secretary for War was addressing the Honsehe neversaidone single wordin praisoof that great man who carried out to his bed endeavour the orders he received from the noble lord. In adopting that course, however, the noble lord has only performed the crowning act of his treatment of my gallant relative, for during his lifetime lord Raglan was treated by the noble lord in a manner which very few men would have had the temper to put up with, and now the noble lord takes this op. portunity of by his silenoe disparaging his memory. Lord Panmure made a gesture of dissent.] The noble lord shook his head, hut it seemed to him (the Dnke of Beaufort) that the last sentence of his speech warranted this expression. The subject was then allowed to drop. BRTISHU GUIANA. The Marquis of CLAIRICARDE rose, in the absence of Earl Grey, to present a petition from Guiana, praying for the removal of certain impediments to the importation of free labourers into that colony. The noble marquis stated that this colony had an area of no less than 70,000 square miles, or 50,000,000 of acres, every one of which was of the greatest fertility, and as capable of producing tropical crops as any part of the worl It was a reproach to us that instead of increasing the amount of its production was diminished. The reason of this was the want of labour, and the petition which he had now the honour to present complained of certain restrictions and provlsions which pre. vented the lmmigration of free labourers into that colony. He rested his support of the petition, the prayer of which was for a relaxation of these restrictions, upon two most important grounds-one, the importance and necessity of discouraging the slavetrade; andthe other, the advantages which would be derived by the colony and by the mother countryfrom the increase of free labour in Guiana. At present the state of Africa, the transactions in which other conn. tries were engaged there, and the discussions in which Her Majesty's Government were engaged, rendered it impossible that we should seek to obtain free emigration from that country without indirectly encouraging the slavetrade. This wasfuUyrecognized by thepetitionera ;but,at the sametime, to say that itwouldalways,or even formanyyears,beimpossible to obtain a supply of labour from its overflow in Africa would be to exclude that country from the benefit of one great element of civilization. He had heard with great regret the statement made by the noble and learned lord (Lord Brougham) as to the imperfect success which had attended the struggles in which be and those with whom he was so honourably associated had been engaged to put an end to slavery. Despite their struggles the slave trade was now far from being extnct. Within the last year it was carried on to a great extent, and until we showed that we could compete with it by means of an adeqnate supply of free labonr it would continue. To show how necessary it was that Parliament and the Government should be sinoere and active in assisting the colonists in this matter, he stated that In 1831 the Britsh West Indian colonies, then cultivated by slave labour, proeduced 205,000 tons of suar. The Spanish colonies, Cuba and Porto Rico, produced 110,000 tons. In the year 1856 the British West Indies produced only 140,000 tons of sugar, showing a diminution of 60.000 tons, notwithstanding the increase of population and of the requirements of this country; while on the other hand the Spanish colonies, so far as could be ascertained, produced 450,000 tons, showing an increase in the production of that slave cowuntry of 350,000 tons. Thus while the quantity of sugar produced by slave labour in 1831 was only 315,000 tons, in 1856 it was 450,000. At present no cotton was produced In British' Guiana, while the quantity of coffee bad diminished to something under 100,0001b.-little more than one-third of the quantity formerly exported. This showed that if it was reaUy wished that our colonies should contend with the slave countries they ought to be allowed liberty to procure labour, and also assistance in obtaining it. Oat of 50,000,000 acres of probably as fertile land as any in the world there were at present under cultivation only about 60,000 acres. The necessity for labour was therefore apparent, and it was worthy of remark that the labourers there not only got good wages but rapidly accumulated fortunes. Not a shi sailed hack with them to India, according to the terms of the contract, which did not also carry several thousand pounds of their earnings. They had also an opportunity of S Inireal roprty,ad in one parish alone he bMiemy4Y that 0,000 acreasn were posesed by persons who came out there to work for hire. Bnt more labour was required, and in his opinion it was to be had. Setting Africa out of the question, India and China formed two great sources whence immigrants might be derived. The only emigration from India, however, was carried on by Government agents, and this arrangement was most unsatisfactory, because it was impossible that those Persons should possess the same judgment in selecting the proper emigrants and should be animated bythe same zeal as the colonists themselves or such agents as they might appoint. The most absurd regulation was, however, that at Calcutta the Government agent would not allow more than 350 cooes to embark in any ship, no matter what was its tonnage and capacity. This regulation appeared so monstrous that he could with difficulty believe it, and he was astonished, therefore, to find his right hon. friend (Mr. Labonchere) not only admitting the practice, but justfying it on the ground that it would be cheaper for the colony to use small vessels than large ones. Then the only Government agents were at Calcutta and Madras, though he believed one was shortly to.he stationed at Bombay. But, in addition to the facilities offered in India for obtaining labour, the petitioners directed their attention to China. It seemed to him quite wonderful that the Government should have thong t it necessary to prohibit the importation of coolies from China. This step was taken, it was said, in couse. quence of a report from Sir John BowriDg, putting forward the objections entertained by the Chinese to the emigration of their women. He (the Marquis of Clanricarde), however, had some doubts how far these objections really existed. They aU kneow the state of the lower classes in China and the condition of their women, and was it possible to believe that the poorer class of women could not be induced to emigrate without fraud or violence when they lived in the state which had so often been described, and had their female children drowned like puppies before their eyes ? Under such circumstances could it be supposed that the Chinese women were so happv that by violence or fraud alone could you induce them to emirate? The lmportation of Chinese into the British West Ifdies ceased, he believed, in 18L4. Up to that time only 2,107 were introduced, who were found to be most industrious labourers; while in Cuba, where there were slaves, and the slave trade to keep up the supply, 7,700 Chinese had been imported Not only had this oeeu the case, but in the first three narters of 1856 4,485 Chinese were shipped for Cuba, and ,879 were landed there. He did think the condition of tnese colonies required their lordships'serious consideration. It was impossible to doubt that the fertile lands which composed them would one day be of the greatest value to this country. We were at present endeavouring to introduce e cutivation of cotton into some of our own possessions, inorder that they might compete with the slave-grow ctoofteUie States. Wel3, cotton to any exhten COUld be grown in Guiana if labour could only be found, as he beieved it might, without at the same time introducing savery in disguise. He now, in conclusion, begged leave to lay this petition on the table, recommending it to the attention of tneir lordships and of the Government. Earl GRANVILLE said the Government were fully alive to the importance of furnishing an adeq.uate supply of labour to these colonies, and the only restrictons they were desirous to impose were such as they thought themselves bound to lay down for the protection of the coolies. They were determined not to encourage anything like slavery in the colonies ; they were determined also not to alow in the traffic of coolies any approach to the horrors of the middle passage; and, lastly, they were determined to provide for the return of those persons to india after they had fulfilled their engagements. Many of the regalations which appeared to be vexatious were absolutely necessary for the protection of these labourers. It was indispensably necessary, for instance, that they should be employed through the medium of a Government agent, for otherwise great disturbances might be occasoned in the country from which they emigrated, and there might be a chance of reviving the slave trade. In China, where there were no agents, riots were frequently occasioned by the attempts made to carry away Chinese labourers to our colonies. The noble marquis must admit that these things ought to be avoided. He believed that by the law of China not only women but men were prohibited from emigrating. Lord Elgin had undertaken to inquire into the matter, and see whether any mode could be adopted by which Chinese labourers could be supplied to our coloIes. While Her Majesty's Government were convinced of the absolute necessity of imposing some restrictions on the importation of these labourers into our colonies, they at the same time had every desire to encourage the importalion of free labour Into them, in order tha t their great natural resources aight be developed as much as possible. Lord BROUGHAM said, nothing could be more distinct OX cAd1d thin &9 Atsement of the noble maruis., His object was a very Important one, and he must sdmit that Her Majesty's Government were desirous of introducing into our colonies as much free labour as was required to meet the wanta and complaints of the petitioners and those who were in a similar position. But tho great difficulty was how to do that, as his noble friend the President of the Council had said, without risking a renewal of the slave trade, of internal wars in the countries from which these labourers might be taken, of frauds and violence, the horrors of the middle pasge, and, in fact, all the evils attendant upon that trade. The intervention of the agents complained of by the petitioners was absolutely necessary to prvent those abuses to which he had adverted a few evenings ago in submitting a motion on the subject of the slave trade. In fact, even in England, it was found necessary to require, under the severest penalties, that a Government agent should be informed of every emigrant put on boazd for the purpose of bein conveyed to Canada, Nov Scotia,or elsewhvere. Howmuch more important, then, was it that imir regulations should be exacted with regard to Indin and Chinese labourers? Persons who had fullyexaminedthis subject were of opinion that the existing regulations should not be relaxed in the slightest degree.

L1NATICS (SCOTLAND) BILL. The BiUL, as amended, was considered, and was ordered to be read athird time on Monday next. POLICE (SCOTLAND) BILL. On the motion for going into committee on this Bill, Sir J. OGILVY expressed his objection to the principle of centraization which was involved in the measure, as opposed to the principlo of local self-government, which was dear to the people of Scotland, and to the loss of which they would not submit without a straggle. He was aware that theprinple in question had been introduced into the glish olice Act; but he submitted that if the principle wereerroneous, thatwas noreson whyit should beembodied in the Police Act of Scotland; and he contended that it behoved the Scotch members to resist this argument at the outset, otherwise it would he drawn into a precedent, and whenever upon a future occasion they might think proper to oppose the principle of centralization they would be told that tKey were too late, for It had already been adopted bothiin Scotland and in England. The ed lord no doubt would endeavour to persuade the House that it was necessary that the Secretary of State for the Home Departraent shouldhave a controlling power over the police force inasmuch as the BiU provided that under certain circumstancee the Imperia Exchequer should grant a sum towards the expens of the force not exceedingone-fourth. He (Sir J. Oglvy) objected to ths proposition as an attempt to bribe the people of Scotland, and he trusted that the Lord-Advocate would concede the pont with reference to local selfgovernment, which he had, in the discharge of his duty, ventured to urge pon the House. The LORD-ADVOCATE said that he would state his views upon the subject when the particular clauses came under consideration. The House then went into committee on the Bill, Mr. F=RZoy in the chair, and clauses l and 2 were agreed to. On clause 3, Sir J. OGILVY proposed, after the word "government," to leave out the words " pay, clothing, and accontrements and necessaries." The LORD-ADVOCATE said that he would take this opportunity of answering the remarks of the hon. baronet the member for Dundee with respect to local self-government. The clause with reference to the interference of the Secretary of State was word for word the same as had been introduced into the English Act. The Government came forward to take a certain share in the expense of maintaining the police force, and they naturally stipulated that the same powers should be given to the Secretary of Stato in Scotland aswere giventohim inEngland. Hethoughtthat the country genhtemen in England were just as jealous of centralization as the Commissioners of Supply in Scotland could possibly bel still the English Bill had been passed, and it was found so work extremelywell. The principle of local self-government was a perfectly sound one if properly carried out, but he could mention one or two facts which his hon. friend the member for Dundee might ponder on with advantag. The upuer ward of Lanarkshire, for example, did not possess a iangle polioeman. So much for local self-government I A man accused of crime in the county of Midlothian had only to step across to the counts of Lanark, and there was not a single policeman there to apprehendhim. Again, in Autumn last a riot occurred in the town of Kelso, and the mob assembled burned down a Roman Catholic ChapeL Local self-government was represented there by a superintendent of police and one man, and on the trial of the rioters the superinendent and his man were examined as to what they had done. They stated that they had gone as close to the spot as they dared, but that they had bcen received with such a volley of stones that they had thought it well to retreat to their homes. (A laugh.) He (the Lord Advocate) did not mean to say that this was the general state of things in Scotland, but hementionedthese instances to show wrhat might occur under local self-government. He assured the committee that there was nothing to be apprehensive of in the amount of centralization which was contemplated by Mr. C. BRUCE thought that there was a good deal in what had been stated by the hon. baronet the member for Dundee, and that the principle of centralization was carried a great deal too far. Every one mnst admit that it was essential that it should be compulsory on every conntyio Scotland to establish anefficlent police force; but he thought that al the minor details, such as pay, clothing, accoutrements, and so on, should be left in the hands of the Commissioners of Supply, who were quite adequate for the parpose. The great defect in the Bill was, in his opinion, that it did not provide for the appointment of a good central force of detective police, whose services would be extremely valuable in Scotland, espeCally if they were a moveable foroe, which might be sent to any part of the country where an emergency arose. Colonel SY}EEl, Mr. EwART, and Lord BELGuND supported the amendment. Sir G. GREY said that the power given to the Secretary of State had not been first conferred by the Act of last sessdon, but had existed ever since the original Act which was passed when Lord Normanby was Secretary of State, 20 years ago. The rules laid dowrn by the Secretary were of the most general character, being calculated mainly to insure uniformity in the management and control of the police force;- and he was not aware that any objection had ever been taken in England to the exercise of the power in question. Mr. DuNLop and Mr. STEuART opposed the amendment, and after some further discusslon, in which Mr. BLICIituRN, Mr. SmOLLETT, Mr. STrIRLG, Sir J. A)EDERsoN and others shared, the committee divided, when the numbers were- For the amendment ... ... ... ... 47 Against it- ... ... .. ... ... 74 Maiorty ... ... ... ... -v The amendment was therefore lost, and the clause was agreed to. Clauses 4 to 23 inclusively were agreed to with verbal amendments, and the House having resumed, The C}&r:YA.N reported progress, and obtained leave to sit again. The sitting was suspended at 4 o'clock. The SPE&mR took the chair again at 6 o'clock. PETIONS.

Mr. CHBETHAM asked the President of the Board of' Control why the return ordered on the 3d of March las, relating to roads, railways, and navigable canals in Iadia, had not been laid before the Housa M. V. SMITE replied that it wag nocesary to obtaln from India some of the information to which the return referred, and, although application had been made for thatin_ formation, it had not yet been received in this country. AFFAIRS OF INDIA. Lord PALMERsTON.-i wish, inverting the ordinarycourse of proceeding, to put a question to the right hon. member for Buckinghamshirem It was arranged the other day that we shouldgive up Monday to that right hon. gentleman, with the view of enabling him to make such motionsa, he might think fit with reference to the affairs of India. 1 suggested Monday for the purpose, thinking it probablv that the Indian mail would arrive before that time. 1E find, hoWever, it is not likely that tho mail will arnive ntil Monday, and I would therefore suggest to tho, rlght hon. gentleman whether he wouldpostpone his motion, and take the earliest Government day that may suit him, which we shall very readily give up. We shall then be sure that 'the mail will arrive before the question is discused, and the whole country wi be in fall possession of whatevernews may be brought by that maiL I think itwould be for the convenience of the House that the course I suggost should be adopted. The notice of the rlght hon. gentleman can either stand, as it was originaly fixed, for Monday, or we will give up Thursday for the discussion. Of course, the. right hon. gentleman will put upon thne notice paper the' terms of the motion he intends to propose. Mr. DISRAELL-I ama very sensible of the importance. of any observations which fall from the noble lord on a subject of this nature, and they are entitled to my grave attention. The noble lord may perhaps remember that it waa at his own suggestion that the delay took place in bringing: forward this question. I do not myself anticipate that it Wi be of any importance that we should receive fraih in. telligenee before I bring forward the motion Iintend to sabmit to the Houee. I have taken the suggestion of the noble' lord, which reached me by other means, into my serious. consideration, and I hope he will not be offended at my, saying that I have a firm conviction it is for the public advantage that no delay should tako placo in discussing thir, question. I hope, therefore, that the noble lord will adhere' to the arrangement which was originally made, and I WM place on the table to-night the motion I intend to sub-nit tothe House on Monday. That motion, as I before intimated, will refer only to papers; but in bringing the subject before' Parliament I am discharging what I believe to be a publicx duty. (Hear, hear.) CONVEYANCE OF TROOPS TO INDIA. On tho question that the House at its rising adjourn to, Monday, Sir C. NAPIER said that grave doubts prevailed in the, country as to whether proper means had been adopteafor sending out reinforcements to India. The First Lord of the' Admiralty stated some time ago that the passage of a sailing vessel to India occupied on the average 130 days, but be hd, subsequently given from 90 to 100 days as the-ordinary time, for the voyage. It appeared, however, that the vessels of the PeninsularandorientalsteamNavigationComp-nymade the passage in periods varying from 64.i to 88 days. These. vessels consumed on the average 900 tons of coal ; they did, not touch at any ports on the voyage; they depended upon, their sails in favourable weather, and used steam poweronly in light winds and calms. It wxs evident that screw.. steamers possessed a great advantage over sailing ships, because, while in calms the latter must lie idle for days to. n,ther, steamersmightmake way attherate of 150 miles daily. *here was a material discrepancy in the statements of the' First Lord of the Admiralty, but the vessels to which he, referred as having made the passage in from 90 to 100 days, were no doubt clippers. If sailing ships were now Sent out, with troops, they would reach the Bay of Bengal in Oc:ober, when they would meet the north-east monsoon, and some8,0u0or10,000 men might be beating about that bay fortwo or three weeks. Be was glad to fn^d from the newspapers that six steam vessels had been tak;en up for the conveyance of troops to India. Those ships would carry 4.000men, and the cost of landing each man in India wonld be491. by the first two vessels-the Golden Fleece and the iady Jocelyn-and 43l 15s. by the other four steamers. If thechannel fleet had been properly kept up they might have transported the requisite number of troops to India without; having recourse to the employment of merchant vesels. as own opinion was that, instead of paying off the screw steamers, they should have paid off sailing ships, and they would then have had five or six steamers of the line which, would have been immediately available for the despatch of' troops. If vessels of that description had been readythey, might have acted with the promptitude displayed by Wr. Canning, and have despatched 4,000 or 5,000 men to Indin. from the camp at Aldershott within 48 bours after learning that their services weze required. The Coastguard servce, if it had been resorted to, would readily have furnished 5,000 men for manning ships or forservice in India. If the block ships in various ports had been fitted with propermasts and yards, and with the means of raising their screws, they would have been able toconvey to India at least 400 or 5CO men each. With tho view to pacify the minds of people in this country who had friends in India, he hoped the First Lord uf theAdmiralty wonld be able to give a satlsfactory answer to thefollowing questions, namely,-How many ships had sailed. for India or China, the date of sailing, their names, tonnage, how many troops they took, the number of dasstpulated for the passage, Anwlshatforfeitif the, failedtheir cost, and whetber steamers or sailing ships7 Ho; many more vessels were taken up for troops, their names an& tonnage, the number of troops each was to carry, the length, of voyage stipulated for, the forfeit for non-performance, and the cost, and whether steam or sailing vessels? If any ps of war were commissioned for carrying troops, theirnames and rate, when they would be ready, and how many troops they would carry, and whether steamers or sailing ships; what number of troops of all arms would be left ia Great Britain and Ireland? Whether steamers had been engaged to tow the vessels into the Trades, and theircost ? Sir C. WOOD said with regard to the first question or the gallant Admiral, as to how many ships had sailed for India, and other particulars, he was not in a position to. answer it, as the ships weretaken up bv the East India. Company, and not by the Admiralty. With reference to the. second question, as to howv many more vessels were taken up for troops, the vessels sent by the Governmnent were theSimoom, th eTransit, and others, thefinrst of whici, t,.nt-. regumens 700J strong, and the rest carried altogether from 4,700 to 4,800 troops. It was not intended to commission any ships of war for taking oat troops. With respect to the subject of coal, the gallant Admiril must be aware that, this was an enmergency that could not possibly have been foreseen; and nobody could have supposed that in ordinaryyears the Government would have sent out a quantity of coals beyond what would suffice for the ordinary numaber of' steamers going to India. The Government were now, as fast. as they could, sending out coals to the different stations tomeet the increased demand; but it would be bad economy and great waste if they were at all times to keep up such- a store of coals as would be required to meet every possible, emergency. (Hear, bear.) COUNTY FINANCIAL BOARDS. Mr. HUGESSEN asked whether it was the intention of' the Government to introduce a measure on the subject of' county financial boards next session. Lord PALIMERSTON said, at one time it was the intention of the Govemment to propose a measure of the cha-. racter mentioned by the hon. gentleman, but the Bill' brought in by Mr. I~iuer Gibson on the subject met with-. such great difficulty in the House. and led toDso Nuch diference of opinion with regard to the manner in which such boards should be constituted, and the Government ha& found so much dlifficualty in reconcUiig conflictin~ oinions. on the question, so as to afford a fair prospect ofI carrying. sucha ~ill tht tey hd nt ben bleto fulfi their in-. tenion Wth egad o nxt esion he was not aware, Bill.~~~~~~~~~~~~~a THB SlEBW WAR AND FOREIGN OFFICE.

TJE LIVERPOOL DOCKWORIM-.LIVERPOOL, July 23.-At the usual meeting of the Liverpool Dock Committee this afternoon, Mlr. Charles Turner presiding, the dock surveyor reported the state of the dock works up to the 24th of June and the various operations in connexion with dock repairs, alterations, improvemnents, and extension during the year ending on that day. The total expenditure for these purposes during the year has been upwards of 320,0001., of which 244,4331. 12s. od. has been upon new deckworks at Liverpool and 71,9961. 3s. lOd. for repairs, while 2,1141. 8s. 9d. has been expended on the Birkenboad docks, and 4S71. 14s. 7d. upon e Birkenhead dock warehouses. Tisu LiVERPOOL TOWyN DUFS.-Returns giving ful particulars of the Liverpool town dues have been laid before Parliament and printed, on the motion of Sir J. R. G. Graham. They supply a full history of the subject, hot It is not possible to give anything like an abstract of the paper from the nature and multiplicity of the details. y. FRtu-IE ElEMOION EXPENSES.-Mr. Everett, the election auditor for Prome, has just published the account l of the expenses of the several candidates for that borough at the recent election. The total expensts of Major the Ron. W. G. Boyle are stated at 6521. 7s. 6d., those of Lord Edward Thynne at 6161. 1s. 6d., and those of Mr. Donald Nicoll, the sitting member, at 4981. 3s. 2d. Each of the unsuccessful candidates paid much more for agency than Mr. Nicoll, but that gentleman's account for printing and advertising nearly equalled both the others put together. ScorT's " PEVEnL OF TuE PEAR".-The orio-inal manuscript, in the autograph of Sir Walter Scott, w.as sold at the rooms of Mlessrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson on Thursday last, and was knocked down after some competition for 501., being 81. more than it produced when Sir Walter's manuscripts were sold by auction in August, 1831. In the same sale were several other curious high-priced books and manuscripts, of which the following may serve for an example:-" Acuna, Nuevo Descubrimiento del Gran Rio de las Amazonas," printed at Madrid in 1641 in a small ramphlet of 52 leaves, but rigidly suppressed by the authorities for fear of its furnishing information to the Portuguese, 121. 12s.; "Beanvalet de St. Victor, Vases Grecqums et Btrusques," painted for Louis Philippe, but never del vered in consequence of the Revolution, 601.; a collecllon of etehinRs, by CalUot, 131. 15s.; "Christ's Sermon on the Mount," written by Lepelle de Bois-Gallais, and ilhl minated in the arcient ujissal style, 20t. lOs.; " Psalter," tianslated into English metre by Archbishop Parker, and puinted by John Daye in 1557, 431., being a much higher I*rice than any other copy ever sold before, Bindley's havir g brought .only 171. 17s., and Sir M. Sykes's ill.

It was originalUy known as York-house, and belonged to Cardinal Wolsey, and was first called WhitehaU when King Hen y VIIL took possession of it:- Must no more call it York-place-that is past; For,sincetbeCardinalfell, thatti:le'slost: 'Tis now the King's, and called White-ball." King Hcnr-y VIII., act iv. s. L The KiDg's Palace was seven years in building. There was a public way throngh it, with two gates, one of which was built under the direction of Holbein, at the north end of King's-street. This gate was taken down in 1759. Among his other works, Henry constructed a cockpit close by this gate : tbe gate, indeed, came to he called " Cockpit-gate." This cock-pit, after various changes settled diown into "The Treasury." Godolphin, Lord Hg Treasurer in the Teign Qaeen Anne, at three or four times a-week "at Ihe Cock-pit."

WhitehaPllale, after previous mislaps, was finally destroyed by fire January the 4th, 1697-8. The old Banqueting-house had been burnt down in 1619; he present Banqueting-house was commenced by Iaigo Jones in that same year, and was finished in 1622, at the cost, according to Mr. Cunningham, of 14,9401. 4l. ld The Admiralty was commenced in 1723.

LONDON, SATURDAY, JULY25, 1857. In the House of Lords last night, Lord GP.A.x-vmE, in reply to the Earl of DERBY and Lord MALsszsnuny, stated that, considering the peculiar circumstances of the session, it was inexpedient at present to fix a day after which no news Bills would be considered by the House. Earl FORTESCUE, in a speech of considerable lengtb, eulogized the character and achieverments of the late Lord Raglan, and wished to know whether it was the intention of the Governuent to consider the question of erecting a public monument to his memory. Lord PmA-uRnz pointed out what both Houses of Parliament and the country had already done for the memory of Lord RAoLki, in the way of public thanks, a pension to the next heir to the title, and a public monument at Constantinople to the memory of those who feU in the Crimea. At the same time, a Government was bound to be cautious in dispensing such honours as public monuiments, though in mnaking this statement he did not mean to say that the Government at some future time might not entertain the subject of erecting a monument to Lord RAGLAN. The discussion was carried on by Lord BRROUGHAM and the Earl of DERBY, in whooe hands it degenerated into a personal altercation between that noble earl and Lord PANM;URE. Lord Gn.VILLE then attempted to restore the dignity of the debate, and was followed by the Dfike of BEA.uFOrT , who accused Lord PANMURE of ill-treating the late Lord HAOL-A during his lifetime and of disparaging his memory now that he was dead. The matter was then allowed to drop. Some other business was then despatched, and their Lordships adjourned. The House of Commons at its early sitting was occupied for some time in the conside,ation of the Lunatics (Scotland) BiU as amended in the Committee and then went into Commiitteetcs dicugs the clauses of the Police (Scotland) Bill but got no t further than the 23d. In the evening, on the motion that the Elouse at its rising do adjourn until Monday, Sir C. NAP1EB. addressed a series of questions to the First Lord of the Admiralty, having reference to the transport of troops, prefacing the questions by a critical commentary upon the whole subject. Sir 0. WOOD answeredthe questions as far he was able, suggesting that the gallant Admiral should have moved for returns. Other questions were put to the Government, and under cover of the motion before the House to a certain extent debated. Lord C. PAoEIS asked whether CommodoreKEp'EL was to be recalled from his command in the Chins Sea, observing that if he should be recalled the Admiralty would commit an act of great injustice uponone of the bravest and most meritorious officers in the British navy, upon whom no blame could attach for the loss of the Raleigh frigate, which had struck upon a sunken rock not mentioned in the charts, and utterly unknown. He (Lord CLAnRNcz) understood that he was to be sacrificed to an obsolete Admiralty order. Sir G. GrEy adverted to the inconvenience attending these multifarious discussions, Sir C. WOOD, having already spoken, being precluded from answering thiu question. By an invariable rule of the service (Sir GEOnGz added) every officer in the circumshances of Commodore }sPrrrn wras subject to be tried by a Court Mfartial; the Court had not yet sat, and he protested against the HIouse of Commons being called upon to anticipate its sentence. The motion for adjournment was at length agreed to. On the order for the second reading of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill, Mr. IrENEuY moved the postponement of the order for a month. He urged the great gravity and difficulty of the subject ; that, by a false step, by taking a wrong course, a vast amount of social evil would be created; that, on the other hand, the possible inconveniences of a delay of six or mine months would be as nothing compared with the risks attending hasty legislation. He noticed the fluctuations of opinion upon some important points connected with this subject, and asked whether, at that late period of the session, it was likely that these matters could receive proper consideration in the committee, and whether it was not probable that they would be discussed in a hurried manner? He comparedathe Bill which passed the Upper House in 1854 with the present, and contended that their discordancies, and the vacillations in that House in relation to this Bill, showed, in conjunction with the report of the commission of 1853, an unsettled mind in that branch of the Legislature which bad passed the measure. These,, he thought, were grounds forasking the House to postpone until another 6ession the consideration of this B3ill, which had escited, he said, a strong feeling in the country, especially among the clergy, and must provoke a protracted discussion. Sir G. GREY observed that the course taken by Mr. HmBrMLY was not only a most unusual but a most inconvenient one. He had prevented the ATTORNZY-GEXERAu from explaining the nature of the Bill, and had discussed its details, which were for the committee. The subject had undergone repeated discussion, the House was in full possession of the materials for coming to a decision, and he thought there was sufficient time and would be a sufficient attendance for the purpose of considering the details of the measure. Mr. GLADSTONE insisted that Mr. HENr had taken a perfectly legitimate, and the most legitimate course. It was impossible to exaggerate the importance of this subject, and aU that Mr. liENisy asked was to have an opportunity for deliberation, that the House might see it waythrough its rocks and shoals. Unusual courses were adoDted upon unusual occasions; no measure of suchlimportance had ever been submitted to that Rouse on the 24th of July, and this was the first instance in which it had been caUed upon to entertain for debate the subject of the dissolution of marriage, upon whichtheclergyin particularfeltsostrongly,andwhich pierced the heart of the country. This Bill, he said, was an example of legislation entirely withoutprecedent throughout Christendom, for every country which had made marriage dissoluble had made it so upon other and wider principles than were contained in this Bill. Mr. GLADSTONE then pointed out various matters of importance, which, though not properly questions of detail, must be discussed in committee, some of which he contended demanded the utmost delicacy. while others did not belong to the Legislature. He put it to the House, then, whether, at that period of the year, it was not proper to raise the question of time, irrespective of the merits or demerits of the Bill? MIr. BoWYER supported MIr. HENLEY's motion. He adverted to the extensive and fundamental changes introduced by the Bill, which was, he said, a mischievous Bill, repugnan: to the moral feelings and religiousprinciples of the country. The SOLIcrron-GEsERAL said, the Bill contained but one great principle, the dissolubility of marriage as a part of the law of the land. That the present state of things was productive of very great evil no one doubted ; the voice of the country, he believed, was decidedly in favour of the object meditated by the Bill, and it would be a great misfortune if that object should be defeated. The conrse taken by Mlr. HENLEY, he contended, 'was neither a convenient one nor fair towards the Government, and he trusted that the House would be permitted to give its decision upon the question of the secorid reading of the Bill. Lord J. M.uSNERS observed that, assum-ing with the SOLIcIToR-GENERAL that the; e was but one principle in the Bill, that principle was all-important, and it was fair to a'k the House whether it could discuss such a Bill at the fag-end of a long session. Lord STANLEY observed that this subject had undergone much consideration, and he did not think it would be easy to offer au objection to the Bill which had not been already considered in another place. The reasoa why he pressed Her Maje3ty's INlinisters to persevere in this measure was that it was essentiallv one of principle rather than of detaiL The question at issue was whether by the law of the land marriage was dissoluble or not. The great mass of opposition to the Bill turned upon the clause which placed a compulsion upon the clergy; but this was a matter of detail. Mr. NTSPIER said he had not been able to ascertain the opinion of one of his constituents regarding this Bill, but he indicated some of the dissurbing effects which the measure might have in lrelaud As the days of the session, according to the FIRST BllINxIsTR were numbered, in order to get a goods safe Bill, he supported Air. IHENLEY'S motion. The ArTOsyry - GENERAL inferred from the speeches of MIr. HENLEY and Mr. GLADSTONE that they at least could not want more time to consider the Bill. The motion ho treated as an attempt to put off a measture which had been called for year after year, and which had come down froma the other House as the result of their deliberate conclusion. This wvas one of the most importatnt measures of the session, and there was abundant time to discuss it. Upon the second reading every part of the Bill would be fully considered; it embodied nothing but what was known to have been the law of Eugland for 200 years. t ,- . MALrS denied that there was abundant time to discuxss this measure, which affected the interests of every family in the kingdom, and which ought not to be pressed llpon the House at that period of the session, when it had been already overworked. Lord PARLTERSTON said the proceeding which bad taken place that night was most extraorclinary; it was a departure from the ordinary practice of the House, and unconrteous towards those who had charge of the Bill. He denied that there was any reason for delay, or that the Bill w as new either to the House or the country. The motion was a mere pretence to conceal opposition to. the measure, and the masking this opposition under a call for delay proved that the opponents of the Bill knew that the opinion of the country 'ws against them. He would not enter into the meri rs of the measure,-a measure deeply affectinz the interests of the country,-but he aisked the House to hear the grounds upon -which it was proposed. Upon a division MIr. HENLEY'S motion was nega- tivedlby 217 to 130. On the motion of Lord PAL-NMRSTON the order for the second reading of the Bill was fixel to ba the first on Thursday next. The Homse then went into commit-e on the Ilicit flis1lltiou (Ireland) Bill, but, wbswu a fexw
The line taken by Mr. HENLEY in opposing the Mivorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill is one that Emight be repeated with equal propriety every 'Session and every week of every Session for the next nive hundred years. No doubt, too, if Mr. HENLEY -could live as long, or if there could be a succession of his likes, they would always warn the House .against the danger of a false step, and urge further -consideration. Indeed, if we are to adopt Mr. RENLrY's principle, that where there have been fluctuations of opinion there can be no decision, and that there must be a long unanimity to justify -a change, then Parliament certainly has no choice but to do nothing at all. The headlong precipitancy of legislation which the Member for Oxfordshire so gravely deprecates consists in the very natural project of doing once for aU and in a regular -constitutional manner what Parliament has done, we forget how many hundred times, for nearly two centuries, in the most irregular and unconstitutional manner. Every principle of the present measure may -appeal to a Parliamentary prescription in its favour larger, fuller, and steadier than could have been pleaded for any considerable change in modern times. Every year, indeed, Parliament has done for some cases what it is now called on to do for aU similar cases. Several times every year, during the present reign, for example, Her Majesty Queen VICTORIA, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the faithful Commons, have Instituted a close and generally indecent inquiry into the secret movements and the private habits of one lfrs. SO-AND-So and one Mr. TuiS or TIHAT; and, by the way, of the lady's husband, the particulars -being such that, if they were not judicial facts, the publication of them would expose the publisher to fine and imprisonment. After being dragged through -all this dirt three or four times every year, to the inunense cost of the suitors and to the great injury of public morals, HELI MAJESTY, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the faithful Comanons have usually ended by pronouncing Mr. and Mrs. SO-AND-SO to be no longer husband and wife, and permitting them to marry anybody they pleased. Inideed, owing to the persevering but uniformly unsuccessful scruples of certain Bishops -and Lay Peers, Parliament has always specially and emphatically asserted the right of the adulterer to marry the adulteress, leaving the Church of Eng'land to do as it pleased in the matter. All this has been done ad nausean. It has been more regularly done than anything else in this country that we can remember. Other things come in and go out. There are subjects that figured promi-nently in the A>u&>azl .cgister of sixty or eighty years ago that no longer appear, and many of our mnodern topics would startle us if we found them so far back. But, as sure as winter and summer *have succeeded one another, there have bcen the sessional Bills for the Dissolution of Marriage, always embodying the same principles. It is the attempt to get rid of this long and hatefuil task, and to resign it to a properly qualified and constistutional tribunal, that Ml. HENLEY calls "hasty legislation." No doubt, this is a very convenient line to take -up on the 24th day of a very warni July. The four weeks that remain of the Sessioni must be -considered a very short time for doing what the House has done hundreds of times before in a quarter of an hour. It has never taken more than five minutes to pars a private Bill for the dissolution of a marriage after the report of the Coni-nittee oil the facts of the case, and every such -BiUl has involved the same principles as that before the House. So, -when iMr. HIENLEY implores the House not to be in a " hurry," when he alleges the mnsettled state of the Upper House, which was never more settled than on this Bill, and when he refers to clerical excitement, it is manifest that the hurry, the unsettlement, and the agitation, are simply political fictions. A month is quite time enough. The majority of the Lords are quite settled, as they always have been. The clergy have taken -quietly some hundred such Bills before, without -even a protest, though any one of them might have been caUed upon to marry the guilty pair. The House of Commons has never yet asked for twelve mouths or six montlhs to consider a question of whiclh MIr. GLADSTONE says it is impossible to exaggerate the importance. They have not even considered the question at all, but given at once the very answer given in this Bill. Indeed, as Mr. GLADSToN)E correctly observes, it has never -yet entertained for debate the subject of the Dissolution of Marriage--all-important as the subject may be-for the simple reason that in the most ftagitious and abandoned wray, as MIr. GLADISTMNE must feel, the House has invariably settled the matter withotut debate at all, and dissolvecd marriages as readily and inconcernedly as it would a joint-stock company, or any institution -that had co-ased to answer its purpose. It is not for us to say where this gentleman's wits are wander.in lvhen he describes the Bill as an example of legisl.tion entirely without precedent. We know not wlhat ages, what countries, have chained his attentiou, and wlhere he looks for precedents; but if 'we may venture to recall him to so vulgar a region and so unblessed a soil as that whereon he stood, when be uttered these words, we beg to remind him of several hundred good English precedents exactly to the purpose; the very thing, in fact the only dlifference being, that on all these occasions the H-ouse of Commons did not even think it 'vorth while to discuss the quiestion, but did the very thing objected to without a moment's hesitation. The clergy, of whom about five thousand have signed a documient pronouncing marriage indissoluble by the Word of Gon, are very properly appeale(d to by Mr. GLADSTONE, as models of calm and patient deliberation. WVe can credit ani amount of zeal and hard work in that useful and healthy body of men, particularly in the present mncomnionly open -weather. They can walk, ride, or drive with the thermometer at 75 even better than a unlioni surgeon. They are exceedingly fearless in sgning prUlests, at least those which do not bind lth-in to anything. There is one thing, howe -er, which they either cannot or will not do--it's such very dull wvork. They will not give half an hour's consideration to the meaning of a passage of Scripture. Ve beg to assure our less learned readers that this is not a quostion for scholars or divines. The passages in the Gospels bearing on the Dissolubility of Marria:ge are faithftlly rendered in the English version, and anybody who can read theni -through and bear in mind the beginning of a sentenco till he gets to the end is capable of forming a judgment on this question. For -our part, we cannot conceive any reasonable being donbting that the passages refer exclusively to a particular piece of immorality then prevalent among the Jews, and justifying itself by a passage in the Mosaic law. This was the practice of wanton, causeless, capricious divorce or repudiation whenever a husband got tired of his wife, or 'wanted another, or wished to oblige a dissolute friend. In this case he alleged some defect in his wife's health, or temper, or habits, or condition, and, signing a writ of repud:ation, got rid of her, and put it in her power to marry somebody else. This practice is very properly arnd very strongly con- demned, as being only a legal sort of adidi2erY, involving all parties in that crime. It is expressly stated that the condemnation does nOt apply to the case where the conduct of the wife really justifies repudiation. Whether that wife, Bo guilty and so repudiated, might marry anybody in general, or her paramour in particular, is altogether another question, and one on which the New Testament is wholly silent. We have to decide it, as we have to decide many other questions, by the best lights in our power; and the tender, merciful, and forgiving character of the Gospel justifies us in mending such a sore as the breach of a marriage contract in the readiest way in our power. No doubt, the highest feeling will suggest that the guilty persons should renounce aU chance of connubial bappiness, and take the rank of penitents, with no otber consolation than the sense of forgiveness. But the Gospel was not given us for the highest feelings only. At aU events, it inculcates mercy to men and women of ordinary feelings. It also inculcates common sense. We feel sure, then, that we obey its dictates by pronouncing a marriage dissolved in a case where under the old law the woman would be punished with death, and giving her the next best chance of restoration to comparative honour and virtue, by allowing a legal union with the new object of her affections. That, indeed, has been the feeling of the British Legislature for near two hindred years; and the "heart of the country," cited by M:r. GLADSTONE, has never yet confessed a woumd at the recurrence of these merciful acts. It is still the feeling of the House, and Mr. HENLEY'S extraordinary attempt to get rid of the Bill withont even a discussion of its merits has been baffled by a majority which leaves no doubt of the success of the measure.
The Ecclesiastical Commission is not a popular body, but many years must elapse before its functions become obsolete. From the moment at which, under the auspices of Sir ROBERT FEEL, Parliament began to regulate the disposition of Church property, it became impossible to revert to the ancient reverence for the irresponsible rights of corporate ownership. In former times little distinction was made between succession and inheritance. The lay fee, as well as the spiritual benefice, while it was inalienable, involved the burden of discharging definite duties. Even within living recollection a pluralist was regarded nearly in the same light as a landed absentee. In the eye of the law the parson is a freeholder in respect of his living. Bishops and Deans and Chapters, excepting for the restraints imposed by modern legislation, possess all the attributes of landed proprietors ; but in this case, as in all others, prescription once intermpted can never be resumed. The primary object of the statesmen who instituted the Ecclesiastical Commission was to correct the grosser inequalities which prevailed in the distribution of Church property. The abolition of sinecures, the reduction of enormous incomes, and the occasional augmentation of small livings, were measures which commanded general assent. A portion of the clergy instinctively apprehended the tendency of external interference to disturb the inviolable character of their tenure ; but the practical security afforded to the establishment by the removal of many glaring abuses might fairly be set off against a danger which was theoretical, and probably remote. The changes vhich have sinct been effected have not been so extensive or violent as to justify any extravagant alarm. It soon appeared that many other consequences followed from the creation of an official body of trustees for the Church. The great estates which fell partially iuder the control of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners admitted not only of a more equitable rule in the distribution of their proceeds, but also of large increase from a different system of management. The effects of transitory ownership as compared with hereditarypossessionwere never more curiously illustrated than in the condition of Church property, and especially of the Episcopal endowments. Laxity, selfishness, liberality, and caprice had not infrequently been combined with some of the grossest forms of corruption. Bishops had in a fewv instances plundered their sees ; in many cases they had allowed therm to be plundered. It seldom happened that the patdimony of the diocess had been prudently and honestly administered for three successive incumbencies. A life tenant with a stranger for remainderman is likely to anticipate the income of the property, if possible, and he is almost certain at best to neglect the interests of his successor. The law and custom of Church estates had provided every facility for the exercise of whatever amount of carelessness or of cupidity might distinguish successive prelates. The system of leases on lives granted for a small quitrent, in consideration of a pecuniary fine, seems to have been contrived for the purpose of separating the interests of the incumbent from those of the Church which he represented. If an exceptionally conscientious Bishop bad allowed a lease to approach its term of expiration, his successor rejoiced in the opportunity of selling an interest in the property which bore a large proportion to the value of the fee. One admirable prelate, who half a century ago carned a deserved reputation for sagacity even among the class to which he belonged, carried the process one step further. After granting to his own son a lease for three lives of a considerable estate at a nominal rent, the Bishop promoted a private Bill in Parliament for the sale of ths reversion. It was evident, as he urged, that an expectancy at the end of sixty or seventy years was comparatively valueless to the see ; but a purchaser might nevertheless be willing to take the reversion at a price sufficient to make a perceptible increase of the Episcopal income. In the good old times Parliament was not inclined to examine too closely into the private allairs of a member of the House of Lords who voted -with Government. The Bill was passed, the Bishop bought the reversion, and received for life the interest of the purchase-money. The estate passed without remark from the Church into a private family, and, as the acquitted prisoner at the Old Bailey said of the gown which she had stolen, " now it was hone.stly their own." Such was the habitual course of dealing with Episcopal endowments that it is really difficult to fix upon the exact point at which the robbery was completed. UInder the system of fines and quitrents a large body of Church leaseholders had naturally grown up. The old proverb, " Unier dem Stabe ist gut " wolmnen," was in one sense true in modern England, for the tenants who lived under the crozier had by-custom converted their holdings into an inheritance. It was always the interest of the landlord to renew, that he might anticipate his successor. It was not less advantageous to the Icssee to profit by the condition of the incumbent. Dying Bishops were generally found to be more than ordinarily unscrupulous under the infiluence of anxious relatives ; and when the vendor is in a hurry to grant a cheap bargain the purchaser naturally profits by the occasion, and perhaps insists on still more favourable terms. Blut, whatever might be the origin of their rights, Church lessees were entitled to claim the protection which belongs to all existing property. Their lands were, and still are, bought and sold as readily as freeholds, subject to the burden of fines and of quitrents, but with Qnly a trifling diminution of value on account of the nominal uncertainty- of tenure. Lay holders of Ohurch pi6jMrty were naturally alarmed by the estiblishment of a nermanect body o disinterest.d Commissioners. The'r property had been created by the conflict of interests 7*tween Church 'uen and the Church, and they feared that the estates which had been carved out of diocesa endovwments might revert to the original owvner. Several measures have been proposed for regulating the interests of the lessees, and the Bill which was discussed in the House of Commons on Thursday night contains a series of provisions for the enfranchisement of leaseholds. The abuses of pat times must be accepted as existing facts, but it is highly necessary rbat precautions should be taken against the revival of a similar system. I It is proposed once more to assign landed estates to the different Bishops, instead of giving them fixed incomes secured on the property which is vested in the Ecclesiastical Commission. It is not surprising tbat the Prelates themselves should prefer an arrangement which renders them coraparatively independent of Parliamentary interference; but the recent policy of assigning them fixed and equal revenues is scarcely compatible with the possession of endowments in land, and the inconveniences of transitory proprietorship wi}l be felt, notwithstanding any attempt to guard against the recurrence of former practices. If Bishops are deterred by law and public opinion from fleecing their successors, they cannot be expected to sacrifice their own interests for the future benefit of the see. A life-tenant cannot afford to improve, and a modern Bishop seldom possesses any disposable capital. There are no livings so undesirable as those in v:hich tithes have been commuted for land. The parson can neither farm with advantage himself, nor provide the outlay which may be necessary to procure a desirable tenant. On a large scale, if not to the same extent, similar disadvantages attach to a landed Bishop; and the difficulty is increased when the property is of such a nature that the returns are not annual and uniform. The new Bill contains provisions against the misappropriation of minerals belonging to the Church, but all legislation -which restricts the free disposal of property is at best a necessary evil. A landowner who cannot be trusted to make the best. use of his land is an encumbrance to the neighbourhood. If security of tenure is necessary to agricultural occupiers, it is stiUl more indispensable to landlords. There are undoubtedly objections to the possession of great estates by a public Board, but for the present the continuance of the Ecclesiastical Commission is less objectionable than the reinstatement of Bishops in their former position.
In the last number of the Journal periodically issued by the Statistical Society of London will be found an article replete with interest for many classes of readers. The subject, which is "The " Pay of3 Ministers of the OttowNi," may, perhaps, threaten some lack both of scope and liveliness, not to mention the highly professional manner in which it is handled by the author of the paper, Dr. WTIhUATI FARR; but we shall venture to discard the algebraical and logarithmic computations by which the results in question have been obtained, and we undertaLe to say that the substance of the essay will bear out cur testimony to its attractions. Dr. FAUR'S purpose is, first, to establish the actual value of Ministerial salaries; next, to ascertain their relative value when compared with the acquisitions attainablq in other pursuits ; and, finally, to offer suggestions based on the conclusions arrived at. One of these inquiries, at any rate, may appear to the general reader to admit of a very easy settlement, but such is by no means the case. Certainly wve know well enough, not only from the Estimates, but from most almanacks pretending to comprehensive utility, that the rate of salary in the higher offices under the Cxowx is about 5,0001., and in the lower offices about 2,0001. per annum, but this is only the first step in the calculation. At what time of his life does a public man obtain these offices, how long does he hold tbem, and what expense does he incur in fighting his way to them? Of the methods adopted in excavating these facts we need only say that the data in the second of the cases mentioned are considered under the form of " two curves ;" and that " the numbers that express the area of " the space between the first and the last ordi"nates, the curve, and the abscission, express also "the time which was enjoyed by the MEnistries." Trusting that this view of the process employed niay produce a due impression, we now pat the results in popular language, by saying that the average value of the Premiership-taken as a type of official salaries-is equivalent to a life annuity of 3381. commencing at the age of 21. Generally speaking, however, a statesman has filled subordinate offlces and received subordinate salaries before reaching the summit of the public tree, and these receipts therefore have to be included in the general computation. As a final deduction Dr. FARR discovers-no doubt with infinite exactitude-that the sum total of pecuniary satisfaction enjoyed by the most successful politicians from first to last " does not exceed in " pecuniary value a life annuity of 7151.," commencing as above. Here, then, is one of the facts we are in search of, and now for the next. WVbhat are the profits of professional men enjoying among their own brethren distinctions corresponding to those attaching to Ministers of the CROWvN among Doliticians generally ? The incomes of 24 Barristersrangefrom 5,0001. to 20,G001. a-year; of 24 Judges from 4,8001. to 8,0001. It is a remarkable fact that the profits of another learned profession-that of physicappear of late years to have declined. They were greater in the first half of the century than at present. Whether they are now distributed over a larger surface, or whether, as is perhaps possible, the whole divisible sum has been diminished by the improved habits, and conse(iuently the better health, of society, we cannot pretend to decide, but it seems clear that, in some way or other, the subsidence has occurred. Not, indeed, that there is much to complain of in this respect even now, for " a very " high authority " doubted whether the number of physicians and surgeons in the metropolis enjoying incomes of 5,0001. a-year did not approach pretQy nearly to 20; but the gains are notthose of old days. However, whereas the professions generally do this much for thwir votaries, the receipts of 24 Ministers, instead of ranging from 5,0001. to 20,0001., or from 4,800!. to 8,0001., range only from 2,0001. to 5,0001. True it is that Mi\inisters possess pa'ronage, but In the Committee on Official Salaries it was prudently observed, that if this patronage were to be regarded as compenhation for defective salaries, a MIinister would be at once provided with a justification for dealing with it as he pleased. We arrive, then, witbout any difficulty at the conclusion that the pay of Ministers of the CROWN, measured by that standard which Dr. FIARR selects asthe fitting one, and estimated by the conditions of its tenure, is considerably below the mark. That it is far below the scale prevailing a century and a half ago, while the duties of office and the receipts of all other classes have been largely on the rise, we need not Btop to observe; but Dr. FARR takes a step in advance still, and argues, upon the authority furnished by actual experience, that, excepting in cases where private fortunes supply the gap, it is insufficient to cover the demands which the office creates. The *' frightful example" l in this matter is, of cour,e, the second WILLIAM PITT, who, though he entered office early, was principal 31inister for 20 y4T1s) 'and drew during that time an official income "metimes of more than 11,0001., and always of morit than 7,0001., died in overwhelming embarrassment. Naturally, therefore, we are asked what, but fort the aids of private property, must be the :position of Mr. EI'T's successors with only half his sah%zy, and how, after all the foregoing arguments, the zountry can expect to get the right men for the right places, or the best men for all? Is it reasonable to calculate that the highest and most important pursuit of all pursuits-that of politics-wil command the services of the best men when the prospects are only such as have been described? Yet nothing can be plainer than that tbe truest of all economy must consist in getting the most highly qualified candidates for appointments on which the prosperity and opulence of the whole Empire may depend, and especially, as Dr. FARx remarks, at a period when the general level of political knowledge has been materially raised. As a practical recommendation, therefore, it is suggested that by a modification of the Superzannuation Act 80 or' 100 of the working political men in the Legisrtlure, Mlinisters and ex-M.inisters being included, should enjoy either half-pay or'salaries regulated by the emoluments of such offlicials as the Attorney-General, the SolicitorGeneral, or the Judges. A careful consideration of this elaborate argument has induced us to conclude that the learned writer's reasonineg is sound in so far as it proves the low remuneration of public men, and that his suggestion is in conformity with abstract justice when he pleads for an increase of liberality in tbis direction, bu't that, as a matter of fact, the proposed reform could hardly be expected to affect the actual state of things in any perceptible degree. " For better pay," it is said, " the " country would get better work." We cannot but doubt it. That this pay, as estimated and measured in the article under review, is smXall, we readily acknowledge; but if it is implied that the fact deters from public life any men or class of men who would otherwise enter it, to the advantage of the country, we are compelled to dissent. We believe that all the highest talent is attracted to the Legislature as it is, and that the State does really get the benefit of it, though on terms perhaps unjustly low. Dr. FARiR himself is fain to admit that "this country is now happy "in its SOVEREIGN; happy in its SenPte, "which never contained a greater number "of men in various ways eminent, and 'happy also in the possession of a great body " of political men." Hle acknowledges likewise that no English Minister has of late times been either accused or even seriously suspected of any species of corruption ; and, after such confessions, we may surely ask where the room for improvement canlie. No doubtthe career opened tb this bcdy of politicians is a " precarious" one; no doubt a measure for ameliorating its prospects might be supported on grounds of justice; but we do not think the practical result wonld involve much change in the administration of affairs. If the " modification of a clause in the " Superannuation Act" would indeed so elevate tbe qualifications of public servants generally as to insure the greatest success and the greatest economy in the operations of the State, nobody can question the excellence of the bargain or the expediency of striking it at the earliest moment; but we doubt the fact. A different kind of argument arises from the alle-ed positive insufficiency of the salaries in high office; but here again the fa'ious example of Mr. PITT is but a weak one. We should like to know what amount of income -would 'havo, 'kept a man cle*d whose " ordinary " resource for getting rid of his coaclimaker's " importunities was ordering a new carriage," andwho, withsomepatrimony, 9,0001. or 10,0001. a-year from his appointments, simple habits, inexpensive tastes, and no wife or family, yet died 40,0001. in debt at the age of 47 ? There are men whom no conceivable possessions can save from embarrassment, and PITT mwas one of them. Nevertheless, the fact that gond service is got for poor pay is not a conclusive argument against mak;ing the pay better; and, if we cons;der that the pay of the members of both Houses of Parliament now in office is under 150,0001. a-year, while the pay of the two Houses if salaried at the same rate as the American Congress would be over 1,000,0001. a-year, it may be thought, perhaps, that a step made in the proposed direction would be neither exsravagant nor impolitic.

TEE DESPFATCH OF i °OPEAN T-Roop, I TO INDIA, Yelef,day was published a copy of some iery iLmportant coirespondence which has passed since tbe 1st of April, 2856, between the Court of Directors of the East Indi Company and the Board of Control, and between thb said Court and the GovernorGeneral of India in Council, relating to the number ol Eutopean troops i India, The return wAs moved fo by Mr. Semo8Lr - M-P., and ordered by the House of Common to be printed on the 20th ins, The p opens with a letter from the GoverrGeneral of India to the Directors of the Court in Leaden>ll-Street (dated the 5th of April, 18M), informing *h,'m of the great pressure for officers for dcetaehed i cml,l ent in India, and of the consequent 3ueessity *h.2t was felt by the Indian Government ofvrti.ngthe.Ho,- Court of Directors to supply the ex'isting vacan.'es. of ensigns in the fixed estabhshmcnt of regiiments, snd 10 appoint supernumerary cadets of infantry to t.Oe Bengal establishment to the extent of two for eacL regiment, or for the three Enropean regiments 12, and for the 74 N5ative Infantry regimients 148, making in all 160 eadets. The Directors, in their reply (September 11O; admitted the urgency of the want, and were vriling to send supernimerary cadets as an immediatermeasure of relief; but they observed tha the mere appointment of one or more ofticerstothe rank of ensignswould not be the remedy required to meet efiectually the present (September, 1856) exigencies of the Indian army. They eorroborated this their opinion by. a reference to the dictum of the lats Sir C. J. Napier. In the present state of the finances the Court of Directors could only (they said) sanction the appointment of one additional captain and one additional liuntenant to every regiment of INative Infantry and Cavalhy of the regular formatiesa in the three Presidencies, and of two additional captains and two lieutenants to each European regiment. The Directors opined; moreover, that the native regiments of the line should always have present with them for regimental duty in time of peace 1 for command, 10 eligible for command of companies, and 2 eligible for regimental staff, besides the young ensigns training for their cuties; and that in time of war every available officer detached from the regiment for staff employment should forthwith rejoin it. It will be seen from these papers that as early as 15 months ago an urgent representation was made by the Government of India of the paucity of European officers in that empir6. Then follows some correspondence about the transmission to India of relief regiments. An important minute of the GovernorGeneral of India in Council, dated the 7th of February. 1857, refers to the current Persian expedition, which would require a large force of European troops, and his Exesllency asks the pertinent question, " Whence are these regiments to be drawn, and what reserve will remain available for further draughts after they have been taken?" The GovernorGeneral goes on to show that the whole force must be supplied from Bengal. "The Earopean strength of the Indian army," he continues, " reduced by the withholding of two regiments of Queen's Infantry, on account of the exigencies of the Russian war, has not been made good." . "1 The army of India is not established upon a scale calculated to meet the drain of a war carried on at a distance of 2,000 miles from its shores, least of all its European force, which does not admit of ready increase." The Governor-General objected, therefore, to the withdrawal of more than a certain force of European troops from Bengal, and he requested Her MIajesty's Government at home to despatch the, four regiments already announced for embarcation in the summer of 1857-three to Bombay and one to Madras-not two to Madras and two to Kurrachee, as desired bytheCommander.in-Chief. He also requested the sending out of three more regiments to Bombay (two months later), and desired that the 10th and 29th R-giments might be retained by the Indian Government. This minuite of Lord Canning was endorsed with a full approval by DIr. Dorin, the senior member of the Council, who expressed his entire concurrence in the expediency of demanding large reinforcementss from England of European troops, and intiLmated his k3nowledge of the fact that the exGovernor-Generalof rndia(the Marquisof Dalhousie) was of opinion that "he had reduced the European force iu India to the lowest possible limit justified by ordinary prudence-`It -was proposed by the 3irectors of the C6mpaTjikf6fthe lndia Board last April to make arrangements for restoring the Queen's regiments of Eltropean infantry on the establishment of India to thbe number of 24-the number maintained since the year1.842. In May last it was deemed expedient to send out four regiments to Iudia without delay, making with the 2d and 3d Dragoons, already ordered out, a force of six regiments. On the 29th of June the Directors of the Company, considerinsg the critical state of affairs in India, applied to the India Board for the despateh of four additional regiments of infantry of 1,l000 each beyond the force ordered to proceed this season, and on the 1st of July inst. the Court was ap, rized of the Qneen's permission for the embarcat,on of the 1st Il'oot (Ist battalion), and the 19th, 38th, and 79th Foot, and her command that the draughts of the 9th and 14th Dragoons and the 10th and 29th Infantry should join their head-quarters in India. Orders were also given to hold a regiment in readiness to embark from the Cape of Good Hope. On the 14th of July inst. the Court of Directors, alarmed by the news of the further defection of Sepoys, applied to the India Board for an additional force of Ism regiments of infantry to be despatched to India forthwith, and the Court opined that it was also desirable to strengthen the artillery force of the several governments by the despatch of eight companies. The Horse Guards accordingly ordered out the 42d, 20th, 54th, 34th, and 97th Foot, and the 2d Battalion Rifle Brigade, together with two troops of Horse Artillery and six companies of Royal Artillery.

ACCIDEN-T CAUSEs BY A RAT.-Edwin Dispe, a gentleman's coachman, in IUlontagn-street, Montagsssquare, in taking his horses into the stable inet with great opposition from the animals, which was very unnsual, as they possessed no vicious propensities. The coachman, in erdeavouring to bring one of the horses up to the trough to eat its food, discovered a large rat, which it appears had turned upon them everv time they attempted to approach the trough to take their provender, which occasioned their fright and reluctance to eat. On maling the discovery Dupe endeavonred to kill the rat, which sprang over his head on the back of the horse, and so alarmed the animal that e plunged violently, and, rearing npon his hind legs, lknocksed tho coachman down, breahing his jawv to pieces. The poor sufferer was taken to the hospital and attended to by Mr. lRooper, the house surgeon, but the injuries were so severe that he died shortl after.

SECOND EDITION. THB TIMEBSOFFICE, Saturda'y Morning. INDIA. (FROM OUR MALTA CORRESPOND7? i- MAThA, JuLY 19. Her Majesty's despatch steamer Caradoc, bearer of a telegraphic despatch from London, sid Turin, for India, arrived here on the 16th inst. from Cagliari, and left again for Alexandria on the ifternoon of the same day. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steampacket Vectis, with the overland London mail, arrived from Marseilles on the evening of the 16bh inst., bringing, among other passengers, for Alexandria, Lieutenant-Oxeneral Sir Colin Campbell, en rozute for India ; Major Alison, Military Secretary; Captain Sir D. Baird, 98th; Aide-de-Camp Lieutenant Alison; Aide-de-Camp Major-General vana Straubenzee, en routefor China ; and other officers. The Vectis left for Alexandria early on the morning of the 17th, preceded by a few hours by the Colombo steam packet, belonging to the same company, carrying the heavy Indian mails and passengers, after a stay of 4i days, awaiting the arrival of the Vectis with the overland maiL EXPRESS FROM PARIS: The following is the letter of our Paris correuspondent, dated yesterday (Friday), 6 p.m.:- Private letters from Madrid of tho 20th contain the satisfactory intelligence that theSpanish Governmnent has, after[hesitating a good deal, accepted the offer of mediation in the Mexican question made by Lord Howden and the IMarquis Turgot in the name of their respective Governments. M. Lafragua, the Mexican Envoy, is about to place in the hands of the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs a narrative of the whole of his negotiations, which he intends afterwards1publishing in Paris. A person of the name of Losada, a Guatemalan by birth, and commissioned by Santa Anna to treat with the Spanish Government, has arrived in Madrid. It is supposed that the communications with this agent delayedcthe answer of the Spanish Minister to the offer made by Lord Howden and his colleague, the acceptanca, if wbat was currently reported in Madrid be true, being couched in rather ambiguous and not over gracious terms. It is also stated t-at the Spanish Government was informed in very plain and unmistakable terms, that if the mediation was rejected Spain must not count on any assistance from either England or France, whatever untoward circum. ,tances might arise to her out of a war with Mexico. This intimation, perhaps, hurt the susceptibility of the Spanish Government, but fear has been even stronger than pride, and the mediation has been accepted, as I have just mentioned, after much hesitation and difficulty; so at least my letters state as the news of the day. The British and French Ministers have carried out the desire of their respective Governments, and acted throughout this affair in the same spirit. Lord Howden, whose health had been suffering much, was about to leave Madrid during the great heat, which is stated to have been for several days at 32 Reaumur, or above 100 of Fahrenheit. Accounts from Toulon, of the 22d inst., mention that the English fleet which anchored in that port on Sunday last, under the command of Admiral lord Lyons, is composed of the Admirars flag-ship Royal Albert, the ships-of-the-line Conqueror and Centurion, corvettes Cyclops and Ariel, and the gun-boats Vigilant, Osprey, and WVanderer. The usual salutes were exchanged between the British ships and the batteries of the Grosse-Tour, which fired at the same3time with the French ship-of-theline Eylau. At 6 o'clock in the evening Lord Cowley, the British Ambassador, arrived at Toulon, and was saluted by the guns of the Royal Albert as he went on board. The commissioners appointed to report on the expediency of converting New Caledonia into a penal settlement have concluded their labours. They are unanimous in declaring that New Caledonia is well suited for that purpose. It is believed that the Emperor, on his return to Paris, will issue a decree in conformity with the opinion of the commissioners. A medal is about to be struck at the Mint in Paris to commemorate the submission of the Kabylian tribes. Advices from Algiers of the 21st inst. announce that Marshal Randon had arrived there on the 18th, and was received on landing with much enthusiasm. On the 15th the Marshal raised his canip at Ternesguida, and proceeded to Fort Napoleon. He inspected the works on the 16th, and left on the 17th with his personal staff, but without escort, for Deliys. The road which throws open the approaches to the mountains of Kabylia is now finished. It is affirmed that not a single tribe remains unsubjected. The troops under the command of Generals M'Mahon, Yussuf, and Maissiat, were returning to their respective garrisons. The first division, under General Renault, remained in Kabylia, in order to complete the works commenced at Fort Napoleon, or on the roads; the conquest of Kabylia is considered as final. Advices from Odessa of the 10th mention that, pursuant to instructions sent from St. Petersburg to Count Strogonoff, Governor-General of Southern Russia and Besserabia, the difficulties respecting the expulsion of several foreign families at Sebastopol had been settled. I have already mentioned that the Emperor of Russia had sent a number of decorations to be distributed among the persons with whom the Grand Duke Constantine was in communication during his recent visit to France. In the navy, Vice-Admiral Trehouart, Commander of the Squadron of Evolutions; Vice-Admiral La Place, Maritime Prefect at Brest; and Vice-Admiral Montagnies de la Roque, Mlaritime Prefect of Rochefort, have received the decoration of St. Anne of the first-class; and 18 other naval or civil officers have obtained decorations in that order, or in that of St. Stanislas. The Emperor the day before yesterday, at 10 in the morning, laid the first stone of a new building for baths at Plombieres, in presence of the municipal council, the clergy, and a large concourse of persons belonging to the town and neighbourhood. The cure of Plombieres delivered an address to His Majesty on the occasion, in which he said that the building about to be erected, and which would take the name of the Baths and Hotel Napoleon, would form a lasting monument of the solicitude of His Majesty for the prosperity of Plombieres. He then alluded to the well-known partiality of the Empress Josephine for the place, and concluded his address as follows:- "May the Almighty, in His goodness, bless the stone which your majesty is about to lay, and may He, at the same time, consolidate your power, which has given to our country the tranquillity it now enjoys; may He more par. ticulary blesa the health of your Majesty, who is so dear to us all, and may the virtue of our waters strengthen it for the security and happiness of France."' The Emperor replied as follows " I am happy to satisfy your wish of eeeingmelaythe f& stone of the new bathing establishment, which, I am cen. vinced, will contribute to the prosperity of Plombires This place Interests me, not only because so many persona have here recovered their health, but because it is the centre of a population who have given mo so many touching proofs of their affection, and who have been always animated by true patriotism. I hope that all those who, like me, come here to take repose from their labours, may find renevOw strength for the accomplishment of their duties, and for the pervico of the county, It is for me a aus ot singqa re- giet that I cannot, during my stay here, ailso lay the firat stone of another and more Important monument-that ol the new church; for when any person has found an allevation of his sufferings, it is proper for every Christian soul to testify his gratitude to Providence. In fact, if what is evil comes from men, all that is good comes from God." The conclusion of his Majesty's speech was the signal for loud cries ofl" Vive i'Rmpereur !" In the afternoon the,Emperor left Plombi6res for Varigney (Haute-Sa6ne), about five miles beyond St. Loup, to visit the foundry of M. Patret. He was welcomed by cheers from the numerous workmen employed there. Several large pieces of iron intended for railway works were cast in presence of the Emperor, who afterwards visited in detail the whole of the works, with which he repeatedly ex. pressed his satisfaction to M. Ricod, the director of the works, and the son-in-law of M. Patret. His Majesty on quitting the place left a handsome gratuity for the workmen, and returned to Plombibres at 7 o'clock. At nine there was a ball at the Imperial residence. The Emperor will not return to Paris before Monday or Tuesday next. The Section of Agriculture and Commerce of the Council of State has voted unanimously in favour of the suppression of the butchers' monopoly. The Paris police have received orders to be more active in the discovery and seizure of obscene books and prints, which have lately increased. A petition to the Senate is in course of signature, praying for considerable alteration in the law on hbel, with a view to increased severity. The directors of the Bank of France have announced that the interest on sums advanced on public securities is in future reduced from 6 to 5k per cent. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- " TRIESTE, JULY 23. "Advices have arrived from Constantinople to the 16th Isshan Boy has been named Minister of Turkey at Barlin. A note from the Porte to thoPowers in favour of the union of the Principalities explains the impossibility which the Ottoman Government finds to apply to Moldavia the exceptions set forth for Wallachia in the firman of convocation."

Seven Royal carriages conveyed the illustrious party to the Palace, where they were received by His Majesty the King with the customary formalities. The Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg have arrived at Brussels, and are now staying at the Palace. His Royal Highness the Prince Consort is expected to arrive at Antwerp, on board the Victoria and Albert, on Monday morning I next, the day of the ceremony.

THE DANUBIAN PRINCIPALITIES. (FROM OUB OWN COoBBSRPONDENT.) JASSY, JULY 15. For several years the public of England has been so sumptuously treated to Eastern politics that it had "excess of it," and "from surfeiting, the appetite sickens, and so dies. " And no wonder: -we are essentially a practical people, and think, with Gothe's Faust, that "all theory is gray and the tree of life green." We leave to our friends across the Channel the trouble of finding out the best possible Constitution, and smile at the Irrelevant discussions of German professors how to construct society according to the dictates of pure reason, being satisfied to take up and grapple with each question in succession as it arises. Instead of assuming that everything is bad because it is not perfect, we apply not only to individuals but likewise to institutions the principle of law which presumes innocence until the guilt is proved, and we begin to think of a change onlywhen we have become convinced that the existing state of things is bad. Witlh th'is tumi of mind It wan not wurprWis Vaibt as soon as the Treaty of Paris seemed to have re. gulated Eastern affairs for a time at any rate, the 1 Eastern question as such was put on the shelf and the people of England began to turn their attention from the political to the practical side. Turkey, for which so much English blood and money had bsen lavished, was recognized as a new field for English enterprize, and congresses, protocols, and commis-| sious were forgotten for railways; banks, and telegraphs. The affairs of Bolgrad and the Serpents Island, and all the animosity which accompanied their settle ment, ought to have roused England from hestate of apathetic security, calculated, as it was, to show that a question which Involves more or leis vital interests for all the great Powers in Europe cannot be settled by the best treaty of peac without leaving some points undecided, others doubtful-how much less, then, was itto be expected from a treaty which pretended to solve in le a than a month a problem which has given so many sleepless nights to European statesmen for the last 30 years and more? If nothing else, the number of. commissions appointed by the treaty to settle so many essential details ought to have opened their eyes in this respect. Four of these are still remaining-namely, the commission for the Danubian Principalities at Bucharest, the commission for the improvement of the Danube a; Galatz, the Riverain Commission at Vienna, charged with drawing up the regulations for keep-. ing the Danube navigation open, and, lastly, the commission for the frontier regulations in Asia. Aftr what we have seen respecting Bolgrad, it would have been folly to expect that the remaining commissions should go through their work smoothly and without difficulty, especiaUly as the first step already showed what irritation and animosity most, if not all, the parties evinced even on the most trifling occasions. It seemed as if they wanted to make up for the spirit of conciliation which characterized the Conferences at Paris. 1 t it was, in reality, only an inevitable consequenc ._e hurry which dictated this spirit of apparent conciliation. In the hurry to finish negotiations the questions which were likely to excite lengthy discussions were left to be settled by commission, and the difficulties appear only now when the general dispositions of the treaty are to [be carried out in detail. The most important, the most urgent, and the mos; complicated of the questions still pending is the reorganization of the Principalities. Busy at home with internal politics, and engaged in two wars abroad, the people of England have not thought the question of sufficient importance to turn even the smallest part of their attention to the subject. It is high time that this should change, lest they should find themselves unawares in the position to have to decide a question a hundred times more complicated than that of Bolgrad, without knowing the merits of it. The interest with which the whole continental press has taken up the question, and the latitude which was given to the discussion by the despotic Governments of Europe, would have been alone sufficient to show the importance which was attributed to the final organization of the Danubian Principalities by all the great Powers of the continent, while the diametrically opposite views which were taken by the two parties predicted clearly enough the complication which was inevitable in a case where the parties differed in principle. Thus, whether England was directly interested or not in the settlement of Moldo-Wallachia, she would not remain indifferent, first as a party to the Treaty of Paris, and then as a great European Power which ought to lead and not to follow in the wake of others. It is necessary that the prestige, that the belief in that power and grandeur in the mind3 of Europe, which often saves the costly display o! power, should not be dimmed. But besides these there are even much more weighty special reasons in this case, which make the solution of this question of great importance to England. England is more than any other Power interested in checking the encroachments of Russia, and ia maintaining a State on the Bosphorus which should be able to counterbalance her in the Black Sea. Now it will entirely depend on the organization or the Danubian Principalities whether Earopean Turkey shall be for ever guaranteed from the en. croachment of her northern neighbour, or not. Moldo-Wallachia has been from the beginning the wedge which Russia used to break up the Turkish empire; it was not only her armies which went through the Danubian Principalities to Adrianople, but, what is more important, her moral power and inlfluence entered that way too. At the beginning of every war with Turkey the first movement of her armies was across the Dniester,and, after the annexation of Bessarabia, across thePruth,and notreatyof anyimportance was ever concluded without obtaining some advantages for Moldo-Wallachia. It was owing to her interventionthatthe Principalities emerged from the position of a Turkish Pashalik, which was regularly sold by auction to the highest bidder among the Greeks of the Faual, and that they got, up tdP a certain point, that administrative independence which was guaranteed to them by their original conventions with Turkey. The motives which dictated this conduct of Russia may have been interested, and there may have been many evils of another nature connected with the benefits thus conferred; but they were, nevertheless, real advantages which no one can deny, andwhichled to thatalmost exclusive influence which Russia has exercised for years over tnese provinces. Blut this was not all; the beneficial effects of the Russian protection could not fail to make an impression likewise on the mass of the Christians of the Eastern Church all over Tuirkey, who, with the example of the Danubian Principalities before their eyes, gotgradually accustomed to lookup to the mighty Czar as the onlyprotector from whom they had something to hope; in fact, the tame bird in the cage, with which the birdcatcher used to attract the wild ones. The Western Powers have it now in their hands to put an end once for ever to this sport by giving to the Principalities an organization which, while satisfying their reasonable wishes and opening the door for future development, would close it effectually against all foreign influence. If they fail in doing this there is no power in the world which will prevent Russia from regaining the ground lost by the war and the treaty, for it will convert the great majority of the population to the firm belief that they have no hope beyond Russia, and they will throw themselves body and soul into her protecting hands. But, leaving political considerations altogether aside, let us look at the practical side of the question. The fate of the Danubian Principalities, with their 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 of inhabitants and wonderfully fertile soil, with one of the finest rivers in Europe at their threshold, cannot be Indifferent t) England, which since the abolition of the corn laws imports more than 1,000,000 quarters of grain from them. It is Moldavia andWallachia which furnish the greater part of the corn quoted on the Corn Exchange as arriving from the Black Sea. Any doubt about the matter can be easily removed by comparing the exportation of corn from the Prineipalities before aud after the abolition of the corn laws in England. It has more than doubled-from less than one to fully two millions of quarters. If this was not proof enough, one has only to compare tbelaumber of English vessels and others bound to England with corn now and before the abolition of the corn laws. Then from 10 to 20 English vessels was the average number; now it is 300. Besides this, the great mass of from 600 to 600 Greek vessels2 whichL 1cRva every year Galatz and Ibraila loaded with corn, go likewise to England, so that it may be said that more than half the grain exported goes to England; and this happens while both Principalities suffer under the most shocking specimen of misgovernment, and with the most imperfect means of communication. Fancy them under a good government, favourable to progress, and protected from all foreign interference, and it is not too much to suppose that in less than 10 years the Principalities can export double the quantity, which would exert considerable influence on the corn market of England. It is this servile government and the pressure of foreign influences likewise which have thrown hitherto difficulties in the way of a large importation of English manufactures. Already the first beginning of a free movement of commerce has led to a considerable change; since the Company of the Messageries Imperiales has opened a regular steam communication with Galatz and Ibraila, and thus liberated the importers from the whims of the Austrian Lloyd, which had hitherto the monopoly of the Danube navigation, the applications for the transport of English manufactures have become so great that there are always hundreds of bales waiting in Constantinople for despatch. Now, let these 4,000,000 of wealthy consumers be safe from all interference and at liberty to choose their goods in the cheapest market, and you open a rich new market for English goods. Thus you see that England is not only politically but likewise commercilly interested in the most direct manner in the welfare of the Danubian Principalities. Things have taken such a tern here that the future organization of these provinces Is almost jeopardized. The Treaty of Paris ordered the sending of a European Commission to ascertain the wishes of the population, and, based on the report of the Commission, a Congress, to be assembled, is to decide on their fate. Party spirit, which ran high from the beginning, and even before the meeting of the Commission, has made the injunction of the treaty a farce. With the exception of the British Commissioner all the others have openly hoisted party colours in the question of the union and non-union of the two Principalities. Instead of letting the opinions and wishes, such as they were, manifest themselves freely, they have anticipated the expression of these wishes, and have thus thrown the whole question into an almost hopeless confasion. From impartial judges hearing both sides, as the treaty ordered them to do, they have become agitators, and, instead of allaying party feeling, they have fomented it. The result is that they have caused a breach in the country which cannot fail to have the most deplorable effects on the spirit of the people. If things are not stopped in time, either the work of the Commission will be made impossible, or else the fate of the country will be decided amidst a tumult of passions. Both parties are equally guilty-the French, Russians, Prusians, and Sardinians on one, and the AusBrians and Turks on the other side, and both parties have gone too far to be able to retire with honour. It is England alone which is not compromised, and which ought to be therefore mistress of the situation. It is her duty and interest to recall the adverse parties to order, and to see justice done and fair play. I must leave for my next letter the detailed description of the deplorable state of confusion which has been brought about by the injudicious interference of the European commissioners and agents. All I want on this occasion is to excite the attention of the public in England to a new complication which has been agglomerating in these parts lest they should be taken by surprise and become aware of the state of affairs when It will be too late to mend. ITALY. A letter from Pisa of the 24th inst. states that 26 individuals arrested at Leghorn are to be transferred to the prison of Lucca for trial by the Royal Court. Others are to be merely placed under the surveillance of the police. The proceedings are conducted with the greatest despatch. Reports wera current at Pisa that the police had arrested some of the Constitutional party. It ogiginated in the fact of the police having been informed that the friends of constitutionalreform at Leghorn intended to make a " demonstration," and to appoint delegates to declare to the Government that the Constitutional party held the Mazzini movement in horror, but that at the same time they demanded a returnto constitutional forms. Signor Bargagli, the Governor of Leghorn, thanked them for the excellent sentiment3 with which he was aware they were animated * but he recommended them to make no mnanifeatation whatever, as it would be illegal to do so, and he would feel himself under the necessity of using force to prevent them. Thus matters remain. Accounts from Leghorn of the 18th inst. state that the quantity of arms seized during the late insurrection is but small. It is believed that there are many still concealed. The daggers found are all of the same manufacture. The police are of opinion that, if the insurgents had had any success, numbers of others would have shown themselves. Various reports were current at Rome relative to the successor of the deceased Minister of War. It is believed that one of the chief clerks in the Waroffice will be appointed provisionally to direct the department, and that no Minister of War will be named until the return of the Pope to his capital.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM'ES. Sir,-I have known but to-day that you have inserted in the columns of your paper an article of the French Afoni. tur, and that you have mentioned iny name in the leader of yesterday. I am working very hardly to get my living in London, and I have nothing to do with any one who is now in France. I am sorry that my position of an unlearned work. man does not allow me to do nothing else for the present than to protest with all my heart against the lies of the French Moniteur. I am not guilty of what they accuse me, and I give my residence as a proof that I am not afraid. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. L*ASTANO MAR9A1'PVir 1i, Urevi-stree1t Holborn, July 2A.
MO.NBY-MARKBTandCI2YI.NTELLIGBNP3E. Friday Evening. The conviction that up to this afternoon no news has been received from India, and consequently that all the recent reports, whatever may be tho apprehensions as to the probability of their ultimate realization, have thus far been totally without foundation, has been followed by a diminution of excitement in the stock-markets. Prices, however, have not experienced any permanent rally, although the first transactions were at an advance of an eighth. Consols for money opened at 91k to g, whence they declined to 91. Subsequently there was again a little more firmness, and the concluding operations were at 91k for money, while for the account there were buyers at 91g. The new settlement is fixed for the 9th of September. Loans on Government securities were in request at 6 per cent., and, although the absence of animation throughout the day was mainly attributable to the anxiety regarding India, an increased demand in the discount-market, where nothing was done below the Bank rate, conpled with some light withdrawals of bullion, anda rather les3 favourable appearance of the foreign exchanges, contributed to the general dulness. On the other hand the certainty of a good Bank return this evening and a further decline in the corn-market were calculated to inspire confidence. Bank Stock left off at 214j to 216; Reduced, 9i to i; New Three per Cents., 91 tok; India Stock, 214k to 216k; and Exchequer-bills, 7s. to 4B. discount. Inda-bonds continue to fall, and a sale was made at 25s. discount, the final quotation being 25s. to 15S. discount. The transactions in foreign ecunrities have been very limited, but in some cases prices show an upward tendency. Mexican has been negotiated for the account at 22i ; Peruvian Four-and-a-li per Cents., for the account, 8l ; Russian Five per Cents., 111; Turkish Six per Cents., 9& ; ditto for the account, 95 and 95k; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 102#; for the account, 102X ; andDutch Four per Cents., 98. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no alteration of importance. The accounts of the corn-market to-day were conflicting, but it is believed that sales could not have been pressed except at a decline of between is. and 2s. from the reduced rates of Monday last. 'The report of the Liverpool cottor-market for the week shows a steady business at improving prices. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 90c. for money and 66f. 95c. for the account, showing in the latter case a decline of rather less than an eighth. Notwithstanding the recent further reduction in their stock of bullion, the Bank of France to-day have lowered tbeir rate for advances on stocks and shares from 6 to 4 per cent. The latter was fixed as the discount rate a month back, but the Bourse were excluded from the benefit of the alteration. The Vectis, by which the present homeward Tndia mail will be conveyed to Marseilles, was, it will be remembered, detained two days beyond her proper day of starting for Sir Colin Campbell and Staff; she could not therefore have reached Alexandria until the 20th; and, assuming that the India mails were waiting, she would leave again the next morning and reach Malta some time in the course of to-day. The distance from Malta to Cagliari is 340 miles, so that a steamer despatched immediately would reach the latter place to-morrow afternoon, and the Government may be in possession of telegraphic news in the course of the evening. On the other hand, should the steamer from Calcutta have made an early arrival at Suez, a telegraphic despatch may be hourly looked for vid Trieste. About 13,0001. in gold bars was taken from the Bank to-day for the purchase of silver on the continent. These withdrawals are thought likely to continue, unless some Australian or Californian arrivals soon take place. The Great Britain with 400,0001. will probably be the next from Australia - the amount by the Niagara from America on Monday will be limited by her port of departure being Bostor, and the Parana, from the West Indies and Mexico, which is likely to bring a large total of gold and silver, will not be due till to-morrow week. It appears that the steamers and clippers engaged yesterday by the India-house for the conveyance of troops are to forfeit 30. per day for everyday beyond 70 occupied in their passage to Calcutta, while they are to receive 601. for every day saved from that time. This will, of course, operate as an inducement for speed, although it furnishes no proof that the owners are confident of keeping within the 70 days, since the penalty of 30!. a-day spread even over 10 or 20 days Would be comparatively but a small drawback from the amounts they are severally to receive. Great confidence, however, is felt in the Golden Fleece and Lady Jocelyn, and each of thesewill most probably take out at least 1,000 men. The Lady Jocelyn, which is 500 tons less burden than the Golden Fleece, carried upon one occasion 1,400 troops inthe Black Sea, and owing to alterations her capacity is now onefifth greater than at that period. The Scotland, belonging to Mr. Lindsay, has already made some good passages to Calcutta. This vessel, however, will not carry more than about 320 men. The capacity of the Australian, the Sydney, and the Victoria is also comparatively limited. The total number of men to be taken by steamers, therefore, will probably not exceed 4,000. The sailing clippers James Baines and Champion of the Seas will each take a reg iment, and, although experience has shown that on the Eastern voyage the difference between the screw and the clipper gives an average of at least one-third in favour of the former, some persons are disposed to anticipate that the performance of these vessels will equal that of the rsteamers. The terms paid for the steamers range from 391. to 491. per man. For the James Baines and Champion of the Seas the rate is 25!. per man, and for the smaller sailing vessels it is 181. The Golden Feece and Lady Jocelyn are ordered to be ready at Portsmouth on Wednesday next, but that is supposrd to be impossible. There is a penalty of 101. for each day's delay. The produce-markets during the week have been steady, although rather quiet. The speculative inquiry for some articles has, however, received a further stimulus by the rumours circulated from time to time of unfavourable accounts from India. Sugar again receded Is. 6d. to 2s. on Tuesday. To-day speculators, as well as the home trade, appeared to have regained confidence, and, with limited supplies offering by importers, the decline was generally recovered. The telegraphic notices of the Dutch Company's sale of Java, held yesterday, have proved rather contradictory, but mostly agree that fine sugars for Russia went dearer, while low and middling ranged from 2 to 4 florins under the quotations in May. Coffee has become inactive, plantation Ceylon scarcely supporting its former value, notwithstanding the smallness of the quantity offered. A cargo of Costa Rica, the first of the new crop, has arrived. Cocoa is firm, and West India again dearer. The sales of rice have been unimportant, at slightly lower rates. Saltpetre continues in active demand, and has further advanced ls. to 1s. 6d., excepting for the finest qualities, with large speculative operations, including several hundred tens of Bengal "to arrive," at 44s. to 4Gs. 6d. per cot. The quarterly sales of cinnamon arepostponed -until the 3d of A-u-oust, owvin., to the arrival of 650 bales per Indiana from Ceylon. The periodical sales of indigo terminated yesterday, and, as compared with the prices in Mlay, desirable qualities were from 4d. to 9d. higher, and low and ordinary from par to 3d. Of 12,132 chests brought forward 7,000 were sold. At a meeting to-day of the Scottish Australian Tnvestment Company, Mr. W. R. Dickson in the chair, a dividend was declared for the half-year at, the rate of 10 per cent. per annum, free of incometax. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- ~ The directors have the pleasure to state that the profit realized iu considerably larger tha that of the previous six months, amounting to IT,5551. for the half-year endingi in colony on the 31st ot December, 1856, and In London on the 30th of Juneolast. "In their last report the directors mentioned that in September, 18D6, the manager was effecting the sale of some properq' on satisfactory termls. The accounts subsequently tion then referred to wFas higher than they then anticipated. "Ia the accounts last submitted the sum of 5,001! was stated as an asset of the leasehold coallield (300 acres) at Newcastle, New South Wales, less a sum of 1,500. then written off as loss, and which amount nas slnce bwen increased by 2251., as shown by the colonial accounts, dated subsequent to the 30th of June, 1856, thus making the amount at the debit of the account at the 31Bt of December, 1846, 3,726! The Idirectors stated at the last half-yearly meeting that there was much reason to consider that the greater portion, if not the whole, of this expenditure would most probably have to be thereafter treated as a loss. The manager has sinco t,aken a imila Tlew, and iu baanslag b t1s o B C£ December be has eharged the whole 3,7261. aganst the profit of ths half-year. Notwithstanding the course now adopted, the directors are not without hope that some portion of the amount may eventually have to be recredited. Tbe directors proposeadividend, payableon the3d of August, en the capital of 200,000.,at the rate of 10!. per cent. per annum, less income-tax, which will require 10,0001., and (after writing-off the above 3,7261.) will leave a balanoe of 1,074K . from the halfyeas profit, to be carried to t&h credit of the reserved fund, which will then amount to. 5,9461. The directors have the satisfaction of stating that they have contracted Ifor the sWle of the Bon Accord property to the Bon Accord Copper lining Company at the price of L12,0004 eashand 8.000 shares of ". sterlng each in that company, with 10s. per share paid up thereon, together with a share of the royalty of one-twentieth of all the ore to be raised. This sale will leave a considerable profit to be carriedto the credit of the next half-yearly accounts. At the date of the lst communications from the manager, being the 10th day of April last, the affairs of the company were going on steadily in their usual manner; the rate of interest, however, ruling lower than has generally been the case in the colony." from the Bank of t for the T.he return fFom the Bank of England for the week ending the 18th of July gives the following results when compared withL the previous week:- Public depodts . . £3,419,956 ...

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, JuLY 24. The quotations of fair Uplands and Mobile cotton have advanced id. per lb. since this day week, but we have no corresponding rise in cloths. In India 40.inch shirtings, madapollams, and jaconots there is no alteration in prices, buyers having almost suEpended business until fresh advices are to band, and intelligence by the overland mail is now looked for withgreatanxiety.Incloths for othermarkets there continueB to be a fair demand. Longcloths, T-cloths, the better classes of shirtings for the home trade, printing cloths, and jaconots suitable for the Glasgow market are aU saleable at a slight advance on last quotations but the advance bears no proportion to the increased cost of production caused by the rise in the raw material. Spinners continue to keep a better position, and are realizing higher rates. The large purchases they have made this week at Liverpool, where nearly 69,000 bales have been taken by the trade, shows that they have found reaseon some-whore for believing in the continuance of hi h prices. In te event of more encouraging newvs from India it is pro. ale that prices will go higher; but, with the limited business domg, in the event of adverse intelligence it need not bea atter of surprise if the cotton specuttors reoeive awhiech.

RAILWAY INTELLIGENOB. RAILWAY REMPTS. flhe following are the receipts of railways for the past Week:- C LONDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOuTH COAST. The half.yearlv meeting of this company was held yesterday at the Bridge-house Hotel, London-bridge, Mr. L Schuster In the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in yUe Timee, was taken as read. The CHAIRar, in moving the adoption of the report, said they had expended the whole of their capital with the exception of 1,0001. They had expended 6,000.L on capital acconnt during the past half-year on works that could not by possibility be postponed. They would not, of course, be surprised to hear that the directors intended to apply to Parliament for power to raise additional capital to the amount of 200,0001. He had intimated at their meeting in January last that it wa not to be expected, with an expanding traffic, that their capital account could remain stationary. In asking powers to raise the 200,0001. he could assure them that no part of it would be expended unless it was absolutely necessary. It was the duty of the directors to watch the expenditure as carefully as possible. Their wants now were not very great, and the sum they proposed to obtain power to raise would last a conBiderable time. The Lewes station required iniprovement. It was very awkwardly situated for trains runming in and running out of the station. This they proposed to rectify in order to accommodate the Hasting and Lewes trafflo. The Three-bridges! station, where the orsham branchat oneside and the East Grinstead branch at the other diverged from the main lne, required improvement. The Horsham branch brought a great deal of traffic on their line, and it was proposed to extend It by means of the Mid-Sussex line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth. There was at present not sufficient covering for the paEsengers at that station, and he thought the time had arrived, if they were to retain their good name, for providing the necessary accommodation for the traffic at that station. In their outlay on those works they would look to economy and efficiency, in order that the money thus expended should produce something like a return. They must also look at the rolUing-stock, which was now in excess of their requirements, and was in a most efficient state. Bnt on the opening of the West-end line to its terminal station near S cane-street, which would take place about the end of the year, they would require a few additional carriages and vans for the new traffic. A wooden viaduct at Shoreham would require renewal, as at present it required constant care and expense to keep it in repair. It was necessary to construct dwellings for the platelayers near the line, as there was nothing like having plenty of men available In case of emergency. This outlay would be productive, as tho platelayers were anxious to have dwellngs near their works, and to pay rent for them. This outlay would come into operation n 1858. They would not requie any great amount of the 200,000Z. The reason they proposed so large a sum was to do away with the necessity of applying to Parliament again for some years, and to eave expense. He then alluded to the revenue of the company, which he considered was very satisfactory. The traffic had not only increased in every item, but also on every part of their system of railways. In the corresoonding half of 1856 they had an increase of 20,0001. in their receipts, derived exclasively from the conveyance of troops, munitions of war, and peace festivities, but they could notas distinctly tracethe individual movements of officers and men over the line as they could when they moved in large bodies, but, at all events, the gross traffic of the past half-year showed an increase of between 6,0001. and 7,0001. over the corresponding period of 1856. Their present sources of traffic showed an increase of about 30,0001. over those of the first half of 1856, and the latter showed an increase of 32,0001. over the corresponding half of 1855. He might mention that the traffic of Brighton proper-he meant the traffic from London to Brighton an from Brighton to London-amounted to not quite one-fourth of the total receipts of their system. With regard to the ordinary expenses, they had increased 6,0001. over the corresponding period, in consequence of working the West-end line, which was not complete, butt stopped at Wandsworth-common, and of course the 42A per cent. of the traffie allowed did not pay the expenses of work. ingand maintaining the new line. The traffic over it was considerable; about 10,000 passengers per week were conveyedover it to and from London-bridge station. Theyhad the full rate for them from the Palace to the Bridge. When the line was extended to near Sloane-street he believed they would convey from 50,000 to 100,000 passengers per week over it. Mr. ScOTT seconded the adoption of the report. Mr. HERAPATHr said he was by no means a friend to increasmg the capital account, but if they could realize anything lie 6 or 7 per cent. by so doing on productivo works he supposed they must be satisfied. He would much rather, if possible, pay out of revenue for everything necessary to develo-e the traffic than increase the capital. If he were to propose that course he knew it would be opposed. He was rather surprised to hear the ehairman state that the Brighton traffic did not yield more than one-fourth of the whole, as the carriages were generally well filled on that line. It was true it was only 51 miles in length. The CHAniRmA explained that the traffic he had mentioned only related to that between London and Brighton, and did not include traffic over the Brighton line to other places on their railway. After some observations from Mr. BELL and other shareholders the report was unanimously adopted, and a dividend at the rate of 21. 10s. per cent. was declared for the halfyear. Captain YOUNG moved his usual resolution, to the effect that all systematic Sabbath traffic on the company's line be discontinued, and that provision be made to meet eases of necessity and mercy. The motion was seconded and negatived. On the motion of Mr. HxRAPATH a vote of thanks was passed to the chairman and directors, and the meeting sepa. rated.
HEB MAJiSTrS THEATRE. The performance last night was one of the best of the season. The opera was La Cenercnto1a of Rossini-which tn the class to which it belongs only ranks second to It Ba-biere di Siviglis-and Alboni was the heroine. Thst s-ich a work, with such a represenhtive of the principa character at hand, should have been kept back until now' when the theatre is about to close, is singular. The audience on the present occasion, both capable of discriminating nd inclined to be enthusiastic, were rewarded by some of the most briliant singing ever heard. The first romance-" Una volta c'era un Re"-Which Cene' rentola warbles while she prepares the coffee for her more favoured si"srs-at once showed that Alboni was "in vein," and resolved upon exerting all her powers to please. The beautiful mellow tones of the lower register of her voice were brought out to the highest advantage in this quaint melody; and the simplicity with which it was delivered afforded equally an example of good taste and artistio discernment. The next "effect" was made in the duet with Don Ramiro, the last movement of which gave a foretaste of that incomparable execution so surPrisingly exhibited later in the evening. The finale to the fir act contains an example of the ornamented " largo" (a conventional term for expressing one of the various kinds of I slow movement, to which our language yields no equivalent) belonging to the elder and nobler Italian art, of Which Rossini has produced so many fine specimens, but not one finer. In this (" Sprezzo quei don chevesae), and in the slow movement preceding the famous "N Non piu mesta," at the end of the opera, Alboni-not for the first timetriumphantly declared herself the greatest living mistress of the highest school of singing. Her phrasing was superb, and amid all the elaborate embellishments the rounded periodwas never once neglected, the closing cadence neither checked nor hurried Such displays are calculated to satisfy and delight just as much s they astonish. The rondo itself-the " non pi mesta," to which allusion has been made-was, as usual, a masterpiece of fluent vocalization, in which not one solitary weak or faltering note was heard, to interfere with the marvelions perfection of the whole. The excitement it created was prodigious, aud the cry for an " encore" so unanimous and tumultuous that Alboni, after appearing before the curtain, was absolutely compelled to depart from her ordinary habit of resisting these demands, and repeat it to the increased gratification of her admirers, who again summoned her before the footlights. The sensation created was iiot to be wondered at, singing so faultless being rarely heard in the present day. The execution of the opera was almost unexceptionably good. SignorBelart, thenewtenor, was thebestDonRamiro we have seen for a long time, and raised himself another step in public estimation. Signor Roesi gave the music of Don Magnifico with remarkable ease and spirit; and, as there is not now upon the stage a more thorough master of the florid style than Signor Belletti, it my be readily believed that the part of Dandini was sung to admiration. In such able hands the concerted pieces could not fail to be effective; and, indeed, there was little or nothing to desire, except, perhaps, an occasional glimpse of that histrionic humour of which Tamburini, Lablache, and Ronconi have handed us down the traditions.
OLYMIPIC THEATRE. last night Mr. WVigan formally took leave of the public, which had assembled in great force to celebrate his benefit with appropriate honour. Almost to the moment when his sddress was actually deUvered a doubt was entertained whether the indisposition that causes him to retire from management would not prevent him from performing the mnelancholy duty announced in the programme. However, at the end of the second piece he came forward, amid loud and encouraging cheers, the expression of his countenance bearing witness to the depth of his feeings on this reaUy Eolemn occasion. After a short pause, during which he coUected himself with some difficulty, he spoke as follows:- " lAdies and Gentlemen,-I appear before you this evening under the influence of very strong feelings-feelings of e, gratitude, and regret. This has been aunouncn as * ewee benefit, but it is not the familiar farewell of the outworn veteran, retiring in the natural decay of his powers to the leisure fairly earned by long service. It is the leave-taking of one stopped short in midcourse-in the most vigorous time of life-compelled to retire from managementwhen most successful, and from acting when in the full enjoyment of your favour and approbation, by strange and unforeseen illness. But with pi at this unlooked for close (for the present, at least) my managerial and professional career are blended pride and gratitude for the favours so liberally bestowed upon me for years past, and so nobly crowned this evening. I have had the honour of mnanaging the Olympic Theatre for four years, or, morestrictly spealdng, forthree years, for durin the whole of the present season the active business Of mnanagement in brery department has devolved upon my wife. During that period ten pieces have been got up and produced under her sole superintendence, and I trust you wll not attribute it toa husband's partiality if Isayshe has performed her task well and bravely under circumstances of peculiar difficulty and depression. That the pubic has been satisfied with her exertions is best proved by that most satisfactory of all tests-the balance-sheet. The result ox the season has been prosTerity and profit, where disaster and loss must have been looked for had I not possessed so able and indefatigable a substitute. She can no longer support the fatigue, excitement, and anxiety of such exertion without risk, and I am therefore compelled to retire until I may again be able to take my share of labour. The course I have adopted durirg my management has, I am proud to think, raised the Olympic Theatre to a high position in public favour, and I can look back and fearlessly say that its success has been honestly and fairly won by hard and well-directed work. When retrospect leaves this feeling, no wonder that parting from the theatre and from you, its indulgent patrons, should be very painfuL But onpainful feelings I will not dwelL After surmounting the many difficulties in the way of firmly establishing this theatre as a place ofrational and harmless amusement, I shall, on the 7th of next month, relinquish all connexion with it; but I shall always feel a warm interest in its fortunes, and a sincere wish that it may long enjoy the success that has hitherto attended it. I have now a large debt of thanks to pay to the gentlemen of the newspaper press, for the fairness and the goodnature of their criticisms upon the performances at this theatre, and also for the warm and cordial sympathy which they have expressed with my present position; to the committee of friends who have done me the great honour to associate their illustrioas names with mine; to the authors who have written for me; and to my company generally, not only to my brother actors for their zealous and loyal co-operation (more especially during this last season, under the direction of my wife), but to every one employed in the theatre, down to tho humblest artisan; and above all, my warm thanks are due to the public, whose support bas0so enerously rewarded my exertions. For myself, should the nlessing of health be restored tome-and Iwill look forward hopefully-I may again be able to contribute to your amusement, ivhen I trast that, by keeping to the same coarse, the same result will follow-that success will be won by a sincere desire and an earnest effort to deserve it. Bat should my hopes be doomed to disappointment-should this be my last appearance before you, I will carry with me to the end the memory of the great hIndness I have always received at your hands-kdndness so warm, so sympathetic, and so unvarying, that it leaves me scarcely able to pronounce that word which for me blends so much sweetness with so much sadness. But, linger as I may, it must be spoken; and so, Indies and gentlemen, good friends and patrons, I most respectfully and gratefully bid you all farewrell." iever, probably, was a speech delivered with more genuie and unaffected eloquence than the above. The sad countenance of the excellent actor and manager, whose right arm was in a sling, the voice suppressed throughout, though never becoming inaudible, and the almost choked atterauce when he approached the conclusion, gave a meaning to the words which, well-chosen as they are, cannot be perceived by a mere reader. The printed epeech, however, answers our purpose. It exactly states the cause of Mr. Wigan's retirement, with all its mournful peculiari. ties, and renders superfluous any comment on his management and its termination. When Mr. Wigan had left the stage an unanimous call was raised, and he soon reappeared leading forwvard 3frs. Wigan, whose services he had so justly and so touchingly recorded. They beth retired amid the deafening cheers of the whole audience,
ADELPHI TEATRET. Last night Mr. and Mrs. Barney Wiiams, who have raled this theatre for the last few weeks in their respective capacities of the "Irish Boy" and "Yankee Girl"-expressions which have almost become their surnames-took their farewell benefit, and the farce of the Happy Man was revived for the occasion. Every playgoer recollects that the felicity of the "happy man" is shown by his uninterrupted joyousness while suffering under the privation of that very useful article of linen that is deemed especially necessary to human comfort. The King of the Oriental region in which the wonderful Hibernian finds himself can only be cured of a tedious malady by the shirt of a happy man. There aro many ahirted individuals within reach, but with these happiness is not. The happy individual is indeed found at last, but he merely owns that faint symbol of a shirt which, we believe, has not a name in any dictionary, but which in common parlance is termed a " dickey." Now, if any one would select a figure capable of radiating with a perfect halo of Hibernian felicity, that figure would be Mr. Barney Williams, whose cunning sparklng eye and beaming countenance have so often diffused mirth over the london public. It should be added that the happy man, being Ekewise a military man, plays upon the arum, in which accomplishment Mr. Wil. liams is a remarkable proficient. In the course of the evening Mr Barney Willians played two of those "Yankee gals " who are now the pets of the London public. Two years ago nobody knew what a "Yankee gal" was; but now the songs attributed to our fair cousins are heard on ver organ, and the inimitable manner in which Mrs Barney Williams represents the selfreliance of New England has become one of the acknowledged forms of feminine grace. Both artists have done good servioe to the London public. The gentleman has given us a serles of first-rate impersonations in a well-known line; the lady has advanced our ethnological erudition.
APPEALS. HOUSE OF LORDS. Tmr 24A Their Lordshipe sat this afternoon for the purpose of giving judgment in the following appeals:- THE X&YOR, &C., OF REVERLEY V. THE ATrORMNW GENERA. The LoRD CEANCELLoR, in giving bis judgment, said that this was an appeal from a decision of theLords Justices affirming an order of the Master of the Rufls with respeCt to an information filed by the Attorney-General. The question arose upon the will of a gentleman named Metcalf, mnade by him in 1652, by which he gave certain estates to the Masyor, &c., of the towun of Beverley, in Yorkshire, in trust to employ the yearly rents thereof, then amounting to 471., in manner following :-That they should pay unto the lecturer of the said town and his successora the yearly sum of IO., and to the schoolmaster of the said town and s successors the sum of IO., and to the testator's sister during her life the sum of 20Y, and after her death that they should pay the said 201. yearly unto three pe** scholars of tho said town for their better main. tenance at the University of Cambridge-viz., to each one of the said three poor scholars the sum of 61. 13s, 4d., and no more. If there were no such poor schnlars then in the interim, until there should be such poor scholars, the balance remaining out of such 20. should be distributed among the poor of the said town. The surplus of the said rents-namely, 71.-was to belong to the mayor, &c., for the purpose of defraying taxes, expenses, &-o., which might accrue on the said lands. The testator also left another estate, then worth 22M. lOs. per annum, but now 45b., in trust to the said mayor, &c., to pay 201. yearly to the poor of the said town, and the surplus, 21. 10s., to the mayor, ko., to defray the taxes, &c. Those rents had considerably increased, and the question was to whom the surplus was to o, it being now carried to the account of the borough funa for the general purposes of the corporation. The Master of the olls had decided that 40-47th parts of the rents of the first estate, and 40-45tbs of the second esate were to be applied to charitable purposes, and the rest to the mayor for the purposes mentioned. That decison was appealed from, and the Lords Justices affirmed it. That lbtter decision was now appealed from. He (the Lord Chancellor) was of opmion that the decree of the Master of the Rolls was erroneous, together vith the decdsion of the Lords Justices affirming that decree. He con. sidered that the surplus to go to the mayor, &c., of Beverley meant the entire surplus, after deducting the particular sums directed to be paid by the testator. Under these air. emstances he should advise their Lordships to reverse the decison of the Court below. Lord BR0ouoau and Lord WENSLEYDALE concurred. Appeal allowed accordingly, and the case remitted to the Court of Chancery, with a declaration that the information ought to have been dismissed. : THE REV. PHMPOTT V. THE PRESIDENT, &C., OF ST. GEORGE'S HOSPITAL. THE ATIORNEY-GENERAL V. FEIPOrr AND OTHERS. THE PrSIDxNT, &c., OF S. GEOPrGE'S HosPITAL V. PHILPOTT AND OTHERS. This case was argued on Tuesday, when their Lordships deferred giving judgment. The LORD CANcELLo.o, in delivering his opinion in the appeal, now said this was a similar case to the last; at least sof arthat it related to charity lands. Tho question rested entirely upon the construction to be put upon the Mortmain Act. It apFeared that Earl Beauchamp, by his will dated the 18th of une, 1817, bequeathed the snm of 60,0001. for charitable purposs in the following manner:-" And whereas I have contemplated erecting and endowing almLs. houses either upon some part of my estate or elsewhere in the hamlet of Newlamd aforesaid, for the residence of 12 or some larger number of poor men and women, members of the Church of England, who shall have been employed in agriculture and have been reduced by sickness, mis ortune, or Infirmity; now, in cae I happen to die without effecting such object, and any persons or person should within 12 months after my decease, at ther, his, or her expense, purchase or give a suitable piece of Land in Newland aforesaid, as a site for such alms. houses, and with intent that the same should be devoted to such purpose, then I empower and direct the trustees or trusteefor the time being of this my will, when and so soon as such land shall have been legally dedicated to charitable uses, provided they, he, or she shall approve the scheme of the intended chanty, and the rules and regulations proposed for the gvernmeut thereof, to payto the trustees of the said intended charity out of such my personal estate as is herein mentioned the sum of 60,0001., to be by them devoted to the several purposes of the said charity in the manner to be determined in respect of the funds of the same; but so, nevertheless, that the said sum or any partthereof shall not be appliedinortowardsthepurchaseof any lands for the purposes of the said charity." The will then went on to provide that if no suchlandshouldbe found andprovided, the 60,0001. should go to the trustees for the time being of St. George's Hospital. Within 12 months after the death of Earl Beauchamp a Mr. Scott by an indenture gave certain lands for the purpose of the charity mentioned in the will, and the Attorney-General filed an information against the trustees of Earl Beauchamp's will, and against the president, &c., of St. George's Hospital, for the purpose of having it declared that the 60,0001. was a legal legacy, and ought to be appropriated for the purposes of the charity mentioned in wine velL It was contended by the president, &c., of St. George's Hospital that the legacy to the charity was void, inasmuch asit came within the meaning of the statuteof the 9th of GeorgeII., entitled " an Act to restrain the disposition of lands whereby the same became inalienable," inasmuch as the legacy in questionwasa gift of money forthe purpose of procuring the dedication of land to charity, and was thus not dLstinguishable from a bequest of money to be laid out or disposed of in the purchase of land for charity. The Master of the Rolls being of this opinion dismissed the in. formation, and his decision was confirmed bythe Lords Justices. Hle (the Lord Chancellor) was of opinion that both decisions were wrong, and, as he considered that the bequest was perfectly legal, he should advise their Lordships to reverse the decision of the Court below, the costs to come out of the 600001. about which the dispute had arisen. Lord CROvGHEI, together with Lord WExsEDALE, concurred. Appeal allowed accordingly.
KEAY'S DIVOBRCE. HOUSE OF LORDS, JULY 24. .LS was sue p Oenson ot Mr. Robert Keay, of Bombay, praying that his marniage with MTaria Eliza, his now wife might be dissolved, and to enable him to marry again. Mr. WORDSYWORiTH said, he bad the honour of appeanrng at their Lordshipse bar on behalf of the petitioner, Mr Robert Keay, resident at Bombay, in the presidency of Bombay, in the East Indies, a member of the civil service of the Hon. East India Company, and an acting judge at Tanner, near Bombay. The parties were married in Decamber, 1837, in the presence of Mr. Edward Grant, of the Bombay civil service, the father of the lady. They lived together very happilv until 1847, having had two children, both of whom died. In 1847 mlrs. Keay became very unwell, and she was sent by her hnsband to the hills for change of air. While there she met with a Captain Harvey, with whom it wouald be proved she committed the adultery charged. Nothing, however, came to the ears of the husband until 1854, when, Ms Keay having left India for .England, he discovered what had taken place. From the depositions it would be proved that Captain Harvey had been frequently seen in MIs. Keay's bedroom while she was living away from her husband at the hills, and also at other places. In June, 1854, a divorce a mensd et thoro was obtained by Mr. Keay, and m October, 1855, he recovered a verdict with 4001. an the Court of Common Pleas, which sum, together with the costs, had been paid by the defendant, Captain Harvey. Under these circumstances he (Mr. Wordsworth) trusted that their Lordships would grant the prayer of the petitioner. Mr. Henry Young, the Chief Secretary to the Government at Bombay, said he was at school with the petitioner. He had married the petitioner's sister. He knew the wife of the petitioner. She was the daughter of Mr. Grant, then of Bombay. They had two children, both of whom were dead, They had paid him several visits. Mr. Keay was acting judge of the Sudder Dewanee and Sudder Foujdaree Adawlat. Mr. Keay wasalways very kind to his wife. Mrs. Keay was always very delicate in health. She was advised to come to England, but as she was averse from returninglhere Mr. Keay bought her a house at the Hills. Mr. Keay was unable to go to tho Hills, except during one month in the year. It was ver comon for ladies to go to the Hils for change of air. tn 1853 Mr. and Mrs. Keay paid him a visit. They were then living at Tanner. They came to his house at Bombay for the purpose of arranging for Mrs. Keay's passage to England. Mr. Keay left Mrs. Keay at his house. He knew Captain Harvey. He himself was called away during the day by his duties. When he returned he found that Mrs. Keay had left, and had returned to Tanner. In 1S51 Mr. and Mrs. Keay again came to his house. The next day heard Mr. Keay went on board the vessel with Mrs. Keay to see her off. Mr. Keay appeared much more affected at parting than Amrs. Keay. The day after she sailed he made lr. Keay acquainted with certain ramours which were aflost respecting his wife and Captain Harvey. He appeared much shocked. He did not inform the petitioner of what he had heard until after Mrs. Keay sailed, becauee he was not sure that the rumonrs were true, and he did not wish to distress him without ascertaining their truth. Mr. Wordsworth was then about to read over the material portions of the depositions, when The LoRD CHANCMELLOR said they would look over the depositions, and if they were not satisfied they would hear him at some future period. as it was then past 5 o'clock. Further consideration adjourned accordingly.

sUMMER ASSIZES. 2NORTHEIRN eCuIRCI. DURHAX, THU1SDAY, JULY 23. U=E UIVIL COURT.-(BCJOre lfr. Baron CR&LNsZLLJ The COURT was oeu ied some time this morning wLth hearing the conclusion ofan adjourned action on an attorney's bilL WALTERS V. FAITH. This was an action of covenant and for ue and oceupa. tion of a coal mine, brought by3 Mr. Ralph Walters, of Newcastle, against Mr. George aith, an attorney ofLondon, asa director of the Northern Coal Mining Company, to recover 1,400L, arrears of rent of the White Lea and Old Roddimoor collieries, lot by different leases by Mr. Walters to the company, one of which was executed by the defendant and the other not. Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Hellish appeared for tho laintif and M1r. HWil, QX., and Mr. Tnthank for the efendant. Tle mines in quetfion origi"ay belonged to Mr. John Charles Ord, who became bankrupt a few years ago, and on the sale of his property the plaintiff beoame the purhsser of the mines in question, whic at thattime were eased tothe defendant's company. It appeared that 424 acres of these mines belonged to the plaintiffand 47acres to a miss Pease. The whole of the mines were rented to the company at the Cearly rent of 8554, a proportional part of which only longed to the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded, in addition to numerous other pleas, a aet off inz espect of the plant of the colliery, alleged to have been bought by the plaintiff. Notice had been given in .!ay, 1852, to determine the lease, pursuant to powers contained in it; a Chancery suit had been brought, and in oonsequence of the ViceChancellor stating that the plaintiffs remedy, if any, was at law, this action was brought. The pleadiDgs and issues rised being of a most comPicated and embarras6ing nature, ramng numerous legal questions, it was areed that the facts rhould ho turned into a spcecal case for the opinion of the Court of Exchequer, which Court was to nave the Powe of a jury to draCw inferences of fact. REGINJA V. BALLEiT. This was a criminalinformation filed by direction of the Attorney-GeneragainstRobertBaeflyg. a m trato of this county, and tried before a apecl jury, clrgmng the defendant in the first count with unlawfoly and by colour of his offlce as a justice of peaceo of the connty, extorting from George Spoors the sum of it. for compounding offence punshable bylaw. The second count charged that George ppoors and John Story were treepssinginpursuit of game, and that an information being lid against them, the defendant extorted 1 each from them to compound the offence, and applied the money to his own use. A third count varied the charge, and alleged that the defendant had corruptly and by vtite of his offce demanded from George Spoors 1., and threatened to have him handcuffed and sent to prison if he did not pay, and that George Spoors by means of these unlawful demands and threats and handcufl ing bad been induced to pay the sum of I1., which the defendant had converted to his own Use. The fourth count charged the same offence as to John Story. MIr. Atherton, Q.C., and the Hon. A. Liddell prosecuted, and Mr. Serjeant Atknson and M1r. Davlson appeared for the defence. Mr. ATIIERToN, instating the case to the jury, maid this was an important inquiry as relating to the administration of justice. In recent periods such a prosecution as this was unprecedented, and it had been instituted by direction of the Attorney-General, whom he had the honour to represent on that occasion. Mr. Robert Balleny, the defendant, was a gentleman residing at a place called Little Green Croft, and for the last 16 years he had been in the commission of the peace for this county. The circumstances on which the prosecution was founded had been first brought to the attention of the Lord-Lieutenant of the county, afterwards to the notice of the Lord Chancellor, and then came before the Attorney-General, who woald have failed in his duty to the State if he had omitted to institute the present proceedings On the 2d of July last, two police-constables named Rokson and Scott on going late at night from Lanchester to Crook-hall observed two men named Spoors and Story Poachingana field of the defendant, armed with a gun. The constables in the discharge of their duty apprehended the men and took them before the nearest magistrate, who happened to be the defendant, and before him, of course in his magisterial capacity, laid an information against the two men, in order that the offence might be dealt with according to law. The defendant then addressed the men thus, " If yon will pay 11. each you may go; if not you Wml be taken to Lanchester and lockedup, and wll be brought before the magistrates next day and fined 40s. and cestsL Without waitingfortheanswerofthemenaccused he asked thepoliceman Robson "if he had gotthematerlals,"meaning the handcuffs, and on Robson saylng he had the defendant thereupon orderedhim to handcuff the two men. The men on being handcuffed were told that if they did not pay the money that night they would bo handed over to the county police. On hearing this the men requested the constables to allow them to go to Bury Hedge, where they lived, and where they would get the money. The constables accord. ingly took the men there, and they, having got the money, handed it over to Robson, who then liberated them, and Robson handed the money next day to the defendant, and asked him to enter the case. The defendant then said that he was not finig the men, And that nothing was due to the county or to the superannuation fund, and that he should take the money as damages for the trespass in his field. He then offered Robson 10s. for himself and the other constable. Robson said they were not allowed to receive any money, and that he mnst hand it over to his superintendent. It was true that the field in which the men were bappened to bo the defendanVs, but they were taken before the defendant as a magistrate, and there was no pretence for saying that compensation had been demanded by him apart rom his office as a magistrate. On these facts the indictment charged him for extorting this money from the men accused by virte of his; office, and with afterwarda corruptly applying the money so extorted, after compoundimga legal ofence,to his own nse. The learned counsel then caled and examined Edward Robson, policeman.-On the 2d of July he had to goto Lauchesterwvith some prisoners. On his way back tovo}bUhe sawr two men in one of Mr. Balleny's fields. Mr. Balleny acts asa magistrate. The men had a gun. They were In search of game. He apprehended them and took them before Mr. Balleny and made a charge against them of being in the field in search of game, and stated the circumstances under which he had found them. Mr. Balleny said to them that it they paid to him 11. a-piece they should go; if not they would be t3ken to Lan. chester and locked up at the police-station, and they would be brought up next day and fined 40s. and costs. Mr. Balleny then asked witness if he had got somnething, which he understood to behandcuffi. Witnesssaidhehad, and the defendanttold him to handcuff the men and take them to Bury Hedge and hand them over to the county police. One of the men lived at Bury Hedge, the other balf a mile off, near some ironworks, where they had work. He took the mento Bury Hedge, handcuffed from Mr. Balleny's presence. At Bury Hedge the men paid him U. each. The gun was left with Mr. Balleny, Mr. Balleny sayin "he would take her." The mall Spoors said it was a harN case to pay It. and likewise to losO the gun. After they had paid the 11. he let the men go. The next morning he paid the money over to Mr. Balleny, and asked him to enter the case. MIr. Balleny said the men were not fined, and nothing was due to the superannuation fund. This fund was formed from a portion of the fines. The defendant gave him los. back, 5s. for himself and the other 5s. for Scott, the other policeman. Witness said they were not allowed to take any money; the chief constable would not allow it. The defendant said if the chief constable would not allow it, or anything was said about it, he was to give him the money back again. Cross-examined.-The defendant, he knew, had acted as a magistrate 12 years, and had something to do with the board of guardians. He was the only magistrate in that district, and he had taken a great many persons before him. Both SpOOrs and Story were married men. Theyworked at the; ironworks, and the company were very strict about their men poaching. The defendant talked of sending them to Lanchester, and Story aid he would rather have it settled there; his wife was lying very ill, and they came down there to get a rabbit for the wife. It was safer touse handcuffs, and he used them. The l0s. was paid over toth su erintendent. Re-examined.-e did not afterwards inform Mr. Balleny that he had reported the caseto his sergeant. John Scott, the constable, with the last witness, corroborated this statement. George Spoors examined.-He and Story were taken before Mr. Balleny on the 2d of July. He heard Robson make a charge against them. Mr. Balleny told them they must pay 1 each, or be taken to Lanchester and fined 40s. next day. Before this he told the defendant they had been to his field in search of a rabbit. Witness said they had not the money on them. The defendant said if it were not settled that night they must go to Ianchester. Witness msid if he would aluow them to go home, or givo them a day or two, they would pay the money. B then asked the policeman if he had the " materials" with him. 'l'he poceman at frst did not Eeem to understand him, bht afterwards did and said, " Yes," and produced some handcuffs. The poltceman then asked who took possession of the gun, and the defendant said he did. Witness said it iasvery hard for him to lose the gun and pay the money likewsise. He said if they did not pay them oney that night they would ob fined. He then allowed them to ce taken to Bury Hedge, and they were takeen hahndcued there, and raised the money, and were Cross-examined.-He had never seen the gun since. Re-examined.-Story's wife was ailing and took a fancy to a rabbit, and there were none to be got, and he and Story borrowed a gun, and they went out to try and get a rabbit, George Story corroborated the statement of the last witness. MIr. John Tiplady, the deputy.clerk of the peace for the county of Durham, produced the ommisaion of the peace for the ounty and the oaths, In the ommission he found the name of Rtobert Bdlleny, of Green Croft. Cross-examined.-His ommission was dated 1S39, This was the case against the defendant. Mr. AT5nOnoN aubitted that the first two counts charged no offence, as they charged compounding a misdemeanour, which was no offenco in law, and he would tsko hbi lordships opinion whether he need go to the jury on those counts. hr. Serjeant ATHERTON said the objection was on the record His LORDSH sid he should leave the question to the jury whether the defendant did extort the money he was charged with having done by colour of his office. The offenco charged in theme two couints was compounding an offencepunishable by law, and he thought thelearnedcounsel must go to the jury on these counts as on the others. Mr. Ser3eant ATHINSON then addressed the jury for the defendant. He sid this was a mode of proceeding whiehx would not have the sympathies of the jury.

E;noch Jordan, aged 27, brickinaker, Henry Black, aged 37, labourer, Alexander Macdonald, aged 27, labourer, Ceorge Williams, aged 2.3, labourer, and Richard AJop, aged 26, blacking manutactuarer, were indicted for a burglary at the dwelling-house of Pinder Worth, at Scothern, on the 18th of May, and stealing therefrom 71. in money, 24 teaspoons, and other articles. Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., and Mr. Flowers conducted the prosecution ; Mr. O'Brien defended Jordan; Mr. Merewether defended Alsop; aud MIr. Bell defended Macdonald; Wil. liams was not defended by counseL Black pleaded " Guilty." This case has excited a very unusual degree of interest, not only on account of the formidable cbaracter of the at. tack niade upon Mlr. Worth's house, but also on account of the remarkablo bravery and self-possession manifested by the menLbers of his family, and especially by his eldest daughter, a young lady of great attractions, both mental and personal. It appeared from the evidenco of Yr. Worth himself, his 'Wife, and two daughters, that he is a farmer living at Scothern, that between 12 and I on the night of Sunday, May 17, he was disturbed by the noise of opening and shutting a door, and that, having caLled his wife's attention to it, he got out of bed ani looked out of the window. Hl then saw light reflected upon the garden from the lower windows, and went to the top of the stairs. Ho then rsav three men in the passage at tho foot of the stairs. Two of them had guns, and ,he third a light. lie called out " Holloa, what do you want ?" and the answer was, " We will soon let you see -what we want." The two men then pointed their guns Uo the stairs, and began to ascend accompatnied by four others. we retreated into his bedroom and stood against his hed. The six men followed into the room, and in addition to the two guns, one of which had something like a bayonet at the end, the men had a life preserver and a dagger about one foot and a-half long. They ordered Mr. Scothern to get into bed, saying, "If you do not, we will blow your brains out ;" and at the same timiie the guns were pointed at him. He then got into bed, and they demanded his money. He told them that all the 3noney he had was in his trousers pocket, and he pointed to the chair where they were lyilg. The men firsttook up the wrong pair, and, finding no money, -again demanded, with threats, where it was; and he directed thoum to another pair of trousers, from the pockets of which they took five sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and sorne silver. They then began to ransack the drawers. They also snatched at a watch-pocket at the head of the bed, and finding no -watch thero compelled Mr. Worth to deliver it up. it beisg secreted in the bed. Upon the first alarm Mrs. Worth had jumped up and run into the ne,xt room, where her four daughters slopt, and awoke the eldest, saying, " Oh, the robbers !" The brave girl instantly got up and rushed into her father's room, where she found tho six armed men threatening her father and demanding his money. She went up to them at once and implored them not to injuro her father. Her mother canmo back into the room, and was compelled to get into the bed, but the daughter remsained there watching with the greatest coolness and self-possession the proceedings of the burglars. Seeing herjewel-case on the drawers she quietly took it up, went with it into her owvn room, and put it under a linen chest, but somxe of the men observed and followed her, and she was consequently obliged to take it up again and, on returning to her father's room, to give it to oLe of the men, who opened it and took out of it, among ether things, a ring and a chain with a locket attached. Seeing the locket, she said to the man, ' Oh ! pray do not take that, as it has my mother's hair in it," upon whihli the burglar, with commondable gallantry, broke the locket from the chain and handed itto the young lady. Shortly afterwards two of tli men left to go into the next room, whereupon Miss Worth said to them, "Let mne go firt, or the children will be frightened." They allowed her to do so, and accordingly she proceded them into the roomii where her sisters were, and sat upon the edge of the bed while the nin broke open the linen chest and the drs wers with an iron instrument, and thoroughly ransacked the room. After a while, seeing that she was watching them closely, they m,ade her get into bed also, one of them cominag up to herand tbreatening her with the life preserver. Macdonald came to the bedside, and, drawing the handkerchief which was over his face on one side, looked at one of the younger daughters, and then wont away again. lVhiIe this was going on in the daughters' room a short man with a gun was keeping guard a' tbe bed. side of 3Mr. and MTs. Wo-th, but 3.e was r ot one of the prisoners; and after the room bad been compkctely ransacked some of the men wen downstairs to get refresiment, as they expressed it, and t3ere they niade free with the contents of the cellar, for, besides drinkilng in the house, they carried off with them a quantity of rortwine. Before finalUy leaving the house ome of the men shouted out, "If any one of you stAirs out of bed for an hour you may expect to bave your brains blown out;" and sliortly after the report of a gun was heard. Among the property taken from the house, in addition to the money and articles already mnentionedl, there were two dozen silver teaspoons, 11 table -spoons, three sugar bowls, a cream jug, a punch ladle, and soie electroplated articles. Several of the prisoners were identified by Miss Worth and her father aisd mother. Jordan, who was in the prosecutor's service 16 years ago, was particularly spoken to on account of his voice, which was instantly recognized by Mrs. Worth upon his interposing an observation dunng her exainination before the magistrates. Macdonald also wvas clearly identified by Miss Worth, and all the witnesses spoke to) the resemblance which Henry Black bore to oe e of the u en whom they had noticed as having been stuffed out to di,guise his figure. In addition to this evidence the prisoners wore connected ,with the burglary by many other circumstances. Shortly after 5 on the fol!owing morning Black and Jordan were observed coming in a directiou from Scrthern towa,ds Linco)en; and about a quarter of an hour later Alsop and Wil. blarns were also seen by another man comini in the same dlirection, and having wet and dirty boots. Williams, Jordan, and Alsop lodged together at an inn called the Swan and Sahlmon, and at about half-past 5 on the Monday tuorn. ang a man named Gray, wlio lived in the same yard, was invited to join Black and Jordan in drinking out of a bottle so00e liquid which he had never tasted before,-which was not porter, or ale, or gin, or rum, or brandy, or sherry. Later in the niorning, about 8 o'clock, Gray had sOniIC more of the same drink, the occasion of the festivity being, as be was told, Black's birthday; and when, shottly afterwards, Black and 'ordan were apprehended they were both fouind to he ldrink. Three keys, a gun, and a handkerchief were in BlIck's possession; and in Jordan's pocket were ts'o gloves, O0lo of which Aliss Worth believed to be her father's. After the apprehension of Black and Jordan, about 11 o'clock the same morning Alsop and Williams were seen by to-n policemen in company with a woman named MIary Brown, who was taken up before the magistrates bht dis. charged, near the canal side at Lincoln, and thev stated that as soon as the prisoners canght sight of them they retired behind a shed, and Williams immediately began to tbrow into a pool of water there a variety of articles, the last of which was a jemmy. The .srisoners having been taken the pond was searched, and in it were found a watch, two gold chains, tbree rings, one brooch, one chisel, o0e Jemniy, and aLne skeleton keys. The watch, chains, ringq, and brooch were identified as the property of Mr. Worth, and the chisel and jeminy were proved to fit the marks made by the burglars upon his drawers, and chests, anid cupboards. The learned counsel having severally addressed the jury on behalf of their respective clients, The learned JUDGE summed up the evidence, and The jury found all the prisoners Guilty. 'revioui convictions wore then proved against Black and s sop, wvho was a tieket-uf leave mano and they were senented to penal servitude for '0 years. 'The other prisoners were sentenced to 14 years' penal servitude. CIVIL S1DB,-(13efore Mar. Justice CRESSWELL and a common Jury.) YAnNELL V. 1100DY. This was an action for breach of proutise of marriage, in -ePly to which the defendant by his pleas had no t only denied the rmaking of the prormise, but had also alb go'd that the Plainitiff and defendant had miutually agreed to exonerate .eachi other from the performance of t e poie Mr. Serjeant HxYes and i2i r. glowers were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Macaulay, Q O., and Mr. Boden for the defeandant. The plaintiff, Elizabeth Yarnell, is a dressmakrer at Ea-st J3uttertick, about 34 ye-is of age, said the defendant, who is about 27 years old, now lives at|Dorcaster biit until re cently lived at East Butterwick, he being capitain an d prt proprietor of a boat plying betweetn the twvo places, andr being in the habit of going with his boat back-wards and forwards from one to the ot,her. As lolg as about eight years ago an intimate acquaintance had becoTne established between the plaintiff and the defendaint, the latter of whom was frequent in his visits to the forumer, and not very particular as to the tinie of making them. Jane Yarrell, the plaintifi's ister, living with her parentg at Bishop's Nortou, deoosed to the frequent Visits of the defendant at the plaintiff's houEe, and also that she had several times heard bhia say thathe intended to mnrry the plaintiff; that two days had been fixed for the wedding,-one in Juily, 1853, and the other in April, 185G; but that on the days. fixed the defendant did not make his appearance. Maria Middleton. the plaintiff's aunit, a widow, proved that the defendant had once said that she should be the bridesaisid, and no one else, and that she had actually bough: a dress and i, bonnet on purpose for the wedding. That was in 1S53; and she b .a 8een the plaintih and defcndnt ogeheraslate as A Be h litf n e v ndalt togerms r ; bxL tb, aR.

AL" Mr. MACAULAY, on the part of the defendant, denied that the defendant had ever made any promnise of marriage. but be had, unfortunately, when he was only about 18, contracted sin imiproper intimacy with the plaintiff, which she herself had terminated in April, 1855. The expressions in the letters referred to an intimacy of that sort. and not to :ny proitiise ofmarrigo; and it wvas very remarkable that if a day in April, 1855, had been fixed for the marriage, and the defendant had failed to make his appearance, no allusion to the subject sbonld have been ruade in the letter of the 29th of that month. The defendant's aunt, who lived next door to the plaintiff at Batterwick, was called, and proved that the defendant used to visit the plaintiff at night, and that one morning after he had been there all night his father and uncle came after hbm, and the plaintiff denied that he was there, but that he was discovered concealed in a closet. Another neighbour proved that in April, 1855, she heard the plaintiff and defendant quarrelling, andthat the plaintiff said, 'You may go out aod never come in any more, for I don't want thee ;" to which the defendant replied, " Well, well, don't let everybody hear." Mr. Serjeant IlAyrs having replied, The learnaed JUDGE, in summing up, commented upon the singular circumstance that there was no reference to muarriage in either of the letters, and that if the days were fixed, as had been suggested, there was no evidence of such necessary preparations as the publication of banns or the procuring of a marriage license. The jary retired for a short time and then returned with a verdict for the defendant. IIIrD V. DAVY. This was also an aceion for breach of promise of marriage. Mr. Serjeant Hayes and Mr. Flowers wore counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., and Mr. Boden for the defendant. The plaintiff, Savah Bird, is the daughter of a farm baili'T, and the defendant is a farmer at Ulceby, about 40 years of age, and a man of some property. It appeared that about Tune, ISa5, some sort of intimacy sprang up between the plaintiff and the defendant, who were in the habit of frequently seeing each other at the house of a Mrs. ioothby, who lived nexct door to the plaintiff's father and mnother. klary Hird, the plaintiff's sister, deposed that she had often seen them together at Mr. Boothby's, and that defendant had said he would have her sister. On one occasion in October last her mother sent her there to fetch her sister, and on that occasion defendant gave her a kiss. The witness said, ' Oh ! you shock me, Mr. Davy,;"to which he answered, "Never mind, we shau soon be of the same family." In Jane, 1856, the witness was at homae alone, and defendant came and asked her when she was going to be married. She said, " Oh, MIr. Davy, it is your turn first." He asked her then when she was ready to be a bridesmaid; and she replied, "Any time." He then added, "Bicause nte and your sister will not ba long before we are married." On one occasion she gave him from her sister a parcel containing her likeness, an orange, and some sweetcake. She had seen him sit on her sister's knee with his arm round her neck. The intimacy was broken off at the latter end of last -year. Upoun cross-examination she said,-I never heard my sister say she would Dave one of the Davys. I have seen her sit on his knee, and seen them kiss each other, and I believe I hasve heard her say to him, " Poor lad, it's time he had a i wife ;" but I did not hear Mr. Boothby say, " Ab, but he won'ts have you ;" or my sibter add, " You don't know that, SIrs. Boothby."' Other people were present on these oocasione. The learned JUDGE asked Mr. Serjeant Hayes whether he tbought the case ought to go on? MLr. Serje?snt HAYES.-This sort of thing is not unusual in that station of life. (Laughter.) The leatred Serjeant then asked the witness whether it was not a very u1;-al thing at Ulceby for people who were engaged to be iuarried to sit upon each other's knees. Thewitness made no answer. Mr. Justice CnESSYwLL-You know she was Tery much shockcd. Mr. sbrjeant EIAYES.-Yes, my Lord, but she may know the custoiII of the country. (Laughter). Mr. Justice C19SS WELL.-The custom is sometimes varied by special agreement. (Laughter). Mrs. Boothby was then called, and she stated that she was a very old friend of the defendant; that he used constantly to come to her house, and sometimes send her next door to fetch gingerbeer, which the plaintiff's mother seld, bat he never sent her to feteh the plaintiff Tho plaintiff came with the gingerbeer, perhaps thiree or four bottles, and then they used all to drink it together. When asked what she had heard the plaintiff and defendant talk about she said, " I am hard of hearing ;" but she had seen her kiss him, and sit upon his knee, though she had told ber that he would no mlore marry her than he would marry the witness. After this evidence the plaintiff subimitted to a nonsuit.
ROAM R flTPWTTT'I MAIDSTONE. J,r.v 94 Tho commission for the county of Kent was opened here on Thursday, and this morning basiness was proceeded witih in buth Couats. the Lard Chief Ba,)n presiding on the Cvnl side, and MIr. Jubdice Willes in the Crown Court. Tho gaol calendar is not nume ically heaij, butit containsaarsat many very serious eharges, there being no less than five cases of murder. On the Civil side 22 causes are entered, niie of which are to be tried by special juries. CROWN SIDE.-(Befo're Mr. JustiCe WILLES,) George Campbell, 38, etgine-fitter, was indicted for feloniously catting and wounding William Ward Cruden, with intent to murderhim. Mr. Deedes conducted the pro3ecution. The circumstances of this case were of a very extraordinary character, and the learned counsel for the prosecution in his opening statement to the jury said it appeared to him that the only questionthey would have to consider was whether at the time the act was committed the prisoner was in such a state of mind as to be responsible for his condact. It appeared that the prisoner and Crnud'n, who were entire strangers to each other, were coLmmitted to laidstone gaol on the 10th of July, 1&16, the latter for deserting his family, and the prisoner was committed for seven days for wilful damage. On the way to the prison the prisoner talked in a most incoherent manner to Cxuden, whostatsd in his deposition before the magistrate, which was received in evidence, he having died since the occarrerce, that he considered the prisoner at that time was not in his right mind. On the following morning the prisoner and C.Eiden were in one of the wards of the prison, and a man was engaged in repairing the floor at the same timne, with a basket of tools by hint the prisoner, without saying a word, weni' to the basket and took out a sharp chisel, and he tben rushed at Cruden avid stabbed hi:u twice in the breast with it, at the same time exclaimnng, "I don't mind dying, so that I can murder yon. One of the turnkeys, named Simmons, immediately ru3hed upon the prlsoner and secured him, and the prisoner coolly handed the chisel to another turnkey and said, " I demand to be t3ken before the governor or the surgeon for having stabbed tli4 man." He was then taken to the govern r, who ordered him to be placed under restraint by had-iog his arms strapped to his bodv ; and wheni this had been doae the prisorier said, " What a thing it is for a young man in the ptinie of life to be committed for seven days P' The e appeared to be no doubt that at this time he wds certainly insane, and he v;as shortly afterwards removed under a warraot from tho Secretary of State to the County Lunatie AsSlum, whera he has remained until withia: the last fe v days, when lie was brought back to Maidstone gaol to take hig t ial upon the present charge. The above facts were all proved by the witnesses, and a statsment omade by the prisoner when under examination before themnagistrate was also put in,which was to the effect that he viYhed it to be understood that what he had done was done purposely, and that his reason for it was that he was under the impression that he should be lilled in some way, such as being smothered, or else that his person would be cut land he should bleed to death, so that at the coroner's inquest it might appear that he had destroyed himnself. The prisoner said nothing when he was caUed upon for his defence. kir. Justiee WILLES, in summing up the case to the jury, said he wagclearly of opinion, notwithstanding what had heen stated by the learned counsel for the prosecution, that there was no evidence to justify them in acquitting the prisoner on the ground of insanity. The law had been dlstinctly laid down that before a prisoner could be acquitted, upon that ground it must be shown that he was not aware wh:.t he was doing at all, or that he was ignorant that he was commuitting a.n unlawful act, or that he was acting under a delusion, cch as .'hsat the part.y heattacked iotended to destroy him, and the act oF violence was the conseqnence or a part of the deluon. In the present instance it appeared to him that nothia g of the sort was proved and therefore the only question. the jury could legally take into their consideration were wvhether the prisoner intended to mnurder or to do grievous' bodily harm. MXr Harrild, theo assist:t-surga n to the gaol, said he thoeght it rigbt to inform.hi Lordhin that a message was ronslet when the prisoner wasreceiveat the gaolthat it would be adv isasble to wutch hi*. as he m.s considered not to te of sound mind. His own opinion undoubtedly was that when he saw him immediately after the occurrence he was invane. Mr. Ju.stice WILLs asked Mr. Harrild whether he undertake to say upon his oath thae at tho titui dould was committed the prisoner did not know ws - the act doing, or that it was a wrong act. t he was Mr. Harrild said he had no doub,t tb.At at the time the act was committed the prisoner was in, n.ne Mr. Justice WILLES said that thi' kind Of evdeno as frequently given, butt it was adc.;i of evndence wat efett.T)- cr1ption (if evidence that he would not give effect to. .e question was, did the pisoner at the time the act w'p4 committed know that he was doing an illegal act or not' Mr. Harrild said, he ,ould not take upon himself to ansrver the quesetinn. The case was tbOea left in the hands of the jury, who i after some deliberation found the prisoner GuWy of wooundinig with i'*rent to do grievous bodily harm. Mr. Justice \VILLES said he would make some inquiries before he pasied sentence. No case of interest was disposed of on the Civil aide.
IRELA ND. THE POTATO PLIOIRT. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPO.NDFENT.I DUBLIN, FP.iDAY MiO.NLG. Another southernl paper contains an unpleasant sitatement regarding the progress of the old disease in that quarter. kegretting the disagreeable task of heralding bad news, the TVateiford Mfail says the fact cannot be concealed that the blight has made fearful inroads within the Iast week " The first appearance which we noticed was in the nei,hbourhood of Ardniore, where nearly a mionth since the blight was unmistakeably seen; it gradually has spread inland from the seaside, and the stalks of the por4to in more than one half of the county are blackened and withering. The tubers also show the disease, and some fields have been ploughed up and sown with white turnips. The potatoes which are brought to this market are of large size and excellent qaslity, bat towvards the coast nearly f*r*hird large enough for masrket have to be put aside for cattr, as they are unfit for human food. WVe learn that the blight baa also shown itself along the sea coast in the coanty of Wexford, and has been spreading into the interior" As a cheering set-off to the checkered accounts from three of the southern counties. there comes the following satisfactory report from the northern province. The Bannwr of Ulster says:- "Our potato lands coxtinue-to exhibit aU the luxuriance of the former days of that national esculent, and, thanks to a merciful Providence, the appearance of an extensive yield is of the brightest character. Now, at the end of the third week in July, the markets are well supplied with excellent potatoes, at prices ranging from 6d. to Is. the stone. Not a sign of blight has yet appeared; even the most diligent searcher for ' signs of the old malady ' would fail to discover material for a doleful paragraph on this subject. It has been observed that the potato fields this season are sbowing a greater blow of flower than has been usual for the last dozen years. In the autumn of 1847, and for several seasons afterwards, the usual feature of blossom was hardly ever seen, and even where the plants did make an attempt to put forth a flower they failed afterwards to produce the crab, or natural seed ot the potato." "tiAN1b(JBNUES OF THE MAYO PETITION. Two of the parties-Michael Carney and James Murphy-who were convic-ed at the Mayo Assizes of the brutal assault uipon John Gannon, one of the luckless witnesses on the part of Colonel Higgins, were brought up on Wednesday to receive sentence. Carney is a boy of not more than 17 years of age, and his companion in outrage is not much older. Baron Richards, in an impressive address, said,- " The unfortunate man, the subject of yoar violence, wds summoned to attend a committee of the Hrouse of Coi e ons for the purpose of giving evidence. In obedience to the summons which he received. Gannon attended the comn- snittee and gave his evidence. Itis not for ine to say whether I his evidence was true or whether it was false-I kaov nothing about it; butl am far from sug-esting that he stated anything that was untrue. I should hope that he said nothing that was not perfectly true; and it was his hounden duty-as it is the daty of every man who is called npon to give evidence in a court oE justice -to tell what he knows fearlessly, and independently, and without regard to the consequences, or how far hsiS testimony may affiect other persons. Gannon came to this town of Castlehar; he went nto it on the 7th of July in consequence of business vwhich he had to transact-and what occurred? EHe was hunted like a wild beast from street to street and from house to house, and at last, when the unfortunate man took refuge in a smith's forge, ho was assaulted by clods and stones. He suffered violence of all kinds-stones were pelted in at the windows, in front and in the rear of the forge-and to crown it all, you, Michael Carney, took a bar of iron and thrust it into the unfortunate man's eye- "The prisoner Carney.-Well, my lord, I did not. "Baron RICIIARDS.-Such a case I never heard of in my life, and you aggravato verv considerably the misconduct you have been guilty of by thu course you are now taking. I repeat that I regret to see two young men in your inelancholy position, and I regret also that it is my painful duty to pass upon you the heavy sentence I am now about to au. noonce. However, we mus' preserve the lives, the liberties, and the feelings of those persons who, in the discharge of a public duty, may say things that may not be agreeable to you and may not he agreeable to o'bers. The sentence of the Court is that you, Michael Carney, being convicted of a riot and affray, and also of a malicious assault, be imprisoned for a period of two years and kept to hard labour. James Murphy, I dist:ngiish between your case and that of Carney; for, although you were very violent, I do not think that your violence was equal to that of the other prisoner. The sentence of the Court is that you, James Murphy, be imprisoned for one year and kept to hard labour. " During the latter part of the learned judge's add-ess the prisoner Carney seemned to be greatly affected. When the sentence was passed upon him he burst into tears, and he was removed from the dock weeping bitterly."
