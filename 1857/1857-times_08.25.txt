THE INDIAN AUTINIES. The following is a letter from Lieutenant R. G. Arastrong, late of the 17th Bengal Native Iufantry .- " ALLAHABAD, Jusx 28. "I received two lettes from yoa aud a couple of newspapers shortly after I had been at Benares. I was then doing duty at the barraks, when one moming I was told that I should have to proceed on special duty that afternoon with a detachment of the 84th Queen's. When the order came out I was then ordered to accom.,any a detachmeat of that regiment towards this place, to assist in communicating with the natives, and procaring supplies for the men; in fact, was interpreter and quartermaster to the force. Well, in due time we reached Allahsbad, whea yesterday I was ordered to attend at the fort here and report myself and receive further orders, as my duties as interpreter were now completed, audI am glad to say I have saice heard that my services on the road have been spoken of most highly to th-3. officer commanding the 84th here. Well, when I got to the fort I was ordered to do duty with the Sikh regiment of Ferozepore here, which I have since joined, and, as the ounotr is now all round in a most unsettled state, I trust I may someday mpkemy name known bygallantry in the field and at the first vacncy may perhaps hold the appointment of adjutant In the corps, which will be my first step on staff employ. Sorry I am, indeed, that I have not been able to pass in the languages, and still more hard Is it that all chance of pasing is now closed to me, for the whole of India Is in such a disturbed state thet for a time all that sort of thing Is knocked oa the head, for every one now bas just enough to do to take care of his own life. The circumstanoes of the mutiny here have been the most disgraceful yet heard of, and, as it may be interesting to you, I wiU give you a short account of it. The 6th RegIment Nltive Infantry were stationed here, and when corps wera breaidng out in all directions this regiment volanteered their services to advance againstthe King of Delhi and his mttineers. For this, they were thanked, and told that their services wouldbeaocepted at the firstopportunity. This took place in the morning. On the evening of the same day, while all the offloers wero at mess, the alarm bugle of the regiment was sounded; these poor feUows, thinklng it was a disturbance among the villagers, rushed out at the door. The first was shot down, and the second, who I regret to say was a great friend of mine, received the second bullet, and fell dead on the spot. They were all knocked over by their own men, and only three officers out of the whole regiment escaped. Every house in the station, with the exception of one or two, has been burnt to the ground, and when we marched on the other morning we saw Allahabad In ruins. TwodaysafterlarrivedI wentwithacoupleof Queen's offioers to see the bungalows, and Imust say Inever witnessed anything like it before; every single thing was destroyed, every pane of glass smashod, even the canvass that goes over the pankah was torn into shreds. Such a wilful destruotion of property I never witnessed. A large quantity of things was founad in a village close by. They were all secured, and two days ago the plsce was burnt by us to the round. This is certainly, aud will, from all appearance, be a tedious campaign; for, besides the straits we are reduced to, the bad weather is setting in-viz., the rains. 1 am reguakrly rationed like a common soidier, get a loaf of bread, a pint of beer, a little sugar and milk, and a small plece of mutton, besides tea twire a-day, spirits and beer nly once, as also the mutton, for tea is given out at night, bukt, as several of us have been living together, we have managed to get on very fairly. Oade is now the headquarters of the rebels. Every single regiment has mutinied, and the country will have to be taken a second time, but this time by force of arms. The brave Sir Harry Lawrenoe has manfully defended the residency against the insurgents, but if assistance is not rendered him, and the people who have taken refuge within its walls, amounting to several hundreds, they wil be all starved out, for from the last accounts they have been obliged to feed on grain and sugar. They have next tzm nothing to cook it with,and no pots of any sort to cook it in. t is reported that a detachment of the 84th, the Queen's, who went over there from Cawnpore the other day, have been cut down to a ma, but this has not been con&armed. Thee re thousauds upon thousnds of natives assemble A there, and assistanoe wil have to come quickly, or not an European will be saved. There is a force of 510 Europeans and a detachment of my present corps going over to Cawnpire most likely on Tuesday morning, and mostlikelyIshall go withthem; at least, I hope and trust lt maybe mygood luck to be able to. These are stirring imes, They are hawging men up at Benares and here. besides several other stotions, sis, seven, and eight day. Mssionaries in this country have carrled matters too far, and nothing in this country is a native so tenxaious of zs having his religion meddled with. Education has also been caried too far. Educate a native and he becomes a horough-paed sooundrel. These are the opinions of men who are capAble of giving them." (FRomr A?oTTI!:ps OFFICnR.) AZIEGURH, JTuNm 23. I wrote to you from the other side of Gornckpore, both y Bombay and Calcutta, also on two other occasions, in the hope that one of the letters would reach you, and relieve you of anxiety concerning the fate of dearest K- and mysef. I told you that we lefb our station (Gondah) on June 11, satisfied with having escaped with our lives, and leavlng ourproperty behind us. K--and frs. C- had left us a week ago, as it was thought desirable that the ladies should leave before disturbanoes compoUed us to adopt the same pLan. I have not yet heard from K-, but only of her safe arrival in Luoknow, and when we left I sent her word of our course. I very much fear for the auxiety which she will suffer on my account, and of the effect it will have upon her health, We have been marohing, or rather flying ever sinoe the Ilth, going 20, 30, or 40 miles a-day. We first fo-und refuge with a rayak in Oude (Bustee), and then with one owning property in the Goruakpore district; we have stayed at different places, and marched as the reports of the state of the country led us to think the most safe route. Four days we halted at Bansee with the Raish, undetermined whither to proceed. Until we arrived at Goruckpore we had to undergo all kinds of hardships in the way of food and rest; we always travelled at night on account of the heat of the day. The food was of the most revolting description, and sometimes we got none at al, but had to be content with milk, bad fruit, and a few unleavened cakes; but r am thanuful that none of us have really suffered from this, though one or two showed symptoms of giving way under it. Were I not a great deal stronger than I was when in England I could not have stood it. In Oude, where we have only lived a year, the inhabitants were extremely disrespeotful; and we noticed a great difference in their manner on entering this, an old province. We were in Goruckpore on Sunday, the 19th, and took up thenoe the ladies of the station, consisting of the wives of three civilians and of A captain commanding there. These, fortunately, were only a few more than 100 in num. ! ber, but they formed part of the 17th Regiment who had been stationed here at Aziimghur, and had plundered the treasury and left the district. There was a distrast of these Sepoys, who, had they not been overawed by some irregular cavalry and some armed men belonging to a Rajah, would have mutinied also. At Goruckpore, through the kindness of the people, we were supplied with wearing apparel sffi. cient to carry on with for a few days. We left, as I said, on the evening of Sanday with an Immense cavalcade, compozed of baggage, carriers, carriages, Sowars or Irregular Cavalry, and a party of armed natives belonging to the Rajah. We travelled by torchlight, in dreadful confusion, as we were escaping for our lives through dlstricts where the population was hostile, and where Europeans had been previously mardered. As yet, however, we have got on extremely well. The escort of Irregular Cavalry, whom we feared more than any enemy from without, have hitherto behaved well, and promise to do so. We arrivod here last night-a prety civil station; It has been looted, the houses burnt and destroyed in the moeb disreputablo manner-the work of demons rather than of men. The Sepoys were content to plunder the Treasury, but the villagers around destroyed the furniture, broke what was useless to them, dismantling the whole place, even the public gardens, baths, 8w. The civilans left on the first appearance of danger; the prisou was opened, admitting to the world about 800 characters of infamny. An Indigo planter, whose property in the neighbourhood has suffered in the same degree, remained concealed until some assistance arrived, and now, while the civil oRicers are in security In Benares, is reclaiming the district fror5 disorder as far as he can; he goes oub to administer retribution in burning viages, in reascing people and property; his name In Venables, and he deserves the highest praise. So timid Ae these infamous scoundrels that, having conduoted themselves as fiends when they had none to meet, they oAW fly in all directions from his small band. .we March to-night on our route to Benares. Mloat likely wvg sha go to Gas2eepore, on account of the circusstauae3 d the road. If we meot with opposition I hope we shall b, able to defend the Maes and children, and to give a good account of our molesters. I hear all Is safe In Lucknow; they h4ve a strong fortri! victualled for some- ine. I look forward to soon marching I up thither, 'i4 Cawporo. I It threatens rain; fortzmate we have been that it has t*oi come on before, for dur bed has been always on the groun.4 Usually at the foot of , tree, soraetiwas on the sand q! a j river which we were about to ford, We hre pAssd tha Taptee and Goglia; now the Goomtze remains; then we meet the Gmges. (FnlOm ACIL SEVALiT,) ALLnks ABAD, Juze 23. Hene I am wfell andsafe, tbahks be to God,-who has umeroi folly preserved me and others from a orael fate which has overtaken many of our dear friends. We have had a trying time of it, but, as far as Allahabad is concsrned, all is well, for we have a large forco of Euro. pean soldiss, 'who would fight and beat off all creation if necessary, and which is being daily increased by reinforcements coming 'tp from Calcutta. We have been so b3wildered lately that I have lost all recollection of dates and of when I last wrote to yoa. We were incarcerated in tha' horrid fort from the 6th to the 18th of this month, and a fearful time we had of it. God grant that I may never pass such a time agaia! Better to die bythe sword fighting than toseesuch sights of horror and pan such a time of anxiety. I do not think that I told yoa in my last letter of the treachery of the 6th Native Iafantry, or of the fearful night of the 6th of June. I can hardly write it, so sad and miserable is the story. God, in His infinite mercy, preserved me from a dreadful death at the hands of the bloodthirsty Sepoys. Itold you iu ay lt letter that we were apprehensive of an outbreak on the part of the city people, and that I had taken up a position at the gaol ready to make a stand; that the officers of the 6th Native Infantry had all confidence in their men, though we had not, for now noone cau trust those wretched natives. Well, matters went on quietly enough till Friday, the 5th, when news of the disturbance at Benares came up, with a report that a number of the inkurgents were on their way to attack this station. On the same day an order came from the Brigadier at Cawmpore to "man the fort with every available European, and make a good stand." We non-military men were instantly ordered Into the fort, being formed into a milita under the orders of the oficer commanding the garrison. We slept in the fort on that Friday, the 5th, doing duty upou the ram. parts, and returned to the station the following morning, but orly for the morning, going into the fort ain in tho afternoon. At this time we had in the fort abou: 30 irvalid artillery soldiers, some few commissariat and magazine sergeants, and we volunteers mustering above 10 i men. There wreo also 400 Sikhs, and 80 of ths wretched 6th guarding the main gate I A great number of the Europan merchants and half-castes remsined outside, be lieving the report to be only a cry of " Wolf," and supposing it to be a false alaM. The report of the approach of the insurgents was false ; but, alas ! would that the poor creaturwe had taken advico and joined us in the fort ! Among those outside were poor Captain Birch, thi Fort Adjutant, a married man, poor fellow, wlth a family; IDnes, the executive engineer, who had the previous day resigned his appointment In the fort from ill-healtn, and had gono up to his bungalow. M\y pcor dear friend, Alexmader, of the L-regulars, was in a garden near the fort with 160 of his troopers. Two guns under Harward, of the ArMi lery, had been sent down to the river to gurd the bridge of boats over the Ganges towards Berare Hks, of the 6th Native Infatry, aud two little griffs* were aLo stationed there In oharge of two companies of that regiment. Well, All these poor fellows were out and we were inside the fort, through the mercy of the Almighty. We were told ofr on our guard and had laid ourselves down on our beds (thosewho were not on watch), when, about half-past 9, we heard firing in the station, and on the alarm bugle being sounded we ran up to the ramparts in breathless silence. The firing grow heavier, and we all thought that the insurgents had entered the station, and were being bea:en off by the regiment. So steady was the musketry, regular file firing; on. on it continsed, volley after volley. " Oh," we all said " those gallaut Sepoys are beating off the rebels," for the firing grew fainter in the distance, as if they ere, driving a force out of the station. But before long the sad trath was known. Harwa:-d rode in, bringing the tidings that the wretched Sopoys had risen, had seized his guns, and had marched them up to the station. He had escaped, and had rLu up to poor Alexander's camp, who jumped on his horse and rode up towards the lines, with as many of his men. as could be got ready; he had been caught in an ambush by a body of Sepoys lying in wait in an empty tank, and had been killed by a musket being plaoed to his side, blowing out his heart. His poor body was brought in liter in the night, and I gave his hand Is last shake, and shed tears over his last bed. The officers were at mess when the wretches 3ounded ihe alarm bugle to bring them to the parade, and shot them down right ad left ! Wretched murderers, may they r . celve their reward I Nine poor little ensis doing duty with the regient were bayoneted to deth in the messroom, and three of tho officers who escaped heard their cries as they passed ! Poor boya, who had never given offence to any native, nor caused dissatifactlon to the Sepoys. Pive oificers Wre shot belonging to the regiment, besides the nine poor boys. Biroh and Innes, with the sergeant major, in all 17 military men, msny merchants, and otberls were most cruelly butchered,-in all 50 Europeans fell tha night by the hands of the murderous Sepoys. The Treasury was plundered, the prisoners released from gaol, and the work of destruction commenoed. The whole station was destroyed, house after house plundered and fired. What a night! Each moment we expected the Sikhs would turn on us, and then.! . . . But the Almighty mercifully decreed otherwise. Wo disarmed the 6th guard, at the main gate, and found the villains with loaded and capped muskets, ready to turn out I What an escape wo had I Five officers came in, all having escaped in a wonderful manner-three naked, having had to swim the Ganges. We were all night under arms, and In the morning lay down on our cots sad ani weary, each moment expecting to be called up. The streets of the city are aboat hlf a mile from the fort, and during the four or five following days troops of the rioters were to be seen rushing from place to place plundering and burning. Day ad night we manned the ramparts in the hot blazing sun, and day and night the guns and mortars belched forth, throwing shell and grapeshot. tearing down houwes, ad scattering the demons wherever they were seen. We dared not leave the fort, for who knows what the Sikhs would have done if it had been left empty? However let us not breathe one word of suspicion against them, for they behaved splendidly, though they are regular devils We lived on In this way till the Madras Fusileers came up And then our fun began. We " volunteers " were parted off into divisions, three in number, and your humble ser vant was promoted to the command of one, the "Flag. staff Division," with 30 railroad men under his command right good stout fellows, every one of whom had been plUndered, and were consequently as bloodthirsty as any demons need be, We sallied forth several times with the Sikhs into the city, and had several skirmishes in the streets, when We spared no one. We had several volley, poured into us, but their firing was so wild that their bullets passed over and around us harmlessly. The flagtaff Was always to the front, and they were so daring and reckless that the "flagsbff boys" became a byword in the fort. Every rascality that was performed was put down to them, and In the end thevolunteersgotabad name for plundering. TheSikhs were great hands at it, and, in spite of all precaution, brought a great amount of property into the fort. Such scenes of drunkeunnss I never beheld. Sikhs were to be seen drunk on duty on tho ramparts, unable to hold their muskets. No ono could blame them, for they are such jolly, jovial feDlows, so different from other Sepoys. When We could once get out of the fort we were all over the place, cutting down all natives who showed any sgns Of opposition; we enjoyed these trip3 very nmuch, O pleasant it was to got out of that horrid fo-t for a few hours. One trip I enjoyed amazingly; we got on board a steamer with a gan, while the Sikhs and Fusileers marchedup to the city; we steamed up, throwing shot right anI lefi, tll we got Up to the ad places, when WIe went on shore and peppered away wlth our guns, my old double-barrel that I brought out bringl,,_ down several niggers, so thirsty for vengeance was L We firedthe places right and left, and the flmes shot up to the heavens as they spread, fanned by the breeze showing that the day of vengeanoe had fallen on the treacherous villains. The wicked 6th had marched out on the 7th. leaving two. guns, and a Mussulman had set himself Up in the city calling himself the agent of. the ing oF Deli, and calling on all natives, Hindoos, and true believers to masscre ill Earopeans, and many poor felloWs who badb inn iding fell into his hands and were murdered. At last, when reinforcements came up, we al marched out, drove the insurgeats out of tho city, took possesioh of it and the station, where we have remained ever dsnce in the Collector's house-about 20 of us; others are ih the pucka (brick-bnflt) houses that ware not burnt; and the Fusileers and 89th (Queen's) in the church. 3Every dy we have had expeditions to burn ond destroy disaffetd villages, an we have takenour revenge. I have been appointed chief of a cotnmsilslor for the trw of all nativ,, charged wlth effences against GBovernmnent and persons; day by day we' have strung u'p qighb;an&Sen inen. We have tfie powrer of life and death in our hands, and I awure yon we spare not. A very summary tral is l tht tkes place; the eondemued culprit is plaed under a treo withi rope rouind,1his neok on the top of a earrig, and whe*e it ue ncbt.,ld wwam off he wuhgs. 41 Jii nowr wreL.nd qnietw bat wb.ro smiling homaes onoe existed are now only blckened walls and desolation. My old houe ix in rcins-it had just been repaired for me-and my littl house into which I had moved for a sesaon is in thsi samestate. Ihavolost nearlyeventhing, though myserrants behaved splendidly, and saved aU they conld. Two tables, a few chairs, three beds, a few odd volumes of my dear old bdoks, and my silver is all I have in the world; however, my life has been mercifully spared, I thank God ! My horses I have saved ; I sent them to poor Alexander for safety and for use before the fearful night of the 6th when his Sowars rode two of them, and Old Smuggler saved Hrward's life. When he ran up to his camp he mounted him, and he dsahed through the Sepoys like an old trump, as he is. I have the good old be4st uder me every where, car. rying on the work of retribution. Now that we have plenty of men a force is to be moved up to Cawnpore to relieve the poor fellows there, who are hard pressed, being intrenched in a kind of made-up fort. The Commissioner, Mr. Chester, sends me as the political agent with the force, and I trust to see some service before I return, so don't be anxions if you do not hear from me for several mails to come; my kind friend, the collector, will write a few lines to set your minds at case. If we can beat off the rebels at Cawnpore it is probable we shall o on to Lucknow. where we shad have some hard ighting. I shall probably be away for a month. Fancy marching in the rais I they have just come on. If I can keep from rheumatlsm and fever I sha'nt care, for excitement enables one to stand the sun and fatigue wonderfully. At any other time the sun would have knocked us down like dogs, but ad this month we have been out in the middle of the dav, toiling like coolies, yet I never have been better in my life. Such an appe. tite! The whole country has been up, and frightful massores hAre been taking place aU over the north-west. We have not yet heard half the horrors, for the dAks have been stopped for three weeks. The poor Heary Thornhills have been murdered at Seetapore, in Oade, and nearly ill the people at out stations, but many reported dead have turned up. Robert Chalmers is here with me, having escaped in a wonderful manner with those of his station. He comes on to Cawnpore with us. I can write no more, as Iam juAt starting. My God blews you all] The following letter is from a clergyman:- " BANGALORB, JuLy 4. "I began writing you an account by the last mail of this terrible ontbreak in the Bengal Preddenoy, and I have determined to give yon a brief outline of what further has been perpetrated, as Englishmen ought to be in possession of facts, lest there shoald be any squeamishness about the punishment in store for the brtal and diabolical mAutinears. " We have had an awful time of it, I can ssure yon, though we ourselves have been mercifully kept from alrm or danger. No words can express the feeling of horror whieh pervades society in India, we hear so many private accounts of the tragedy, which are too sickening to repeat. "The cmelties committed by the wretches exceed adl belief. They took 48 females, most of them girls of from 10 to 14, many delicately nurtured ladles,-violated them, and kept them for the bae purposes of the heads of the insurrection for a whole week. At the end of that time they made them strip themselves, and gave them up to the lowest of the people, to abuse in broad daylight in the streets of Delhi. They then commenced the work of torturing them to death, cutting off their breasts, fingers, and noses, and leaving them to die. One lady was three days dying, They flayed the face of another lady and made her walk naked through the street. Poor Mrs. -, the wife of an officer of the - Begiment, at Meerat, was soon expecting her confine. ment. They violated her, then ripped her up, and, taking from her the unborn child, cast it and her into the flames. No European man, woman, or child has had the slightest mercy shown them. I do not believo that the world ever witnessed more heUish torments than have been inflicted on our poor feUow-countrywomen. At Allababad they have rivalled the atrocities of Delhi. IreaUy cannot tell yon the fearful craelties these demons have been guilty off-cutting off the fingrs and toes of little children, joint by joint, in sight of their parents, who were reserved for similar treat ment afterwards. "I told you how gallantly our Madras Fasileers-poor J-'s regiment-has behaved; 100 men of them, under Colonel Neil, killed 650 mutineer I saw a letter from one of the officers yesterday. He says that no imagination can depict the scenes he witnessed when he arrived at Benares. AUl the troops were in a state of revolt. They saved Benarea. The whole of the Bengal officers were paralyzed with terror and astonishment ; so Colonel Neil assumed command and proceeded to the most summary measure, cutting off whole regiments. All the ladies were crowdedinto one room, with wounded and dying men, and from the window the sight tha greeted his eye was s row of allowses, on which the energeti2 colonel wd hanging mutineer after mutineer, as they wero brought in. After restoring some little order at Benares, on went the gallant Fusileers towards Allshabad; thermometer above 100 deg.; 30, and even 40 mile marches; no supplies to be had; living on flouxrand water. On reaching Allahabad at night the whole cantonment was in a blae. The regiments had already mutinied, and laughtered their officers with unheard. of cruelty. The Sikhs had not actualy mutinied, but they assisted the rebel regiments in pillaging the houses of the Europeans. This Sikh regiment plied the fatigued Fnuileers with liquor, and the scene of dirt, drunkenness, and wretchedness baffled all description. The officers of the Fusileers went to the Sikh lines and bought up all the liquor they could, to prevent the men from getting it, and they bought chests of champagne, boer, &c., at four and eight annas(. andIs.) a-'cottle. Now I hear the indefatigable Colonel Neil is beginning to bring about some degree of order, and is hanging scores and scores of prisoners. 8ut we get very little official tidings yet. I am longing to hear more, for I do not hesitate to affirm that each day of delay places all our lives in some jeoprdy. "I know from the very best authority that the Mhomedans are plotting at this place, but whether they dare rise wM depend on how things go on in other place3. The events of the next three weeks wil be most momentousA At Madras the panic has been intense. I believe, too, that the fears are reasonable. We have at Baugalore a stroDg force, and the Madras Sepoys have hitherto proved loyal. There is one circumstance in our favour. We allow all our regiments to have their women and children with them in their lines, whereas in Bengal the Sepoy leaves his wife in his village, and is allowed to visit her for a certain period every year. Oar system, doubtless, is a great check on the Sepoys, as they know that, in the event of their rising, their families are In our power, but the Bengal soldier can roam at will" INDORE. We have received the following most interesting letter, wvritten by a native functionary, and describing the state of Indore after the massacre or flight of the European residents. It would seem from thii statement that :EIolkar was really loyal in our cause "Indore Palaoe, Jaly 8. "tRespected Bir,-At lsst the worst has happened at Indore. The two companies and three guns which have so long been at Colonel Dnrand's request sent to protect the Residency broke out into open mutiny on the 1st inst., and fired on the Residency-hoase. Colonel Darand, Mr. and Mrs. Shakespear and child, Mrs. Datton, Major Sbtokley, Captain Waterman, ad EIropean gentlemen, went away quite safe to.Lihore. "Poor Mlr. hMahon and Mr. Butler and some of the East Indian writers and telegraph people have had a severe loss of lives, after the firing began, Molabux and Sarroop. lWarain escaped to the town. I stood for a while, keeping all the baboos and 'tir families and the treasures with me, and sent his Higbinsss word that we wanted protection. Re sent out a few horsemen, by whose assistancs I safely reaohed the palace, and the baboos the town. Meanwhile it appeared that not ouly thoae companies alone, lbut almost adl the troops of his Highness, were disaffected more or less, for no one would go out to attaek the muti. Meers% among whom Sa3dut Ehan, Bkakbee Hafeez's son, ad taken tho lead The work of rapine and destruction lasted long, and the whole residency presents a regular scene of woe, The poor Maharajah was quite horrified. The troops told him it was a case of deen (faith), and they would not go against their brethren. ",There seems tohave been an understanding betweentthem and the Mhow troops; for, simultaneously with Indore, the Mhow regiments shot the good old Colonel Platt, Majar Harris, and a few others, and burnt some bungalows. The Rer. 0. Hamilton, Captain Elliot, and hll the other officer8 are quite safe. Early on the morning of the 2d the whcle of the 23d Regiment - and the wing of cavalry arrived at Indore, and put up at the Residency, together ,with their brother mutineers; the disorder that lasted for two days can hardly be desribed; servants were plundering their mastors, old retainers were shatnef lily revolting. not for ' dee/,' but actuaUy for plunder. The nuatineers dictated their own terms to the Maharajah, and, not satisfied with receiving all they wanted, they proposed to him the hard lemis of cnt4ing off and sending to them the head3 of a few p*orEnropeans and Christians to whom he had given protection in his own palaco, together with those of his ad. >vers wpho -were in the British or Kafirs' interest. Of these. inforitanately, I was one, ani Ramchuder, Khooman, a4d Gnnish, ind you can conceive his Highness's sitnation; bt it f rml denied to yietld to any such terms. On the th the genr plunder of the town of Indore oommenced; therel was no end of fright. Oarown guards began to ran. awy 'Fithw oar property, and the whoJe was eon.. fjsion.and wgroar. At last the Maharajak rode w$tls a very few of &i. a guarded. the pot,-and ' rFi og,vS ae saso c"le4 wbo 3Ie 21 beIo4 g hij then went to the mnutlneere eamp witL &handfal of fol. lowers, and told them in the-name of ' dea' to ceae plnuderingl He aid he would as long as. he lived never consent to give up hls 1uropeanproege4, dead or alive, nor those of his courtiers, and though ho knew his troops had deserted he would yet die mranftlly if they did not eease plandering. The rascally matineers had also philcoophers and historians among thomr; they reminded the Naha. rajah of his illustriors anoestor JeJsrnt Rao Holhr, that he ought yet to take the ' bambo' upon his shoulders and proceed to Delhi with them; that the star of the British in the Eat had ast, owg to their pride and fAithlessnes, and his Highness mnust not prove himself tobe a coward. Bat to all this harague his Highness made properanswers. He saidhe had no strength of his forefathers, that he did not think rapine and the murder of poor women and childrn a part of any religion, and that he could not therefore make a fit companion to them. He then cause home, and the plundering in the town ceased. On the evening of the 4th they plundered the British Treasury to the extent of 10 lacs, and with about six of the gns which had been given over to the mutineera marched on towards Dewar. The panic is yet great, his Highness endeavours to recover the guns and the Treasury, and has sent an attack, but I don't know if it wil succeed. His Highness Ix giving every assistance to the European offioer in Mhow fort, and about 12 las of the remaining and the reoovered tresare, with notes to the value of 24 lac, was sent to Mhow under a strong esoort, together with the European proteges, All the ring. leaders have gone away with the Mhow Brigade to Delhi; a great part of proprty has boen recovered. I went to ee the Residency ani my house yesterady, and I could not help bursting into iars to ase its ruins. So you see the fearful conequenoes of your leavlng Indore. The atthoritiea were told months before ths was danger, yet they eould do nothing. Last night a letter was reoelved from Captan Elliot, stating that Mr. and Mr Hutchiuson, who had fled in disguise, were caught at Amijeera His Highness immediately ordered 300 foot, 200 hors and two gans, under Khooman Sing, to blowup Amjeera; but, though the troops have marched, the report appears to be inoorrect, and Captain H- and party are all safe at Jabooah, Molabux having reoeived a letter to that effect. We have just despatohed runners to bring correct news. I am yet a*ve, but momentarily expect my head to be cut off, owing to old enmities and being known to be in the British interest. Pray do come out soon or hIalswa is gone; your presencoe is equal to five regiments, I can't write more. "I am, your obedient servant, " ONID SIXGEL "P.S. Should I survive this row I wil write again, but there remains very little hope; his Highness's troops are completely disorganized and dWiffeted. Major Timmins has gono again from ahifdpore, and Mr. Keating from Mundlaisir. The dely in General Woodburn's arrival hs been sorious." NAGPORE. Having observed that one of your correspondents, In allusion to the Indian army, speaks of the misfortune of leaving the great arsenal of Northern India without a guard of Europeans, I venture to trouble you with another cae in point within my own knowledge where the arsenal is entrusted to native guards. I refer to it rather to show the great danger we have recently incurred from leaving the Nagpore force denuded of a European corps since 1848, although, as any one may see, it is a central and most im | portent position, while the city of Nagpore, after the annexation at the death of the EBajah, ha been in a diaffected state. The arsenal, containing gans, arms, and ammunition, with large military stores of every description, is eablished 11 miles from our force at Kamptee, at Seetsbuldee, within hail of the city said to have a population of 80,000, some of the most influntial of whom have boen known to be conshatly intriguing against us. It is maost gratifying to know at the present crisis that the force is of Madras troops, comprising European Horse and Foot Artillery, but these last do not furnish guards for the arsenal. Close In front of its gateway Is the treasury of the province, which by the last accounts had 19 laos of rupees in hand. Sweing this to he the case, one may suppose the great and important prlzes these two valuable posts must have presented to the mutineers to obtin. It is true that both the arsenal and treasury are situated outside, and at the foot of the fortified hi of Seetabuldee, under range of some of the gUns; but the walls are in such a dilapidated state as not to bear the discharge of the guns. This having been brought to the notioe of the Supreome Government plans and reports were duly called for, and furnished, and 11,000 rupees eventuvly passed, to put the wals in order. Two yeas were allowod to slip away and nothing has been done, perhaps owing to the annexation of the province The following extract of a letter I have reoived will show how matters were pawing at Setabul- "July 2. On the 30th three native officers of the Irregular Cavalry were hung in preence of the troopsand an immense conconrse of people from the city. Our guns loaded with grape (ten guns) and port fires lit awed the multitude. The city and Suddur Bazar at Kamrptee are to be disarmed this week. The Irregnlar Cavalry were disirmed ast week. - and the others had a narrow emap e the signal for rising was to have been tho ascent of a baloon; somehow the balloon would not rise. Guards bad beeu poste to prevent flight into Kamptee. The river on the 24th wa.s higher tban ever it had been known at Kamptee. We are all well. -
TWH BENGAL ABTILLEBY. TO THE EDITOR OF TEHE TIMES. Sir,-During the Isat six weeks several extracts of letters from the correspondenoe of the late General Sir a. Napier have appeared in your columns, bht none, I believe, have referred to his Excellency's sentiments respecting the efficiency of the Bengal Artillery, composed principally, m you are aware, of Etropeans. At the time I reeelved tho letter from which the follow. ing is extracted I was in command' of the Artillery in Kumnaon, bordering on the lepaul frontier, and had occasion to report on the weak state of defences in our province, and at the same time invited the General's attention to other matters connected with the efficiency of the regiaenut of Artiery. Sir C. Napier replied thus ,"Simla, Nov. 5, 1856. "I approve much your report on the state of defenees in Enmaco, and though Junag ahadoor has told my wifein London that he lores me more than any man living, still as lovers sometimes quarrel, I should like to be prenared for hic, and your suggestions shall be pressed on the ittention of Government. ' What yon say about the defidency and frequent change officers with the reserve compaes of Artilery is but too true. I did intend, had I been able, to reform the whole system; but I am of no use-no more power have I than a lance corporal I believe, however, I have sucoeeded in moving the head-quarters of your regiment into these provinces, either So Delhi or Keerut Delhi is the station where Ishould desire to see Europem battalions cantoned but many say it is unhealthy. "Ken from all parts of Asia meet in Delhi, and some day or other much misehlef will be hatched within those city walN, and no European troops at hand. We shall see I have no oonfidence in the allegiance of your high caste mercenaries. I have seen a 'sweeper' show more ravery in battle than a Brahmin and a high-named Mussuiman A high-caste man cannot be attached to a Chrittian Govexnment. " But to return to the artillery. I think very highly of your officers generally, bue especialy of the young officers. When I have found fault I have invariably traced it to the 'system,' and I have vainly represented this. " There are many errors of system which a Commanderin-Chief sees, but cannot change. " The Governor-General takes two-thirds of the power which a Commander-in-Chief eught to exercise, mnd the Military Board take the rest I " I cannot change the character of this army, which is bacd and faulty as regards system of discipline, and therefore I resign. " Many of the old officers of infantry have been babit. uated to a bad system, and get into a routine of neglect from which the devil himself would not drive them. Look at the nightl 'nards in the Bengal army-the sentries ase alone, ad a the rest go to bed ! " The whole Bombay army does not present such an anomaly, and it arses from the ' system.' being bad. Still there are several very excellent discplinarians. in the Bengal army-men who take a line for themselves. Loek at Gilbert, at Whbeler,* at Huish, and a wcore of 6thers.

PA1IAMJNTABY INTELIGENCE. SOUsE OF LORDS, MoNDAY, AtousT 24. Uhelr Lordships met at 6 o'clock, 'The Barl of SUAETEl3SB1RY presented petitions from 'iMe inabbitanta of Isington and Croydon against Sunday I TH3E OPrIfI TRAFFIC. 'Te ILORD CIANCELLOR hnid upon the table the vopinon of the law olecers of the Crown upon a case sub. uItted to them with respeet to the legaUty of the tralo iu -.npxum carried on by the BFAt Irdia cou)pany ith China. ,le salid that towards the olore of last session the Earl of Shaftesbury moved that certin questions upon this subject rbould be put to the judges; but, as it was thought inex. ,;1dient to cousult the judges, the Gloenrment consented to -consult the law officers of the Crown, and a case was accordingly submitted to them, with the statement that their prinion would be laid before tis House. Lord ST. LEOXUARly did not object to the zrception af the paper, but deemed it unusal to refer to the law oticers of the Crown for their opinion. Lord CAMPBELL concurred in thinking it a novelty to obtaln for their lordsbips tho opinion of the law officers of 'lte Crown. It was not respeotful to the judges, who were -their lordships' constitutional advisesr, and he did n.ot ap. ,prove of it. (Hear.) The LOBD CEANCELLOR believed that by common .onsent it wzs thought inconvenient to consult thejudges npon a matter which might come before them jndicially, and that all parties agreed in asking the Government to oon-slt their law advisers upon tt. Tle Government oonsented, arnd undertook to communicate to their lordships what that advice was. Their lordahips vwere not bound to be guided 'iy It, or to give it more attentio than they thought it l6served. (Hear.) The subjeot was then allowed to drop. THE NEWS FROM INDIA The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH asked whether Her fjestyws Governmeuet had received any further informa. %4ion from India. Lord PANMJURE said nothing further had been received 1an was in the papers two days ago. The Earl of ELI.ENBOROUGH suggested that it would ibe convenient that the Go-verment of Calcutts, Madras, -or Bombay should find some agent, or some member of the -Government, capable of putting a few imporkant facts Into iclor and intelligible English, which should constitute the telegranhio despatch from the presidency, and avoid the confusion and ambiguity of the communications received -oar this and on formaer occasions. (EHear.) THE MILTLCA. The Earl of ELILENBOEOGUGH proceeded to recall the -attention of the noble baron at the head of the Wir Depait,uent to a subject upon which he offered somne observations -a few days ago,-namely, as to the number of militia who ,would be embodied under the vote passed by the House of 'Commous granting 200,0001. Icr the purpose. He understood 'thenumbertobe embodiedwssabout 10,000. Hewished tore. ,:mindthe noble baron that about 30 battalions were now trans. teBred to the East India Company, and the expense of their Tmay for six ronths vould be 450,000L Pour additional szeglments of cavalry were transferred to the charge of the Wpst India Company, and he believed their py foy ix months would amount to about 39,0001. From 2,000 to 3,000 Artillery were to be sent, and their pay for the six 'months would amount to 3Z0001. It was said that some :8apprs and Miners were to be sent, and he believed their Qry would be 8,000. during the same time. Therefore the revenues of this country would be charged 529,00OM. less tznhad. been anticlpate They wre at once relieved of the charge for 30,000 men, and the charge for the recraits who were to fill their places would come gradually upon the peblic revenue. He thought that the totul charge, allow. iing 1,000 to be recruited every week in the next six rmonths, -would be under 300,0001. There would remain 229,0001. -spplicable, under the clause in the Appropriation Act, to 'which the attention of their lordships wos clled the other -day. The noble baron would have the power not only of embodying 10,000, but about 11,000 or 12,000 more could t e pald for by the smrplus under the different heads of charge -which he had polnted out, and he ventured to express a fer. -vent hope that the noble lord would employ that sum In "be manner he had indicated. (Hear, hear.) Lord PANMURBE said that whatever might be the balance, ehether 200,000t. or 300,000., it would be applied to the -axigencies of the srvicee, either in embodying more rilitia -or In sending out more recrniting parties for the army. He -was happy to say that during the last throe weeks upwards .of 1,500 men had been recruited, and as the winter ap. Troached they would be able still more to augment the *axany. (Hear, hear.) In reply to Earl PolYis, lord PANM URE said that as soon as the necesary order 4n Council was made intimation would be given aa to wvhat regiments would be called out and embodied. The diswussion was not further pursued. LORD REDESDALE AND THE DIVOBCE BILL Lord REDESDALE said their lordMhips who were in the sfouse on. Friday last must remember the proceedings which ,then took place Ho did not wish at all to provoke any wngry feeling by reference to wbatthen transpired, but it was .zeoessaryinsomadegree to referto thedebateonthatoccaslon 'The whole question In dispute turned upon the practice of the House with regard tonotice. The practise in thatrespact wss not ruled by any standing order, but by nsage, which -r'as etill more binding. No one could be nore strongly con. -winced than he was, and no one oould urge more strongly than he did, that nothlng ought to be done without proper notfce. In the early part of the session Bills remaned upona -the books many days, and sometimes weeks, without any ,notice being given of proceeding with them. But towards the close of the ses3ion the tnme allowed for notices necessaily became shorter, although it was important that the greatest poEsible legth of notioe compatible with the pro. -ceedings of the lous should be given. When the daiys of the session were numbered there ought] not to be an hou's dela in giving notie of pro. cedings on a BilL If Lhe noble lord in charge of a particular Bill gave no notice, it became the duty of noble lords who took an interest in the Biil to discover I -whether it was intended to proceed with it or not. If it 'were to be proceeded with due notice should be given, and -it was perfectly in the power of any noble lord to propose .sot to proceed with any measure on the ground of the lateness of the session by giving proper notice of his inten. tion to raise that issue. Unless that was the practice of the Houee it would be in the power of any noble lord, -and partfcularly of the 4va=enk not to givo -motice of proceeding with a Bill, to take the Louse by surprise, Pnd to deprive any noble lord who -wisbed to take part in the discussion of an opportunity -of doing so. The course which be pursued with respect to the Divorce Bill was to give the-earliest notice -which he could of his intention to move the postponement of the con. -alderation of amendments for six rmonths, and he did it in a -manner perfectly courteous to the other House, because he founded his intention upon the late period of the session and the emall attendance of right rev. prelates who were nore especially capable of advising their lordp upon the -subject. But the notice was distinctly given by word of mouth and circulated throughout the wbole country by the public pre s. Again, to show that a summary proceeding of that -sort was not entirely without precedent, he might cite the case of the Muricipal Corporations (Ireland) Bill in 1836, -and the Registration of Mlectors BllU in 1838, In both of which a sinilar course was adopted. That the notice was regularly given he was perfectly confident; and, he thought be might point to his whole public conduct as a proof that Ee would be the last person -who would attempt to aot contrary to the practice of their lordships' House. (Hear, hear.) With respect to any notice ho might give he thought te was entitled, at least, to have the credit of being in -order. (Heoa, hear.) Bealdes, the Divorce Bi was not a party measure, though it was a Government one, and it had been rather supported than opposed Sey noble lords on his (Lord P.edesdale's) side of the House. Again, ib he was not jastified In the cours he had taken, -e mighteask what other eourse be could have pursued. Ia repeated that he thought the notice was perfectly zeasonable; and he added that the maner in 'ifch he wus presedinot only by one noble lord on the Ministerils aide of the house, but by many to withdraw his motion, was TainfultohimseIf persona ly. He did not believe that hose nioble lords in t-her sober jndgment would Approlre *kh 2uztbay tooa on that oceason, and be thouglt i w 4 -u to hmicl1 to rtqt&e spme ipubL; clnowlodgment to At effet.

That motion was objected to by his noble friend (Lord Iledeedale) ; but, supposing thLe oppoeitionh lad een pr-esse, and. upon a diviaAion, the sajournment had been negatived he was ata leow to know whether the no"s lord (Redehdale) would have come forward and taken the Bill ouit of the bands of his noble aud learned friend on the woodido, antd said to their lordships, "This is not the Bill of the noble and learned Lord Chancelor; it is a Governm*ent Bill, and I wiol take uon mystel to move that the amendments he considered e months hencew"lHe b not the saightest hesitation in acoeptiog the assUrance that his noble friend had not intended ny sarprise ; but he mutsy tthe same time, that the not: ,0 given by the noble lor had led the Goverament o su'ppos that he dil not mean to propose his motion until the Comtmons' amendments were brouht, In the ordinary course of froceeding,udertbeirlordship consideration.

He (Earl GraviUlle did not regard the subject at all in a grty light, but be was sure any noble lords who heard tfie notice, on whichever side of the House they sat must haye concluded thabt it would be brought forward when the amnendments were in the usual cours consfdere by their lordships. Oneor two noble lords on the opPoeite side felt there was a virtual smrprie, and pressed his noble friend to postpone hi.s motion. he (Earl Grnville) could only say that he had great pleaue in repeating the usean rance be had given on Friday night, thae he entirely c quittedi his noble friend of any intention to take the House by suwrprise. Lord 8T. LF.O1gA1R.IY thUgh th e only thing requird to complete the satisfaction with which their lordships had heard the statement of the noble eal was an expression of reZret for some observations which had escaped bim on Friday night Earl GRANVILLE could not expreme regret which he did not feeL When the noble lord announced his intention at once to take the sense of the House on his notion, be (Earl Granvile) mightl In tho excitement of the moment, have used expresions which yere not approved by some noble lords, bat he stated moet explicitly his confidence In the smuranee of his noble friend, and be felt upon calm reflection mhat he had nothing to reret. The Duke of ARGYLL ws not present on Friday night and he was very glad he had not been In his plac; bat his understanding was, that when his noble and learned lriend on the woolsack moved that the Commons' amendments should be considered, the noble lord (Redesdale) would move the postponement of their coesideration. He (the Duke of Arg3ll) had rranged to leave town onFrMdy, And certainly neither he nor any other member of Her Majestv's Government would have done so if they had had the least Idea tbat his noble friend meant tobring forward his motion on that day. Thq LORD CHANCELLOP said his noble and lrned friend (Lord St. Leonard's) had expressed a wish that his noble friend (Earl Granvijle) had withdraw some expresions which mighe have been considered offensive. He (the Lord Chancellor) did not believe any such expressions were used during the discusaion; but his noble and learned friend (Lord St. Leonard's) alluded on Friday night to some observations which fell from hiat (the Lord-Chancellor), and which might, perhaps, require explanation. He was perfectly satisfiedthat his noble friend LordRedesdale) didnot intend any " trick; " bnt what he said was that if the whole .Bill should be, to use a vulgar expresion, "burked" by such a motion as that of his noble friend, the feeling out of doors would be that it had been done by a "trick." ThAt opinion he expressed on Friday night, and he was now prepared to repeat it. The noble lord (ledesdale) had explained what he considered the proper mode of proceeding in a case of this kind, and hbad referred to two cases as bearing upon tho question; but he (the Lord Chancellor) would ask whether ilL either of those cases the motion waa proposed not by the promoters of the Bill, but by its opponents ? (Hear, hear.) That made all the difference - for in some instances when the promoter of a Bil receive; it back amendedfroeithe Houseof Commonshedidwithout any notice move that the amendments should be Immediately taken into consideration. His noble friend (Lord F-edesdale) had much greaer experience than himself in matters of this kind, but e (the Lord Chancello doubtedI whether there ever was an instane in which hen a Bill introduced by the Government had been brought up with amendments from the other Hiouse, a member who opposed such Bill had moved at once that the consideration of the amendnments should be postponed. His noble friend cer. tainly gave notice that when the Divorce Bill came up he would move that the amendments should be taken into consideration at a future tien; but, knowing the candour which characterized his noble friend, he (the Lord Chan. ceUor) thought his intention was to bring forward that motion when the amendments came before their lordahbi in the ordinay course. It ws true the tems of his nobe friend's notice entitled him to propose the motion at tke time he did, but according to the usual course of proceeding it could not have received such a constracton. Lord RBDEZILBE mnst remind their lordships that when he brought forward the motion of which he h given notice no proposal had been made for considering the or. mons' anendments on Monday, and a get surprise would have taken place it the amendmcnt bad been brought under consideration without notice. W-ith regard to what had fallen from the noble earl opposite and the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, he (Lord Redesdsle) thought he had reason to complain of the tone in which he had been addressed the other night. When he found bis notice had not been understood as he supposed it had been, he consented to withdraw it, but he must say he thought he had not experienced that courtesy froru the noble and learned lord on the woolsack and the n6le earl which every peer had a right to expect-namely, that he ought to receive credit for being aztnaited by honoubr6le motives until the oontrary was shown to be the cas-. (Hear, hear.) If the noblelords to whom he had refered had clImly stated their opinion that his notice had been nisunderstood, and he had then refused to withdraw it, the langaage used might possbly bave been justifiable, but before anytbing in his conduct justified them in doing so (hear, hear), they certabinly addressed him in lagngage which he had felt, and which, as a gevnleman, ho could not but feel. (Cheers.) Lord CAMPBELL was understood to say that the noble lord (Redeedale had been solemnly warned on Friday night that the general impression among members of their lordships' bouse was that his motion would not be brought forward until the following Monday. Having great respect for his noble friend, he (LordCampbell) earnestly implored him to abstain from pressing the motion, but the noble lord per sisted in his intention. Lord REDESD&LE-I did not make the motion. Lord CAMPBELL said, certainly the motion was not made, but the adiourment wasobjected to, asdhe had been surprised that after the noble lord was Informed the debate would be taken on Monday, and that his motion was inderstood to apply to Monday, he had pereiatd in the course he pursued. There wsa no doubt that the noble lord conscientiously believed that he was regular; but certainly he had no reason to regret the course he finally adopted (hear), for if he had persisted in his orignal purpose, and had thrown outi the Bill by that; umnceave, he would have dosne what in theV lawwas called "snappi ajuadgment, which was always set aside with indignation by the courts until further inquir was made. Ths Marquis of BATH was indispoed to refer to what passed in private conversation, but be must say the tone and language of some of the noble lords on the Ministerial side were such that his noble friend could not have done otherwie thn tret them with the contempt they deserved. "ea, hear," and "Oh 1") Lord DUNGANNON said he certinly never witnessed in their lordships' House such a scene as that whlch had been referred to. It exceedea anything he had ever observed in the wildest days of the Eouse of Commons. The rasing of the hands, the ejaculations by the noble lords opposite, md the cry of "This Is the Chairman of Comroitgtes"were m"ore wortby of another plAce than the highest asembly in the land. (Hear.) The Commons' amendments to the Lords' amendnreaU on the Bauril Aota Amendment Bill were consddered and agreedsao.

Lord .REDESDALF said he felt it his daty to ppoce that these amendments be taken into consideration that asy six months. He trtd it would not take lQng to explkin his views on the subject, but at the same time it wa neessary that he should enter a little into several points 4rhich induced him to think th their lordahipa ould not pre sent tUke the amendments into consideration. Tho Bill was unquestionablv & meaure of tho greatest imnporktaue but it was not one of grest urgenoc. Ee would state three grounds on whioh he thought that their lordshlp ought not to proe d with the consideratign of the amendments. Tho first depended on the oharacb r of the alteratiexqJ made in the Bill by the House of Commons. In the seownd place when it WAS recolleowd what had eccurred during the sent sen their lordahie mngsht lairly be of op nioi- that grE"t ad,g e 70 would arse troml ving the aountr uATbsr time to express its wIsheg en thb subject; and teti onaLderationwbilthiLnoedisi=aakatheotion whioh h6 had kivenn6tice *s, tbetin somepecutiarwatteruirespeot to thia Bill the relief whikh as aupposed to be obti"tr& wa' not obtined. With re6pect to the amendment smade ty the Com2nonaskeehoulddeteintheirlorajip.vey 2hortly,except on one or two points. With respect to the alteratio ni ma by the enlargement of the cour, he did not regard that as anaterial change either in one way or the other; and hlI would now advert to the first important alteration-namely, the introduction of local jurisdictirn. Here he took a very deoided objection both as to the prinoiple introduced and the manner in which that principle waa canied out, a weU as to the loual courts proposed to be constituted. The Bill proposed that the sentence of judicial separation might be obtained by the husband or wife from a court of asaize or quarter sessions. Now, be thought that the court of quarter sessions was the mnost objectionable that could be selected for the purpoie. The provision would introduce into the court of quarter sessions7 where all the magistrates of the country mlight assemble, something like the trial of the action for crim. con. He thought that their lordashipe must feel that an introdao. tion of this nature was most unsatisfactory and objeotion. able. There was no resson for bringing in that local court. It might he requireda hereatter; but, in his opinion, such a jurisdiction should not be introduoed except on good and suficient grounds, and he did not think that an adequate reason was to be found in a mere abstract vote of the House of Commons tbht there ought to be local jurisdition. To adopt such a provision as this in regard to the court of quarter sessions was, he believed, In the highest degree inexpedient and inopportane. Re thought that the appointment of a6 second ludge would have been preferable to the introduction of this new court, and he could not approve, therefore, this amendment of the Commons. CIAuse 24, providing that in case of a judicial separation a wife should beoonsidered as a feme soic for the pur ies of coan tract and suing and being sued, hAd been struakout-why, be could not understsnd, beecuse it appeared to bim to be a necessary provalon. At the tase time he would not exi press any very poeitive opinion upon the matter. The next was a very important alteration, being the introduction of four new causes for whicbL a wife might sue for a divorce; and in this respect he thought that the amendments introduced by the Commons were essentially erroneous. The first newc greund was adultery committed in the conjugal reaideuce It appeared to hiim that that proposition was open to the gravest objection. It was intended, no doubt, to meet the case of a man bringing a mistress into the house and allowing her to sit at reals with his wife and to mingle in their general society. It was doubtful whether such a case might not come witbin the category of adultery coupled 'with such cruelty as would entitle the wife to a divorce; but, if it did not, he did not think thst it should be mlade the seprate ground for a divorce, because It mnight enable the wife, when so disposed, by puttig temptation in the eay of the husband, to effect the object which she had in view. The next ground waa rape, but he thought that rape was an offenoe rather against the wooman ravished than against the wife, and that it might be left to be dealt with by the ordinary law of the country. He objected, there. fore, to the mtroduction of that cause, The other two causes he need not characterize with snore particularity than to say that they conitemplated offenees which were of very rare occurrence, and that the introduction of them into ap Act of Parliament which would come into the bands of females and all classes of the community was objectionable. The next alteration vas very important. One of the get object nwhich theirlordabips had in view in the arrangement of the Bill as it went down to the Commons was the aboli. tion of tIre ection for criminal conversation (hear, hear); but by new clause inserted in the other House tbat action as, In point of fact, reintroduced, for it provided that a huband might claim daamages on the ground of adultery committed with his wife. One of the main objections to the action for criminal conversation was that, by awarding dam , it estmated tho wife's loss by a money payment. The new clause provided that the claim of every such petitioner should be heard and trled on the same principles, in the same manner, and subject to the same rules and regulationsas actions for criminalconversation were now tried and decided on in the courts of common law; and he contended that that was a revival of the action for criminal conversa. tioni (lear, hear.) He knew that It 'wa said, inanswer to this objection, that the court had power to direct In what ,mannerthedamagesrecovered shouldbe applied, and that it might direct them to go to the maintenance of the wife, or towarda making a provision for their children. Even so, he thought that the money did, in point of fact, go to benefit the husband, for if it went to the 'wife or the children it spared him the neceesity of making them such an allowance as he might otherwise feel called upon to do. At all eventsa, where there were no children the argument could not hold good, andthe damages-recovered by an ationwhich wa to be carried on precisely in the same manner as an action for criminal conversation-were to go to the husbnd, u there were any vaid objections to the provision as it went down to the Commons with respect to im. posing a fine on the adulterer, he thought that it might easily havo been amended without tVhe revival of the action for criminal conversation. (lear, hear.) He came now to a claume which he thought open to very grave question-that by which clergymen who consden. tiously objected to marzy the divorced parties were still required to urrender their churches for the perfornanoe of the cerereony. It ws said thatpersorns in this position who desired to obtain a religious snction ts their union would be sabjected to inconvenience if they were not allowed to be remarried In the perish whera they, or one of them, resided. But such persons might go before a registrar, and then might proceed to any parish in the kingdom where they knew the. clergyman wa willing to perfornx the ceremony, and there be re married according to the forms of the church. Instead of this, however, the clause Insorted in the Bill allowed divorced persons, contrary to the will of the incumbent, to intrude themselves into any church provided with a clergyman who entertained no objection to uite them. For such a provision there was not the slightest ground; all precedent was against it; it introduoed a principle the consequences of which could not be foreseen; and he trusted, therefore, that their lord. ships would withhold their assent from this clause. Ho had now gone through the principal - provisions to which he enteTined objeotions. But, Independently of these objectlons, he thought the consideration of the Commons' amendments ought to be postponed on account of the limited time allowed to their lordsaipe for consideration, aod on that ground alone. It was, too, not their lordzhips only, but the public who, requirediuther time. Extraordi naryas it mighIt appear, thiasubject had never been seriously considered by the people of this countr untU within the lest few months. He was inclined to believe that the country was not fully aware of the probable consequences of this Bill until it seemed likely to pass through the other House of Parliament, After the measure was sent down from this House a petition of a most Imporint character was presented, signed by several thousand clergymenurepresenting almost the whole of their body; and it was impossible not to conclude that these reverend persons, though they might be thought to be particulaly interested in the subject, had been obliged to give it a hasty oonsideation. This fact afforded a pretty good instance of the small regard which people in generd, had paid to the question, and the ueceseitT ot fur ther consideration. When they looked at the increasing number of petitions presented to the House of Commons up to the last moment against the Bill it was evident that people were only jut awakening to its probable effects, sud he tought, therefore, that preoltitaty to h urTy forward a measure which affected every household-a measure for which the"r wasno immediate neceseity, and which was not called for on any urgent ground-was not doing uztice either to the country or to Parliament. (Hear, hear.) Auother ground of objection to the measure was its extreme imperlection. (Hear.) One of the great arguments urged in favour of Its iutroduction was the expensve and anomalous nature of the proceedings now nzwessary before Parliament. Butnco provision hadl been made to meet the case of divorces in India, and in such cases exceptional Bills would still have to be passed. (Hear, hear.} Then. 4agin, the Bill did not apply to Ireland. { dear.) The Probates Bill-a sister measure, upon whzich and upon this Divorce Bill the Government rested their credit as regarded the present sedon-was extended to d. Why was not tk same coarse pursued with regard to this Bill Where was the difficulty in the way? Certaiuly none arose out of the machinery of the Bill. It was solely on account of the late period of the sesion that the proviiona of the Divorco Bill were confined to England alone; that was to say, the measure, for want of due time for consideration, would be an imperfect one; and probably in the next session of Parliament they would vave to deberate again on the eublet owing to this hurrioa, immature Pieteo eltto (Hear ) He hoped that on a question of this nature, which so deeply concerned the welfare of England, their lordahips would not proceed with unbecoming haste merely to suit the conveutence of Parliament, but would give it that earnest andgraev attetion which It demanded. (Ohee,) Beieving that it could not this session receive adequate consideration, he moved that the Commons' amendments be taken into conslieration that day six months. Thc LOUD CHANCELLOR said, the nobI lord In sap. port of his motion huA addressed to their lordships argw. mants founded on a variety of consIderatous; hut, with all respect to the noble lord, he begged leave to say that tho greater portion of his arguments had no reference whatever to the question whether the Commons' amendinehta should be taks into ConaitldentiOe the Or ftht daY aii Mtn but to the question wrhether those amendments were im7 provements or otherwise, or to the question wleth r t&dr lordsh ought to hbve read the Bills third time.

Now, that was a tter which their lprd sbips wero perfe*ty compeent to deal with, beouse the; ba,diready3 Taturely conidered it,The ue.tpointto which his noble friend 0votked was the extension of : rildtion In granting' disolaton of marrie at the Ins taes'o>the wiife, whhickhad beie vegbia*en rdsnen irets ithe oalier Hous. As tho B declie it passedom4hei lordships' to the other lHone,-divor6e could be o'etalnsd by ,the *if in two osea, and ,hs House of Comfons had sub. stantlally only added a tibrd i atse of- divorc6, for with xegrd to the other cauze wblh had,eeix imAOrt by the . , -; ,,~ , ,, :,n: .- e -rXcr, f -" .¢ @- -! i* Comnons-;amnAly, nnatural offenree-their lorahips did not include that cause in the gill, because tey did not Wish it to be defiled by any reference to those offenoes, and because tbey felt thA accolding to ancieot practice divorce would be granted for an unnatural offence. With all deference to hisnoble friend, he thought it was most Absurd to object to their lordshbps proceeding to consider the amendments on tbb ground that one of those amendmenta provided that 'he conimsmlon of offences of a disgusting nature should be a cause for divorce, because it was notlikely that applicationL for a divorce on tbAt ground would be made more than ornoe in & century. The Commons had inserted an ansandnt vining that If a husband broughta mistreSa to reside ,ith him fn the same house in which he dwelt with his wife, the wife should be entitled to be dirorced from him. Whether th%t amendmert waa well expressed was not the matter whioh their lordships hLd at present to discuss, but he could not believe that they were not then competent to diouss that question. Ths next amendment to which his noble friendi mhadverted wasthat relating to the clergy. That alteration =Jgbt or might not be an improvement, but surely It was not to be contended thAt their lordahips were not then in a condition to discuss that question on which they had already had, foux diviions, on eaoh of which occAions they camo to a partioular conclusion which had not been adopted by the Commons. Thero was then the question as to the abolition of the action for criu. con. Hie was one ot tiosewho did not see his wvay to the abolition of that action, for he felt that there might be instances of great pecuniary loss by adultery, and he could not thimk that it was altogether aafe to aboli6h that action without giving some substitute. Their lordships, however, came to an opposite conclusion, and thought it ought to be abolished. There was a great difference of opinion on the subject, and although the House of Commous had not actually restored the action of ceri. con., they had done what was almost tantamount, with the exception of proyding that the money to be recovered might be settled, if the court thought f6t, for the use of the wife or of the children of the marriage. With respect to the church, what the House of Commons had said was that they yielded to the scruples of the clergy to the extent of saying that they should not be bound to marry in the parish chnrch, but that the church,which for many purpoecs was the church, not of the clergyman, but of the inhabitants, should be used for the solemnization of marriage by any other clergyman who did not object to the marriae of divorced persons. Thairlordships would have to consider,when that part of the Bill came under consideration, whether they ought to sanction the compromlse thus made by the Hoase of uommons. The other House had inserted. an aamendment to the effect that on any question that might arise under this Bill an appeal might be made to their lordships' ouse. That amendment would have to be discussed, not now, but when it carue in due course under their consideration. If, then, ali ihe amnendments made by the Commons were such as their lordships were perfectly zompetent to deal with at once, then the argument of his noble friend for delay plioceeded upon an entite fallay. His noble fiend. said that the Bill was imperfect, becaus among other reasons, it did not extend to India. The law of marriage was pre-emiinently a law of domicile, and it was extremely difficult to legisate in onae doaiolle, as it were, for what applied to another. India on all such questions sbould be allowed to legislate for Itelf, and if it had not now the requisite power to do so then it would be for their lordships to grant snuh a power. It was al.so Eail that the measure did not extend to Leland. 'Unquestionably Ireland ought to be considered if a Bill could be introduced; but it was found impracticable to legislate in regard to that country in the present ssion more especdaly as thls was not a matter like that of probate, in wbich precisely the same laws that were apted to one part of the kingdom were equally fitted for another. There might be many peculiarities arising out of the state of the population of Ireland which would render necessary important deviations from tho legislation applicable to Eagland. That was the reason why the abolition of the action of crim. con, was confined to this country. It 'was next allened that a postponement ought to take place to give furtner time for the consideration of this subject. How long would it require to make such a question ripe for legislation? It was now nearly 10 years eince a Iioyal Commission Irrasied toinqire into it. The most distinguished men, irrespective of garty connexion, were selected to conduct the investigation. ne of the most eminent of their number was Mr. Walpole, who concurred in the recommendations oi his brother commissionerS, and yet that right hon. gentleman was neither an adherent of the present Government nor in say way chargeable with being o pposed to the established church, Vice-Chancellor Wood, another of the coamissloners, was probably very different in his political leanigs, yet no one could doubt that he also was an ardent and stanco friend of the church, and a man who would never consent to anytbing which he thought ealculated to 'weaken or injure that sacred institution. The Government bad announced more than once that a measure would be introduced to carry out the suggestlons of the commissioners, and a Bill was accordingly brought iu in 1B54. and passed that House The measure was revised early in the present session, and after lengthened deliberations it bha received the apjprobation of both branches of the Legilature. It was aid, indeed, that these amendments camne up very late in the ssdon, but what wAs the meaning of that assertion ? Could It be pretended that there had been any dela In introducing the Bill? It had been introduced. t the earliest possibleperiod. He hadhadtwoBillstobrin in, the one latig to probate, the other to divorce, and he had taken the first day left vacant by the discussion of the former measure to lay the latter upon their lordehips' table. A month having been occupied in considering it, it then went dorn to the other House, where, was soon as the state of business would permit, it was taken up and debated day after day and night after night with tha most praisewothy pertinscity, and ultimately it received a third reading. Under such circumstanoes was it reaFonable to allege as a ground for postponing the 'Bill for Eix months that the amendments came up to their lordihips at too late a period to be duly consldered ? If such a doctrine were to prevail the result would be that no inortant measure which had undergone the fllest discussl,on in both Houses could ever become law. He iperposely refrained from entering into the merits of the cdffrent amendments. The p-oper time for doing that would be when each particular amendment was before their lordships; and he should then be prepared. to givebhis ieasons for aslhng the House to agree to them. But on the question whether their lordships would now entertain the subject ax all it was to be honed that, seeing there was nothing newr in the amendmrntnta.othing that had.not been already more or less directly discussed by that House -their lerdships would reject the preposition of the noble lord and allow those amendments to be considered. Lord SL. LEONAIX S said that the question beforo the House was no t what were the merits of particular amend. ments, but whether, their hours beingnumbered, their lordships had sufficient time for the due consideration of a series of as important alterations as any that were ever made in a Bill Pent down to the other Chamber. (Hear, hear.) He had been anxious to know whether the noble and learned lord on the woolsack was prepared to maintain the Commons' amendments as they stood, and it now appeared that he was so prepared. I that were reall so he should be compelled to vote for the amendmenS of his noble friend (Lord Redesdale). Nothing could induce him to take that course 'but his firm persuasion that the only alternative open to their lordships was either to ccept or reject the alterations which the other House had made in this measures and not to consider them as carefully as their importance demanded. They must recoUect by whom this B had been pasted, and how it hadzreached the Hobse of Commons. It had been carried by the votes of a Isrge number of noble lords, whose opinions were entilod to the greatest deference. Great consideration was due to the absent. Those noble lords were not absent from inattention'to their duties, but because they had no reason to beheve that such important amendments rwould come up from the other Houme this yea. The leaned lord on the woolsack had defended the Government in regard to the period when this Bill was introduced; but nobody had found fault with them either for not introducing It earlier or for not pressing it forward in this or in the other House with greater vigour. No one had a right to complain of the protraeted discussons which the measure had provoked in the Lower Chamber. But, althouagh nobody might be to blame in this respect, that did not alter the fact that the hours of the sae3ion were numbered, and that the time at their disposal did not permit of the examination of these most important amendments with the attention they tequired. The measure in subetance and effect had beex wholly chang d by the ordeal it had undergone elsewhere. Hear, bear. Those alterations touched the constitution of ge court originally proposed by the BilL To the grounds of divorcepreviousy recognized by their lordehips on behalf of the wife other grounds which were entirely new had been superadded. The provisio in regard to the sction for brim. con. hai lo been extensively modified, and there had likewie been a relaxation made in the law in favour of the clesy In al h s innocence he must declare that, whatever might be the view of the learned lord on the wooback, the clerg eyaufse,in his opinion, had no necessary donnexion with the easure.

The tendency of recent legislation had toa mucLh been to give the judges power to force parties to go to a arbitratioan at great cost and with much delay. The jing would say with truth that he had to open the comtInsnOLte f',llo wing day at the next asaiz town, and that he had not timue to. heakr a divorcmae. A week, in fact, would not be too long wvith aU1 the aids and appliances of counsel pratised in the law for the examination of one of these case of divorce; but where were the oocunal upon ei cait, or even the ledges, who knew the law by whiceh the promeedings in -such cases oughLt to be guided? He remem. bored in the old Hlouse of Commons that Iii smone police Bill it was prord by an hon. rmember that the watotmen should go to sleep in the d aytimae in order to ba prepared for wratching at niight, whereupon, it was suggested that the vpatelbmen. would he miuch obliged if thelhon. memberwould -put it in the Bill." (A. lauigh.) Parliament was in like rranner now asked to put something upon parties whidhhit was not reaosinable to call uponL them to do. The juages Iof Assize were lastly to appoint somse Queen's counsel or sarieoat-at-law who was to benamed inthe commission, and who would then be competenit to try these cases. Whoever framed khis part of the Bill must be content to be told that it would not work. It was itnpousible, !ndeed, for any mana who was conversant with the matters which would come before thewe courts to say that the Wilt wgould work. In certain Cae a I ppe wan given from thesea local courts to th ir f arage, so that a poor man would be dagdt~og acorse of litigation, and would end, wherehouhtobgn at the ms.ris.ge court.

Thus %he suitor woud be compelled to pay the 4cost of the jadge who was to try his cause. Ho should sfuggest toHrMjet' inisters that they sbould not preess h luerltn to the question of local jurssalction, inamc asiwas a point in reference to which nio dvisiou hdbe taken in their lordahips' House, butt tathys oul onsent to its rejection Upon the perfect unesadn ht that cour.e h.d ot been taken uapon tsuesoftepeosto,ad with the viewr that a separate Bill ohoudb ruh in next session for the purpose of catrrying noefc h objects which the advocates of the clause wore anxious to attain. Tenexat point to whIch be should advert was that which related to the question of thLe extension of the numiber of the pounds upoa which a woman would be enabled to obtain a divorce Tre subject was one which had for a, long period occupled the attention of their lordehipe, and a, Government ameaure bad in 1854 been introduced into that Hrouse, in which only two grounds had been set forth as conferring uporn the wife th, sigh's to demantd a divorce, thLose two grounds beinl bigamy and inoestuous adaltery. The question whether thle. commissioni of a rape should be added to the list had Indeed been considered when the Biil had corne under the noties of the House in commwittee ; buLt after mature deliboeration the adecson had been arrived at that that offence should not be held to ounstitute a sufficient cause for granting a divorce at the suit of the wife. There had, hiowever, been no rmention mnade upon the occa&ion to which he referrea to those aisgusting ofencess to which his noble aLnd learned friend onx the woolsaek had alluded as happening only once In a centuary, and he could not help concurring In the observation which had emanated from thxe commrissioners who h&a been appointed to inquire into the subject of divorcea, to the effect that there were cases against which it was not fitting that any legislative enactmnent should provide. The very rarenes of their occurrence rendSered, in his opinIon, anly such enactment nunncessary While he thought it was desirable that no mention hould he made of them in a Bill which would be in the hands of the purest women in England, especially when it w&s bornie in mind that thae laW as it sood afforded a remedy against those by whom they maight bo comamitted. (Hear.) But passing from that point he wished to cAlltheir lordships' attentioxunext to thatprovision which had been Introduced into the Bil by the _House of Commaons saneLing adultery upon the pat of tho husbsan whben it took place in the conjugal reiWdence a ground entitling the wife to obtain a divorce. In accrdance vwith the law of France, the fact of a mauls living Withl A coDncubne in the conjugal, residence constituted a ground of divorce; hut when, -he would ask, did such a state of things occur in thiscoDuntry ? Very rarely if at all, and even if it didtako place it would be acawe of adultery, ac-companied with dircamsanceaq of so cruel a nature as would justify thegrat'n o-f a divorce a m4ensd et thoro in ou eclsati:calcurts The clause in the BUil dealing with the subject was one which, in his opinion, would be fou-nd to be prodnotive of great mischief. The offence against which it was inxtendedd to provide~ was one which must no dotubt be viewed with the utmuost abhorrence, but he could not help thinking that it was oue In reference to which thema was no necessity for legislation, while he should contend that the proposed legis. lation maight lead to very injuLrious consequencew, ag', for instance, in the case 'of a wife who was anxious to get rid of her husband, and who mighLt with tha.t view place in hls way an intriguing chambermasid, who might induce him to forget what he owed to hinmself and to society, and cause him to yield to temptation to which he had bceii designedly subjected. (Hear.Hedidaotmeautoexenuatetecormmsgonot such an offenceo, but then he maust say that it was one of a rmuch less grave nature than many others in relation to which the Bill contained nio provision whatsoever, while he might add that a select committee, of their lordahlps' House had refusged to assent to anly PropositionL ma=gith,a3grouind of divorce against the husband. WhnteBl passed thirough their lordships House a clause had been introduced, the effect of which was that in the cas of any petition being presented by a husband for a divorce on the ground of adultery the court should* have the poe f inflicting a fine on the adulterer and coinpelliogintopay tbe expenseso the huisband. Now, the other Houseof Parliament had struck out the words relating to a fine, and had confined the operation of the clause to the payment of costs, while another clause had been introduced abolishing the action for cnni. con. But what was t-o be the substituLte for the a"ton for crim. con.? Why, a husband was to be allowed to petition for i divorce or a judicial separation, snd to claim danmages against the adulterer, and the action was to be conducted iccording to t'he same form of procedure and under the seine rules as the p resnt action for crim. con. Now, wherein did the duerff exist? (ERear, hear.) He had read the clause 50 times over, ead was utterly unaible to see any distinction. (Hear, hear.) Well, then, akgain, it was said that a man was disgreacd by receiving a money compensaton for his own dishonottr, but the Bill as it at preent stood not only providied. that an injured husband should receive a mone comenstion, hut also that p art of the damages awarded might Cbe tote'd bythe court for te benefit of the children or the maintenance of the wife. Now, therewas no other instance known. to the barof a,court kaving ipower to dispos of a fine as they might think fit. For his own part he looked upon the clause as a most monstrous one. (Hear. ) It was said that many persons would rather touch a scoreion than the money whicha they might receive as damages in compensa-tion of their diahonour, aLnd that statement had been freely uised against the acton ~for crim, con. but yet the present Bill not ontly p resided that -a man might receive money coamensation, bot also thaat a portioa of the damages might be Allotted for th6 benefit of his children. (Hear, hear.) He would wrish also to say a few words upon another mnost importanut subject, No man hadl a greater respect than hle had for the conscientious feeling of the clerp, but at the same time he could not approve a claiuse m the Bil which appeared to him to contaiu the principle of placin the clergy above the law of the land. (HEoar, hear.) If th e l were in Accord- ance with the law of God, whT shoulAd Any excePtion be mnade; and,if not, then he would implore the Govern ment to attend to the voic, of the right rev, bench. It had been enacted that parties mnight go before a. registrar andaconutract a civil msarTlnge, withoumt having a right to any ceremony of the church, hutL by the same Act permission. had been givent to these per-ons to havetheirmarriage celebrated by the church, and an option had been eivau t the clery maLn to perform thLe ceremony or not, as he pleased. The allowance of thi option was a most dangerous step. He himself should have thought that if persons had contracted a civil marriage, and desired to it the sanctionof the ohuro'n, the clergy would have been most anxious to have admit thems within its pale, and so far ma they were authorized to sanction the union. (Hear, hear.) He very much regretted the provison in this respoct which hW been inttoduce?einto the BFM. Row he should vote in rerard to it wais, however, another question. He must respect the ecosldeuce and the convictions of the persns uas aeonceesion to whomnti " prorissonlied been introduced, and while hi maust take that o'sportunity of expreasiunu isregret at its intrduston, iadhis determinaon so long asbeeescupled % seo.nteaao um nlageyoioi et the kw onea to pe of any clu of Her Kalles' iubiecu, he-WMAot Prepared t ay that Itho uld aoteaslni%-bhi almendme.

A-,±t reAllY is a fiction, that becauri officiall wa r mothing of what passes in anter po w iberefore perfecly ignorant or all that ba h pened in regard to this Bill, up to the premt saoment I apprehend that the noble and learnied lord on the -woe5sa6k folly Ehowed you that those are points of auoh a aatusa that, although they involvr separate amendments, a&yioe lord who takes an interest in the question hl hLaden acapl opportonity of making himself maser of their merit, At the same timue, while I think that tese-tso noble l6rdt loolc a most legitimate and, perhaps, :usefeul con;se Is gjt4 nic, fauly into the demerits or the diasdrantagee'f eaih of thlp, amendments, still, as I apprehend that the ' before the Ilouse is whether we shall consider theme seaendienits b once or postpone their consideration for six xaonthsiihIc of course, means indefinitely-I do not feel mytd}f obligdd to follow-those noble lords point by p6int. I napirehed that if the amendment is'carried there aiend4 te Bill for this session. On the other hand, if is not osarrld I prememthatd oblelords opposite4donot co sder at thtt deciion ulil dispose of the whole question. Shey will then. bring forward each of the amendments to which they obje9t to be caret nlly considered by lour lordlsips. (Hear, b:64 BTherefore I tbink it would be rather a waste of tlnsiIti were to go over a line of argument whichx mus be repeated at a subsequent stage. There was, however, onl argument urged by *be noble lord who inov*d thi sntiment which had no great effect upon my mind. That iW& as to the advantage of ventilating public questions; Ah * general rule I think it is iLopossible to ventilgte qu".- tions too fully, to answer- them too eautiouily. oe to give too much time for taking every pssUble opinion; but I hardly remember any Bill which has bee, more carefully aud conscientiously dieussed on both -idea, and both in this House and in another Place, than this meusure has been. I must also say that am not certin that there is not an advautage in nsttling delicate qua. tions of this sort, involving so auch with regrd to our social habits, instead of leaving them to be handled in every possible way, some of thoec wAys being, I am qaite certain, roductive f disadvantage. It may be a metaphysicl rginent as to the motives which induce persops to comwt these crimes, or ic may be that an opening 'i gien to persous to consider what scruples can possibly be excibta, " have been excited, with regard to the clergy-in this ?espec I ha's no doubt most conscientiously felt, ut till much la have not e7isted for a long time, and such as have not beeiL raised without a certain amount of agitation. I do not think that any forther sdvantage will be obtained by leving tbis quesion a a bone of contention for soime indefituib peri of time. Therefore, if for no other ron than thaa should request your lordathips at once merioely to apzt yourselves to the consideration of these amendments, wbl I do not admit are such complete cbange -as they have been represented to be. With regard to the latenes of the session, that we can only answer ia cooiwxlou with the question wbether the House is in smch namber as to be able to comider this subject, and I have hardly Over seen the House so fo1i on botb sides as itis tonight, Inua add that if it is true that we we to-night not to have the advice of some of the most important meoaber8 on the other side of the ouse, that aes from no-dereliotion of their duty, as it would do if they absented themselves from any' motives of personal convenienoe, bot from the fact that on this point they generally agree with the Goverment, snaf therefore do not think it worth while to appear in their alces to-n' it (Hear, hear.) I therefore iope that your Vordships l negative thi9 mnotion, and at once rooCed to the oonsideration of the amendments which have oen md in this Bill by the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of CARNARVON contested the statement o,f the noble earl that this Bill was asbstahtially the same as that sent down to the Houe of Commons. He had aken the trouble to make an analysis of the clause* as they noi stood, and he found that of 73 59 were either new or had unde one alteration. Five had been struck out, and 21 hao been added by the other House. 33 had been altered,-19 materially, and 14 verbally, or in other minor respects. It was therefore incorrect to say that this wasthe same Bill which their lordships had oonsidered aready. Earl GRANVILLE presumed that among the canei changed the noble earl had include d those wicirrelated to the title of the court. Their lordships then divided, when there ppeaed- For the motion . . . 46 Against it. ; 44 Majority .. -2 The amendment of Lord Redesdale wAs consequenYt The Commons' amendments relating to the fitle and constitution of the court were agreed to. On the daue establishing a lotal jurisdicti n ei s of judicial separtion, Tho LORD CHANCELLOR briefly narrated the hisoto of the clause. It was tbought, he sid, by -the Homo of Commons, and especially by members not connecte wit the Government, that there ought to be loa tribmnau for the trial of petitions for j udicil separation, and that partier residing in the country should not he compelled to *pply to the general court in London. Hence it bemcme neeeary ta conseder to what local courts the jur4diction shoulid be intrustedL He did not pretend to say that the tribunals mentioned in the clause were free from objection. but at the sune time he did not think it would be posible to hit upon better local courts than the judgea of uizsse and the qukrter sessions. It had been said thattie judges of aosize were always soextremely pressedfortimethattheysad been. in the habit of }saig, 'This cas will occupy too mush. time; it must be postponed till another occasion, or decided in some other way" Now, with an experiene of llyeus as a judge of ssize, he must say that, elthougl he had oftez heard that that was commonly done, be inever saw it done, and he believed it had been greatls eggerated. All difficulty could be guarded against by ues and re.ulatious to be framed under the Act, one of the first of which would necerily be that etitions should he presented a sufficient time before the holding Of the ii thatth judges might be aware of what buiness there would be, With respect to the quarter sessions the ;ouseof Con mons had thought thit, as they were seig toprofij a remedy for the poor, it would onb be consistent to e st tribunal which would be really accessible. Thre raw was no ground for asserting that the courts of quart sessions would not be comapetent to dischage theaiew fun tions that this Bill would impose upon them. The magistrates composing those courts were men of station, t quainted with the habits and feelings of the humnblefclasee and they would be quite ablo to dea 'with tte casbes c divorce which would come before them frota those classes. He did not mean to cohtend that the tribunals propo6e were not open toobjection, but the sme could be sad of any tribunal that could be suggested. The question now was whether the amendment made by the other H1 -as sO open to objection as to induce their lordshi s to atfee their assent to it. He belleved it vas not, tnd tha neither this nor any other amendment which had been introduced in tse other House had at all altered the-chrcter of the BilL For those reasons he should request their-lordships te concur,in the *tnendment of the other Ifoufe. Lord. MO[ TEZ&GLB sadi e felt suchatrong objectlonst this amendDDent that he oould not absain -ftrom expressing them. When the Bill was first introducedthe noble anct learned lord on the woolsack told hims it.was not ihtended to alter the principle a the law, be buts"Pl to improve the tribunal which atnisered it. Had. the Bill been confined to thr.t objoct, it would hevq been well, but as it stood at present it would lead them 1it* innumerable difficalties. Confininghliftliftorthe moment to the clause undle± consideratito, he would askbtheir lordships whether they thought it provided improved trlbunals for dealing with subjects of divorme, He bslieved it not only filed to improve the ,xisting tti6disa bat by soome ingenious alchemy it extracted all-thatwas badfrom thi old system and added thereto al1 the elemrest of .misohiet rhichanewtribunloould possiblypoess Of theopodtiod to refeirtheso matters to the Ludges ofai- hae; would say nothing more than that if etw duti& eremnposed upon. those judges it would cast grestdiflcoaltyintbe performasce of their public duties.

HOUSE OF COMMONS, MONDAY, AUGUST 24. The SPRXAz took the chair at 3 o'clock. Petitions were presented by Colonel SYExs, from the Harbout Commaisioners of the Burgh of Regality of Fraser. burgh, in the conuty of Aberdeen, praying the House to take into consideration not only their claims for assistance to enable them to complete the works in hand, but also that Frsserburgh may be made a harbour of refuge; and they further pray to be heard before the Select Committee on the Hasbours of Refugoe; and by Mr. EI snY, from the Board of Guardians of the FulhamUIJnion, DS to the levying, &C., of THE ANN WIISON. Mr. COBBETP asked the Secretary for the Colonies whether he had received any information with regard to an emigrant vessel called the Ann Wilson, which sailed from the port of Liverpool on the 29th of November last for New Zealand; particularly as regarded the alleged overcrowded state of that vessel, the short supply of water, provisions, and medical comforts on board, and the fatal effects that ensued ; and whether any inquiry had beon or would be madeinto the facts? Mr. LABOUCHEBRE stated that no official information had been received from the colony on the subject to whtch the question of the hon. gentleman related, but the attention of the Government bad been attracted by a atatement in the newspapers, and the Emigration Commissioners had written to their officers at Liverpool for the purpose of obtsining such information as they could give them. Itappeared from what these officers had stidthat the Anu Wi on was measured for 186adults, while shetook out only 169. He could not but think, therefore, that there had been soine misapprehension as to the alleged overcrowding of the vessl. He was informed, likewise' that she had the full quantity of water on board, aad that the provisions underwent the usual examination. However, as soon as the ship returned to this country stejs would be taken to ascertin the facts of the case, and if it should turn out that the owners were to blame the full penalty would be exacted from them. THE GERMAN UEGION AT THE CAPE. Sir D. L. EVANS aukdl whether the German Legldoi Eettlers at the Cape of Good EHope were at present in receitt pf full pay s troops embodied, or the rate of pay specified i the army estimate tor thi year; and also, what was the pre, tent numerical force ofthat corps of all rankss ? Mr. LABOUCHERE said,d he believed the Governor at thie Cape of Good Hopce had thought it right to call out the German Legon to act as soldier.s, anud therefore they w ouldl be now in receipt of ffilpay. That step would enable the| Governor to furnish ahlrger reinforcement to India than otherwise would have been the case. The total number of iien comprising the legion was about 2,300.

COMMWUNICATION BETWENM LONDON AND DUBLIN. Mr. CORRY-asked thl Seoretary to the Tre3sury whea met1e tWrms of thxe ontraot for iaproving the communal,atioon between Loidon-And Dablin had buenfinallj iettled; md, if so, whetber the contract had bean exsecued; *so what ateps the Government had takeis towar4s providing suitable accommedation agd the necessary appliances for the ombarcation and, lauding of mails and passengers at Xingstowtn nd llolyhead.

I2r. COItRY inquired 'when the neew arrangements were Aal come into operation ? I Mrx. WILSON sid the longest time accorded to the com. zeiaie was two -year, but ho hoped so long an interval would nt benecesury. However, as there were four ves"es of large dimensions to be built, and extensive arrugementa to ib completed, it was obvious that some delay mwut tak3 place. Sir D. NORREYS asked how many years the Treasury had been engaged in bringinS about the present arrange. inent? !We. WILSON replied that the Act of Parliamnent under which the arrapgement had been concluded was pased in the session of 185. Within six weeks of the close of that sesson a Treasury minute was issued, with the object of inducing the companies to co-operate with the Post-office in adopting soaine beneficial arrangement. Since that time the negotiations had been going on, and from the numerous parties who had to be consulted delay had occurred, which, hoorever nnuch to be regretted, was not surprising. LOSS OF THE TRANSIT. Mr. HENLEY asked whether the Government were in posesson of further infornaition respecting the low of the lransit than the statement which had appeared in the newspapers ? Lord PALMEBSTON.-No. We bave no other in. formiation than that contained in the telegraphic despatch which has been published, and in which there is some sort ofVconfusion. THE 51ST REGIMENT OF LIGHT INEANTRY. In reply to Major KNox, Sir T. RAMSDEI said that an answer to a memorial from the officers of the 51st Regiment respecting their field allowances had been sent by mistake to the commanding officer of the 38th Regiment, bat tho mistake should be remedied as soon as possible. COMMUNICATION WITH LNDIA. Mr. GRIFFITH asked the noble lord at the head of the Government whether it bad been under the consideration of the Government to avail themselves of the opportunity offered by the Atlantic Telegraph cable not being now in employment in order to get it laid down in the direction of communicatio 'with India-for instance, to AlexAn. dcris? Also, whether it was true that permission had been obtained from the Pasha of Egypt for our troops to pass by the Isthmus of Suez, and whether it was the intention of Her Majeaty's Governmeut to send them in that way? Lord PALMERSTON replied that the cable was not the property of the Government, and could not beoome so without the sanction of Parliament. He would not give any opinion as to whether it could be of service in the way pro. posed or not, but at this period of the session no applcation could be made to Parliament on the subject. With regard to the second question, he had to reply that no particulari communication had as yet passed between the Psha of Egypt and the Governrment. The House was, however, awarm that during the late war it was thought desirable that we should avail ourserlts of the means of oommpunica tion by the Isthmus of Suez, and that on application being made to the Path of Egypt he not only made no objection, but gave every facility for the conveyance of troops. HIs. hon. friend must at the same time be aware that the pasage by Suez to India was one attended with great inconvenience, dificuly, and expense. (Hear, hear.) KENSINGTON BARRACKS. In reply to Mr. KERR, Sir J. RAMSDJN said it was the intention of the Go. vernment to remove the cavalry barracks at the Kensingtongate of Hyde Park, and that arrangements were being made for another site. PORTS AND HARBOURS (IRELAND). On the motion of lMr. Mi.CACTNmY, returns were ordered relative to the Port and HArbour Comniissioners for Ireland; also with referenco to municipal corporations in Ireland. NATIONAL EDUCATION (IRELAND.) On the motion of Captain D. O'COI~Ns.L, there was ordered a eopy of correspondence between the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland and the Rev. J. W. M'Gauley relative to his resignation of the situation of Professor in the Training Department of the National Board. LORDS' AMENDMENTS. The Lords' amendments to the Probate and Letters of Administration ([reland) Bill and the Joint-Stock Companies Act Amendment Bill were agreed to. RUSSIA AND CIRCASSIA. Lord RAYNHAM asked whether the Government had received information that the Russians, notwithstanding a clause in the Treaty of Paris to the contrary, had sent a hostile expedition across the Black Sea against the Cir- Lord PALMERSTON said his noble friend was aware that by the treaty of Paris the Black Sea was declared neutral, with the exception that Russia and Turkey were allowed a certain number of vessels for the police service of the coast, and that the other-Powers were aUlowed to have two vessels each to see that the regulations relative to the Danube were observed The coast of Circassia-that was to say, the eastern coast of the Black Sea-was ceded to Russia by Turkey atthetreaty of Adrianople-that treatycedingcer tamEointyname along the coast round to the Sea of Azoff. Tbe= susstanswere engaged in hostilities with the Circas. sian tribes on the northern part of the eastern coast, and it appeared that some of the cruisers which, by the treaty of Paris, Russia was entitled to maintain in the Black Sea had been sent to operate against theCircassians at Genetchik and Redout Kalei. He did not apprehend that in so doing the Russians had at all exceeded their powers under the tieaty of Paris. (Hear, hear.) The House adjourned at a-quarter to 4 o'clock, until 2 o'clock to morrow.

THE AfILIZIA. TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. t Sir,-By the offliejl returns laid on the table of the Honi of Commons duing the late wars with RuBs, it wars clarly showrn that no less than 38,000 men Tolunteeqed from the em'oodied Mlitia to the Line, most of W10onxwa sent out to join iegimentS stationed in the Crima.' It Colsequently follows that nealy all the recruita, so to .ay which kept our Line regiments in a fit Satewto me1 1t64 enemy came from the Militba. Now, when we come' , consider the very large force lately ent out to Indis lager one than txt sent to the Crimex,-mnd wheni& take into aocount the hxvoc thWt will be made among tharm by an Indian climate st this, timne f the year, when tVe troops will be generally in tents, we must oerainly iialulate on i loss of st leat 20 pef cent., lexving out nU the casualties that may take place by the sword. And how 's this to be made good if only 10,000 Militia are to be eni. bodied, whereas in the Crime,M War we hxd some 60,000? No doubt, Lord Palmerston stAt.A distinctly, inreply to the able speech of Sir De Lacy Evans, that 30,000Militi. wotd be immediately embodied, but Lord Panmure hu Inocked down this number to 10,000, a number that nearly everr sane person in the kiDgdom thinks absuraly low. We mint have soldiers; and how are we to get them? That is thb question. And I sar, as one wel acquainted withAke matter, being a colonel of a Mil'ta regiment, that ulel the same rule is now followedas was done in the late wai the recruiting for the Line willfall off tom alrminngdegreo I am willing, as all colonels are willing, to give my hea mes for the service of my country. I did soin the laewar having had 600 well-trained men voltmteer-from my regi mentk anid I bope to do the same apin; bat H -weare a ot embodied it will be impossible to do so; and I believsall wiU agree that wfhen colonels and offloers of Militia willingly encourage their best men to volunteer, and thus to bnetly depopulate their regimen* and having again and again to driU raw recruits, and to do this without a grumble, the bave some reason to be proud of fheir nselfishnees16 n.&l their ardent wish to serve their country, so far as-lie3 within their nower.

Sir, -Will you permit me a few remarks on A letter-in some respecta exoelient-on "Recruiting,from Militia Regiments," which appeared in 27c 2Times of the W9Ih inst., adgnedby a " Commanding Officer of Militi,.," frorao.wlq has seen somewhat of the working of the preaent system The writer of that letter seems to think that it wlli be * great loss to the country wrhen toso whom he termp "country gentlemen" ceame to belong to the 0ilita, forgetting thAt there ar plenty of half-pay or reord offiee of sufficient "influence" in ach county to raise mnenas speedily s at present, and far better qualified to disocipIi them when raised. But, besides the miuor questions of whirh lass of offiee would have most " influence In obtaining men or over them afterwards," or which take most " interest in dramwing thieir pay," it would be well that the country should zemember that in organizing Militia they are organizng a forcs which may some day be required to prOoot onr own shoresa, and that it would be well to havoe ,in us XMlitia, a force cap%ble of acting lbefore wa- ememy. Now, we can hardly expect the "country gentlemmnAallowing him all the pluck of au Englishman,. it whoem principal "interest" in his regiment at present is, to got through a fieldday without committing hituelf-Io be8, to handle a regiment before an enemy as one bred to the service, and we may in our hour oif eed find that, whUeile have an army in India without men, we have aas army in England without officers . Would it not be wiseto easabhlx the rale, that none should be appointed to the ranok of field offlcers in the MXiliti ba$ those who have served a certain nxmber of years in jtbn army; or, if it be thought desirable for the sAke of thg Vrestipe which it may give to a regiment to have a county gentleman of great inf'aenoe as its fulU colonel, in whom the appointment of all officers except the field offlicers and. sta shalbevested,yetthat it should be anhonoraryappointinent, ad that he should no mote think of commanding the?rgi. ment in the field than a, fuU oolonuel of the Line.

WZSDON, TUEBSDAY, AUGUST 25, 1857. In the fouma. of Iou Last eveiiiog, fLord RMSDALM eantered into % jttififttion of 'the course taken by him on Flidaif last il lirpbpWing -hat the consideratioU of. thi amendmenzta.of,the Commons to the Divo.rcBill should be postponed for six months, and denied that 'be had intended 4bAdngthbGOvernJenib`YiUrPnie. LordG LB sooepted'thi sAura .,lrjt it- wasnot uXtilieQ .observatious by Lordz. M si, the Daileof h.AW , the = CHA O;Los, and Lord. 0Las. sf that their Lordahips proceeded to considerthe amendmenta of the Commbin&to the Divorcewlind XatrimonWA NulisPBilF7 . - . ,Lord RED,Asps oppoed. tking theri into, 'consideration. He objected to the introduc 'ion of local jurisdiction, and conside6ed btht the four ner causes for which, by. the 'Commoas' amedmenits, a -wife might sue for a divorce, were escentially erroneous, and that the cemedn devised as a substitute for an action -of crir. con. was, in fact, nothing but a re-vival in a new form of that action itself. A fne on the adulterer rnight' be imposed without any such action. Re also-disapproved the clause which zequirel clergymen who conscientiously objected to marry the divorced parties to Ku1renider ,their churches for the jerformance of the ceremony. 'he parties T ithtl g6 before thee registrar and then proceed to auv priuh izt the 'iidom where the clergyman was willing to perform the ceremony. It was'-evident, he 6bs&rved, that the peole were only just becoming sensible of the pro ble ebeevk of ie Big; and to precipitate the esatue was not doing justice either to the country ur to Parliament. The LORD CRANCELLOR said the aruments of Lord R DmSAia did not refer to the question whether the amendments sbould be taken into consideration then or that day six months, but whether hthq-eamenndmenta were or were not iyapsements of the Bill. The merits and demerits of thoee parts of tbe Bill to which Lord REDEsDATE had adverted nere discussed by their Lordaships before the Bill 'was sent down to the Commons. He admited it would be more expedient, in the first instance, to confine the jurisdiction to a central court; but with that point their Lordabips were competent to deal. TIhere was much difference of opiniol as to the abolition of the action of crim. con. Great pecuniary loss might be caused by adultery, adnc e thougLyt it not altogether safe to abolish that action without giving a substitute. This the House of Comuons had done. After briefly adverting to the qther aneud. ments introduced by the Commops, the LonRD CIIA?NCELLOR urged that those amendments were aU such as their Lordships were -competent to deal with at once, and that the argument of Lord Bx}rEsDEAT for delay proceeded upon an entire fallacy. LorJ ST. LKOwARD's said he should support the amendment, because the only alternative open to their Lordships was either to accept or reject the Commons' ameadndents without consideration. Nobody might be to blame for the prot rated dicusions in the House of Commons, but thst did not zlter the fact that the time at their Lordships' disposal did not admit of that attention to the ameudnewan whioh their importance required. After dwelling upon the great difficulty which had been experienced. during the discussion of this mteasure to aetermine upon an adequate tribunl before which cases of divorce ohould be brought, he declared his confident belief that the part of the 3Bil whioh cosatitted the court of quarter sessious such a tribunal would break down. He suggested, therefore, that the clause relating to local jnradidtiou. sihvd no& be pressed. ie strongly objected to the clause making adultery upoa the part of the husband when it took place in the conjugal residence a ground entitling the wife to obtain divorce, and believed it wvould be found produotive of great mischief. He regarded the clausewhichallowedthe husband to petition for a divorce and to claim damages against the adulterer as a most monstrous one. WVith regard to the clause relating tothe clergy, he could not approve the priiple of placing the clergy above the law. He regretted the introduction of such a claus%e bu', respecting the conscienees of the persons as a concession to whonu this pioyiaou bad been introduced, he was not prepared to vote sgainst the amendment. Lord GrxAEwusE did not complain of the courm which had been taken by the noble Lords who had gone so fully into the consideration of the amendments of the Commons, but suggested that the intimate knowledge they had shown of those amendments disposed of the charge that the Government were askina the House to adopt provisions the value of which it va imposzible for their Lordsbips to understand. Should the amendment of Lord REODSDALE be carieed, there would be an end of the Bill for this session, but, if not caxried, tim proper time for considering the amendments was yet to arrive. After a few words from Lord CABARvoN their Lordahips divided:- For the motion ... ... 46 Against it ... ... ... 44 3iajority ... ... -2 Their Lordships then proceeded to consider the Commons' amendments. The LORD CHAaCXIZr,o moved that the clause establishing a local jurisdiction iu cases of judioial separation be agreed to. Lord MONTRAGLE opposed the clause. The judges of assize would have no time to perform the additional duties vhich this clause would impose upon them, and the coart of quarter sessions would be utterly incompetent to deal with the questions that would be brought before them. He therefore moved the omision of the wotdla from the cdszoe giving power to the court of quarter sessions.. Lord HARDWICEE supported the amendment, and was of opinion that the gentlemen of Englaud would not than)k Parliament for asking them to attend to duties they were so ill qualified to perform. Lord WviForo, Lord PoNns, lord FORncUE, and the Duke of Soranisir having expressed similar opinions as to the impolicy of conferring on the quarter sessions a juiadiettion on these, matters, L3ord GxAWN`viL1E consented to the omissioni of the words, and the clause, with that omiarion, was then agreed to. The words "Or of adultery committe'd in the conjugal residence" were disagreed with by a majority of 17,-the contents being 27 X non-con.- tents, 44. On the motion of the Bishop of OxFoBD, the words " guilty of adultery " were reinserted for the purpose of providing that when the husband had been guilty of adultery the Court should dismiss his petition,-the contents being 39; non-contents, 35. lThe cleTgy clause and the other amendlments of the Commons were, after a division, agreed to, and their Lordahips adjourned at 10 minutes after I o'clock. k In the House of Commons, in reply to Mr. HBNr.sy, Lord PAr.imsrow stated thwt thae (isernmaent were not in poisession of any further information as to the loss of the Transit beyond that contained in the telegraphic despatch, which was aomewht con-' fused. In answer to an inquiry by Air. GRiam, Lord PATsmxsrox said no. particular conavauncation had passed between HEm M.aasTY's Government and the PA.smA of EGOYPT respecting the conveyauce of British troops through that country, but during the Crimean war such an applcation had been made to the PASSIA, and no objection had been offered by his Highness or by the Turkish Government, but every facility was given to the passage of British troops. In reply to Lord R.YHmsar, Lord PEwzaEsro s zaid he apprelhended that I Russia had not exceeded her powera under the treaty of Paris in the Black Sea. * The aouse ad.lourned a-t a ~qlter it t o' clock.
The all-important controversy -which, at this crisIs of Englaad's fortunes, has been agitating and almost enlgrossing successively both Houses of Parliament for a quarter of a year, returned to its origitnal battlefield in the Lords last night. The question was the adoption of a certain number * of amendments which have been. amply discussed in the Commons, many of them previously in the Lords, and, we take the liberty to add, out of doors also. These amendments, thoug&ruiing bno a considerable number of clauses, from the verbal alterations entailed, are yet reducible into a few distinct and particular altefttions. Nobt onlt have they been settle4, in ..an eveniung, but, as appears by the sequel, there wanot -h Peer who had nqt already aiTivea at . decided u'tgment upon them. However, this is not the way in which rgligious aud cousacentiouspoblemen, professing a monopoly of high feelings and sound principles, unrderta1ke 'the cause of tru jih oxlity, religion, and Heaven. Thee things, it appears, are not strong enough to standoonAieir own ground, or to !k9e.way on their own metits. T:ruth-can only be advanced under false. pretencAs, the be.he of &1nsroTix~ps can only be . smggle& mt thin vlgar reahTun aid common eshs wriggledin ome. indirect way into an Eaglishinan's Mtle6twig. Aqcordingly the lig'hts of the Vritish- RobiliHY to whom we are to look -for- the preservation of our faith 2aud our -morals, set about . resisting the Divorce Bill with the artifices tore usulally observed in the witnen-bo;, wthen suspicious-looking personages are warding off too curious inquiries into their proceedings. 'They liad not time, they said, to consider the amendments of the Commons. They nilist nct be ]prried in so serious -a matter. The sinperIty of this objection wax proved by the deliberate.oeyiiatton of two houtrs7 before the debate in aL ere wrangle as to the persons most to blame, for a previous wrangle on Friday last. Whew thi& -*as over, instead of then procee4ing. to a quiet examinatiQn of each amemImmtiwith X view to economize the. h,Ur. aaid to l1e aumbered, there ensued a veheolent resistance to the discuion of the amendments,,t. all th'is yea, on the ground that if they were abi;sc4 long enough collectively there would not be time left lor tahing them onne by one. The Lords, it was said, knew nothing about them, as was subsequently proved by a close 'scrutiny- of their merits and an evident deciaion upon thenr. ,Nowv, all this we expect in some places, QD some subjects, and from some persons. In the profane *politics of the world it is common enough for second-rate politicians, not the first-class, to make it their object to damage, to obatruct, and to disable. They kill time and drive business into a corner to 'get something out of the 'confusion. But this sacrifice of time said to be much needed, and this confusion so patheticaly de-plored, were in this case the work of noblemen; the Wights of their age; of men who deplorb the decay of manners, the blight of faith, the neglect of high prinoiples, and the dishomLour of religiolln .and who have an unfailing stock of solemn tones and pious grimaces at cdmmand for the abuse of this journal. Of course, every speecht hat-was made in favour of more time did in fact.consume -it, and, had their Lordships not made up their minds already, might have prevented them from doing so. When half the evening had been lost in this way, and LoTd mRB DAzr'S motion for throwing the J3ill into, the next year had been defeated, their Lordshipa proceeded, at last, with diminished time Mfd strength, to the severRl amendments of the Lower flouse. They now quickly showed themselves quite equal to the work, though it is possible they might have done better if they had begun a few hours earlier. The jurisdiction given by the Commons to the Quarter Sessions has been rejected without a division; so on this point they have not required a twelveinoth to make up their nds. It must be admitted that the Lords are good judges as to the capacity of Quarter Sessions for thiu purpoe. The plea for a divorce by a -wife against the husband on the ground of 44 adultery " committed in the conjugal 'resid6nee" has been rejected chiefly on account of the looseness of the phraseology. No doubt, many act might come equally under this legal description and yet ba of veer unequal guilt, according to the circumstances, the deliberation, and the habit. The otner pleag of the wife against the husband have been retained. The words destroying the case of the husband against the wife, on proof of adultery at any time committied by himse3f, struck out by the Commions, bave been reinserted by a small majority. We are disposed to think the Commons -ill stad out for this omission, as it certainly is not according to common sense and common feeling that a man should be tied all his daYs to an intolerably bad wife, in consequence of some single and long-past act of infidelity. It may be very proper in the Bishop of OXFORD to take this way of inculcating upon men that they are as much bound to the moral law as women, but other considerations come iu, and we question -whether there is a Bishop in Christendom, or has been for centuries, who would refue to Eit down in the company of a gentleman who had been once unfaithful to his Marriage 'vow; while there are few Bishops in these daWY, at least in this country, who would not object to this degree of familiarity with a woman BO guilty. It is a point, we conceive, in which the law must conform to the feeling, and otherwise will §o far become a dead letter. ) The amendment which seemed to restore the action for damages-one of the great blots of thd existing practice-was warmly debated, and on a division, in which proxies were used, was retained. The obstacle to the entire abandolnment of the" action for damages is the notorious fact that the wife's ortue has been sometimes the chief attraction in the eyes of the adulterer, and withou+, somne check or other might become so even moreihan now. - Moreover, the commonest sense of justice will hardly endure to see the guilty enriched by their crime at the expense of the injured, including, perhaps, helpless children. The species of action instituted by the Commons'| amendment,. and the half civil, half criminal character of the damages, may give rise to difflicul. ties requiring fresh' legislation; but that does not impair the priuciple of preveiting, if possible% ihe guilty from obtaining a mercenar profit oxi their guilt, and saving the innocent from ruin, in addition to misery and diihonour. The next discussion arosoe on the concession made in the Commons to the feelings of those clergymen who, for one reason or another, do not wi to be obliged to perform the miarriage for those who have been divorced. For our part, we think the concession a weakness. There are, however; 'very 'ew clergy who, after the. consideratioi? forced upon them during the progress of this |measure, are prepared to' maintain that marriage is indissoluble. They merely allege, as the Bishop of LoNDos; very trly sates, the disAgreeablenese of reading the service fei persons comparatively unworthy of it. This is' a"natural and honourable 'repugbance, but it is not one that the Legislature need take into account, as 'unworthine3s is only a question of degree. We are aware that some half-dozen zealots have shut their ears to reasoning and their eyes to the Bible, and maintain that no crime, no form bf law, can dissolve the mysterious marriage tie. But they have been generally repudiated, even by the 9,000 subscribers of the Dl)elbration. It' is, then, -only a matter 'of feel-; ing. Well, the clergy are to be allowed the indulgence. But the i Lords' in, alowing it bave not also given them the power of closing their churchea, in which -they have but a very subordinate authotity.' They -may' refuse to perform the service and absent themselves, but the' churches will still be open 'for the performance of tlhe service ana the obtaining of a blessing for, those who, having sinned, now repent, and wish to do the bese- that is posibie under their1 unhappy cir6umsaAcesz-th'at s', live togetlhie as Christian man and wife.

Sir RopxurT PEEL occupied a station similar to that which has sEince beet held'by -is old opponent, but orly after he had released hif6llowers from their alleriance, and renounced for himself all' futher pretensions to office. Age has not so far cooled Lord Jonxf Ph'USanis aspirations as to reconcile him to abstinence from politicAl struggles. Still an expectant Premier, willing on occasio-n to be once more a party leader, must, nevertheless, have sometimes felt reluctant to descend 'into the arena against such unknown opponento as he has had to confront. The champion of the House of Commons must be ready for aU challengers, and the veteran combhtnt has few opportunities of adding to the glory which he so often puts to hazard. ' The experience acqnired during the recent session 'might also suggest to LordJoHN RussELL au honourable retirement to the Lords. The new members, who' are the most assiduous fiequenters of the Rouse, were elected to support or to oppose Lord P&nSZTso?, and' they only share to a limited extent the deference of their predecessors for the timehonoured leader of the lVhigs. The respect which is inspired by visible power and success fell to the share of the PnuswEn, and, the prize of oratory was awarded without dispute, to the copious periods of Mr. .GADsroNn.F On more than one occasion, and especially after MX. DisrAXLI'S ill-timed Indian declamation, Lord JOHN RUSSELL made good use of the moderation and authority which in any HIouse of Cormmons le must neceessrily possess; but when he left openings for criticism he proved to have lost something of 'his accustomed immunity from attack. If he urged weighty reasons against the Ballot, raw- Liberals said that 4e was old-fashioned and retrograde; when he found fault with the Government he was accused of factious restlessness: activity and silent vigilance were equaUy liable to an unfriendly construction. When a veteran statesman loses a portion of the accumulated influence of years, he cannot hope to reconquer his position in a struggle 'with younger men. If the House of Coigmons is impatient of an old reputation, the Lords are greatly in want of an experienced leader whose energy is yet unbroken by timne. Lord DInuy, who unfortunately. represents the majority of the House, is a consummate rhetorician; but the absence of serious purposo makes him at the same timae rash in debate and timid when it is necessary to formn a practical decision. The Law Lords are extraordinarily clever and inexhaustibly vivacious; but among their unumbe'r Lord Ly.n Ess r alone influences the political dAliberations of the House, and a prodigy cannot b. expected to last for eyer. A statesman of unrivailed Parliamentary accomplishments and of commanding reputation may. once more he able to re-vivo the wholeaome'elasticity which has so long preserved.the 'Upper Branch of the Legislature from any dangerous colision. The leading advocate of the JTewish claims has done his work in the House of Commons; in a future session he might, perhaps, accomplish the more difficult task of inducing the Peers 'to discontinue an unsprofitable and mischievous resistance. It is still more desirable that the question of PIarliamentary Reform should be urged upon the attention of the House of Lords by the statesman who of all others is most generally trusted by the supporters of a change in the representation. The Opposition mayprobably for some tiim command a numerical' majority in the TIpper House, but it is much to 'be wished that the preponderance bf ability. and of influence should be on the Liberal side in b6th branches of the Legislatufe. ' Lord JoHN Rtshe , too, as a Peer, would be restored to the'position of a possible Minizter. It is - unnecessaty to discuss the impediments which would prevent his return to power as leadet of the House of Commons, but the jealousies arising from former events will be forgotten when'' personal collisions are no longer to be apprehended. - Prudent 'politicians have for some time regarded with anxiely the obvious dearth of rising statesmen. Till the deficiency is gatpplied the country- caii ill afford to dispenm' with the services of those leaders who bave so long infltienced the deliberations of Parliament. If the course of events should bring round a RussELL IMinistry, its chief would derive authority from experience, and in a ' new- sphere he would be in some degree exenpt from the temptations whieh have led him into .former errors. A Premier in the House of Lofds his less facility for committing himsrlf andhis colleques to some extemporaneous course of action provoked 'or suggested by an angry debat;e. - The promotion, if Lord Jomx RussELT should ever, accept it, would hardly be' quoted as an instance of the boasted prooess by which fresh blood is from time 'to time introduced .among the hereditary Peerage; but it is for the interest of the House of lorda that all conspicuous statesmen should -in turn. apire to itX honours. The beat- answer .to sneers againat born legislators and obstructive oligarchs is to pomnt 'i the leading members of the Houie to those whom the community delights to. honour. Lord Jomn RussBmn belongs by his birth 't;he highest aristocracy, and that connexion'fist' offered' him the opportunities of which 'he bas so ably availed himself. At firt, it might haves been. said of him, as of one of his family-, that he. was " rocked and " d4ndled, into a&-legislator-;'" but the influence of rank in' Englan&dm 'something like that of pur- chase in the army-, 'which 'is said to. bringg young' men forward t6 the public advantage, although it spayibo at the bosblofiiIjustice to others.

A great King once testily observed to the Com3 nmander of a Foreign Brigade in his tervice that the corps in question gave him more trouble than all the rest of his soldiers put together. " Sire,.'I was the reply, " your enemies make exactly the " Eame remark." lVe are afraid that one-half onily of this description is applicable to the case df the foreign troops enlisted in the service of the British Government during the last war, Our, attempts at recruiting across the Atlantic uivnLse us in grave diplomatic difficulties without yielding us a single company. Our levies on the continent S were embodied and disciplined only in time to see' the conclusion of the contest for the exigencies of ujaich they had been engaged, and were then either disbanded on easy terms, or carried to the Cape on conditions tantalizing to the British soldier and' disagreeable to some 'earnest politicians. Still worse was our fate in Turkey itself, for not only were our Bashi-Basouks pre-eminently unserviceable, but the inutility and costliness of the corps baye actually survived its dissolution ; and the concerns of this precious levy have added upwards of 4,0001. to theEstimates after the. troops themselves, as a military body, have ceased to exist. At first sight there is no denying that the project was a natural one. We were protecting the rights and dominions of Turkey against the aggres, sions of a formidable Power. We possessed enormous resources in money, munitions, and all the otlher ingredients which turn men into soldiers, and soldiers into an effective corps. What we lacke4 was the raw material itself-the men to be clad,. trained, equipped, and commanded, and this want Turkey seemed able to supply. An athletic ina' mattial population, already acclimatized, born for the saddle, revelling in the use of the sword and the exercise of all warlike accomplishments-sucwas the description given of these Asiatic camdidates for British pay. Moreover, the idea was unexceptionable in itself, for if any people were naturally bound to the defence of Tarkey the obligation -was surely ineumbent on the Turks themselves, or the tributary subjects of the PouTz. So the design was adopted and put into execution, when the difference between a regunient of cavalry, in our acceptation of the term, and a swarm of Bashi-Bazouks became speedily and convincingly manifest. The old plan of taking elephants into battle was nothing compared with this-we might as well have raised a battalion of tigers. Our recruits were, no doubt,. remarkably strong, and weU adapted to war as far as concerned its license and its carnage, but in thie attributes of discipline, subordination, steadiness, and the other requisites which go to the production of military efficacy they were sadly deficient. The idea was accordingly given up, and along with some hundreds of thousands of British money we thought the Bashi-Bazouks had vanished into space, when, behold, they emerge with cbaracteristic features of expense and -unprofitableness in the shape of charges for a Court of Inquiry, which terminated after all its cost in a conclusion of such oracular ambiguity that neither the one party nor tthehother could appropriate the honours of the day. .A Parliamentary return just issued informs us that the Court of Inquiry referred to involved the occupation or detention of 5 Major-Generals, 4 Colonels, 8 Lieutenant-Colonels, 3 Captains, and. 4 civflians, upon whose pay, allowvances, aud traveiling expenses was disbursed the Esuil of 2,5951. Gs. Td., in addition to which the services of HER MATEsny'e ship Gladiator vere put into such requisition that she expended upon the duty no fewer than 529 17-20 tons of coal, valued by competent authorities at 1,8281. The total, therefore, gives an amount to be added to the old BashiBazouk score of 4,4231. Gs. 7d.,-a sum of money which at this maoment would carry between 150 and 200 soldiers in first-class clipper ships from Portsmouth to Calcutta. What the grand total of this investment represents we forbear to inquire, but, if the expenditure is to be mn ! ny way remrunerative, it must be in the lesson which suih an experiment conveys. The question, indeed, of native levies is but too interesting *t the present hour. - A little reflection will bring any one to the cons' clusion that the BritishEmpire must necessarily to a great extent be supported or defended by trooph& of foreign blood. The extent and character of. our dominiou forbid the very supposition that the, popul4tion of. our owa islands can ever supply thesoldiers required for the establishments of our enormous territories. Even if soldiers were levied as they were , levied by Prussia in the Seven Years' War the thing could not. be done, besides which. there exists in every country a certain military spirit, which, for seeu-. xity's sake, requires absorption in the service of thegoverning State.. At this moment we have half the races of the earth in. the iranks of the Imperial j forces-Buropeans,. Asiatics, Africans, and Americans. We have Frenchmen in Canada, Italians at Malta, Germans at the Cape; we have Malays and Arabs at Ceylon; and between the Himalayas .and Cape Comorin we still, after the shameful defection of a whole army, retain the services of as many tribes as would fill a, whole column of ethnological tables. In Southern Africa -ve have Fingoes and Hottentots, and in INorthern America we contribute but a xmall proportion from these isles, to the aavailable forces of .the country.- TQ -diso pense with these aids to Government is plainly 'impossible; the problem is howr to eamploy them with the greatest, 4mount of security, and thlat-litr has not been yet splved -wre paiufuliy taughtbyf thre 4aatar ndy and murderous o4slauoght of near 100,OQO mien.

SECOND EDITION. THE TIMBS-OFF109, Tuwday Mwonmg. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corre. spondent, dated yesterday (Monday), 6 p.m.:- The Emperor arrived in Paris from Biaritz at a quarter to 9 this morning, sooner than was yesterday expected. General Fleury, the First Equerry, and M. Mocquard, Private Secretary, were waiting to receive His Majesty at the Orleans railway terminus. The waiting room was handsomely decorated, but there was no display of troops. The Emperor, who was in plain clothes, entered an open carriage with Generals Edgar Ney and Fleury, and drove off without an escort. A Council of Ministers asenm. bled at I o'clock, but the subjects ther diueed have not yet transpired. It has been conjec1ued, among other suppositions, thak the Emperor is getting impatient of the delay which the settlement of the Moldavin election question experiences at Constantinople. AccordiDg to the very latest accounts, Lord Stratford has not only not yet obeyed the orders received from his Govenment to communicate to the Porte its adhesion to the decision of the four Powers, but he has induced Baron Prokeeeh to imitate his disobedience. it may be questioned whether the recorda of diplomacy afford a parallel case. The Cabinets are agreed, but the Ambaasadors refuse their adhesion, and commnd the situation. t People here wonder if this is to be the lat of Lord Stratford's pranks, and whether the British Government will a last make up its mind to get rid of so inmubordinate an agent. They ask alo, if Lord Palmerston will dare recall him. The inpreson is pretty strong here that there are not many things Lord Palmerston dares ot do, but the removal from the Pera Embassy of the mn before whose awful preueno and impetuous word the Sultan himself is said to tremble is just one of those few bold acts fom -wrhich it is here thought possible that the English Premier may recoiL I mentioned yesterdaylthat the Sultan consents to new elections in Moldavia provided the demand be made unanimouslylby the six Powers. In coming to this decision he was partly influenced by a commaunication from the Turkish Commissioner in the Danubian Provinces, who declares that new dec. timos will give the sme result as those that have been annulled. The same opinion has been exprawed by Sir Henry Bulwer to his Government. The union fever is by no means so strong in Moldavia as in Wallachia; the larger province having most to gain by it, while the srualler one fears absorption and the loss of its capitaL Bucharest, a more important and central city than Jasy, would doubtless be the capital of Roumanu, although the Idea was staed last year of selecting another town for that honour, which should be neither Jassy nor Bucharest. Several foreign journals have denied that Baron Prokewch was blamed *by his Governament for his recent conduct. It is certain that Count Buo1 communicated to M. de Bourqueney a despatch addressed by the Austrian Qovernment to M. Prokewch, in which the latter was to'1 that his Government "regretd ex4romely that he had exceeded his insirutions," words which, in diplomatic language, unquestionably constitute blame, although expressed in term of moderation. The Duke of Gramont, recently appolnte Ambasador to the Court of Rome, is expected in Paris to-morrow, coming from Turin. The King of Sardinia assured him, when he took his leave, that he greatly regretted his departure. On the other hand, the Pope's Nuncio at Paris told Count Walowdki that M. de Gramone's appointment to Rome w- very agreeable to the Holy Father. Lord Howden has left Paris for London. Senor de Laftraga, whose approaching departure from France has been announced by several foreign papers, has not yet arrived here, but is daily expected at the Mexican Legation. A despatch has been received at the Paris Legation of the Republic of New Granada, announcing that troops have been landed at Panama from some American ships of war. TLhe disembarcation was effected without opposition. The Rusian corvette Amazon, commanded by Captain Kuhn, and at present ia Spithead roads, is expected shortly at Brest, where she will remain sOme time before returming to the Baltic. The Princess Vogorides, who has been for two months in Paris, left this morndng for Vienna. It is attributed to her influence and intercession that no demand has been addressed by the French Government to that of Tarkey for the removal of her husband; rauch though the Emperor was displeased at his conduct before and during the Moldavian elections. To-day's Debats, in a long and intereating arLicle, aeeks to prove that the origin of the mutiny in India is to be sought neither in foreign intrigues nor in the incapacity or neglect of the officers of that army. The writer believes that Russin agency and manceuvres can be traced in Central Asia only, and do not extend to our Indian possessions; he thinks it would be imposible for European agents to dwrell and wwo! in Inlia without discovery; and, a for native agents, he believes they would long ago have sold the secret of their proceedings to the English authorities. He remarks, with some truth, that it must be most difficult to conceal the presence of European agents in Inda, where, with the exception of Government servants and their families, Europeans are extremely few. With respect to the officers of the Indian army, he expresses himself as follows:- " It is unjust to attribute theresponsibility of the present evils to the officers of the Indian army; the responsibility mus be placed at a far higber door. Them officers, who are now Buffering the terrible consequences of a situation they had not created, cartainly merit somae sympthy.

I subjoin that part of the article of the Dgbats relating to the supposed Russian intrigues in India:_ "The opinion is widely spread in India that the long train of powder whioh has burst under the feet of the British at Teheran, Delhi, and Canton proceeds from a concerted plan prepared by Russia during the late war, and not abandoned by her after the conclusion of peace. In India, a sincere belief reigis with respect to the power of intrigue and the diplo. matto sdill of Russia, notwithstanding thab the events of the lst few years ought to have proved to the most prejudiced that this skil has been vastly exaggerated, and that the power of intrigue chiefly exists in the credulity of thepublio. Did we not, in fact, witness during the late war the utter impotency of Russia to produce an explosion in countries undermined by her influence, such as Bulgaria, Servia, or Montenegro? But if we in Europe are awae of the reality, people in India are not so far advanced. That Russia pomessm agents in Central Asia is a matter of certainty, and doubtless their mision is to raise enemies to England. Some of these agents, and notably the unhappy Vicowitch, who disappesred so suddenly, with his papers, at St. Peteraburg, have created too much noise in the world to permit any doubt with regard to their existence; but it is not so certain that these ageats penetrate into British India. The presence there of a European is difficult to conceal, and it would be almost im. pomdble for a stranger to circulate among populations speak. ing an infinity of languages and dialects without being detected and denounced by the police. It may be retorted that, if Russian polcy does not possems direct agents in Indis, it employs a ho3t of emissaries, recraited among the traders, travelling fakirs, caravan drivers, &c., of Asia. Now the slightest knowledge of the East teaches that nothing serious could be obtained from such instruments, evea if they were employed; for A!atics placed between two Christian Powers world betray both. Now England pays better and more willingly than Russia; consequently any intrigues of the latter would speedily be disclosed to the British authorities. In reality, the theatre of the struggle between the two countries is st1il confined to Central Asia, ani we should be very much surprised to learn that the intrigues of Rusia in India extend beyond the more or less authentio commanications she may reoive with regard to the finances, the army, the condition of the country, &c., from Greek or Armenian mechants established at Calcutta or Bombay. . . . It is therefore neither in foreign intrigues nor in the faults of the officers of the Bengal army that musA be sought the causes of the Sepoy revolt." There are various reports as to the length of time the Emperor will remain in Paris or at St. Cloud before going to the camp at Chalons, which is to be hin next move. Some say he will remain here a week, others that he leaves to-morrow morning. The latter is certainly not true, for Lord Cowley is going out shooting with him to-morrow. To-night Elis Majesty goes to the Grand Opera, where the French version of the Trotnae* is given. The report that Prince Albert and the Duke of Cambridge are to visit him at the Camp of Chalons has not yet been confirmed. The display of troops will not be very large, although their quality is first-rate. The Imperial Guard numbers 24,000 men, of wi ch 20,000 will assemble at Chalons. A narrative of Prince Napoleon's voyage in the North Seas is expected Phortly to appear, written by a Polish gentleman. M. Billault, Minister of the Interior, han addreased a circular to the Prefects, directing that a general census shall be taken throughout the whole o. France of the number of domestic animals, cattle, &c. It is expected that this census will be taken in the first fortnight in December of each quinquennial period. The Messager de Bayomne says- "BiArritz has never been so animated and briiant as this year. It contains at this time nealy 6,000 bathers. Bnuilding have been rmn up as if by magic, and the acomn. modation has been so much increased that, in spite of this influx of stranger, lodgings still remain vacant." Trade is beginning to improve in Paris. Some manufawturers in the faubourg Saint-Antoine, who have acquired a reputation for the superior finish of their articles, find great difficulty in procuring a sufficient number of hands to execute their orders. Other honses are busy in renewing their stock of goods and in preparing for the winter trade. Some commniion agents have arrived in Paris from the provinces, and several foreign orders have been received. The commercial relations between France and Turkey are becoming more developed, and Algeria promises to be a good customer to the mother country. Several clothing establshments in Paris have received large orders from Switzerland and the Brazils, and trade with England, which had fallen off at the first news of the Indian insurrection, haa again revived, and large quantities of " articles de Paris" and perfumery were exported last week from France for England. Letters from the manufacturing districts announce a general iuprovement and renewed activity in commercial affairs. The amount of busine3s transacted at Roubaix is said to be astonshing. This manufacturing town has, within a few years, acquired considerable importance, and the les made there are daily Increasing. The high price of Lyons silk has been favourable to the production of woollen stuffs mixed with dilk, of which immense quantities have been exported to the United States. There has not been an operative unem. ployedat Poubaix during the last 18 months. ComI mercial affairs are beginning to revive at Rouen, but busineas is stil quiet at Mulhouse. The exorbitant price of the raw material is the principal difficulty the cotton mauufacturers have to contelad with. The manufacturers of Lyons and St. Etienne are beginning to receive orders from the Paris shopkeepers. While trade is improving in Paris, the shopkeepers in the adjacent villages are reaping their annual harvest from the fairs which are held in one or other of them every week at this season of the year. The fair of Batignolles was held yesterday. The weather was delightful, and the village was crowded with strangers. It was very tastefully illuminated at night, and the proprietors of theatres and booths must have recelved a large sum of money. It would be impossible to find a more orderly crowd. There was not, the appeaance of a drunken man, and, strange to say, in a country where everything is controlled by a, military force, I did not perceive even a policeman There has been very little businem tran ted in the French orn markets duning the last week. At the lat Paris market holders of wheat were lem anxious to sell and endeavoured to obtain an advance of If. the hectolitre, but pur. chaer would not submit to those terms, and there was searcely any budsness transacted. Priine wheat irm at 38f. the weight of 120 Ilogrammes. Tie last heavy rain has set some mills going, and it is expected that flour will become more plentiful in the market.

The late rains have done immonse service to the vineyards, aind hastened the maturity of the grapes.

Yesterday the Emperor Napoleon!s fete day was celebrated here. As it was expected, the lUnionist party,which has here its stronghold, took this opportunity to ohow its feelings of gratitude for his pro. tection of its cause. Already at the Te Deum which was held at the Roman Catholic Church the great number of people assembled gave to the cere. mony the character of a popular demonstration. During the day the advanced portion of this party, headedby the editor of the Concordia, went in a body to the French Commissioners, while the more moderate men of the Unionist or, as they call thenmelves, National Party, mustered not less strongly at his levee. In the evening a well attended and very orderly serenade by torchlight concluded the proceedings. Besides the wish of showing their French sympathies, this demonstration was likewise intended by the Unionists to contrast with the stillness which they intend to observe the day after to-morrow, on the birthday of the Emperor of Austria. This was scarcely nece6sary to convince every one that the Immense majority of this country is for the Union. Indeed, the popular feeling in this respect is so strong, that those who ae either wavering or from one cause or another are opposed to the union do not dare to express their opinion openly, for fear of losing all chance of electon. The tide of popular opinion in this respect is so xtrong that nobody dares to oppose it. AU1 those who do not share extreme views reserve their activity for the Divans; in the meantime, they swim with the stream, and try to keep afloat. Asthe most wealthy andrespectable part of the population posess moderate views, there is little doubt that the majority in the Divan will be theirs. They take great pains to ensure their election, an' canvassing tours in the districts have become the order of the day. It is, above al, the extreme views of the advance I party about property which have frightened al proprietors. They fall scarcely short of a badly digested Socialism. In elections where property forms the qualification of the voters such a banner was scarcely calculated to insure success; it is thereo fore confidently expected that in the class of the great as well as of the small proprietors men of the advanced party have but little chance of being elected. In the towns this is rather different. The greater part of the voters-nijerchants, artisans, house proprietors, and lawyer&-are not affected by any of the theories by which the extreme party pretends to regulate the position between landlorl [and peasant; having no landed property and pea- santo, they have nothing to lose or to gain-at least they think so, wlfle opposition to the upper class is rather popular with them. Still, with all this, it may be expected that even in the towns moderate men will not be excluded. Only a few days ago there was a struggle for supremacy between the moderate and the extreme party in Bucharest itself, in which the former maintained a depided upper hand. The Unionists have establishe4 a1 over the country electoral com. mittees, under the direction of a central comraittee in the capitaL This committee, chosen months ago, long before there was an extreme party, is exclusively composed of moderate men. The return of several of those who had been exiled gave a new im n pulse to political agitation. Theyfound the place occupied, and they saw that their only chance lay in putting forward extreme views. It was therefore mooted. that the committee was no mora up to its duty-that it did not represent the views of the majority of the voters; and it was proposed to elect a new committee. The voters seem not to have been of the same opinion, for all the old members were kept in their plwes, and the extreme party, in spite of its endeavours, could not bring in a aingle man This triumph of the moderate prly is a good sign for the elections, and has done a good deal to revive oonfidence, whica had been almost lost. Extreme vieWs aboat property seem to be most to the taste of the peasants, and it is by no means neessary for the development of this taste that the advanced political party should take the trouble of agitating. On the contrary, all agitation of men in black coats would be only received with suspicion. In the movement of 1848 the Provnsional Government declared the pea3snt proprietors, and these latter had to pay dearly for the momentay hope-foreign occupation after foreign occupation-during which all the labour and money came not from those who had declared them proprietors, but from the peasants themselves. This has not been forgotten, and the consequence is that the peasants will no more trust the promises of the young party. They have taken the thing into their own hands, and in every district peasant leaders appear, who we working on their ownhook. In this respeet there is a great difference between Moldavia aud Wallachia. In the former country there is no trace of a movement among thepeasants. The Wallachien attribute this to a want of feeling of independenoe in the Moldavian peasant, caused by the greater pressure of the landlords. From what I have seen I should be rather inclined .to attribute it to a diametrically opposite cause-namely, to the better understand. ing between the landlord and tha peaat. Most landlords in Moldavia. occupy themselves with thelr.estates,.ad live thre the grteater part of their time, while moat of the Wlachianstates tefarmed to4reeks and. Armeniane,,aud have, porhp,for. generationis not bemi visited: by their proprietors. With . system of abnteei,1 all inmluence of the landlord haa beenlost ever the peasant in Wal-. lachia, while iu ol1davla the interest of both preo pared t4e way for a futurre Wrranment. . Mot of the peaants in Moldavia would be content with-a frew system of farming; that is, that their relation to tbe proprietors of the woitahould have the charac i ter of a.free agroement between the two parties. In Wallochi;, I aim afrid, this would recely satisy the peaat,for . hasa taken, it Into his, head tat he has a right to the aoil which ho is cultivatingi ana-nothing leaa than property will suit him. All the moderate party wilt, no doubt, smite to oppose this light of spoliation; but .the difference in the position.of the landlord from the pe^wsat in Moldavia and Walachis. may.rprove av greater obstacle to the union than perhapa; any other cause. In the meantinie the politicai situation is still uncertain. No ne6s has as yet arrived of the eonsent of the Porte to the agreement betheeni Franoo and Engla4O athough it can scacely be doubted that the piciple at any rate ha been a- pepted. Buxt, where the paities have goie so far as in thoepresent cae, the slightest difreieice in tli det;~ wa eS! fi;thole n>ietibW1 Qi~Monhl reauring eircumstance is the understanding batween France and England; as long as this lasts no erious apprehension need be entertained. AUSTRIA. (PX oUa oWN OoRaLeroDXnXT.) VIENNA, AuG. 21. No oflic,l intelligence has yet boen received that the diplomatic relations between t he Porte and France, Russia, Prussia, and Sardinia have been renewed; but it is certain that the Powers mentioned are again on a friendly footing, as the Turkish Government, on the 14th inst., expressed to the French Cabinet its willingne5s to is3ue orders for a repetition of the Moldavian elections. As you leart by my letter of yesterday, the Emperor Napoleon positively did make concessions while at Osborne, and there is reason to believe that one of them was, that the union of 'Moldavia and Wallachia should in future be considered a Turkish rather than a European question. In a word, there will be no interruption of the diplomatic relations between France and the Porte, even if the Sultan should peraist in his refusal to consent to the union of the Danubian Principalities. It is related that the Turkish Ministry is to be reorganized, as some of the rmore prominent members of the Cabinet are disinclned to remain in office. The Ost. Deu&Ahe Post of this morning contains a short leader, in which it expresmes itb belief that the new elections in Moldavia will prove to the world that the country really is opposed to the union, but it is no longer so confident on the subject as it was a few days ago, for it concludes by the following sentence:-" However, if there should chance to be a majority in favour of the annexation of Moldavia to Wallachia, there can be no doubt as to the decision of the Porte on the subject, a decision against which there can be no appeal." The only intelligence brought by the Constantinople mail of the 15th inst. is, that the account of Schamyl's victory is " believed to be correct." The Circasian chiefs are about to meet in order to consider on the most effectual means of defending their territory against tle Rus. sians. Full a year and a-half ago it was said in my correspondence that Baron Brack greatly overrated the pecuniary resources of Austria, and the present state of the money-market proves that my opinion was correct. The place is literally inundated with industrial stock, and there would probably be a terrible crisis if the National and Credit Banks should cease to give such great asaistance to the financial world. While the railroad imana was at its height, it was the object of the different applicants for concesions to obtain the longest posible lines, and Government, instead of endeavouring to check wild speculation, indirectly encouraged it by giving even more than was demanded. Thus, the branchline from Linz to Passai was grantedto the Vienna-Linz-Salzburg company for the same reason that the line from Eperies to Przemysl was given to the Theiss Railroad Company. It was notorious that neither of the lines mentioned would pay, but the State required them for military purposes, and the Imperial Government was of opinion that those who get good ought also to have a certain share of bad lines of country. The East Galician Company applied for the line from Cracow to Lemberg and Brody, and received a concession, but on condition that it undertook to continue the railroad from Lemberg to Czernovitz and Suezana, two places to which hardly any one goes and from which hardlyany one comes. That the Austrian Government in now aware of having overshot the mark is evident from the following facts:- 1. The Western Railroad Company will not be obliged to construct the Linz-Pamsau branch line until there is a more favourable conjuncture, and, consequently, the capital of the company is to undergo a reduction of 15,000,000fl. 2. The Theiss Company wil not be called on to begin the line from Eperies to Przemysl until the money-market is in a more healthy state. 3. The East Galician Company has not yet began operations, and is not likely to do so for many a long day. 4. The Carinthian Railroad is to be but one-third of the length originally proposed. 5. It is propoed. that the length of the Oriental Railroad (Austro-French Company) shall be one-third shorter than was stipulated in the conrcesion, so that the capital Of the Company may be 100,000,000r. instead of 10,000,003f. By the strenuous efforts of the Credit Bank the shares of the first two mentioned companies are kept at par, but the last two are at a very considerable discount. The shares of the East GaUician Railroad are not in the market, the principal subscribers having agreed not to attempt to dispose of them during one Year from the date of the concession. Yesterday there was a meeting of the directors of the National Bank, and they were informed by Baron von Pipitz, the Governor-who Is a Government official-that the bill portfolio muat undergo a monthly reduction of 2,000,000A. as a preparatory measure to the resumption of cash payments. It has recently been runoured that the Freach Cabinet has again urged the Papal Government to make the promised reforms, and there is some trtth ia the report, but the friendly remonstranoes of France and England are not likely to be of much avail, as this Government is extremely lukewarm in the matter. Austria is jealous of the infuence of France at Rome, and she is greatly inclined to question the right of any Protestant Power to subject the head of the Roman Catholic Church to any moral pressure. As a matter of course, this Govern ment is blind to the fact that its troops would be unneoemary in the Papal Legations if those reforms 'were made which are so loudly demanded by the unfortunate subjects of His Holiness. It is very generally reported that a reconciliation is about to take place between the Western Powers and Naples, but you may be sure that such is not the case. It is a positive fact that the Count of Syracuse had no mission to the French Court, and Prince Petrulla, who went to Paris for his amusemont, had but one interview with Count Walewaki. It is whisperea here that the King of Naples telegraphed to his brother to leave Paris for Naples without delay, because he suspected him of having disloseod some of. the secrets of his prison houses. to thestoppage and ;obbery pf the diligen.e between IVerona and Inspruck on the 14th.

SPAIN. We have received the Spanish journals of the 20th. M. Pidal, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had left for Bayonne, it was supposed, to pay his respects tol the Emperor Napoleon. The Espana says- " It is positively stated that the Government hk dedded the questleo of the validity of the titles of the consolidated debt given in guarantee of anticipated payments by the Treasury, sad illegally alienated abroad at the period of the Progressista Government. It appears that after having heard the Royal Council, and in acoord with it, the State has decaled itel bound to reeognize this debt, subject to its having recourse to proceedings against those persons who made an improper use of these guarantees, which could not he transferred. It will be readily understood that In ating in this manner the Government has felt desirous to put an end to the prejudice whioh these titles caused to Spaish credit abroad."

IBRLAND. (rOra oB OWN0 OOBABNONDZIMT.) DIUBLIN, MoNDAy Moxsimm. THE POPE IN IRLAD. As might be auticipated, the revelations respecting Irish ecclesiastical intrigues at the Court of Rome made known through the Paris correspoindent of The FiOnes have created a perfect ferm}ent on this side of the Channel, and the Roman Cathoho journals are making the moat awkward attempts, if not to give them a flat denial, at leaht to explain for their own satiefaction some of the statements embodied in the communication. The lfveni?qg Post for instance, says that the letter is a strange compound of fact and fiction; while another organ, more hardened, insistis that the whole is a fabrication. The North" Whig, one of the ablest Liberal jourrnals in the kingdom, and at all times a warm champion of the Roman Catholic party, takes the common-sense view of the situatiion, and observes:- "The statement made is that the 'Barnabo-Cnlenp Government, whiob has one foot in Rome and another in 1)ublir, has decided to 'remodel' or reform the Catholib ehurch in Ireland, mainly with a view to destroy the national system of education, and to further de politialize Roman CAtholic ecOleslastics. What is there improbable in an in. tentlon of this kind ? We acquit Roman Catholic journalists of the least knowledge of Roman Catholio policy; the horth sauba them very unmistakeably, and that Is not a 'nisfort-e to therm. They have no fact- and no knowledge 0 rucle tbema in the blunt denials they are now venturiug on, and why should these charges against the Cabinet of their church be incredible ? Is it a new scheme, suddmnly burting upon the world, that Rome likes to have the management of her own people ? Is it hkely that in this age of telegrapbs and railways an swift international intercommunications the Roman Government is to be the only Government to refrain from intensifying the system of centralizing power and authority? Is it or is it not the case that there is a great split Mong the prelatea of the Roman Catholic ohurch in Ielad respecting the governmont of their chutrch; tbat Dr. C en and Dr. M'Hale are not as loving as neighbours, not to mention as bishops should be; and that the mission of the lato Mr. Lucas to Rome had certain objects about which hierarchical opinions were divided? And, if there be this disorganization in a body which unity would so well becomne, is it unnatural that the RoLan mind should con. ceive the idea, in ntter indifference to Queen Victorias supremacy, of coercing irish priests into disoiplined organization for purposes which whether Liberal or Tory in the narrow Britannic sense, should above all be Romau ? The allegations which have so violently alarmed one party, and which are so virulently denied by the otber psrty, are truthful.- looking if not true. It is evident that there isa gradual 'ap reach,'9 in militant phraseology, upon the independence of theRoinanCatholic church in Ireland. Dr. Denvir's visit to Romae was in oompliance with an order arising in a deter. mination of the Propaganda to insist on this distant west paying Canonical respect to the Holy See. A very little time w1l prove or disprove the correctness of this representation of the position. All we can say is, there is in the sketch, if not the 'zero,' the 'ben ti-roratoJ md that, as seems to us, al the recent hints and rumours In irs ecclesiastical should have prepared the Roman Catholic lity for this catastrophe of Roman dictation in British politica Cullenism is the denationaliz, iDg of the Roman Catholic Church here; and that is assuredly, the degradation of Roman Catholic laymen here. They are Inberals or they Lre not Liberals; and every Inberal is the enemy of a centralized Papal government of the Roman Catholics of Ireland. The national system of education established among us is good or ba,and the Roman Catholics who think it good ;wai desiretosee their prelates supporting It and aSsisting to direct it. We decline to join in any No-a Pry cry, or even in any cry about foreign intervention. we cannot see Vhat the loyalty of Dr. Denvir, or of any other right rev. psein need be in question because of a secession from the national board. There are precedents for loyal prelates escaping functions which they disliked, or were unequal to; and we rely upon the good sense and soind nationality of our Roman Catholic fellow.count-ymen. The Roman connexion is a nuisance and a bore to them. Ultramontanism has no charms for them any more than Rxeter-hallism, or any other worn-out old-world formula of exploded Toryism. But they cannot escape some of the political inconveniences of the Papacy, when the Papacy, without power, misuswes its traditions to anney the faithful who are weary of it. If the Propaganda is intrusive a sagcious Dr. Denvir vists it, talks it over, and makes as little fuss about the journey as poEsible. We must make allowance for these things. The ai of these Roman old women are preposteroum They wll do no great harm, and sensible men, Protestant and Roman Catholic, may in these islands laugh at themthough, naturally, the Roman Catholic glee is not the hearatiest.," TUB LA]BORll-MWrRY The Carlow AentisiM has soine senible remarks upon the present state of the labour market, and upon the neCessity of the farmers making provision for a greater scarcity of hands than that which now prevails, the effects of which are sorely felt in thome districts where the tide of emigration has all but drained off the labonr-ing population :- '"Wages averaged last weekc 4s. per diem, and 2s. for hinders, but the labour-market fell this week to 2s 9d., many of the farmers having recourse to the scythe in cutting oats and bearded wheat, owing to the high rate of wages demanded, or to the difficulty of procuring a sufficient number of hands It is undeniable that the tide of emigration continues to flow on steadily, and that the farmers must pro. vide some remedy to counteract the evil resulting from a -scarcity of farm labourers. As it is not improbable that this scarcity may be felt hereafter, it becomes the duty of extensive landowners to be prepared for this contingency, as the giits whivh Providence so bounteously bestows on the land cannot be neglected. What machinery did for the manufacturers it can do for the farmers, unless by steady, remunerative wages proportionate to the p rices of agricultural produce they can prevail on the ablebodied peasant to remain at home; but we can scarely expect this so long as the irish now mcerged in the American or Canadian population are realzlig funds to provide for the emigration of those they left behind in the old country. If labour become scarco at fature barvests, what is to prevent the farmer from avaiing himself of the agency of the reaping machine? The time in at hand when the farmer must provide a remedy to meet anS sudden deiclency that may take place In the labour-market arising from emigration or 'a strike' for higher wages, and, however adverse many of them may be to the adoption of the machines for atherinin the harvest, there is wisdom in being prepared ror emergences, with a knowledge of the fact that our ablebodied population are decreasing annually-wages rising in proportion to the decrease-and, moreover, it is equally true that this decrease is every succeeding year becoming mnore painfully visible." TIE R CRCAyrCRE O 8sPOL. The charge to be preferred to-day against the notorious James Spolleu is for the robbery of the :Midland Great Western Railwray Companyof the sum of 3501. on the 13th of November last, the night of the butchery of the ill-fated cashier. The hero of the Broadstone tragedy was greatly disconcerted at finding himself again in durance. He was taken at once in a car to Green-street station-house, where he was duly charged by Inspector Ryan. The charge having been read to him, he was locked up in one of the cells of the station-house, in which he will be detained until he is brought up this day before the magistrate at Capel-street office. It is said that some new evidence has been discovered, but the details the authorities are unwilling to disclose at this stage of the proceedings. Half-past 11 o'clock has been fixed for hearing the charge. It appears that Spollen was in possession of 101. on kbeig released from custody. This money consisted of the eight sovereigns which were rolled up in wadding in his drawer at his cottage at the Broaddtone terminus, and 21., the balance of wages due to him by the railway company, which he was paid after his acquittal. Spollen, when told. the purpose for which he was taken into custody rephed, after consideration, " It cannot be helped; but I know nothing of it." The son remarked, C11 ruppose this will be another three months' job :" to which Spollen answered, " We must only bear it With patience." It is believed that the authorities are in possession of new evidence calculated to bring home the minor charge of robbery against the prioner. (BY 5RrrMsE A rD Ico r ArTrc TL:GPRAP'.) DUBLIN, Aua. 24. P:XAM^NATION OF SPOLLxi AT CAPEL-STRERT POarE. COURvT TMS DAY. James Spollen was brought before Mr. Porter, the sittingmagiStrate, on a charge of stealing money, the property of the Mdland Great Western Railway Company, over the value of o1, on the 13th of November, 1856. The prisoner presented the rame calm and collected appearance, though not to the extent of unconcoern and indifference which marked bi3 demeanowr on former eccasions. A marked change was, bowever, visible in his personal aspect, and the whole visage has been so changed thM recognition from the portrait which were exhibited on the trial would be rather difficult. Mr. Corbalis briefly stated the case, and called some of Ihe witnesses who were examined at the late trial, bat no new evidence was produced. Mr. Porter having decided on committing the prisoner sking him the usual question, if he had anything to eay- Spollen.-I decline for the present to say anything till I havo an opportunity of oonsulting counsel. Ur. Porter.-I understad Inspector Ryan found 101. on the person of the prisoner, and he ahould have that sum to eMble him to procure professional assistance.

MONEY.AfRKBRTand ITYINTELLIGEYlNu1. Monday Evening. The funds opened this morning at an advance of an eighth, and remained with great steadiness tbroughout the day, although there was an increased demand for money both in the Stock-Exchange and the discount-market. The only quotations of Consols were 90f to i for money, and 90 g to i for the account. Very few transactions took place, and the improved tone was owing solely to a more falsourableinterpretation of the lndian news. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 215i; Reduced, 90i to S1; New Three per Cents., 9 1 to i; IndiaStock, 210 to 213; India Bonds, 22s. to 17s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, 4s. discount to par. The transactions in foreign stocks have been limited, and the market continues dull, although no actual decline has occurred. In Turkish there was a small improvement. Brazilian Five per Oents. were negotiated at 101* ; Peruvian Three per Cents.. 54; Portuguese, for the account, 45 and 451; ditto; 166, 46i; Russian Four-and-a-Balf per Cents., 99; Spanish Deferred, for the account, 25j; ditto, Passive, 5X; Turkish Six per Cents., 94i; for the account, 94j and §; Austrian, 80j; and Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 64k. The corn-market this morning was very heavy owing to the fineness of the weather and the largeness of the foreign arrivals, and a decline took place of 4a. or 5s. from the rates of Monday last. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 67f. lOc. for both money and account, showing a f- t.onal improvement. The letters from Paris state that the Bank of France will shortly commence issuing notes of bof., or 21. each, in accordance with the arrangements entered into at the time of the recent extension of their charter. The lowest amount hitherto having been 41., this step is likely to economize the specie circulation and to cause a considerable quantity to flow into the coffers of the Bank. It can, however, have no effect in checking the existing drain, but will accelerate it, unless for every note issnued the Bank retain a corresponding, sum in silver or gold. Supposing them to issue 1,000,0001. in 21. notes against 500,0001. in specie and 500,0001. in securities, the effect would be to add 500,0001. to the circulation, and to create a proportionate rise in the prices of all commodities. This would cause goods to be sent to France in increased quantities, and thus augment the balances against her, until she had sent away an additional amount of specie, sufficient to reduce her circulation to its former level. The case therefore stands as follows :-If the Bank merely issue the notes to draw in a corresponding amount of specie they may strengthen their position, but will of course make no profit from the operation. If, on the other hand, they seek tomake a profit by increasing their amount of securities, they must be prepared, in proportion as they do so, to find themselves drifting back to the condition which has so long occasioned them uneasiness. The specie from New York by the Europa, eid Boston, is 100,0001 nThe Baltic on Thursday wil probably bring a further amount, and the Persia, which may be looked for on Saturday, is sure to have a large totaL The advices on this occasion report nothing new. The weekly bank return had been rather less favourable, and some descriptions of istocks ad consequently declined. New York Central wasquoted 83; Erie, 32* ; Reading, 71; Panama, 97A; and Illinois Central, 119i. The harvest in Canada was not likely to equal that in the United States, but would still on the whole be satisfactory, since, although the wheat had been partially damaged by storms, the abundance 'of the other crops would render it a year of plenty. The 406,0001. of golddust and 105,000 sovereigns brought by the Great Britain wil reach London to-morrow. The sovereigns will be taken to the Bank, and perhaps also a great portion of the remainder. The Brazil steamer Petropolis, from Southampton to-morrow, is expected to take out about 50,000 sovereigns. The bar silver brought by the last West India steamer has been disposed of at 61id., showimg a dedine of id. from the price realized in the early part of the month, the market since that period aaving be n exceedingly flat. The letters from Liverpool to-day mention several additional failures, some of them for rather considerable amounts. The reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week are upon the whole satisfactory. At Manchester there has been some activity, and prices are strong, owing to the firmnesa of the cottonmarket and a diminution of production. There is stiU a slight speculative demand for India, and there have been some purchases on Russian account under the new tariff. Mr. Thomas Stewart, a manufacturer at Stockport, has failed for 20,000l., and proposes a compromise of 50 per cent. The Birmingham iron trade has been steady, and in connexion with several large contracts a slight advance has occasionally been offered. From Nottingbam no alteration is reported either as regards hosiery or lace. In the woollen districts there has been a fair average business, and some extensive shipments to America. The Irish linen-markets have been firm. Great satisfaction was caused to-day among all persons interested in the validity of preference shares by the announcement that Vice-(lhancellor Wood has given judgment in favour of the Great Northern preference shareholders in itheir suit against the directors to restrain them from paying any dividend to the ordinary shareholders without first paying in full the preference dividends accraed since June, 1856. The directors, however, it is said, intend to prolong the litigation by an apDeaL The Great Northern Railway report just issued fails to place the movements of the directors for putting the loss of the Redpath frauds on the preference shareholders in any new light. It calls, therefore, for no remark beyond a renewed protest against the system of throwing insults upon a minority, whiebjis too common among all Boards of direction, but which especially .distinguishes the Great Northern. In their mortification at the rebuke recently administered by the House of Commons they manifest their partisan character with more vehemence than ever, and also intimate that the decision of the House was not come to from any knowledge of the meiits of the question, or any desire for justice, but simply because the members had been subjected to the process of "an active private canvass," or what in America is termed " lobbying." Considering that the directors commenced the controversy by taunting a considerable portion of their constituents, and, at the same time, insinuatin-g that two of the law Lords in the House of Peers were acting under sordid impulses, this sweeping notiiication regarding one entire branch of the Legislature gives a perfect finish to their proceedings. With respect to their letters to Tlhe Times, which were such as to hub3miate every one interested in the decent conduct of the public companies of Eingland, nothing further need be said. The directors adopt the effusions of their chairman, and must therefore be placed on the same footing with him, especially as in the present report they repeat the quibble upon which he principally relied. Their grievance iJ that Tle Times stated that Lord Redeadale had recommended that, as a penalty for their gross neglect, the diectors should make up the loss from Redpath's forgeries froatheirownfuturedividends.WhatLordRedepdale recommaended was, that during the period while that Ices was in liquidation the dividends on the stock held by them as directors should be altogether suspended and applied towards repairing the deficiency. Lord Redeadale was dealng with them as directors, and in suggesting that everything they were entitled to receive in that capacity should for the time be forfeited he pronounced the heaviest censure that could be inflicted. It was the suggestion of the penalty itself that involved disgrace, the question as to its extent being rather of a legal than of a moral kind. To prevent all misconception, however, Phe Times, when called upon, quoted the whole of Lord Redesdale's remark, leaving the directors to gather from it any comfort they could. As to the suppression of their chairman's last letter, the assertion thatit was an answerto that which had been published from the solicitors to the preference shareholders is wholly incorrect. It was an answer to nothing, bat was an incoherent jumble, without even aninnal vigour, Mr. Denison's capacity for abuse having been tamed down probably through the remonstanees of personal friendx wvho may have felt for his previous position. Be had also been told that he had coarsely put himself out of the pale of further dission f the drectors really consider the - letter to have beeu an answer to thecharges brought gaint them tieyhad better print it for dis 4iuinaosigtbsi0 sharholder. Meawile, they may be wsin ueminded that these cba~g Are 4-4 TCha tS; t e~utd Redpatl to big von- fidential post, knowing that he had been a "Suo. cesul speculator." 2. That they continued him in that post through a notoriour career of extrava. gance, ad after it had been dis,covered that there was some confusion in the transfer accounts. S. That they declared they could not take upon themselves to support any Bill that could throw upon the preference slhareholders any portion of the loso 14. That they endeavoured±o prejudice thepreference 6hareholderc by declarin,g the statement that they were entitJed to s,o much dividend per annum to be false, although the question was avowedly one for an impartial judicial decirion. 5. That at a meeting of the sbareholders they rup pressed Lord Redesdale's opinionof theironduct. 6. That, through their chairman, they have treated a large portion of their constituents, and also Lord St. Leonard's and Lord Wenaleydale, with gros contempt; and, finally, that in the entire contro versy they have acted as partisans, and have adopted a tone calculated to deprive the company of that respect which it should be the business of every Board to cultivate and extend. Mr. S. R. Scott, of the Stock-Exchange, has appealed to the shareholders of the Great Northern IRailway Company to attend personally the meeting oon the 29th, instead of tramitting proxies to the directors "upon an ex parte statement altogether at variance with faebt." Mr. J. C. Heath, of Eing's Bench-walk, Temple, has likewise, on behalf of the preference shareholders, signified his readinees to receive proxies. A call of 151. per share has been made on the unfortunate shareholders of the London amd Eaern Corporation. At first it was stated the asets would nearly suffice to pay the outstanding debts, and that probably all that would be required of the shareholders after the total loss of their paid-up capital would be that they should give their promissory-notes for an additional 501. per share as a guarantee to enablo the corporation to obtain assistance from the Oriental Bank. The parties engaged in winding up the concern now state that the assets will yield considerably le6s than had been anticipated, and will take a long time for their realization; and that unless the call of 15L is promptly met, the whole affair may have to pass into bankrptcy. For the public good the latter consummation is greatly to be desired, in order that a ful exuosure may be effected of a series of acts which are believed to surpass any that have been revealed in the case of the Royal British Bank. The general business of the port of London has again been very active during the past week. The number of ships reported inward was 380, being 63 more than in the previous week. These included 9 with cargoes of sugar, and the very large number of 105 with cargoes of grain. The number of vessels cleaed outward ws 149, including 21 in ballast, showing a decrease of 2. The total on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 60, being 3 more than at the last account. Of those now loading o are for Adelaide, 3 for Geelong, 4 for Hobart Town, 6 for ILaunceston, 6 for New Zealand, 20 for Port PhillIp, 3 for Portland Bay, 14 for Sydney, and 1 for Swan River. The annexed is from the English and Australian Copper Company.- ,, The directors have received advioes from their mTnsger, dated the 16th of May. He states that eight furnace were at wrok, and addi, ' We can nowr pay the South Australian Mining A~ociation, and take onr share of Co p per every month.' The make of copper had been from the1st of July, 1856, to the 30th of Apri. 1857, 1,538 tone and, about 200 tons per month is about the presenlt m , nerly 2,000 tons will have been made during the year."

FATAx Aroml r-T D}zvIzZS, Aug. 22.- While two men-James Draper, a mason's laboue, and Robert Stevens, a brlcklajer-wre employed in repaiing the well of the Olive Brruch, a smaQ public house about a mile and a-half frou n)evizes, on the Bethroad, they became the victims of rashnees, in desoending the well without first ascertaining whether or nor it wr free from fonl air. It appears th8t Stevens had uot dewcended more than 20 feet when he became insensible owing to the carbonic aoid gas in the well, and lnstattly fell from the cradle by which his oDmpanion was lowfing him. With the hope of rescuing him Draper followed, when he, too, als I fe to the bottom, a distanoe of 45 feet. An hour had passed before the proper apparatus for expelling the deadly vapour from the well could he obtAined, so that a person could venture down with safety to bring tbem to the surface. Having been so long exposed to the influenoo of the noxious e8 life was extinct when bronght up. Draper had burled his wife about two months since and fo*iu. mately, has left no family; but poor Stevens has Pei a nick wife and a child to deplore his leg.

R1EPORT OF TR' Lnro Coxmsuoxn,&-A bluebook of 135 page juat issed from the warehose of the Parliamentary, pkWr contais the 11th report of te Commiioners iszianacy to the Iord ligh (lwdor of England. A la porton of the report is ocupied With local details of no interest to the general public, but a few interesting points are_preented to notioe whih may be briefly adverted to. The quetion of lunatic papers has much occupied the attention of the Commissioner8s and, although they are oompelled to speak with strong regret and dispproval of the continued and obstinate avoidance by a large number of cities and boroughs of tbe provisions of the Iegisature in relton to It, and of duties In some cum Imperfectly dishre by the county auhorities aho, it ia satsfactoryto discern, on the whole, a progres in the countffies during the ceut year more oonsiderable than for severl years pr2eedig New buldinsars wmoreactive - repartion, -s well as aditln b xsg institutions. Tbe commiioners at the sme tirne have alwas vstrongly objected to asylums exoeeding a oertin sze, a they fodeit the advantage, which nothing ca replae, of indiidal and reponible upervision, and the consequence iS an OCumIUatlon of chronic cuea m the larger asylms Thus the pro. pogition for the enluement of Colney-hatch and HanwoeU Luatic Asylums was objected to by the oommissioners but in vain; the committees, after a onference with the corminsdoners, remained firm, and the latter relnctantly gave way. They stMI insA however, on the neceity of morecarefully claafyingpatients6 separatingrecent and acte from chronic cases, and placing the latter in a lsaa expensively-built aylum. The grea increase of lunatic waj in workhouses is next adverted to, with the caumes of suc increase. Inanycae, It isobvious that the state of workhoues, a receptla for the inane, is becoming daily a subject of greater importance. uat Innato wards generall ae prononoed to be objectionable, a deteriorating the more hlwamis and Imbecil e sethat mig have yielded to earlyd cae hroni and permanent. The Irreguabr practice of sending lunatic paupers to workchouses in the first instance hateadof to regular asylums iedenounced by the commisoneza, as directly contravening the law applicable to insane papers. Anl appeal baa been made to the Poor law Board againsA lunatic wards. and in one case it Is the intention of the commissioners to appeal to t Secretary of State to irequi the local authoritie (of Norwich) to provide for their lunatic poor acording to there. quirements of the sute. The consequences of tbe negl of boroughs to provide for their Insane poor has been often shown, and great exertions have bee madetoobviate the evil. The prosetion of Mr. Snaps, the surgeon, for the manslaughter of the p-ger Iunatic Dolley, at the Surrey Asylum, and the det of the case, ocupy a large Qpac it the repo,rt but, as the subject is n4out d date,. we fozbor from dwelling upon it.

From the statement of Mir. Daniel it appeared that the nett revenue appl-cable to dividend for the half-year ending the 31st of )ccember, 1856, wras 24t1,923f. &i. 8d., hba; shortly before the end of that half-year it was discovered that during the preceding ei ght -years la. e qyuantities o~ each sort of stock,_ particularly of the orgina, had been forged by Leopold Redpath, -which , with the div idends, thai had been paid thereon, amiounted to nearly that eum, The valid stock not being easily distinguishable from the forged, no dividends could safely be paid, and as the holders ol thefrged stock appeared to have.purchased it 6oer- id e, and for value the corapany were advised to apply tq lParliainent for an Acet to make valid the spurious Btock, ard to authorize the payment of dividends thereon; In their report to the conmpany of the 4th of March the dlirectors recommended the adoption of this course, and added 'hat they could not take upon -themselves to proposo or support any Bill which should throw upon. the preference shareholders any portion of the loss. Tfhe directors3 also introduced into Parliament a Bill recognizing as validath~ spurious stock, and aukthorizing the purchase of an equa amounmt of stock ouat of capital which the existing Acts the company stll autbhorizedathemto raise. flpon this Bl being lad before Lord lIedesdale, the Chairman, of Commnittees Lrs the House of Lords, he objected to the creatioli of fresh capital, and insisted that the less should be paid outof revenue and within alimnited time. Atthe general meet, ing of the company held subsequently, on the 12th of March~ after considerable discussion it was resolved " that no divi-, dEad be declared, hut that this meeting considers it de. sirable that the balance of 243,92314 5s. 3d. mentlone4I ina the directors' report should he applied to raeet thq losses caused by Leopold R.edpatls, referred to in the directors' reportb, anid that the directors be ana are hereby request-ed and authorized so to apply the said balance wben and in such manner as they mar consider most hene-. fcial to theocompany." An amended Bill was thereupon in-. troduced into Parliament, which, after (like the first)y 3making valid the spurious stock, requied the directors to apply the above mentioned net balance ef revenue, and any moneys to ho received by the company fronDs Redpath'es tate in paying the expenses occasioned, by his frauds, in purchasing from time tetime stock to the amount of that, forged, and forthwith canctlling the same, and as to any suirplus that might iemnai~,.to a pply the samie, as far as it would extend, in paymetnts in eider to the different classes of she preference shaLreholders for the dividends to whic.hthey would havyebeen entitledi if the said net revenue had been apportioned as dividend at the general meetin of the 12th of March. By the 139th standinig ordtr. of the "House of Comnmons "no railway company shall hie authorized to alter the terms of an.y preference or prio rity of interest or dividend which shall have been. granted by such company in pursuance. of, Or which may have been confirmLed by any previous Act. of Parliament, or which may otherwise he lawfully subsist.~ mrg, unless the committee ontheBill report that such alteratior, ought to he allowed, with the reasons on which their opinion is founded, together with the number of prefer-: qEnce shareholders who have assente to or die.~ seLtCd from such alteration." The hill was introduced into Fariamient, without reference to this standing order, as a Bill which did not by its p .eiin afett d.,al 'with any right ofpreference shareholders There being some doubt, however, whether the Bill might not indirectly be held to have that effect, the preference shareholders appesred before the select committee of theHouse of Commons," and endeavoured, although withoutt success, to have a clause6 introduced expressly recognaizing their rights. Upon the Bill going to the House of. Lords, where no such staniding' ordter oxhiss, the director, apparently thinking that something to authorizza the cohfss~tionC Of the rights of the pre. fereace shareholders ought to appear on the face of theo BiU; proposed, after the latter had again failed to procure the isisertlen of an expresis clause in their favour, to aLdd to clause 3. whichL directs, ai~ already mnentioned, the application of any possiole surp,lur, the werds, '! and thereupon the said sum of 243,92Jh 5s. 8d. shall be considered to have beers ,duly divided ami.ng all classes of shareholders in. the cempaiy.' This addition was oppoced- on the thiyd reading, but carried on A divisioni by the niajority of`53 to 7. We sometirmes thank- God (s.aid the le'imnei gentleman) that wre have a House of Lords;- we -may alzo thank -God that we have a House of Conmmons, for on the Bill with this amendmnent 'coming dlown to them the com13mercial spirit of the House rose up in arms ao,a-inst such an introduction, and Mr. Denison seeing the fee..lg of the H3ouse so strongly against him withdrew it without going to a division. The Rotme returned the Bil to the Lords 'with the following reason for disagreeing to the amend3.ent :-` Because the said, amendment., if adopted. -woulId decide a question of law in dispute between the preference and ordinary shareholders of the Great Northern Railway Company which ought to be left to the decision of a court of law." Tire Lords thereupon did not insist upon thtir amendment, and the Bill passed as it now stands. The learned coumel then cited the oases of " Stevens v. -South Devon IRailway Company " (9 ifare), " Stu'rge V. Eastern Ur,ion Railway Company" (Lase Thizes for Decetmber .30, 1854, and July 14, 1855), and " Crawfurd v. ,N'rth-Easter RiMlway Comupany" (not yet reported). The first description, of Great Northern Railwuy' preference shares are 5 per cent, perpetual, and were issued under the provisions of the Great N7oztbem Rail way Acts Amendment Act of 1849, which enahied the company, with the as,sent of three-fifths of the votes at akny general maeeting, to guarantee dividends not exceeding 7' per cenit, per annum in p reference to the payment thereof on Ordinsar Barcs. ThLe next praference shares are 5 per cent, redeemable, at a premium of 5 per cent., issued unrder the authority of the Great Northern Railway Act *No. 1, 1861, which miade it lawful for the company to raise 750, 000. for completing the railway- by new shaxes, on which the -company, with the assent of thrqe-flfths of the votes at a general meeting, might guarantee the paymnent of dividends not exceedin- 7 prcent, per annum n. *preferenceo to the payment of aividends on the ordinary shares of the company. The next description Of preference shares was issued under the Great Northern R1ailway Coinpany's Increase of Capital Act, 1853, whereby the company 'was auathorized to raise 750,0001. by- creating new shares, which should bear and receive dividends at 4),pcr cent. Per annum in preference to. the 'payri:ent of dividends on the ordinary shares of the' company, redeemable at six menths' notice, on payment of ~Q pir- cent, preinumn. The last p reference shares were isssssc1 under the Great Northern Rtailway Act, 1855, whereby the company wero authorized to raise the further sum (if 1,000,0004. by shares. the holders of which should be entitlfed to the payment of fixed dividends at 5 per cent, per annutm in preference to the pDayment of dividends on the ordinary shares. Tho certificates of thLese shares all referred to the Acts of Parliament under which they were created, Much of the loss occasioned by IRedpath occurred before the creation Of some of these shares, The ATTroseRa.Gg2YrxERALr and the other counsel for the company and the directors ontendled that it was competent to the company at a general mectinog to decide'whether the preferenue dividends shouldt be paid or not; that it did not appe.ar that the company had by the majority of threefifths, as required by the Acts of Parliament, voted the twro first descriptions of preference share, nor did the terms of the resolutions of the meetings votingthem amut to a uratee ; anLd tha-t the Acts of Pa 'ament creating the two efercene stocks gave no guarantee; and that the Act of 1867 must he held to-have talen away aniy right the preference shareholders might have had to dividend for the half-year ending the Slast of December, 1856, and givSen in lieu thereof a right to any possible surplus of zho revenue fur tha-t hailf-year after purchasing the requisite amaount of stock, That iftey were entitled to be p id arrear out of the revenue of the last balf-year, and also to have that. balance, they might he paid twice. It was also contended that preference stock was a different thing froinguaranteedsatock, the latter gliving the right to arrxears of interest, while the formner did not ; Ind ltly, that the R,-dpath leases, being an uLnusual misfoltutne, should be borne by al shareholders alike. The defendants also rtlied uponi the affidavit of the chairman, in which he alleged that the shares in question were not issia.!d as, nor understood to be guaranteed so as to give the; holders a righLt to arrears. Sir. D,,c;1BL having replled, The VICE.CUAxCELLO5t proceeded to deliver judg. micnt. The only difficuilty in the cAse arose out 'of tho recent Actb of 1257. But for the third section of thai Act no doubt would have existed in his 116nour's mlind as to the right of these shiareholders to arrears The object of the Act was, to legalizej the spurious stock, to make proevLiskn for buying uip and extingui.shinig an equaal amaount, aind to authorize the payment of dividends. Ile agreed wit, the counsel 'who first advised the companies that this lor;a was like the falling in of a tunnel. Still there was no equrty that the preferenice shareholders should bear part of such loss, The principle wduld be the same if a clerk b aid ,tolen a box coittaininAg 0,0001. But for the 3d sectionn Iih lOes w nld come out of the geneal profits of the company. By the 120th section of the Companies' Clauses Act the directors must prepare a scheme showing the profits since the last dividend. No dividend was declared at the meeting iaA March. Neitber the preamble nor the flrt two tectioss of the Act of 1S;7 were incons,istent with this con-;' alruction. As to the Attotn4y.~en'eraria observation that t:re co-pany bad fal power to dispose of this question, they hade no power to vary or deal with the rights ~ad the preference ehareholders, That being Fo, had ?ar!iament -varied thqce righits Here the general (ieAotron as to arrgars was imtportant, because there se,medl no indication of any intention of theLeielature to t;ke awa,yaniysuch right. The surplus referred to in section 3 night possibly arise before any dividend should he ,dieclared, and hence a direction was egveil concerning such. balance. If there were n5o righLt -s general to arrears, the lubjrct became much more diffioult, Wease if Parliament. thought that the prefeence shme4ders had a ri'ht to so; mu ch per ceatn s oeut tir*ozsly as-a dividend might 4appen to be made, then it idsld h ilt so i'-rd a conitructiop that Parliamrent mtit to. ako awl,y from then a fund primarily lighie ib ' th^ ;j ¢ e, t m xhe a this ,otia2w nsured, an '1*t 7aSczirei1. nxt'flS - I pma lo E ±uxp Preferl Ihav A dand ~~~bl~t hd~lit~i eier Ad rstan8ind am ete e ' arrears. ([iB Honour her- refd'thg reidlu ;oh me I ing of the ith of JuDe, 1849) At the subse quent meeting Ot She nth of August, 1849, a report was read stating.tbat tIle shares had b eerissue,d bearing lntarest atv per ceat. wer annum in perpetultr,'-d that they were ratified by As of Parliament. lt is too lte for an comupany, after tailug subscrben ioneyi and as3uiDaeg ifiUtw refortingeto an Atithat tbretfiftthof the eotos at the meetiW dtdA no t a£eInl and t bat the ateclk was not issued under 51t e prorisions of the Act.

The last two Acts expressly say, that co much d;vidend shell be paid,-one of the Acts calls the dividend"'fxed," but this word doeas not make much difference. Icar giveuo meaning to theee shares except that the holders sball take out of the profits of the company so tuch before any profita are divided among the ordinary shareholders. Preference shareholders are sometimes strangers to the company, nd unless they were entitled to arrears the orlifary share- i holders mlght, instead of declaring dividends, resolve tD spend their revennes in rolling stock while the preference. sbares existed, and would thus, in effect, be receiving profits before the preference shareholders received dividends, This loss is like any other calamity, and does not interfere with. the rights of the shareholdors inter se. By giving any posible surplus to the preference shareholders the Act does not intend to give the ordinary shareholders profits before the preference shareholders are paid.. No 4ifficuly neqd arisein'this restect. If the preference shareholders are now siifiied, they carn hereafter maintain no action for suel surplus. I should not have arrived at the opposite conclusion even if I had made the opposite assumption, 'hat the preference dividend was only from half-year to half-year ; bccause the Act takes away the fund to which the preference shareholders are primarily entitled to look, and only. inferentlally could be held to give a subetitute. It woul4 not even then be clear that the Lgislatlne intended to take away positively therights of the preference shareholders, because there might, in the case of an impovenished company,' be no dividend for several years, and the Legislature might intend by'the 3d section that at all erents you; shall have the balance which rnay possibly remain of this) fund. The Court, therefore, declares that the plaintiffa -aEd oter holders of preference stock are entitled to be pabdd divldends out of the profits realized by the companies fromn the 30th of June, 1856. before any payment of dividends to' the holders of the ordinay origtnal stock, the A stock, or! the B stock, out of such profits; and that a perpetual in junction iesue to restrain the defendants from delaring or payrng any dividend upon the ordinary original, the A stock, and the B stock, without regard to the rights of the preference stockholders to be paid in priority their dividend fromthe 30th of June, 1850. The Court also deolares that the 3d section of the Act of 1857 is cumulative by way of security for, and not in substitution of, such preference dividends. The company must also pay the plaintifi?' costs.
ACCIDE2N ON TiE BRIGHTON RAILWAY. OFFICIAL ACCOUNT. Yesterday the train which left Brighton at 130 p.m. was unfortunately obAtrisoted on Its entrance to Redhill station by ogoods train shunting there, and notwithstanding that the proper signals were displayed, the momentum of the passenger-train could not be arrested in time to prevent a col. lision with the goods train. The collisioa, although of an alarming chAracter, waS providentiallyrnot attended with serious consequences. Several of the passengers received bruises by being thrown against one another, but not of a serious .nature. A rigid inquiry will be instituted by the railwayauthorities into the cause of the accident. ANOTHEP. ACCOUNT. A serious accident occurred yesterday afternoon near the Relpte station on this line of railway, by which several persons were more or less injured, and the traffic on the up I line impeded for a considerable period. The ccident arose from the Brighton 1-90 p.m.fast trian I running into some goods waggons which were in the act of being shunted just below the Reigate station to allow the passenger train to pass. The signals were deadagainst the driver of the up train, and bis conduct in driving agast them was considered by the officials so reprebenVible that he was taken into custody immediately after the collson. The 130 p.m. tralnfromBiighton brings on the 11 30 amct. fromPortsmouth, and yesterday thejointtrafllofrom thetwo places was unusually heavy. Notwithsta4nding this circumstance, the train was rather before its time on passing Horley, the next station south of Reigate, and the acciden t took place before the train was actually due Pt the spot where It cccurmd. The effect of tbe collision was to throw the engine of the passenger-train offtherails. The tender and guard's break did not leave the metals, but several of the first and second class casiages were throewn qff, and their inmates much shaken. - There were a great many passengers in the train, and autopg them several persons of distinction. Happily none of t ea appear to have been dangerously hnrti and all were ale to cwine up to London immediately after the accider,t,except the Honi. MT Hanbury Traoy, who remains 'at Reigate -under medical care. Tb Duobess of Inverness and the Bishop of Oxford were in one carriage. The Ducbess was much shaken. Tce Bishop fortunately escaped unhurt. Among the persons who suffere4 more or less by the collsion may be mentioaed the Rev. Ur. Clark, of Woodford, in Essex, who-sustained a severe hurt in his back; Mr. Ramsa , of Mill-hill an injury to the back of his head Mr. Bloomfield, of 30, Tavistock-Equare, an injury in the knees- Miss C'urtis, of 1, C:hester-square, an injury to the eye; kr.W. Holm, of Brighton, asevere injury on the nose; and a female domestic in the service of Miss Dyneley, of 78, U per Berkeley-street, who was much bruised. Jr. Greaves, stationmaster at Reigate, was on the spot when the occurrence took place, anod, after calrming the fears of the passenger9 as well as he was able, immediately Wee!grapbedto London for assistance, which was sent down froma xNew-cross without a moment's loss of time., Mr. Slight, the secretary, and Air. Hawkins, the manager of the domI pany, were absent in Paris yesterdiy, attending a meeting in connexiom, vith the company ; but in their absence the asslstant-secretary and Air. WaUis the company's superintendent at the London-bridge station, adopted energetic measures, and in a very shott time all- the passengers, withl ! the exception of Mrs. Jianbury TraaY, Wefe brought on to London by a special train belonging to tho South-Eastern RaUlway Company. Armong the passengers in the train was Mr. H. C. Brenchly, surgeon, of Brighton, This gentleman' rendered essential assistance to his fellow-passengers, and 1 came on to London with them. At the London-bridge station Mr. Wallis had procured the attendance of Mr. Cock, the eminent surgeon of Guy's Hospital, and this gentleman saw aU the passengers on their' arrival. The Pev. Mr. Clark accompanied Mr. Cock to the' hospital on foot, bat all the other passengers proceeded to their respective residences. The Bishop of Oxford was very active in renderng as-I sistance to his fellow-passengers. - His Lordship, on reachig Redhill station telegraphed to bis friends in London that "By God's blessing, he had escaped` injury." On his ! arrival in London, however, he rather forcibly demanded to I know from whom he was to obtain compensation for the! inconvenience he had suffered. The fizat guard of the train escaped unhurt, but the rear guard vyas. r,t so fortunate. The engine-driver, Taylor,l was mnch shakei. He has been a long time in the com2 pany's service, and was generally considered a s'eady and ceful man. As already stated, he is in custody, and wilt be brought up for examination this day before the bench oe magstrates at Reigate. Tlheordina ry traffic of the line was resumed at 5 o'olook last evening.
TO TEE EDIrOR OF TaE TIMES. lSir,-Another of tbose aeoidents which unfortanately seem to becom6 more anm more frequent occurred this day totths train which left Brighton at 1.30 p.m, bab whichj was fortunately not attended witb any lozs of life, A qaiarter of a mile before reachingthe Reigatejuuction wo waro thnrown offoour seats by a most severe shzck, and after recovering and making our way out of the carriages we saw that wa had run into a goods train, two or three carriages of which were smashed, having thrown our eagine right off the line. MAking my way throngh the rains I at oneo lo3ked for the engine-driver and stoker, whom I foand unhatrt, bat very much frightened by the accident, ne3r the tn3ader, " How. ever could this happen?" I asked tham, p ianting to the danger eqgual which was up close before us. " Well, Sir, there is no good danying it," they replied, " we, ran by the distant signal without looking at it, being at the time engaged in putting coke on; when we oame round the corve (the line forms a curve at this spot) we perceived the second signal and pulled up at ones, bat too' late to prevent the accident." I afterwards saw the guard, who had kis faso very much cut, and I asked him about it, when he said it was ali the fault of the engine-driver, for ho (the guard) saw the diitant signal standing at danger, and put his break on in con, sequence. " Wall. is there no communication between you and thedriverr' I asked. "Oh, yes; there is the wire,'. he replied, " but it does not always work !' A good many of my fellow.passengers bad their faces more or less cut and injured, among whom were three or four ladies, who seemed to suffer very much. The officials at the Reigato station rendered us aUl the assistance they possibly coald, and behaved throughout in a way which is well worthy of praise: We were conveyed in a separate train to L^ndon, and reached about 5 o'clock. Our train was due at 3 20 p.m. T -r ir~ - -Ea -4o; -1-1-1 - - A A TRAVELLER BY THE TRAI. LOunaoD, AUgust_ M.

The histrionic talent of Madame Gassier, however, is not so striking as her vocal proficiency, which show$ her ia the light of an origialj as well as a dexterous singer. This was:demonstrated last night in all the musio of Vjoletta, and especially fn'the first air, " Ai foes e lu," both parts of which wero exected with singular ability and effect, the slow movement being quite as expressivD as the quick movement was fluent, brilliant, and animated.

A now barytone-Sig. nor Drgne-produced a good impression in the partof tbe elder Germont, and, though somewhat awkswrd In deoprt. sment and not keenly apprehensive of dramatic proprieties, displayed certain good qualities as a singer, which, in apite of a voioe of unequal quality, justified favourable anticipa. tions of his future career. Signor Dragone, however, should remiember that the air, "IDi provenza it mare" is addressed to his son, and not to the footlights, wvhich are quite unconscious of the nature of his affliction, and therefore anable to afford him consolation. The opera is earefully got up, and the concerted mmsc went much better than might have been expected under the circumnstances. To-night Norma will be given, with Grisi as the heroine; and on Wednesday Aigoleuo, the cast of which vill combine the talenta of Madaue Gassier, Madame Alhoni, SiLnor MIario, and the new barytone, whose capabihities willibe put to a much severer test in the character of the outraged jester than in that of Signor Verdi's "p8re swobte," which in English may be conventionally translated as '"heavy father."
BOYArL SURREY GARDBRS. The grand " festival" whch is to terminate this second season of the Royal Surrey Gardens, and which has been for some time announced to take place under the sole direction of hL JuLlien, commenced last night with extra. ordinary success. Circumstances unnecessary to explain have left the management for the time being exclusively in the hands of h. Jullien, and on no occasion has he manifested greater zeal, discrlminati0n, and energy in catering for the public amusement. The entertainments were of varied and unprecedented attraction, both in the grounds from an early hour and in the Musicball vhen the concert took place; and, the splendid weather also taken into consideration, it was no wonder that ali immense crowd assembled. The Music-hall was thronged, while the gardens presented the mest lively spectacle. The enjoyment was universal, and everything passed off with the UtmoSt spirit. The audience was evidently animated with a strong feeling in favohr of M. Jullien, the result of certain events which have recently been made public and are likely to become more sb. On presentiag himeelf in the orchestra he was received with uproarious applause; "three cheers" were suggested, and responded to with acclamation, frotn one end of the building to the other. 1 J3ullien is an esteem;ed and inddfatigable servant of the public, and such a demonstration in his favour, under circumttances calculated to elicit sympathy, 'was the most natural thing in the world. The concert last night was distinguished by the apear. ance of those two justly celebrated siugea7 Grisi and Atboni, for the frst time together ince the year 1848, when they both sang iri the since much neglected, but Lot less magnificent Seniramide. Their combined performance on the present ocorsion.was in the famouis duet from that opera familiarly knoiwn as " Giorno d'orrore," in which the Semiramide and Arsace of former years were revealed with aU their ancient splendour. The duet was heard throughout with breathless attention, ana followed by thunders of applaume. in addition to this each lady sang an air-Grisi selecting Leonora's "Tacea la notte," from the Trovatore, AIboni the well-k±iown "lTyroiflcsne," fiom Doni' zetti's Betly-" In questo semplice." The audience were enchanted with both, ipplauding so vociferously that " encores' were inevitahle, and Guist repeated the last movemnent of Verdais song, while Alboni substituted the popular drinking song from Lucre-us Borgia (I Il segreto per ier felice"), introducing th t marvellously sustaned " trillo" (shake) which has alwgy been as much the despair of professional vocalists as the delight of amateurs, ''he rest of the concert was of the usaal descriptiou, unitinig the clatsical a*nd more ephemeral styles, to *hlch combination I Jullien has longaccustomed his patrons. Miss Poole, our excelent English singer, was encored in a pretty ballad; and the performances of the cborus, under Mr. Land's direction, elicted universal favour. The exhibitions outside, too numerous to particularize in detail, comprised, among other things, the perfoimances of a military band, an old English mortis danco, Rthiopian serenaders, the biothers Elliott, with their remarkable classical delineatiorns" on the " double trapeze ," a complete Spanish ballet, on a btage erected for the purpose; the ' poses gytnastique.s " of Herr Connor, who tbrew no less than 54 back somersaults in succession; 10 balloons of fair dimensions, " s hmsHbric and telegraphic;" various entertainments, mnsicst aind otherwise, on the lake; amd, last, not lexst,a " cufc chastant," or rather a concert a2frea,o, ia which M-iss Rose Brahama and other vocalists took part, much to the pleasure of those who preferred the open air in th 3 gardens to the heated atmosphere of the Music-hall. Th whole concluded witi a grand display of fireworks, with the extra attraction of Mlademoiselle Pauline Violanti, who made a "perilous ascent" and an eqaally "perilous desceIt" upon the tight rope across the lake. The out-of-door amuse ments commenced at 4 oldook p.m., and continued until the audience dispersed at the tormnation of the concert. Never was a large crowd provided with a greater variety of attractions. The festival is to continue for a fortnight, with Grisi and Alboni, Madame Gassier, and all the extensliv attractions we have endeavonred to describe.
Tn} COmtT-MAurTAL o.Vr OoCONEL- CLAuX.-The general cou:tmartial for the trial of Lieutesant.Co1onel J. Clarke, 1st West India Regiment, reassembled at Chatham gazrisois yesterday, at 12 o'clock, under the presidenoy of Colonel Hl Jervis, eommandant of theProvisional Battalioi, for the purpose of examining the witnesses for the defence On the oonrt being opened, the Deputy Jndge-Advooate, Maa? El. D. Ellis. proceeded to rera the defence mnade by the prisoner on Friday, the substance of which appeared in TVe Times of Saturday. The first witness examined yesterday was Lieutenant W. C. O'Shalaghnessy, 2d West India Regiment, who was in 'Bathurst, Gambia, on tho arrival §f the prisoner, and proved that no hostilities had takeu place immediately before Colonel Clarke's arrival, as was stated in the evidence for the prosecution; and that there were already two field-officers at the station when the prisonier arrived. The witness was present at an interview held between Colo4el L. S. O'Connor, C.B., and the great chifs, when the greatest anxiety for peace was manifested by them, Colonet O'Connor was Lieutenant-Colonel Hi's sup'erior officer; and on the reeeip4 o£ a latter from the Adjutant-General separating the command of Gambia aid Sierra Leone Colorcl O'Connor commanded the whole of the West Coast of Africa. The witness had delive;ed officul papers to the prisoner from Colonel O'Connor, aud the letter from the Adjatant-General authorizing th'esepnation of the tommand of Sierra Leone and Gambia was keot hy Colonel O'Connor at Govcrnment-hoase.Capta J. Macauley, 1st Weat Indlb Regimente, was next examined with the view of disprov.tzgthe fifth charge against the prisonerthat of advising and di :ecting Captaih learson and {aptaia Macaule not to obey the oommands of Lieutenant Colonel J. S. i Before being examined. CGptain Macauley'was warned by tho Deptty4Judge-Advodate that hq was-not obliged to aiswer any questions that mihbt criminate himself, as that officet is under arrest and will be triea by a general eoatt-haahrtial for disobeyiig the orders of Colbonel S. J. HilL The witness stated thit tle prisoner had'neyer advised him to disobey the commi nds of Colonel alill neither had Colonel Clarke ever forbidden him to obey Colonel Hill's orders. There 'was no oonspiracy between witness,- the -prisoner, and the-- lite Captain Pearson to mutiny Zad if there were any dispute betweea Colonel hll -and any of the officers of the 1st West India Regiment it was not the result of the prisoner s interference. Captafre Pearsion assumed the command of the oompanies or' the ooccaion &f the prisoner being placed under arrest, and witness never heard hix censure Captain Pearson for doing so, bat, on the contrary, continued on the samdefriendly terma with that officer a before. Witness bad not seen any orders pubiislted for th a prisoner to proceed to Gambia, but on the first opprtunity after his arival at Sierr^ Leone hd had embar0ed forthat station.

The Globe of last night says:-"The despatch of troops o 'India has lowered our home establishment of infantry of the line to 14 battalions, instead of 40, the proper proportion ! for the united kingdom. The arrival of four regiments from the Mediterranean in the course of a few days will augment the home strength to 18 battalions; but, on the other hand, it is more than probable that a further reduc. tion will take place in consequence of the despatch of more regimients to India. It is quite obvious that for some time it will be necessary to maintain a considerable European orce in that country, and whatever force is there must have a reserve of corresponding strength at home to supply cauaties. It has therefore been determined to make a considerable addition to the army immediately, which will consist, at the least, of 20 new battalions of infantry. Two of them will probably be formally created by appointment of the* additiondl odicers in th-morrow's Gazate, and the remainder will be organized with aU despatch. Even with this audgmentation there will be no necessity to apply to Parliament for a vetea.for, owing to' the extent of the Indian reinforcemenfs already despatched, we are now maintaining two cavalry and 24 infantry regiments less than those which are providcd for in the estimates. Some additional grant will, however, be asked for the Militia service before the rising of Parliament." Major F. B. Wara's A troop of Royal Horse Artillery arived at Woolwich yesterday at 2 p.m. from Ipswich, to prepate for immediate service in India. The command of the troop was given over at Chelmsford to Captain Whin. yatWs, second in command, in consequence of a fall from his horse sustained by Major Ward, occasioning severe in. uries, which prevented him from proceeding. The troop having halted on Sunday at Romford, arrived yesterday I morning at BlacTheath, where they were met by the rmounted band of* the brigade, who escorted them to the garrison. They were then joined by Lieutenant-Colonel 'aude, C.B. (who has recently succeeded to the command of the brigade), who preceded them to their quarters. It wvs rumoured in Dablin on Sunday that the Scots Greys, now forming part of that garrison, had received sudden orders to hold themselves in readiness for embarcation for India. The Royal Horse Artillery C troop, nnder the command of ILeutenant-Colonel Strange, C.B., will arrive at Liverpool en the 7th of September from Woolwich, and embark for Dublin, and on landing march to Newbridge Barracks, there to be attached to the Cavalry Brigade-viz, 3d and 13th ! ght Dragoons. - The Grenadier Guards, 2d Battalion, Royal Barracks, Dublin, under the command of Colonel Hamilton, will em bark at the North WaU on the 2d of September for Liver. pool, and proceed to Lendon. ! The Pembroke, 60 guns, screw steanmship (Coastguard ser vice, Leith), Captain John Fraser, arrived at the Great Nt oreat630 p.m. on Friday, and saluted the flag of the j Commander-in-Chief. She steamed into harbour on Satur- day, and reamains waiting Admiralty orders for her futare eestination. Her Majesty's screw steam frigate Cura,oa, Captain 'Forbes; late from the Mediterranean, arrived at Woolwich yesterday at 4 p.m. from Portsmouth. She brings 42 cases containing a number of ancient mosaics and other antiquities, excavated by the Rev. Nathan Davis, hear Tunis. and supposed by him to be a portion of the ruins of Carthage. The weight of the whole is aboat 10 or 12 tons. The Curaqo%, then comamanded by the Hon. George F.

THE BRITISH MUSEUM. TO TEHE EDI Oi OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In yonr journal of this day I notice the letter of a gentleman signed "Jestitia," stating that he had been many months endeavouring to obtain admission to the nation's library in Bloomsbury. I beg to inform you that all any one has to do is to offer a gratuity to the persons at the entrance. I visited that institation last Wednesday, and was there and then informed that the public were not admitted. However, with the interobange of a masonic kind of look, I was immediately passed, while I saw an equally respectable person refused. I then tendered 6d. in silver, which was accepted, as a matter of course. I moen tion this case because I consider it a grievous 4hame that every obstacle should be placed in the way of the public viewing their own property, aud that the golden key should still be the readiest mode of obtaining access to a national institution of that nature. I am. Sir- vnnr- J. C. B. i Al2g. !4.
I B URZSS MONVUMENT AT A ZR. I _ TO THE ED'ITOR OF THE 1IMES. Sir,-If the memory of Robert Burns has any interest for you, and a northern locality does not necessarily avert your countenance, you wiU -perhaps allow one who much Toves Bnrns and the country of Burms to occupy a few lines of your paper. Barns himself, poor fellow, so dearly remembered old Alloway Kirk, standing as it does within a few yards of his -nativecottage, that he contribated his Tdan o'Shantcr to Grose, in order to induce the obese antiquary to adopt aud illustrate the subject in his book. Were his shade permitted to revisitb the spot, it would see a new Alloway Kirk rising there, of suct magnitude and in such a relative situation as wouild excite a very different feeling. The banks of the Do)en are there of unsurpassed beauty, and enshrinea amid the finest of the scenery is the well-known monument of the poet, an exquisite Grecian temple, hitherto seenin alldirections around. It is scarce credible, but only too true, that the promoters of a. church for the district are building it so close to the monument as not only to disturb the piLgrim visitor with an. incongruous idea, but block up tho latter building from view in the twro directions from which for tho most part it is approaehed. Thus a pretty place, haUowed with softening memories, and annually a scene of pleasiug and elevating recreation to scores of thousands, is threatened with a blemish which mnst deprive it of three-fourths of its attractions and its sentimental effect. I visited the spot yesterday at the invitation of a number of citizons of Ayr, who aro alarmed in behalf of the mdnu)nent, and I felt appalled at the misjudgment whioh has projected a bulky building in such a situation. The walls are not yet twvo yards high; they might, at no greot'expehse, be removed to an unobjectionable site 200 yards dis-. :ta-it. Pormit me, through your nedium, to call upon the 'proinoters to have them removed accordingly, Every ,admirer of the Ayrshire bard vwilltbark them for deferri&g e o farto- public opinion; and they wiU greatly; honour; etminselves by the act. Should the2 unhappily pereist in their i ptesent course, I do not hesitase to predict that they wiU *subject themselvesto mcob-'ar ap mount of reproach as wfill scorch their very souls in their bodies, and make, them feiri to dwell anywhere withii 20 miles of the Bri o' Doon 1 let me bcoexcused for using strong expressions. ho templel ,raised.to Burns by "an admiring and repentant people," asi *tbe Earl of Eghntoun once happily expressed it, is not a guhject which a Scotsman can treat tamely, a nd the sympt-' !thy excited in my mind by the univershl feelingt of the goodt peopbo dwelling on the spot will erndure no stinted expres-; At the same time, I am eagerly ready to offer the haud I of congratulation, if, as I hope, wish, and pray they shall ; anfully gulp dow a ljitle dssappointment, and order off l'-this new 'Alloway Kirk to a place where ibs own good pver |pose will be served wFithout injury' to another and verg Isacred btuilding, with wshich it has properly no concern.

The report of the directors of this company seate that since the last general, meeting the works on the line have been steadilyprogressing, and betwreen Strood aud Fver- A ae drawing rapidly towardscompletion; ana although Eor3e delay has takeu place, owing to unexpected difficulties which have arisen at the Strood eand of the line, stifl the engipeer xpes no reason to doubt of the lIne being ready for *traMec in the autumn of this year. The report enters at sense length into the proceedings before Parliatent in I s£petot the Strood and St. Mary Cray Railway Bill proI botedby the company, and the Bill for anthorzipg tbe SouthBeaster Company to mnake a relief ltoe from Lewisham to Datord, both of which were rejected, the former by the House of Commonm, and the latter by the House of Lords. The directors consider that the principle has now been affirmed, that the EAst Kent Company ought to have an aceos to London from Strood indepeadent of the South.Eastern Company. The Bill for an extension of time for. the purchase of land for the Dover Extension till August, 1858, has received the Royaasseht.

Cubitt, the engineer, sttes in his report that the engines now traverse eig,bt miles of thp line out of the 20 miles between Strood and Faver. sham, and that at leat eight miles more are ready for balastiDg. The chief works how remaining are the viaducts and embankment at Rochester, and the balasting and laying the permanent way. Between Faversham and Canterbiry the works continue to progress at the heaviea; pomnt-viz., at Eusden cuttings and tonneL At Dover the tmmel under the cliff proceeds weUl; fully one-third of it is entirely completed, and considerable progress mnade vith the remander. The balance oheet shows that 457,6691. had been reeeived, inchtding 156 5461. during the half-year; and 440,4264 ex:pended, including 152,821l. in the past half. ,ear, lea - a. balance in cash and securities of 11.2431. eover extersSon account showed that 52,729 had been received, and 44,2091. expended, leaving a balance of 8,5201.

The report of the directors of this company for the halfyear ending June 30 states that the receipts amounted to 42,92., and for the corresponding period of 18.56 to 41,2191., showing an increase of 1,061 The debenture interest, rents, and other preferential charpesfor the half. year amount to 3S,660C. Deducting these from the inoome receivable from the joint traffic ccount there will remain 4,265. To this is added L2501., the balance from last *ccount, and 6464, rents and other receipts, making a total of 6,161. This sum will admit of dividends for the last haltyear, at the rate of 3Os. per cent. per annam upon every 100I of A stock, and at tbe rate of 20s. per cent, per annum upon the like amount of B stock, leaving A small balance to tho credit of next account. The directors are taking the necessary steps for the issue of the 51 per cent. guaranteed stock sanctioned on the 17th ult. The works upon the Woodbridge line are progressing satisfactorily, and so soon as the crops are gathered in the number of men now employed thereon wvll be greatly increased with A view to the opening of the line sinmultaneously with the opening of the Bast Suffolk line.

The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the offices, Great George-street, Westminster; Mr. I. T. Remington in the chair. Mr. Horne, the secretary, sesd the report, which stated that the construction of a line to join the South- Western Railway at Wimbledon, and ron into this comany's line At Epsom, had bern sanctioned by the Legislature. The construction of that line would secure to the Epsom and Leatherhead traffio access to the Son'th-Western stations at Nine Elms, Vauxhall, and Waterloo, in addition to the Brighton Railway stations at London bridge And New-cross. The cont:rat with Messrs. Brassey and Ogilvie provides for the completion of the railway and works by the 1st of Januamy next. The report adverts to various delays that had prevented the progress of the works, but the directors had now reason to believe that those delys were at an end, and that the works were pushed on with vigour; and that no exertion would be s red to insure the completion of the line by the 1st of Januaxy. The directors are satisfied that the capital will be sufficient to complete the undertaking, and, jndging by the promptness with which the calls already made have been paid up, they anticipate no difficulty in the supply of funds to insare its being finished by the day named in the contract. The capital account showed that 6,1961 had been received and 4,0791. expended, leaving a balance of 2,1171. The CsrAIRAN, in moving the adoption of the report, saiditwas satisfactory to find, after so much.delay, tbat the railway would be completed by the Ist of January next. Theyhad a most responsible contractor in Mr. Brassey, and they would take care to have the contract executed by the time tpiulated. In reply to questions it was stated that the line did not take the same conrse through Epsom-common. as that of the Direct Portsmouth, and therefore they had to purchase land for their line. They would require the garden of the toll. house-for the stationat Leatherhead, and the commissioners had resolved that the c3mpany should provide double the quantity of land in another place in lieu of the garden, 'They had some obstructions in obtaining pos3ession of land; one landowner demanded as much as 5,5101. for two and a- half acres ofland, but the companywere not disposed to give anything like that sum. The report was then adopted. The meeting was made special, and the directors were authorized to raise 10,0001. on debentures or bonds of the company. A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedings. WIMBLEDON AND DORKING. The first ordinary meeting of this company was held yesterday at the office, Greet George-street, Westminster; Mr. Hack-block in thLe chair. Mr Horne, the secretay, read the report, which stated that the Royal assent was given to the Act of Incorporation on the 27th of July last. In both Houses of Parliament the Bill was strenuously opposed by the Brighton and the South-Western Railway Companies. The Committee of the House of Lords decided against the locuts stand! of the former company, yet, under the cover of landowners' petitions, their opposition was unsbated. The South-Western Railway Comipany, after an unavailing opposition, entered into an agreement by which it was arranged that this company should make the railway with a double line of rails throughout, and with sufficient station and siding aocommodation, and finish it with all appliances for working, except rolling. stock aDd station furniture,; that the South-Westo Compiny should man and work the line and esintain tbe line for 45 per cent, of the gross receipts; that the South-Western Company should have the option to subscribe for 1,500 shares, and nominate two directors to sit at the board The directors considdr this arrangement favourable to the company. The SouthWestern Railway Company have subscribed for their portion of the capital, and every share in the company has been disposed of. The directors have received a tender from contractors of undoubted responsibility stipulating the completion of the line by the 1st of May nest, and the company are Already negotiating for the purchase of land, with a view to the immediate commencement of the works. It is estimnated that the disbursements will not exceed in the aggegate 4,2001. The CiAiitAN, in moving the adoption of the report, adverted to theoerrenuous o position they had met with in Parliament from the Brglghonmoany and if money could have defeated the Bill he thosig t it would have been effected, as it was reported that the opposing parties were prepared to spend 100,0004, if neeoesary, to throw out the Resolutions were passed adopting the report, elcctcng Messrs. G-. Cubitt, G=rssel, W. Jackson, R. Remington, M Uzielli, and other gentlemen directors of the company, fixing the secretary's salary at 3001. a-year, and appointing Mr. Marter auditor, with an allowance of ten ieguime per anunsa. The meeting was then made special, and the direcf6rs were authorized to borrow on debentures or bonds any ettm not exceeding in the whole 23,0004 The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.

Mr. Blirks, the secretary, read the report, an abstrAct of whlch.has appeared in Thte Tinwes.- The CArsTeiAN moved its adoption, and congratuleod the shareholdere that a dividend at the rate of 2& per cent. had been earned during the past half-year upon that portion ofth2e line which had been opened. The passenger traffic had boon of a satisfctory description, and the goods traffic, no-ugiswu reqir some, time--- - to deeoj t. ol though it would require somie tiime - to develop it, . would o dgubt yield a fair return upon the capital. The trafo in minerals would very great increase. As Yet onlv one royalty had been opened out, b'ut others would shortly' be opened.
