At the Court at BuckiughamPaace on the 25th inst, pre: sident Her Uost Gracious Majesty, there was read a humble memorial to the Lords of the Admiralty, dated the 8th inst, in the words following:- " Your lMajesty havlng been graeiously pleased, by your Order in Coundl of the 19th of May, 1856, to authorize the appointment of quartermasters of each of the divisions of the oorps of Royal Marines, bat for which class of offioers no provision for half-pay or retirement has been made, and whereas we have had under. consideration Your Majesty' Royal warrant under which the several rates of half-pay and retirement allowance of quarteTMUStroMe Line, -Artillery, and Engineering corps bre regulated, nd we think it reasonable that the quarter. masters of the corps of Royal Mrines should, in considera. tion of the duty performed by them, as well as an encouragement to the staffsergeants and sergeantsof the line from whom the quartermasters are selected, receive a comfortable provision after pretracted service; we do most humbly propose to your Majesty that a rate of half-pay shall be established for this class of offlicers according to the following scale :-Under flveyease service as quartermaster, 3s. per day; above five years as quartermaster, 4s. per day; above 10 years' service as quartermaster, 5s. per day; above 15 years' total service, of which 10 years as quartermaster, 5s 6d. per day; above 20 years' total servicoe, of which 10 years as quartermaster, 6s. per day; above 25 years' total service, of which 10 yers as quartermaster, 7s. per day. Farther, we will most humbly submit that every quartermaster who shal have served an ggregate of 30 years' service (at least 10 years as quartermaster) sall be allowed to retire with the honorary rank of captain, upon thehalf-pay of 10s. per day, provided such retirement is specilly recommendeued for exemplary conduct and faithful servic. In concluadon we would beg to submit that no quartermaster should be entitled to claim retirement after anyperiodof service under 30 years' duration upon the ground of ill-health cont-rated in the service, unless such unfitness shall be supported by satisfactory medical oertificates- a*nd vre beg most huu bl to add that the Lords of SourIjesty's Treasury have expressed their coneurrence inthe whole of the arrangements. "' erMajetyhavingtakentheabovememoriai into oonsideratlon, has boen pleased, by and with the advice of her Privy Council, to approve what is therein proposed, and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are to give the necessary directions therein accordingly. " 'W. L. BATHmsr.T"' HerMajesty's steam troopship Dee, Master-Commander Pollen, left Woolwich yesterday, at 6 am, for Piymouth, laden with a boiler for the 101 screw steamship Donegal, now being built at Devonport, and mahinery for the 51 sBrew team frigate Topaze, the 91 screw steamship Revenge, and the 32 screw steamship Doris, at Pembroke.

The freight ship Spartan arrived off Woolwich Arsenal yesterday from the docks, to ship 300 tons of military 'tores for Hongkong.

Every thing as, however, complete To-morrow is now named for the departure of the first portion, and the remainder in the early part of next week. The folowing general order, dated head-quarters, Kings. ton, Jamaica, June 1, was issued on the embarcation of the -36th Regiment- I'Major-General Bell, commanding the troops in Jamaica, cannot let the 36th Regiment embark without expressing to them the extreme satisfaction their general good conduct and discipline have afforded him since they have been under his oommand. At the late general inspection the MajorGeneral commanding was particularly strtuck with the steadiness of the 36th under arms, the precision of their mnovements, and theirgeneral soliterlike and healthy ap. pesrance-tho more remarkable aSter service of more than aix years in the West Indies-where they have passed through two periods of no ordinary suffering from cholera andyellowr ever, both of which they have borne with patience a cd fortitude To Brevett Major James Nugent, u pon whom the command of the regiment devolved sooa after the close of the Ute epidemic of yelow fever gra credit is due; he ha d'isaed grat ener and activity, and the embarcation of him ent relects the highest eredt upon himself and the olcers under bl comm=nd. The MajorGeneral bids the of5oers, non'comrissoned gfflOers, and Pvts of the 36th farewell, assuing them of Ids g00 wi.M's wherever they go. (Biped) "T. .

ADELPHI T TE. I"t might, eonsistently with the plan laid down in tha, progrmme, the second professionally theatrical trbute to the inemory of the late Mfr. Dougla8 Jerrold took place at he Adelphi Theatre, whore the melodramatfo side of his Iterasycharacterwssexhibitedbytheperformanoeof the: DayandBlaeyedSusan. Thelatter ofthesepieces-origl. n&UyperformedattheSrreyinl829,andsubsequentlyplayed who shall say where nota-was the first workl that rendered Mr. Jerrold famous as a dramatist, and was, inoreover, the progenitor of a long Ist of nautical dramas, all asinferlor to their ancestor as Amadis of Greeoo to Amadi*of Gaul. The Ren Day, originally produced at Drury ane, in the beginning ef 1832, may be placed-though at a lont Interval-second in point of popularity to Backlccycf Susan. As on the occaslon of the " Jerrold performance" at the Haymnrket, the " profession" generally evinoed last ight a strong disposition to ahow all honour td Mr. aerrold's memory. Mr. B. Webster and Madame Celeste, as manager and directress of the theatre, took the part of Martin and Rachel Hayward in the Bent Day,. which they ha studied for the occasion, but the actorm were by no mens= confined to. the Adol2l comwnk.

After the conclusion of the Rent Day, amid the applause of a crowded audience, came the charteristic event of the evening, the performasca of Brck-eyecd Susan, with fr. T. P. Cooke,-or as his Idolators fondly stile him, " Tippy Cooke,"-in the unfading part of Willam. The sudden revelation of Mr. Cooke as the representative of the British tar, ater a long professional career as the impersonator of de-ons and vampires, will always remain asociated in the maemory of the playgoers of the present century, with tho first production of BEck-eyed Susan. Fate seemed to have decreed that there should be a Cooke to do full justicoe to the maritime creations of a Jerrold, and a Jerrold nautically inspired to develope the genius of a Cooke. A series of drarmatic testimonials in honour of Mr. Jerroldwithout the presence of Mr. T. P. Cooke would have been as incomplete as alist of British Sovereigns with William the Conuaeror omitted, Wonderful, indeed, was the appearance of the veteran seaman of the Brtish stze last night.

THiE SEACOi EFESTIYAL. Iast night the general publio were ardmitted at the ordinary prices, and on no previous occsion have the Roya Surrey Gardens been thronged by a grxater multitude. The mmsic-hall vws literaUy crammed, many hundreds of persons being compelled to remain in the grounds, unable to penetrate into the interior of the building. The regimental bands combined with the regular orchestra, under the energetic direction of M Jullien, performed with even greater pirit and accuracy than before. The En2glish Quadrille created the utmost excitement, the pictures of camp life which it so vividly calls up being adm~irably appropriate t' the occasion. The last figure-in which the fifes and drum are piercingly and strikingly conspicunous-was encorecl with enthusiasm. The British Army Quadrille, equally in good keeping, was equally successful; while "Rule Britannia,' " Partant pour la Syrie," and " God savo the Queen,"-in which the lbands and chorus joined with astounding effect-brought the concert to a termination amid the cheers and icclamations of the crowd. There was some admirable singing by Madame Gassier, Madame Rudersdorff (who ain took the chief part In Mendelssoha's Lorely), and Mr. Alan Irving. Madame Gassier executed " Ah non giunge". with snrprising brilHiancy, and in response to the unanimous enoore Fang the populr Venzano WaltU4 with the same talent and the same success A sinilar result rewarded the very capital per. formance, by Mr, Land's chorus, of Pearsall's Genial Norse Melody (" 0 brave were England's mailed knights"). In short, the concert was calculated to afford the utmost gratification, and every piece, vocal or Instrunmental, was foloowed by the loudesb applause. At the end of the first part of the concert there was a universal alU for Mrs. Seacole, wbo, to the surprise and satisfaction of every one, was led forwArd in the orchestra by M. Julien with a galantry as hearty as it was expres. aive. After the seoond part In ans vtr to a slmilarly enthu. siastio suimmons, Mmrs Soole bowed her cknowledgments from her accustomed seatin the gaery.

MOOKE NUISASNCE (SCOTLAND) ABATEMEINT BILL. The House having resolved into committee on this Bill, and the finrsb clause having been read, lIr. BOUVLR1IE opposed the clause. He said that the Bill was founded on the Metropolitan Act, and was practically extended in its operation to the whole of Scotland. As there were certain manufaotures in the process of which it was impossible lo prevent the escape of smoke, he thought fbat the House should not haktily legislate on this matter by a Bill interfeaing,with all parts of Scotland. Those who carried on the manufacture of iron maintained that in the pioceEs of nanufacture the smoke could not be consumed, and a part of Scotland was a large iron-producing district. Be admitted the great advantage which had been produced by the prevention of smoke in the metropolis, but none of i hose peculiar manufactures to which he had referred were to be found in London. Sir T. COLEBROOKE was of opinion that the subject ought to undergo some inquiry before a select committee, and the practicability of putting in force the stringent pro. visions of the Bill should be investigated before the present clause was adopted. Mr. DUNLOP, who had charge of the Bill, said that the zejection of the present clause would be tantamount to the defeat of the Bill. Ho admitted that the measire as drawn would be too extensive in operation, and he had therefore Etven notice of amendments for striking out some of the provisions, and for confining the operation of the measure to towns and populous places. He also thought it reasonable that the Bill should only apply to those cases with respect to which there had been experience on the subject in BAgland. Lord J. STUART expressed his belief that in the county which he represented (Ayrshire) the Bill vas generally approved. Mr. KLNNAIRlD said the measure, which had come down from the other H ouse, had been three months before the country, and it was approved by many of the Scotch members. The Smoke Prevention Act which applied to London lad, he was ssured, worked most satisfactorily, and many persons who had been strong opponents of the measure were now satiEfied of its advantages. He was quite ready to ndopt any reasonable amendments that might be suggested, and ho hoped, therefore, that the hon. member for ilmarneck would not persist in his oppoEition to the BilL Mr. BOUVERIE observed that their experince as to the Operation of a measure of thisnature in England was limited to the metropolis, where particular branches of manufacture only were interfered with; but it must be remembered that in Scotland an enormous oapital was invested in the iron trade, and it was impossible to carry on that manufacture without producing a great deal of smoke. This Bill would Interfere materially with the iron manufacture, and he 'oped the House, before giving it their sanction, would consider the magnitude and importance of the interests involved. He thought public attention had rot been suffi. ciently drawn to the sweeping nature of the measure; for if it had been proposed to apply such a Bil 0o this country the table of the Bouse of Commons would bave been covered with petitions against it, and London would have been crowded with manufacturers who had comue up to defend their rights against legislative interference. M.r BUCHANAN supported the amnendment of the hon. member for Kilmarnock. If this Bill were possed the manufacturers of Scotland would have to expend at least 20 per cent, more than they did at present in the purchase of coal, and they would be placed In an unfair Dosition as compared with the manufacturers of England and Ireland with whom they had to compete. He thought sufficient notice had not leen given to the parties to whom the measure would apply mS to the extent to which it would affect their interests. SirT. ANDERSON believed the BiU was one which was lauch desired by the people of Scotland, and which was likely to be attended with very great advantages. The extension of the use of steam-engines, and the consequent increase of smoke, had of late years rendered some of the maost important towns in Scotland almost uninhabitable. It had, however, been proved in London aand Qther places that oa variety of methods might he adopted for considerably mnitigating the smoke nuisance, and he wis anxious to sse Xthose processes applied to Scotland. The LORD-ADVOCATE regarded the object of the naeasure as one of greatimportance. The mai questions involved in the Bill were, whether it was po:Tible to consume 2msoke, and, if so, at what expense that object could be effected. If the Bil had been introduced at an oarlier period of the session it would, perhaps, havo been desirable o refer it to a select committee; but it had been imder the consideration of the other House for a considerable time, nnd very few representations had been received from Scotland in opposition to its principle. He was persuaded the Bill was practicable; and he would suggesq that it should be allowed to go through committee for the introduotion of amendments, and that due time should be afforded for its consideration before the report was brought up. He might observe that he thought the assent of the Lord-Advocate should be required to prosecutions instituted under the Bill, and that its application should be limited to places containing not lees than 5,000 inhabitants. Mr. KINNAIRD expressed his readiness to assent to the suggestion of the Lord-Advocate. Lord E. HOWARD and Lord LovAU: supported the Lord DUNCAN did not think the provisions of this BiU hbad been sulliciently considered by the people of Scotland. le asked why such a measure should be limited to Scotland, when it must be admitted that the smoke nuisance prevailed to an equal extent in Lancashire and South Wales. lie would propose that the Bil ehould apply to Great Britain and Ireland; for he thought the manufacturers of iron and flax in Scotland might justly complain that this meaLure would place them at a considerable disadvantage as compaied with the iron manufacturers in Staffordshire and south Wales, and the flax manufacturers in Leeds and 33elfast. Clause 1, as amonded, was then agreed to, and the comanittee proceeded to discuss and settle the remnaining clauses, which had reference chiefly to the construction of furnaces with the view to smoke prevention, the manner of making rcomplaints and laying informations against offenders, and 7the recovery and application of penalties. The House tben resumed. CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION. The adjourned debate upon the second reading of thd Superannuation Act Amendment Bill was resmed by Mr. RICH, who commenced by stating that when the :Bill was last before the House he had no intention to speak against time with the view of preventing a division, but the HoUse would not hear him, and heo was therofore compelled to seek another opportunity of making his statement. His objections to the Bill might be summed up in few worzs. He objected to it because it was Imperfect in its form, would be unjust in its operation 'was quite unnecessary, based on erroneous statements, involved an extravagant expenditure of the public money, and recognized a breach of contract. The Bill was imperfect Lbcause, while the public service embraced some 50,000 per- ons, who received salaries amounting in the aggregate to ibetween 7,000,0001. and 8,000,0001. per annum, it referred to 16,000 only, receiving emoluments to the amount of about 2,500,0001., and it touched those persons upon one particular point alone. His reason for calling the Bill un:ust was, that it sought to put a gratuity of 70,0001. a-year, 'which soon wouldrise to 100,0001., imto the pockets of a fraction of the civil servants, without satisfying the claims of the rest; and his objection to the Bill upon this ground was increased by the faet that the 16,000 whom it proposed to henet were Probably the best paid of aU the publio sgrvants. The Bill was unnecessary, because it had not been proved that the persona to whom the House was asked to wote 100,0001. per annum were inadequately paid, all the evidence, indeed, tending in the opposite direction. He maintained that the public service was ably manned by the present officeholders, while in the fact that numerous applications were daily made for appointments he recoaniZed a decisive proof that the salaries were thought umicitly ample. Such, too, was the opinion of the commissioners, ibecause, although they proposed to do away with the abatemients, they likewise recommended that there should b a reAvision-which meant a reduction-of salaries in all cases of new appointments and promotions. The Bill was founded nupou erroneous statements, inasmuch as it was mere asaumptien to say that the engagement entered into by the publc and the Civil servants had been violated by the former, er that the amount of the deductions was greater than the allowances which would ultimately be received by those entitledto them. According tothe statements of the public s iervants themselves, the char a upon the pension frand when all the claims fell in would be about 200,0001. a-year, and the amount of the deductions 94,000. Whether the accumulations formed before the pensions exceeded the deductions would or weuld not make up the difference between 200,0001. and 94,000!. was a question now under the con. sideration of exuerienced actuaries. If the balance should tumr out to be i n favour of tho Government, he was sare that the House would assent to any proposal for either increasing the ] pensions or reducing the abatements; but, in the meantime, there was no foundation for the statement that the civil servants were required to pa :more than they ought. He thought the Bill extravagant, because if, as he contended, the saaries of the publio servants were now'sufficient, every shilling added to them could be nothing else than a pure waste of the public 2noney. Nor was this alL If the House were to grant 100,000!. per annum to the richer and more powerful class of public aervants they could not in fairness withhold a sinilar boon from the weaker and poorer. Now as the salaries received by the latter amounted to about 5A0,0001. a-year, or double the sum paid to the former, the effect of putting the two clsses upon an equality would be to increase the grataity granted by Parliament-for he could call it by no other name-by 200,000!. or perhap 250,0001. In facto what they were now asket to do would be a aerous additiontothe burdens of the country, andmighteven prove a formidable inpediment to the abolition of the cometax The Bill likewise involved a breach of contract. If ever there was a contract clearly made and fairly entered into it was the contract embodied in the Aot of 18S6 That Act had been in open and atisfactory operatilon for upwards of 20 year Durng that time appllcations had been made without end for apgintments to publio offices RJ4 pa4tle3s WeU Wq man Ith UJeprofsions of the Aot. tlhy of thoso -parties had succeeded in their 1tiPvs, and now, when they amounted to a large majortBY oY te public servant3 as compared with those who entered prior to 1829, they fortmed themselves into an association for the express purpose of repudiiting the contract. If the noble lord the member for tookermouth had introduced a Bill for doing away, not with the abatements, but with the pensions, would not the public servants have charged him, and justly, ,with attempting to commit a gross breach of faith ? But was it not equally a breach of faith on the paxt of the public servants to seek to be absolved from the payment of the abatements and at the same time demand the continuance of the pensions? By complying with such a demand the House would legalize a most dangerous principle-dangerous even to the public servants themselves. The in,mediate effect would be a great increase to the expenses of the civil service, and in 1861, when the income-tax came to be reconsidered, the House might in one of its cold fits of economy resolve to do away with retiring allowances altogether. The Bill, if adopted, would vary a principle that had been long observed, viz.-that the rights of the pzesent holders of offices should be respeoted in regard to salaries. He objected to the Bill as impolitic, as unjust, and as likely to lead to extravagance, andltherefore he hoped the House would not agree to the second reading. Lord NAAS said that, having already stated upon introducing the Bill his reasons for so doing, he would confile his remarks upon the present occasion to a reply to certain comments which had been made during the debate. It had been said that the Bill did not call upon the House to decide whether or not abatement should be abolished; but the statement was incorrect, for that was the only question the House was called upon to decide. (Hear.) The Secretary for the Treasury (Mr. Wilson), whose motives in opposing the Bill no one could doubt were very proper, had, however, made some statements offaets andfligures in a manner which tended to create a false impression. The hon. gentleman had stated that it was a misapprehension to suppose that the civl servants of the public were called upon to pay more in deductions than they received back as pensions. That was a matter of fact, and it could be proved beyond all dispute that the contributions of the civil servants far exceeded in amount the pensions that were granted to them. That matter ought to have been set at rest after the evidence which had been taken before the committee which sat last year upon the subject. They examined Dr. Farr, Mr. Edmonds, and Mr. Hardy, actuaries of the highest eminence, and documents were produced,showing that six other distinguished actuaries agreed with them in an opinion that the aversge value of the pensions actually granted was considerably less than what should have been given in return for the contribution paid by the civil servant, even omitting all profits arising from resignations and discharges. It was true that an inquiry was going on, or was supposed to be going on, directed in some measure to that pointb but the evidence before the House would lead them to believe that it was unlikely there would be any different conclusion arrived at than had been come to by the committee. Much had been said in the course of the debate about the present system not being a breach of contract. le had never said it was. He did not think the Government had broken faith 'with the civil servants, nor did he think the civil servants were seeking to depart from any contract they had made with the Government. What he had said and repeated now was that the present system was decidedly bad, and he could not 2how that in better words than by reading to the Houso the words of Sir C. Trevelyan:- "The arrangement is in its nature inequitable, and belongs to that class of bad laws which are contrary to the natural sense of justice of mankind. In criminal jurisprn. dence the effect of such laws is that juries will not convict upon them. In clvil administration the effect is that they obstruct and baffle all our endeavours for the improvement of the civil service,-the fact of the clerk submitting to the condition doesnot make that justice whichisinitsprinciple injustice." That was in a few words, the view which the civil servants took of t is question. The hon. gentleman the Secretary for the Treasury had told the House that the civil servants were perfectly well paid, andthatwithin a fewyearatherehad been mado a large increase in tho salaries of almost every department of the civil service. If that were so-if there had really been a large general increase of salaries within the last few years that would undoubtedly form a very material element in the consideration of the present mea. sure. But what was the fact? Taking the two large Public departments of the Admiralty and the Customs, he tonud that in 834, when the superannuation system first came into operation, the business of the Admiralty was conducted by 199 persons, the total amount of whose salaries was 59,2661., or an average salary of 2971. In 1S66 there were 262 persons employed, with salaries amounting to 74,3851. being an average alary to each person of 283l., actuall less than the average salaries of 1834, although the number of shIps in commission and men employed had largely in creased. In the revenue departmenb he found that in 1834 tho Customs' duties were collected by 4,856 persons, at a cost of 722,507&h the averave annual salary for each person being 1491. In V856 the numher of persons employed had increased to 5,570, and their salaries to 814,0001., but the average of the salaries was only 1461., being 31. less than the average of 1834. (Hear, hear.) In the meantime the value of the imports and exports had risen from 85,393,000l. in 1834 to 291,931,0001. in 1856, and the Customs' revenue had in. creased 3,300,0001. during the same period. Thus, there had actually been a diminution on the average salaries paid while the business of the department had enormously in. creased. As tho hon. gentleman (Mr. Wilson) had told them last Wednesday that there had been a large increase of salaries in almost every department of the public service, he (Lord Naas) would just read to the HIouse a statement madc by a very high authority, which was as follows:- "There had been a large increase of business within the lent few years in all the edespearotments. Exports, 1852, 78,076,8541.; 1856, 115,890,8571. Imports, 1852, 109,345,4091. ; 1856, 172,654,8231. ; and shipping in the same proportion. Notwithstanding this large increaso of business, and notwithstanding there had been a revision of these establishments, which had led to an increase in the salaries and incomes of the leading officers, who had intel. lectual work to perform, there had been little or no increase in the general amount oxpended for salaries. Notwithstanding a large increase of business, there was, instead of as increase, an absolute diminution in amount of Sala- The House would be surprised to fimd that the speaker of those words was the hon. gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury on the 12th of June last. Mr. WILSON.-I said the salarles of all leading officers wre incrmeased. Lord NAAS replied that his motion did not apply only to leading oi3icers. (EHear.) It was intended mainly to apply to officers receiving smal salaries-the poor clerks. (H ear, hear.) The average annual salaries of the 16,000 civil servants who would be affected by this Bill were only 1461. Mr. WILSON reminded the noble lord that the supplemental clerks were not under the in'duence of the Superannuation Act at alL Lord NAAB said, ho made no distinction between one class of servants and another. He was not asking for any increase of salary for officers who already received large salaries, but he was appealing on behalf of those whose average salaries were 1461., and who formed 9-lOths of the class that would be affected by the Bill. (Eear, hear.) He believed he had shown that there had been no general increase of salaries, although there had been a very considerable increase of labour. The hon. gentleman had also told the House that the civil servants of the nublic were paid at higher rates than the clerks in the Bank of Englandfordoingthesamedescription of work. Thatstatemerit, however, had been disposed of by the Governor of the Bank (Mr. Weguehn), who had proved that the average salary of the cl erks in the B~ of England was 1961,, while that of the puLblic civil servants was only 1411. The House must also remember that in the Bank the clerks had their chance of succeeding to the higher positions in the establishment, while in the public offices the chief posts were frequently filled up with persons who had never served in any subordinate capacity, and sometimes even members of that House had been appointed to such offices. (Hear, hear.) The Bank of Englad also gave their clerks superannuatiol allowances wi thout :making any deductions from the clerks salaries on that account. (Hear, hear.) Another objection urged by the hon. gentleman the Secretary of the Treasury against the Bill was that it would produce an indiscriminate increase of salaries throughout tho publio service. The faict was the Bill only applied to a portion of the civi servants-to 16,000 out of 49,000. The hon. gentlctnan should consider this point in connexion with the recommendation of the committee that there ought to be a revision of salaries; and he, for one, could see nothing to prevent such a revision taking place. (Hear.) But the hon. gentleman went on to say that the payments made were in the nature of insurance. Now, what the civil servants complained of was, that they were not in the nature of an insurance at all. Had they been so there would by this time have been more than 1,000,0001. at their dispos, and available for the purposes of insurance. in truth, these payments were not an insurance but a tontine, and one of the worst kind, too, for not more than one in seven ever rece*ved any benefit from it. (Hear, hear.) Then the hoin. gfentle mdan prtocseiended thosaythsat them Tre asur he ha seen several gentlemen connected with the civil any cases in whyich tihe nwidows goft. civile zeolet recommnendedto receive this provision,wbil the applications that were made were always refused. It was positbale there might be exceptional cases, though he did not know of them, hut certainy it was not the general practice of the Treasury toprovide for the widows of those who contributed to thi fun. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman also said that if these abatements were not made into a fund he did not see what difference it could make, as no officer coald receive more than the allowance by Acb of Parliament. But he (Lord Naas) contended that if the deductions were put into a fund there would be this difference-that there would be a gradually increasing sum placed at the disposal of the civil servants, which in course of time would by com- pound interest swell to an enormous amount for their benefLt. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman referred to the Metropoltan Police Fund, and stated that at this moment it was unable to meet the demands upon it. But that was not a case in point. He asked the House to remember that the men who contributed to that fond were a class very distinct from the civil servants of the Crown. They entered the Eervice much older than the civil servants did,-he believed at least 10 years older,-and they retired far sooner. From constant exposureto all weathers and from the nature of the duties in lwhihch they wereemployedtheirconstitutionsbroke down, and they came comparatively early upon the fund, so that the case of the police did not apply to thle one now~ before the House. (Hear.) But the most -extrAordinary statement of the hen, gentleman was that the tota compensation and allowances was now 830,0001., and he made an ingenious calculation to ehow. that there would be a uleficiency of 581,0001. in 1891. In fmakiong this calculation the hon. gentleman took the whole charges for the entire service, mixed up all the charges for pensions and compensatIons and superannuation allowances now granted. BLt what were the lacts of the case? It was shown by a Parlimentry pper tat te toalamount abated from' salaicefro Augst,182, t Janfar, 156,was 843,4331., whie te ota alownce tothse ho adpaid the tax were92,331; ht Iwoul befoud tat heoalculation of thelio. gztteiniiappiedto he hoeservice, This conveyed the ideRt aat the whole of the cvil servants were taaxed for their pensions, whereas the salaries of those who received pensions without paying for them amounted to 4,910,6001., while the salaries of those 'Who paid the tax amounted to 2,426,6991., and moreover the pensions of those who did not pay for them were regulated on a much higher scale than those of the contributors. (Hear, hear.) Ths tax was now 74,2121. per annum, while the annual pensions paid to contributors amounted to 12,000L, that being the whole sum out of the 830,0001. referred to by the hon. gentleman which would be affected by the Bill before the House, while it did not affect the salaries of more than 16,000 servants. (Hear, hear.) He contended that, viewed thus, instead of thero being a deficiency. as the hon, gentleman represented, there would be, from the interest alone on the fund, a large sum in favour of the Exchequer. (Hear.) But the hon. gentleman alladed to the pensions for the army, whicb, he said, amounted to b56,0001. a-year, while the eivil superannuation allowances were 606,0001.; so that the civil servants received a larger amount in pensions than the whole army. But the hon. gentleman- left out altogether the smaU item of 1,169,6581. paid to out-pensioners, and forgot that the total charge for the non-effective service was 2,240.2241. (Hear, hear.) He bad endeavoured to show to the House that the statements of the hon. gentleman on this subject ought to be viewed with caution, and that his inferences and deductions were not such as should be received without considerable allowance. (Hear.) The right hon. gentleman the member for Portsmouth(Sir P. Baring) gave as one of his reasons for supporting the present system of superannuations, that it gave additional security to the civil Eervants; but in this he was at variance with the commissioners, who plainly stated that they did not think the abatements gave any additional security whatever. (Hear, hear.) It had been objected that the Bill before the House did not deal with the whole question, and dtd not carry out all the recommendations of the report of the coimmissioners. Now, the principal recommesdation of the commissioners was " the total abolition of deductions forpurposesof super. annuation, without any corresponding reduction in the salaries on which such deductions are charged." (Hear, hear.) This was the great cardinal recommendation of the commissioners, and it was embodied in his Bill; and he would undertake in 20 minutes to frame clauses that would embrace all that was necessary ii the other recommendations if the House wished it (Hear, hear.) What were those recommendations? They were in the first place that the scale of superannuations recommended by the committee of last year, which did not differ mAterially from that at present in force, should be adopted; tha$ superannuitions should be given at 60 instead of 65, exept in cases of lU-health and that there should be compulsory etirement at 65. Then there were recommendations with egard to gratuLities and compensations on lcs of oflice ,wch did not properly come under the head ef superanuatiob2, and ought to be made the subject of another Bill. (Hcar.hear.) They further recommended that dockyard officers io rose to the second and third classes should be placed on the same footIng as other civil servants-that tfie Poat-offide departmont shouldbe revised, and that extra clerks shouldlba placed on an equality with the others if they served long enough. Now these were matters that the House could very soon make up Its mind upon if it desired to entertain them. nHear.) There were, however, two pointswhich they hadrepo ted upon that would require great attention from the HoF se-vz., that there should be no creation of a fund, and no general revision of salaries. (Hlear, hear.) Those who complained that the measure did not settle the whole! question nor embrace the whole recommendations of the tommissioners ought to hear In mind that their great leading recommendation was contained in his BilL (Eear, he&.) If the Bill did not sweep away all the anomahes and inequalities that existed, still It swept away the most grievous anomaly, and he believed it would pave the way for the *bolition of aU the others. (Hear, hear.) But the question he had now to ask was, what did the Government propose .o do? If he understoodproperly the objections of the Gooernment, they were directed not against the details of the commissioners' recommendations, but the principles they had laid down. He wished to know from the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Government meant to set their face once and for al} against every attempt to do away with the abatements made for superannuation allowances? (Hear, hear.) His decided opinion was that they must make up thefrminds to do away,with these abatements or not deal with the question at *IL QHear, bear.) Tho system had been condemned by I that Rouse, by e press, and by tho good sense of the peoplo of this country. In former times itwasdiscussed and dirapproved by such men as Lord Sidtnouth and Mr. Charles Grant, and by one whoso genius,and eloquence adorned every subject on whichhe spoke (Ir. Canmng, as we understood); and in our own days it had received the condemnation not only of the public, and of a committee of thatHouse, but also of a Royal commission. (Hear.) This tax caused great dissatisfaction among a large and im ortant body of the public servants. They felt theyihad a grievance to complain of, and the House might depend upon it they would not be satisfied till that grievanco was removed. (Hear.) The agitation would go on, and jthey would not rest contented with less than was now prpposed for their relief. Next year the demands of the civil,servants instead of being lessened might be enlarged ("Hear hoar from Mr. Gladstone); and the House might find that it was not one rSievance only they vere called on to redresg, (Hear, hear.) We boasted in this country of the stabilty, the firmness, nd thq integrity with which the business of every deparbsent wvas conducted. These we owed very much to the exertions and abilities of the civil servants of the Crowvn, and he honied that injustice to them the Hous would not now hesitate to put an end to what wras felt to bo a sore and oppressive gtievance. (HIear, Mr. GLADSTONE-I for one admit jmost freely the right of the civil servants of the Crow# to two thingEfirst, to a full and respectful hearing, anc, secondly, to a clear and definitive decision. (Hear, hea.) And I mnst say, as regarde a full and respectful hearing6fom this House, that It was not without surprise I learnod that some remarn had been made in the nature of a complaint,that we did nct come to a deoision on this question on the day when the debate upon it commenced, because I did; not think it was a reasonable demand that a debate of this kind, involving so many details and sch complicated caloulations, and one in which a great number of members take a very deep in. terest, should bel oonfined within a period of three homrs (Hlear, hear.) I thought it was not right In such circum. stances to speak of tactics having been employed to prevent a division upon the subject on that day. Lord NAAS had not used any such expression; all he sWad was that he thougpt the House might have come to a divison that day. Mr. GLADSTONE.-I am glad to heAr that the noble lord did not make use of any such expresuion, and I shall, therefore, say no more on that subject. (,Eear, hoar.) On one point I agree withe noblo lord. It is impossiblethat this House or the Government should hold anything but intelligible language on this question; and I must say that I experience none of the difficulty which the noble lord seems to feel with regard to the intentions of the Government upon it. I have no doubt whatever that It is the intention of the Government to abide firmly in its substanoe by the present system, and thAt they Intend to retain the remuneration of the public servants in the main on its present basis. (Hear, hear.) If they had intended to make great changes in that system, it would bave been their duty to let those intentions ba known to the House; but, judging from the Bill which the Government brought in last year, and from what has since taken place, there can be no doubt, as I have said, that they mean in the main to keep the remnnera. tlion of the public servants as it is; and I have no doubt wa shall hear that intention announced to us by the Chancelor of the Exchequer in the clearest and firmest language (hear, hear); for it is not just or fair to the civil servants, or for the public interest, that any uncertainty should be allowed to exist with regard to the views either of the Government or the House of CommoIns on that point. (Eear, hear.) The noble lord said he was diaposed to regard the report of the commissioners on this question in the light of an arbitration. I must confess it was with somee surprise that I hLeard him use that expression. This House must fall very low indeed if it equres to submit to arbitrators the question what shall bethensoper remuneration to begiven to thepubliecservants. If the responsible officers of the Crown and the representatives of the people are not fit to decide that question without reference to arbitrators, what question are they sit to decide? i Hear, hear.) Is it not the pr'ime purpose of our mission to hear the demands m ade by the Government to enable them toameet the exigencies of the State,and to votetthe sums 'which may be requied? But the noble lord will say that this question oughtt never to have been referred to alloyal eommisslon at all. (Hlear, hear.) I frapokly own my regret that such a course was taken. her are many complicated questons of statistis connected with thoesubject, such as those having reference to. contributions and pensons hie might nave been dealt with by a colmissio, but I think it was a great error to refer anthing ese h ut those minor detals to a commission. I was no party to that step, and I entirely protest ga nt the delegation of one of the prime functions of this Rouse to any Royal commisdon whatever. (Hear, hear.) When this subject was last under discussion the hon. member for Horsham detailed to us, with grat pathos, the case of a widow who had been compolled, upon the lamented death of her husband, to receive his salary subject to deductions, and who never received any benefit from the fund which those deductions went to swell. Bat I mus remind the House that there was a BiU introduced last year which would have met that very eaee, and under tho provisions of which the widow would have received a gratuity, and that that Bill failed to receive tho assent of the House, not on account of the disinclination of the Government, but of those who were acting on behalf of the civil servants. My homn friend, folloving in the steps of the Royal commission, said that the salaries of the public officers had been revised by Sir C. Trevelyan, and that the new salarles had been fixed by him without the smallest reference to the deductions paid by the civil servants. To say that Sir C. Trovelyanis the fixer of the salaries of the public officers is an Idea conceived much in the same spirit as that which governed the noble lord opposite when he said that he looked upon tho report of the Royal commission In thelight of an arbitration. I object to fastening upon Sir C. Trevelyan the responsibility for these salaries. I heard Sir C. Trevelyan give his evidence before the committe, and, as I myself had been the responsible assenting party to the arrangement proposed by him, I at once stated, in the face of the committee, that Sir C. Trovelyan was not the responible -party, but the Finane Minister who had assented i6o the arrarsgements ; and that those salaries had been fixed, not without reference to the deductions, but with express refer.'nce to them. It is not Sir C. Trevelyan whois to be caIed ,Lo accu but the Government of the day who gavo their saent'to the rrangement. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord ays .At we Ais not to suppose that the qtestion raised I iS On of tNi.ndiEa:iiinatP ipzreame of g aries Iam to hear that that is his opinion, but I must say that I can. not possibly distinguish between his Bill and an indiscrimi. nate increase (hear, hear), nor did I ever see a BiU which bore so exclusively that constraction. The noble lord quotes the opinion of the Royal Commissioners, that there ought to be an abolition of the dedactions without a corresponding revision of salaries; but he knows quite well that the recomimendation of the committee of last year was directly in the teeth of the commission. It was to this effect, that the deductions should be abolished, bat that there should bo a corresponding revision of salaries. Against the authority of the commission I place the authority of this House, and I know no reason why the anthority of a committee of this House, presided over by the responsible IMinister of the Crown, and comprising among its membsrs many of the most eminent and experienced men in this House, should be postponed for one moment to the authority of any Royal commission. (Hear, hear.) The House mnst understand, therefore, that tha Bill is in diam'etrical opposition to the committee of theHouse of Commons, and that the committee provided by a clause which they inserted inthe Bili, that there should be an equivalent given to the public, for the abolition of those deductions, in the shape of a decrease of salaries. The noble lord tells us vaguely that it is possible to revise aU political salaries, beginning with that of the Prime Iinister, so as to make a saving greatly exceeding the paltry 70,0001 now asked for. The language of the noble lord appears to me be in the clouds, but his Bill is upon earth; and if we were to call upon an actuary-since they are invited to solve so many qauestions-to turn into figares the value of the noble lord's aeclaration as to the saving which ve might effect by a Iudicious revision of political salaries, I am afrald he would tell us that it vas not capable of being made a matter of calculation. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord says he would bedn his revsion wit the salary of the Prime Minister. hat would he do with it? I suppose he would reduce it. (A gesture of dissent from Lord Haas.) The noble lord shakes his head. I suppose, therefore, that he wouldiancrease it. (Laughter.) This is no laughing matter. There is infection in diseases of this kind, and when yon begin to tamper with the rights of the public upon a scale like this the spirit in which you act is not contented with the food upon which it is first fed, but recads from one subject to another, and rans throogh all the departments of the public expenditure.- (Hear, hear.) We see here the first fruits of a movement which bas appeared in other places. It has been encouraged, I fear, by many votes of this House, but if we give way to it now it will be thefertile parent of many others. The wise heads of the country, I see, have begun to calculate how much they are worth, and it has been shown, I am informed, that the averago value of the Premiership is 3181. a-year. laugh.) Upon this a proral is made that there should i!a considerable increase of political salaries, and that proposal has at any rate, been thought sufficiently practical and sensible to be reodcved with favourable notice by a very Important portion of the press. Do not let us be sarprised, therefore, If we encourage this proceeding, should the result be an augmentaton, or at least a proposal for an augmentation, ofth salaries of the ?olitical offlcers of the State. Bat I take this early opportuiiity of giving notice that if that proposal ever does assume body and substance and make its appearance in this House, I shall be among the first and the la toresistit. (Hear,hear.) I belirve thera is no country in tho world which uses its servants with more liberality thaa England. (Hear.) If there are cases where slaries are inmufilent, those cases are exceptions; but with regard both to salaries and pensions the people of England and this House have ever been most liber (Hear, hear.) The question raised upon this case a p pearS tob raised in this form. It is stated or assumed that the system of making deductions from the salaries of the civil servants with a view to providing fands for superannuation is a system which has been condemned on all hands. It has been condemned, it is said, by a Parliamentary committee, by the Royal commission, anditis assumedto havebeen condemned by the Government. Itwas condemned, lam sorry to say, b the Parliamentary committee-I greatly regret that such should have been the case-it has been condemnedbyaRoyal commission, which I look upon as being of leis authority; whether it has been condemned by the Government or not I am not aware. But the system which at 'present exists was founded under recommendations entitled to qute as much weight as any of the recommendations which have been made in the opposite direction. I wil read to the House the answer given by Sir James Graham on this point before the committee. The right hon. gentleman was asked,- " With regard to tho poliey of making deductions from a salary as an equivalent for a prosPectiva superannuation, do you think that that is a sonnd policy t" And his answer to that question was- " Much higher authorities than I, and authorities which I most respect, namely-those who formed the committee in 1828, and who were some of the ablest and best men that I have ever known in public hfe, such as Mr. Tierney, Mr. A. Baring, Lord Althorpe, Mr. Herries, Mr. Goulburn, and Sir Henry Parnell, all concurred in the opinion which I have adopted, that it is sound in prindple, and in effect is excellent. It acts as a powerful moral check upon the civil servants, as a penalty for misconduct, and as a reward for good conduct. When they retire from age and infirmity, and their caso is brought under the notice of the Treasury, as it is in each individual case specially brought, the heads of departments are bound to give a report as to the past conduct of that individual, and, if it be favourable, it is carried to his credit, and an increased superannuation is given to him. Therefore I think that, both financially and morally, the arrangement is good." Although the world goes onward or backward-which ever it may V at a very considerable pace in these days, I don't think that the House of Commons wil be inclined to put aside the authority of the namnesquoted by moy right hon. friend inLhis answer. (lear.) Thoy were men-eeit of them among the most e rned admintstrators of their day, and one or more of teem had originally belonged to the permanent civil service. The weight of testimony, therefore, in favour of this system is sufficiently strong, not perhaps to induce you to maintain it under all circumstances, but at least entirely to deprive the noble lord of the right of saying that it is a condemned system. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord and those who go with him argue that the pensions which are to be awarded out of the fand accumulated by the deductioRs will not in the long run exhaustthe wholeproceeds of the fund. In the first place that fact has never been proved, and If it had it would not affect the question. The noble lord quoted the opinions of certain actnaries, and he says that these opinions ought to settle the question I but the noble lord was very glad to fall back upon t e Koyai Commissioners as arbitrators when it suited tho purposes of his argument. But the Royal Commissioners do not state that this was a settled fact; on the contrary, in the last page of their report, they treat it as a mattor not yet cleared up. The committee of last year did not treat it as a question which was decided. The right hon. gentleman the member for Portsmouth, a great authority, is dis. tinctly and strongly of opinion that the money value acquired In respect of pensions is greater than the money value paid in deductions. The tnrth is that the whole of this estimate proceeds upon an entirely erroneous apprehension of what took plice when the Super. sunuation Act was passed. It proceeds upon the idea, that by that Act certain persons who had entered the public service after a certain day were to be liable to a deduction from their salaries witha viewto the formationx of a fund for their own benefit exclusively. But that was not the intention of the Bill so far as can be known from the intentions of its authors. Tho letter of the Act contains nothing which tends to support that doctrine, and we have express evidence from my right hon. friend the member for Carlisle, who was the author of the Bill, acting under Lord Grey, to the contrary effect. My right hon. friend, when giving evidence before the committee, was asked,- "Supposing a speCal fund had been created, and it had happened that the payments to that fund were more than enough to meet the charges upon it, would it not have apPeared equitable either to increase the payment to the civil servants, or to reduce the payments which they made to the fund?" And his answer was- " That is not the view that I took at the time, or that I now take. I think that the deduction then made prospectivel was such as would not only cover the payments to be m e to the individuals, but would diminish the dead-weight charge for superannuations generally; and that course was taken in preference to a larger reduction of salary, which would have been made, had not the provisions stood as they now stand in the Act of Parliament."' That statement my right hon. friend has ashb repeated, I believe, in his place in this House. I look upon that as an historical declaration, and if the House will recollect the circumstances of the time at which the Act was passed they will see that that declaration is quite in conformity with them. The tendency of those times was very different from that of our days. There was a strong economical movement going on in the public mind, and the Govern ment of Lord Grey did much to favour that movement, and at the same time to restrain it within salutary bounds. The salaries of high political officers were reduced, and then came the question what was to be done with the salaries of the lower officials Should they be reduced, or should a deduction be Imposed on them which might go towards lightening the burden on the public funds forsuperanunutions9 ynoble friendthe membrfor the city of London, who was then a distingulished member of the Government of Lord Grey, will confirm me in 8aying that it was then declded that hese&~c ductionsshouldbbe imposed upon the civil servants in lieu of a diminution of salary, which would otherwise have taken place, and which would have amounted to much more. (gear, hear.) But really the civil servants are not the only persons to be considered in the matter. We must have some regard for tho public. (Hear, hear.) We must ask omuselves what is the prnciple upon which remuneration istobeallotted for the dischargeoof public duties. We are told that the public pays less liDerally than other establishments, and the case of the Bank has been quoted. The Governor of the Bank himself drew a parallel of this sort. I do not doubt that the Bank is a liberal paymaster, and I do not enter into the question whether there has been an inrease of salaries in the public service or not. In some respects there has been an increase, and In some a decrease. There have been savngs going on by the reduction of important offices, such as commissionerships of Excise and Customs, though they are not the productof the virtue of the present day, but the remainder of a process put in motion 25 years go. The procems of redu. tion was then put into action wih a wise regard for vested Interests, and as those vested interests die out the country obtains the benefit. The disappearance of two or three offices of 1,000. or 2,0001. a-year is not without considerable effect in pLroducing your avenge of 141M. for civil service salaries. gut I deny entirely the justice of any comparison with the Bank, becausethe servants of the Bank, with ver& few exceptions, are employed in what we calU head-work. I asked the Governor of the Bank, before the committee, what proportion of hand labourers there was among those whom he calculated as receiving an average salary of 1861. from the Bank. He could not ve meia very distinct answer, but the fact speaks for itsee. The Bank is fuU of clerks, with a porter or two hero and there to show yon the way ia and out; but is that the case with the 16,000 civil servants? We ar not dealing now with the head-workers at the Trea- suryor the1Home.offic, but with immense departments, partcularly the Customs,t containing many thousands of public servnats who do nothirsglmt manual labour; and it is byrmeans of these that you ecoitrivo to pial down your average to 414 A-Jeer, Eic out all but those who do tho work of the head, and I venture to y you wdll find that average payments in tho publi offioes are considerably larger than those 2nrivateestablishments. (Hear, hear.) I hoi therefore that the lIotue will not be misled by any ft. acy of this kind. I cannot dismiss altogether from my niind tho old idea of the relation which ought to exist between supply and demand. It is all very well to come down here and say with a chivalrous air that it is beneath the Eouse of Commons to inquiro what is tho value of labour in the market, that we ought to be above such considerationL in fixing theo payments of our public servants. That would be all very wepy if we were dcaling with our own private fortunes, but we happen to be dealing with the pablic taxes. (Hear, hear.) The hUlk of these taxes are levAd upon the wages of the labourers of England, which are regulated by supply and demand,; and if the labourer, whether artlau, mnechanlo, or peasant, can obtain no more than his labour Is worth In open market, what right have we to make deductions from tne fruit of his labour, and deliver them to servants of the Crown, according to our own ideas of generosity? There Is no doubt that the civil servant gets at least what his lAbour is worth in the market. Here lot rae draw 46 distinction, Thero is a labour so valuable that you cannot pay for it In money. There are men-who devote themselves to the civil service with so much enthusiasm, with such ability, and with such an entiro absenoe of the ordinary motives wrhich a prospect of fame affords, that it Is impoaible to commend or to pay them too highly. (Eear, hear.) Alen of that order we must set aside. Yon may give them salaries which aro liberal aecordingtothe estimate of the world, butlgraat that such salaries, even in the present liberal humour of Parliament, must fall far short of the value of the servioes which these persons render. I am not here to discredit the civil service in generaL At the same time Tinust say that, so far as my experience has gone, the civil servants of the Crown ae not only not an ill paid, but are having refer. encoto their great mass, a well paid bodyof servanta. (Hear, hear.) Recollect what has happened within the last two yeas. There is no reason to suppose that the candidates presented for employment in the civil service during that period have been inferior to those presented in previous years; but the establishment of the test of an independent examination has led to the rejection of one-third of them as unfit to enter the civil service of the conkry. (Eear, hear.) At any rate, thero is no doubt that theso persons do not enter the civil service by compulsion. After ltoning to the debates in this House one would really saupPse th0t the hallotk which has been abolished as re-ards !ie ta, had been established for the civil servioe (alaugh);that every parish, every hundred, was called upon yearby year to sp ply two or three young men for that service (hear, he*rr 4 and that the grievance of receiving only 1411 per annum, taking tidewaiters and all together, was so great that thera would be a market for substitutes, ad that large payments I would be made to induce persons to relieve the individuals 1 chosen by ballot from this frightful evL It would be needless to detain the House with a description of-what is really the state of the case; but, while the quality of your cands dates iimproving,andtheirqantity undimiihed Iwantto know what will be our justifioation to the taxp ing constituencies, to the labouring classes of Zngland, wifwo accede to theropresentationof the noble lord andpass a Bil which, without referencetomerit, onthe contray,withiadecidedpreference of the higher classes of officers, to whom we are to make a double payment, will place a certain sum in the pocket of every civil servant ? (ear.) Moreover, I cannot admit that this Bill, which proposes to increase the remuneration of tho civil servants at the expense of the public, is substantially a legitimate BilL Of course,-I do not for a moment question the decision which I understand yon Sir, have given that the noble lord is technically j estifed in Introducing a Bil which proposes the abolition of these deductions; bxt, supposing he had asked leave to introduce a Bill, or had given notice of a resolution in eommittee, providing that 75,0001. a-year should be added to the salaries of the civil servants at the expense of the consolidated fund, he would at once have been asked whether ho had the consent of the Crown to his motion, and would have been informed that if he had not that consent it was nct within his competency as a member of Parliament to propose an addition to the burdens of the people. The noble lord is enabled to propose his Bill under cover of a mere technicality. Of oDurse he does not for a moment dispute that the effect of that Bill is preoisely the same as if he in terms imposed a charge upon the consolidated fund. It is precisely the same thing to prevent the deductions reaching that fond and to take them out after they have got there; therefore substantially his purposeis one whichis prohibit by the rules of the House of Commons Are those rules mere technicalities? Is it a mere technical rule which pro. vides that only the Crown shall make to this Souse pro osals which tend to augment the burdens of the people? wM , Sir, I know no rule which is more deeply founded in the spirit of the constitution, which is more obviously re quired, which is more absolutely necessary to prevent the grossest abuses. If you surrender that rule what will fllowv? You will have constituencies in every part of the country acting upon almost every member of this House. (near, hear.) These members ill be more or less disposed to lend a favourable ear to such representAtions; many of them will act simultaneously and vill thus produce what we we always told is a great proof of a strong cencurrence of public opinion. The evil of this will be that the proposals for spending the public money will be made by persons who are not responsible for providin It. (Hear, hear.) You are to-day asking to add 75.001 a-year tothe public charge. That will increase to 100.000., andeventhat is buta small part of the expenditureto which this Bill will lead. The movement will extend to other departments of the public service. This Bill only professes to deal with one-third of the civil servants; when these deductions are abolished will not the other twothirds demiand a similar measure of relief, and how will you reost their claimsY It is au very 'Well fo°r ne, for my noble friend, or for my hon. friend the member Tor Horsham (Mr. S. Fitzgerald), to make fine speeches about equity, generosity, and so forth, and then to pass Bils which impose a charge upon the consolidated fund, but what is my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer todo? We renot called upon to propose a budget next year. We have nothing to do with the embarrassment which I am afaid he wil feel about the month of March or ADrll next. Kay, more, in all probability, when my righthlion. friend proposes au increase of taxes to meet our increased expenditurewe shall allbe ready to rise in our places and make popular speeches sowing the Impolicy of his proposals andthe cruelty of the burdens they entail, visiting upon him the consequences of our own folly and extravagance. (Hear, hear.) I hope that my right hon. friend will hold clear, firm, and strong language upon this subject. (Hear, hear.) I am not speaking noiw orfamendmentsas to details. Do not remindcmeof the case of the widows, becauso T have shown that they would have been provided for if you had not prevented it. Many of the details are susceptible of improvement, but what I am dealing with is the proposal to increase outright and wholesale the salaries of the civil servants who pay deductions. subject only to this variation, that the addition is to be 21. 1Os. per cent. in the case of men receiving 1001. a-year, nd 51. per cent. in the case of those receiving more than that sum I protest against that as being uajust to the public and unsupported by anything which has occtured in former times. I do not say that It is a breach of contract on the part of the clvil servants, because in point of fact, tho public is in the unfortunate position that it makes contracts which bind it, but do not bind its servants. Any man is at liberty to sk for an increase of salary, but the public can never turn upon him and propose its diminution. The noble lord does not deny that every one of these gentlemen has from the first been perfeotly acquainted with the terms upon which he entered the pub lie service. On every ground of justico and expediency I protest against this Bill- but I protest against it most of all upon the ground that it practically, althonrh not intentionally, is a complete evasion of the rule of this House which prohibits private membersfrom propodng augmentatgons of the public bardens, that it takes that function out of the hands of those who are responsible to the country, and that it is our duty, if we wish to maintain a wholesome spirit in the administration of the pable service, to leave that office where It now is-viz., in the hands of Her Majesty's Government. (Cheers.) Mr. DISllAELL-As time is very valuable, and as wo are all anxious to hear the opinion of Her Majesty's nisters, I shall trouble the House for only a few moments; but having taken some part in these debates on previous occasions, I should hardly perform my public dnty if Iwere to remain altogether silent. I shall endeavour to plae the question upon which we are about to vote upon Its right and legitimate footing. I did not, nor do I now understand that the practice of maldng these deductions from the salaries of thecivilservants is really the questionwhich is beforoeus! *With much that the right hon. gentlemau hassaidI entifry agree. Iam preparedto admit that the persons employed in the public service ought to be subject to the same principles as regards supply or demand as are applied to persons in all employments, or to the ordinary relations of life; but that is not so much the question which we are now considering. We know that a particular class of the public service have for a long time felt that an injustice was being dono to them in making them subject to a tax from which their fellow public servants were excluded. It cannot bo denied that 16,000 out of 40,000 public servants are sbject to a particular impost, nor can it be denied that they do not receive the advantage which they have a right to expeot from tho fund of which they are mnulcted, and it cannot be denied, as has been stated by my noble friend, who has treated this subject with great ability (hear, hear), that the arrangements connected with the superannuation fund are, to say the least of them so clumsy that on an averace only one man in ovmry seven who paid tho tax derived any benefit whatever from it. These are, however, matters which have been longdiscussed, and I wiU not presume at thishour,with tho division impending, and the great importance of being favoured with the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer upon the present Bill, to enter into any new diseussion upon these somewhat ancient topics. In fact, these are subjects which have been removed from the discussions of this House by the Government having come forward and au. nounced that they were prepared to legislate upon the subjeot. The Government, after discussions had taken placo in this House, collected that the feeling of the House was in favour of that legislation, and they introduced a Bill upon tho subjectl which, after lying on the table for some time, was referred to a select committee. That committeo reported in favour of the principle which is now advocated bymy noble friend. (Hear, hear.) Imeau the principle that these deductions should not be made fromthe salaries of persons employed in the public service. It is perfectly true that they did not recommend that the slaries of those persons who had had to contribute to the superannuation fund should remain at the same rate as they were at that time. (HIear, hear.) I admit that there was a majority of one against that principle, but whEat I contend is, that no one can deny that a Parliamentary committee has deeided in favour of t4e abolition of deductii fr.om the sares et public s-ervants, UJnder theseeir- cumstances, the House expected that the Government wou once more attempt to leislate upon the subject, and carry into effect tbe pinolpal recommendations, of that commit. tee. (Bear, hear.l The Government, however, did not appear to be satlsfied with the zeport of that committee and they thought it proper that a aubject of such great im ortace should not he precipitately dealt with, ani the te fore submitted the 8ubject to the invest1gatios of y commission. T1he right hon. gentleman te member for th University of Oxford appears much to dssaprove ta pointment of a Rotyal commission to inquire ihto asub' u on which the opinion of Parliament or the policy of Minister ought to be safficient grouna for action, and I atn not disposed to question the soundness of his judgment u that head. Ithink thatoflateyears there has beentoo muck laxity in casting the responsibility which ought properlvt attach to this HousO and to the Government upon se'ed committees &ad sommiisons. (Hear, hear.) Tho von question which is now under 4iscurip if one which nee never have been referred to a committee or a oomSoz at alL (Hear, bear.)

(Rear, hear.) 1 confess I loo' with some distrust to these frequent references to Parli mentary committees; but I look with still more distru upon referring a question to the investigation of a Boy; commission which has already been reported .non by Parliamentary committee. (Hear, hear.) I thin, spealkn generally, that nothing can ben moro unsatisf&ctory to th House or to the country than to attempt by the decision g a Royal commission to set aide a report of a committee s this House. (Elevr, hear.) When, however, I find that Parliamentary committee hzs reported upoin the ubjei now before u, thatb that repozt bac been referred to a Roy comuission which has sanctioned the opinion of the Parli inentry committee upon tho main cuestion, I think th such irresistible authority is brougit to bear upon tl opinion .of the House as to preolude us from recommench ab initio the investigation upon 'which we originallyentere Under these circamstances the Government introducx another BDI; audI must beg the House to remember th that Bill recognized the controverted principle whi is the main feature of the .prewent proposal-namely, th these deductions in the salanes of a certain class of publ servants should be abolisheiL We have that princip thereforo, sanctioned by a Parliamentary cotmnittee, tI by a Boyal commision, and then by Her Majesty's Gover mnent.

No doubt there has been mu aniety and agitation among that particular class of perso who are immediately Interested, and in those who are ce necteo with them, and this no doubt has occupied the serlo attention of tho Government, because they must know th It is most inexpedient that there shoald be any chron discontent among so Wueful a cIss of persoes as the publ servants of the country, arising from the feeling that inju tice was being exercised towards them.

They appear to oonsider that, although the mai prnciple has been admitted, some futther ijaquiry is nece sary into oertain minor details. Now, those details are ni in any way vital to the main issue, and I think, therefol that my noble friend, in asking the House to divide uPC the main question, and thereby put an end to a long anI panful struggle, has adopted a wise and expedient cousm, (Hear, hear.) Well, Sir, it is said that to adopt the cour which Is now proposed by my noble frlend would be to ad. greatly to the public expenditure. I confess that I agre, with the right hon. gentleman opposite that, considern ! Inot oy the present state of our finnees but the gloom3 futuz m prospect with regard to expenditure, it would be most aunwi thoughtlessly to incrase the expenditu" V6 country; but I do notthink that any memberof thiio ispreparedtorefuse to perform an act of juwtice on co iderations of mere economy, nor can it be said, if we ado the principle which is now before us, that we sh be acting upon impulse or without consideration or in quiry. t is said by some that If we put an end to th deductions all those nublic servants who do not share tha boon wll ask for nx increase of Walary. Now, I canno admit the force of that objection, nor do I think that th inference is irresistible. 16,0(D of these servants oomp that these deductions are made from their salaries on t ground that it is not just that they should be subject to tax which the remaining two-thirds of the public serva are exempt from; but Lt by no means follows tt bees these deductions are abolished, thereforethe remaining t thirds, who at present have a superainuation fund hich they may avail themselves, 'will claim an mire of salary. I do not say that the Government 'will be p eluded from revising the salaries of the 16,000; on the con trary, I think that it will be perfectly opea to them to adop that course which they may tbink fit with regard to tha question. (Bear, hear.) I myself am not one of that scho which holds that a revision of the salares of allpublic men from the Prime Minister to the lowest tide waiter-is ellhe desirable or practicable, but I think that an occasional an periodical revision of the salaries paid in the differe branches of the public service might-be expedient. Wi read to the salaries of the high officers of the Stae they have been revlsed within thelst seven or eight yeas some of those salaries have been redaced and some ha been abolished. Now, I csa eee no reason why the salari of those 16,000 civil servants should' mot also andergore ision And should not even be reducd if such a_pr shouki be considered just. That is a matter nhich connexion whatever with the question whether we ought o ought noMto freo the civil service from a tax which previeo disc ons in this House, as well as the investatn committeewandcommissions and the opinionsentertain with re;ard to it by successive Ministries, testify to be impositionwbichisbothunjustandlmwlitic. (Hear.) Und these circumstances I trust my tobe friend wil u this occasion succeed in obtaining the a5sent of the House a measure the operation of which I think wll hbe virtually settle this important question. (Hear.) I mayremind ho members that even should that measure. pass into a law will til be open to the Government to carry out all th other arrangements with respect to the civil service whi bave been recommended by tho various oomit and commissions, or which they' themselves m deem it desirable to introduce- It will be fec in their power to take that course with te co currence of Parliament, and they many even with that sanction revise the alaries of those offcers who wo be affected by theaproposal which is made by my noble fr-e In conclusion, I have only to say that if this Bill be carr the result wrill be to terminate a controversy wvhich is once painful and impolitic, and, believing that to bet cs, I shall gave to the measure my cordial suppo The CHfANCELLOR of the EXCBEQUER.-It app to me that the question 'which has been submitted tot consideration of the House by the noblelord thlememberf Cockermouth in the Bill which is now before us may regarded under three different aspects. It maybe look upon as a question of feeling, asaquestlou of equity, era question of expediency. NWow, if weo viewr it as a question feeling I can only say, that so far as I individually am co cerned, nothing could afford me greater satisfaction t to accede to the motion of the noble lord to make tl addition to the salaries of the civil servants w;hich his B propos. It is my lot to be in daily communication wi the members of that body, and while for many of them entertain the highest respect, my feelings towards others those of friendship and regard. Ii; then, I wrere to gi 'wy to mere personal considerations I could perform act wvhich, to me, would be more gratifyinge than to votef the second reading of this Bill. But, although there may many hon. members who would feel that they were justifi in eiving their votes upon the ground which I have j mentioned, no one 'who has a public daty todischau would venture to yield to the in'duence of mere individx inclination. The Government must therefore be guided elusively by reasons of public policy w"ith respect to the d cision in reference to this Bill at which' they may arrt Now, the next point which we have to consider is whe'th this claim put forward upon the part of the civil service or is not founded upon principles of equity and ij tice. When it was first submitted to Parliament it to the best of my recollection, based altogeth upon that ground. It was treated as a grievance. was put forwa rd as a right. The civi} serv2nts contend that the Governmnent, by a misinterpretationof an Act the Legislaturse, had virtually defrauded them of a porti of the emolauments to which they were entitled.

TBR RsLIGIO-s OUTB1sAE AT Turs.-The following is an extract from a letter received from Tnnis - "Judging by the papers just arrived, I am afraid that the late decapitation of an Israelite for blasphemy has caused an unfavourable impression in Europe, and particalarly in England, towards this country -and I think it, therefore, right, under present ciroumstances, to state that the facts relating to that distressingeventhave been greatly exaggerated and highly coloured, and are partly incorrect. The unfortunate man, who had made himself notorious for his intemperance and violent language, repeatedly cursed the Alahomnedan religion when remonstrated with for endangering the life of a Aloorish child, and when he was at last arrested and brought before the Civil Governor of the city, followed, of course, by a large concourse of Mussulmans, he repeated the curses-cursed their Prophet, as well as the religion of the Governor, the Bey, &c. The Civil Governor, being an old man, and finding that he could not appease either the offender or thecrowd, sent him to the kadi or judge without reflection, in order to get rid of the matter. The affair, once in the eeclesiastical tribunal, it was no longer in the power of the Bey to withdraw and transfer it to his own tribunaL A sentence of death was unhappily pronounced, on the testimony of 80 witnesses, and when the sentence vas transmitted to the Bey, the ' Ulemas' accompanied it vsith a message to the effect that if his Highness did not carry it out he would be laying himself under excommunication, in -which case they, the ' Ulemas,' would resign their respective offices, vhen the people, deeming that they no longer owed allegiance to their ruler, would commit disorders for which they would not hold themselves responsible. The Bey not being prepared for a coup d'etat, having for economical purposes lessened his army, part of which he has tent to the south, to check the Arabs on the frontiers of Algiers, saw himself under the necessity of yielding, i. order to obviate greater embarrassments. I believe that no one feels as much as himself the mortification of having had to yield to the fanatical party, particularly at a time that he was anxious to obtain the goodwil and favourable opinion of England. Such an event will not occur again for he is taking steps to prevent such affairs from being referred to the ecclesiastical tribunal without his previous sanction. As regards, however, the public security, it does not disturb it in the least, It being a matter of law to which any Mussulmau would have been subjected as wel as an Izzaelite."1 VsBITING COmmi=s o0 LADmS a?

ELECTION COMMITTEES. TDQwUTnA The commnittee yesterday resunied the hearing of evidence in support of the petition against the return of MIr. Cobbold. John Wells said, he was the tenant of a beerhouse at Ipswicb, belongiug to Mr. Arthur Cobbold, at a yearly rent of 147. He was canvassed at the last election on behalf of MIr. Adair, but he stated that he was unable to vote for him becauso he was 20. in arrear of his tent. At the time of the election he obtained an agreemer.t from. Mr. Cobbold to hold his houserert free. Hevoted for Mr. Cobbold, andhe had observed that he hated himself for voting against his conscience, bat he believed he would have voted for Mr. Cobbold even without the agreement. Cross-exatmined.-He was to hold the house upon certain terms as to the payment for the license and the purchasing of his beer. The next case taken was that of George Hanley, who was alleged to havo received an exorbitant sum for travelling expenses, and evidence was given that endeavooirs had been made to serve him with a warrant, but that he could not be founid. Thomas Howee, a wire-worker, statea that he had heard a voter named Bateman say on the day of the election that be had no money, and that if he did not get something he should vote for Adair and Marahman. Later in the day Bateman told hins that he had received 31., and was going to vote. Thomas Robert Hughes, the second son of the witnes3 -who was examined on the previous day, corroborated the account given by his father aind brother of the demand they had made and the money they had received from both parties for their travelling expenses from London. Witnezs was living at Ipewich at the time of the election. By the Comurr-x.-le received 41. ls. 4d. for traveling expenses, although he did not come from London. Peter W ilsn, a voter living a short distance from the town, said he had been taken there in a cart by one Barthing. He voted for Cobbold and Selwyn, and half an hour afterwvards he received half a sovereign In a room, which was full of gentlemen, to pay for the cart. Ho gave Farthing 5s. of the money, and then went to a pablichouso and had some beer. He went home 9s. 6d. out of pocket, as he lost some money at tenpins. He could not say whether be or Farthing got the most drunk, but Farthing lost bis hat, and he did not. (Laughter.) On cross-exasnination he said the 10s. vas not given him as a bribe, but for his expenses. George Fairwreather, a coachman, said that on the poUling day he saw Mr. Chevalier take out his purse and give a piece of gold to a voter named Sherman. He said to Mr. Chevalier, " You have bribed that man ," and Mr. Chevalier replied, "Pooh, nooh, fellov " After the electioln Mr. Chevalier asked hfm to get off his box and have something, adding, "S4y nothing about that. It's a parcel of stuff." He refused to take anytbing. MIr. E. Galloway, a chymist, corroborated a portion of the statement of the last witness. William Healy had travelled from Felixtown to Ipswich in a mail-cart, had voted for Cobbold, audhadreceived lOs. for his expenses. Hqohert Symons, a butcher, said that on the day of the election he went to the poll with Mr, Butcher. Ho asked Mr. Butcher if there was anything stirring. Bntcherrenlied, " Say nothing about that nntil after the election, an7 then it shall be all -ibt." He then voted for Cobbold and Selwyn. He he., -sme people remark thaS he had got a good bullock f-or hiss vote. After he had voted he went to Butcher, and told him that if he was going to do anything forhimhemight as well do it tnonce. Butchersaid he could do nothing then, hut at last gave him a ticket, upon which 21. or 31. was written, to get it cashed. He gave it to his son, who eaid it was of no nse, and he then gave it hack. Since the election he had seen Mr. Butcher and M.t Bristoy,but had not been able to get any money from either of them. They only made a fool of hime Cross-examined by MRr. SLADE.-HO did not get a farthing forhis vote, althougehetriedvery hard and lost a good deal of time about it. He did not ask for a bribe, bult fo something for his vote. When be saw Butcher and Guiver, afterhehadvoted, he refnued to leave them antil they gave him sometBing, and then they gave him the ticketS. Some witnesses were then examined upon the question of agency. The committee adjourned before th close of the peti. tioners' case. GLOCESTEB, (CITY). This committee re-assembled atll o'clock yesterdaymorn. Two witnesses having been called to prove that Messrs. Frauklin, Dyer, Butt, and Whithorn had canvassed with Sir H. Carden,a MIr. Pin stated that he had now closed the case in sup. port of the petition. Tbe following evidence was then given on behalf of Sir R. Carden, the sitting member - Captain Bradley stated that Clark, the boatman, had promised his vote without having any inducement whatever held out to him. Nothing was said about Clark's expenses when he made the promise. Joseph Clark denied that Mr. Whithorn had ever given or promised him money for his vote. He did not see Mr Whithorn on the polling day. He had never stated to any. one that he had received money for his expenses. Mr. John Whithnorn said he had never given or offered money to Joseph Clark. He did not see Robert Dowry on the polling day. He was a memberof the deputationwhich invited Alderman Carden to stand in July, 1856. ie had been told that the alderman was likela to come forward. They had heard it from a barrister named Cooke 0.-Grimett, a sawyer, said that about ten weeks ao Dowry told him that Mr. Probert, jun., had offered him 3. to vote for Price and Berkeley, but Dowry said he should votesfor Carden, and that nothing had been either given or promised him for so voting. George Harris corroborated the last witne3ss C. Castell proved that he had canvassed Williams, the pipc-maker, for Sir H. Garden, Xir. John Bntt also said that he had canvassed Williams for Sir H. Carden) but had been unable to obtain a promise from him. Williams wished to show him some damage that had been done to the premises. le advised Williams to see the city surveyor about having it put to rights, and he said he would tell the eurveyor to calL He denied, that he had held out any inducement whatever to Williams to vote. - Mr. John Hanly, the city surveyor, said that Mr. Butt having told him about the damnage done to Williams's premises by some sewerage work, he called upon Williams and toldhim to make a statement in writing, and he would lay it before the committee. He added that he thought the contractor was liable, an,d that Williams was just in time, as the contract was drawing to a close. Mr. Hawkins said he remembered canvassing Mrs. Hatton for her husband's vote for Sir It. Carden, but denied that he had offered her anew dress or anything else for the vote. No such offer had been made in his presence. Mr. George Curtis also denied that he had offered the wife of a voter anything to vote for Sir H. Carden. Charles Reece, a timber porter, said that between 3 and 4 o'clock on the polling day he found "Liverpool Bill" (Griffiths) asleep at a publichcuse. He woke him up, and went with him to the yard near Sir R, Carden's committeoeroom. Several people were in the yard. They saTw Hanman there ; butt he denied tha:t any conversationt took place between Hanman an,d Gritfiths such ?.5 Griffths had stated. They afterwards went to the poll, and Griffiths voted for Price and Carden. He heard all that passed between Griffiths and Hanman. Grifhths was not sober. Mr. Ward, who was present in the yard when Griffiths and Rleece went there, said that Griffiths asked Dr. Eianman for beer, which Hanman refused to give him, but denied that Mr. Hanman had said to him, " Go and vote, and I will give you 21.," or any words to that effect. Witness told Griffiths to go and vote for Carden if he intended to do so. Mr. James Manman also denied that he had used the expressions attributed to him by Grifraths, or that he had offered Griffiths money for his vote. The next case upon which evidence was given was that of the voter Hyatt, and the man mentioned by Hyatt as having made him an offer Of 31. was called, and denied that he had offered Hyatt 31., or any other sum of money to vote for Garden. A shoemaker named Franklin stated that he was with another shoemaker named Wilks on the polling-day, and denied that he had given or offered Wilks 51. or any other sum of money. 'Wilks -was also called, and asserted that he had not been offered or givenany money by Franklin. He voted for Sir R. Carden. A person named Dyer gave a similar denial to the state. ment of the voter Hinton that he had offered him first 51., and then 31. to vote for Sir R. Carden. Sir H. W. Carden was then called and examined by Mr. SLAiDE.-He said there was no foundation whatever for the assertion that he was hereafter to pay a sum of money on account of this election. The auditor's account contained everything that he had paid or intended to pay. He had given strict directions that no recourse should be had to any illegal or improper practices. He said when he consented to stand that he would not boy a single vote, even if by doing so he could gain the election; that he would riot pay 6d. for a vote ; and that he wonld rather retire or lose the election than be returned by anything like bribery. On being cross-examined by Mr. E. JSuES, Sir H. Carden said that when he was applied to by the deputation he consentedto standif they thought there was a good chance of his beingreturned. He was told that the expense would be very moderate, not more than about 4A0 Ho opposed both the Liberal candidates. He expected, although not at first, to be at the head of the polL oe was rather afraid to contest the city when he heard he was to be opposed by Admiral Berkeley, but he said he woald go down and attend a meeting and canvass for a day or two, and then if he found he was well received he would fearlessly enter upon the contest. He accordingly went down and commenced his canvass. A day or two before the election he said to Mr. Lovegrove that he was sure they must want some money, and handed bim a check for 500. Ur. Lovegrove said that was too much, he only wanted 3001. He then took bank the 5001. check, and gave one for 3001. Efo had neither paid nor promised to pay any money on account of the election beyond the amount stated in the accounts of the auditor. Mr. L-ovegrove said he was the sole agent of Sic R. Carden, w,ho gave him strict injunctins at the time of his appointment to do nothing that was not strictly legal. The statement that the windows of Sir H. Carden's committeeroom had been stopped up in order to conceal what took place there was altogether unfounded. The fact was that the room was in such a dilapidated state that he was obliged to have it whitewashed and cleaned; and it contained a couple of sbattered windows, which had some paper or cloth fastened over them ia order to prevent a draught. There was no concealment whatever. The back entrance of the room was kept clear upon the polling day, in otder to enable the messengers to go in and out with the state of the poll. He distinctly denied th%t he had given, or directed to be given, or promised to give, any money, place, or e.aployment to a single voter to influence his vote. He -was mTe frora the canvass that Sir R. Carden would he re- turned, and he was at the head of the poll from tie commencement to the end of the polling, so tha'; there' was no cause to resort to any improper practices. No authority was given to Smith or any one elk, to buy votes for Sir R. Carden. When he liard that. a petin was to be presented against Sir R. Carden, he called a meeting of the party, at which it wa4 determined that a petitlon shotld be presented against Mr. Price, because ft was notorious that there had been bribery to a great extent on the Liberal side. On cross-examination by Wr. JAzXSs. he said he had brought the petition against Mr. Price ready prepared with him to London, and if he had found that no petition was to be presented against Sir R. Carden he should have been content to take it back with him to Glocester. Bis object, however, was to have a full investigation. This being the close of the case for the sitting member, Mr. SLADXi snummed up, submitting that the potitioners d altogether failed to prove their aUlegations. The learned counsel was proceeding to comment upon tho evidence, The ClItAuRL%, inatimated that he needanot trouble himself to continue his address. Mr. B. JANMEs in reply, contended that, although the committee might be of opinion that Sir R. Carden onght tD retain his seat, there was nevertheless good ground for the presentation of the petition as it was well known that a large nsum bd been expended by the Conservative party. The venality of thevoterof Glocester proved at former iaqusiries was atone sufficient to justify a petition. The roomwvas then cleared, and the committee deliberated for a abort time. On the readmission of the public, The CHAiRSivu (Lord ft. Grosvenor) said,-D is the opinion of the committee that Sir Robert Waiter Carden is dauly elected a burgess to serve in the present Parliament for the city of Gloceiter, and thab the evidence in supportof the petition against the return of the said Sir Robert Walter varden was of the most unsatisfactory character. MIr. CLARK then applied to the committee to declare the petition frivolons and vexatious, and was about to address them in support of the application, when The CsrAn f interposed, and said that the comtnittee had given that question a very careful consideration, and determined that they would make no report to the EIouse upon the point. YARMOUTEL At the sitting of the comamittee yesterday morning the cross-examination of ;hr. M'Cuolagh, the sitting member, wsw resumed by Mr. O'MIALLEY. Mr. MI'Cullagh said he had mentioned in the letter to *Eainec that a second Liberal candidate would soon be in the fieldL At the election of 1852 Sir Edward Lcon had a mao ity hi of 80 or 90. He knew Mr. Chapman andbelieved he was at Yarmouth at the time of theelec tion. He wished Mr. Chapman to go to Yarmouth, knowing that he was a popular man, and believing that he mih t be useful. He believed It was in April that Mr. Waktn and he first arranged about standing together. He had comrmunicated with Mfr. Clowes with respect to the deputation, and he introduced Mr. Watkin to the deputation. Nopecuniaryor other arrangement was made between Mr. Wat. kin and himself when it was settled that they should both stand. Re-examained.-The only arrangement was that each of them should pay his fair proportion of the election expenses. Spilling had never canvassed with him, and he -never, directly or indirectly, promised to obtain a situation ,or Ermma. William Robins, a linendraper, was then called, and said that at the time of the election, knowing that alanes was in distress, he had given his wife 3Os. He had no authority from any one to give the money, and he gave it entirely as au act of charity out of his own poclket. Halnes had claimed 31. or 41. for election expenses, which he had refused to pay. Nr. E, Watkin, the other sitting member, was next examined by Mr. JAleES.-He said he had no knowledge, direct or indirect, of any corrupt or illegal practices having been carried on duringl the election, and that he had neither paid aor was liable for any expenses beyond those which appeared in the auditor's accounts. He knew nothing of Spillng, and he had never promised a situation to Enems. He remembered meeting Emms, but when Emma asked for a situation he said it would be impossible to grant his request. He said that if Emmas was a Liberal he hoped he should have his vote, but if he was a Conservative he had better vote for the other candidates Cross-examined by Mr. O'MAAny.-He waS mana ger of the Manchester, Sheffleld, and Lincolnshire Railway Conmp any, and also of the Grimsby Dock Company. He knesw Rundalli,but had never employed him. He knwow mrz' Ashoroft, who went to Yarmnuth on the nomination day and staled there until the election was over. Mr. Asheroft wentthere without hisknowledge. He had heard of areport that Mr. Ashcroft had an oyster barrel full of sovereigns with him, but, of course, it was quite unfounded On re-exaiusnation ir. Watkin said that he had taken no one with him to Yarmonth. ATr. E. JsAns then addressed the committee on behalf of the sitting members, contending that neither of those gentlemen had sanctioned or was cognizant of any illegal practtces during the election; and, whatever opinion the committee might form with regard to some acts of bribery having been committed, they could not, after the evidenco which had been given by the sitting members, hold them responstble for those acts. The learned counsel then commented in detail upon the various cases which had been brought under the notice of the committee. Mr. O'MALLEY having replied upon the whole case, The room was cleared, and the committee deliberated for about two hours.

The prisoner appears to have been mattch attached to hi; victim, but vwas subject to violent fits of jealousy. In ona of these he left her suddenly, while residing in London a*nd proceeded in the Land Transport Corps to the Crimea. ora his geturn bo songht her out, and, finding her near their mati*e place, elvedon, tho intimacy was renewed. h I gunrrel, however, took place a'ouat a week before the manr- der, and he waylaid her as she was going to church and cau her throat with a razor. Since his condemnation the prisoner did not deny hie guilt thongh he seemed disposed,to palliate it by allutsions t, tho condttct of the dedeased towards him. Be istened at. tentively to the exhortations and prayers of the gaol chaplain, the Rev. Mr. Hamilton3, and, though exceedingly ignorant when he first came into the prison, ho was brought at last to some sense of religion. About b week ago hi% father and a brother took their leave of him, and Esine theit he had not been vWisted by any of his friends. Yesterdty he conducted himself with firmness, but with. out bravado, and talked to those abouLt him of his approach. ing doom feretired to rest last night, and enjoyed some hours' sound sleep, but towards tho morning was rather troubled. He arose, attended to the chaplain, and ate his breakfast, after which he proceeded to the chapel where he received the sacrament. Calcraft did not arrive ati the Raul till past 9 o'clook, having come down by the flzsbtrain, and the awful preparations were immediately proceeded with. The criminal, accompanied by tho chaplain. the under-sheriff of the county, ir. Neal, the governor of the gaol, ind other officials, walked firmly through the yard to the scaffold, which he ascended in the same spirit. The cap and rope were speedily adjusted and the boltwithdra-wn. The wretched man strruggled violently for some minutes. The crowd was much larger than attended the xcxcutiov, of Crawley here a mouth ago.

VOTING FOR DIYOBCZ. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-The Marriage and Divorce BiU has passed tho Lords and oome down to the Commons. In the course of its pro. gress petitions and protests for and against it have occupied public attention. The result among many excellent and ,conscientious persons ia a certaia amount of confusion of mind as to the objects and the results of the Bill, insomuch that many appear to think that voting for the BiU is votlng for divorce in general and for facility of divorce in particular. If Mr. Dodd, Mr. Forster, or Mr. Burke, or any of tho oompilers of our Peerage lists, would extract from those aristooratic and popular volumes the names of Al the great families ia which divorces have taken place, end the names of those who legitimately inherit bS the offspring of marriages made after divorce, it would go far 1 owards convincing recalcitrant minds that nothing new is proposed to them except the form by which an already -established result is to be obtained. If those parties who protest against the Divorce Bill can consclentiously say that they do not believe It ever was or *an be in the power of the English Parliament to sever those who have been united by the Chureh; that they do not believe in the power of so enabling them to contrast Eeeond marriages, nor, as a consequence, in the legitimacy of those who bear some of the titles and inherit much of the property of great families in England; if voting members sconsider that the clergymen who, in obedience to decrees of divorce in Parliament, remarried those divorced parties merely went through a vain empty form, for which they are highly censurable before God and man, then In God's name let them vote against the Bill. But if -they believe the past marriages of divorced persons, set down as valid in Registers and Peerages to be valid in point of fact; if they admit the legitimaoy of heirs, made legitimate by legislative divorees; if they admit that the clergy cax remarry divorced persons as they can remarry parties re. leased by the widowhood of death; then they wiU perceive that no more Is asked of them than to transfer to a compe. tent logal eourt a power already acquiesced in by them a, existing in the House of Lords; and, by the transfer of thapower, to render less complicated, less indecent, less ex pensive, and less unjust, the prooeedings by which divorce i3 to be attained. If the actions for c-inm con., the absurd anomalies of the position of separated wives and husbands the terrible scandal of quarrels and struggles persisted in for a series of years, the oppression and lamentable ill-usaga In a multitude of oases quoted by Lords Lyndhurst Broghbam, and othw authorities, appear to them a fit, just, or inevitable condition of things in theee would-be reformlng and progressive times, then let them vote aRainst reform in the marriage laws. But if they believe the state of the Jaw on these matters to be liable to the greatest abuse for want of aome established rule and competent authority, and that the interference of the House of Lords in special and 'wealthy cases in no way mends this condidion oF things, but, on the contrary, produces the strangest anomalies, andereates " confusion worse confounded," thea let them vots for the establishment of a Court of Divoroa, andrefuse any longer to see the sacredness of the ties which fence in peace in our E;nglish homes played for like a gami bler's stake;-no law, no order, no authority; a wild skirmish; a duel of soul instead of bodies; and the House oF Lords releasing a favoured few who can buy freedom fron misery or impunity in sin. I repeat that the question now before the House of Commaens is not a question of the possibility of divorce, but of th'e method of divorce. Is the method of divorce as at present in use in England one that satisfies just, reasonable mbn ?

LOWDON, TtU.RSD.A, JULY 30, 1857. The louse of Commons yesterday having resolved itself into a committee on the Smoke Nuisance (Scotland) Abatement Bill, the clauses were agreed to, after discussion, with certain amendments. The adjourned debate on the second reading of the Superannuation Act Amendment Bill was then resumed. Mr. RICH continued his argument against the Bill, which he opposed as imperfect in its framework, as unjust in its operations, as quite unnecessary, as based upon erroneous statements, as involving a needless and extravagant expenditure of pu-blic mouey, and especially as recognizing and encouraging a breach of contract. Lord NAs replied to some of the statements made by Mr. WiLSON in the previous debate, which he accused of unfairness. Re maintained, in opposition to him, that the contributions of the civil servants had been really far more than equivalent to the pensions paid. He disputed another statement, upon which that gentleman had founded much of his argument, that the civil servants were already perfectly well paid, and that within a few years there had been a large increase of salaries. He argued from his own figures that Mr. WILSON'S calculation, that there would be a large deficiency in 1891 to be supplied by Parliament, was altogether erroneous and that, on the contrary, there would be a large sum in favour of the Exchequer. It was no objection to his Bill, he said, that it did not adopt all the minor recommendations of the commissioners; their principal recommendation was embodied in the BilL. Mr. GLADSTONE admitted the right of the civil servants to two things-a full and respectful hearing, and a clear and definite decision, and he hoped the CHIANCELLOR of the ExcaEQuE would state distinctly that it was-as he did not doubt it was-the intention of the Government to maintaia the systems of remuneration of the civil service mainly as it was. Notwithstanding the disclaimer of Lord NAs, that he did not propose aax in discriminate increase of salaries, he could not distinguish between such increase and his Bill which, in fact, did involve a general increase of salarle%, though upon a partial principle. If this proceeding were encouraged, the House must not be surprised if an early result should be a proposl to augment the salaries of the political officers of the State. An erroneous notion was entertained, he observed, of the intention of the Superannuation Act. Its real intention was that the deductions should be in lieu of a general diminution of salaries. It was all very well to come down with chivalic ideas of generosity; but the House must have some regard for the public, and consider the principle upon whichremunerationshould begivento public servants. This remuneration came out of the produce of the taxes which were paid out of the labour of England, the wages of which were regulated by the law of demand and supply. The civil servants of the CiRowN were, ia his opinion, not an il-paid, but, on the contrary, rather a well-paid claws, and the House would not be just towards the taxpayers of England if it acceded to this Bill, to increase salaries indiscrimninately to the extent of 70,0001. a-year, which, in substance, was, moreover, prohibited by the rules of the House of Commons, without the consent of the CROWN. Mr. DAELr observed that the Government had acknowledged the expediency of leaislatino. upon this subject. They had introduced a Bill which they submitted to a committee, whose report was in favour of the principle contained in the present BilL Not satisfied with this, they submitted the subject to a Royal Commission, whose verdict concurred with the previous recommendation of the Parliamentary committee. As the Government did not move in the matter, Lord NAs had very properly brought forward this Bill, in order to obtain the decision of the House regarding the abolition of the deductions authorized by the existing Act. The CHAwE[LLOR of the EXCHEQUER said the question might be regarded under three aspects-as a question of feeling, or of equity and justice, or of expediency. He utterly disputed the claim of the civil service on the ground of equity and justice, maintaining that the contract in the Act was clear and precise, and that the conditions had been strictly fulfilled. He, moreover, contended that it was utterly impossible to show that if a fund had been created the civil servants would have benefited thereby, and he went over the grounds of the calculation upon this point made by Mr. WnsoN. For other reasons he insisted that a claim upon the footing of justice and equity for a rateable increase of salaries altogether failed. Then with regard to expediency, the committee, in recommedning the abolition of the abatement, also recommended a corresponding reduction of salaries, and the Government Bill gave authrity to the Treasury to revise salaries. The commissioners, who repudiated the claim of the civil service on the ground of right, advised, as the present system was ful of anomalies and otherwise objectionable, the unconditional remission of the abatement. If the House, in a spirit of generosity, was prepared to surrender this sum to the service indiscriminately, without reference to merit, it could do so; but, if not, it might accompany the abolition,bycauing upontheGovernmenttomalce a reduction in salaries equivalent to the abatement. Upon a division the motion for the second reading of the BiU was carried by 171 to 111-a majority of 60 against the Government. Lord J. RuSSELL, in fixing Monday for the second reading of the Oaths Validity Act Amendment Bil, hinted, somewhat obscurely, that Baron Rom}scum might be enabled to take his seat, independently of the Bill. The House having gone into committee upon the Election Petitions Bie, Mr. OSnoBNE gave a history of au alleged sham opposition to his return for Dover which he thought was something approaching an attempt at a corrupt compromise. Before the clauses had been gone through the time alloted to debate had expired. The Earl of MAxcHr reported from the Great Yarmouth Election Committee that hMr. M'CuLLAH and Mr. WATrnr were not duly elected, and that the last was a void election. The House, after some further business, adjourned at five minutes to 6 o'clock.
The House of Commons was agreeably occupied on Tuesday in drawing the portrait of a perfect British officer. Artists of all schools contributed their touches with a variety that left nothing to be desired, and a unanimity which assured a good whole. The British officer ought to be a handsome man, of a good constitution, with genial temper, and the manners of society. He ought to be of a good family, either aristocratic, professional, or at least high mercantile. He ought to have money at command, so as to purchase, if necessary. He ought to be strong, capable of enduring fatigue, an adept at singleatick and the gloves, a good swordsman, a good horseman, and able to work his way through three or four stiff fences in rapid succession. He ought to have a good horse, and to know one when he sees it. He ought to have a quick eye, a ready wit, a manly voice, and a fluent tongue. He ought to be conversant with his pencil, so as to take a sketch or a map flying. He should be able to plan an earthwork, and at the first sight of an advancing foe to indicate the particular point threatened. He ought to have the ordinary education of an English gentleman, to have been carefully instructed in the Christian religion, to have undergone the rite of confirmation, and be prepared to answer the usual medical questions. He ought to be a good linguist, able to speak in at least two modern European languages besides his own, and Hindostanee if intended for Indian service. His stores of memory should not be so much ample as at command, so as to be rather ready for an emergency than abundant at leisure. He ought to have experience, that of war, if possible ; otherwise that of various quarters and the camp. Besides the habits of command, best learnt in regimental service, he ought always. to be ready for Staff dulties; to be able to take an order, and understand one, without blundering ; to lay out a line of march, and to choose a good position, whether for fighting or for quarters. As he occasionally has to ascertain the depth of a river or of a marsh, he ought to swim, and even flounder, with dexterity. He should be sufficiently up to book-keeping to check, and even sometimes undertake, the Commissariat. Besides these accomplishments there are the specialities of the Engineering and Ordnance services, of which any officer who aspires to high command should know as much as possible. This is but an imperfect sketch of a portrait which a host of military authorities the other night found a labour of love. So wel did they work together that each one contributed rather that which might be expected from another tban his own natural share. The civilian threw in the physical gifts; the man of merit recommended a goodfortune, and the hard soldier spoke a word for literary attainments and good manners. Lord PAnsxRsTox summed up, and showed that he had looked on with peculiar delectation. In such an abundance of good qualities it was hard to say where to lay the preference ; so, having pronounced for the necessity, he would not put it so low as the expediency of a good education; he enumerated the three requisites for making a good officer,-general intenigence and the education of a gentleman, professional attainments, and good constitutiona' qualities. Then, repeating the three requisites in the reverse order, he thus "bracketed" in Cambridge fashion the points of a good soldier. Such pictures of military perfection are necessary to keep up the standard, to display a noble profession in its proper light, and to attract the generous and great. Yet one cannot wonder to find an ardent admirer of the profession doubtfully enumerating only five great British officers. Indeed, where are all these qualities to be fQd in i eme man! The " EnglisX aoleiAr," like the " English gentleman," is easily described, but is only complete in the ideal. These painte-s of excellence rather dw:e' on what they want than on what they biad. Alas that the real should fall so far short' of its ideal likeness ! Indeed, it always is so, and there is our difficulty. After a few years of war the great Captain laments the ignorance and inexperience of all around him. Peace returns, and he fills the Army List with relations, friends, and pleasant young fellows. The old soldier is sent out on a distant expedition, and he hopes to find himself there stiU in the bosom of his family. The instructor of a thousand military pupils hates most of all a bookworm or a prig; the disciplinarian sees himself caricatured in the martinet; and even the adventurer finds a mere ooldier a very duLl thing. The reality never satisfies. It does not even satisfy us who look on, much less those on whom it happens to bear hard. The average British officer does not like to be beaten in any way, whether by want of money, or by want of merit, or by want of interest, or by want of opportunity, or by want of years, or by want of birth, or by any want wbatever; and the more the want seems his own fault the less does he like its consequences. We shaU never get either the perfect officer or the perfect system. We have to consider what we can do, and what part of the system is reaLly alterable and improvable. No doubt, education is that part of it which is most in our power, and for it we are most responsible. Yet, till lately, while we have educated for everything or for nothing-while we have taught every class, and exacted from every profession guarantees for its competency-we have left one profession alone to the education of chance-that profession on which we depend for the strength, the glory, the protection, the very existence of our country. This we have left to chance, and we have reaped the fruits of our neglect. The common object of all who spoke at all to the purpose on Tuesday was, that every officer should be educated as weU as possible for his profession. The common fear was lest a merely literary standard should tend to the injury and depreciation of important qualities. It is on this last ground that the system of competitive examination is so much dreaded. We submit that the common object must not be lost in the common fear. It is a very rare thing-if it occurs at all-to hear of British officers being over-educated, or too professionally educated. The scientific soldier is not too often met with in this country. On the contrary, it is plain from the speeches on Tuesday that, whatever men may apprehend for the future, the evil of which they have had most actual experience is official incompetency and downright military ignorance. Soldiers have gone to head-quarters and found ignorance there. They have gone to the Quartermaster-General'soffice and found ignorance there. They have found the Staff ignorant of its duties. They have found Aides-de-Camp incapable of conveying a message. Commanders have regretted deficiencies which it was too late to mend in the very men whose natural qualities' marked them for promotion. They have lamented the little assistance they received from their own youthful relatives. They have declared that they found war the only school, and, of course, a slow one, a costly one, and a bloody one. Now, we may proceed on this common assent to the value of a high military education. It need not interfere with any other quality. The wealthy man and the poor man; the nobleman and the tradesman's son; the fine, high-spirited young fellow and the lad who is sent into the army to make him what he is not; the genius and the dullard; the scholar, the linguist, and the mathematician will all be the better for military education, and none the worse. In fact, education cannot give much, but it can take away still less. As a general rule, our nobility go to the public schools and Universities, where they learn a vast deal more suitable to schoolmasters, to monks, to engineers, or divines; but, though it may not do them much good, who ever heard of it doing them harm, stunting their natural gifts, or disqualifying them for the duties of life? No. The effect of education is much exaggerated by opponents as well as advocates. No young gentleman will be made a bad officer by being taught engineering, even though he may not be made a good one. But if he is a good one naturally he may some day find it very convenient to be able to lay out a camp, a line of march, an order of battle, or a fortification. But a word as to the bugbear which pervaded this debate, and which Generals and civilians alike recoil from. Everybody seems afraid of " com" petitive examination," which has a tendency, it is truly said, to fly too high; and which, to be honestly followed up, entails the promotion of mere paper soldiers. Yet a merely " standard examina" tion" is apt to fall too low, and even degenerate into a form. Now, why may not these be combined, as at our Universities ? There, at the same table and by the same examiners, there are, at the taste of the candidate, both standard and competitive examinations. One provision, the very salt of the examination system, secures the competition from unfairness, and the standard from sinking. It is publicity; and we must confess our surprise that this was not suggested on Tuesday night. No young soldier ought to shrink from a public examination, considering the public nature of his duties and sphere. An hour's vird vooe exaimtination, either before all the world or before a sufficient body of jealous candidates, would always secure us from absolute incompetency, from favouritism, and from injudicious and " discourag" ing" examiners. As for competition, it need only go for as much as it is worth. There is no necessity to give a man a rank or a command because he has taken a first class; but, if the examination is public, and if the proficiency displayed is beyond doubt, the successful candidate for honours will stand rather a better chance. Compel every candidate for a commission and every subaltern to undergo the examination, leaving it to his choice whether it be competitive or not. He will at least have the opportunity of proving qualities that lie hid, and establishing a public claim, if not to promotion, at least to consideration. In this country we need never fear but other merits will always have their due weight; so we shall do no harm, and may do some good, by letting genius and industry plead for themselves.
The resolution adopted by the House of Commons on Monday, at the suggestion of Lord JoN RUSSSLL, is undoubtedly general in its terms. " What idea," Mr. DistAErL asks, " can a "commonplace so vapid give to this country, to "Europe, or to Asia, of the feelings, the "thoughts, and the opinions of the House of " Commons at this moment ?" If the question were intended to extract a reply, it might be answered that the country does not desire that aU the feelings, thoughts, and opinions which may be entertained by different members of the House of Commons should be publicly expressed at the present crisis. Europe and Asia, if they take an interest in the matter, wiU receive fair warning that Parliament is unanimous in the determinatiorL to maintain the Imperial supremacy in Ind',a. It is quite -uauecessary to give any furthe',! informatiow. to, atrangers, ax") ii general it rjay bQ said that a Governmneni involved in agreat military enterprise can scarcely talk too little. Mr. DisRAEI, f denunciations of recent Indian policy have answered the purpose for which they wete intended, in proving that the restless leader of the Opposition is able to get up any subject, and resady to lead any promising agitation. Only the uninitiated will believe that the views which were so luc:idly explained to the House of Commons were thts ripe result of deliberate reflection. The policy of annexation, as pursued by Lord DALnousra and his predecessors, has from its first commencement been liable to criticisms, which derive no additixbnal force from the eircumsnces of the recent mutiny. If Mr. DIsRAB had been impressed at an earlier period with the importance of the opinions wbidl he now expresses, he would certainly not have ieen content to occupy a secondary position in thi' Committee of 1853. A policy which is described as tending to produce disaffection among the princes, the landholders, the people, and the soldiery of India must have been as dangerous four yean& ago as it is now supposed to be disastrous. It is easy to assert that the late outbreak is the result of a political conspiracy, and Mr. hSBRA=i will, no doubt, hail the arrest of the ex-Ei;g of OuDn as a proof of this assertion; but, thesogh that intriguing Prince and his Minister may have sought to fish in the troubled water caused by & military &meute, we wait for further intelligence before we shall be able to convince ourselves that these intriguers were the originators of the scheme to which they, with the dangerous facility of Asiatics, have in all probability merely sought to attach themselves. A part of the effect is known already; the whole complication of causes which have led to the mutiny will possibly never be ascertained. In the meantime it is prudent and statesmanlike at least to avoid exaggeration. It is no part of the duty of the English House of Commons to elevate mutineers into malcontents, or to recognize them as representatives of their race and religion. Rhetoricians may rejoice in. pointing out the anti-climax between an Empire of a hundred millionsandafewcasesof greased cartridges, but those who have to suppress the revolt will act wisely, at first atleast, in taking the grievances of the Sepoys on their own showing. The victories of the loyal troops will tend to make the rebels accessible to reasonable arguments. It will be easy, after all hope of successful .esistance is at an end, to satisfy the military population that there is no intention of converting them to Christiaity by the method of hog's lard and tallow; but it would be impossible to prove that the heir of SIvAJEE had been allowed to adopt a successor; and even Mr. DisRAEU would scarcely propose to disclaim the annexation of Oude. In all controversies wuich require the decision of arms it is desirable that the ostensible issue should be nominal or comparatively immaterial. The real object of both parties is to ascertain their comparativo strength, and the conqueror ought to provide his defeated adversary with a plausible excuse for submission. Even if the supposition that the mutiny arose from political causes had been proved to be correct, the implied censure on the Indian Government would not be less absurd. The policy which has long been pursued in the East has been attacked on innumerable grounds, and defended with more or less success ; but no Minister or Director ever justified any measure or alleged omission by the excuse that the general administration of the Empire must be regulated by a regard to the prejudices of the Bengal Sepoys. In all States worthy of the name the Army must be the servants, and not the rulers, of the Sovereign. It would have been treasonable in a Governor-General to consult the opinions of the Native Regiments before investigating fraudulent land titles, or to make their approval a condition precedent to the conquest of Pegu or to the annexation of Oude. If imprudent interference was practised in the Army itself, if discipline was neglected, or if outbreaks of fanaticism were provoked, the responsible authorities may deserve censure or punishment, but the education of the female children of civilians concerned the miltary department as much and as little as the dethronement of native tyrants. It would be better to abandon India at once than to hold it on condition of adapting the general conduct of the Government to the taste of the Brahmin soldiery. Those who have leisure and inclination to refer to former Indian Debates will probably find that Mrr. DisRAImx and his present supporters took in 1853 an entirely opposite class of objections to the policy of the Indian Government. It was said that too much was spent upon the Army, while money was wanting for the extension of public works, and the authorities were accused, not of violating native prejudices, but of unwillingness to promote the spread of European civilization. Under tbeinfluence of the popular pressure Sir C. WOOD issued a despatch on education, which has done more than any other public document to alarm and irritate the Hindoo population. Any proposal for increasing the number of the QUEEN'S troops in India would have been utterly inconsistent with the demand for an increase of productive expenditure combined with administrative economy. Every additional regiment from England involves a definite charge on the revenue, and in insisting on the legal limitation the Directors have adopted the doctrine of the Indian Reformers, even when they may have been slow in perceiving the existence of a predominant political necessity. Mr. DisRAsu. s speech wiU produce little effect at home, and its results on the Continent, though troublesome and inconvenient, will probably not be seriously injurious. Foreign politicians have always been in the habit of accepting Parliamentary accusations against the Government as national confessions of wrongdoing. Envy and ignorance especially revel in rumours of Indian misgovernment. The revelations of the torture inflicted by native officials, in spite of the opposition of their English superiors, furnished a recent Ultramontane writer with a text for a formal denunciation of the heretical hypocrites who criticize the corporal punishments of Italian prisons. Only a few months ago the King of NAPLES bad the impudence to excuse his own atrocities by an allusion to the supposed tyranny of England in Ireland and in India. The high authority of Mr. DISRAEL Will now be invoked in support of the proposition that our rule in the East has been equally faitbless, oppressive, and suicidal. But the inconveniences which result from free discussion are neither unprecedented nor intolerable. Europe is slowly discovering that in saying the worst of ourselves we are by no means prepared to be taken at our word. It will be generally understood that from the Treasury Bench Mlr. DISRAELI could have delivered as full and as effective an oration in vindication of the Indian Government and in defenew of the policy of annexation. The impression which may be produced on the native population by imprudent speeches in Parlianent is a graver subject of consideration, but me* of those declamations which we sometimes hear in the Upper House is calculated to produce an amount of mischief of which Mr. DIsRKBeL is incapable. Mr. VBRNON SMITH was hardly called upon for a defence of his refusal to supersede the GovernorGeneral by a Commission. It is difflicult to understand the advantage even of the less ambitious Board which has been offered by the Government. to Lord CANNING. All the wisdom and experien. which India contains is already at the dispos4 @ the supreme authorities, and it Is not a time to sena out comparatively uninstructed Englishmen to advise the statesmen on the spot. On the whole, it is not to be regretted that Mr. DLssnA refused to postpone his speech till the arrival of the mail which was so anxiously expected. It was impossible to anticipate any advantage from a public discussion of theories while events were occurring which commanded universal attention and required the exercise of the utmost practical vigour. Any additional facts would uececsarily have been mnade to suit the same 6lleged causes; nor is there any reason to auppose that any remedies for immediate eviis would have been suggested. Of all projects which have been Put forward during the present cris, perbaps the MoP utterly irrational was the proposal of a Royal Proclamation to inform the Princes and people of India that their rights have been infringed and their religion menaced, and that in futture a different policy is to be puraued by a Power which will, for the first time, " respect their laws, their wusages, their customs, and, above all, their "religionc
There is an old, and we believe a very true story, about the great Duke of WrLLIGTOSx, which we would we as our texr for the following remarks. Let not our readers tae it amiss if, in the midst of rumours affecting tke permanence of rer Indian empire, we find tim- to say a word Lbout English schoolboys and their Englidx sports. The two subjects are ittimately con2ected, for, if we would maintain 1bat dominion ts a reality, we mnust use the uame kind )f instruments to preserve it ask were employed for its acquisition. Now, pedants and book-worms never won for us, and sever will keep, the empire of British India. The jsboy about tlie Duke of WRLLINGTON is this :-It is 3aid that in his old age the great chief revisited the playinglelds of Eton. Before his eyes ran the same stream into which as a boy he had plunged, and tred to swin furtber than his fellows. There was the spot onwhich he had won his firt battle igainst a lad who in his manhood struggled s a man should with the world, and who in his leclining years was one of the brightest oenanents of London society. Half a century had passed away. The Duke gazed upon the yell-remembered scene, and for the time the ald warrior was an Eton boy again. He had aot, indeed, forgotten the briliant onset of Assaye, that "simple matter of common sense," as he used himself to call it; nor the long-premeditated heroism of the lines of Torres Vedras, nor the daring manceuvre of Salamanca, nor the crowning glory of Mont St. Jean. We may well suppose-such was the simplicity of his character-that the thought may have crossed his mind, that it was strange that he, who had onea been just like one of those eager schoolboys who were shouting and careering about before his eyes, could have acted that great biography which is called "The Idfe of ARTHUR WELTs.S." He watched for a time in silence the sports in which he had formerly played his part-the glowing health, the generous emulation of the boys -and at last exclaimed, as under the influence of a strong convietion, " Ay ! it was at Eton that "Waterloo was won." Was ever such a testimony borne to the excellence of that public-school system which has had a great part in making England what it is? Far be it from us to disparage the literary and scholastic element in the conduct of these institutions, and, above all, the discipline and the alternate habits of obedience and commaiid which i4 them are enforced. But who will deny that half, possibly the' greatex half, of this worlk is done by the boys themselves outside the school-doors ! During the hours which are devoted to study the great merit of the master is sbown in the method of his teaching and in the strictness with which he requires the execution of the appointed tasks. When the forms are dismissed his discretion and judgment are mainly proved by the encouragement which he gives to aU influences which may tend to the formation of a manly character among the boys. High among these are the out-of-door sports, in which so many generations of English schoolboys have taken delight. The value of these consists not only in their tendency to improve the health and fortify the constitution of the boys. The generous emulationthey inspire, the spirit of self-control and patience which they necessitate, have as much to do with the formation of character as the habits of intellectual discipline which are gained by the more regular instruction of the masters. We should not insist so strongly upon the point but that there is just now a tendency-and we think a most unfortunate oneamong the learned and excellent persons who are charged with the direction of our public schools somewhat to depreciate the advantages derived from these manly sports. If argument were wanting to convince them of error we should be perfectly willing to rest our case upon that strongest of all arguments-the juxtaposition of a French or German schoolboy and of his English compeer. Mark the habits of self-reliance, the vigour of body and mind, which have been engendered in the one by the out-of door life which he has led, and by the seeming anomaly that " he has been left a good deal to himself; " while the undeveloped frame and undecided character of the other tell a very plain tale of injudi. cious confinement, overatrained mind, and of a systematic substitution of the principle of authority for the spirit of independence. Leave, then, we say, English boys to their sports,-experience has shown that sound learning does not suffer from the hours spent in the playing fields. There has, however% arisen some difference of opinion upon this subjeet; The masters of our principal public schools have, we regret to say, expressed their determination. t- put an end to those public trials of skill between the various schools which are the keystone ef the system. The boys will be left, as before, to play with each other in their playing grounds; but school is no more to be matche. against school in friendly fight. The eontest between Eton and Westminster on the river, betweent Eton and Harrow at LOiD'S Cricket-ground, are to those little worlds the great events of ite year. It is on account of these-it, is in no small degree that he may win an honoiued place among -taie " eight" or " the eleven," that the oiglish schoolboy struggles on in comnpetition with his fellows. Extinguish the rivalry between the schools and you do away 'with the great motive to exertion. The same result will follow to the character of the next generation of English schoolboys, if Viese new-fangled notions ar, carried out, as would follow to Englishmen if the Beacon course at Newmarket were ploughed upif Epsom Downs were converted into a site for a reformatory school-if Los2D'a Cricket-ground were devoted for the Aiture exelisively to Cochin China fowls-if evey eight-oar at SEAnre's were brokenr up for firewood, and the Yaoht Club-house at Cowes were used 1ienccforward exclusively as lodgings for respectabls families during their sojoumnin the IsX of Wig"ht.

The one, drawn up by Lord Brotugham and Vaux, makes provision for the registration of the titles of land by the appointment of a registrar-general and a corps of registrars, whose duties are clearly defined, and by whom devisees, heirs-at-law, trustee,, tenants-in-fee, and recently enfranchised persons may be registered. The country will be divided into districts by order in Council for the registration of assurances of realestate.

EXPENES O5' THUE blLiTiA.-Returns moved for by htr. W. Williams and Colonel Greville show that in the year ended the 31st of March last the sum of 8,7341. was paid by the GovernnQent for inedical attendance on the per. manent staff of the militiaregiments of the united kingdom, and about 3501. for the medical examination of recruits for the ine and deserters. It further appears that, wbereas the estimated expense of the embodied militia in 1855-56 was 3,St3,3831., the actual amount expended was only 2,930,8841, so that a net saving of 882,4981. on the amount voted for the embiodied services of the mUitia for. that year remains to be surrendered to the Exchequer in aid of Ways anid Means.

SECOND EDITION. THB TIMBS-OFFICE, Tljur3day Monring. THE INDIA AND CHINA MAILS. We have been favoured with the following detpatch from the Penir1sular and Oriental Com. pany - " The Vectis arrived at Marseilles with the India and China mails at 5 o'clock this morning (Thursday). The mails were to leave for London at 10 a.m." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following in the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday (Wednesday), 6 p.m.:- The Emperor has this moment passed along the Boulevards on his return from Chalon--sur-Marne. A considerable crowd assembled at the Strasburg railroad station and received him with acclamations. A battalion of troops was under arms at the same spot. A detachment of dragoons attended as an escort, but they were sent away; and the Emperor, seated in an open carriage with two of his householda like himself, in plain clothes, unattended by a single trooper, and with merely three or four outriders and grooms, entered Paris. The Boulevards were lined with people, who took off their hats and cheered as he passed. He proceeded at once to St. Cloud. The trial of the Italians for conspiring to assassinate the Emperor will take place on the 6th or 8th of next month; certain formalities prescribed by the law when accused persons are tried by default have to be previously gone through. The Procureur-Generalwill prosecute on behalf of the Crown. The grounds of the indictment are the folowing:- In the early part of the month of June last it came to the knowledge of the police that several Italians were newly arrived in Paris, and had been in frequent communication with Mazzini and other members of the " Central European Committee." The police watched carefully the movements of these men. On the 10th of June three letters from Genoa were seized at the Post-offlce. They were ascertained to proceed from Mazzini. One was addressed to a person named CampaneUa, one of the contributors to Mazzini's paper, L'Italiv del Fopolo the second was addressed to Masarenti, and the third, which consisted only of a few lines, to Tibaldi. In the letter to Czmpanella, Mazzin, after giving instructions apparently relating to the attempt made in Italy, added that it was above all necessary to give every attention to the affair " Pavia"-that thls was the most urgent and the most important, and in fact everything depended on it. He also annoumced that Massarenti had informed him that two men had presented themselves, that if these were good men and true they must get money in order to be able to spend a month at Paris, and that a banker should be applied to. Mazr':,i added that there were' two other men at t At moment also in Paris, but that it was nee isary that each of these groups should act separately and independently, and have no communication with eaoh other. The letter ended by a few words of recommendation to the .Rue Neuve-M6nilmontant, where the proper material would be found. The party to whom that recommendation was addressed was, it appears, Tibaldi, who resided in the Rue Me'niImontant. He was immediately arreated, and his house searched by the polico, who discovered five poniards and 20 pistols loaded. The letter of Mazzini to Massarenti contained instructions of the same kind as those in the letter addressed to Campanella. The letter of Mazzini to Tibaldi was delivered by two men, who were described in it as persons in whom every confidence could be reposed. These two men, Bartolotti and GriUi, had recently come from London, where they had been in constant communication with Mazzini, before the departure of the latter for Genoa. The same day thatTibaldi was arrested Bartolottl and Grilli called at his house. They were received by the police agents, who had been stationed to guard the place, and were at once taken into custody. The search for further proofs was continued, and led to t'he discovery of a copious correspondence, which, it appears, confirmed the indications contained in the letters seized on the 10th. In one letter addressed to the prisoners, the negligence of one of the accomplices is much complained of, and he is informed that the tieux is greatly di3satisfied with his conduct. In the course of his examination by the magistrate Bartolotti is said to have made a complete avowal. He stated that he had two interviews with Mazzini in London, and also with a Frenchman, who, he says, wan Ledru Rollin, and that it was in consequence of these interviews that he was sent to Paris with Grilli. His mission was, he declares, not to make an attempt on the life of the Emperor, but to remain constantly on the watch near the Tuileries, in order to ascertain when His Majesty went out. Grilli at first denied the facts, but afterwards said that, as Bartolotti had confessed, he considered that he himself was released from his oath, and that he should tell all he knew. He avowed the object of his coming to Paris, and that the order he had received was to make the attempt on the Emperor's life. In order to prove the truth of what he said, he mentioned the spot where he had concealed two poniards which Tibaldi had given him-one for himself and the other for Bartolotti. The arms were found in the place indicated. Tibaldi, who has resided in Paris for some years as a mechanic, continues to deny his participation in the plot. The trial, as I have said, is expected to open on the 6th. It will last two days; the prisoners not speaking French, the examination will be conducted through the medium of interpreters. Arnong the papers seized at Genoa relative to the late attempt at insurrection in Naples are several curious documents describing the plans of the MIu ratist faction. It is not probable that these papers, which have been discovered by French police agents, will be allowed to see the light. The Apostolic Nuncio will leave Paris on Saturday next to join the Pope, who has summoned him to his presence. He would have left sooner, but he is waiting for the Emperor's return in order to take leave of His Majesty. The Duke of :Rivas, recently appointed Spanish Ambassador to the Court of France, had an interview to-day with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Government has received a long report from M. de Castillon, the French Consul-General a Tangiers, in which he gives an account of his journey on the coast of Morocco to settle several points connected with the treaty of commerce existing between France and Morocco. The expenses of the camp at Chedons-sur-Marne during its occupation by the troops wfill amoui. to above 4,000,000f., -which will be defrayed by tht ordinary budget of the Minister of War.

My functions have for some time past been dwindling down to those of a mere Couirt newsman, for all topics of political, commercial, or social Interest have been for some weeks iu abeyance in these parts. All the springs and sources of life in Berlin are fast drying up; some of the wells of that peculiar composition known as Berlin water have already set the example, and the rivers have so far followed it that barges can no longer navigate them with full cargoes. There can be no doubt entertained among enlightened persons that the comet that was to have appeared is mainly to blame for this dryness and heat, and the conflagrations of forests and villages, that form just now the order of the day; but, like Mazzini, he takes care to keep at a safe distance from the theatre of his misdoings. If Court news, however, be the only topic left me, it must be admitted at least that Potsdam just now offers materials enough in this line for a letter of greater length than the more important subjects of home and eastern politics -ould admit of appearing in your columns; and, moreover the mere enumerationof all the grand folks 'with only one-half of their titles) -now-collected ,here would exhaust all the capitals in the compositors' cases. Under the influence, there.ore, of these two restrictive considerations, I shall aot allow my enumeration to proceed lower down in 1he scale of humanity than to include a couple or sO )f Prime 3Ministers. As my last letter has already informed you, the Emperor Alexander II. arrived at Potsdaar on Sunlay morning, at 9 o'clock, for, in compliance with bhe fashion which the comet's machinations with the temperature have brought into vogue with travelling Royalty this summer, he had left Weimar in the course of the night, and taken advantage of bhe coolness incidental to the early hours of the day. At the railroad station in Potsdam he was received by the King and all the Royal Princes, with the exception of the Prince of Prussia, who is still in Baden, where the Princess is watching over the reconvalescence of their daughter, the Grand Duchess of Baden. Prince Frederick Wil Ham, who had also followed the fashion of nocturnal railway travelling, had but an hour or two before arrived at Potsdam from Baden, and reached the etation from Sans-Souci in company of the King, who, in common with others of his family and suite that have rank in the Russian army, wore the uniform of his Russian regiment. The Emperor of Russia, on the other hand, wore the uniform of his Prussian regiment. As your readers are probably aware that it is usual on the continent for male relations, and even friends, on meeting after a short separation, to hug and kiss each other, they will imagine the meeting Dn the platform better than I can describe it. On arrival at Sans-Souci the Emperor and his Royal host were received by the Empress-Mother of Russia, the Queen ard Princesses of Prussia, and the consorts of various reigning Princes mnd other notabilities of Germany. As the weather was very beautiful, the temperature agreeable, and the scenery lovely, it may well be imagined that the addition of so many brilliant uniforms of various regiments, and of two nations, combined with the varied hues of the costume of the ladies of the Court, formed a very brilliant ensemble at Sans-Souci. The only feature of the reception at the railway station not provided for in the programme was the presence there of some hundreds of Berliners, who had come out for the day by a cheap excursion train, for it seems a leading doctrine of popular religion here in the summer that Sunday is a day to be devoted to the al freeeo worship of the sun. Almost imnmediately after the arrival of the Emperor and his suite, among whom was Prince Gortschakoff, mass was celebrated after the Greek ritual in the chapel that has been lately fit'ed up for the Emnpress-Motber at Sans-Soucik and I w^as attended by ail the mem.ers. of the Imperial Family, the Princess Ceciliaof Bades, and the entire suites of the Emperor and Ermpress. While this was passiru at Sana-Sonci the King, wwith the whole of thce Prussian RoyalFamily, and a very numerous coe'tfgc of Gene als and other officers of rank, attendcd ilitary Divine service in the open air, m commemnoration of an annual festival. The Riussian Im3perial party here joined the Royal Pn.s6ian group, and in the presence of: the two con.bined galaxies of military pormp anuc female elega'ace the troops defiled past, and then s2fown to an excellent dinner provided for them. in, the open F,ir. After a. dinner en faminle at Saus-Soui-which mear,s a. dinner of some 30 guests, exclusiva of RoWal or Imperial lineage-the party took tsa at an e *f the many lovely spots with which Peosdaxn. 3X' l.o'ds; and to this interestinzg tea party, s.little wa;g out of. Potsda, Prince Gortschakcff andi Baron Manteuffel were honoured with an ivitation. Yesterday morning there was a re:dew held of the Potsdam garrison, in honour of the Emperor of Russia; and to those troops wer aadded the 3d Regiment of Lancers, the present Enperor's regii ment, and the 6th Cuirassiers, the regimnt -which still bears the name of Kaiser Niclaus I. von Russland; but the Grand Duke Michael's regiment, the 4th Hussars, was not among them. While this review was going on the King of Hanover arrived at Potsdam, witi a considerable suite, to swell the springtiVl of Royalty that had set in there. It was understood at first, that it was His Majesty's. intention only to spend a few hours there, but he was subsequently prevailed upon to prolong his stay till the evening. At Brajidenburg the Xing's loss of sight aearly led to his further losing lfe or limb, for on gettingout of the rairway carriage His Majesty misued the step, and, unfortunately, fell with his foot and leg between the carriage and the platformr; but, most happily, he was raised from his perilous position without his havinog received any injuy.. The Xing of Prussia, too,'had a narrow escape one night last week, while taking his usual -iocturnal walk in the gardens of Sans-Souci. The w,eather was very stormy and tempestuous, and, perilrotly unexpectedly to the short-sighted moisarck, an oak tree was blown to the ground by the ,oxce of the atorn, about three paces ahead of the lCH, in. the direction in wilch he was walking.

A letter from Milan says:- " According to the annual return of the expemses of the imnnmiipality, the outlay for the fUes given last winter on the occasion of the visit of the Emperor and Empress of Austria amounted to about 400,000£. The municipil consoil has opened an unlimited credit for the ftr which wil take place in September next for the entry of the Archduke maximilian and the Archduchess Charlotte. At the imperial theatres, La Scala and LA Canobblana, there will be brilliant fites, to which the publio wvll be admitted gratuitously. Popular auinsaments will be given in tha public gardens." A letter from Venice of the 23d inst. mentions that a fatAl accident, which coat severalpersons their lives, took place on the 21st, on the new railway which is being constructed between Coccaglio and Palazzolo. The particulars of the accident had not been received. The last accounts received from Naples agreein announcing the probability that the Sardinian steampacket Cagliariwill be restored to the owners.

TRB DANUBIAN PRINCIPALITIES. (F'ROS OUR OWN OOBRRE3PONnNT.) JASSY, JuLY 18. In my letter of yesterday I brought the history of the European Commission up to the end of its first, or what might be caUled preparatory period, which closes with the nomination of Kaimakans, or provisional governors, who were to govern the Danubian provinces during the action of the commiision there. Six months had passed aince the conclusion of the peace with these preparations, and it was time that the comnaission should begin its work. According to the stipulations of the treaty, the commission was to aseertain the wishes of the population in the two provinces by means of " Divans ad hoc," or assemblies which: were to be convokedby a firman of the Sultan. Very soon after the nomination of the two Kaimakans the project of such a firman wvas communjwated to the representatives of the great Powers at ConstantlnojpI by the late Turikish Ministry. The agitation for and against the union which preceded had concentrated the whole question of the reorganization of the Principalitice in those two watchwords, which thus received a much more extensive -meaningthanthey had at first. When nnion was first mooted it was meant as a purely administrative question, as the arguments used in its support clearly proved, for they were that one central government for both provinces would be infinitely cheaper and much more energetic than twzo; consequently, far more advantageous for Turkey herself. But when the auestion of union or no union was brought on thefield of agitation it was construed into national independence and the contravention of the status qwo. The question once put in this way there eould be no longer a good understanding, and each party worked in this sense. Thua the whole tendency of the first project of the firman was to preclude from the beginning all discussion on the subject. It was not openly expressed, but at the end of the firman a. clause was inserted authorizing the Tarkish Commission to stop all discussion which might be prejudicial to the sovereign rights of the Sultan and the privileges of the provinces. The latter part of this se3tence meant that each of the two provinces having been annexed to the Turkish empire by a separate act, anly 8ttempt at union would be aninfringement of the privileges of the provinces themselves. Knowing what opposition this attempt to prevent the discussion of the union would create on. the side of the representatives of those Powers who were for the union, the Besish,inistry tried tacary their point by a diplomatic manceuvre, which nob only did not succeed, buf which ultimately cost them their plaees. T7he opposition which was preparing looked *o.formidable that the af}air was- dr4gp~ed for the momnent. Be6ides, just abeut the samne time the Bolgrad and Serpents' Island affair had directed attention to another quarter. The Ministry was changed, and Redsch.id Pasha came into powver. Be gave up the idea of forbidding i-n the firman the dksoussiorn .wf the union by the Divans, and took up the true point of view, laid down.in. the Treaty of Paris, the consultation of the wishes of the irihabitanat. The parties who sub-. scribed it had pledged themselves to do so; but that the expression of the wishes of the MoldoWallachians would not be prejudicial to the rights of the Sultan, and that it would be the. duty of the Congress specially convoked to combine the wishes of the population with the rights of t, e Porte. As soon as the new Turkish Mlinistry had relinquaished the idea of stopping the discussion about the union in the firmau the question of the commission, which had come to a standstill, was renewed. As I shall have occasion to speak by and by of the firman itself, I will confine myself here only to the history of it. Very soon afterthe Bolgrad affair was in a fair way towards an arrangement the [conferences about the firman for the convocation of the Divans were resumed. The object of the Unionist members of the conference was to construct aU the dispositions of the-fir- man in such a detailed and precise manner as to' prevent all interference on the side of tho Turkiah and of the local Governments. They forgot that in a country which had been for seven years under a provisional Govermment, and for three under a foreign occupation-a country which had had little or no experience in Parliamentary matters, and was entirely without the light of public opinion-sulch very minute provisions would become the most effectual means for the local Governments to exert an uncontrolable influence. No language is so definite as not to admit of a double interpretation. W-ith the firman in their hands the commissioners, who had bee,n in Constantinople during tho disoussion, but those who had taken no part in it, removed to Bucharest. Thus public activity was only to begin with the convocation of the Divans, but nobody could prevent an underhand influence; the very fact of the presence of the commissioners was Bufficient to excite and maintain party animosity. It would be, of course, difficult, if not impossible, for either party to prove any open partisanship for or against the union, but their whole conduct, if attentively examined, can leave no doubt that they were and are the managers behind the scenes, and whenever any difierence arise:s between the Unionists and Separatists one is sure to find France, Prussia, Ruissia, and Sardinia on the one, and Turkey and Austria on the other side, while tbe English1 enTmisioner lhas to mAe botlh sersible that they L&aN- gone to extreme, and are 6oEA id the wrong. The cause for s daerence of opinmo.was not lon, 'WAnting. The elecwral liet waere o be preed for, the election of the Divans ad hoc, and 250w the evif of having taken up an opinion beforehl,,j manifeats itself. - I The convocation of mtuLh a Divan prepp,sec ra perfect impartiality, guidesd only by the idea to, ascertain the true wis,hes of al2 classes of the- pjopuition, but; sU but one of the &661miissoners iving a special object in view, they giye to every ci.uja of the firman a corresponding intelrzetation. To, increme the confusion it i as found Vt,at owing to local circumstances,, whilch' had not bteu auflicietly taken into account- nz - the dzuiw g; up of the finan, almost every point a s mnitted cUa widtiterpretatien. As I shai 4ave .t speak at Izgth aMout .this double sense of the firman I do't wrish to enter ir,to- te subject on this ? ccasion, a-d r will only q.uete one e±tmple, whic1i wiU be sufflimxit for the purpose.

After- hwing- thwt foiled the attelm* of the Uliionists to, propagate their views, the. 0vernments of Moldavi and Wallachia prepared or' their side to make the' whole mechanism of 'the Gbvermment serve their viewve. Large changes we2e made in all the departments of the public -service, and the posts given to, persons on whose devotion brfe Government eould rety.' As there is no liav gnarateeing-the immovability'of thet Governmentjemnp1oyEs-, except-in the judicial section, nothing couid be'said against the legality of 'thiss. step, however gret thteradvAantages the Govenment derived from it. ' * - ' The prolonged presence- of the Austria arnny belped the Government- cQnsiderably-in thetexee- - tion of these'esures babut it did not prevent the loud complaints which the- partisans of£ the union raised against-the un uinflfenco-exer.eisead.y the' Moldo-Wallachian eavernments. It was, hardj it was perhaps -unfair,, to -hug carry the authority of' the Government to'an extrerae, but it was within the limits of the law, .and nabody could- say. any.-- thing- against-it.- Above all,it was irpolitic. The Austrian occupation was to cease before -the Divans could be convoked, aud, instead of a foreiga army supportiiii th6-polisr of the'Government, a commission of seven gentlemen was to come, four of whom were knowntd. be favzourable to the views of-- the Unionists. Thia-pitcyoffr-epression could, therefore, not be carried. 'out to, the end, while it -is to be expected that as soon as the pressure- was removed the reaetienwouldbe- doubly strong. It .was indirectly making converts t-the union. If it had not been for this mistaken- pplicy, whioh is attri- butable to Asli P.zha's Government and the injudi- . cious pressure of Austria, .the great majority of even the upper classes would. have remained indifferent or inactive. Ther3-were-too many real grievances and evils to be remedied,.whieh would have given.- ample scope for tab display"of political activity.- Inmnediately otters the arrival of the commis. sioners symptoms -of this reaction began to show themselves. Rslieved - front the pressure. of the. . Austrian occupation, and encouraged by the presence of that commission, the IJhionist -party raised its head, snore especially in Wallachias and that for several reasons... 1 told you in one of my - former letters that' the'Turkish Governmennr saw from the first, moment' that it' must concen. trate its effortoagainat the-iaron in Moldavia rather - than Wahlachia.. In the latter opposition was almost hopele':s, for Wallachia, being the larger and. more populous- country, had only to gain by theunion, and it- would- have been. difficult- to persuade the- people there that an- annexation of Moldaviav. could. be an evil or disadvantage to- them.. Besides,. Bucharest being the seat of 'th commission, the Unionists, who zium- bered the majority of its members among theLnsup-. porters, wer* left mu-li more free to stir and busy. themselves abroad. ,hi Moldavia, on the co-trary,' where the local Government had only tosexpept flying visibs from th onemissioners sand had only to grapple w ith the esident agents of tho :loniast Powers, the thing was different. Moldavia, since. the cessica of Bessanikia to the Thissians, 'iad sunk into the background. Origin4lly. the larer and more powerful country, it had not only uzalay had the upper hand in the feuds between the. two countrice, which form such a& promincAt. feature .- in the. history of both, but it . hr 1ik-ewisekopposed a more affective resisance to ihe. Turks, and wben it at ist submitted, 130 yeas afterVWal- Iachia, it was nct in consequence o£ s 'defest, but:. voluntsrily; hence it has up to this. dav the pre-. cedence- of 'Wallachia in all Turkish, oflicial docu-'. ments, and t all. audienc,3. at. tho Sultanas thePrince of the ltter countryyields thsipas to that of' the forner. ARl these circraistancei contrilbuted tot arouse the Reling of & distinct MIoldavian nationality, espacially in thc Boyard fes, whkch woulfE ba easily takUen advantag& of as an istrpinc-t againat the union. One coutld represezt the. anion as a, natiQnE%l degradation, which was only coveted byi the Wallau'hians beca4so they bd gre4 advam,ea to gain by it, not only as a :avion, 'but likewise. in their iadividual cspacity. This w as so much the, more easaly-believed as theWAllaeh-]aixBoysxd&are generally in a muchw,worse crndition vith respect to. their fotunes thark those ,f 3IolJavia. There is scarcely a large property in the former countrywhich is not inowgaged, wrhile ia Moldavia this is, much more rare' the cans. Then, tbe Wallachianm have mtuch mome generally the c0,aractem of placehunters than tlwe 1,4laidans, Under these con, ditions it was. not difilalt to coeate an apprehensionk among the AMdavian, Boyar.is thait the union once made, in which camt WaiF hia will always have6 the lead, they -would be almost excluded from all participaUon in, the joint government of' the two province and, tus .be deprived of thb opportuaity to mrnean their own affairs as they, understood them. The working, up of this Moldavian feeling forMs the keystone of the policy of the Porte in the principalities, and suTely, in face of the present agitation, sbe cannot be reproached for such a policy. tis all her steps you see the tendency of letting t}is feelMg of Moldavian natioinality work for her, and of appearing thus as the champion of tha weaker against the stronger. - The elections for the Divans gave both parties thia first open opportunity of measuring their ttrengtl&.

INDIA AND CHINA. The following despatch was received yesterday at the Foreign-office from the British Vice-Consul at Trieste. It adds little to the inteUigence which has already appeared in our columns:- 1 ALEXANzD1IA, JuLY 22. "The India mail brings no authentic accounts of the capture of Delhi. It was not taken on the 10th ult., when General Barnard, having repulsed two sorties, was waiting reinforcements, which must have since joined. A letter from Banny and Co., dated Madras, the 27th of June, states positively that official inteUigence had reached Madras the previous day of the fall of Delhi; but this is not confirmed from Bombay on July the 1st. " The mutiny had spread considerably in the Bengal armay, though it is not even now so general as might have been expected. " At Benares, in attempting to disarm the 37th Native Infantry, the greater part of the Sikhs and the 13th Irregular Cavalry joined the mutineers. "On June 14 the ex-King of Oude, implicated in the conspiracy by intercepted papers, was lodged in the Fort Wiliam, and his followers disarmed. On the same day the native troops at Barrackpore and Calcutta were quietly disarmed. "English troops are arriving fast. "An Act has been passed by the Legislative Counoil for placing the Indian press under license, to be withdrawn at pleasure. " In the Madras and Bombay Presidencies all remains quiet; the only disurbances being a matiny of the 1st N~yzanisa (query PTizam's) Cavalry at Turungabad (queiy Fm'unhabad), promptly put d"own by a Bombay colwnn.

CANADA. (By ELECTRIC AND INTERNATIONAL TLGRAPn.) LIVERPOOL, JULY 29. The Canadian Steamship Company's Royal mail steamship Anglo-Saxon has arrived from Quebec with dates to the 18th inst. Her advices are devoid of interest. The Trinity Board have removed from the list of plots Jean Leon Roy, who ran the steamship Canadian ashore on the 1st ult. The Hon. J. A. lvMacdonald, Attorney-General of Canada, was passenger by the Anglo-Saxon. The stock of lumber in Quebec had increased considerably, especially white pine, which hung heavily on the market, although rafts of a large average and good make and quality found buyers at a high figure. Good rafts of 50 to 55 feet had realized 6d. to 6id.; inferior the same average, were offered at 4d. to 5d.; and large sizes of good quality comimanded from7d. to 9d. A good deal of new timber was arriving, and all the old had been miostly shipped. In red pine little doing, and prices declining. Stook of old oak pretty heavy, and little new arrived, and the demand by no means as heavy as was anticipated. Elm moving off at better prices and active ; 17d. for about 47 feet, 19id. for 54 feet, and 12id. for 40 feet. Staves had been shipped In large quantities, and the stock of staves was bare; but the new supplyrwas arriving, and prices receding a little. Some standards had been sold at 51. lOs., but a lot of good West Indian wasrefused at 471. Deoals unchanged. Freights.- 30s. for the Bristol Channel, 28s. Sd. for the Clyde, 28s. for Liverpool.

LiVERPOOL, July 29.-The Philadelphia Comapany's fine screw steamship City of Baltimore sailed to-day for New York with 110 oabin and a large complement of steerage passengers. The screw steamer Indian, belonging to the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company, sailed to-day for Quebec and Montreal with the Canadian mails and 107 cabin and 149 steerage passengers. The Royal Mail steamship Canada w.ill sail for Hlalifax and Boston on Saturday next, anid onl Wednesday the Colins mail steamship Columbia will leave for New York.

AMERICA. (A summary of the following, received by elecrie tlegraph, appeared in our xecond edition of yesterday .-] LIVERPOO4 JuLy 29. The 'United State' mail steamship Columbia, Bailey commander, -with advices from New York to the 18th inst., $100,000 in specie on freight, and 44 passengers, arrived here this morning. On the 21st inst., in lat. 40.30, long. 55, a Fxench frigate was perceived, steering north-west. The Royal Mail steamship America, hence, arrived at Boston on the 17th. She had been detained for some hours by a thick fog. There is very little news of general Interest by this arrival. 'Under date of Washington, July 17, the New York lerald publishes the following:- "The President receivea a telegraphic despatch this momnIng, dated at Leavenworth yesteiday, from Governor Walker, stating that a serious insurrection had broken out at Lawrence, andthat he had called out the United States' troops to suppressit. The Governor had started immediately for Lawrence, The cause of the outbreak is not known, but it is supposed to have originated from opposition to some of theterritorial laws-probably the tax law. The receipt of this news has caused some little excitement In certain quarters. The Cabinet were in session until a late hour this evening, andI doubt not this subjeot wasprominentlybefore them." Advices from St. Louis of the 17th state that the Democrat has advices from Kansas, announcing that Governor Walker had issued a proclamation declarimg his intention to put down all opposition to the territorial laws by force, and censuring the citizens of Lawrence, and warning them not to organize under the Topeka charter. Seven hufidred troops are rumoured to have been ordered to march against Lawrence, and Walker is said to have a design to retain the army in 'Kansas, and to break up the Utah expedition. It is stated that the Secretary of War contemplates sending Colonel Johnion, now} in Texas, to Utah, instead of General Harney. The change is said to be necessary owing to the troubles that are apprehended in Kansas in case he should leave the territory. The New York Herald's Washington correspondent writes that,- " Advices have been received here from Costa Rica, via Pansma, which state that President Mora had declared the grant of the Nicaragua transib route, conceded by that republic and Nicaragua jointly to mr. Webster, to have lapsed from a non-compliance with its conditions by the grantee. The lapse was occasioned by the non-payment of the stipulated $500,000 on or before the 1st day of June. It hasbeen determined that as soon as the new Government of LNicaragua should be consolidated the two Republics will send commissioners to this country to negotiate a sale of the grant and the immediate opening of interoceanic communication by it." The President made the following appointments on the 16th:- "Richard Kidden Meade, of Virginia, Envoy Ertraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Empire of Brazil, in place of Wlliam Trousdale, of Tennessee, the present incumbent; Benjamin F. Angel, of Now York, Minister Resident to Sweden, in place of Francis Schroeder, of Rhode Island, recalled at his own request; Mirabeau B* Laamar, of Texas, Minister Resident to the Argentine Confederation, in place of James A. Peden, of Florida, the present incumbent; Wyman B. S. Moor, of Maine, ConsulGeneral for the British North American Provinces, from tho Lst of September next, in place of Israel D. Andrews, of Maine, rcsigned ; William Previtt, of Ohio, Consul at Valparaiso, to fill the existiDg vacancy; HOcny Owner, of California, Consul to Tahiti, Society Islands, in place of W. H. KeUey, of Massachusetts, the present incumbent; John F. Porteus, of South Carolina, Consul at Oporto, Portugal, in place of Nicholas Pike, of New York, the present incumbent; Charles Glantz, of Pennsylvania Consul at Stettin, Prussia, in place of Frederic Schullord, who is not a citizen ofthe United States; Samuel E. pabens, Cosurl at Cayenne, to fill the existing vacancy; Francis M. Weems, of Moirida, Consul at Santa Martha, New Granada, Lo fill the vacancy; James C. Derickson, of Marland, commercial agent at Apia, Navigators Island, in place of Mr. Jen. kins; Moses Jessurun, of New York, Consul at Curacoa, West Indies, to fill the vacancy; Charles E. Flandrear, Associate Justice of the United States' Court for the territory of Minnesota, in place of Pettit, resigned." Mr. Eames, UJnited States' Minister at Venezuela, had arrived at Washington and had a short inter- iew with the Secretaryof State. The report that that Government had refused to exohange ratifications of the new treaty, in view of the position of the United States' Government in reference to Aves Islandelaim, is contradicted. Lord Napier, our Ambassador, had attended the anniversary of the Alumni Association of Havard College, which had been celebrated at Cambrldge, Massachusetts. The banquet was attended by a large number of gentlemen renowned in letters and science, among whom was Mr. Edward Everett, who delivered an address which is said to have been considered one of his highest efforts in oration. Lord Napier, during his address, was greeted with much applause. It was in tone and sentiment similar to that which he delivered some time ago before the St. George's Society of New York ; full of modesty and aood feeling. Alluding to the invitation which had been given to him he said,- " He not only recognized the hospitality of the nation, which was always bestowed before it was deserved, but a manifestation of that affection for England which was idndled in the recesses of the Ameriean heart, and which was ever bursting forth in some act of courtesy and assistance. He saw in the reception, too, in the language of the President, and their response, a sign of respect for Her Majesty the Queen-for the ancient crown which was so gently and so wisely worn." His Lordship went to Boston incoy., and to Cambridge unattended and unlnown. The crops are spoken of in the most favourable manner. The Netv York lierald, in a leader, says:- "The accounts which are coming in daily from the West promise that greatest of all blessings-cheap bread. True, the wheat and oorn are late, the latter especially, and without six weeks of fine weather the corn may fall far short of an average crop. But a great portion of the wheat is already beyond the reach of harm, and the rest soon will be. And really after the weather we have had, it is but reasonable to expect some fine days now. The hay has been plentiful and wholesome; most of it is now comfortably housed." It prognosticates that before the winter passes they may have flour at $4 a barrel once more. At Quebec, the coroner's jury had returned a verdict of " Manslaughter" against Wilson, the owner of the steamer Montreal; Rudolph, the captain; Derval, the pilot; and Roberge, the mate. They also strongly censure Mr. Wilson, sen., the controlling agent. The stringent enforcement ofthe steamboat law was recommended. Additional particulars from -Mexico state that only two vessels of war were at Vera Cruz-a Spanish steamer, some time in port, and an English brig. A warm reception was preparing for the threatened Spamish fleet. Don Diego Alvarez has been elected Governor of the State Guerrero. Senor Plamon, late Governor of the State of Vera Cruz, has been re-elected. Generally the results of the elections had been to place men of thoroughly liberal views in office. Mejia, a noted revolutionary partisan, had been captured, and his forces completely disbanded. General Alvarez had dispersed the revolted Indians at Chilapa. Railroad enter- prises were attracting much attention. The road to Guadalupe had been finished and the opening celebration was to have taken place on the 4th inst. Attention was being turned to a new route for the Vera Cruz Railroad-viz., to effect a connexion with the city of Mexico by .a branch leading from near the middle of the Vera Cruz and Acapulco road, and thus save the building of about one-half of either road, as well as by this road reaching the city of Mexico by a lower grade than is possible by any other line, Don Manual Escardon, the richest banker in Mexico, had recently taken a large interest in one of the railroads now building, and it was expected would embark very heavily in the Vera Cruz road. * GeneraUy, it is said, a disposition to embark in the great industrial enterprises and improvements of the age seems to be manifestly taking the place of that feverish desire for poHtical change which has so long proved a curse to Mexico, and has been the great bar to her progress. Dates from Belize of the 20th uilt. state that Colonel Kenney, of Greytown, was at Ruatan, and found much favour with the negro population. The colonial official address of England was still adhered to in the superscription of all letters sent to Her Majesty's and other officers at Ruatan. Native sugar was extensively cultivated around Belize, and but for the lay habits of the free negroes the people of the colony wrould soon export that article. The mahogany trade wfas delining, and other osquroe of industrial profit wero rapidly failing all over the Bay Islands. Dates from Havannah to the 10th inst. report an unchanged sugar-market. Wet weather and bigh winds. Guanabacoa had been visited by a severe storm, which destroyed fences and did considerable damage. The expedition to Mexico, it is thought, has been abandoned. The British steamer Dee was in port with $2,500,000 in specie from Vera Cruz for England, The New York commercial advices report trade generaly as being dull, though there were symptoms of an early improvement. It was believed that the ensuig autumn would inaugurate one of the most active seasons in the business world for some years past. There was no material change in prices of the leading commodities under the new tariff as yet. The stock-market had taken a turn in favour of the buyer, though there was a feeling of confidence :n higher prices in the future for nearly all the leading securities. At the first board Erie opened At S2+ and closed at 31k, and 13eading closed at 77. tn State loans there had been no large transactions. Missouri Sixes were sold at 784 to 79, in small accounts. Californias had declined to nearly 60 per cent. discount. A moderate demand prevailed for money, and the market was in a comfortable position. The current figures were 8 to 9 and 10 per cent. for prime 60 days' to six months' paper; 12 to 15 per cent. for fair names, according to maturity, and 7 per cent. on call. The rates of foreign exchange were firm, buit there was little activity. Bils on London were quoted at 109i, 60 days', and at 11O at sight; on Paris, 5f. 20c. to 6f. 15c. Il cotton a further advance of c. to Jo. had been established on.the current qualities, but the business had been extremely light owinig to the high rates to which prices had attained. The weather in the cotton-growing districts was reported favourable for the new crop. An increased demand had prevailed for flour, in part speculative, and with continue; light receipts. Prices had advanced 10 to 15 per cent. The quotations for pork showed an advance, but beef remained dull, and prices without variation. There was a fair inquiry for the various descriptions of iron, and Scotch pig was realizing $30to $31. The market for freight was without important change. The latest despatch from New Orleans quotes middling at that port 14-ic., freight id. Receipts and stock remaining light.
IREBLND. (FROM oU1R O0V OOFSMOGqIDMT.) DUBLIN, WEDESDAY MORNwG. HAIWRST PROSES. Some of the country journals received this mornaIng from the southern and midland districts state that the greatest anxiety begins to prevail with regard to the safety of the potato crop. According to one of these authorities (the KilkennyJ Moderator -generally no unnecessary alarmist), there can be no doubt that the mysterious disease has partially manifested itself, but it is not yet by any means universal, and it is alleged that there is, as usual, too great a tendency to create fears in the public mnind. The Kilkenny paper publishes two reports. The first comes from the Gowran district. The writer in Ireland takes a very gloomy view of the farmers' prospects as far as the potato is concerned, while in other respects his anticipations are most cheering "So far as tho cereal crops and green crops generaJly go this year, the farmers are not likely to have cause of comn plaint. The wheat, I think, is past all danger, except that it is partially laid by the recent heavy rain; but it Is likely to prove a good average crop as to produce, while a larger breadth of land than usual has been placed under it. Bat the eotato, Ifear,is doomedforthisyear. Theolddiseaseisvisi- I leit alltheearly sown of every kind. The late sown potatoes have still a blooming, healthy appearance, but I apprehend that when they come to a certain age-that is, approach maturity, they too wiU be likely to be largely cat away. I hope I may prove a bad prophet, but the experience of past years confirms me in this opinion. If we are blessed with very fine weather it may tend considerably to stop the progress of the disease, but if wet weather set in I think we must calculate on the greater portion of the crop being destroyed. Oats, barley, ineadowing (both old and new), and turnips are doing well, and, in fact, the only drawback in I our anticipations of an abundant season is the potato, the I danger of which is a serious consideration for the farmer. There was already a field of winter-sown cats cut down last week in the neighbourhocd of Gowran, and farmers here think the harvest will be general about the 15th of August" the next report is from a Graigue correspondent He does not take quite so dark a view of the prospects of the potato crop;- " I travet each week over a wide range of this side of theI county, observing as I proceed the state of the crops. I am sorry to say that I have not observed one single garden of early potatoes the stalks of which are not extensively affected by the blight. If the mischief extended no further than the stalk, what harm? but I have, in several places, where I saw men digging out the tubers, alighted to examlne, and have invariably found the potatoes partially diseased. I have been using my own early potatoes for the last fortnight. They are the kinds called 'primroses' and 'pink-eyes.' Both kinds are as good as were ever laid on a table at this time of the year, but each is diseased to the extent, I should say, of about 1 in 20. That is not much, and if others be not worse off there wil not be so much cause to complain of. It is the samo description of potatoes which 'I see in every place affected. But I have been only speaking of the early crop. As to the general crop throughout the country, which are principally 'Scotch downs,' they look admirably, and I have no dout but that there will be an abundant crop, even allowing for a partial failure, which I am almost certain will occur. As regards the cereal crops, the prospect of quantity and quality was never more cheering. Wheat and oats, the two principal crops, are approaching maturity in many places, and, with favourable weather, I should expect to see the sickle applied to some early wheat before the 10th of August. The turnip crop bids fair to be a good one, although generally sown late this year, but the crop was not anything lke so largely grown in this as in former years, while there were more potatoes planted than in any other year since the blght first manifested itself." l?rom the adjacent county of Waterford the last accounts are much more favourable than could be expected from the tone of the advices at the close of the past week. The blight does not seem to have increased, and the crop is, upon the whole, looldng better than it did some days back. In the neighbourhood of Dublin yesterday a small field of potatoes was dug up, and a gentleman present states that at least one-half of the produce was hopelessly diseased. This, however, is an iso. lated case, for the supplies brought to the markets are abundant and of unexceptionable quality. From the western province it is stated that there were rumours relative to the early potato plantings being slightly affected with the blight, but it was believed that no injury of any moment had as yet taken'place. The tubers were not at all touched, although the stalks were blackened in enclosed and sheltered localities. THE SADLEIr ESTATEs. Yesterday, on the application of Messrs. MIorrough and Kennedy, solicitors for the London and County Bank, the Commissioners of Encumbered Estates fixed Tuesday, the 17th of November, for the sale of a portion of the estates of the late Johnt Sadleir. The rental of this division of. the property is about 4,0001. a-year. Twenty years' purchase being the average rate of the Irish landmarket, thin slice of the mysteriously acquired possessions of the suicide ought to produce at least 80,0001. out of the 260,0001. or 300,0001., the estimated gross value of all the estates which from time to time came into Sadleir's hands.

EMOlZEMENNT AN SUxCnxE.-A young rsan, who has been for several years a salesman in a respectable Glasgow warehouse, was recently suspected of having embezzled and appropriated a quantity of goods, the propertl of his employers. He had obtained leave of absence for a few days, and proceeded to Helensburgh on Friday. From circumstances which afterwards transpired a petition wa3 presented to the Sheriff, and a warrant granted for his aoprehension. Ee was taken into custody at Helensburgh 6n Saturday morning, and when the steamer was approaching Greenook he suddenly threw himself overboard. He was rescued from the water in a few minutes by some boa,men, who at once proceeded to his assistance. They hai, however, scarcely got him into the smail boat, and were kroceeding towards the west quay, when he cut his throat. When brought ashore he was conveyed to the Greenock Infirmary. The windpipe was found to be severed, and a large gash inflicted, though the principal arteries, it seems, have not been cut. He lies in a very precariousastate. The Greenock correspondernt of the .North Briislh Mail gives the following account of the matter :-" On Saturday forenoon William Wood, late salesman to William Gilmore and Co., of Glasgow, was apprehended at Helensburgh on a charge of embezzlement by Mr. Miller, messenger-at-arms, Glasow, and conveyed to Greenock in the steamer Alma. Wnile the boat was passingWest-quay Wood jumped overboard, but wasrescued i by two Norwegian seamen, who were passing. When taken into the boat, however, he drew a razor from hig pocket and out his threat. He was remitted to the infirmary, whore he lice in a critical state,"
, PORTIN6 INTLGENCE. (aOTOWOOD RAflRF I WEDNESDAY-THE STAXES DAY. The businessof the meetingcommencedto-day in earnest. The card comprised seven races, which brought out in the aggregate 83 run er Indeed, the Stewards' Cup was an " event" alone is the day's sport, and we would suggest that for the future it be brought forward, in order to strengthen the somewhat weak attractions of the Tuesday, and to enable the offioiuatogetproperlythroughthe arduous workentailed upon thom by the "Stakes"eand certain minor events for which large lields are invariable conmnanded. The only complaiut, however, can be on the score of asuperfluity of sporb -a complaint which is not uttered at many3eetingsI After thefirstrace had been disposed of Lord of the Hillswas brought out to do battle against Druxmour-an animal that ran C-emma di Vergy to a head at Chester, and who had subsequently obtained the somewhat barren honours of secand place for the Chester Cup. At first 4 to 1 was lid on him, but takers of the odds were strong in their faith and true to their principle. Lord of the Hills, who was bought for a stiffish price when ayearling, led to the distance, where Drumour caught him, and appeared to be goiug so easily that 10 to 1 was offered on him. In a few stides further he kicked, on Goater's attempting to rouse him, and swerving across the oourse was beaten easily by a length. Thirty-four started for the Stewards' Cup, and Loyola was made the favourite. He was, however, beaten early, and Tournament won a splendid raco by a head, thns proving that, notwithstanding his exhibitions at Epsom and Ascot, he still retains his two-year old form, Although the Stakes is deemed the most important event of the day, yet the race Is inferior in every respect to the encounter for the Stewards' Cup, which produces a contest unequalled for the pieturesque combination of colours, and for the striking effect produced by the competitors as they descend the hill The race for the Hunt Cup at Ascot furnishes the only parallel to that for the Stewards Cup at Goodwood. Like the race last year, the Goodwood Stakes resulted in favour of an outsider, but, unlike the race last year, it was happily marked by no accident. Leamington, the winner of the Chester Cup, won by a length; he was scarcely supported in the ring, andmanybook-makersescaped" laying." Some fortunate speculators, however, took 1,000 to 25 about him. He was ridden by Aldcroft, who has won the race now two years in succession, having landed Pretty Boy in triumph last year. The other events declded do not require comment, The onerous daties of the officials were discharged most promptly, and the races were run off with as much punctu. lity as it was possible to comnand. hr. Edward Hibburd, who officiated for his brother as starter, deserves especial praise for the tact and patience which he exercised in de. spatching large fields from the post. The muster of pleasure people was perhaps scarcely so numerous as usual, still the Grand Stand enclosure was weU filled, and the bright sunny weather gave additional ecZat to a great day's sport. The races were decided as under:- WEDNESDAY. HA.Dxc-r apPLATE of 501. Half-a-mile. Sir L. Newman's Madame Clicquot, by Burgandy, 3 yrs, 7st. 71b.

Kestrel was first off, but after going a short distance she gave wayto her stable companion, Unexpected,NewBrighton lying third, closeup, with estrel, Nougat, Theodora, Tournament, Malakhoff, and Old Times running nearly abreast, and several others, whose exacb position it was impossible to determine, in close attendance. As they descended the hiU they formed a line across the conrse, but on nearing the distance the shifting colou rs, as horse by horse disappeared from the front and fresh ones drew forward, rendered it as difficalt to te ll each chang o as it would be to guess the varying figures in a kaleidoscope. Unexpected went on with a slight lead to about half-way up the distance, where Loyola, who had been lying in the rack, seemed hopelessly beaten, and Tournament joined Unexpected and Theodora. The race in now becam e m ost exciting, and after a rou sing set-to Tournament won by ahead, Unexpected beating Theodora by a neck only for second place. About three-quarters of a length from the third was Kestrel, fourth, with Old Times, Mabel, Eying Englishman, Malakhoff, and Strawberry in a cluster at her quarters.

THEB PUBLIC SCHOOL MATCHES. TO THE EDITOB OF' THE TIMES. Sir,-.May I crave the favour of a smaU space iu your columns to-morrow, as on that day (thanks to the authorities of Winchester and Eton) ib is proposed to play Haese with the part of Haamlet left out at Tord's Cricket-ground. A match between Harrovians and Etonians under 20 years of ape is to be played to-morrow. Let us call it, in contradistinction to the real old public school matches, "the mock-turtle match." Don't let the originators of this match imagine that I am trying to throw ridicule on a very praiseworthy attempt to revivo the nearest approach to the school matches which circumstances will allow of. On the contrary, anything svhich wil bring old friends together is good for aU parties. My object in writing is to try one more word with the authorities of Winchester and Eton, and in so doing I will venture first to remind thera of the anomalous position which some of the Winchester and Eton boys viU be placed in to-morrow. No doubt several of the "Eleven" of both schools will, with the consout of their parents, be on the ground at Lord's. They must not play, however, whether their parents wish it or not, without risking their position at school on their return thither. Secondly, I will venture-speaking for many old Wykehamists-to say that our object is to co-operate with the authorities in carrying out the school matches as of yore, and to prevent the boys from being exposed to any temptation in London. We want to prevent little Flashman, who has been three months in the Ieavies, from enticing his qaondam schoolfellows to the night taverns, or Vauxhall. e want to let the son of the Rev. Mr. Needy enjoy the pleasure of the matches without taxing his father's pocket. We want to organize a plan by which the " Eleven" ahall be distributed among old Wyke. hamists ln London, who wil bont fide see that Youg HopefSl shall be kept out of harm's way. We want, above all things, to aee the matches continued at Lord's. Why, then, cannot the Warden of Winchester and Provost of Eton respectively intimate that tbey will, on the 1st of Deoenber next, roceive a deputation at Eton and Winchester of the "old boys" of each school, to see whether the matter cannot be arranged to their satlsfac~ tion. I believe the resilt would be that in half an hour the busine,s would be settled, and, liko a meeting of directors or trustees of a charity, the business would COn. clude with a good substantial luncheon, washed down with a glasa of the old College ale, of blessed memory I I will only say, in conclusion, to the heads of depart-. ments that we, the old boys, are discontented and dissatisfied. One of tho main links in our bond of fellowship is brokon, and can only be mended by restoring the matches. The cricketing world, moreover, ask the disagreeable questionb vhat have the Winchester and Eton boys done? Harrow, Rugby, and Marlborough can come to Lord's; why not Winchester and Eton 7 Sir, comparisons are very odions, Yours obedientlv. A IVYKEHAIIT. o11iy .

M JfONEY-MARKETandCOITYINTELUq.BNCE, Wednesday Erenbg. The Indian news was received by the public this morning universally sa a great relief, but it failed to produce any deoided rebound in the StockExchange. Consols for money, which left off last evening at 90,, were first quoted 90i to 91*, and they ranged between these points throughout the day. At the close there were sellers at 91 for money, while for the account the price was 91 to i. Among the mercantile community the effect which the destruction of the Chinese fleet is likely to have in shortening the war with that country was much dwelt upon. In some quarters, also, there was a strong disposition to believe that the report fronz Madras of Delhi having been taken will prove not to have been unfounded. The supposition is that as the intelligence from Delhi viU Bombay reacne3 only to the 17th of June, although the mail did not leave Bombay till the Ist of July, the telegraphic and other communication by that route must have been broken, but that it still remained open by Madras. The messages received at the India-house to-day merely confirmed the fact of two sorties of the insurgents having been repulsed by General Barnard, and of the disarmning of the troops at Calcutta having been effected without difficulty. One circumstatce that operated this morning in prevent. ing any return of buoyancy in the Stock-Exchange consisted in the prospect of increased shipments of silver, owing to the quotations received from Bengal. There was also a very active demand for loans on Government securities at 56 per cent., and later in the afternoon it was known that the drain of bullion from the Banik which hag set in during the last few days steadily continues,. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 216; Reduced, 9l to i; Newr Threo per Cents., 91i to ; India Stock, 214 to 216; India Bonds, 23s. to 18s. discount; and Exchequer-bills, os. to Is. discount. The inquiry now is, when may the next India mail be expected? Judging from last year, the day for the receipt of the telegraph will be Wednesday week, the 12th of August. It is not improbable, however, that, supposing anything of great import. ance to have occurred shortly after the despatchl of the present mail, the authorities in India will have made an effort to transmit the intelligence by mean8 of the steamer from Australia en 'route to Suer. This vessel-the European-would be due at Point de Galle on the 11th of July (assuming her to have left Sydney on the 15th of June, as advertised), and Aden on the 22d of July; so that, in the event of a steamer being despatched from Bombay to the latter place, news to about the 8th or 9th of July, or a week later than that just brought, might be received here, vid Marseilles, about the 5th of August. The market for foreign securities continues dull, but prices show considerable firmness. NWo specnllative transactions have taken place to-day, except in Turki-sh, which closed at a recovery from the late decline. Peruvian Four-and.a-Ualf per Cents. were negotiated at 81i; ditto Three per Cen's. 55*; Mexican, 22i and i; Sardinian, 89, 89k, and .; Spanish, 40; ditto New Deferred, 25; Turkish Six per Cents., 944, and i, and for the account, 941 95; and Datet Four per Cent. Certiicates, 98. The corn-mar'et this morningwas without alteration. The closing prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f.70c. for money and 66f. 80c. for the account, showing a recovery of more than an eighth. About 47,0001. in bar gold was taken from th3 Bank to-day for exportation. The Columbia from New York has brought 20,0001. Telegraphic announcements wern received this morning of the suspension of M. Giustinani at Constantinople. The quotations of the Indian and Chinese exchanges to-day are all more unfavourable, and the shipments of silver by the overland mail of the 4th are therefore expected to be increased to 900,0OOO. At Bombay, Hongkong, and Shanghai the rise is only slight, but at Calcatta it is equal to between I and 2 per cent. In consequence of this movement the India Company have notified an advance to-day of lper cent, in their rate for drawing bills. On Calcutta and Iadras it will be 2s. Okd. and on Bombay 2s. ld. The bar silver brought by the last West Indi% steamer has been sold at 61JdL, showing an advance of id. on the price realized by the preceding steamer, although in the interim sales have been effected at; this and evenl, in some instances, ata higher rate. The telegraphic advices from China mention that the exports of teato date were60,o500,0001b., and of silk 73,000 bales to Great Britain and 13,500 to France and elsewhere. The new crop of Nankia silk was reported to be fine and abundant, but prices were very high. At Foochow the supplies of tea were small, and quotations were advancing. The destruction of the Chinese fleet is stated to have taken place off " Fatshan," but the carelessness o£ the telegraph with regard to names, figures, and dates is habitually so gross that it is always dii3icult to conjecture wbat is meant. An analysis of the trade of the united kingdom for the first half of the present year indicates that, whatever may have been the profits of business, they have been diffused among the masses rather than among the limited body of employers, since they. have led to an unprecedented importation of articles of food and luxury. During the corresponding half of 1856 the quantities taken were enormous, but a great additional stride has since been made. As compared with that period the arrivals show an increase of about 16 per cent. in butter, cheese, and salted provisions, 80 per cent. in animals, 6i per cent, in sugar, 27 per cent. in cocoa, 32 per cent, in tobacco, 41 per cent. In wine, Si per cent, in spirits, and about 300 per cent, in currants and raisins. W"heat and flour, it is true, show a decrease, but only of 5 per cent. in the former, and 33 per centin the latter; while of barley, oats, &c., the receipts have more than doubled. Coffee and tea show a decrease respectively of 27 and 16 per cent., but this as regards the latter is due to other causes than a diminished demand. As respects other articles than those of food it is difficult to form an estimate, because these are required for the wspply of our export manufacturers. There is little reason to doubt, however, that the consumption of clothing and of evervthing else used for domestic purposes has been equally rapid and general. Thus all the materials for dress present an extraordinary augmentation. In gloves it is 25 per cent.; in boots, 27 per cent.; in hides, 33 per cent.; in 'wool, 25 per cent.; in raw silk, 80 per cent.; in flax, 60 per cent.; in indigo, 36 per cent.; and in cochineal, 53 per cent. In oils, with the exception of olive, which exhibits a decrease of 46 per cent., there has been an average increase of 25 per cent. In tallow it is 13 per cent.; in metals, with the exception of tin and spelter, it ranges from 1o to 45 pe^r cent., and in timber it is 21 per cent. Meanwhile, prices of almost all descriptions of produce have experienced a rapid rise, and the calculation as to the extent of our purchases would therefore be very inperfect if it were based merely on the addition in quantities. The explanation of this state of affairs must still consist in the increased demand for labour and the higher wages universally consequent on the Californian and Australian gold discoveries, and it is also certain that while the labour available is to some extent of an inferior quality, owing to the departure of many ot the best hands, the class by whom it is performed are new to their prosperity and little accustomred to economy and self-restraint. UInder these circumstanices it is not surprising, that our bullion leaves us as fast as it comes. Vhile the possessers of fixed incomes have suffered year by year from the steady advance in the cost of living and the pressiue of the incometax, the multitulde have escaped that tax, and have at the same time enjoyed constantly increasing ease. According to the accounts from the United States and Canada it may be greatly doubted whether manual labour in those countries obtains a return equal to that nowattainable on thisside,andwiththe harvest that is promised for the present year there is good ground to believe that the limit of this condfiZon haa not yet been reached. At a meeting of the UJnited exican Mining VCompany to-day, Sir John EBasthope in the chair, a trepoe from Mavor Farrell was read and adopted 1uuliniousl. It xeQapitu1ated the iudoremtioa
BAILWAY INTELLIGENCE. NORTH STAFFORDSHIRE. ane nal-yearly meeting ot this company was held on Tuesday at Stoke-upon-Trent, Mr. J. L. Ricardo, XL.P., in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared In 17ie Times, was taken as read. The CuAM r, in moving the adoption of the rert congratulated the shareholders on the great increase which had taken place in their local traffic. The direct through traffic for the half-year ending June showed a decrease of 1,000 tons as compared with the preceding half-year. Although there was a continued increase of local and local through traffic on the line, he was sorry to say that the direct throughtraffic was impeded in every possible way by the Londonand North-WesternCompany,who had prevaileduponthe Cannock Mineral Railway Company to abandon an agree. mcnt entered into with the North-Staffordshire Company, by which the latter would have obtained an outlet to Wolverhampton. By the provisional agreement with the Cannock .Mineral Company the North lvtaffordshire had agreed to guarantee them 4t per cent. on 110,0(01., on condition of that company coming to Colwicb, instead of Rugeley. It was also agreed that the Cannock Company were to a pply to Parliament for an extension of their line to WoEver. hampton, the North Staffordshire Company agreeing to guarantee 4 per cent. on the cost of that portion of the nudrtalkng. The Cannock Company, however, thought at to repudiate that agreement, in consequence of a guarantee of 5 per cent. on the 110,0001. by the London and North-Western Company. He did not know whatview the shareholders of the latter company would take of that arrangement, but it was quite clear to him that about 5,0001. a-year would be sacrificed for the purpose of obstructin the operations of the North Staffordshire Company. The land had been purchased for the Biddulph branch, and he hoped the works would be commenced in the coureo of a few months, He had no doubt that when the branch was completed it would not only be of value to the district through which it would pass, but also to the shareholders. The local traffic of the district had increased considerably since the construction of the railway, and it had no doubt conferred corresponding advantages on the inhabitants. The number of tons of all sorts of manufactures and minerals conveed in the district in 1846 was 1,339 965 and in 1856 the number had Increased- to 2,670,kO, 4ons. The nottere' materials carried in 1848 amounted to 58,000 tons, and in 1846 they amounted to 109,000 tons. The weight of manufactured goods carried in the year 1848 was 46,000 tons, and in the year 1856 it amounted to about 96,000 tons, showing an increase of 108 per cent, in the co,urse of eight years. He hoped the time was not distant -when they would have an independent through route of their own to enable them to develope the resources of their undertaking. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BRODIICK seconded the motion for the adoption of the report. After some observations with regard to the traffio resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividend atthe rate of 4 per cent, per annum, and re-eleoting the rethirg directors and auditor. The proceedings conoluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors. - PEEBLES. A meeting of this company was held on Tuesday at Peebles, to determine as to theraising of 27,0001. bythe creation and issue of new shares; Mr. A. Nichol in the chair. The CHArnAN stated that when the Peebles line of railway was first opened only a very small capital was required, It being understood that the North British Railway Company were to work it. Almost from the first, however, the vhole burden of working the line bad been thrown on the directors of the company; and, though they hadnodoubtthat this was the most advantageous position forthe railway, It brought with it the necessity for a very large increase of capitaL The capital required had been lent to the company by the banks at the rate of 6j per cent. per annum. The difference between the 64 per cent. paid upon the borrowed money and the 5 per cent. which the directors proposed to pay upon the new preCerence shares would amount toa saving of about 4001. per annum. The new shares would be issued to the holders of ordinary shares at the rate of one for every three at present held by them. Ho then moved that the sum of 27,0001. be raised by the creation and issue of 2,700 niew 101. shares, with a preferentisl dividend of 6L per cent. After a short discussion the resolution was unanimously adopted, and the meeting separated. COMLPETITION FOR LONDON AND MANCHESTER TRAFFIC. The opening of a new route to Manchester, consequent upon the working alliance just concluded between the Great Northern and the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Companies, seems likely to have an effect on the travelling facilities between the above places. Already the ondon and North-Western Company have arranged to put en two extra express trains daily, without any important acceleration of speed, except that given by an avoidance of all unnecessary stopages. By this means the time of transit between London and Manchester wiU be brought down to a uniform average of 4i hours for the 1w6 mneiles There wilU now be four express trains, each cr,ying first and second olass passengers, leavng Eust'4!.squsre for Manchester daily-viz. at 9a.m., 2.15 p.m., qp.m., and 5.15 p.m., and, with the exception of the lmt, 'ehich conveys the Irish afternoon mail vid Holyhead, all i, direct communication with Liverpool, Huddersfield, and Xther important manufaoturing towns. The Great Nortlbrn Company have also laid on special service trains, reduaing the time occupied by the journey to a minimum of 5 '46urs and 20 minutes.

RAILWAY AND MINING ARES. Wednesday Evenng. In the railway-market to-day a reaction took place from the late fall, and the heavier stocks were quaoted i. to 10,. higher. An advance of 11i occurrcd in some descriptions of leased lines and preference sbares. East Indian and Canadian improved; Scinde Railway were rather flatter. In French shares there was a recovery from the decline of yesterday. Colonial Government securitie3 were in good demand, the transactions in them being rather numerous at firm prices.

LrnAio Asxium iN IRELAND.-The eighth report on the district criminal and private lunatio asylums in Ireland has just been published in the form of a blue-book of some dimensions. It appears that on the 31st of Decem. ber lazt there were at large in Ireland 1,179 lunatics, 4,262 idiots, and 2,171 epUeptics, maldbg a grand total of 7,612 at large, of whom 4,2n were males and 3,390 females-1,470 Protestants, 5,782 Papists, 358 Presbyterians, and2 Quakers. The total rumber of lunatics and idiots inunion workhouses at the same date was 1,729, of whom nearly all (1,503) were Papists. In addition to the 7,612 lunatics, &c., at large there were 6,520 insaue patients located in public and rIvate asglums, rnaklng a total of 14,141 against 3,43 in te preceding year. The total expenditure of district lunatic asylums sn the year ended 31st of March last was 77,4321. against 72,6901. In the preceding year. No peculiar medical treatment for the cure of insanity is resorted to in the Irish asylums, except in its early stages, or when marked symptoms of the disease appear in more advanced stages; air, exercise, regimen, and the removal of exciting causes are mainly relied on. The wise and merciful system of non-restraint is generally pursued and with success. Education appears to be in a much higher ratio amcsg luntics than in the community at large-a circum. stance Indicativo of the fact that insanity, even among the lower orders, is connected with intellectual development.

LAW REPOBT. COURT OF CHANCKRY. rcor-os.Nw Jm.v -0 1W;ELIARS V. PAGE. (Before the LoD CRAiCELMLOR- *ma was a motion on behalf of the plaintiffs to vacatO the enrolment of an order made by the Master of the Bolls dismissing the biM as against the defendant Dabbs for want of prosecntion, and also to discharge the order itself. The suit was instituted in the year 1853 against 30 or 40 de. fendants, for the purpose of winding up the affairs of an abortiveraliway company. Various alterations tookplace in the parties by death, change of interest, &c., and eventually the cause was set down for hearing in the mon'th of August, 1855, but no subpcena to rejoin was served. On the 8th of May, 1857, Dabbs moved to have the bil dismissed for want of prosecution, and obtained an order from the Master of the Rolls to that effect. Some difficulty waz made by the plaintiffs in the Master's office, and subsequenti an aplcation was made to the Court to discharge the order, *whch was dismissed vith costs. On the 15th of June Dubs senrolled the order, dismising the bil as against himEelf. On the 2d of July the plaintiffs gave notice of appeal before the LordsJustices, but uponasceran. ing that the order had been enrolled in the^ meantime they withdrew that notice, and substitnted the present motion before the Lord Chancellor. Mr. Jessell and Mr. HI. Smith appeared for the motion; Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Hardy opposed it for labbs. The LORD CHANcErLoR said he cculd see nothing in the proceedings of Dabbs which could be made the subject of i3nerolingt.h e order Sbut tlhePre had been nPo surprise or3mfair dealing towvards the plaintiffs. EIe had as much right t.o enrol an interlocutory order as a final decree, and therefore the motion must be refused, with cotsta ELLIOTT v. INCE. It will be recollected that leave was given by the Lord Chanellor some time back to try several issues at law to ascertain whether Mrs. Cumming was of unsound mind at the tine she executed certain deeds. The questions relatingto Mr. Cnmming and her property have been for years before these Courts, and obtained considerable notoriety. Mrs. Cumcming had been found by inquisition a lunatic from the Ist of May, 1846, but almost the last thiug she did previous to her death was to obtain from this Court leave to traverse such finding of the jury. That permisdon was of course never prosecuted, and in April last the plantiff, who is a creditor of 1M Cumming, obtained leave to try the isses in question. The object of the present motion, made on behalf of the defendant, was that thefouer several suestions of fact directed to be decided by a jury might be taken pro confemso against the plantiffs .and that the sid several questions m3ight be taen as tried, and a verdict had thereon for the defendant. The ground for the application was the laches of the plaintiff innot trying the issue before. lfr Cairns was for the motion; Mr. Bacon and M. W. Morris co,crd. The IOllD CABeCELLon made an order directing the issues to be tried peremptorily at the sittings after next term, and the plaintiff to pay the costs of this application. (Before the LoRnn JUSTICES of APPxAx-) EX PARTR GRAY, T RE THE NXWCASTL UPONTYNE MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY. This case, which has been many times before the Co3rt, was gai placed on the paper this morning, for Mr. Boundel Palmer to appear for the defendant, the officiai manager of the company. The point in dispute arose in tre chambers of the Master of the Rolls, upon a claim by Mr. Grayt a merchant, of NewcasUe, against the company, on four Dills of exchange, of which Mr. Gray was the acceptor, and the whole question was whether he had accepted the bills for the accommodation of the company, or for the rivate accommodation of Mir. Brockett, the manaIng uirector. Twice this point was heard before the Chef Clerk of the Master of the RolLs, who each time decided that the company were the zeal debtors. Upon the suggestion that Mr. Gray ought to be cross-examined the same took place, and the same conclusion was come to. The Master of the Rolls decided also in favour of Mr. Gray, but, upon appeal to this Court, the Lords Justices, with. out hearing the whole evidence, or caUing upnn Mr. Gray's counsel, sent the case to betried at law. The action was trled in June before Lord Campbell, when a verdict was found in favour of Mr. Gray. Some irregularity appearedto have been comxnitted as to the preparation of the postea, the verdict having been so far against Mr. Gray aS that it did not comprise a sum of 451. which it should have done, and having been, as the company alleged, too extensive as allowing mnterest on the whole demand. Mr. Gras waived his right as to the 45R, but the company insisted that tho interest should not be allowed, and intimated an intention to apply to the Court of Queen's Bench to reduce the damages so far as the interest was concerned. M1r. LEE (with Mr. F. S. Williams) insisted that, inas. much as Mr. Gray was, underthe 120th statute of the Common Law Proceadure Act, 15th and 16th of Victoria, cap. 76, in a condition to issue execution on the judgment the COmpaDy having allowed 14 days to expire without taking proceedings, he was entitled to Payment. Mffr. R1TDELL PALMER read a subsequent clause of the Act to show that the common law court had authority to correct the mistake, even aithoogh execution bad act;ually After a lengthened and somewhat angry discussion, it was arranged that the debt of 6S71. os. 7d. and the taxed costs should. he paid to Mlr. Gray, but that the amount of the In-a terest, the r,fight to which WaIS in dispute, should be paid into oourt; Thne costa of the dispute have already amounted THEl GOVRNORS OF THE GRAY COAT HOSPITAL IN TOTHML PIEDS OF THE ROYAL FOUNDATION OF QUER ANEN V. THE WESEMINSTER 11PROVE3ENT COOMaSIONEnS AND OTHERS. This case raised a most important question to convey. sncers as to judment debta. The Hospital contracted to sell land totae uommissonerm. Part only of the Vurchase noney was paid, and the Commissioners were let into possession, but no conveyance was executed. The Commissioners becoming insolvent were unable topay the remainder of the n ronAr. and the governors of the hospital filed a bil againt them for specac performance and for payment of the remainder of the money, or in default that the governors might be declared to have a lien for the money, and that the landmight be sold to pay it. A decree was made In accordance, and it appeared that before the date of the decree judgments had been registered against the Commissioners, and a purchaser of one lot required that the judgment creditors should either enter up satisfaction or release their interests. Vice-Chancellor Stuart held that this requiition was untenable, and ordered the purchaser to pay money Into court, who now appealed. Mr. W. COOPER supported the appeal, relying upon the 13th section of the statute 1st and 2d Victoria, c. 110, as making such judgments direct charges on the interest of the Comnnssioners in the land, and argued that the judgment creditors had a right to redeem, and might hereafter, if not now got rid of, put the present purchaser to very great expense and trouble after he had erected houses on the ground. He cited Lord St. Leonard's book on Vendors and Purchlers, last edition, pages 88 and 89, and cases before his Lordship when in Ireland. Mr. BAcoN and Mr. G. W. CoLnNs, for the vendors, submitted that, as their lien was prior to the charge of the judgment creditors, the course required was not necessarybut if inusted on and acquiesced in by the Court it would be impossible under this or mny other similar decree of the Court to execute the intention, and more especially so in this case, as the_purchasers were both large and numerous. Lord Justice KNIGHT BtruE saw no difference between the case of a mortgagee of the Commissioners' (the original purchaser's) interest if they had mortgaged it and asjudgrent creditor of such purchaser. To say the least, his Lordship doubted whether the objection were not a valid one, but he might perhaps say he something more than doubted, This being the case of a purchaser entitled to an undoubted title and conveyance, a doubt even as to a conveyance (if it were only a question oficonveyance and not a question of title) was sufficient. Perhaps it would be better for the vendors to discharge the purchaser from his contract. Lord Justice Tunm conounred, observing that he had no doubt as to the rights of the judgment creditors, Mr. W. COOPER said that, under the circumstances, the purchaser was wlling to be discharged, and therefore would take an order for his discharge in the ordinary form. MICKLMTWAIT V. MICKLETEWAIT. Mr. G. M. G Any D concluded the argument for the defendant. Mr. LEwnr was heard in reply. Their LoRDSIaPs ordered the case to stand in the paper of Tuesday next for judgment. THE HXABRDASBRS' COlPANY V. ISAAC.

NESI PrS COURT.-(BCfOre Lord CAMMEnL) DRYSDAT.E V. 2STO Mr. Serjeant Wells and Mr. Xeaue-were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Prendergast and Mr. Evans were counsel for the defendant. This was an action of crin. cox., 'with a count for de. priving the plaintiff of the society of bis wife. The defenant ptleaded "Not guilty" to the frst and "Leave and liceSI to the second count. The plantiff is one of the crew of the floating lightship In Yarnouth Roads. and the defendant, who is a widower, aged 60, is a coalhesver, in Yarmouth, where he has some little house property. The duties of the plaintiff require his presence on board the lightship during two months in every qusrter. The defendant has two sons, one of whom is married to the sister of the plaintiff's wife, and the evidence on which the case of the plaintiff restedwasthatof his two aOnS, and the wife of the one. From their testimony it appeared that the intimacy of the defendant with Xras Drysdale being supected the guilty pa3r were watched on two occasions during the absence of the plaintiff, on both of which the defendant and Mrs. Drysdale were observed in positions and under circun. stances which could lead but to onio conclusion. On one of these occasions the defendant's xon and wife suddenly broke in h upon. the defendant and Mm. Dxys dale, when th former said "1Well, youi scoundrel, you have found us out at Iastk and that's just what we wanted, was it not, Matilda?' When the scandal was noised abroad it appeared that the plaintiff on his return home told his wife to goaa,and that she thereupon took up her abode with the aefendant. he 3r eventually returned a verdict for the plaintiff, vlth one fartng damages. (Before a Speci.C Jury.) LZG A. V. CEE EAST DFMnA COBNEXCH"AXoz COMPANY. Mr. Couch, Mr. Bulwer, and Mx. Drake were counsel for the Crown ; Mr. Prendergast Mr. Evans, and Mr. Dasent were counsel for the defendants. This was an indictment for obstructing a highway and a market by the erection of a cormn-echange in the town of Eas Dereham. The case occied a considerable porton of the day, there being a large boy of witnesses called for the prosection to show a general and long-standing use of the spot in question by the public and mnarket peple, which was anwred by proof of the erection of theatres and wld beast shows at other times than fairs, which were put up under the sanction of the Crown, as Lords of the manor, or its lessees, and occu. pied the space in dispute for days and weeks, to the exclusion of the public. As to the alleged obstruction of thermarket, it was shown the locus inuo was hardly ever used as a market, and tht when the gown conveyed the soilto the defendants therewas an exprems agreement, which was carried out, that the company should purchasetwo small houses which stood on the undoubtedmarket-plac and, convey the site to the Crown, in order that it might be dedicatedl to the pubIic in ecicange for the site granted to the defendants, and that they sr ould form a clear 20 feet street by the side of their exchange. At the conolusion of the case for the defendant, Lord CAMSBXLL told the jury that, though the sell of the spot in question was in the Crown, as lord of the manor, it could not dispose of the rights of the public if any had been acquired over itby long-continued user. There was abundant and strong evidence from which the jury might and ought to infer that the whole of the spt now occupied by the Corn-Exchange was, in fact, a publo highway, and unless that wras rebuttecl by interruption, and the -exercise of rights of ownershie? over it by the Crown or its leoss, which were inconsutant with that inferene, the prosecutors would be entitled to a verdict on those counts charging the obstruction of a highway. As to the counts charging the obstruction of markets on the same spot the evidence was not so strong, but there was evidence of markets having been held there. At the same time, It was undoubted aw that the Crown, as lord of the manor, might substitute a new market for an old one if it was reasonably commodious. Ifthe juryshould id that there was no market held on this ground, or that the change was reasonably sufdoient, then they might find for the defendants as to the second class of counts.

',TORTHIBRT cnaurp. FEWCASTIE -JULY 28. Ibhis morning 'Idr. Baron WATSOlT sat at the Moot-hall l for fae trial of the remainder of'tho prisoners. RichaidJohnston, aged 17, was indicted for stealing a Ipost letter coztaining money, 'the property of the Postzaaster-GenerZl, at Berwicksmpou-Tweed, on tho 27th of * .Aril last. )r. Overcdd, Q.C., and M3.n Seymour prosectted, and the -Hon. A. Liddell defended the-prisoner. It appeareil tbat a gentlemnan named Gregeow, who resided .at Low Lynn, near Berwrick, was in the habit of sending lids letters to the Post-office at SBerwick by a prirate bag, which was Ieft 'at his lodge to be-called for by the rnail rider w ho - arried The letters frolm Lowvick to Berwick. Of this I bag the postmaster haid a key, and the other akey was kept at the looge. On the 27th of April *last Mr.' Gregson had occasion to send a remittance 'to hris' baiikers at Bervnd:;, and wrote a letter addressed to Mr. Logan at the Ds~trict Bsnk, Berwick, enclosing in it a 'check for BOA., '25.R in notes, twro eovereigns, and 17s, 6d. in money, sand 6S. 6d. in postage stamps. Toian. Eure the safe deliverYg of this letter he w,rote a letter~to-tho icostmaster at Berwidik, telling him that this was a; money *letter, and requesting that he would see it safely delivered. 'These letters verer put into Mfr. Gregson'e private hag, and it was locked as-usual and left at his lodge to be eaed for by the mail rider. T?he prisoner was the mail rider engaged to carry the letters from Lowick to Be; -sick at B2. a-year wrages, andthe privato bag w,as given to himu that dayto carry *as usu'sL 'The bag wvas delivered at the post-office locked as usual, hut no money letter was in it, nor ancy-letter 'to the postmaster. MIr. Gregson, not havlng any solkuovledgment of his remittance for five days, wrotc to -snake inqu£rie8, and this led to the prisoner tbeing taken into custody. Itt asw found thM a letter could be got out of *the locked bag without opening it; and it was also 'astertained that the prisoner, who two dslys before the 27th had *been borrowring lOs. to ~get out of a difficulty, was three or four days after that baying a silver wateh, for wrhich he.gave 51S., and had also changed a Si. note, and had sold Zs. or 4s. worth of stamps. These facts having been proved, Mfr. IiifDELL submitted that the letter lost was net af post letter wvithin the meaning of the statute, but was a mere private parcel directed to the postmaster, viith a request that he would deliver it for him, and which the postmaster mi2ht ' wave'done, had it arrived, without its going* through the post at all, and until the parcel reached the post-office itwas merely in the private bag of Mr. Gregson. His LORDSIIIP was clearly of opinion that this was a ;post letter. There could be no question that had it been delivered to the mail rider it would have been sO .; it was *not less so because it wvas delivered to him in a -hag. Mfr. LiIDDELL said he had watched the case for hsa client, and would leave it in his Lordship's hands. His LORDS}HIP having summed up, The jury found the prisoner Guilty. His LORDSI31P in passing sentence said, it was of the greatest importance that the correpondence of the country should be protected from. theft, and. he should therefore impose a heavy sentence on -the prisoner as a warning to all -that such effences as these wrould-snot be lightly dealt with. The sentence of tho Court was that ho he senttoseven years' penal servitude. The criminal bni.iness was disposed of about 1 'clock, and his Lordship then tried common jury causes. SUTER AND ANOTHER V. SIURRELL. This was an action against the sheriff of Northumberland for negligence in not having arrested a man named Parro on mesne process, when it was in his power to do so. MIr. Edward James, Q C., and Mtr. Erett appeared for the plainti.ff, and htr. Manisty, Q.C., and the Hen. A. LiddeUl sor the defendant. It appeared that the captain of a Prussian vessel, the *Emma Krey, named Parro, became indebtea to the plaintiffs in a sum of 86f1. for repairs done to his vessel, and was about leaving this country in September last, when on affidavit of that fact and of the debt befhre a judge a writ was issned to arrest him on insane process, andecompel him to give security to answer an action for the debt. The warrant to arrest him was handed to a bailiff of the sheriff of Northumberland named Cook, who took with him an assistant named HalL. Cook found Parro on board - lis ship in the Tyne at North Shields, which is within the jurisdiction of the sheriff of Newcastle, and went to the ship's Eide in a boat, and by some means induced Parro to come ashore. Parro got ashore first by his own beat and made for the house of a ship's chandler named Seeman, where Cook and his man followed him. There Cook in a room of the house said he had come to arrest Parro, and on 'Seeman asking him his authority hce produced his wvarrant and-read it, and Seeinan explained it in German to Parro. There were at the same time in the room-two or'three Swedisb captains, and they, hearing what was going on, said in German there shouald be bloodshed-before-Parrowas4rrested. *Seeman, hearing this, said he would have no disturbance in his house, and ordered them all out. Parro immediately arose, and w/ent out of the door " like an eel," Cook shout. * lg after him "-You are my prisoner." According to the plaintiff's statement Cook ought and might then have arrested the man, but he did nothing but stand and shout after him. According to the defendant's evidence Cook did his best to arrest Parro, but MIrs. Seeman steed in his way and obstructed him, and Parro was out of the door in an instant. Parro then ran down to the landing stage, followed by Cock. Parro jumped into his boat, which was fastened by the painter, and Cook got hold of~ the painter, and began paUling at the boat "as he would tug at a cod*fish," crying out " You are my prisoner." Parro's men then cut the painter, and shoved the beat off, Parro crying out he was not quite his prisoner yet. Parro then got on hoard and his vessel got away to *sea, and the present action was brought to recover from the sheritffthe am'-uomt of the writ in the action, on the ground that the hailiff ought to have arrested the man. The Jury retired, sod after a long absence found a verdict for the plaintiff for the amlount claimed. MIr. -Ba:ron Cu A.NNELL has been engaged all day trying a pedigyree c.ause-another trial of the same-cause ordered by *the Court of Chancery-which is net likely to conclude unatil -late to-morrow.
MIDLAND CrIRTWT DERBY, JULY1 27. --, sgr jur. Justice 1RE6SWELL and a Common Jury.) IANUD V RADFORD. Mr. Bell and Mr. Simmonds were counsel -for the plaintiff, an Mr. O'BrLen for the defendant. This was an action for a breach of promise of marriage. The plaintiff and defendant.were in humble circumstances, and their acquaintance began when they were fellow-servants in the service.of.a Mrs. Beeaton, of Ilkeston. The defendant, however, had latterlj come into the pe6session f -somne property, and wasnow the owner7of land worth about 8001. It appeared very clearly from the evidence of the plaintiff's sister that the defendannt hba proposed at one timue to marry the plaintifi, and that with reference to that event a conversation took place in ihe plaintiff's family respecting his .means, and that at that time he said he had 3001. in ready money. A few -of his letters were read, but they were certainly net of a very ardent character. The principal one, signed by him as a lover, was taken tip in a great measure with the interesting infor mation that he was sufferiz1g froni boils in the face , but it did contain an cilusion to the time coming when their in-terwmirse should he complet-ely unreserved and he should tell lier all. Tow,nYds thueird of 1855 he, however, was *.aiihless enough to marry another woman ; and in one letter abi thtbattiAe,heenprossedAJery deep contrition for the xmanner in which he had treated the plaintiff. The action was commenced above a year ago, and it was now brought ,on for trial, iii cdn"Frence of the defendant having comyelled the plaintiff to pcwceed. a Mr. O'BsuEx addreis(. the jury for the defence, and ex-pressed a hope that they evould bear-in mind that the de- fend4kt's condition in life was thkt of a mere labouring man, and that, though he had come into the possession of a rnall property, they woud& not give any such serious ,amount damages as would affect hix future prespests in life. It was clear from the ddlay whiwh had taken place that the plaintiff herself was zeot -very anxious about the mnatter; and perhaps psbe thought tbat,tbe defendant him"eIf h2d takeii a sensible view of the snIiacct, when in one of his letters he bad said that it was not for their muttual liappinae.s. thatgb ghpuIld inarry a man soscor as he was, and so much older than herself. bThe leared JluDGrsuanened np, and obserwed that the obJectitOn on the ere of difference of ago was one which ,8h?ul h.avo comue frorn the p laintiff to be of any ~Weight.

No -qe,uestion'of testamuentary capacity was raised u2pon this issue. ; he simple point was whether the will of the teetator and ,twlo.codlloils were properlv attested. The dun execution Of the swill was proved by Mr. Tomlinson, a solicitor in Ash'be2rn, at whose office it wras executed, though it was pre! pared by the testator himnself, and by his son, one of the atabtifng witnesses. The other attesting witness, a man 'named Mitehell, upon being exsanined on the subject, denied that ho had seen the testator sign his name, ad he pretended that he did not know whether the signatures of the tettor ann of Tomlinson were on the paper wvhen he put his namie there, although the will consisted of five separate sheets, each of which was signed by the testator and the two witnesses. The will bore date in AprI, 1852, and the two codicils in Mharch and A pril, 1854. Both codicils were attested by two persons named Hnrd, and Ifis.' Hawrkesworth p roved that the cwodiols were duly execnted by the testator in their Presence; but upon James Hurd being called and examineda s a witness, he, like Mitchell, denied that the testetor had either signed or acknowledged his signature in his presence. Both Mitchell and Hurd had, however, in the Court of Chancery, orbetfore the surrogate, when the will was proved, swrorn to the doe execution of the iustruments. The learned JVDGZ said that all testamentary dispositlons of property w/ould be in jeopardy if the jury were to prononcoe themi invalid simply because an attesting witness chose to come forward and deny thatb'he had seen that which, by the form of attestation' which he had signed, he had rpceted himself to have seen. Independently of the evidlenco of Mlitchell and Hurd, there was abundant evidence of due execution, and, considering that on£former occasions they had both sworn to the due execution, their present denial was not of muchh weight. The jury at once' returned a verdict amxlminiZ the duo execution of the will and codlcils. JVL.Y 29. (Before Mf^,. Justice CBESSWELL andi a Spcciai Jury.) HIGEKORE, CLERE, V. THEI EASiL ND COUNTCESS OF' . }ARRINOTON. This was an action of slander for 'words spoken by the Countess of Harrington, imputing misconduct to the plaintiff, the Vicar of Elvaston. 3fr. Macaulay, Q.C., and Mr. Field, wore counsel for the plaintiff;' Mr. Mellor, Q.C., and MEr. Bell for the defendants. Mr. MIACAULAY, in his, opening address, stated that the plaintiff had with great reluctance been compelled to come into court for the vindication of his character from the very serious aspersions 'which had beer. most industriously cast upon it by Lady Harrington, *nd' he hoped that the jury would give him such an amount pf damages as would Esatisfy every one of their oplnion of the utter groundlessness of the charges which had been made. The foljpwing witnesses wrer e*amliied: The flv. Thomas James Jones.-I have been curate of Elvasten since the 1st of January last, On Sunuday, the 2d of February, I. went to -the Castle to lunch. I sawF the Countess of! E-r,ington in the* drawing-room. After the ordinary complimnents of tho day Lad HI&rrington asked me who was likely to administer the: sacrament next Sunday. I answered, I did not know, but would ascertain and let her know during the week. Lady Harrington said, " We never take the sacrament from that man Highmore, because he is so wicked a man. 'Whenever I tske the sacrament I go to Alvaston or have it administered to me at Gawswvorth. I never take the sacrament here because of that man Highmore." She then went on to say, " He keeps the sacrament money and never gives any to the poor, and pocketed the money the Duke of ,einter gave for the repairing of the church." Her Ladyship also added, "HEe dis so low and vulgar a fellow, and such a drunken character, that Lord Harrington cannot receSve him. He is always playing at cards and gambling, and encourages the people in thevillage in all kindsof' gambhing, c&rd-playing, and debauchery, and he and his wife are constantly roiling drank on the Sloor." She concluded thishlttleoharangue by6saying "1 should consider it sacrilege to take the sacrament from so wicked and bad a man." Afterwards I asked MIr. Highmore whether he would be able to administer the sacrament on Sunday, and he said he hoped to do so himself. Alter the service at church on Ash-WednesdaFy Lady Harrington sent for me and asked who w as likely to admainister the sacrment on Sunday. I said I did not know, but would ascertain. On the following Thursday morning I again asked Mr. Highmore, and he said he wvas so much better that he hoped to be able to administer it himself. I went to Lady Hlarriugton and told her. " I said I trust you will not stay away because you may think a m&n wicked," and I added some observations on the ministrations of the wicked, which I took chiedly from the Articles. Hler Ladyship argued the question qunietly with me, and added " No, it won't do;* I should consider it sa crilege ;" and added, " He is always telling lies, and never speaks the truth." Several statements of this kind had been made. I made inquiries, and on the eve of A6h-Wednesday I inquired of himself as to the disposal of the sacrament money. On Easter Sunday I had an invitation to lunch at the Castle. I found the private gate from the church to the Castle looked. Iin consequence lunched with SIr. Eiighmore. After service, in consequence of a message, I went to Lady Hsrrington. She asked sme who administered the sacrament, who collected the offertory, and how it was I had not gone to lunch. I told her I came but found the gate barred against me, and that, in consequence of havneg a friend with me, I had gone through the villaee with him, and afterwards lunched with MIr. Htighmore. She said, *-"How en, you lay yourself under an obligation to those Highmores ? -if yen go to those Highmores you will not be acceptable at the Castle. Se keeps a most disreputable house, and you must take care of your character as well as of your friends'. They are alwvays playing at cards from morning to night. They are a set of drunken people. I know the truth of it, for Sir Francis Stanhope told me that he saw all three of them drunk upon the floor." The third person alunded' to wee 'the Dowager Countess of Elarrington. I told her I feared she had been sadly misinformed, as I had told her on vrevious 'occasions. I said, " I have found. Mr. Highinous's house nsicely or respectably conducted, and Mr. Highn4ore^ a lady of considerable talent and good.vnaoners^"- 'Isid, aIso, he had been very kind to me,. and th^at I found him very oh~aritable. Her Ladyship replied, " Oh, no, it cannot be;* it is impossible." I said I had had pleasiug evidence of the fact, for I bad seen him give both wine and muoney to the pOOr. She said, " Oh, no, it won't do, he is a bad mran and she isa oadi woman." I again said I feared she had been misinformed and, as a funeral was waiting, I must bid her good day. 'Aince then I have not been to the Castle. Between'the conversations which I have detailed I had several others, at which statements to the same effect were made. She has called him an actor, a mountebank, and a rider at Astley's. Cross-examined.-On the Monday afterwards I wrote a letter to a gentleman in Derbyshire, but otherwise I took no note in writing. Nobody else was present on the first occasion. It was in the drawing-room, before lunch, I learnt from 'Lady larrington that there had been a curate there named Colins, and from Mr. Highmore himself. IHe said he had 'had a ourate who had beendrunk, or alleged to be drunk. He did not say he had forwarded complaints to the Bishop. L3dy Tarrington said he -bad been found drunk in the parish, and been continued as curate. I was told by Lady Herrington4that Collins owed for his lodgings, left the pab in debt, and was freqently drunk. I heard also that there had been.cmrates namned White and Barratt. She did not say that White and Barrett werein the habit of accounting for the mcrament money aceoreing to the rubric. She did not say Mr. Highmore never xendered any zecount of the sacrament money,as other clergymen did. She mentioned a Mr. James, who she said had come 2s curate and left in debb, and was charged with swindling. I can't say whether Afr. Highmore told me he bad. She mentioned to me Mr. Collins as having been drtnk, but not J ames. Wlhen she advised me to take care of my owln eharaiter she had not immediately before mentioned Collins's drunkennems. As to the Duke of Leinster'g contribution, she did not say tbat Mr. Highmore had kept it several years before ,the ,repairs were done. I learnt that Mr. HighnorQ .bad received 101. towards the Tepairs- She did not 'say fhgt: -W.

IwrsinthehxbitofvsitingattheCastleduring the 'late Lord's fetime, I vook pis untL hIwas iwC a candidate for the neighboufing incusnbenoy. The Duke of leinsteP's nop hew, one of ray pupils, was complained of for having fired a gun with wadding In it, which hit a servant of the successful candaedate. No money was paid to the infirnary on account off'Sat complaint. The laarned JUDGX hereinterposed and maid that he could not sen the relevancy of thesexamination. Mr. MLLOnR said that tho circumstances into which he was Inquiring were important, as explaining the meaning of some expressions ueed by lady Harrington. Mr. Justice CRz&swm.n said that if Mr. Mellor, as gentleman of experience, would pledge himself that the evidence was material for that purpo8e the examination ic ght procceed MIr. Highmore, in answer to other questions, added,I found on inquiry that two of my pupils were out shooting, and that the Duke of Leinster's nephew, who was near'sighted, was allowed to discharge a gun once, which had only wadding in it, and by accident a min was hit, but not hurt. The money-collected for the repairs of the church I placed at tho disposal of the architect, Mr. Stevens, in 1853. I kept an account of the sacrament-money which was open to the inspection of every one. I am not aware that it is the practice for the churchwarden to take it. The rubrio does not require that. I was never asked about it except once by Mr. Jones, who asked me how I disposea of it. If I was asked by any one, I always told. I have been so seriously ill that I was told for some time I had better not take wine, and for three years I think I did not take three glasses. Re-examined.-The Dake of Leinster was looking at the church, and noticed the bad state of the west end. He said as he had two children buried there he would leave 104 with me to start the subscription. I preached a sermon for the same object, and collected about 61., and made it up to 71. The archdeacon came afterwards and ordered an alteration in the tower and bells, which prevented me from collecting more for the other repairs at that time. The Dowager Lady Harrington had a painted window put into the west end of the church, Then 1 had the repair. done, and the money was paid over to Mr. Stevens. I did not pocket it in any other sense than I have explained. I always give poor people things from my own house. I prefer purchasing them myself. More than two-thirds of the sacrament money were actually given in money. Mr. MELLOR then addreesed the jury for the defendants, and stated that Lady Harrington was anxious to be examined as a witness, to give her own accountof what had actually taken place at the interviews of which Mr. Jones had spoken; and he had no doubt that the jury would be satisfied that she had been very much misunderstood and misrepresented. The Countess of Harrington was then examined, and said, -Iremember Mr. Jones coming to officiate at Elvaston. It was the beginning of February or end of January. He used to come very often to lunch. It was with reference to my taking the sacrament that I asked him who was to administer it. He told me he did not know. I said I should not take it from Mr. Highmore. I said I had several reasons. I thought Mr. Highmore was not a good man. I said I took it at London, and Gawsworth. I said he had not accounted for the sacrament money. I never said he had appropriated the sacrament money. Mr. Thacker was my informant. He is churchwarden. I said Mr. White had always accounted to Mr. Thacker. A few days afterhe told meMr. Highmore, hebelieved,.would administer it. I said I should not take it. He then began to argue with me on the subject. I forget what his arguments were, but I -said, ."My. opinion remains unchanged,and we will not discuss this matter" further. I never used the word " pocketed.;" my words were that he did not account for the sacrament money. I- did not say "He keeps the sacrament money." I never said anything except that no account 'was rendered. I aid. the Dake of lainster had given 10C., and the farmers somidtbing-I think it was 201-to throw open the tower of the church. I said he had not done what the money was subscribed for for eight yeas. My husband, not liking to see the tower used as a coalhole, had offered to give the balance to have seats put there for the school children. It was then done during IMr.-Highmore's abtence. I said that there had been a great deal of bard,playing and gambling at the Castle in the late Lord's lifotire, and there was a great deal of card-playing in the village. I have seen little children playing at cards in the village. village I neveruseAl th -ord " debanchery." I said I had heardrumours of card-playing in his house; but of that'I could not judge, as I never was there. I did not say that he encouraged card-playing in the village. I said a bad example had been set iu the village, but I was alluding to the caurtes. I said there had been two drunkea curates. I mentioned Mr. James. I saw in the newspaper that he was appointed curate. He officiated, I believe,only once or twice. I did not say. that Mr. Highmore and his wife had been rolling drank on the floor. I said Mr. Collins had been rolling drunk on the floor. That was proved in the presence of Mr. Whittaker, the iTial dean, and another gentleman. I recollect Mr. Jones saying that he had found the gates locked, but I don't think he said that he had lunched at Mr. Highmore's. I never said anything about laying himself under an obligation to those Eighmores. I said the house had been very disorderly In that I alluded to the pupils shooting at a man named Burton, and tearing his coat with the wadding. I did not enter into details, but I said to Mr. Jonesthat the pupils had been disorderly. I told him he had been preceded by drunken curates, and that he must ther6fore be very careful about his character. I said, Sir Francis Stanhope had told me that he had seen Mrs. Foot drunk on the floor; but I never used the words " all three" drunk on the floor. And Sir Francis told me that there had formerly been a great deal of drinking at the Castle; but it could not apply to the late lord, who was the soberest of men. In using the expression "rollingon the fLoor" I aluded to Mr. Collins. All the conversations occurred between me and Mr. Jones when we were alone in the drawing-room before luncheon. When we went to London in April Mr. JonTes and I parted the best friends. He told me that Mr. Highmore had given bread and 2s. in money to one poor woman. He gave no other explanation about the sacrament money. Cross-examined.-I had only known Mr. Jones since he came to Elvaston. Mr. Collins left in 185L Mr. James offlciated about two or three years ago. There is a school which we built and which we support. I go there whenever I can. We have forbidden the schoolmaster and schoolmistress to have anything to do with Mr. Highmore. It is written up as one of the rules, "No clerical interference allowed." Ransom (the schoolmaster) and his wife had been in the habit of going to Mf Highmore's. I told the schoolmistress, in the school, on one occasion, that I would not allow her to go near the Eighmores. I was obliged to speakload,because the womanwas a virago, andwoald not llow me to speak quietly. I did not say that Mr. Highmore wDS a low fellow or a drunken fellow, or a ruffian or a villain. I did not say he was in the hAbit of getting drank with Ransom. I was not aware that Ransom drank. I did not say that he got drank with Chambers, the saddler. I may have said to Mr. Jones that he was an actor and a rider at Astley's, but that is -not in the declaration. (Laughter.) I did not say that to Mrs. Ransom. I have said that there had been ramours of his drinking before I came to Elvaston, but that his state of health was such that he could not drink now. I did not sa to Ellen Winson, "You are a bad, wicked. irl; Mr. Eighmore keeps you." I emphaticaUy deny that. I know Hal. 'lett. He is a discharged gamekeeper. I believe he is now in the Derby police ; -'bit I don't know whether Lord Harrington. gave him a cbaracter. I have not said to him that Mllen' Winson goes to Highmore's house and Highmore to her house for bad purposes. I did say to Catherine Smith that Mrs. Highmore kept Ellen Winson in a cottage as a spy upo us. I.hadaboy (ape) wno was constantly going there, and I thought he might get into bad company. 1did not seriously meau what I said to Catherine Smith; she is a poor girl who was recommended to me and whom I wanted to get into service. I did not say to Silvanus Smith, who was a servant at the Castle, that he was always as drunk as that fellow Highmore. Mr. Justice CnssNvELL ssked whether Mr. Ilacaulay proposed to call these persons, whose names he mentioned, as witnesses to contradict Lad; Barrington? Mr. MACAIULAY said, that it was for that purpose he was puattmgn thno questions. The ued JstDoE then expressed his opinion that that evidence would not be admissible, as the matters were not closely enough connected with the issue in the cause. Mr. MACAULAY said, he would not, then, continue the examination further. Lady Harrington, in reply to questions put by the learned JUDGE, said. that sho had declined to take the sacrament from Mr. Highmore and thought him a wicked man, because he had raised a terrier, and endeavonred to increase the tithes upon the poor people to an amount which the archdeacon had pronounced to be exorbitant, and on account of his appointment of bad curates; and that she had spoken of his house as disosderly on account of what E3ie had heard about his pupils It did occur to her that Mr. Highmore had ceased to take pupils for six years; but she mentioned it as a caution to Mr. Jones, because he was about to take pupils, and indeed had one pupil when she spoke to him. Mr. MELLOR havinz summed-up, .Mr. M.ACAULAY addressed the jury for the plaintiff, ana oonu-nented in- strong terms upon the evidence which Lad Hsarington had given, and to which he was sure the jury. would suot give credit. The letzrned JUDGE summed up, und The jmu found a verdiot for thb plaintift,-Damages 7501. There wars nother a~ction brbught ;by Mr. Highmore against Lordi H ringeon for an'asszult, arising out of pose. proceedings at a vestry zueeting'; but in this case a juror was withdrawn.

"Dear General Thompson,-1 was finporatily absent from the Houlse of Commons lAE Slght during the discussion relative to the war in Chistt, and did not hear yoar remarks. lV-e Times newspaper reports you to have said, in referenoo to the Huddersfield ele6tion, as follows :- "'Then there was fals4ood the third which camne d6wn to Eud daerledw, where a ma3t able and 'eepected tubUo ervant, formerly a member ot thix House, ras easldded rrom a seat.

"The gnarded manner in which these observations are worded prevent me, as am informed, from availing myself of the forms of the House of Commons to ask atah an explanation as I conceive that I may fairly claJmfrom you, inasmuch as you Sdect injuriously both upou myself ad the constitaency which I have the honour to represent. "Presuming.tha yon will admit the correctness of 'te report in 27c Time, may I ask you to infomn me what-was the falsehood to which you refer, whereby, s you insinuate, my honourable opponent, Mr. Cobden, was excluded froma a seat ia Parlivment ?

"My dear Sir,-Ishould have been mruch disappointed if the reports in the newspapers had made an opening far such amisappreheusion,as attributing thefalse news in question, either to you or to the electors of Huddersfield. What I'came down to Hudderdfieia' cannot be reasonably charged as originating in guddersfield. "The substance and the falsehood referred to is precisely as stated in Tc Times' report What it was intended, not to insinuate, but-to broadly put out, was that the arrival of this false news had an unfavoura le effect on Mr. Cobden's chances of election. "At the same time I feel the regret, common toWAll friends of the iAberal cause, that there shoald have been such misnmanagement as to have ever brought Mr. Cobden before the electors of Huddersfield, and particularly that it shouldhave brought him iUto collision with you, who had so many claris on their. support, and I should stilt more regret i anything arising out of the facts should have given you a mnoment's uneasiness, where the object in view was entirely in a different direction. "I remain, my dear sir, youms very sincerly, "T. PxsRRONEi's HOssrSON. E"dward Alcroyd, Esq., X.P." "7, Clarendon-place, Hyde Park-gardens July 23,1857. -i)ear Gener Thompson,-I am favoured with your courteous letter of the 22d, disclaiming any intention of attributing the false news in question either to myself or to the electors of Huddersfield. But the charge still remains, that Mr. Cobden was excluded from a seat in the House of Commons by a falsehood. Hence it follows that I obtained may seat by the same means, and that the Huddersfield constitnency was thereby 7nisled to reject my hon. opponent. You wnll therefore permit me to urge a more direct reply to my question, what was the falsehood to which you referred in your speech ? As you may not have a file of newspapers I at and for reference, you will oblige me by saying if the enclosed contemporary telegraphio message be that to which you alluded. Otherwise I wUll ask you to state precisely he facts upon which you found your imputation. "l am, dear General Thompson, very faithfully yours, "EDwARD AXBOYD. General Thompson, X.P." ENCLOSURE TO GENER, TEIoMpsoN. Extract from a telegruphic message from the Admiral at Malta to the Secretary to the Admiralty, dated the 24th of M Zarch: March :- " From the Agentat Suez, March 20. The Bombay brings no news of the Hind6stan. The passengers report that the night before they left Bombay a telegraphic message was received from Calcutta, stating that the mperor of China disapproved the proceedings of the Governor of Canton, and had given hima orders to conciliate 21, Old Buildings, Lincoln's.Inn, July 24,1857. "ly dear Sir,-You have furnished: me with the accurate knowledge of what I only knew. before by popular outcry. There can e no doubt that the communication of wich you send me a copy was what came down to Huddersfield, and had so unfavourable an effect on Mr. Cobden's c ehances of election. " Yours very truly. ".EROET TrgoapsozN. | "Edward Akroyd, Esq, M.D." SE T01PO 7, Clarenaon-place, Hyde Park-gardens, July 25, 1857. Dear General Thompson,-Your candid admission that , the communication of which I have sent you a copy was that to which you referred in your speech in the House of Commons happily enables me to disabuse your mind of an erroneous impression, and to refute your assertion that my constituents uere imposed upon by a falsehood to return mae in preferenee to Mr. Cobden. "II On a careful perusal of the telegraphic message which, in your opinaon, caused so disastrous a result, you will observe that it gives merely a flying rumour of the passengers l by ths Bombay, unsupported by official authority, thatthe Emperor of China dispproved the proceedings of the Governor of Canton, and had given him orders to conciliate the English. An idle report of such a character never passes caurrent as an admitted fact, and when subsequently contradicted cannot with propriety be stigmatized as a Ifalsehood. " But this pacific ramour was not promulgated in Hudersfield until the morning of Saturday, March 28, the polling-day-much too late to affect the issne of the election, even if the news had been of sufficient weight to have done so under any circumstances. As my own canvass-book testifies, the electors had previously resolved for whom they would vote, and their decision was not in the slightest degree affected at the last hour by this doubtful in- "i had more promises before the news arrived than I poled afterwards; or my friends deemed it necessary to record with so decisive a majority in my favour. "Mr. Cobden, when he first presented himself to the Huddersfield electors, put before them the real question at issue, and I will give you his own words :-'I cannot altogether avoid alluding to this Chinese question, because, whatever may be said by parties in this room, the public will consider that in my election at Huddersfield you will be passing judgment on this question, seeing that I havo been the "front and foremost man" in bringing it before you.' "I also staked my election upon the question raised bymy hon. opponent. The appeal was precisely that which Lnrd Dalmerston made to the country, and the verdict of the electors of Hnddersfield was given in terms unmistakable, honestly and truly in favour of the noble lord's policy. "I make every allowance for the disappointment you naturally feel at the defeat of your friend-I may say our friend-Mr. Cobden. You came over to Huddersfield from Bradford on the day of election in a carriage and four to ehare his triumph, hut you had the mortification of witnessing his discomfiture, and you departed quietly and discreetly from the battle-field, the mournful herald of his rejection. " Now that the British lion has gone to sleep, after the growl of a general election, he may be bearded with impunity, but your own experience at the late Bradford election mast have taught you that it is unsafe to run counter to the national feeling, or to outrage the sense of national honour by the tame permission of insults to our British flag. "The publicity of your own remarks warrants my request that our correspondence be published, with the addition of any letter you may think it desirable to add. "With the assurance of my personal respect for your public services, and of my regret that any cause of contro versy should have arisen between us, "Believe me, dear General Thompson, " Very faithfully vours, "" EDWARD AKROYD. "General Thompson, KW ."
WIT0HCRAFT IN BRISTOL.-An elderly man named Skinner, residing at St. Philip's, was charged yesterday before the Bristol magistrates with an assatilb on a person namedFinch. From the evidence of the complainant it appeared that on Sanday evening he was told that Skinner wished to speak to him. He went out to him, upon which the defendant, without giving him time to say! anything, struck him a heavy blow' over the head with a walkingstick, saying at the same time, " Yo -, see what yon have put on meO" Finch at first denied any knowledge of the cause of the assault, but upon cross-examinrta tion by Mr. Tucker, who appeared for the defendant, and from the evidence of Miss Skinner, the true state of the case seemed to be that Fincb, in conjunction with two other men named M'Calloch and Brown, had succeeded in persuading the old man (Skinner) that he was suffering from " witchcraft," and that they could remove or increaee his afflictions at their pleasure, they being adepts in the "black art." On one occasion they prevailed on him to go out and purchase a heart, which was to be stuck full of pihs and then roasted, he being assured that if this were done he would recover. The heart was bought by the defendant, but Mrs. Skinner, with more sense than her husband, would not allow the process to be pursued in her house. So great had b-en the effect of these practices on Skinner's mind that his intellect had failed him, and it was evident from his demeanour before the magistrates that he was verging on lunacy, and they therefore merely fined the defendant the coats of the sumaons. The complainant was also cautioned that in pursuing the- practices atleged he might render himself liable to be committed as a rogue and vagabond. Mr. Tucker intimated that it was his intention to prefer a charge against Finch and his companions as soon as he had procured the necessary evidenoe.
