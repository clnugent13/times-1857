OXFORD CERCUIT. _ - - STAFFORD. DEc. 10. mr. naron nartin arrived in this town from Glocester yesterday, and opened the commission for the county of Stafford. His Lordship afterwards attended Divine service at St. Mary,s. His Lordship took his seat in court this morning at 10 o'clock, and proceeded with the trial of prisoners. The calendar for this county is unusuaUy heavy for a winter assize, and contains the names of no less than 50 prisoners charged with offences of an aggravated character. Two are charged with wilful marder, five with manslaughter nine with burglary, 17 with highway robbery, three witf~ uttering or being possessed of forged notes, tvro with n~ht pcoaching, four with ctting and wounding, one h g with intent, one with larcny, one with making a false declaration, one with obtaining money by false pretences, one wth concealing a birth, and three with (Before Mr. Baron MARTnz.) Samuel Smart, aged 33, a letter stamper, was charged with stealing r. post letter containing money, the property of the Postmaster-General, August 7th, 1857, at Walsall. The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and AMr. Baron MWAsTsi, in passing sentence, said he had no doubt of the prisoner's guilt, and that he had greatly aggrvated his offence by eudeavouring to screen himself by casting an imputation upon the postmaster. His Lordship then sentenced the prisoner to six years' penal servitude. Sarah Cherrlngton, aged 52, was charged with the manslaughter of Susannah Cartwright, on the 17th of September, 1857, at Sedgiey MIr. A,S. Hillappearedforthe prosecution. Mr. lKenealy defended the prisoner. It appeared that the deceased was a poor woman, aged 33, living at Sedgley, and the mother of seven children. Being in the famlyway, and so poor as not to be able to pay for the services of a medical man, she engaged the prisoner to attnd her in her confinement. This took place on the 17th of Septembar, when the prisoner attended, and assisted. The child was born alive, but the placenta did not come away for about an hour and a half. During this time there was considerable hoemorrhage, and the poor woman appeared to be dying. Ultimately, the prisoner removed the placents, and almost immediatelyafterwards the poor woman died. A medical mauwas then sentfor, and it was discovered that the uterushad been entirelytorn away along with the placenta, and this, according to the medical testimony, caused the death. On the cross-examination of the witness, it appeared that the prisoner bore an excellent character for humanity and kindness; and it transpired that, though she had a family of children, she had adopted an Infant child whose mother and father and famUy had died of cholera in 1832. Mr. KJNENLY having addressed the jury for the prisoner, she was found GuiRy, with a strong recommendation to mercy. Mr. Baron MAwR=c said there could be no doubt that the prisoner had been actuated by the kindest feelings, and the only object of the prosecutton was to teach others that they must not undertake such responsible duties without having a competent degree of skill. His Lordship then erdered the prisoner to be discharged upon her own recognizances to appear and receive judgment if caUed upon. Thomas Wileon, aged 29, glazier, was charged with stealig the sum of 15s. from the dwelling-house of Joseph Hal, on the 5th of November, 1857, at Westbromwich. He was also charged, upon a second indictment, with cutting and wounding the prosecator, with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension, and to do some grievous bodily harm. r. Motteram appeared for the prosecution. The prisoner waS undefended. was undefended. ta.t about half-past G o'clock on the evening in question the prosecuor's wife went uD to her bedroom, and found it locked on the inside. She at once gave the alarm, and her husband saw the prisoner make his escape from the bedroom wiudow down the roof of a stable. The prisoner then ran across the garden, and was followed by the prosecutor, and while in the act of scaling the wall was puUed back. Ie then drew a life-preserver and used It with great violeno on the prosecutor's head, but he was secured, and when searched a number of housebreaking Im. plements were found in his pockets, The prosecutor sustained considerable injury, but considering the powerful stature of his assailant it was wonderful that more serious and fatal injury was not inflicted. The prisoner had removed the sum of 15s. from a bowl of coppers which he found in the bedroom, but in his haste to snake his escape he had left the money on the drawers. The jury found the prisoner Guiltu on both indictments. Mr. Baron MARTrIN said he had no doubt that the pri- wasa pofesed housebreaker, ho had embarked in a -nosthazadous enterprse which muight have proved fatal. As a warning to him and others, his Lordship said he would pass a severe sentence, whEich was that he be kept in penal servitude for 20 years. DEcEMmzR 12. (Before Mr. Baron MARiu;.) Elizabeth Littlhiales, aged 38, was charged with the manslaughter of Sarah Ann 'Oloud, on the 17th of October, at Wolverhampton, Mr. WMahon appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Keneay defended the prisoner. It appeared that the prisoner was the wife of a working man who was much addicted to drinking, and that on the 16th of October last she was driven out of hor house and compelled to take refuge in the bouse of a neighbour, where she stayed aU night, The next morning she was seen to run out of the house with a poker in her hand, followed by her husband; and as she was runing into her house she threw the poker at her husband. The poker missed, and, faUing upon the ground, rebounded with great violence, end the point struck a little girl who was sitting on a door stop. The point of the poker entered the child's nostril and penetrated the brain and so caused the chUd's death. Mr. KERELy having addressd the jury for the prisoner, the jury found her Gizilty. His LonDsmz' sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for two calendar months, with hard labour. George Priest, aged 35, engineer, was charged with the inausiauhter of Aaron Davie8, on the 7th of November, 1857, at Darlaston. MIr. Boughey appeaired for the prosecution; Mr. Kettle defented the priSDonr. The prisoner was aD enginemas, inX the employ ol Mir.

AERICA. SOUTHAMPTON, DEC. 12. The United States' mail steamship Ariel, Captain Ludlow, arrived to-day at noon with advices from New York to the 28th ult., being two days later than those brought by the City of Washington. The Ariel has 160 passengers for England, France, and Germany, and S30,0OO in specie for Havre. She has come into dock to coal, and then proceeds to Havre and Bremen. The most important item of news by this arrival is the state of affairs respecting Kansas, which question has again suddenly assumed a gloomy and threatening aspect. The cause of difference between President Buchanan and Governor Walker is thus stated by the New York Herald:- "The President holds the ground that the Knsas Le. compton Convention was a legitimate convention; that it had the law authority to frame a State constitution ; that it should have submitted such constitution bodily to the vote of the people; but that, in submitting the question of Islavery' or I no slavery' to the popular vote, the only mnaterial queation at iesue was satisfactorily provided for, and that accordingly tho immaterial reservatimn of the Convention might be overlooked. Governor Walker, on the other hand, emphatioally declares that this Lecompton constitutional programme is an outrage upon the peopie of Kansas-a shameless violation of all the principles of free government; that the constitution in question is yet a secret document in the territory, still in the hands of the committee, to be altered or amended as they may think proper, and that an effort on the part of Congress to force this constitntion upon the people of Kansas, without their voice baing heard for or against lt, will he surely followved by rebellion and a bloody civil war." Despatches from Washington state that Buchanan and Walker had an interview of five hours! duration on the 26th ult., when a very friendly interchange of their respective views was said to have taken place, and a second meeting was fixed for the morning of the 28th. The Cabinet was In session until a late hour on the 27th, the Kansas difficulty being, of course, the principal theme of discussion. The President submitted all the facts, and firmly expressed his sentiments on the subject. His position had been taken, and a high sense of public duty admonished him to adhere strictly to it. In this view the Cabinet were unanimous. In reference to the Mormon difficulty a despatch from Washington of the 27th sayS:- IGeneral Smith is stiU here, consulting with the Govern. ment relative to Utah affairs. It is not improbable that General Joseph Lane wlU be commissioned to proceed to California and conduct the war against the Mormons. Near $2,000,000 will have been expended on the expedition. They have 2,000 men, 1,500 waggons, and 13,000 animals, and more quartermasrers than the English had in their Crimean expedition !" The President's message was said to be finished, except that part of it relating to Kansas. He would recommend a considerable increase in the army. Senators and members were slowly arriving at Wasbington. "The market for money (says the New York Times of the 28th, in its review of the previous day's financial operations),- "Keeps generaly quiet and easy. There is not much doing in discounts outside of the banks, and the offerings at several of the large banks this morning were quite moderate. There is some improvement in trade, particularly in grocories and leather, by jobbing lots, aud in dry goods among the city retailers, but the bulk of busiress in this way Is for cash, and there is not much new paper making at short dates by first-rate parties. At caU money is offered at 7 per cent. freely, and in some instances at 6 per cent., without full employment; and the involuntary tendency of the bank movement is rather to contraction than expansion. The steamer tomorrow is the Ariel, for Southampton and Bremen. The mail will not be a large one. Short sight exchange is firm on London and Paris at about specie p-oint, while 60-day bi1ls are irregular and daull; on London, 108 to 1091; Pards, 5 27~ to 5 22. The Vanderbilt and Africa delivered about $300,000 in gold from Europe, which is more than from present appearances wiU be wanted for the packet to-morrow. American gold is worth 100J to 1001 per cent. ; Ecglish rovereiOns, $4 86G. to $4 S3o.; napoleons, $3 86c. to $3 84o. for 20f. pleces ; Philadelphia Funds, 974 to 98 ; Baltimore, 9J6A to 97; Boston, 991 to 991. Advices from New Orleans by telegraph to. day report an active movement in cotton, at 121c. for middling. " The Eales of cotton on the 27th were confined to small lots, based upon good middling unlands at 12z., showing an advance of about Ac. per lb. The oclosing of the canals, combined with a good Eastern and speculative demand for flour and grain, caused prices to advance. The receipts weree free, but were excpected ere long to become seriously dimininshed, so far as the river and canals w ere available. The receiptt for two days w ere as followvs: '- Bare TIECAALS A?D NoarI nIVE. Flour, tarries.2* * *13i.ss Corn. bashel,-.. 8.685 Oats. bushel3s.. . . . . .11,003 Barley, bu shel, .. ..r E..

Sargars werer sold to tbe extont of about 1,000 hhds., at 5sc. to 5'ic. for refining, 7ISc. for Porto Rico, and 64C. to 0izo. tor Cuba muscovado. Coffee was in moderate request, and prices unchanged. Freights to British ports were irregular, and engagements light. Tobacco, inl hhds., was taken to London at 25s., and logvvood to Bremen at 3es."
THE PRESTON WILL OASE.-The accused gentleman, Mr. Alderman MIonk, is 61 years of age, and his surgery is sltuated in a narrow passage, off Lune-etreet, lFisher. gate. Mrs. Pipe, the writer of the body of the forged will, is apparently from 35 to 40 years of age, and the residence of her husband, Mr. G. W. Pipe, hairdresser and perfumer, is in Fishergate, not far from Mr. Monk's surgery. She is a woman of very superior educational attainments, and the penmanship of the forged will is exceedingly beautiful, A singular circumstance, it is currently reported, and on good authority, led to the discovery of the writer. On Thursday, the 3d inst., the cir. cumstanco of hr. Monk's apprehension that afternoon en. grossed all the conversation of the publio, and it wasacasually mentioned by som-e ladies in Mr. Pipe's shop. Mrs. Pioe on hearing the news, displayed considerable emotion and fainted, and this circumstance, coupled with other facts -which had come to the knowledge of the police, led to inqu-ry, and it was found that Msrs. Pipe had been a frequent visitor at the prisoner's surgery. Some of ber writing was procured-receipts of accounts-and its striking resemblance to the writing in the forged will confirmed the suspicions which had been entertained. On being challenged with being the writer of the document in question, she at once confessed the part sbe had taken in the traniection. It is expected that some astounding revelations will be made at the trial as to this particular part of the forgery. The only portions of the document now unaccounted for are the e gnatures of the testator, "Edward Turner, Preston ;" ani of one of the witnesses, "Joseph Wilkinson, Plreston." The former is evidently in a feigned hand; and Mr. Adland, engraver, of Hatton-garden, London, will be caUed as a skilled witness to give evidence upon that point. It is also reported that tbe police have got evidence as to the person who wrote Wilknson's signature. The entire case is more like a romance than a reality. It was only the other day that Mr. Monk sat upon the bench beside his brother magistrates, before whom, on Tuesdey last, he stood a culprit, cbarged with the high crime of forgery. As we have already stated bail was refused, and we understand from his solicitor that it is not his intention to apply to the judges for his liberation on baiL He will, therefore, remain in the Preston House of Correction until thenext spring assizes at Lancaster. Mr. Monk was mayor of Preston in 1852, when Her Majesty passed through that town on her return from Balmoral, and he and the corporation attended at the railway station and presented an address to Her Majesty. The prisoner's name is also inscribed upon the monument to Sir Robert Peel, in Winckley.square, Preston, and on the fire-engine station in St. John-street; the former having been inaurated and the lattor erected during his year of office.- ifanchster Guardian. *.THS, AusTIthLTAN ANID TASMANIAN RiIVERS.- As nons of the rivers in this part of the globe have salmon inhabiting their waters, we understaxd a trial is to be made to transport either the ova or the fish, and the superintendent of the fishings at Perth has been consulted upon the beqt method for effecting that object. The ova ot fish that live and spawn in still water we imagine would not be difficult to carry alunost any distance, but ova which require running streams to ha'ch in will need a vast amount of attention bestowed on them to insure success. Tranrporting the adult salmon caught on its way to the sea, or even the smoult, and confining thom in a well in theship, is the most likely method of succeeding, but even here the temperature of the water in crossing the line would require to be lowered by artificial means. From 60 tO 70 days may be considered as an average passage, and few salmon remain as long as that at; one time n salt vater-Glaspow Daily THE NRw ZEALAND GOLDF[ELDS.-The reports from the Nelson goldfields continue as satisfactory as ever. The gold is evidently scattered over a large district, and although difficult to be worked is obtained in large quantities, while its quality is highly spoken of. The influence of the diggings was beginning to make itself felt in the other provinces, and the numberof persons flocking to them from all quarters in the colony was largely on the increase, iruch to the annoyance of the employers of labour and to the perplexity of those provinces which had voted large surns for immigration, and were getting alarmed lest their money should have been devoted only to swell the numbers at the goldfields. Still, as the crowd there must be fed, it was expected that a very valuable market would be opened, to the great nefit o' the agricultural producers who, with thiose who sez supplying the wants of the miners, were 1icely to reap . better return than even the tbe latter t elves~-Ageia7s en(? aruZ ZLaland Gaz4.
EHB PBRYINSULAR MAILS. (By BLECTP.IC ASD INTERNATI0NAL TElEGRAPT.) SOUTHAMPTON, MONDAY MORNING. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Tagus, Captain Christian, hag arrived with mails from Gibraltar to the 6th, Cad'z 7th, Lisbon 9th, Oporto and Vigo 10th. She brings nine passengers, 10,S70. in specie, and a cargo of fruit, &c On the 8th the Englishscrew Eteamer Myth was towed up to Lisben by the Infanta Dona Luiza, dismasted, with screw breken, and other damages to machinery. The English brig Maria, of Weymouth, Cousins master, in going into the Tagus struck on the North Cuchaes Bank, and had to be beached, which was done abreast of the town of Traffraria ; the greater portion of the cargo will be saved, but the ship has become a total wreck. She was bound to Valencia, from Haamburg; all the crew were saved, five of them being brought home by the Tagus. Dec. 5, at 10.30 am., the Tagus passed the bark Star of the East, towing the brig Princess Rtoyal, of Sanderland, Into Cadiz Bay, dismasted. Dec. 7, at 3 p.m., in lat. 36.28 N., long. 6.59 W., she passed a paddle-steamer, supposed to be the Euxine; 8th, off the Tagus, passed the steamer Indus, steering south ; 9th, passed the Dutch barkStadarius, at anchor in Cascades Bay dismasted, but not being in distress, the Tagus did not render assistance, as the bark had telegraphed to Lisbon for a a tug; 10th, passed the Alhambra, steering for Vigo; 11th, at 1145 a.m., in lat. 44 20, long. 8 38, passed the steamer Aheona with troops, steering south-west. Her Majesty's steamer Curlew was at Gibraltar. The James Booth, for Australia, put in dismasted. At Lisbon the weather continued bright and cold, and the fever was expected soon to disappear altogether. The new cases during ten days upto 10 p.m. on the 7th were 892, and the deaths 385, being a great reductton from the previous ton days, when 1, 612 new cases and 598 deaths were reported. The Cortes were to assemble on the day the packet left. The Deputy for Madeira, AL Jose Silvestre Ribeiro, had been appointed Minister of Juse.ice The 8th balng a close holyday at Lisbon, the Brail bills by the Tyne did not appear on 'Change; on the 7th, when London paper was more scarce and the de;nand for three months at 54g greater than for some time past, short hills were very scarc at 53j for 30 days' sight. On the Continent few transactions took place, the rates at three months being-Paris, 515; Amsterdam, 43,; Hamburg, 48i ; and Genoa, 514. Some purthases of stock have been made; rates had impzovcd for Three per Cents.-namely, registered, 45.' to 46; counons, 45 to 45A, both ex. dividend; and Deferred, 26i to 27 2 Bank of Portugal Sixes, 8 to 9 per cent. premium; and Oporto, 22 to 6ibraltar exchanges on the 6th were quoted-London, 492.; Paris, 5 31; AarseiLles, 5 32; Genoa, 535. The Ocean had pnt into Gibraltar leaLj, and would have to discharge cargo-railway iron-to repair.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Slr,-It is to be hoped that prejudice and pedantry 'will shortly give place to the dictates of common sense. There are few who will not have been gratified by your observations, called forth in noticing Lord Iardwicke's spcech in the House, with reference to the transport of troops to the East on the breaking out of the mutiny. It is as absurd as 't is inconceivable that such a nrmber of ships should have been allowed at that crisis to lie, worse than idle, rotting at their moorings, at a time that ;n erormous sacrifice of money was demanded to supply merchant ships for the very nurpcses for which the national ships were so admirably adapted, and lunmediately available. That such a ship as the Austria should have been engagcd for this purpose, a foreign vessel, 'whle a choice was to have been made out of a number of two-docked ships, vith a troderate steam power, that might have conveyed the regiment embarked in that vessel in perfect comfort to their destination. I 'will take one vessel, which most probably at that particular moment was perfectly arsilab'e, had hercrew on board, with her hold between decks clear,-the Agamemnon, just returned fromn her voyage 'with the Atlantic cable. ShIe was perhaps paying-off as the Austria was being engaged. I enclose a list of ships that, by the Nasvz List of July, would appear to hsave been avaiable had the desire to emnloy thema existed; all steam ships of moderate power and well suited to the purposes required; all two-decked hips. Had I put down the names of ships with three decks or steam power, ti*e list might have been doubled; and here I zvOulu ask whether such a demonstration of power and might as the sending forth such an army as left oir shores on that occasion in men-of-war of the class described, might not have had a higher moral effect througl-oat the world in deterring the King of Naples or Emperor of China from attempting an Inva:sion of our country than a few loose expresdons thrown out at a civic feast whch might be aocepted as intended for Pu2y one of the foreign AMinisters seate atthe same board. Sir C. Wood, in justifying the employment of sailing ships, appears to have been hopelessly ettrayed. It is inconceivable how a man holding such an office as his could have fallun into so gross an error. What in the world has produced such an insrense steam fleet as England possesses but the fact that steam ships have proved themselves more efficient than saling ships ? But even in that case the sailing ships suitable for the conveyarce of troops for the East, no w and then, lying rotting at their moorings, are Innumerable-two-decked frigates-the Aiions, Aias, q)0 guns; the Afrieas and A.ethusas, 50-no eod of them. why were these not employed? Officers? Take up the NVary Li-t; they are to he counted by hundreds, brokenhearted men, beguiled, seduced in early life into the service, only tofind, whentoo late, that whatever hopes they may hare entertained intheirdreams, the waking reality consigns them to a retired list.

THE RELIEF o0 Lucnrowv.-The following is an extract from a letter written by Ml. de Banneroi, a French physician, in the service of Mussur Rajab, and published in Le Pays (Paris paper) under the date of Calcutta, Oct. 8:-" I give you the following account of the relief of Luck. now, asdescribed by a lady, one of the rescued party :-' On every side death stared us in the face ; no human skill could avert it any lonnger. We saw the moment approach when we must bid fareweU to earth, yet without feeling that unutterable horror which must havo been experiencedby the unhappy vietims at Cawupore. We were resolved rather to die than to yield, and were fully per. suaded that in 24 hours all would be over. The engineers had said so, and all knew the worst. We women strove to encourage each other, and to perform the light duties which had been assigned to us, sulch as conveying orders to the batteries and supplying the men with provlsions, especialy cups of coffee, which we prepared day and night. I had gone out to try and make myself use'ul, in company with Jesste Brown, the wife of a corporal in my husband's regiment. Poor Jessie had been in a state of restless excitement all through the slege, and had faUen away visibly within the last few days. A constant fever consumed her, and her mind wandered occasionaUy, espe. eaily that day, when the recollections of homie seemed powerfully present to her. At last, overcome with fatigue, she lay down on the ground, wrapped up in her plaid. I sat beside her, promising to awaken her when, as sbe said, I her father shoutld return fromn the ploughing.' She fell at length into a profound slumber, motionless and, apparently, breathless, her head re3ting in my lap. I rmyself could no longer resist the inclination to sleep, in spite of the continual roar of the cannon. Saddenly I was aroused by a wild unearthly scream close to my ear; my companion stood upright beside rce, her arms raised, and her head bent forward in the attitude of listening. A look of intense delight broke overher conntenance, shegrasped my hand, drew me towards her, and exclaimed, Dinna ye hear it . dinna ye hear it? Ay, I'm no dreamin', it's the slogan o' the Highlanders! We're saved, we're saved!' Then, flinging herself onher knees, shethanked God with passionate fervour. I felt utterly bewildered my English ears heard only the roar of artiUery, and I thought my poor Jessie was stlU raving; but she darted to the bat'eries, and I heard her cry incessantly to the men, 'Courage ! courage! hark to the slogan,-to the dlacgregor, the grandest of them a'. Here's help at last ! To describe the effect of these words upon the soldiers would be impossible. For a moment they ceased firing, and every soul listened in intense anxiety. Gradually, however, there arose a murmur of bitter disappointment, and the wailing of the women who had flocked to the spot burst out anew as the colonel shook his head. Our duU lowland ears heard nothing but the rattle of the musketry. A few inoments more of this death-like suspense, of this agonizing hope, and Jessie, who had again sunk on the ground, sprang to her feet, and cried, in a voice so clear and piercing that it was heard alongthe whole line-' Willye no believe it noo? Tho slogan has ceased indeed, but the Campbells are comin'? D'ye hear, d'ye hear !' At that moment we seemned indeed to bear the voice of God in the distance, when the pibroch of the llighlanders brought us tidings of deli. verance, for now there was no longer any doubt of the fact. That shrill, penetrating, ceaseless sound, which rose above aU other sounds, could come neither from the advance of the enemy, nor from the work of the Sappers. No, it was indeed the blast of the Scottish bagpipes, now shrill and harsh, as threatening vengeance on the foe, then in softer tones seeming to promise succour to their frienda in need. Never surely was there such a scene as that which followed. Nlot a heart in the residency of f.ucknow but bowed itself before God. All, hsy one simulcaneous impulse, fell upon their knees, and nothing was heard bat bursting sobs and the mnurmured voice of prayer. Then all arose, and there rang out from a thousand lips a great shout of joy which resounded far and wide, and lent new vigour to that blessed pibroch, To our cheer of " God save the Qween," they replied by the well-Lown strain that moves every Scot to tears, "Should auld acquaintance be forgot," &o. After that, nothing else made any impression on me. I scargely reneiteber what followed. Jessie was presented to the General on his entrance into the fort, and at the officers' banquet her health was drunk by all present, whlle the pipers marched round the table playing once ruore tbo famiUIar air of ' Auld la3g syn."'-Jersey 2Tfncs, of Deo, 10,

The following are the rceipts of railways for the peat week:_ ROYAL SWEDISH. A speclal general meeting of this company was held on Saturday at the London Tavern, to consider the propriety of authonzmg the directors to treat for the sale of the railway, &c., to the Swedish Government; Mr. W. J. Chaplin in the chair. The report of Mr. G. Miller, the managing director In Sweden, an abstract of which appeared in The Times, was taken as read. The CHnsf m.N said it was very gratifying to them that their managing direotor had been enabled to economize expenditure, regatn the company's credit, and maintain its efficiency out of the funds placed at his disposaL The report had been circulated among the shareholders. Mr. Austin had inspected the railway, and had the honour to accompany the Prince Regent over the line on the day of opening, which excited considerable interest. Any questions they might wish to ask with regard to these matters they would hs haupy to answer. The accounts would not be made up until the end of the financial year, on the 31st of December, so that he was noet prepared at present to lay any financial statement before them. They would take the earliest opportunity of calling them together after the accounts of the current year were made up. The line had been opened so late in the autumn, and without a suffident number of waggons to accommodate the mineral traffic, that the result of their working to the end of the year would form no criterion of what the traffic would be when developed. Any information on that subject could be obtained at the office. They had convened the present meeting with a view to save time, as the Diet would close at Christmas, and if they did not embrace the present opportanity the matter would stand over for some time. On a former occasion the directors had been authorized to negotiate with the Swedish Government for the disposal of the property, but as the authority was conditional the Government refused to treat with them on the subject. Under the resolution of a former meeting the directors submitted to the authorities two or three different propositions with respect to disposing of the property, obtaining a guarantee of interest for 40 years, an extension of time to complete the works, and the return of the caution-money of 11,0001. But in all these endeavours they failed, because in accordanee with the rules of the Government and Diet in treating with com papanmes, they would not negotiate with the directors on the part of the company urnless they had a direat authority to that effect from the ihareholdera. With aw view to a final negotiation they had convened the present meeting to obtain the requisite authority. From their experience in Sweden, and the extreme change that had taken place in the times, they had withdrawn the petition they had presented to the Crown. They saw that a valuation of the property would probably be a very tedious affair,the usual practice for a valuation being to appoint two arbitrators by the State and two by the eompany, the fonr gentlemen having power to appoint an umpire stould it be necessary. In order to avoid that delay they proposed to offer the line, works, &S., for 400,0001. If the line were to be taken at a valuation, whatever sam that might amount to, the State would have to add 25 per cent. premium for the purchase under the terms of the first charter. As to the pro osition for a guarantee on 611,000l. at 6 per cent., inelu ing a sinking fund, to complete the whole undertaking, they consulted with their friends in Sweden, and taking their own views of the case they preferred a sale of the undertaking as it stoed to completing theline. Should the difficulties of the times operate against payment in cash tbey would offer to take State bonds at par for the amount of the nurchase moDey. (Hear.) There were three parties who Would be concerned in the result of the sale-n-mely, the original shareholders, the bondholders, and the preference sh.re. holders; but it would not be desirable to discuss as to how the purchase money should be divided until they had it to divide. He had taken his proportion of bonds; nd preference shares and so had other members of the board, none of ther had parted with their shares. With regard to the mode in which the produce of the sale should be disposed of, he would suggest that a committee consiting of three infiaential mermbers of each class should he appointed to confer with the directors on the subject, and, if they could not decide, to refer the question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Governor of the Bank of Eng.ind, or Mr. Gladstone. The directors were of opinion tha' each class should make some sacrifice. Atr. MOCATTA could not agree to a Sale of the line. He bnlieved the object was to tell the line for the purpose of Tnying the ohligation holders. He advised them to wait for botter times ; ho did not expect any liberality from the S vedish Government, and suggested that the meeting sbould ha adjourned to a future day, He would forbid the sale of the line, and if necessary take Chancery proceedings to preveat it. He proposed an amendment to the effeut that the line should not be sold for a less sam than would be suffi. cleat to pay the original shareholders los. or 11. a share, the preference ehareljolders 41. per share, and obligation holders 21. 15s. per obligation. Mr. AiDnENVS seconded t"v-amendment. A long discussion then ensued, in the course of which it was stated that the manner in which the line bad been op-ned, and the display on that occasion had had a most beaefieial effect on the company. It was the iuterest of every clas3 of holder th arrive at an amicable adjustment of theirclaimse They oould not expect more than the fair value of their property, and 25 per cent. abova that amotnt 'when taken by the Government. It could not be supposed that the Govermment should pay for the frauds of the Late lr. Sadleir. There were now 98,00O original shaes ini the company, 39,591 preference shares, and 32,¢00 obIgations. The bonds wrere Issed aS 41., repayJable at 54 each at the end of 40 years. The bonds at 41 each would amount to .28,000, and the preference shares at 41. each to 100,000, makrng together 288,000; the remainder ab73ve that sum that might be obtained would go to the origlal Mr. MILLE, in reply to quastions, said, he believed they had a fine proPerty provided their line were made part of the through Stste line; but as there was same donbt as to how other lines were to be carried out he thought it desirable to part with the property If they could find a purchaser, but if thelr line were to form part of the through or State lie he would say they had be;ter keep the 35 mIle of line they had lreadv made. After some further observatioDs, The CJBrxA moved a resolution to the effec5 that the directors bo authorized t proaed to a sale of the property, plant, and stock of the company at a fixed prioe, or at a valuation, by arbitratiou, in the mode specified by the statutes of the oompany, taking for the parchase either cau or State bonds of the Swedish Government at par value. Mr. HAuRcinGP wconded the motion. Ay amendment for the appointment of a committee an the adjournment of the meeting was thea put, and negatived by a large majority. The amendment, moved by Mr. MocA.Tr,t ani seconded by Mr. ANDREW, after some observati ,ns br Mr. SEYMOURs, was withdraswn, and the original moti in ws then carried unanimouel It was stated thd they expected to realize a considerable amount on aooount of their claim on the property of the late Mr. Sadleir. Resolutions were also pased, authorizing the directors to agree with the Government for the direction of the line, approving the statement of the chairman, and thanking the dl.c..rs for their attention to the interests of the company. The meeting then separated. CRAITBROOK AND XARDEN. An adjorned meeting was held at Cranbrook on Friday In order to oonsider a proposltion for the formation of a railway from that place to the main line ef the SouthEastern Railway at Marden. The chair was occupied by Mr. B. Tooth. The ILne now proposed differs from that originally projected, and was stated to present mauy advantages. The work of formation would be very light upon about one-half the lne, but very heavy on the other portion, and aboat a third would be through hard sandstone. The cost of the worls was stated to be estlmated at 38 0001., and the land, enucneerng, and other expenses, 10,0001 Mr. COBB said the South-Eastern Company spoke of the lne with great favour, and the principal landowners adong the proposed route were with one exception unanimous in its favonr. Eesolutlons were passed approving the proposed railway, and statirng that, as Mr. Cobb had assured the meeting that he could obtain subscriptions for 2,000 shares, the committee be reqrested to ascertain whether the remainng 3,000 could be subscribed for, nd report progress at an adjourned meeting. MIDLAND. It appears that Mr. John Bills has retired from the chair of this company, and that be still retains a meat at the board as a director of the company. EDENH4M AND BYTHAX This line, a branch of the Great Northern from the Bytham station to Edenham, was opened for traffic last week.
FRIGHTFUL CO1LLIroT In A RAULROAD TuN?r\x.- The first accident which has taken place in either of the tunels leading from New-street station since the opening of the Stonr ValUey line five years ago occurred on 'Rhursday, and was unfortunately attended with somewhat serious results. The rules laid down for the working of these tmnnels are framed on the admirable principle (in such matters) of believing something to be wrong until the conxtrary is known. At neither end is a train allowed to enter until the signalman has ascertained, by telegraphie message sent to the other end, that the particular line of raUs about to be used Is clear, Neglect apart, accident with such a system at vwork is almost impossible; and that It is practicaUy all-sufficient is proved by the fact that, with nearly 70 incoming er outgoing trains per day passing through each tunnel, this is the first time any coUision has oocurred. The circumstances are briefly these --The 12.45 Liverpool third-class train left the station at the usual time. Five or six minutes afterwards the driver of an engine wvhich had just been detached from an incoming train, wishing to proceed to the Crescent engine shed for a supply of coke, asked the signalman at the station end of the tunnel whether he might proceed. Receiving an answer in the affirmative, he drove his en,ine and tender up the tunnel at the usual speed. Within6 or 70 yards of the other end he suddenly came in collision vith a train on the same line of rails, and this, it turned out, was the one which had shortly before left the station for LiverpooL The concussion was a very severe one, though much less than if the train had been stationary. Occumring within the tunmel, the alarm felt was of course greatly increased. As soon as the train emerged into daylight, it was found that a good deal of damage had been done both to rson and proty. The passengers were greatly terrifiea aud this was heightened by the bruises and wounds which it was seen many of them had sustained. The sufferers were speedily taken from the carriages, and, surgeons being sent for, the injuries of all were attended to on the spot as far as possible, while a man and woman, who seemed the most seriously hurt, were sent to the General Hospital, As we have said, the train was a third-class one, and, as is usual in accidents where this is the case, injuries were sustained by a large number. At least 16 or IS persons were more or less hurt. Mr. J. Brown, connected with the store department at Buston-square station, had his nose split and knee contused; a woman named Goldstraw, from Glamorganshire, who was going with her husband and family to Stoke-on-Trent, sustained a compound fracture of tbe leg; a gentleman from Liverpool was badly bruised on the head; five or six others had bruises about the head and upper part of the body, which one of the surgeons caUed in describes as somewhat serions; and the reruander had contusions and wounds of a trifling character. Fortunately there was attached to the guard's van a carriage full of railwvay officers' clothing, and this helped to break the concussion. The guard was badly shaken, and the driver of the engine (C. Ward) had his lip cut. None of the carriages were thrown off, and but little delay was caused, for as soon as theyvaa and empty carriages could be detached, and the excitement some vbat allayed, those of the pessengers who were uninjured, and all who were not hurt baly, once more took their seats, and the train proceeded to Liverpool. Mr. Robinson, the station-master, was on the spot soon afterwards, and did all in his power to provide for the sufferers in a proper manner. He will, of course, in due time investigate the cause of the accident. We believe the signalman at 'New-street station alleges that he received a message stating that the tunnel was clear, while the officer at the Crescent end states that no suac signal was transmstted by him. Between these two the blame lies. It is not attributable to the driver of the engine. The steam which filled the tunnel rendered it impossible for him to observe that there was a train ahead; aRd it appears that the outgoing train remained in the tunnel longer than usual, owing to the humid atmosphere having made the raUs slippery. On inquiry at the hospital on Thursday night, we found that Mr. Brown and Mrs. Goldstraw were going on well.-Birmitghain Daily Post. THE REBuILDING OF PA1;IS.-The Prefet of the Seine has made his annual report upon the condition of the city confided to his care for 1857, in which the details of its reconstruction occupy the most important place. We do not propose to open the question of the policy of the extensive demolitions that have taken place, but simply to cull from the statement such facts as niay be interesting to the reader. Since 152, and up to the present date, 2,971 stractures have been wholly or partially pulled down--viz., 2 524 up to the end of 1856, and 417 during the present yer,; of these 1,763 were demolished by the municipality for the improvemEct of the city, and 1,203 by the landlords of their own f-ee will. The number of new buildings finished and inbabi'ed was 5,238 from 1852 to 1856, and 1,345 in 1857, giviLg a total of 6,583; of these 3,743 were enttrely new constructons, and 2.840 structures partially rebauilt or raised. So muoh for Paris proper. In the subnrbs of St. Denis and Sceau-1i the former 1,500 houses were pullUed down, and 11,206 built up; in the latter 968 houses were demolished, and 6,185 constructed from 1852 to the present year. These different figures give a total of 5,439 houses wholly or partially pulled down, and of 23,974 houses wholly or partially rebuilt in the last seven years. Evidently this stitement would not convey a correct idea of the house accommodation for the inhabitants of Paris. The Pr6fet has taken care, therefore, to add the number of apartments or dwellings-for the reader will scarcely requireto be told that Parislans live in lodgings-to be found in the city. He states that last year there were 432,639 dweUings, of which 426,896 were occupied, and 5,743 empty. This year there are 443,315 dwe'ings. of vhich 8,560 are vacant. The floating population, wh.ch was estimnated at f0,000 in 1852, is set down at 150,000 to-day, to accommodate which there are 2,412 ready-furnished honEes or hotels, and 6,038 houses partially appropriated to this purpose. Consequently, there are 8,460 persons who let furnished lodgings or rooms now, against 5,380 in 1852. From thee figures it is estimated that an equivalent to 4,000 houses are devoted to the accommodation of travellers to Paris,-Buildingj Yews.

Your lordships are weU aware that, for reasons whioh I shaU not attempt to divine, certain parties have endeavoured most industriously to persuade the public that disagreements existed between Lord Canning and Sir Colin Campbell. It has been almost In vain that a distinct denial to these statements has been given on the part of the Government. Such denials have been made, and, I am happy to say, have been generally believed, but I shal now read to your lordships an extract from a letter from Sir Colin CampbeU himself, which wi put the matter beyond a doubt, and convince the public mind of England of the malignant intentions of those who have invented this story. It is an extract from a letter, dated October 2G, 1857, written to his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief upon the occasion of the gaUant writer quitting Calcutta to take the field at the head of his troops, with, I hope, a certain prospect of leading them to victory. (Hear, hear.) The extract from this letter to which I refer is this:- " Now that I am on the point of leaving Calcutta, I would beg, with the greatest respect to the Governor-General, to record the deep sense of the obligation I entertain towards his lordship. Our intercourse has been most cordial, intimate, and unreserved. I cannot be sufficiently thankful for his lordship's confidence and support and the kindly manner in which they have been afforded, to my great personal satisfaction. One at a distance, and unacquainted with the ordinary mode of transacting business in this country, coalJ hardly estimate the gain to the public service 'which has thus been made. But I allude principally to my own feelings of gratification." Thus, mY lords, SJr Cola CampbeU bears testimaony that Lord Canning, settiDg aside the ordinary mode of transacting military business in that country, has afforded him a support which has tended greatly to the advantage of the public service. (Hear, hear.) My lords, I thought it 'was my duty (hear, hear) to make this statement to you and to the public before Parliament was adjourned, In order that we milght set at rest for ever the calumny 'which has been circulated, that between the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief ia Iadia any disagreements bad existed. (Hear, hear.) The motion for the adjournment untUl Thursday, the 4th of February, 1868, was then agreed to, and their lordships separated.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, SATURDAY, DEC. ]2. The House met to-day at a quarter to 3 o'clock. NEW WRIT FOR BUCKIIGEAMSHIRE. On the motion of Mr. HDYTER, A new writ was ordered for the election of a member for the county of Buckingham, in the room of the Hon. C. 0. Cavendish, who has accepted the Stewardship of the Chiltern Huandreds. Mr. VILLIERS p resented a petition from Wolverhamnp. ton in favour of India reform. Lord PALMERSTON moved that the House at its rising adjourn till Thursday, the 4th of February. EVIDENCE OF MR. TWELLS BEFORE TEIE BANK COMMITTEE. Mr. SPOONER claimed the indulgence of the House while be endeavoured to do justice to a most respectable gentleman, an old and esteemed friend of his own, -who was rather unfairly dealt with last night by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; he alluded to Mr. Twells. The right hon. gentleman readfpart of Mr. Twells's evidence before the Committee on Banking, but the way in which le quoted that evidence was calculated to give a wrong impression of the views held by him. The Chanellor of the Exchequer read a long series of leading qucstions-he should rather call them misleading questionswhich had been put to Mr. Twells by himself, and their answers, but he omitted to read other questlons and answers in connexion with them, which changea the whole character of the evidence. He did not read the questions conmecutively, but omitted many interesting ones, and thus prevented the House from fully understanding the effect of the ; hole. The right hon. gentleman began by saybig that he had been led into the error of supposing that he (Mr. Spooner) was the advocate of an unlimited issue of in. convertible paper, but that he had been made sensible of his error by a statement which he made to the House that he beld no such views. He said he had been led into the error by the evidence of Mr. TweDs, whose sentiments he supposed him (Mr. Spooner) to hold. Now, he begged to say that he concurred in aU that Mr. Twells said before the committee, but not in the construction put upon it by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The right hon. gentleman asked this question- " You recommend the issue of 20,000,0001. of bank-notes not payable in gold on demand, but receivable by the Gjvernment in payment of taxes.-Yes." But the next question and answer were omitted, viz.- " Do you understand that those notes would be issued by the Bank of Eugland or by the Government 7-I think it is perfectly immaterial. I should say by the Bank of England, on account of the completeness of its machinery. In order to avoid as much as possible violating the feelings of the people with regard to that to which we have been so long accustomed, it would be merely altering the words, and inserting, instead of ' I promise to pay,' something of the sause kind as is inserted in an Exchequer Bil, 'pa7able for receipt of taxes.' It would of course be sanctioned by Government, but whether the notes were issued by the Government or by the Bank of England I think would be very immaterial." The views of Mr. Twells were that we should have two sorts of currency-one for our own inland and domestic purposes, and the other to carry on our foreign trade. (Hear, .ear.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer also put the following question:- " Of course, it would bo necessary to omit the words, ' I promise to pay,' because these notes would not, in fact, be promises to pay on demand ?-Quits so." But he omitted to put the next question, which was one of great importance- " Whatt do you conceive to be the advantage of an inconvertible note of that kind over a convertible note payable to bearer on demand 9-It would prevent a drain of bullion when it is required for foreign trade, and it would give us what is so very essential, a domestic currency which is not influenced by any foreign transactions whatever. If France or America wants a quantity of gold it ought not to interfere with our domestic currency. Our merchants and aU our trade surely should not suffer because America wants gold." Agaln, he asked- "Do you think that that currency would run the risk of ever being depreciated in value-that is to say, that inconvertible 51. -notes would not exchange for five sovereigns ?- I do not know as compared with sovereigns; that, I think, is of no consequence in the world. We want it for our internal commerce, and we want it to pay Government thLer taxes." But the next question asked, and not given by the right hen. gentleman was- "How would you determine the value of a 51.-note ?-I do not want any value beyond its passing for 51. for taxes; whatever the Government demands from me as a tax of 51." What his friend Mr. Twells meant was that he wanted nothing more than that the Government should take the 51. note In payment of taxes. He was afterwards asked his opinion as to the cause of the depreciation of the French osrigntat at the time of the Revolution, and his reply was- "What I stated a little while ago, that a Government inmay issue in excess; it is very possible, and supposing it is a corrupt Government they have the power of doing it; but such an institution as our Bank of England cannot do it, because they only issue against property, against something of equal value with their own notes. and we consider that the further value of their own notes is ecured by the sanction of a well-established Government; that the guarantee of our Governmnent, taking it as it is in England, is quite equal to 20,000,0001. of gold deposited in a vault. I should be very sorry to think otherwise of it." There was enough in that answver to explain the difficulty of his right hon, friend abont the matter, and which excited so much mirth and merriment in the House. It showed that Mr. Twells meant all bis answers to apply not to notes issued by the Bank of England, but to notes guaranteed by the Government. He hoped this statement, which he had deemed it his duty to make, would receive as vide a publicity as that wbich had been made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Twells was next asked- " Under what does the country suffer, and why under a drain of bullion ?-Because it cannot have supplied to it a sufficient circulation. The House of Commons was congratulated in the year 1811 upon the adoption of a measure for supplying the country with a ' circulating medium of undoubted credit proportioned to its wants;;' now, I take I that to secure that is the object of a sound currency. "From what is that an extract ?-That was stated on Ur. Homer's motion for the Bullion Committee. 'A circulating medium of undoubted credit, proportioned to the wants of the country,' I conceive, must embrace evertbing that can oeIrequized of a currency. "Wlhos opinion is that7-That iiS whati wanstated Ly Lord Castlereagh, and he observed upon it that this c culating medium of undoubted credib had 'for the first time solved the problem of reconciling national prosperity with a state of war; that the country had risen in manufac. tures, internal improvement, revenue, and commerce with a veloclty which had never been experienced in a year of profound peace."' The Deputy Usher of the Black Rod here entered the House, and with the usual formalities summoned the Speaker to the House of Lords to hear the Royal assent given to a Bill. The SPEAKER on his return announced that the Royal assent had been given by commission to the Bank Issaes Indemanity BilL MIr. SPOONER, resuming his statement, proceeded to read the following extracts from Mr. Twells's evidence:- "The gap whiCh is created in the circulating medium by sending buUion out to purchase corn would be fiUed up for the time by the inconvertible note till the exohange is turned, and then gold would naturally flow in ?-Yes, it would naturally flow in just as any other commodity. 11 But the bank-note, if Issued entirely by the Bank upon the Bank's own responsibility, you would still keep liable to be paid in gold; you do not want to make any change in that ?-Not at aU. "'There would be no7necessity for it ?-None whatever. " There are notes to the extent of 14,500,0001. now issued upon securities ?-Yes. " Do not they, upon the face of them, bear a promise to pay orn demand 1-Yes. "Supposing the demand was to extend to them, and to pay upon that 14,600,000L., would they be able to be paid ? -No, they would not he able to be paid; but the country is now put in such a position that they cannot demand it. "Then paper is issued which iB not capable of being paid on demuaud, hut it is done in the confidence that the country would he in such a state before that demand could be made that it 'would be utterly impossible for the country to demand it ?-Yes, quite so. "' Then it bears upon the face of it a fallacy, just as much as an inconvertible note ?-Yes, just the same. Therefore I think it would be only the fair and judicious and honest course to take that those notes should bear an impress upon them of what they were intended to be. " You therefore recommend that those notes, instead of being issued upon securities, and pretending that they are issued on gold, should bear upon the face of them that they are issued upon securities, and you would recommend that those notes, so issued upon securities, should be made a legal tender ?-Quite so. "And whether the amount should be 14,000,0001. or 20,000,0001. is a question upon which you do not give a positive opinion ?-Not at alL " But your experience has shown you that when there was a steady issue of about 20,000,0001. the trade was carried on steadily and prosperously in the country?-Yes; that is why I say 20,000,0004.; but it is quite possible that 14.000,0001. would effect a great deal; that is a matter which experience only can decide." Mr. Twells was a man of great experience and sound knowledge, and was mixed up with no particular party. He came before the committee to tell them the result of his observations, and it was not treating fairly a gentleman now nearly 50 years of age to attaok him by ridicule and joke, and to take up garbled statements of the questions put to him and the answers he had given. CHURCH-RATES.-THE CORRUPT PRACTICES PREVENTION ACT. Mr. T. DUINCO0BE wished to put two questions to the noble lord at the head of the Government. The first was whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to introduce during the present session a measure on the subject of church-rates ? The second question was one of more importance, because with regard to church-rates pesple were taking the remedy into their own hands, and there was an unwllUingness to enforce the law. The other estion related to the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act. 'Rat Bill was passed for a year and until the end of the session next thereafter. It was renewed for another year and for the session afterwards. The latter session had now arrived, and if anything should terminate the scasion abruptly corruption and bribery would be held under very precarious and slender control. (A laugh.) He wished to know whether Her Majesty's Government intended to refer the subject to a select committee, or whether they would bring in a Bill to improve that bunghng Act9 Lord PALMERSTON.-Her Majesty's Government hope to be able to lay before Parliament during the present session a measure on the subject of church-rates. Of course, I cannot make any positive engagement on the subject, because it will depend upon the state of public business. With regard to the second question put to me by my hon. friend, we stated last year that we proposed to continue the Act for another year instead of at once appointing a select committee to consider the subject, because we imagined, as the election petitions were then about to be presented, that the decisions and Investigations of the eloction committees would throw a light on the matter, and that it would be better to postpone until the prosent session the appointment of a committee to condder what alterations ought to be made in that Act. Of course, we shall carry that intention into execution, and when Parliament meets again I shall be ready to propose the appointment of a committee to consider the working of bhe Act. With regard to the contingency of an appeal to the country to which my hon. friend has alludedz we hope after what has passed in this House we shall De relieved from that necessity. (Cheers and laughter.) SEWAGE OF TiE THAMIES. Mr. WLNGFIELD wished to enter his protest against the proposal to let out the sewage of the Thames at a point between Rainham, on the Essex side, and Erith, on the opposite shore. There could be no doubt that the health of the inhabitarts of the district around this spot would suffer greatly if such a scheme were carried into effect. CHURCH-RATES. Sir J. TRELAWNY wished to remind the noble lord at the head of the Government that he had promised to brin" in a church-rate Bill last session, but had not done so. This question had given rise to great debates in that House, and it had also been referred to a committee. The matter was tberefore quite ripe for an immediate settlement. The noble lord (Palmerston) was at the head of the Liberal party in the Houde, and he ought to declare upon what principles be was going to govern the country. Let him come forward like a man, and propose to,legislate on the question of churchrates, and don't let him suppose that the couttry would be any longer " gasled" in the way it had been on that subject year after year. DISTRESS AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES. Mr. NEWDEGATE said he was unwiUing to leave the House for the recess without calling the attention of the Government, though not In any invidious spirit, to the wide-spread distress now unhappily existing among the operative classes in various parts of the country. The accounts be liad received from his own district, the statements in the public press as to the condition of other districts, and the communications made to him by members of the House, wrne such as to convince him that, although Parliament was at out to separate without having done more than sanction a ixieasure which the Government had wisely adopted for the relief of the existing commercial depression, if that distress among the operative classes should increase, and it should appear to the Government necessary to have recourse to other measuresfor itsrelief,Parliament would readily give its approval to such measures. He thought he did not mniinterpret the feelings of the House in saying that they would be prepared to support the Government in any plan they might think it necessary to propose for the relief of thsufferingclasses. Healmostbregretted that the House was about to separate for so long a period, for he did not look forwvard to any immediate relief of theexsting distress from the steps taken by Parliament during its present meeting ; and if that disbress continued wiithout any attempt to mitigate it on ine part of the Government, it might eventually begeim the people a disposition to seek other remedies which the House might have cause to lament. Sir G. GREY said it was, no doubt, stated in the Queen's Speech that there had been a great deal of local distress occasioned by the recent commercial failures, throwing as these did large numbers of the industrious population of this country for a time altogether out of employment, or seriously reducing their wages. But, notwithstanding those unfortunate occurrences, the conduct of the working classes who had suffered by tbhem had been such as to deserve the respect and sympathy of the rest of the populatiou at large. (Hear.) If the hon. gentleman (Mr. Newdegate ,in speaking of measures of legislation, referred to such as lad regard to commerce or currency, he (Sir G. Grey) could not differ from him; but he was anxious that the passage in HIer Majesty's Sneech to which he had alluded should not be inter)reted as implying the assent of the Government to the notion that the working classes were to look to Parliament for any special remedy for the local distress occasioned by the recent commerial depression. He was glad to observe that in some parts of the country that distress was rather diminishing than increasing. (Hear, hear.) It was impossible to say what might be the course of events during the next few weeks; but he trusted the conduct of the people would show that they appreciated the laws under which they lived. As it was, nothing could be more creditable than their conduot during the recent privation to which many of them had unhappily been subject. (Hear, hear.) LADY HAVELOCK. Mr. GRIFFITH, referring to the East India Company having conferred an annuity of 5001. upon Lady Neill pointed the attention of the House to the less favourable position in which Lady Havelock would be in the event of becoming a widow, and suggested to the Government that in the new arrangement about to be made with respect to the pension of Sir Henry Havelock the pension, at Sir Henry's death, should be given one half to the widow and one half to the son, with reversion to the son on the death of the widow. Such an arrangement as that would nob increase the charge to the country, and he could not doubt that it would be more agreeable to the feelings of the gallant officer himself than the present proposal. The motion for the adjournment of the House at its rising until Thursday, the 4th of February next, was then put and agreed to. JOIN\T-STOCK BANKS. Mr. HE&DLAM gave notice that on Thursday, the 11th of February, he should move for leave to bring in a Bi to abolish the distinction between joint-stock banks and other banks. THE CORPORATION OF LONDON. Sir GEORGE GREY gavo notice that on Thursday, the 4th of February, he should move for leave to bring in a Bill for the better regulation of the Corporation of the City of London. (Cheers.) BARON ROTHSCHILD. MIr. T. DUNCOMBE said he would on Tuesday, the 9th of February, move his resolution respecting Baron Roth. schild of which he had given notice. ROADS (SCOTLAND). Lord ELCHO moved for returns of the length of the roads and streets within the limits of each Parliamentary burgh throughout Scotland maintained by the town-council out , of any burgh funds or revenues belonging to them other than 'statute labour or paving board rates, levied directly for such purposes, or m8nained ont of any paving board or other rates directly levied, or by the county road trustees, or out I of any etatute labour ascsessent; together with an estimate 'in each cass of the probable yearly cost of masintaining the ssme on an averago of three years; and several ether perticular8 touching tolls, public bridges, &c. Agreed to. POOR RELIEF (SCOTILANtD). Mr. EDWARD ELLICE moved for copies of any comnmunications addressed to the Home Secretary with reference to a statement by the Board of Supervision for the Relief of the Poor in Scotland, dated the 9th of July, 1857. Agreed to. TEIE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Mr. WYLD aeked the Fkrst Lord of the Tre&sury if upon the reassembling of Parliament it was the intention of Her Majesty's Ministers to propose any alteration in the present government of our Indian empire? Siir G. GREY said his noble friend (Lord Palmerston), who was not at that moment in his place, had already stated that on the reassembling of Parliament he would explain the intentions of the Government on that subject. THE STEAAISHIIP AIUSTRIA. Colonel SYKES, in moviug for a copy of the reports of the East India Company's surveyors on the screw steamship Austria, upon which sbe was engaged for the conveyance of troops to India, complained of the misrepresentations whioh bad been made respecting that vesseL IHe said she was a nvew vessel of 2,385 tons, and built and fitted out at Greenock. Her engines were made by Messrsm Caird and Co., of that place. men of high repute in their profession. The vessel bad a British register, and her owner was a naturalized British subject. Before being taken up as a trans. port to India she was surveyed by the Et India Company's engineer, as were her engines by the amsistant to the chief engineer at Woolwich Dockyard, and the reports which those gentlemen maide of her were entirely satisfactory. The troop embarked at Cork, and thence the vessel sailed on the 5th of October. When in the Bay of Biscay she encountered one of those storms so common there. She waS struck by a sea which swept her decks, broke down and carried away her bulwarks fore and aft, and compelled her to put back to Plymouth for repairs. On examination there her engines were found to be unharmed, and after the ship hall undergone the necessary repairs she again proceeded on her voyage. She eoperienced another storm, however, and unfortunately in the midst of it a part of her engines gave way. The result was that the piston of the enone went through the bottom of the cylinder, and the vessel thus be. coring perfectly helpless wan towed back to Plymrouth a second time. It had been stated that the authorities at the Indwa.house ordered that a spar deck should be added to the vesselforthetincreased accommodation of the troops. The very reverse of that was the case. That propositlon emanated from the owners of the shilp, but the Compan s surveyors refused their permission, and happily so. for the sea that first struck the vessel in the Bay of Blscay would Probably have swept into the sea the whole 200 or 300 soldiern who wouldhave occupied that temporary spardeck. (Elear. )He thought whenathe House was in possession of the returns for whichhe was ahoutto move, itwoald see that not a shadowof blame was attributable to the India-house in the matter. This was scarcely the occasion, or he should certainly have offered some severe comment upon the loose manner in which subjects were often investigated before they were publicly discussed. The hon. member concluded by moving for the reports already alluded to. Sir WILLIAM FRASER said, having had an opportu nity of going on board the vessel in question on her first return to Plymouth, after sbe had been nearly wrecked in the Bay of Biscay, he wished to state briefly to the House what he observed on that occasion. He did not profess to hava any great knowledge of shipbuilding, but no one could have seen the state of the vessel without being convinced that she was not at all a ship in which to trust one of Her Majestys regimaents on a long voyage to India. (Rear, hear.) There was hardly a door or panel in the ship that was not cracked or destroyed. There were no bulwarks whatever on the upper deck, and of the light iron railing used as asubstitute for bulwarks two-thirds had been washed away. Four out of the slx boats on her deck had also been washed away (hear, hear), and the vessel had been as nearly wrecked as could be with all her troops and crew. Indeed, one of the men of the 94th Regimeat was washed overboard. The gallant colonel hai not stated the number of the orew and engineers on boarl the ship. and he (Sir W. Fraser) would endeavour to supply the deficiency. The number of the crew of this vessel of 2.300 tons, which had on board one of the finest regiments in Her Majesty's service, was 18; the number of engineers, stokers, and other persons employed in working the engines was 22; and out of the whole of those 40 men onlv three could speak the English language. (Hear, hear.) He was bhound to say that the captain seemed to be a most Intelligent man, and to have acted with the greatest intrepidity during those trying emergencies. He (Sir W. Fraser) was told that for 48 hours he never left the deck (hear, hear), and that it was mainly owing to his conspicuous energy and prowesq that the vessel was able to reach Plymouth, There was a etory circulating in Plymouth when he (Sir W, Fraser) was there, though he would not vouch for the accuracy of it, that during the storm in the Bay of Biscay the greater part of the men employed in the engineroom declared that it was no use working any longes, because they saw no chance of saving the vessel, upon which the first engineer, procuring his pistols, said. "The first man that goes up that ladder," meaning the ladder leading from the englne-room to the deok, " I will blow his brains out." It was owing. it was said, to that circumstauce and to the energy of the captain that the vessel was brought back to Plymouth. He did not know much of shipbuilding, but he did not think a regiment could have been conveyed to India in snch a vesseL (Hear, hear.) Mr. AYRTON said a great deal of dissatisfaction was expressed last session at the manner in which the East India Company hired transports, and he w^as then Induced to move for a return on the subject, hut that return had not yet been laid on the tabe, which was much to be regretted, as It was onlyinthatwaythatthe House could form a just opinion on the subject. The motion of Colonel Sn;zs was then agreed to. PROPERTY RETURNS. On the motion of Mr. J. B. Sanrn, returns were ordered of the value of property rated for property-tax in each county and Parliamentary borough; the population of each county and borough, and the number of memubers returned by each, &c.; also, a return for the year 1857, showing in columns the number of houses, shops, warehouses, and other buildings in each borough in the united kingdom of the yearly rent or value of 101. and upwards; the number of Parliamentary voters in each, the number of members of Parliament returned by each ; the number of houses, shops, warehouses, and other buUdings of the yearly rent or valne of 51. and under 101.. the number at 4Z. and under 5Z., the number at 31. and under 41., and the number under 31.; also, the number of houses, shops, warehouses, and other buUdings in each borough charged with poor-rates, and the number not so charged, together with the population of each borough according to the census of 1851. INTTOXICATION IN SCOTLA.ND. Mr. DUNLOP moved for and obtzined an order for returns of the number of drunken cases taken up by the police in Scotland, in boroughs having a population exceeding 5,000, during the last six years. LIGHTHOUSE AT GODREVY. Mr. A. SMITH moved for copies of communications that had passed between the Board of Trade and the Trinity House relative to the erection of a lighthouse at Godrevy, in St. Ives Bay. Mr. LOWE objected to the return as moved for, because it did not contain the whole correspondence that had tabea place, but would not object to the motion If the entire correspondence was included. Mr. A. SMITH amended his motion accordingly, and the return was ordered. In answer to Mr. I. BuTT, Sir C. WOOD was understood to say that the Admiralty was about to issue orders for sailing vessels connected with the Royal Navy carrying red and white lights on each side of the vesseL In reply to Mr. HUDsoy, The right hon. baronet said he had no knowledge of the manner in which the Austria tranusport was manned. The House adjourned at 20 minutes past 4 o'clock. PAIRS ON MR. DISRALTS AYERNI)MEI'r' Mr. Rouritt, M.P. for Lamnbeth, was prevenited from being in the division of Friday by reason of the death of his sister, whose name appears in our obituary of this day.

There were 33 cadets brought forward. Of thls number 10 were reported by the public examiner to be qualified for the Enineers viz. - The report of the public examiner and inspector of studies having been read by Mr. Cochrane, the Chairman of the East India Company, who presided at the ceremony, distributed tho prizes as follows:- 4TU TEzRL Lewis Conway Gordon.-The S3word, the Pollock MeWi, lot Nathe- natUca, les ForUtifoation. lat MiitarY SurveYing, 2d Civi Drawing, and lUndustauL JoaeDhL.

After the distribution of the prizes and thanking in the warmest terms the various professors and offloials of the colege for their labours and the results they had achieved since they last met the CHAIBRMAN proceeded :--Gonlemen, -I have the highest satisfaction in addresslng you at o the of a term dug which the general conduct of the cadets is reported to have been exemplary, and the studies of the college to have been prosecuted with more than ordinary diligence and success. I am happy to observe that 10 gentlemen have assed for the Engineers, one of whom (Mr. Seton) has obalned this honourable distinction in bis third term * and he ap;pears as sixth on the list. But while I notice this effect o the abrogation of the rule tiU recently in force, I must not neglect to place on record, to the hlgh honour of gentlemen cadets Conwvay, Gordon, and Brandreth, that if the rtle to which I refer had been esoinded before the Midsummer examination tho.e gentlenmen, now virst and second on the list, would Lave won for themselves the unprecedented distinction of occupying the same positions at the hesd of a term as those who entered the college six months before them. Gentlemen, since we last met in this place a fearful storm has bursb upon British India. Almost the whole army of the Presidency of Bengal-an army about equal in numbers to the armies of the two other presidencies combined-has cast off its allegiance to the Government it was bound to serve, and has added, in too many instances, to the crime of mutiny the murder of its officers, of women, and children, and other nameless atrocities. Happily, the army of Madras has stood stanch. With partial exceptions the army of Bombay has also been faithful, Bat almost every regimaent of the great native army of Bengal has either mutinied or been disarmed. This Is a great calamity. The staff upon which we have leaned with so much confidence for a century has saddenly broken in onr hands like a rotten reed, and the subsequent contest with the mutineers has been a desperate one. Their numbers have been enormons in proportion to the troops which the Government has been able to array againt them. We had placed arms in the hands of the Sepoys and taught them only too well how to use them. The result has been a deadly struggle-now, I trust, drawing speedily to a closecheckered by terrible disasters such as the massacre at Cawnpore, and attended generally (owing to the disparity of numbers) by a lamentable sacrifice of invaluable lives, Bnt by the blessing of God the result has been in every case the trinumph of the British arms. (Cheers.) This is not the tiu e or place to enter further upon this subject ; but I cannot allow the opportunity to escape for expressing, in the warmest language, the heartfelt atltude and admiration with which the body which I have the honour to represent regard the heroic endurance of fatigue and hard. ship, of climate and disease, no less than the undaunted valour in every conflict, which has been displayed by our gallant soldiers of every rank from the general to the private. It has been by the unparalleled exercise of these virtues that, under Providence, we have come victors lout of a contest so unequal. Honour to the brave who havefallenhonour to the brave who survive-but especially honour, in this place, to those of our heroes who learnt at this college their first lessons of military science, and imbibed at tte same time the high spirit of British soldiers. Gentlemen, I hold in my hand a brilliant list of your predecessors who have distinguished themselves most remarkably where all have done so well in this terrible contest. First on the roll is Sir Henry Lawrence whose loss at such a juncture every Englishman must feei to bea great national calamity -a statesman as well as a soldier, a chivalrous gentleman as well as an earnest Christian. (Cheers.) Next is Sir Archdale Wilson-I mention him second, but second to none stands Sir Archdale Wilson, the conqueror of Delhi. The storming of that great city and its eventual capture, after no less than six days of terrible street-fighting, against enemies far superior in number and fully prepared, must be held, on all hands, to be an achievement worthy to be recorded on the brightest page of the annals of British warfare. (Loud cheers.) Then follows a crowd of names-officers of the Engineers and Artillery-too many of whom, alas ! have fallen in the struggle-Baird Smith, Tombs, Fagan, Vincent Byre, D'Oyly (who, seated on a tumbril, continued to command his guns after he had been mortally wounded), Salkeld and Home (the gallant yonths who blew open the Cashmere-gate); and last, not least, the undaunted Willoughby, who defended to the last moment the arsenal at Delhi, and then fired the train to explode it. (Cheers.) Gentlemen, let these noble examples of valour and devotion bo duty stimulate you to follow in the steps of those who have preceded you in thiS institution. Braver or more skilful officers, better soldiers in every branch of the army than Addiscombe has reared for India, the world has never seen. You will need to exert yourselves to maintain at its present height the reputation of the military college of the East India Company. I must turn from this stirring theme to subjects affecting your present positions and duties. You, gentlpmen, who have been selected for the Engineers, wiUl proceed to prosecute your studies at Chatham. Permit me to offer you a few words of kindly advice, though I am sure that his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury will address you with more effect on the subject to which I am now about to allude. You will pass to-day from the strict discipline of this college. At Chatham, comparatively free agents, you wUl be exposed to many now temptations, to Idleness and expense, at least, if not to still geater dangers. UDon these rocks some few have unhappily%made shipwreck I pray you, therefore, to remember all that is at stake. Bear in mind that the favourable report of the distinguished officer who will superintend your studies is essential to your commission and your rank. Remember, too, how anxiously your arents and friends wi watch your career, and how intrma bly their happiness is bound up in the issue of your probation at Chatham. To those gentlemen of the Artillery and Infantry about to proceed to India I will say a few words as to the native troops they wlli have under their orders. How far it will be thought desirable ever again to have native artillerymen I do not know, but native soldiers for the infantry we must have, and you, gentlemen, must learn to govern them in such a way as will render them true and faithful servants. This for a time wil be a task full of difficulty, especiaUy to those among you who wil go to Bengal. But you must remember that among the native troops the remarkable fidelity of the Sikhs and Ghoorkas bas teen shown. I especially recommend to you the study of the native languages, and the study and proper appreciation of the characters of the men you will have aunder you. You wiiU not neglect these for your own sakes. The warning we have receivedhas been an awful one, and I am sure that it will not be lost upon the officers of India. The Chairman then concluded, amid loud cheers, by cordiaUy recommending the cadets to regularly keep up their correspondence from India with their relatives at homne, and earnestly wishing them success in the high and honourable career which lay before them. The Archbishop of C,%srTzRsU1RY said, he could not refuse to coomply with the request which had been made to him by his hon. friend, and, though he could add nothing to the forcible remarks which he had made or the friendlyadvlce he had given, yet he could not losethe opportunity of addressing a few words to them, even though what he had to say, especially with regard to India, came with less weight from him than from the experienced Chairman of the East India Company. Many of his young hearers would soon proceed to India, where they would arrive at a most important crisis-at a time when the great superiority of the European character had been shown in a manner which none could have foreseen or even believed possible a few months since. It had been shown that a small number of Europeans, less than 20,000 he believed, had been able to reconquer one-half the East, and overawe the remainder. They would go there at a time when the European name, raised, as it would be raised, must be most carefully maintained, and he could not help thinking that the attention of the natives would be more especiaUy attracted to that cause and to that religion to which this supremacy was entirely owing. His Grace then proceeded to cite the example of a British resident at Gwalior, whose unfeigned piety and disinterestedness had shaken even the fanaticism of a&high caste rajah, and had led him to exclaim that Christianity was indeed the secret of the moral power and greatness of the English, and that it was to that they were indebted for their superiority of character and for the power which enabled them to conquer and rule the people of the East. The most rev. speaker continued,-Therc were two ways in which his youthful hearers could profess their religion-by precept and by example. The former might not be so much in their immediate line of duty, though aU should be prepared to give a reason for the faith which they professed. He trusted that the importalce of their example might be always present in their minds in that foreign land to which their duty led them, but in which there were, alas ! but too many temptations to lead them to forget beth their duties here and hereafter, He earnestly hoped and prayed that their future careers might be such as would cause their names to be as warmly remembered In those walls as the names of those gaUent men whose fame and deeds had been so ably commemorated by their chairman. The cadets then having dined, the chairman and visitors proceeded to the model-room and the departments allottod to military and civil drawing. In the former was a beautifully executed model of the fortifications of Delhi on a much reduced scale. It was most admirably finished, and the immense strength and defensive value of Its various parts were duly explained. A small charge of powder was spraung with a voltaic battery wire under the Cashmere gate to show the manner in which it had been effected and the resuits to which such a step must lead. The followinigprizes were awarded to the military and civil drawing classes:- {mn TRms. 1st Prlze.-hr. sBandreth. Sd Prizm-Ur.Maut, My. Gordon, hIr. Stewart. &r. Seton, Mr Carter, Mr. Blackwood, r.

The whole of the drawings were highly praiseworthy, forming an exhibition of a very pleasing character. Mr. J. Brandreth, sub-officer, produced some capital specimens in photography, for which he was presented with a prize, being the first gained in that department, The examination concluded with the usual drill parade of the cadets, in which their general profiCiency in drill and admirab]e discipline were displayed to most striking advantage.

ZELECTION INTZLLIGENCZ. ASETO)N- '"ho poll commenoed On Saturday morning and resulted in favour of the Right Hon. Thomas hliler Gibson. At the end of the first hour Mr. Gibson was 125 %-he.d of his antagonist, and this majority was never reduced througtoug the day, although Mr. Mason's friends struggled hard to the last, and succeeded in securing nearly every vote from the publicus and beersellers on the register. The hourly return% were as follows:- Gibson. Mason. 9 o'clock ... ... ... 223 98 10 o'clock ... ... ... 369 189 11 o'clock ... ... ... 440 265 12 o'clock ... .. ... 478 320 1 o'clock .... .. ... 492 339 2 o'clock ... ... ... 512 378 3 o'clock ... ... ... 515 382 4 o'clock ... ... ... 522 390 Majority ... ... 132. At the close of the poll Mr. Gibson's friends had a surplus of 80 pledged voters unpolled, who, it was understood, would h*ve come forward had there been pressing ocosaion for their votes, but whose private interests rendered It otherwise undeirable they should poll. SCARBOROUGH. The election of a member of Parliament for this borougb in the place of Lord Mulgrave, who has been appointed Governor of Nova Scotia, took place on Saturday last. The huatings were erected in front of the Town Hall, aud there, was a large assemblage of electors. Captain DonLsw nominated J. Dent Dent, Bag., as a fit; and proper person to represent the borough. Mr. NIGomT seconded the proposition. Mr. HART submitted the name of George John Cayley, Esq., whose nomination was supported by Mr. HODSON. There being no other candidate, Mr. DE ST first addressed the electors, but was very coolly recelved. Having defended himself from any imputation of presumption in offering himself as a candidate, he ob. served that he was proud to be called a Liberal, and to say that he was prepared to go for all safe and sound measares of reform. The question of the extension of the suffrage was not a very easy one upon which to give pledges; buthe did not think that bricks and mortar were the truest auall fications for the possesslon of the electoral francse. (Hear, hear.) Prudence, industry, and intelligeno were important considerations, which, no doubt, would he re. garded in future measures of reform. With regard to the ballot he was not prepared to vote for it, though he did not say h would deline to support a Reform Bill which included it. He had made as far as he could a personal canvass of the town, and, though he did not accord with the custol of canvassing, he did not feel justified in being the first tc break throngh It (" Oh, oh.") He would vote for the ad mission of tee Jews, and would not be a party to disturbing the settlement made about the MaynoAth Grant. Though a member of the established church, he wished to see the obnoxious impost of church-rates abolisbed, for the church. rates in a pecuniary point were not worth the fighting and heartburningthey caused, and the sooner they were aborished the better. He was a strong advocatefor education, though not separated from religious instruction; and with regard to religious endowments, while he thought those in England might be considered as private property, it was a great in. justice to tax the people of this country for the support of religion in the colonies. India was the great, the absorbing topic of the day. They had all heard with horror of the bbararities which a heathen peoplehad inflicted upon women and children, and upon the noblest soldiers, and they all hoped that stern and severe would be the punishment of the mutineers. Warm and vigorous should be our gratitude tc those brave men who had won our battles, and to the natives who had been trtae to their cause, and who deserved a worthy reward. (Hear.) The Government of India must be remodelled, and the present cumbrous system of double government superseded by the direct control of the Legisla. ture. Though an advocate for economy in the public. service, he was opposed to a reduction of the army and navy, and considered that the Militia should be maintained as a reserve for the former service. He defended himself from the accusation that he was merely a Government "hack-" he was noslavish supporter of Lord Palmerston, though he would sapport the present Government so long as they conducted the, affairs of the nation as they had hitherto done. He believed that Lord Palmerston had the sympathy of the country, and he knew no man -who was so well prepared to carry out the wishes of the people. (Applause). Mr. CAYLEY commenced his address by replying to the remarks made by Mr. Dent's proposer, as to the powerful imagination he Mr. Cayley) must possess if he hoped to be returned. HIs hon. opponent had very ireely expresaed. himself as a LIberaL He had said he did not approve of canvassing, but had sffil gone from door to door. Yet ho was a reformer. (Laughter.) He had not asked a single person for his vote, and all who sapported him must do it independently. With respect to improvement, they might go at too great a speed. He liked a safe travelling pace; wvherever there was a grievance he would seek to remedy it, and wherever there was a false principle he should like toknock it on tho head. But before he leaped he must and would look. (Hear.) He was not a supporter of the ballot, for he believed it would be something like applying a quack medicine, which would perhaps cure the part affected, bat leave behind It a constitutional disease. Voting by bsUot would degrade the franchise. The best way, he believed, to make the suffrage wholesome was to strike at the high, by removing every possible means of iutimi. dation, (Hear, hear.) After expressing his views on the monetary question, he reverted to the Indian mutiny. The terrible outrages which had been committed were almost too solemn a subject to speak upon there. It; was unnecessary to excite in their minds any feeling of indignation at the unchristian, un-English, inhuman conduct of the rebellious Sepoys, and the important question waswhat could they do to prevent such a calamity occurring again ? (Hear.) He believed the people liked Lord Palmerston, because he was a clever nan of the world. He con, sidered him a man of the world, a good old fellow, and rather a shifty old chap. (Laughter.) He did not promise to sup. port Lord Palmerstou as his hon. opponent did, though be should give the Premier an independent support in all matters for the publiac good. (Hear.) If they returned him it must be freely; and he appealed to his friends to support him at the poll. (Ap lause.) The MAYTOR (Mr. EI Spurr) then took a show of hands, which was most decidedly in favour of Mr. Cayley. Captain Darley demanded a poll for Mr. Dent, which was fixed to be taken on Monday (this day). MIr. CAntY proposed, and MIr. Dr?X seconded, a vote of thanks to the Mayor for his impartiality, and, ithaving beenb carried byacclamation, the nomination proceedings were brought to a conclusion. BUCKIN-GHAUSEEIRE. The Hon. C. C. Cavendish having announced his retirament from the representation of this county in consequence of his elevation to the peerage as Baron Latimer, a vacancy has occurred, and there are already two candidates in the field, hlr. W. G. Cvendish, the son of the present member, in the Whig interest, and Captain C. J. B. Hamilton, who wvas formerly member of the borough of Aylesbury, in the Conservative cause. Mr. Cavendish s address announces his intention of giving an energetic support to Lordealmerston's Government, and a requisition numerously signed has boen 'presented to Captain Hamilton, who has signified his intention of coing forward. NORTH NORTHAMPTONSHIBE. The nomination of a successor to fill the vacancy in the repreeentation of the Northern Division, occasioned by the lamented death of Mr. Augustus Stafford, took place on Friday morning at Kettering. Mr. George Ward Hunt, the Conservative candidate, was escorted into the tov;n by a body of farmers, and at 10 o'clock, the EIigh Sheriff having taken his place uponthe hustings, Mr. Hunt repaired thither, accompanied by the Hon. F. NY. C. Villiers, Sir C. L-ham, and General Arbuthnot. Part of the hustings was occupiei in force by the Liberals, and Mr. Fitzpatrick Vernon was subsequently proposed in opposition to Mr. Hunt, although he had not then issued any address. The show of hands, however, wFas greatly in favour of the Liberal candidate, and a poll was demanded on behalf of Mr. Hunt, which will openthis (Monday) morning. The Libcerals say they will poll to the last man, but It is admitted that the registry is not at present very favourable to their cause. Fn

MONRY-MABKBTandCITYINTBLLIGRNAB. Saturday Evening. The English funds opened steadily this morning at the improved prices of yelterday, but there was isubsequently a disposition on the part of the speculators to effect realizations, and the market closed at a alight decline. The extent of general business was lunmportant. Consols for the opening were frst quoted 911 to 92 ex div., and they left off at '91g to ~. Bank Stock closed at 217 to 219; Reduced, 91 * to i; New Three per Cents., 91 atoI ; India Bonds, 35a. to 25s. discount; and Exchequerbills, 4s discount to par. The demand for discount at fhe Bank continues active, but not to such a degree as to prevent a Eteady recovery in its resources. In the foreiga stock-market Russian and Dutch were aiat from sales on foreign account. Buenos Ayres were quoted considerably higher on the receipt of favourable advices with regard to the Tecent arrangement of the debt. Peruvian Fourand-a-Half per Cents. were negotiated at 75 for the account; Mexican, for the acCount, 189 and J ; Russian Five per Cents., 104; Spanish New Deferred, 25i ; Turkish Six per Cents., 92 ; for the account, 93k, i, and 92ki; ditto, Four per Cents. Guaranteed, 99, ; for the account, 100 and 99k; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 95k. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 66f. 5Oc. for money and 66f. 70c. for the end of the month, sho wing a further advance of a quarter per cent. About 12,0001. of gold, chiefly RuBsian, was taken to the Bank to-day. A private telegram dated Hamburg this day 2.25 p.m. states that the feeling there is much more favourable, and that it is hoped the crisis is at an end. The remarkable feature of the currency debase which terminated last evening was the absence of the usual attempts to distiact the House with a multitude of nostrums. At former periods nearly every speaker against the Bank Act has had a plan of his own to insure at all times a "sufficient" supply of the circulating medium, and, while no two of them could ever agree except in denouncing the existing law, they were a most formidAble and distracting body, since with a hundred panaceas to demolish, before you had got to the end of the list the first was sure to be again as fresh as ever. All this seems to have been extinguished by the exposures before the committee of last session, and even Mr. Spooner, although in a mystical or non-natural sense, has advanced so far as to wish to repudiate any connexion with the inconvertibles. At least two-thirds of the House appear to have given their adhesion to the theory of the Act of 1844, while the remaining third have for the most part abandoned their Independent and incongruous devices, and have united on a common doctrine, which happily can be understood and handled. This doctrine simply is, that although the State may compel persons to take bank-notes as a legal tender for gold, they shculd not enforce anyprecautions to insurethat there shall always be a supply of gold to meet them; that, in fact, it Is not necessary to take any such precautions, since, if the law declares that a bank which issues promissory notes payable in gold on demand shall always be held bound to fulfil such promise, it is quite impossible it can ever fail to do 5o. Considering the vast experience acquired by most persons before middle life of the difference between a promise and its performance, the majority of mankind will perhaps be rather startled at this view; but, as they have lately been told that an article whose worth depends solely on its scarcity is not in the slightest degree depreciated in value by any additional quantity that may be produced-that, in fact, diamonds would be as costly as ever if tbey were as abundant as acorns-it may perhaps not have taken them by surprise. The argument is, that as the amouut of money which the public require for their daily transactions is regulated by the natural courseof trade, no one will take any more than he wants, and that if a bank attempts to force out a supply of notes in excess of the legitimate demaud they will forthwith be returned to it, It is also urged that if trade should be carried to such an unhealthy polnt as to lead to a drain of bullion, the necessary contraction will steadily be effected by the notes in circulation being sent in for gold until the adverse condition shall have been corrected. How does this argument jus. tify the doctrine founded upon it ? The problem can be worked in a few lines. Suppose the Bank oF England possessed of authority to issue notes at its own discretion, and that it were to resolve to support " the enterprise of the country" on a scale commensurate with the views of the authorities at Liverpool, Sunderland, Glasgow, and elsewhere who have the broadest ideas of its functions. It discounts all the bIlls brought to it, makes advances on stock, railway shares, ships, iron works, and coal mines, and, ini short, opens its purse to all comers. Supposing five millions to be thus issued in the course of a week, what would become of them ? The gentleman who bad just got a loan of 100,0001. on some worthles3 ships would of course pay the sum into his bankers. That firm would pay it to their own credit with the Baiik of England, whence they would henceforth at any time have the power of demanding it in gold. But if the foreign exchanges at this time were favourable they would not demand gold. In a little while, however, the fortunate borrower of the 100,0001. would begin to think of turning his money to account. He would order goods from abroad, or buy foreign stocks, or help to get up new companues at home that would employ labourers who would consume foreign produce and create nothing that could be exported in return, and in a short time anulmmense demand would sprlng up for specle to be sent out of the country. The noteholders then, but not till then, would begin to take their paper to the Bank for gold, the depositors would draw out their deposits in notes and immediately present these also for cash, the stock would be rapidly reduced, even persons who had no foreign payments to make would take fright and resolve to get gold while there was any left, and at length it would be announced that there was no more to be had. A system that would admit of these results is what is now contended for by those who oppose Sir Robert Peel's Act, and for whom a circulation precisely analogous to one of pure gold is not good enough. It is the same as that which prevailed before the passing of that Act, and for which a remedy was universaUy demanded. It had led the i3ank of England on one occasion to a suspension of specie payments, and had at a later perlod nearly produced a like event, when a loan of specie was found necessary from the Bank of France. For the aecond time within 20 years It has created similar consequences in America, having, in fact, from its operation in that country been the proximate cause of aU the disasters just experienced here and throughout the continent of Europe. And the present moment is selected for recommending the British Legislature to return to it. " I hold,' said Mr. Disraeli last evening, " that by ample, complete, and Irrefutable evidence three things are established-that a bank-note convertible at par cannot be depreciated; that it is impossible for any iser of any bank-notes convertible at par to forcoe them Into circulation; and that prices cannot be affected by a bank-note circulation under such conditions further th an they would be affected by an equal amount of metallic currency." In Thee Tinmes of yesterday the failure was announced of an old, torn-out cOnCern, called the Worcester Bank, of Farley, Lavender, and Co. It had a small circula tion of notes, all of which purport to be convertible at par. The holders, however, find the doors of the establishment closed, and are in much disquietude of mind. It would be a great charity to convince them by ample, complete,Fand irrefutable evidence that their property has not become depreciated. Perhaps the only way to do so wouldbe by buyingthe notes of them at the rate of 20s.in the pound. Will Mr. Disraeli, or any of the professors of the school he has joined, seize the opportunity to give a tangible iUustration of the sincerity of their convictions ? The City of Glasgow Bank have obtained the fall awsistance necessary to enable them to re-open, and will therefore not have to apply to the Bank of England. The Western Bank have formally notified that they cannot resume business. Me-srs. Heine, Semon, and Co., whose failure for 700,0001. was announced yesterday, have to-day received some remittances which, had they arrived earlier, might, it is said, possibly have averted the necessity for suspension. With regard to Messrs. Montoya, Saenz, and Co., whose stoppage also occurred yesterday, the statement is confirmed that the liabilities in this country are very small, the house in London being merely a branch of their large establishment at Bogota, New Granada, where arrangemeuts have been made to meet ultimately every liability. The firm in Bogota contracted the original Columbian loan, and has existed since 1825. Its mercantile operations both in that country and London were very considerable until 1851, when the failure of their brokers, S. Rucker and Sons, involved them in losses which finally amounted to nearly 400,0001. Since that event it has been considered the most honourable courseto liquidate gradually and avoid aU further risks, the Bogota house possessing estates and properties sufficient, if realized with care, to'pay every one in full. The house was considered the first firm in New Granada, and could have obtained assistance, but they preferred the safer course, and their creditors have entirely approved their proceedings. The bills now about to be returned from London to New Granada will be provided for there under the general arrangements for the mass of Iliabilities, and confidence is expressed that not a sinigle creditor will sustain loss. In the case of Messrs. Wienholt, Wehner, and Co., another of the houses who stopped yesterday for 350,0001., it is affirmed that, although owing to the continental failures the value of the assets cannot be accurately estimated, they were recently ample, and may still yield a satisfactory return. Letters from Marseilles mention the failure of Ralli and Apaleyra, in the corn trade, for 280,000?. Within the last few days the failure has occurred of Messrs R. and M. Toldorph and Co., Swedish merchants in London, but the amount of their liabilities has not transpired. Hamburg advices contradict the failure recently reported of M. Gebruder Kalkmann. The house have notified their readiness to pay all acceptances in advance up to the 1Gth inst. In relation to the stoppage of Messrs. Draper, Pietroni, and Co., which took place last month, the followring has been received from theTransatlantic Steam Company, with whom the firm seem to have a disputed account, each party, as is usual in such cases, being positive that the other is altogether in the wrong:- " London, Dec. 12. " Sir.-In your publication of the 14th of November you inserted a circular of Messra. Draper, Pietroni, and Co., announcing their suspension. The directors of the Transatlantic Steam Navigation Companyof Genoafeel calledupon to declare that what isstated byMessrs. Draper, Pietroni, and Co., as regards their connexion with the company, is ground. less, an,d further, that this connexion cannot posibly have caused the suspension of thaet firm. "Iam, &c., ' A. DANERI, " &ttorney for the Transatlantic Company, Genoa." The railway intelligence of the week is of little importance. At a meeting of the Bombay, B3aroda, and Central India the sanction of the East Tndia Company was announced for the exttension of the line from Surat to its natural point-Bombay, thus securing the great object originally contemplated, a cheap and constant communication between the rich cotton districts and the coast. A million of additional capital is required, and will be raised at a favourable opportunity. The first section of the line is to be opened about the middle of next year. The desirableness is intimated of obtaining a further extension to Indore, with the ultimate view of opening on to Delhi or Agra. The amalgamation of the Blackburn with the East Lancashire and Lancashire and Yorkshire has been ap|provec at meetings of the several companies. The first so l of the Mid-Sussex line was cut on Monday. The competition of the North British and Caledonian for the new EIawick and Carlisle branch is being actively carried on. Mr. G. Miller, the managing director of the Royal Swedish, has reported that since his appointment in August, 1856, he has effected a saving of 2,0001. a-year besides adiusting the debts of the company. At the time of bis taking office they amounted to 15,0001., and many being long overdue the credit of the concern was greatly lowered, but they are now being gradually paid off. The traffic has proceeded pretty steadily and will be more productive when the arrangement contemplated with the Nora Company comes into operation. The proposition for the sale of the property to the Government is at present in abeyance, the price asked being considered too high. A meeting of shareholders to-day have authorized the board to continue the negotiations and to accopt any offer that may appear to them reasonable. The proprietors of the London! and South-Western have approved the application for power to conclude the arrangements entered into with the Wimbledon and Epsom and Salisbury and Yeovil Companies, to purchase land for the enlargement of stations, &c. Considerable discussion arose upon a proposed line to meet the new Exeter and Exmouth junction at Topsham, the necessity of avoiding costly Parliamontary contests with the Great Western beinstrongly urged. It was stated that the cost Will he only 50,0001., and the traffic is estimated at 1,4001. per mile. The recommendations of the Board were ultimately approved, by a majority of 20 to 18. Mr. Ellis has resigned the chairmanship of the Midland, but retains a seat at the Board as director. The Journal de Frankfort states that the railway between Lyons and Geneva will be completed thronghout in the course of next month. The liquidators of the Liverpool Borough Bank have made a call of 51. per share. The Ariel, from New York, has brought 43001. The principal uotations by this packet are-Erie, 15; Reading, 51; wewYork Central, 73;: Illinois Central, 9O; the Bonds, 86,; Panama, 861 ;Michigan Central, 54; and Micbigan Southern, 17k. The annexed information regarding the mining business of the week is condensed from the Mining Journal:- "'The vweek has been dull, and the amount of business limited. Until after Christmas there will probably not be much Jmprovement. At Alfred Consols meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of adventurers of 1,6431.; a dividend of 1,0241.

RAILWAY AND MINING SHARES. Saturday Evening. The railway-market was rather depressed in rhe early part of the day, but recovered towards the c10se.

Indian were again in increased demand, especially Madras; while a further reduction occurred in Grand Trunk of Canada. French share3 improved, except Eastern of France. American securities were little dealt in, and show no signs of recovery from the present depression. In Canada Government Bonds the late advance was fally maintained. No important variation took place in mines. Joint-stock banks were rather flatter. The transactions in misce1laneous securities were limited, and generaUy at former prices. ORDISARY SHARES AND RTOrnf
STATE OF TRADE. kMANCHESTER, DEC. 12. There is no new feature to report in the yarn and cloth market. Very few sales have been made this morning, and the entire business done during the week has fallen short of any previous week's sales, perhaps,lduring the present crisis. Manufacturers say they do not reeollect a more thorough stagnation of trade, for, though on an average the entire production of the district does not exceed one-half the quantity usuaUy produced, stocks are rapidly accumulating. No amount of concesslon in price-and In some cases offers are made at extraordinarily low rates-seems to induce purchases, money being locked up, and shippers having no nmeans of taking advantage of the opportunities for invest. ment offering. very general surprise has been felt at the small business done for India since the last mail, considering how encouraging were commereal advices by it ; bat there is no doubt that the difficulty in discounting the paper drawn against shipments for that trade Is the main cause, and there is little hope of resumption of business in any direction until money is cheaper. B[RMINGHAM, DEc. 12. The South Staffordshire iron trade is now greatly de. pressed, and the suspension, failure, or reduction of time of many of the large workss of the district creates considerable distress in the neighbourhood. The re-opening of the Wolve-hampton and Staffordshire Bank on Tuesday for the payment of Its notes tended to re-establish corfidence; but the subsequent failare of more than one firm of standing casb a still deeper gloom over the neighbourhood thau has hitherto prevailed. We have already announced the failure of Messrs. Riley and Son, Messrs. Sony Brothers, Messrs. Fletcher and Rose, and to these are now to be added Messrs. Pemberton, of Deepfields, Messrs. Pearson an-d Kendrick, of Wolverhampton, Messrs. Gregory, of Spon-lane, and Messrs. Wright and North, of Wolverhampton. There appears to be little doubt that these disasters winl precipitate others; but the general opnion is that the effect of the present explosion will be ultimately beneficial to the iron trade of the distriet. As vet, however, although prices of best descriptions of manufactured iron have a decided downward tendency, no alteration has been announced by the principal makers of the cistriet. Pigs are quoted fully 20 per cent. lower than at ouarter-day, bnt "marked" iron maintains its price. The thin-coal colliers have generally received notice for a reduction of wages- 6d. per day-but in a few instances, the masters, in hopes of improvement, have postponed notice for a week or fortnight. The falling off is in the demand for the furnaces; for house consumption the demand conrtinues good, and wages and prices are well maintained. The varions manufactures of Birmingham are generally Inactive. This may in some degree be attributed to the season of the year, when business is usually somewhat dull; but on the present occasion slackness is more especially the result of American embarrassments and the general badness of the country trade. Factors represent the home demands for ironmongery and brassfoundry to be extremely Ilmited and expect little improvement until the turn of Christmas. The long-expected fall in the price of copper has at length taken place. On Wednesday a reduction of 141. per ton was announced-in the present circumstances of the trade no unwelcome boon to the brassfounders of the town and neighbourhood. The affairs of Farley's Worcester Bank were brought into the Birmingbam District Court of Bankruptcy yesterday. The bankrupts are expected to surrender on Monday. NOTIINGHA, Dxc, 12.

Worsted spinners continue also to workeshort time. This state of things renders the dem.and for material very slowv, and therc is very little eOlng in either yarns or wools, both of which articles hav3 a downward tendency. KIDDERPMISTER, Dic. 12 The carpet manufacture of this town is seriously affected by the p-nicand the cessation of trade with America. The consequence is that the manufacturers are aU working short time, and in soma, it is understood, that when the present orders are completed, they will stop altogether, so that the weavers have a dark prospect before them for Chri%tmas. LBEDS, DEC. 12. There has beon no advance on the slight improvement last reported in the state of the woollen trade of this town and district. The same featnres-short-time working, with ex*reme caution on the parb of both manufacturers and merchants to do nothing but a safe business-are everywhere manifested. The disordered sttte of monetary and commercial affairs in America and on the continent, w'ith daily failures of mercantile house Pt home, continue to depre s almost all kinds of trades, and there is a general complaint of the diffculty of selling goods at remunerative prices, and of getting pay of accounts that are due. StI, iLt is admitted that things, commercially speaking, are better, and that a " good time" is gradually coming. In the oloth.halls today there wP.5 bht a small attendance of buyers, and their operations, which were of a very limited character, vwre in some measure forther restricted by a heavy fog which prevailed during market hours A desire to obtaini goods at lower rates is manifested, and is in most instances acceded to; and this remark applies to both the goods in thu market and to the fewr orders which are diven. Of the woolfen trade generally in this district the Leeds IntcUi,encer today says - There are no indications as yet of any spzing traie, ovet in tlze way o samplegoods The London ho3e3 are chieflyengaged jest now InstocktAlng, and as their arrsngemsats be,ome completed they nasy send their buyers into the rarket. Manufatuorers are looking veryanxioulyforanysIgns of Imnprovemment" EALIFAX, DEc. 12. There is no change to report in the state of the staple trades of this town and district. Everything remains very quiet, especially in the piece goods depsatment. There is a good deal of short time working, and manufacturers are increasing their stocks, but with the turn of the year a hetter demand is expected for thehome trade. There are few sales in wool, and it is difoult to quote prices as a rale for the trade, but they are a trifle lower than lat vweek, The yarn branch is very qudet, and prices a shade lower. Until there be hetter commercial news from the UJnited States and Germany no great improvement here is anticipated. Within the last few days Messrs. Crcesley, the extensive carpet manufacturers, have given their hands more employment, which ls a good sign, but the hands are not working full time, BRADFORD, DEc. 12. The failures on the Continent and in London still exerCise a most unfavourable inflauence upon the worsted trade here. Our market this week has been characterized by the same flatness that pervaded it last week. There has certainly been no improvement in business, but rather an increase of gloom; and most people are less sanguine than they were a fortnight ago with regard to the early return of a better state of things. A revival of trade Is not now expected before January, and even that will depend in a great measure upon thesettlement of conmercial affairsabroad andthe restoration of credit ancd confidence in the mercantile world generally A small failure has occurred at Bradford this week. hr. J. B. Share, agent for tops, &c., has suspended payments, Hlis liabilities are variously statedlfrom 4,0001. to 9,0001.

Here to-day the trade ws exceedigly du, and it waf difficult to dlzpose of any samples of wheat unless a reduction of St. from lat week's prires was submitted to. Barley was qulte lI. to 2?. cheaper. Other artIcles showed a depreersion, and white peas ad Miazagan befans were ls lower ; gray peas, 2e. ; and oats, Is. White wheat, iE4 to 51s.; rpd. 43a, to 47s.; barley, 33e. to 30s.; chevalier, 34S to 41s. ; grinding, 293. to 32a. ;malt, 72s. to 75 .; notes 2Ls. to 29. ; lartridge peas, 40s, to 41s.; white boiling, 3le. to 46s. ; Mazagan beans, 36s. to 40s. The Buffolk markete have been fallng. Owing to the fineness of the weatherthe young wheat crops in this district are looking fine and forward. OAMBR}DGE, DEgo 11. There was very Ulltti alteration In the price of fat stolk, At St. lye's there was a fair supply of fat beef, which sold at 7Ps 3d. to 7a, 6d. per stone; there wae very little doing in iNglish stores.

The temperature of the last few days has been comparatively high, and there baa been scaycely any rain. The dullne. of the advioes from Mark-lane, the liberal arrivals from abroad, and the abseone of speculation from the trade have stil frther depresaed the prices of wheat at tiae loCal markets, At this Exchange to-day the decuie continued, quotations being vienerally 2s. to 3I. per quarter lower; the supply was good, and the miUers purchaEed only to supply their consumptIve requirements. The trade ia barley was dull, and prioes gave way In msny Irstanoes Is. per quarter. In other articles there wa also a downward tendency. hne cattle-market to-day ws well suppUed with storeobeasts; but trade was not vry brisir, and, the supply outstripping the demand. a airge portion of the loin on offer remained undisposed of. Scota realized 4s. to sL 6d.; shorthorna, 3s 6d. to 4. ;and Irteh, 3s. to . 6d. per etune of 141b. (estimated weight when fat).

Little change in fat stock. It is stated that the business of the firm engaged in the corn trade whoso Suspenulonwas announced under this head in" The Times" of Monday last will be oontinued without interruptlion, although the labllitles are very large. ROOHElTEEI DEO. 12, A f iner season than tho present for all kinds of agricultural operations has not been known for a corsiderable number of yeare pact. and the consequence has been that wheat sowing has been carried on under the most favourable circoumstances, while aU other out-door farming work has been pushed forward with muc: spirit. The weatheir is very favourable for wheat thrashing. but farmers prefer holding their stocks untU prices have taken a more favourable turn. The Improved feelig observable last wek In the corn trade of this locaityhas not been sustained, andSthe trade has again relapsed into the gloomy condition observable for several woeks previously. The wheat trade at the varlous local markets has been most de. pses3ed, and the buoyant tone of last week his giren way to a onsL derable reduoUons in price. RELDING, DEO. 12. In this diatrlct the cattle trade in some places has exhibited an Luprovement. There was a good demand for sheep at Lambourn Fair. and prices advanced 2s, to Is, per head. Cart hotaes sold at £ S to £40, aud yourB colt3 at £16 to £30 eaoh Beef ti sellig at Is. 4d. to ES.; mutton, St. Cd. to Ss. 2d. ;and veal at 4d d. to to4s. 1 per stone of Sib. The corn-market this day was lees extenoively supplied with wheat than, a we-ek ego, and but lttle of fine quaUty and In thoroughly dry condition was to be observed. Immediately on the opening of the market it wa3 perceptible that the trade would undergo great altera. tlion. The continuamce of the monetary panic and the large lvuportatiouns of French and American floor Into the Loudon markets recently make the mealmen operate with extreme cau:ion. Holders strove to obtain the rates of last week but this was reAsted, and, as a consequence, businet was in a very inactive state Paroels exchanged hands with sloowoss, and this ate declie of 2s. to So. onprevious currencies. Some farmers, believing that an improve r out must occur after Uristmase, returned their samples to the granaries unsold. The prices realzed were reported to be as followvs:-Besh white wheat 6I2s. to 56s. ; socondary qualities, 48di to 52ls; and inferior, 40s. to 4Si. Red wheat, beit parcels, 50s. to SitS.; econdary, 4Ge. to 60s.; and Inferi6r, 40s. to 46s. Barley and oats declined in price. The corn trade at aU the country markets this week has been in a greatly depresed, State. DUBLIN, DEc. 11.

LONDON, A1OEQDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1857. The House of Lords met on Saturday to rece*e the Royal assent to the Bank Indemnity Bill, and Lord PAN-3m-nE took advantage of the opportunity to read a letter from Sir COLuq CAMPBBLL, in which he efiectually disproved the report that he had been on ill terms with Lord CA.1-ING. Their Lordships then adjourned until the 4th of February. In the House of Commons, on the motion for adjournment, Mr. SPOONER took the opportunity of entering into some explanations regarding the currency queation. In reply to Mr. T. DuNcoini, Lord PAI,MRSTON stated that the Government hoped to submit to Parliament a Bil on the s,ubject of church-rates, and that he proposed to move for a committee on the Corrupt Practices Act. Mr. NEFDEGATE eaUed attention to the widespread and increasing distress among the manufacturing classes, and expressed his conviction that the Government would have the authority of Parliamnent for the adoption of measures of relief. Sir G. GRtEY acknowledged that there had been a great deal of local distress, and that the conduct of the working classes had been highly creditable to them; but it was not in the power of the Government or of Parliament to meet such local distress. A short discussion arose upon a motion of Colonel SiE-ss for a return respecting the .screw steamship Austria, etigaged by the Eabt Jndia Company for the cor.veyance of troops to fTldia. The House, after some further butiness, adjourned at 20 minutes past 4 o'clock until the 4th of February.
A-a the fortunate progreas of affairs in India enables us to gDeefalize on the strange events which for the 1ast six iaonths -have absorbed the interest of the nation, we are jmv; to the singular conclusion that, for the most psrt, the pbenomena of the insurrection have been exactly such as would not have been expected. We admit, of course, that a mutiny of the Bengal Army cannot be represented as otherwise than a most natural catastrophe, after the insight now obtained into its constitution and organization; but, assuming the case of an Indian rebellion, it may certainly be said that the incidents actually presented are precisely the reverse of those which any Indian statesman would have been disposed to predict. Upon the whole, the results are decidedly favourable to our prospects in the East, for elements of apparent difficulty have been proved harmless and even serviceable, while the real sources of peril have been identified with creations of our own which we can unmake as easily as we made them. The safeguard of British India, according to the policy of the Company, was the Sepoy army, nor was the opinion at all devoid of warrant. The Sepoys were a favoured and even a pampered class. Their pay was large, their pensions certain, and their duties easy. The most nervous solicitude was shown in consulting their prejudices, and so popular was the service in the estimation of the natives that a place in the ranks was regarded as equivalent to a provision for life, and vacancies were objects of ambition and contest. In many respects, too, this system seemed to produce a good return. The Sepoy battalions were useful, and, generally speaking, faithful troops. The prospect of a distant campaign usually occasioned some murmurs, and disputes about pay and allowances were by no means unfrequent; but on actual service, and espeoially in couniies remote from their own homes, our native soldiers behaved with great courage, patience, and loyalty. Even in the matter of religious prejudices they sometimes showed themselves superior to temptation. It was not uncommon at Benares and other large cities to see conflicts break out on a considerable scale betwreen the Hindoo and Mussulman sections of the population, and the Sepoys could be relied upon to put down the disturbers of the public peace without respect either for one creed or the other. That military discipline overruled on these occasions any prepossessions of faith was a subject of general observation and notoriety. The danger of British India in the eyes of Indiana politicians resided in the dispositions of the native Princes and in the general instability of Asiatic opinion. Every ruler of a native Court represented a Sovereign reduced to more or less dependence, and naturally liable to moro or less disaffection. As for the people at large, they were Orientals, and as such mnight be expected to join in any revolution from abstract love of political novelty. Whatever might be the solicitudes or the successes of our Administration, it would probably never stand against the prospect of triumphant rebellion. If eny accident should ever throw any province or station into the power of insurgents, and those insurgents could succeed for any period, however short, in defying the force of Government, the whole country, and, in fact, the whole of India, would involuntarily rise. Such were the views commonly entertained on this subject, and with reason too. It is quite true that the native Princes had ground for looking unlovingly on the Britih Government. Our relations with these " country Powers," as they are styled in old Indian history, were necessarily, to some extent, unamicable. We represented European civilization, they the semi-barbarim of Oriental traditions. They hed rot in reality been il-1treated-no other conquerors would ever have treated them half as well. We left very many in possession of what could be hardly caUed their heritages; and even those dethroned in just war were gratified with Royal pensions and unbounded licence. Our supremacy, too, gave them what they never enjoyed before, a guarantee for their thrones, and secured the transmission of titles and properties, which, but for us, would have been lost as easily as they were gained. Still, we represented the controlling and encroaching power; we occasionally enforced our prerogatives with rigour, and the whole policy of the Company, as exemplified in its . lations with native Courts, might have been felt as irksome even where it was not regarded as menacing. Of the Asiatic propensity to revolution we need say but little. If there was one opinion which universally approved itself six months ago, it was that if Delhi held out the contagion of rebeUion must needs prove irresistible. Applying now the test of experience to these assumptions, what do we find? A reversal of opinion at every single point. The defection of the Sepoy army on the alleged ground of religious alarm supplies such a comment on the traditionary policy of the Company as may well impress itself on the mind of the nation. For the sake of this army-this favourite instrument of administration and pet relic of old traditions-the Government of India was content to abdicate half its duties and keep even Christianity itself in the shade, whereas the only result is that the Sepoys have charged us with designs of violent proselytism, and have risen ag,ainstus in deadly revolt on behalf of the very idolatry which we so earnestly professed to respect. Had our expeotations on other points been realized while they were reversed on this, the consequences must have been disastrous indeed; but we have been happily disappointed in our fears as weU as our hopes. The native Princes, as a body, have stood firmly by us; indeed, there is not a single chief of any renown or power-either Hindoo or Mahomedan-who has joined the rebellion. The Rana of OUDEYPOxx, the head of the Rajpoots; the Nizan of the DEccA2N, the most powerful Mussulman Sovereign; SCNDIi and HOLKAR, the representatives of the Mahratta chiefs; JUh' BAuADooR, Prince of Nepaul, with a host of minor potentates in all parts of India, have concurred in embracing our cause, and exerting themselves in our behalf as actively as circumstances would permit. Of aU these Princes the NIzAil might have been expected, perhaps, to have had the least love for the Government of Calcutta, for our terms with his ancestors in respect of subsidies and contingents had certainly been herd, and our intervention in the affairs of his kingdom could no. have been agreeable. To such a pass, indeed, had things arrived at Hyderabad that it seemed a question, some time back, whether that city or Lckinow would be the first to witness the last penalty of misrule. Yet our very latest inteRigence from the scene of the revolt now informs us of a brilliant and timely victory gained over the rebels by the Niz&=x's cavalry, and the forces of this Prince have actualy enabled us to retrieve most seasonably a loss which our own outnumbered troops had sustained. The reports we recently published from Hyderabad were undoubtedly of a character to prepare us for this piece of service, but our obligations to his Highness and his Ministers for their steady fidelity are now practically recorded, and will,we trust, not be forgotten when the tempest is past. Certainly, of all the capricious and paradoxical reversals which opinion could receive none could be imagined more extraordinary than those now illustrated by events in India. That the chief city of the North-West should have remained for four months in the hands of rebels against the British Government; that these rebels should be our own Sepoys, acnd those on1y; that the population of India should be quiescent under the allurements of successful insurrection, or have stirred only to assist the Government; that the native Princes of India should have thrown themselves, one and all, into lor cause, and that the althorities oI Calcutta should have been fighting against their Bengal army with the aid of Ghoorka BattaLous, Cashmere Contingents, old Sikh Artillerymen, and the Nxz=Ws Cavalry-all this presents such a spectacle of phenomena hitherto inconceivable that it seems hard to comprehend it even now. Yet there is a aimple clue to the labyrinth, after all, anid it consists in the agreeable theory that we have mistaLen both the Princes and people of India in supposing they would rise at the first opportunity against our rule. They have evinced no such desire. The only danger of India has now been demonstrated by actual experiment to lie in a domiwnnt Sepoy army. It matters not what origin or cause we attribute to the insurrection itself. On any assumption this one conclusion must follow,-that the instigators of the revolt, whoever they were, or whatever wera their objeets, could imagine or discover but one3 single ins.ruinent to work with. They could do nothing with the people of India, nothing with the mative Courts, nothing over the front-ers, either in Nepaul or Affghanistan; but they could and did take our own pampered Sepoys and convert every battalion of the army into a band of fanatical cutthroats. If the moral of such a lesson is not plain and easy, events will indeed have spoken in vain.
Mr. GLADSTONE says that it is not worthy of the dignity of Parliament to leave the essential and fundamental principles of the currency in doubt. It might be answered that, if the question were still open to dispute, no legislative decision eould put an end to the controversy; but, in the present instance no doubt whatever remains as to the future monetary policy of the country. Both EIouses, by abstaining from any change in the law, have determined that it shall remain as it is. After thie refinements of the witnesses bef6-e the Committee and the audacious heresies propounded at Glasgow, so general an adhesion to the doctrine i of a convertible currency could scarcely have been anticipated. Even Mr. SPOONEn repudiates the proposal of his partner that the relative value of sovereigns and paper should depend on the turn of the market. The great majority of the House of Commons supports the Government in the further determination that cash payments shall not depend merely on the good faith of those who may be authorized to issue promissory notes. The CHkczLLoTR of the ExcHEQeFER avows his intention of standing by the Act of 1844, and Parliament has now adopted the responsiblity of the Ministerial decision. The appointment of a committee to consider the provincial issues and the causes of commercial distress is quite consistent with a resolution to abstain from any attempt to tamper with the currency. Having disposed of the main question, the House of Commons is not concerned to preserve a pedantic or puritanical consistency. Mr. Dis- .AErI's experience ought to have conviuced him that there is nothing to be gained by placing Parliament between thle horns of a dilemma. There may be no logical escape on this side or on that, but a tonmporary disregard of the strict rules of logic at once puts an end to the difficulty. If the law is good, says the triumphant critic, it ought not to be suspended; if it is bad, it ought to be repealed. In reply Parliament both affirms the principle of the law, and tacitly recognizes the possible necessity of suspension. The Act of Indemnity sanctions the doctrine that the Executive Government must provide as well as circumstances may allow against imminent dangers. It seemed better that a Treasury letter should be issued tnan that half the firms in the City should break. Strict economists, supported in this instance by the judgment of some experienced capitalists, declare that the storm would have cleared the air, and that the great catastrophe would have finally destroyed a mischievous system of unsound trading. It is conceivable tbat the good effects of a crash would have outweighed the wide-spread misery which woould have followed, but the Ministers had to decide on their course before, and not after, the event. Inundation and pestilence have sometimes proved eventually beneficial. The Fire of London put an end to the plague; the Great Famine inaugurated the resurrection of Ireland; but no statesmarn would willingly have been responsible for the destruction of a city or for the dccimation of a people. The evils arising from interference with the law of issue were limited, although undeniable. A general bankruptcy might have regenerated commerce if it had been a providential visitation, but the Rlouse of Commons is better pleased that Lord PALMERSTON and Sir C. LEwis declined to assume the functions of PnovmDmzcz. The main question having been disposed of, the Govermnent might have introduced various changes into the machinery of the law. " It is time to "legislate," said Mr. DisRAm, " by repealing the "'law of 1844." " It is time to legislate," sa d Mr. GLADSTONiE, " by declaring the law of 1844 "irrevocable, and by itroducing certain elastic "clauses, of which the nature may perhaps here"after be defined." Lord GREY and Mr. GL&DSTONE demand that the Government should assume to itself the function of issuing paper money, because, among o4her reasons, much confusion now prevails as to the proper business of the Bank. The CHAxcELro of the ExcnEQuEn nevertheless persists in the opinion that before any change is introduced its character and limits ought to be ascertained. Re is even disposed to regard without indignation the continuance of an oldfashioned practice, by which, whenever a loan is contracted, the Bank is reconstituted as a corporation until the final discharge of the obligation. It is shocking, as Mr. GLADSTONE remarked, that a form of which none but Treasury officials ever heard shlould indicate a doubt of the public credit, and a preference for the security afforded by a private corporation. Unfortunately, the House of Commons has no feeling against an anomaly which never cost the country a farthing. The customary clause wil sooner or later share the fate of many similar fictions, with as little general sensation as when Jo0N Doz and RICnAiD ROB terminated their useless but blameless lives. The proposed assumption by Government of the creation of paper money appears a more serious innovation; but the separaton established between the departments of banking and of issue has already produced a similar effect, and the apparently incorrigible confusion which exists in the public mind furnishes at least a plausible reason for further legislation. There is, indeed, nothing mysterious in the juxtaposition of the two establishments under the same roof in Threadneedle-street. The machinery of issue is self-acting, so that precisely the amount of notes is forthcoming which, within the limits allowed by law, is required by the necessities of commerce. If the manufacture were transported to the other end of London, and carried on in the name of the CGOWN, the operation would be precisely the same, except that if the Bank issued notes of its own a second supply of bullion would be required for that purpose. Under the present system, however, a general impression prevails that the Bank of England is bound to supply capital to all legitimate traders. Popular delusions may sometimes be a sufficient ground for legislation, but the population which frequents the Bank counter is not a promiscuous rabble, and it does not seem unreasonable that great merchants and capitalists should take the trouble to understand the existing law of currency. There is another argument against a change. The unreasonable expectations which now revolve rouna the Bank might be still more inconvenient if they were addressed to the Government. Among the numerous peculiarities of English legislation, few contrivances recur more frequently than the interposition of some independent body between the Executive and the community. Private interests are thus enlisted in the public service, and unnecessary collisions are obviated or diminished in violence. The Bank of England may plead, in answer to unreasonable demands, the necessity of protecting itself and of regarding the safety of its shareholders. The Government could only oppose to a simiiar pressure those consideracons of public advantagewhich may always be disputed or forgotten. During the late crisis the Bank was passive to the last, notwith. standing the general demand for a relaxation of the law. The Govermment, on the other hand, had leisure to wait for the proper moment of interference; and in the meantime it was not held answerable for the growing tightness of the moneymarket. Nevertheless, it may be admitted that the question is open to discussion. Sir RoBnnT PEEL at one time contemplated the withdrawal of the Issue Department from the Bank. Lord OVERSTONE, in his irritation at the dullneEs of his opponents, lately admitted that the measure was advisable for the purpose of clearing up a confusion which seemed in itself unaccountable. Except in this respect, the change would produce comparatively little effect. As Lord Gm observed, the issue of paper is analogous to the coinage of money; but the Mint itself in England exercises functions which are merely ministerial. The Government never inquires what supply of sovereigns is required. Owners of bullion take it to the Bank, which, in its turn, demands coin according to its wants from day to day. If a hundred millions were asked for they wonld be furnished in due course. If the establishment were left in total idleness, it would not undertake to provide work for itself. A Government Department of Issue would pursue precisely the same course. The relations of the Bank to the Government in paying the dividends and transacting other public business may possibly deserve investigation, but, as Mr.WEGVuEM explained, there is much convenience in the transfer of money through an establishment where all private bankers keep a banking account. Several millions are paid on every dividend-day by simple entries in the ledgers, with an obvious economy both of labour and of money. At the same time, Mr. GrADSTO?n is fully entitled to point out any defects in the existing practice, and, if possible, to amend a aystem which has nothing to do with currency or with commercial distress. Parliament has not precluded itself from any kind of legislation which may hereafter be thought desirable, but for the present is content to maintain a mix:d and limited circulation, and to devote i:s immediate attention to the wider subject of commercial law or practice in relation to capital and to credit.
The brief Session is now concluded. Parliament was called together at an unusual period to give its sanction to an extraordinary measure which the Government had thought it necessary to adopt in the presence of a great emergency. This measure was nothing less than a temporary modification of the law by which the currency of the empire is regulated. A graver responsibility it Is impossible for the QVE&s' advisers to assume, bat the verdict of Parliament has been favourable to them. In the judgment of both houses the emergency was so great, the circumstances of the time so critical, that had not power been lodged somewhere to relax the stern but inevitable law by which the issues of the Bank are governed, almost universal ruin must have fol. lowed in the commercial world. We are not here about to enter again into the general argurnent. It is ufficient for our present purpose to state that the power of relaxation under certain circumstances is lodged in the hands of the Executive Government, but when they use so formidable a weapon they must be prepared to make out a very clear case in justification of their conduct. This they have now done to the satisfaction of the Legislature, and therefore as a temporary question there is now an end of the matter. The discussion upon the more abstruse theories by which a nation should be guided in the regulation of its currency will now be left, aa beretofore, to the more approprlate arena of a committeeroom. If the currency doctors can devise any plan by which our financial condition can be improved without prejudice to the interests of tbe creditor-if they can endow us with untold wealth without tampering with the sanctity of contracts, we shall not be the last to express to them our gratitude for their patriotic exertions. As far as further inquiry into the subject is concerned, however, we may well be pardoned for doubting, in common with many gentlemen who have taken part in the recent discussion, if it should not be of a more general nature than any which can be conducted before a committee charged merely with the duty of investigating the laws which govern the currency. The commercial failures which have taken place, not only In this country but in the United States and on the Continent of Europe, have disclosed so melancholy a history of the unsound and speculative nature of mercantile transactions at the present day, that the remedy against the recurrence of such calanmities would seem rather to lie with the merchants themselves than with the Legislature. We have no faith in any enactment that professes to provide for the permanent stability of firms which trade to the extent of a million sterling without any capital at all. Much distress, we fear, will occur throughout the country, especially, of course, in the manufacturing districts, as a consequence of the recent commercial difficulties, and of the actual stagnation of trade. The matter was aUuded to in the Speech from the Throne, but it would be idle to suppose that Parliament can afford relief by any legislative enactment to the distress which we all deplore. In a few weeks, as we trust, trade will revive, and then in renewed employment the operatives of the manufacturing districts will find the best set-off against the temporary evils, which they must for ithe while make up their minds to bear with fortitude and resifgnation. In the House of Lor.'s durinog the brief Session just concluded, Lord SHIAFTESBURY has taken the first step to free the clergy of the Established Church from a restriocton which places them in a worse position than the ministers of any of the Dissenting denominations. Next Session we may hope to see a Bill carried through Parliament which will enable the Bishops to make provision for the spiritual instruction of the people in those larger districts where the parochial machinery has been found insufficient. The opposition offered by the High Church Party to this most salutary measure Is not of a very tremendous character, and savours rather of petulance and vexation than of any fixed resolution to hamper the progress of the Bill. In the House of Commons leave has been given to introduce another Bill for the relief of the Jewish Disabilities-a measure which we would gladly see disposed of once for all without any unpleasant collision between the Houses. We are also to have a Bill for "improving and amending" the Public Health Acts-one of the mingr bits of legisla- tion which will prove of considerable practical utility. The discussion upon Sir H. HAVxLOCOeS insufficient pension has also obtained a great share of public attention. There cam be no doubt of the general feeling of England upon the subject. It is, that the Qu=s's advisers have acted in a niggard and ungenerous spirit to this gallant old soldier in offering him a reward in money which, measured as a money reward, cannot be considered as of greater value than a gift of 3,0001. or 4,0001. Such a sum would represent the purchase-money of an annuity of 1,0001. per annum to a man of Sir H. lAvFvLocx's age, even without abatement made for the contingencies of lead and steel. The observation is universal, that had a military chief connected with the aristocratic class or with the Horse Guaids clique performed services much lers important, the gratitude of the Government would have been shown in a very different manner. Lord PALsransToN, however, has pledged himself to take account of the general feeling of the country, and to amend his lame offer as soon as Parliament again a3sembles. We have postponed to the last all mention of the two principal matters which will be brought before the legislative body during the forthcomiDg Session. These are the amendment of the representation, and the remodelling of the system of government which has hitherto been maintained in British India. We still regret that the two subjects should bs forced upon the attention of Parliament during the same Sesaion. One is of immediate and urgent, the other of less pressing importance. It would be most deplorable if the effort to place the government of our Indian Eampire on a proper footing should in anyway be hampered or checked by the jealousies and hear burnings which will certainly arise out of the secondary topic.' We shall not get a good Reform Bill while the subject of India is uppermost in men's minds. We may get a bad Indian Bill if the attention of the Lower House is constantly tdistraeted by the guerilla warfare of divisions and amendments upon the electoral propositions of the Minister. Professed Reformers may well doubt if such be an apt season for a satisfactory discussion upon the subject of Parliamentary Reform. Still, we must deal with facts as we find them. A distinct pledge has been give'a that as soon as Parliament meets again a proposition for amending the electoral franchise shall be laid before the two Houses. We may not augur well of the result, but the difficulty must be accepted. It can need but little remonstrance or warning from us to convince the country that the one subject which toucbes the British name most nearly at the present moment is to provide for the fiiture government of India. To this all other considerations must be subservient.

Tnn OVEnLAID MAILS.-The overland India and Lhina mails tbat arrived last nighk at London-bridge at 10 o'clock have been on their passage from Malta ever since Wednesday morning. The packet most have had heavy weather from Malta to Marseille4, for she arrived at the latter porttin time only for the mails to b3 despatched to Paris by the Saturday morning 10 o'clock train. From Paris the malls were forwarded bg the daily express trafn arri ing at Calais at 4 p.m. The mail-pazket Ondine was sent over to Calals from Dover yesterday in anticipation, and brought Captain Lowe, with despxtches from Lord Canning and the 51 boxes from the roads, and landed them at Dover in a dense fog, whence they came np to London by the regular passenger train, leaving Dover at 7.30 p.m. No effort had been made to expedite the transmi6sion of these mails from Paris on this occ_sion, on account of the Sunday regulations at the Post-office, or they might easily have been in London by 3 p.m. yesterday vid Botogne, or 4 pl. tt4 Caalas. THF IArIs, d&c.---Sou=Adr , Dec. 13.-The Royal Mail Company's steamship Teviot, Captain M oir, sailed yesterday for Alexandria with the Australian mails, about 70 passengers, 1,2001. in specie, jewrelry value !,0001., and a fall caro. The Teviot takes out a small staff of Post-office clers, rwho have a cabin specially fitted up for thelr use, the object being the introduc'ion of a new system of sorting the mails on board during the homneward voyage of the steamer, so as to be ready for transmission to their respective places of destination iimmediately on arrival at this port, instead of being forwarded en masse to the General Post-office and there assorted. By the adoption of this plan a great saving of time will be effected in the delivery of the mails. The United States' mal stearoer Ariel, Captain Ludlow, wbich arrived here yesterday from New York, sailed this morning for Bremen direct, her pa.sengers for Havre having been forwarded to that port by the steamahip Havre, chartered for the purpose.

I NFD IA. By the arrival of the Overland Mail we have received our privato 00mespondence and files of papers from Calcutta to the 9th of November, and from Bombay to the 17th of November. The following is the letter of our Bombay oor. respondent:- BOMIBAY. (FROM 0R OWt N OcauzsPONnDz.) "1 BOMBEBAY, Nov. 17. "I have but little to narrate to you by this mail; but that little is all of an encouraging nature. In three several respects it is satisfactory; districts lately the most disturbed, now purged of mut1neiee are rapidly settling down; districts lately threatened by the movements of large bodies of the rebels are, for the present at Ieast,safe from the anticipated visitation; and further, and especially, the intur. rection is more and more centering itself in Oade and about the capital of that province,where we shail be able to deal it such a blow as must be fatal to its vitality. Add to thl, that English reinforcements are pouring into Calcutta by thousands, and that in the two smaller Presidencies and in the Nizain'g country all is perfectly quiet, while in Rajpootana alone has there occurred any fresh outbreak, and we arrivo at an aggregate of intelligence sufficiently encouraging and if itself comparatively uneventful, yet plainly presaging great events. Of Lucknow itself, now again, and as much perhaps as ever, the object of our hopes and aspirations-for again there Is a garrison to relieve, or at least to reinforce-very little intelligence has reached us since I last wrote. This is easily accounted for. Between the Residency and its vicinity, where Outram and Havelock are intrenched, and the fortified post of Ahlunbagh, on the Cawnpore road, there is a distance, you will remember, of some three miles. While from the Ganges to Alumbagh the road is, for a party of moderate strength, perfectly clear, the remaining three miles are beset with difficulties formidable even ito an army. Here are cong gregated in masses mutineers of the Oude Irregular force and of the regular Bengal army, armaed retainers of rebel Pathan or Rajpoot zemindars, and the loose ferocious population that swarms in the bazaars of a Mussulman city; and their position, though we have no exact details of its nature, is clearly a strong one, inasmuch as it consists of a portion of the city, thus involving an attack by our troops in narrow streets and upon houses and walls held by the enemy, a mode of fighting in which, and in which alone, as we know from old Delhi experience, the mutineers show to advantage. Through such a barrier as that constituted by this formidable position it is not surprising that but little correspondence has been able to force its way. Enough, however, has by one means and another reached Cawnpore to show that Outram and Havelock were well holding their own at the beginning of the present month. You may remember that in a postscript to my letter of a month back I told you, as the latest news from Lucknow up to the latter days of September (the garrison having been relieved on the 25th), that the greater part of the city was by that time in our possession. This came by letter from Cawnpore, nevertheless it appears to have given too favourable a view of the state of affairs at the capital of Oude, for as late as the 16th of October I only read in the report of a spy, or ' man of the intelligence department,' that half the city was in our power. It was probably against the remaining half, and in the attempt to cut a passag,e to the party at Alumbagh, that the efforts of the force were directed in the engagemeat or series of engagements that ensued. Of the result of this hard fighting we know nothing save that Alumbagh was not attained, and, as we hear of no further actlons,we conclude that Sir James Outram and his colleague having experienced an obstinate resistance determined on remaining quietly in their intrenchments till the force at Alumbagh should be so strongly reinforced as to be able to force its way through, or to attack the enemy's rear, while they again assaulted his front. And, happily, they would not have long to wait. Indeed, I cannot doubt that while I write the great battle is already some days old; for on the 30th of last month the Delhi column, lately known as Colonel Greathed's, and now commanded by Colonel Grant, of the 9th Lancers, as Brigadier, crossed into Oude from Cawnpore, and on the following morning marched for Alumcagh. It mustered 3,500 men, its losses on the march and in action having been supplied by about 400 of the 93d Highlanders, and details of the 5th Fusileers and the Royal Artillery. The column reached Alumbagh unmolested, and when last heard of, about the 8th inst., was halted there awaiting the arrival of Sir Colin Campbell from Cawnpore. The Commander-in-Chief reached that station a few days after the departure of Grant's force, and crossed the river on the 9th. 'We do not know what number of troops he took with him in person. Indeed, the fact of his crossing into Oude is as yet only known from Sir Robert Hamilton's brief telegram to Lord ElphinBtone from Madras, alluded to above; but, what with the 53d, the remaining -wing of the 93d, and artillery, he may have added to the Brigadier's column no fewer than 1,500 men, raising the amount of the reinforcements to 5,000, with a numerous artillery. At Alumbagh itself he would find, perhaps, ],000o efibetives, with large supplies of provisions and of ammunition conveyed thither shortly before by Major Buraston and 500 men. " At the head of so compact and welU equipped a force, Sir Colin would doubtless proceed at once against the enemy, and, aocordingly, it is, as I have said, probable that already the blow has been dealt and a second central fire of insurrection been trodden out. " But it will of course be long ere the province Is tranquillized, though the capital may be now wholly in our power. Oade may be expected to be for a time one great battle-field. Indeed, the more it becomes so the better it will be for us. The more of the mutineers we can get across the Ganges the less difficulty and delay there will be in tranquilLizing the North-West and the less danger for Central India. And the river once crossed there wonld be little fear of a return in force, for those who escaped the ssword in Oude would be intercepted by the English troops wlvo by that time would be pouring up the great roads to the North-West. We need not, therefore, be alarmed because Oade has proved so attractive to the main body of mutinous soldiery still at large. On the contrary, T should, for the sake of Ialiwa, and even of the Deccan, be inclined to fear that the capture of Lucknow might avert from Oude the threatened visitation of the Gwalior mutineers. But of these presently. They are not yet, and may never be in Oude. The Dinapore regiments, how ever, with Kooer Singh and his retainers, who have long been quiet at Banda, uncertain, probably, whither to betake themselves when Delhi fell, have been making their way to the Ganges in detached parties, and have for the most part, I suppose, joined the rebels at Lucknow. One body of them was fallen in with on the Grand Trunk Road, just upon Futtehpore, between Allahabad and Cawnpore, by a detachment of 500 men and two guns, under Colonel Powell, of the 53d, and Captain Peel, who were on their way to Cawnpore. The enemy were strongly posted near a village called iKudpore, but, as usual, their position was oarrie,
CHINA. (FROM OUR OWs CoRPsMzNDMT.) HONGKONG, Ocr. 30. By the arrival of the Gas on the 26th inst. we received the London mail of the 10th of September. The steamer Ottawa with theloutwad mail leave5 to-day. Lord Elgin is here, and it in probable he wilr not leave the place till the results of the demonstratione against Canton are known. We understand as soon as the whole foree of Marines arrive operations will commence. The first detachment arrived on tthe 28thl inst. in the: steamer Inmperador. The despatch gunboat Cormorant and gunboat Banterer arrived from Manilla yesterday. An expedition under Commodore EMot, condsting of the gunboats Plover, Opossum, and Staunchs with some shipe' boats, left Tiger Island on the 14th% inst. After a cruise of several days they came out. near the junction of the great west and north rivers, and arrived at Macao on the 19th inst. During the cruise several Mandarin junks and some forts. were destroyed, but private property was noti interfered with. The people of the towns whioh were passed willingly assisted in pointing out the 31andarin boats, understanding, apparently, the object of the expedition. I regret to have to report another accident on. board ship arising from Chinese treachery. Theschooner Neva left this on the 17th inst. with a valuable cargo of treasure and merchandise bound! to Foochow. The following evening some Chinese passengers, assisted bythe carpenter of the ship, killed; the captain and a couple of the seamen who wereon deck. The mate escaped up the rigging, where he remained till the Chinese left the vessel, whichthey did after two or three hours, taking with them. about $22,000 worth of treasure. When the vesser was taken possession of she was steered into MirBay, close to this, whence she was brought back by the mate on the morning of the l9th inst. Rewards. are offered for the apprehension of the perpetrators, of this act, but no clue has been got of them as yet. The British ship Cathaya, which left this on the 14th inst. for Foochow, was lost on the Prata shoat on the 20th inst. The captain and crew arrived here in the ship's boats, and brought with them about $10,000 worth of the treasure which was on board the ship. The French Minister, Baron Le Gros, visited his Excellency Sir John Bowring on the 16th inst. His Excellency was received here with the usual salutes and a guard of honour.

The Shah of Persia has officially put an end to the mission of Ferukh Khan. That diplomatist will leave Paris in January, and travel for two months in other countries of Europe. He wiU then take leave of the Emperor, and embark at Marseilles in a French ship of war for Trebizonde. The Pays states that the British troops sent from England to India ?i Egypt had arrived at Aden from Malta in 12 days. Stores and an hospital had been established at Aden for the receptlon of these troops. The French Government has received despatches announcing that Omar Pasha, appointed Civil and Mdiitary Governor of Bagdad, had arrived on the 24th November at Alexandratta, on board the Turkish steam corvette Vacita-i-Tidjaret, on his way from Constantinople to take powsession of his appointment. The steam cutter Sersi-Djedid, m which the Pasba's staff embarked, had separated from the corvette and had nearly been lost on the coast of Syria. She fortunately arrived at Alexandretta on the 26th November. Omar Pasha immediately set out for Aleppo. A letter from Jerusalem of the 20th ult. states that great agitation prevaDed in that city and the neighbourhood. A conflict had taken place between the inhabitants of Bethlehem and those of Tamar, in which one man was killed and several wounded. Caravans of pilgrims were beginning to arrive in the country. Jerusalem is crowded with pilgrims of a new character. A great part of the crew of the American frigate Congress had arrived there to visit the holy places, together with a great number of the crews of the three Russian ships-of-war anchored at Jaffa. The Princess de la Tour d'Auvergne is likewise expected at Jerusalem, The French architect Giove, who had been commissioned by the Emperor to examine the state of the Church of St. Anne, ceded to France, had quitted Jerusalem and returned to Constantinople. An attempt was made by the Camarilla of the King Consort of Spain to obtain for His Majesty the authority to sign decrees and perform other acts of royal authority,-in fact, to be Regent during the period the Queen should be unable to transact public business with her Ministers. As the King's influence over Her Majesty has for some time past been very great, he was very near succeedIng, and it required all the firmness of one or two of the Ministers to prevent it. With respect to the feeling as to the birth of a Prince, the pple regard it with satisfaction, in the hope that Her Majesty will, in the interest of her son, allow the country to be governed better than it has been for a long time past.

The Ministers of Commerce and Finance hero, apparently profiting by the sad experience our owvn money-market iS just nowv making, have issued, under dates of the 1st inst., a circular instruction to the presidents of the provinces for the guidance of the Government inspectors of the few provincial private banks that exist in Prussia. In this circular it iS pointed out that certain private banks had of late manifested the desire to rediscount the long bills they had takenufom their customers, and that application had been made for permission to be extended to the provincial branches of the Royal Prussian Bank to rediscount such paper. Such permission it is said in this circular must be refused in the interest of the Royal Bank and its branches; it is also a departure from the legitimate province of a bank to grant facilities, and thus incur liabilities that exceed its owvn individual means of meeting. In special and exceptional cases it would be adrnissible for private banks to rediscount their paper in hand, but, as the granting or withholding of this assistance wvould always depend upon the will and capability of others, it ought never to form the basis of a regular system of business. As the practice of rediscounting its long bills makes italmost impossible for a bank to keep a strict watch over its liabilities, the Government inspectors are required to report what banks indulge in this practice, and whether they are ln the habit of r3dlscounting for other banks.. The circular goes on to require that in fu ture, instead of the monthly staterment of the banks' position lumping the whole available funds on the credit side into one item, it shall distinguish between specie and bullion, and between bank-notes (Uasemve-anweisubngca) and endorsed notes. Among the other items on the creditor side of this monthly statement the banks are required in future to distinguish between the amounts due to them on "'overdrawn accounts " and on " credits opened." Prince Frederick William, on his return from his visit to the King and Queen at Charlottenburg on Tuesday last, proceeded, in company of his architect, Professor Strack, to inspect the pr^gress of the palace that is being converted to his use; and yesterday afternoon he devoted several hours to a similar inspection of the suite of apartments that he and the Princess Royal are to occupy provisionally in the Royal Schloss, on their arrival here next February. The external work of the future palace is already so far completed that the scaffolding is taken down on all sides, with the excception of that portion of the front where a new portico is to be added, and it is very satisfactory to observe, not only how extremely well the " Palacse of the old Kinig" looks after its metamorphosis, but also how warm is the interest taken by al25o.S LlS oplto all classes in its completion. - 4 As ladlies in waiting on the Princess Royal when she enters on her new dignities here have been ap- inted the Countess Perpoucher (Mistress of the Rbes), the Countess Lynar, and the Countess Holienthal; in compliance with Court usage, the Princess wi not be attended by any lady of her own Court and nation. The Princess Stephanie of Hohenzollern, the future consort of the young King of Portugal, is about to arrive here on a visit to the Prince and Princess of Prussia. Early next spring she will proceed to London, whence she win be fetched by a brother of the King, who wi have a Portuguese flotila under his command. She will also be convoyed to Lisbon by the Prussian frigate Thetis. Lieutenant-General Baron von Omphal has been intrusted with a mission from the King and Queen of the Netherlands to proceed to the Court of St. James';, and there in all form sue for the hand of the Princess Alicoe in the name of the Crown Prince of the Netherlands, William, Prince of Orange. THE MONETARY CRISIS IN THE NORTH OF EUROPE. The advicee from Norway and Sweden announcea various failures. The Norwegian Government has advaneed 1,000,000 of dollars; 400,000 marks banco have been already sent to Eie]. Respecting the firm of M. Pontoppidan and Co., the sum of 1,000,000 marks banco has been forwarded to it from Copenhagen, but it is presumed that a larger sum will be required. The crisis is beghnning to be felt at St. Petersburg. The Austrian Government has advanced a loan of 10,000,000 florins to the city of Hamburg at 6 per cent. The amount is to be paid into the Hamburg Treasury in silver. The loan is for 12 months. IHA2BEURG, Dxc. 11. The following particulars are mentioned in the Copenbagen reports up to the 9th inst. which have come to hand here:- " On the reoeipt of a telegram from Hlamburg this morning, drawn up and signed by State Councillor Westenholz, Mr. Levy, agent of the Mintk and Mr. Tietgens, a director of the Copenhagen private bank, In which it was stated that the firm of H. Pontoppidan and Co. would be enabled, with the help of 1,000,000 marks banco (75,0001.), to resume its payments, the National Bank, In conjunction with the Department of Finance, have agreed to grant this amount of money, as they clearly perceived the great and significant importanoe, un furtherance of the interest of the Danish trade, of supporting the firm. The bank will tberefore advance one-third and the Finance Admi. nstration two-thirds of the million required for the purpose, but the latter demanded the guarantee of the mercantile community, in solcdum, for the repayment of the half of their advanoce. For this purpose subscriptions were opened immediately on 'Chanrge, and within hailf an hour the amount of 540,000 marks banco were subscribed. Several of the most influential merchants next joined in the expresw sion of their opinion that, notwithstnding they were highly delighted at the aid rendered to so highly influential and respectasble a firm, it should, however, not be forgotten that in Eamburg, as well as in their own city, there existed a great many other firms in the greatest difficulties, and if immediate assitance were not rendered to them also a speedy end by bankruptcies would be put to a great portion of the firms in question, and Danish commerce and enterprlse suffer the greatest injury. It was, consequently, resolved to hold a meeting on the following morning, on the Exchauge, to consult whether It would not be beter to grant a portion of the amount subsoribed for as the guarantee for the Finance Minister-that is above the 330,000 marks to complete the half of the two-thirds, the sum required-or 210,000 marks -to other purposes of aid, and to subscribe further sums for the same purpose." A telegram, of which the following is a translation, appeared here this morning, giving the result of the meeting alluded to in the foregoing:- " The result of to-day's neeting on the Exchange was to the effect that the association of the first merchants should speedUy entreat the Govornment to grant the fur. ther sum of 4,000,000 rix thalers, for the purpose of discounting." There was great commotion yesterday among a number of our first-rate firms, and Mr. Carl Heine has been consulted, among others, relative to negotiations pending and plans suggested in order to prop up the still tottering fabric of hamburg's commercial existence, but little or nothing has transpired beyond interviews said to have taken place between some of the most iniluential members of the firms in question andtheSenatorial authorities with respect to the urgent necessity that speedy and effectual aid should be given to prevent a further continuation of failures, which, if they take place, will bring down with them a vast niumber more. It is reported that Messrs. Baring, Brothers, have offered to advance to a dozen firms of this city a sum offectually to secure their safety againBst coming events, provided they agree to guarantee the repayment thereof individually as well as collectively, or in solidum, as the term is used. All this Is, however, rumour. The mail from the Brazils is most anxiously expected, and, should evil tidings come by it, another hard blow may fall upon the houses connected with that trade, and thus increase the difficulties of the hour immensely. 4 O'CxOCcu r,sx, I have just learnt that the Bil.rgerschaft will assemble to-morrow, by order of the Senate to conaider proposals for raising a further sum of money to aid several first-rate firms under the most pressino difficulties. Any sum proposed and granted will be guaranteed by certain firms in solidjum.
WBST COOAST OF AFRICA. PLYMOUTH, DEC. 11. The African Steam Navigation Company's maU packet Gambia, Commander Tutt, arrived this morning. She left Fernando Po November 3d, Bonny, 6th; Lagos, 9th; Acora, l1th; Cape Coast, 12th; Liberia, 17th; Sierra Leone, 21st; Bathurst, 24th; Goree, 26th; Teneriffe, December lst; and Madeira, 3d. She brings 2,000oz. of golddust and 4,0001. in specie, and her cargo includes three tons ivory, 500puncheons palm oll, 115 bales cotton, and 20 packages merchandise. The coast is healthy. Quiet prevails at Fernando Po. Trade is dull at Cameroons, Old Calabar, and Cape Coast Castle, but improving at Lagos and Sierra Leone. Heavy gales of wind have driven shipping from their moor. ings at Teneriffe and at Madeira, where the Queen of the East, bound for Melbourne, has landed the crew of the ship Dorchester, bound from Liverool for Bombay, which was abandoned 60 miles north of the island, with nino feet of water in her hold. The African cruisers continue their activity. Commodore Wise on the night of the 20th of October seized two canoes full of slaves off Cabenda, Their owners intended to have conveyed them to a barracoon 50 miles northward. The Steamsloop Alecto, 5, Commander James Hunt, took her sixth prize into Sierra Leone on the 13th of November. The editor of the New Bra says:- "The prize had contrlved for a considerable time to baulk several of the boats of our cruisers, by which she was boarded, by showing under her fore hatoh,a quantity of worthless gum in bags, and a few casks of rum and palm oil at the main hatch, to induce the belief that she was a regular trader, while these articles served effectually the purpose of hiding a slave deck ready laid. Reliable information, however, had been received of her being fully equipped for the trade, which led to her being more closely searched and her ultimate detention. This vessel is a perfect beauty andis nearly new, with splendid accommodations- under sail our fastest cruisers would stand but a poor chance with her, aided by wind and Bteam-indeed, It mayalmost be regretted that so fine a ship should be demolished, in comformity with the Act of Parhament. The Alecto also captured a fne schooner, the Clara WiUiams, which sailed a few days before the bark, and had just arrived. There are now lying in this port three captured vessels, barks, to be con. demned, two being destroyed, one discharging, one being sold to-day, and one schooner just arrlved. The many captures made by our cruisers of late cannot fail to discourage the inhuman monsters who persist in carrying on this barbarous traffic, however formidable may be the number of vessels embarked by them in the trade, and we heartily wish the officers of our cruisers success in the pro. secution of their humane work." The case of the Spanish bark Conchita, Eugenio Bayona, master, seized by Her Majesty's steamvessel Firefly, George Firth Day commander, in the roadstead of Whydah, for being equipped for the slave trade, was heard in the British and Spanish Mixed Court of Justice on the 5th of Novem. ber before George Skelton, Esq., Her Majesty's British Commissiouer, and his Excellency Colonel Hill, who represented the Spanish Commissioner, Mr. Dougan appear. ing as advocate for the seizors, and Mr. Shervington advocate for the claimants. The Conchita left Barcelona on the 23d of Dccember last for the West Coast of Africa. She; arrived at Whydah and landed her cargo there; she then proceeded to Bahia in ballast, where she received a cargo of roll tobacco and aguardiente. At Bahlia Eugenio Bayoua was appointed master, the former master being too unwell to proceed. She then returned to Whydab, where she was captured by the Firefly. The Court, after hearing the advocates on both sldes, adjourned to the following day for the purpose of pronouncing judgment in the case, and then further adjourned to Saturday, when the vessel was condemned to the Crowns of Great Britain and Spain, on the ground that she had on board at the time of capture upwards of 3,290 gallons of water, sufficient for 253 days for a crew of 13 persons, and 55'spare planks which were adapted for laying down a second or slave deok, no Custom-house certificate having been produced, stating that these articles were intended for lawful purposes as required by the treaty, and that none of her papers, excepting the Fort pass had been passed through the Custom-house at Bahia. Her Majesty's steam-sloop, Hecate, 6, Commander George F. Burgess, was at Fernando Po, bound to the southward. The steamship Heela, 6, Commander Elphinstone Aplin, and the steamvessel Modusa, 4, Commander Wiliam Bowden, were at Lagos, on the polt of sailng for Ascension; and the steamship Antelope, 3, Commander J. W. Pike, for the southward. At Sierra Leone-the steamaboop Vesuvlus, 6 Commodore Charles Wise, and steam-vessel Merlin, 6, Comimander C. W. Buckley. The screw steamship Conflict, 8, Commander R. W. Courtenay, from Plymouth, arrived November 20. Two French ships of war were at Goree. The African Steam Navigation Companys mail packet Candace was off Cape Palmas, all well, November 15. The Ethiope left Madeira for the Coast December 2. The North of Europe Steam Company's ship Propeller, Captain Barnwell, sustained some derangement of her machinery off Fernando Po on the 27th of October. The crewr steamship Powerful was on the beach at Fernando Po on the 3rd November, with alter-pipe broken. The Malaki wam at Bonny on November the 6th; the Oscar m Sierra Leone, November 21; and the Polly, from Buenos Ayres, at Madetra, December 3, with shalt broken. The sailing bark Arabian was appointed to leave Cameroons on the 1st of November. The Lycdi, Loodianah, and Para. matta were at Old Calabar. The Majestic, Golden Age, Sunshine, Grand Bonny, Dorothy Mississippi and Faith were at Bonny; the Pomona, for EIverPool, sailed Octobl,r 27th. The brig Alligator, an American bark and a Srdiniar brig, bound south, were at Cape Coast vastle. Tiae American bark S. L. Porter was at Bathurst, bound soath. The American ship Defiance, from Liverpool, with railway iron, was atTeneriffe, leaky, and will probably be condemned. Spoke, December 7, in lat. 42 22 N., long. 14 20 W., the ship Meroo, 12 days from Liverpool, bound or Rio Janeiro.
IR5LA ND. MTYO ELELCTION. (FR~O ovx ow2T eongoDN. Apparently daunted by the power of the Church, as governed byAxchbishop M'Hale and administered by such mild subordinates as Fathers Conway and Ryan, Mr. Ouseley BRiggins has rshrunk from the falfilment of his pledge to fight over again the battle of Roman Catholic independence whenever a second opportunity should offer. Mr. Higgins' valedictory address has just been issued, and, ae it is in some respects a remarkable docoment, an extract is appended by way of a lesson to any future condidate who may be prepared to encounter smilar perils as the cost of a seat in Parliament .- " At the last election (says Mr. Higgins) I received the votes of more than 1,000 electors of whom nexrly 800 honoured me with their undivided saffrage. They repre. sented the greater portion of the landed interest of the county, the gentry, and middle classes, as well a of the yeomen whose spirit and intelligence taught them to exercise t eir franchise as they thought fit. As against either of the extreme parties by whom I was opposed they formed a large majorlty, overwhelmingly so as regards that section -which Is now unrepresented and powerlesg in the county, for Its own political objects, it was necessary, therefore, to form a coalition between the extreme parties; but even the heterogeneous body thus banded gether was insu9icient to overcome the public opinion of the county. Personalviolence and spiritualintimidation vwere acoordingly invoked, and It was only by the unsparing use of those unconstitutional weapons that my defeat could be accomplished by a smal majority. Te Vindicate the cause of freedom of election and that of my supporters I determined to test the legality of those practices. I did so, and the result is known. A tribunal of Im artialgentlemen of different shades of politics, after a prolonged and paistaking inquiry, unanimously decided that the election was not an election at all, and that Mr. Moore had not been retmrned. They further pronounced that gentlemau constitutionally unfit to represent -Mayo in the present Parliament, anddireotedtwooftheprinsipaloffenderstobeprzosecutd The course I adopted In reference to these events was not unattended with muchpersonal trouble. I felt, however, thatIhad a duty to discharge to the principles I professed, as well as to those who supported those prindples In piy humble person. I hope you wiU sa I have discharged that duty, On the present occasion I feel no distrust of the steadfastness of my old supporters, nor have I the less desire to be useful to my native county. If the battle could be fought constitutionally there would be no doubt of the result; but week by week I have evidence too strongly leading to the convic. tion that the same spiritual influence and the same unconstitutional practices would be again used as extensively as before - and, though your good opinion might enable ine to triumpah over them-though the proper tribunal might again neutralize their efforts, If successful, I confess I do not feel warranted In taling the responsibility of subecting you and myself to the dangerous aud wearyin ordeal." The field being thus clear, it is just probable that Lord John Browne will meet with no serious opposition from any quarter, Whigs and Tories being content to take his Lordship " for better or for worse." Lord John's politics class him as a supporter of the Iberal party. ElICUMBSEED EST=T8 COURT. The sale of the vast estates of the late Marquis of Thomond has been completed, and the gross amount realized each day stood thus :-First day, 56,5401.; second day, 67,9051.; third day, 100,8311.; to which is to be added the sum produced by the lots sold by private contract, 131,4011. Rostellan Castle and desmesne, part of the Cork estate, was put up on Thursday, but the sale was adjourned when the biddings had reached 21,5001., or about 21 years' purchase on a valuation of 1,0091. a-year, The following few particulars in connexion with the sale and subdivision of the estates may not be without interest. They are taken from the Irish Farmers' Gazette:- "; One of the greatest proofs tbat late years have afforded of the increasing prosperity of this country was given during the sale of the estates vested In the trustees of the late Marquls of Thomond. This sale exemplified the truth of a statement often made, that the spirit of providence and anxiet for independence and security of tenure was now the rule among the holders of land in Ireland, and tha, were a favourable opportunity offered, the small farmers would, to a considerable extent, become proprietors of the soil on which their labour was expended. With a property circumstanced as this was a division into smal lots was worth at least a trial. The trial was given, and the result has proved as benefioial to the seller as, we have no doubt, it will ultimately be found to aid the progress of improved farming. The Clare estates, having an acreage of 18,595s producing a net rental of 3,9141., and valued at 4,9851., were divided into 183 lots. Of these, two lots were chief rents, producing 31. 8s. 10d. annually, the valuation being 911. They brought the sun of 91h 12s. 6d. Of the remaining 181 lots six were held under leases and one under an agree. ment for a lease. At the sale by auction the Clare property realized a surm of 124,4451. The portion preo viously sold, as appears by the figures already published, brought 120,8281. The sale of six lots was adjourne The Cork estates were divided into 77 lots. Of these 35 lots are held under lease; the residue, as In the case of the Claro property, being held by the tenants from vear to year, or at will.

In addition to the golden freight of the Simla, sae brought remittances for upwards of 1,000 000 sterlingand it is calculated that, in addition to this iarge amount, at least 500,0001. would have been transmitted from South Australia if the Simla had been the bearer of a mail from that colony. It is quite evident from these Imperfect arrangements, as well as frequent delays, that a thorough modification of the existing postal arrangements between thiscountry andtheAustraliandependenclesmustbeado ted, The home Government must act independently of theloca interests of each colony, and establish two postal communications per month, which can be easily effected by availing themselves of the route to the East Indies, now about to be established weekly as far as Ceylon, and thence by a direot course to the nearest point and most central geographical position of these colonies.-Mining Journna7 of Dec. 12. SnIPwVRCK OFF CAPE CnE&aB.-At break of day on Sunday, the 6th inst., a ship's long boat approached the southern coast of Cape Clear, and was observed by some persons from the island, The crew called piteously for relief, and wrer directed by signs3to the nearest landing The sea at the thne rolled very high, and -with great difculty the boat was brought nea rthe shore, The crew, consisting of 10 men, were perfectly unable to get on land, and were taken bodily out of the boat by the poor men who came to their rescue. They belonged to the Grecian brig Epauinondas, Captain Guzman, laden with corn from the Sea of Azoff to Cork for orders. The crew consisted of 12 men, and arrived safely to within 120 miles south-west of Cape Clear, when, on Tuesday night, the 1st inst., she sprang a leak, foundered, and went down. At this time six men were on watch, and six below. The bulwarks were carried away, and, labourlng under a heavy sea, her hold was filled with water, The crew became instanUty alarmed and betook themselves to the long boat, So precipitate was their haste that they brought with them no compass, sails, clothes, or money. In launching the long boat from the bridge a part of her keel was taken away, and the few garments they possessed were employed in staunching the leak. They had no food or water on board, and in that condition they floated on the surface of the sea four days and nights at the mercy of Providence and the winds without hope of succour and despairing of salvation. When at length, on Sunday morning, they were brought on shore by the poor fishermen of the eastern end of Cape Clear, no more melancholy spectale was ever presented to human view. On the first day after leaving the vessel one of the men died of cold and hunger in the boat. On the second day the captain's brother died from the same causes. When the 10 men remaLuing were taken out of the boat, with limbs brised and broken, and, on being moved, uttering the most pierong shrkek It caused a senasation in the minds of those who witnessed the scene which the7 wiill neVer forget, The escape of the crew was most provf denffal, considering the desperates8tate of the weather dring those days. If the had been throrwn on any other pat of Cape Clear, or if they had reached the shore at night, there could have been no probability of their safety.-Cork
JUDICIAL COMMIrTEB of the PBIVY COUNCIL, Dec. 11. _- SORFENSEN V. THE QUEPN.-TEH BALTICA. (Bcforc Earl GRAIiYTLE (Lord Pri&ntO, LoM Jusice K?GnT BRUoC, the CHF BARON, fr. P.EBERTON Ll!GH, Sir W. AuLzX, Sir E. Ry1A, Sir J. PAT. TRSO.N, and Sir J. DODSON.) ±uas was An appesl orom a declsion of the Court of Admi. ralty, condemnoig the ship Baltica as good and lawful prize. This vessel, together with six others belonging to the same owner, was condemned in August, 1855, bat in March last that condemnation was reversed by the Judicial Committee in one case, the Ariel, and all the vessels were restored by the Admiralty with the exception of the Baltica, the seizuro of whichwas aLeged to beiustifiAbleupo aagrounddifferentfrom any of those relied upon in the case of the ArieL The present case hasalready beenarguedbeforetheir Lordships, who, however, directed it to be re-argued by one counsel upon each side. It appeared that in 1862 the Baltica was sold by pub lie auction to E. Sorensen, a mierchant and Danish Consul at Libau that on the 6th of 31;arch, 1854, she was sold by him to is son Hermann A, Sorensen, the appellant, a Danish merchant at Altona, together with the Ariel and the other vessels; that she was at that date prosecuting a voyage from Libau to Copenhagen, and that upon her arrival at Copenhagen she was delivered to Mr. Christianen, the agent of k[ertan Sorensen, branded as Danish property, and put in charge of a Danish master and a Danish crew. From Copenhagen she proceeded with a cargo of linseed to Leith, where she arrived in the begin. ning of June, 1854, when the seizure was effected. The ground upon which the case of the Baltic& was distinguished from that of the Ariel was, that the sale was made in transitu, the purchase brief, dated ibau, hIarch 5,1854, expressly describing her as " then prosecuting a voyage to Copenhagen." The only question nowt arguedi before their Lordshipe was whether the fact that the vessel was in tran.situ at the tune when she was sold by an enemy to a neutral rendered the sale invalid as against a belligerent, the sale of other vessels under similar circumstances, but not while they were in transitu, having been held to be valid. Dr. PHmLrmoR (with whom was Mr. Atherton) argued the case for the captors; Dr. ADDA.eS (with whom was Dr. Twiss) for the owners. Their LORDSImPs took time to consider thetr decision. In the course of the morning Lord GranviUe received the telegram from India, and immediately communicated it to the other members of the Council. SATunDAY, DEO. 12.

The arguments in this case were to-day resumed and concluded. The decision of the Court of Arches, from which Mr. Ditoher appeals, reverses the sentence of deprivation pronounced by the Diocesan Court of Bath and Wells against Archdeacon Denison for maintaining doctrine contrary to the articles of the church of Eugland, on the ground that the proceedings in the suit were not eom. menced within two years after the commission of the offence charged. The only. question therefore before their lordships is, whether under the 20th section of the Church Discipline Act (3d and 4th of Victoria, cap. 86), fixlng the limit of two years for the commencement of any " suit or proceeding," two years are to be reckoned, as the appellant contends, from the commission of the offence charged to the issuiMg of a commission by the bishop to inquire whether there is a prim4 facie case for further proceedings, or to the service of articles of accusation by the complainant upon the person accused subsequent to the report of such commission, or whether they are to be reakoned, as the respondent contends, from the commission ot the offence charged to the institution of a suit in the diocesan court subsequent both to the report of the commissdon and to the fling of articles of accusation.

The causes (for there are eight) now come on at the hearing, and resolve them. selves into a motion, the object of which Is to obtain an inquiry to the E1ast Indies relative to the marriage of the testator, Dr. Peter Cochrane, with a native lady known as the Beebee Baheim, which is alleged to have taken place twice-once at Furrokabad, and again at Cawnpore, with considerable solemnity, but according to the Mahomedan rituaL Alfidavits have been made in the cause relative to this marriage, and a commission to India was pressed for, but refused upon the ground that there was no probability of any further evidence being obtained. It is, how. ever, now alleged on behalf of Mrs.Roorhouse, the daughter by this marriage, that a woman nearly 90 years of age, now living in India, was present at and can depose to the mar. riage; and as this, if true, will entitle Mrs. Moorhouse, as legitimate daughter of Dr. Cochrane, to the whole of the enormous fund in court (upwards of 220,0001.), It is in fact the turning point in the case. The question of domioil of the testator Is also of great importance, as regulating the disposition of the property, and will be argued after the question of mariage and legitimacy has been disposed of in argument.

SATURDAY, DEa. 12. (Before Vice-Chancellor Sir JoHN2 STUART and M1r. Justce ERLE.) SCOTT V. CORPORATION OF LIVERPOOL. This was a suit by contractors against the corporation of Liverpool and their engineer for an account of works per. formed by the plaintiffs for the corporation in relation to the waterworks authorized by the Legislature to be constructed for supplying that town with water, and for payment of what might be found to be due to the plaintiffs on the taldng of such accounts, The case was argued before the ViceChancellor and Mr. Justice Erle on the 2d, 3d, and 4th inst., and Mr. Justice Erle now delivered his judgment on the legal question involved in the case, viz., as to the rlght of the plaintiffs to recover, under the circumstances, at law on the contract. Mr. Malins, Mr. Collier, of the common law bar, and Mr. Karslake for plaintiffs; Mr. Bacon, Mr. Knowles, of the common law bar, Mr. Hawkins, MIr. MUilward, of the common law bar, and Mr. Rowoliffe for the defendants. Mr. Justice ERLE.-TO the question of his Honour the Vice-Chancellor, whether upon the terms of the contract and the evidence of the course of conduct of the parties to the contract in regard to the execution of the works the case is one in which if tried at law the jury would be directed to find a verdict for the plaintlffs, my answer is in the negative. I think there Is no evidence to support a claim by the plain. tiffs to recover anything in respect either of the work done and the materials suppned before the 28th of February, 1855, or of the plant taken by the defendants on that day, when the contract was lawfully determined. The question refers to the contract and to the course of conduct of the parties thereto, and I would propose to consider, first, the rights under the contract, and secondly the effect of the conduct of the parties. By the contract it appears to me that the engineer is interposed between the corporation and the contractors and made the absolute judge of the per. formance of the works, and that there Is no right in the con. tractor to demand payment and no liabilltv on the corporation to pay throughout the contract unless the condition of obtaining a valuation by the engineer and his certificate has been fulflled, I pass overwith the mere mention the clauses givingto the engineerhispowers in respectof the works, such as the absolute discretion over alterations and additions, and the valuations of them, and the powers to inspect and reject materlals and workmanship, and to suspend or delay the progress of any part of the works and to settle about the extension of time; and I come to the clauses regulating the contractors' right to demand payment. The parties provide, first, for paying instalments during the profress of the works, and the balance on the final completion ; and, secondly, for compensating for the work and the plant taken, in case the contract should be terminated before completion. In the first case, that is if the works progress to completion, then the stipulation for the certificate is ex. press. In paragraph 34, it is provided "That no sum or sums of money shall be considered to be due and owing, nor shall the contractor make any claim against or demand upon the said corporation for or on account of any work executed by him unless the said engineer shall certify the amount thereof and that the said contractor is reasonably entitled to such Instalment or balance respectively." This clause comprises every right to payment, except in case of termination of the contract, and makes every right universally conditional upon obtaining the engineer's certificate. Then, with respect to the clauses for determining the contract, in paragraph 33 it is provided" That, if the contraotoi s should not, in the opinion and according to the determination of the engineer, exercise due diligence as there described, the corporation may determine the contract and enter on the works and take possession of the plant of the contractors as the absolute property of the corporation." Then follows the express provision defining the rights of the parties in respect of such work and such plant:-" When the contract shall have been so terminated, or as soon thereafter as the engineer may think convenient, the engineer shall fix and determine what amount, if any, is reasonably earned by the contractor in respect to work actually done, and in respect to the value of any materials, implements, and tools (that is plant) provided by the contractor and taken to by the corporation; and the amount thereof, after allowing for all sums then already pid to the contractor, shall remain in the hands of the corporation until 12 months after the date of the engineer's certificate of the final completion of the works, d the engneer may by his certfieate authorize deductions therefrom ror losses and forfeitures." Thus the contractors stipulate that the corporaton shall be liable only to the amount which theengineer shallfixfor work done and plant taken at the termination of the oontract, liable, therefore, to nothing until an amount is so fixed, and then only sub. ject to the term for the deductions and the delay above specified. The contract gave to the corporation the right to terminate, and made it hable to mazke the payments in tha manuer specified. The contract also made the cont'actors liable to such a termination, and gavo to them the right to the payments in the manner specified. The coan tract expressly defines the rights of the parties in the event that hras happened, and the law can only enforce rights under a contract according to that contract. It is not necessary to cite authorities on such a point. I refer only to some of those cited in the argument. In "Grafton v. Eastern Counties Railway Company" (8 Exch.), the contract was to deliver to the satistaction of the agent of the defendants It was held that the promise was en condition that the agent was satisfied, and that no action lay for the price of the coke unless the condition were fulfilled. So in " Milner v. Field (8 Exch. 589), the same point prevailed. In "R anger v. Great Western Railway Company" (5 House of Lords' Cues, 73), tho stipulation that the engineer shoutd be the absolute judge during the progress of the works of the mode in which the contractor was discharging his dutlies was recognized both as valid and reasonable, though the engeer was a bbareholder in the oompany- and, in p p. 10617 the notion that accounts of the worl done under a similar'contract to this might be taken by the Master in Chancery instead of the engineer, on the ground that the contract had been abandoned, was repudiated as erroneous. The stipalation is of great importance. for, if the contractors can open this contract on account of alterations and additions with mutual disputes, and can insist that an account should now be taken before a stranger of the entire works, which can iU be examined after completion, they may inflict ltigation complicated, expensive, and doubtfol in the extreme, an evil which the stipulation is framed to avert. The question remains whether the conduct of the parties affords arny evidence of a right of action, either on the ground of waving the conditions or of departing from the original contract, and substituting -nother either expressed or implied, or on the ground of a wrong. My answer is in the negative. I am not aware that the defendants are shown to have committed any wrong or any breach of their con. tract, or any departure from it. The complaints of the plaintiffs against the engineer in respect of the extension of the time and of vexatious delays, and of withholding certificates for payment, and the lke, relate all of them to matters left to the discretion of the engineer by the contract, and if the engineer was unsatisfactory to the plaintiffs it was no breach of contract. At the same time it should be observed that the evidence on the other side is at least equally stronag to show that the plaintiffs were wanting in ability for the contract, and that the engineer did his duty to the corporation in resisting them. I take the result of the evidence to be that the engineer was and is able and willing to do all the duties imposed on him by the contract, and not incapacitated by colusion, oorruption, or otherwise. It is possible that the plaintiffs object to his arbitration, because he knows the truth and would decide according to it; but be this at it may, I cannot discover that the corporation have by their conduct created a liabilty at law not imposed on them by the terms of the contract. My answer thus far rests on the contract to pay being conditional, and is entirely independent of the clauce for referring all disputes and differences to the final arbitration of the engineer. If the defendants resorted to that clause, it appears to me to express an intention both to refer to the engineer the matters there mentioned, and to exclude other tribunals; and, although there are cases against giving effect to the latter part of such an intention, yet later decisions have limited that doctrine. In " Scott v. Avery" (5 House of Lords' Cases), such a reference was held to bind to the extent of the inatrament then in question. In " LUlin4to: v. RaUi" (Q. B.), an action was maintained for refusing to fulfil such an agreement to refer. These decisions are an authority for holding that an agreement to refer a question of amount and to exclade the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals till the award should be made would be v?lid. Now, the question between these parties is a question of amount-that is, of the amount due for works and materials and plant, the pblantiffs wishing to have that amount ascertained by a court, the defendants by the arbitrator named in the contract. I therefore incline to think that the defendants could, if necessary, mako a further valid defence to an action for this amount in the arbitration The VIcE-CH&AcELLo. said, he desired to express his obligations to Mr. Justice Erle for the great assistance he had given him by the able judgment he had just delivered, and which satisfied him (the Vice-Chancelor) that the plaintiffs had no right to recover at law; but that left untouched the more embarrassing question whether they were entitled to relief in a court of equity, and on this question he must reserve his judgment. (Before Vice-Chancdlor Sir- W. P. WooD,) IN THE NATrTER OF THE LONDO2; AND EASTERN BANKING CORPORATION. Mr. HETMLERINGTON applied to the Court that the question of the appointment of an official manaer in the winding up of the above mentioned company might be discussed in open court with the assistance of counsel, rather than in chambers. Mr. CAIRNS, for some of the shareholders, objected to the moatter being taken in open court. His clients had no wish to attend by counsel in chambers, and objected to the delay which would be occasioned. After some discussion his HoNouR. said, that the matter must be moved as an adjourned summons from Chambers on the next seal day (the 16th inst.) in ordinary course with the other motions. It would not be specially placed in the paper. LAWRIE V. BA&NES. This was a petition by Messrs. Edward and Maurice Cane, army agents in Ireland, for payment of a sum of 16., due to them for regimental stoppages upon the sale of the commission of the defendant H. G. E. Bankes, a oornet in Her Majesty's 4th Dragoon Guards. In October 1853, Mr. Bankes, then a minor, obtained a commission, by purchase, in the 4th Dragoon Guards, then stationed in Ireland, the petitioners being the Irish agents for the regiment, and during that period accountable for aU subscriptions of officers to the band and mess funds, &c., and generaUy for what are caUed regimental stopVpages. It was the custom of the petitioners and other Irish army to cash the daughts of the officers on the EuglishL agent of the regiment, these sums being considered as regi mental debts. In December, 1854, Mr. Bankes drew upon the petitioners for various sums, amounting altogether to 1301. In January, 1854, permission was granted for the sale of his commission, which was accordingly effected for 8401. The sum claimed by the petitioners from Mr. Bankes for regimental stoppages and debts amounted at the time of the sale of his commission to 1581. 3s. 5d. By the Queen's regulations the agents for any regiment are entitled to d.educt from the money in the hands of such agent be. longing to any officer of such regiment the amount due from such officer for regimental stoppages and debts,whethersuch officer is or is not a minor and without any necessity for his consent or concurrence. Subsequently to the sale of the commission Mr. Bankes had written to Mr. Lawrie, the London agent of the regiment, requesting him to pay to the petitioners, out of the proceeds of the commission In his hands, the amount due to them. The proceeds of the commission had been claimed, however, by the trustees of Lord Eldon's will, on the ground that the money originaly advanced for the purchase of Mr. Bankes' commission was trust money, and that the proceeds reverted to the purposes of the trust, Mr. Bankes being still a minor. Mr. I.awrie had filed an interpleader bill in reference to tho money in his hands iu consequence of the conflicting claims raised by the trustees, Bankes and the petitioners claiming under him. The money had been paid into court under an order made in the interpleader suit, and a etition was now presented by Messrs. Cane for payment ofrthe 1581. due to them for regimental stoppages. MIr. Baukes had also presented a petition, but this was ordered to stand over for the purpose of answering some affidavits very recently filed. Mr. Willcock and MIr. Bromehead appeared for the petitioners; IMr. Cairns and Mr. R. Hawkin for the respondens The VICE-CHANCELLOR held that, as the trustees had paid over the money for the purchase of the commission, and thereby enabled Mr. Banke8 to obtain credit for these sums w,ith the petitoners, they, as the army agents, could not be deprived of the right accruing to them under the Queen's regulations for the army. The sum claimed by the pehtitoners must be paid to them out of the residue of the fund in court, after taxing the costs of all parties.
COURT OF QIUEEN'S BENCH, GILDHALL, DEC. 11. I WESTLAKE AND ANOTHER V. 7iTAFVA\n A%a A--. (siMUtngs at Ni&i Prius, before Lord CAiXBELL and Special Juries.) Mr. Maculay and Mr. J. Brown were counsel forthe alaintiffs; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Woods appeared for the defendants. This was an action on a charterparty. The plaintiffs are owners of the ship Washington, and in July, 1851, she was chartered by Mr. W. 0. Young on behalf of the de. fendants, Messrs. Matheson and Co., for a voyage to ManiUa with a cargo of coals and two boilers for the steam. ship Juno, the property of the defendants. The charter contained a clause, "goods to be brought to and taken from alongside at charterer's expense and risk." After the charterparty was signed an endorsement was put on it, signed by Mr. Young, " boilers to be taken out by charterer's agents and consignoes at their expense and risk." The ship sailed in September, and arrived at Manila in March, 1852; on the 12th the captain gave notice to the consignees, Messrs. Barrett and Co., that the boilers were ready to be taken out. They repUed that according to the charterparty the captain was bound to do so, and caUed on him to take the ship up the river to the shears for the purpose. They stated there was no endorsement on their copy of the charterparty. After some negotiation the captain did so under protest. Be was not finally discharged until the 22d of April, and the action was brougbt to recover demurrage for the delay The question in dispute was whether the endorsement was by defendant's authority. Mr. Young states he had no such authority. He told the captain that he should have the use of the Juno's shears and tackle, and directed his olerk to give a memorandum to that effect. He signed the endorsement without reading it. Lord CAMPBELL said, there was no evidence of any authority. The plaintiffs were then nonsuited. YARINA V. SILVERLOCK. Sir F. Kelly, Mr. Daniel (of the Chancery bar), Mr. B. James, and Mlr. Qnain were counsel for the plaintiff, Sir F.Thesiger, Mr. Temple, Mfr. Lush, Mr. Unthank, and Mr. Bruxton (of the Chancery bar), appeared for the defen. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff is the celebrated manufaoturer of Ean de Cologne; that he was In the habit of affixing to his bottles a particular kind of label which constituted his trade mark; and that the defendant, the printer in Doctor's-commons, had printed and sold copies of his labelr. The defendant pleaded "Not Guilty," and that the labels did not constitute a trade mark of the plaintiff. Sir P. KzLnLY stated that the anoestor of the plaintiff went to Cologne in the year 1709, and established hlimeelf as a dealer in Italian articles. Some time after heinventedtho Eecret of the perfume. The business had sinoe continued in the family, and the aecret wua handed down from father to SoD, for generations, and wa known only to one or two members of the family at a time. The eecret Wa comnMunicatedtothle lAntiffin 1835 and he became a partner in the firm in 1841 The ihbel which the defendant was charged with imitating had been adopted by the firm in 1832. SInce then spurious Eau de Cologne had been sold with labels so closely resembling the plaintiff's as to deceive the public. Sinoe 1846 he had established his right in no less than 11 case On the plaintiff's label was the n)ame "Johann Maria Farina," andunder it, "GegenuUjr dens Julich8 Plaet," with a flourish underneath; in the corner was a shield with the Prussian Eagle and a flowerpot; round the seal the inscription I'gegen," &c., was agafin repeated with the plaintiff's initials and "a&n. eye" in the centre. On the 11abl printed by the defendant the name and in. scription were the same. There was a alight difference in the flourish and some strokes and dots by which it was ornamented. There was also a slight differenoe in the shield in the oorner and in the seal. The plaintiff applied to the Court of Chancery to restrain the defendant. Vice-Chancellor Wood granted an injunction, but it was afterwards diisolved by the Lord Chancellor, who suspended the bMll until the plaintiff should bring this action. The Lord Chancellor, in the couse of his judgment, said, it was clear that a peron who had adopted a particular mark to designate his manufactures had a right to prevent auy person from selling any article marked in such a way as to make the public believe that it was hi. There was, however, another view of the case which did not appear to be present to the Vioe.Chanoellorgs mind, that a trader who had some of the genuine Eau de Culogne of the plaintiff, buthad not any of hisalabels, mightget aprinterto print some for him, and he conld not bepuniahed, as the plaintiff had no copyright in it, With all respect for the Lord Chanoellor he (Sir F. Kelly) should contest that doctrine; the defendant had no right to sell these labels, and if his intention was such, as he alleged, he would have made an exact copy of the plaintiffr., and not a colourable imitation. The Lord Chancellor held that if the labels printed by the defendant were sold to persons, who might a ply them to lawful puroes, thers was no ground of oomplaint, if he sold them to persons without further inquiry. He (Sir F. Kelly) would show that the pretence of the de. fendant was mere moonshine, and that there never was an instance in the last 25 years of a single label being lost or worn out, except once, about ten year ago,when a quantity coming to London were damaged on oard ship. Mr. J. M. Farina, the plaintiff, was then called. Be stated that the label now used had been designed by his father. He sold about half a million bottles in the year, and never sold any except In bottles. The labels were printed at Cologne, and he had never given permision to have them printed elsewhere. He never supplied the labels separately to any person except in the one case mentioned. Cross-examined.-There are about 30 firms of the name of Farina carrying on business in Cologne; about 21 use the name Johann 3aia Farina. There is a Mr. Aldenbrach carries on busness in Julch's Platz, under the name Johann Maria Farina. Before 1832 his house used no labels at all, nor did any other house. They sent about 200,000 bottles a-year to Enugland. They used five different kinds of bottles. The label used by M. Aldeubruch had a resemblance to his, To Sir F. KBLIY.-There are only two persons besides himself nhaimed Farina in business at Cologne; one isa re. If. Langelman had been agent to the plaintiff for some years. He knew there was a ecret In the manufacture. The words "gegen uler," &o., on the labels were the only means of ascertaining the genuine articles. They became known as the trade mark. On one occaion he found a Mr. Shaw had printed these labels, and proceedings were taken against him. Proceedings were taken in several cther cases against persons uinng imitation labels on a spurious aricle. Evidence was given that no bottle was ever sent out by the plaintiff without a labe, and that it formed the distingMuiing mark; and that in no instance had the labels come off so as to render it necessary for any dealer to apply to a printer to supply them. Several persons engaged in business as chymists and perfumers were called on to prove that they were in the habit of manufaoturing Ean de Cologne and seling it with Farina labels obtained from the defendant. Sir F. TsiGsimx then proceeded to address the jury for the defendant, but had not concluded his address when the Court rose. SATURDAY, DEC. 12. (SiUing] at Nii Pris, before Lord CA,iPBELL and Special T&ri.a-) PARINA V. SILVERLOCK Sir F. THSIGE proceeded to address the jury for the defendant. He contended that this was a very harsh proceedingagainst Mr. Silverlock, who had sold these labels without question for over 30 years. The plaintiff had sworn that his label was invented in 1832, but long before that labels exactly similar to those printed by the defendant had been used by the other person named Farina esta. blished at Cologne. In that year the plaintiff adopted his label, which only dlffered from that formerly in use in the posltion of some rt:okes and dots about the flourish. He (Sir F. Thesiger) admitted that, if the use of a label had been first introduced by plaintiff in 1832 as a trade mark, it could not be denied that the defendant's was a colourable imitation, but, so far from that being the case, he would show that the original blocks of the defendant's labels had been purchased from a Mrs. Cox, the widow of Mr. Cox, a printer, who had used them for 50 years, and it was Important to remember that there was no proof of the defendant's having ever sold any exact facsiniles of the plaintiff's labels. He admitted that a person who had established a right to a particular trade mark was entitled to maintain an action against any person vending a spurious article under his mark, and also against a printer ,who printed labels for that purpose; but to maintain an retion against the prlnter It was essential to show that he bad printed and sold them with a fraudulent intention. Lord CAIepBELL apprehended that the defence was that the defendant had printed these particular labels before the I laintiff had established his trade mark, and had since sold r o other. Sir F. THESIGHE said that was his case; he did not in. tend to defend the fraud of those parties who had very glibly stated they had sold their own manufactureunder these labels, but the defendant had nothing to do with their conduct. He had no intention that these labels should be used dishonestly. Lord CAJMPBELL supposed Mr. Silverlock had no wish to continue the proceeding complained of. Sir F. TxSIGER said, he had not printed a single one since the proceedings commenced, but be was forced to come and defend himself against the charge of fraud. From 1832 to 1857 he had only printed 6,725 of the three kinds of Farina labels, and the profit from 1832 to 1857 was not 40s. Under snch circumstances, of course it would not have been worth the defendant's while to defend these proceedings, but he ws anxions to defend himself from the charges made against him. Air. Henry Silverlock, the defendant, stated that he had been in business since 1828, and in that year he bought a quantity of these labels from a Mrs. Cox,whose husband had been in business for many years; he continued to buy the labels up to 1846, when he purchased the blocks from Mrs. Cox's representatives, with her stock in trade. He had never printed any other kind of these labels. He first leerned In 1833 that there -were a number of Farinas in Cologne. The plaintiff appears in the Cologne Directory of that year, but he had no idea that he claimed the label as a trade mark. His first intimation was the notice of action in 1855. He went to Cologne in 1853, on the occasion of Mr.h Benfield'sbelng threatenedwith proceedings by a Johann MIaria Farina, 31, New Market; he called on that person, and afterwards walilng about he saw the names of a vast number of Farinas. Until the biUl was filed he had no idea that any person claimed the label printed by him as a trade mark. Cross examined.-He had sold small quantities of labels which could only be intended to reDlace originals that had been lost; that did not make him think the label was a trade mark. He could not swear that there was a single entry in his book of any Eau de Cologne labels before 1832. He did not know until lately that Shaw had been proceeded against. He had not printed any for four or five years. Some witnesses were then called to prove that labels similar to those of defendant's had been printed and sold by MIrs. Coxc and others for many years. hlr. Orndge stated that he had more than once purchased labels from the defendant to replace those of the plaintiff, w hich had been damaged or dirtied. Sir F. TH};SIGEB and MIr. E. JAIEs addressed the jury on behalf of their respective clients. Lord CAL PABLL said, it seemed to him that the plaintiff had made out a very strong case; it was for the jury to consider whether a sufficient answer had been given to it, but he could not see how the right to a trade mark could be established unless the plaintiff had establshed his in this case. The question was whether the defendant had done anything to subject himself to an action for the use of it. He had for a number of years engraved and sold to dealers a number of labels so closely resembling the genuine ones as to be a colourable imitation; the attempt was a very futile one which had been made to show that he had sold these labels under the belief that they were to be used only for the purpose of replacing genuine ones which had fallen off. He (Lord Campbell) considered there was evidence for them that Mr. Silverlock knew this was a trade mark, and that he sold them without the consent of the owner; if so the owner had a remedy, not only against the person using them, but also against the printer. The answer, however, set up to7 the action was a very serious one, and he was of opinion, in point of law, that if the trade mark published by the defendant was known before 1832 and sold and circulated in this country, and the defendant had only engraved that which was before in circulation, and had no notice that it was the trade mark of the plaintiff Johann Maria Farina, the action was not maintainable, and if so the defendant was guilty not only of no moral fraud, bht not even of legal fraud. It was for the jury to consider whether the answer of the defendant was made out to their satisfaction. The jury then retired, and after a short absence returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 40s. FRIDAY, DrC, 1L SECOND COURT. (Before Mr. Justicc ERLE and Common T7wics.) ALLDAY V. COITRELL. Mr. Huddleston and Mr. ]Kennedy were connsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Sldnner and Mr. Welsby appeared for ths defendant. This was an action against an attorney for negligence, From the evidence for the plaintiff it appeared that he is a wre maker at Birmingham. In Decomber, 1855, he was at Nantwich fair, in Cheshire. During his stay his pocket was picked of 501. He communicated writh the li ce but they could obtain no clue to the offenders. After h return to Birmingham, however, ho received a tolegraphio commnunication from the police to the effect that a man names James Shufflebottom, a travelingn tinker, had been arrested on suspicion, and requiring his attendance. Hae proceded to Nantwlich, but did not appear before the mastrates, so the prisoner was discharged. He at onOO oommenoed an aotion against the present plaintiff for false imprisonment, malicious Rrosecutlon, and slander. The plaintiff; who was described as A very nervous per. son and much averse to law, was greatly alarmed, and at once requested his attorney, Mr. Cottrell, the present defendant, to do all he could to settle the aotion, He, how.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. DEc. 11. BOTTOMLEY V. SAUNDF.TLS. (SiUiings at Nisi Prius, at Gauidhall, Wcore Chief .Justice COCKBUIRN and a S7veiat Juam1. I nir. uoLuer, QX..., Mr. Prentice, and Mr. Pearce appeared or the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Payne were bunsel for the defendant. This was an actlon to recover damages for false imprison. ment, brought by the plaintiff against the defendant, under the following circumstances:- The plaintiff, who on cross-examination described himself as a dealer in pigs, hoses. greens, potatoes, harness, and old carts, was endeavouring on the 9th of October to dispose of a cart-horse in Smithfield New Cattle-market, when a person named Ryan, baUiff to the defendant, went up to nim with a policeman in plain clothes, and asked him what he wanted forthe animal. T1he plaintiffsaid 151. He alsostated that he had bonght it at Stourbridge fair, and that it was the same age as other peoplo's horses. TJpon this Ryan said, "This is a stolen horse, and here is a policeman." The plaintiff then said, "I wish you. had told me this before, for I should not then have told you any lies. I was anxioas to seUl my horse, and thought you would rather have a country horse, but I bought It at Rea's Repository." Plaintiff then asked them to take him to Rea's, but they insisted upon his going with them to the police station at Totten. ham, where be -vas charged 'with having stolen a horse, locked up in a cell, taken before a magistrate at the Angel Inn at Edmonton, and after twvo remands discharged. The defence was that on the 4th or oth of October a horse and mare belonging to the defendant, who is the rector of St. Luke's, Old-street, and who farms his glebe land at Tottenham, had been stolen from the marshes near that village; that on the 9th of the same month the plaintiff was fouand in possession of the identical horse; and that, having made several false representations respecting it the defendant was 2ustified In gving him into custody. It was proved most clearly that a friend of the plaintiff, named Gosden, had bought the horse, which together with the stolen mare, had been sent to Rea's Repository as coming from one George Smith, of EIatfield, to be sold; that the plaintiff had afterwards boght him at " a knock-out," held between Goaden, who is a livery-8tablekeeper, Saunders, who is a potato-dealer, and himself; and that he had given 3s. 6id. to each of these men, besides paying tbe sutm at which the horse was sold to Gosdennamely, 61. los.; but it was shown on the part of the defendant that when Byan, his bailiff, accosted the plaintiff in the cattle-market he had. not only said that he had' bought the horse at Stoarbridge, hut had also stated that he had seen him work on a farm, and that he was not eight years old, the mark only just being out of bis mouth, besides makling various other false statements. IIr. Saunders, wvho was examined as a witness, dented most strenuously that he had authorized the arrest of the plaintiff, but after some pressing admitted that he was the prosectator, and that Mr. Payne, the barrister, had appeared against Bottomley, when before the magistrate on remand, at his (the defendant's) request, and on his retainer. The trlal of this cause lasted during the whole of the day, sand eventusily the jury found that the defendant had reaSeeable grounds for giving the platu.tiff into custody. This, Sbbject to any motion which may be made in the court in iQnur, is a verdict for the defendant;* but may be more technically and correctly statbd as being a general one for the dhefendant, the question of reasonable cause being one for SECOND COURT. (Befor'e Ms'. Justice CRESSWxLL and a Common Jury.) rABRRRs V. InnE'rSON. MIr. Serjeant Piggott and Mfr. VaugiaanWllllarms appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. H. Hill, Q.

The plaintiff In this oase sued for damages for a wrongful dimsaL It appeared that he had been engaged as traveller to the defendant at a salary of 1501. a- ear, and that te had been dismissed with a month's notice. T'This he said was not sufficient, and the question was whether a custom prevailed in the Manohester trade to dismiss travellers at so short a notice. Tbe jury found tbat such a custom existed, but that the hiring of the plaintiff was a contract of such a nature as that it did not apply. Verdict for the plsintiff-Damages. 701. SATsRDAsY, DEc. 12. (SiUings at Nisi Prin, at Guildhall, before C07ief Justice CoCmIBuRNu and a Special Jury.) The Court having with a common jury disposed of the part-heard case of Tripp v. Jay, which was an action for an alleged eviction, and which resulted in a verdict for the defendant, and also of an undefended cause, proceeded to the hearing of the special jury case of GODDEN V. IASAISAN, in wbich Mr. Lush, Q.C., and Mr. Turner appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Prentice for the defendant. This was an faction for lIbel with a plea of justification - but as at the rising of the Court the further hearing of the cmse was adjourned to Monday, we reserve our report. SECOND COURT. (Before Mr. Jusitce CRESWELL and a Common Jury.) BROWN V. THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY COMPANY. Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Hugh Hill, Q.C., and Mr. Petersdorff were counsel for the defeDdants. This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for injuries sustained by him while traveling on the line of railway between Spa-road and Greenwich, on the night of the 30th of October, 1856, on which evening a mosa serious collision took place between two trains moving In opposite directions, and meeting on the same line o rails. The defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had as. cepted a sum of 61. in satisfaction and discharge of all claim for compensation in respect of the injuries sustained by himn. Mr. James baving opened the case for the plaintiff, called Timothy Brown.-I am the plaintiff in this case. In October, 1856, I was the holder of a second-class season ticket on the defendants' line; on the night of the 30th of October I was travelling on that line; when near Deptford a collision took place by our train meeting another; I was thrown on the bottomn of the carrage senseless. I had afterwardspain in my back, my face, my hip, knee, and leg my hat was broken, and my coat to I. I gout and walked with the guard a quarter of a mile for assistance. On my return I felt faint. I got home and had a bad night. I went to my business the next day. I am a cork manufacturer. I caUed in Mr. Bodkin, my urogeon. I suffered much. A doctor caDed on me on the 4th of November; he said he was Mr. Adams, from the company; that I had had a slight conta. sion ; that he wanted the matter settled; and that 51. would pay for my coat; he said also that he would pay my medical expenses; he gave me a check for 61. and Ifigneu a receipt. I can hardly call to mind all that passed, I was so coniused and ancertain, this state exists still. The same evening I tried to write to Mr. Adams * I could not do so without help. The next day I sent a letter to Mr. Adams. he letter was here read, and in it Mr. Brown stated that le had been so taken by surprise by Mr. Adams that he probably should have accepted even the tithe of what he had if it had been offered, and that his injuries were se. rious. On the 7th of November I received a letter from Mr. Eborall, the manager of the railway, stating that I had been sufficiently compensated. I saw him afterwards- he said the medical officer had done me justice, but that he would direct him to call on me again. He never did call sgain. I have been obliged to go out of town and have incurred expenses. [Mr. Hill here objected that no evidence of what had been spent since the 'writ was issued in January last was admissible.] Oross-examined.-I sent an account of the accident to the Sar newspaper the next day. I stated that I had fortunately escaped with a few bruises, but I added that I had sustained an internal injury. The witness was also crossexamined as to what he said and did on the interview with Mr. Adams, but nothing of any importance was elicited. Re-examined.-Mr. Templar assisted me in writing the letter to Mr. Adams and also the account in the Star, and, indeed, in everything I did and wrote. - Templar.-I am a cork cutter in the employ of- the plaintiffi Mr. Brown came into the warehouse on the day after the accident in a weak state. Hle was assisted by the conductor of the omnibus. He could scarcely move, and had a wild look. He has never been the man he was before the collision. I have seen his hands and arms paralyzed three or four times a-day. His memory is not what it was. I corrected his letter-the words were misplaced. After Mr. Adams had left him he was aU in a shake. This witness gave a full account of the symptoms displayed by the plaintiff since the aceident, and was confirmed in his evidence by Caroline Sims, who is in Mr. Brown's employ; and by Mr. Carling, a house agent, who had had business transactions with him. Mr. Bodkin, a surgeon at Bermondsey, and Mr. Hall, a surgeon at lorselydown, stated that the nervous system of the plaintiff had received a violent shook, that he was partially paralyzed, that his spine was injured, and that he was not likely ever to be permanently better. Mr. HUGH HILL then addressed the jury, and relied mainly upon the contract made with Mr. Adams, whom he called. John Adams.-I am one of the senior surgeons to theILondon Hospital, and am also surgeon to the company. I called on Ihe plaintiff, and said, I I am come to see you about the coUllon near Deptford." I asked what injury he had sustained, and said I had come to offer compensation. He said, "In the first place, my coat is torn." I aid, "WDi a sovereign do for that ?" ie said, IYes." I said, "What is your personalinjury P" e said, "Iam bruised in the side." I said, "What shrll I give youforthat,-5U.I and the payment of your medical expenses ?" He said, " Yes." I wrote a check for 61. He crossed it, and at my request signed a receipt. He walked with me to the door, andpointed out my way to Bermondsey-street. He was perfectly self ossessed and knew what he was doing. Cross-examm~sed by hlr. HAwRcs.-My first duty is to see patients and then o settle with them. I do notexamine them excepting inserious cases. Ihave endeavouredtomake bargainswithsickpersonsin bed, but, to the best of my belief, never exceptin thepresenceof theirmedical man. Mr. Brown said Mr. Bodkin had attended him. I took no trouble to ascertain the extent of the injury in his side. My vieit lasted 10 minutes. It was a very serious accident; one had his leg broken, one his jaw fractured, one his nasal bone broken ; many were hurt. I do not know how many bar. gains I made. I carry a bundle of receipts about, and I assure you it Is a very laborious task. Re-examined.-Brown's seemed a slight case. The stationmaster at Deptford was called to prove that the plaintiff, after the collision, said that he was more frightened than hurt, and that he walked to Greenwich and back again, a distance of a quarter of a mile, and then, feel. ing faint, went home. This was the defendant's case. A letter from Mr. Eborall, stating that as a settlement with Mr. Brown had been effected in a liberal spirit the directors did not feel disposed to reopen the question, was readl on behalf of the plaintiff, and Mr. PTrxnsDoBFF (in the absence of Mr. Hill) having summed up the evidence, Mr. HAKVINS (in the absence of Mr. James) replied on the whole case. The learned JUDGE then carefully wvent through the facts deposed to, and left it to the jury to say whether when the plaintiff signed the receipt and accepted the check, he was in a fit state to make a contract. After some consideration the jury retired, and eventually found a verdict for the defendants. IRIBBERT V. POTTER. While the officer of the court was calling a fresh jury for the trial of tbLs cause the counsel engaged to conduct it requested the ;earned judge to dispose of it without the intervention of the customaryg 12 good men." Mr. Justice CRESSIVELL.-I would much rather not. I have only known of three cases in which causes have been tried by the judge without a jury, and they have all turned out falutres. However, being pressed to adopt this course, the learned Judge consented, and the case proceeded. It proved to be an action on the warranty of a horse, and possessed no pointq oi interest, the main question being one of agency. Verdict for the plaintiff.
COURT OF EXMUTROTRIR n-r i, POOLE V. THE NATIONAL P'ROVINCIL FIRE - A(' Vtulvngs at NiftiPrius, at Ouirdhall, 'before .fr. Baron B3RA2UMVXLL and -nr- r,; - %e a,r. oer3eant r'arry and Mr. Geary were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Turner were counsel | for the defendants. This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages for being wrongfully dtsmissed from the office of assessor of fires to the defendants, and to recover certain moneys claimed ascommission and as salary for discharging tho duty of director of the c.ompany. The defendants pleaded, as did the "Life Society," who were the defendants in another action tried yesterday at the suit of Mr. Poole, that the contract under which the plaintiff's claim chiefly arose had not been confirmed by the shareholders. They also contended that no allowance of any salary to the directors had been made by the company, as was required by their deed of settlement; and, as to other portions of the claim, they contended that the plaintiff bad accepted 1251. in full of his demand, and that his services, which extended over a period short of three months, were adequately remunerated thereby. After a tedious trial, Mr. Baron BRAMIWELL ruled various points raised by the defendanWts counsel in their favour, but took the opinion of the jury as to the sufficiency of the sum paid to the plaintiff. The jury found upon this point in favour of the defendants, and a verdict was thereupon taken generally for the defendants, subject to the opinion of the Court above on the points ruled and reserved by the learned judge. Verdict for the defendants accordingly. FRANKLIN V. THE SOUYTHI-EASTERN RAILWAY CO'IPANY. Mr. M. Chambers and Mr. Francis were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. O'MaUey and Mr. Petersdorff appeared for the defendants. This was an action by the plaintiff as administrator of his son, who was kiUed in the weIl known accident on the defendants' line of railway at Lewisham. The negligence was admitted on the part of the company, and the only question was the amount of damage to which the plaintiff was entitled In consequence of the death of his son. It appeared that the plaintiff was and is the night porter of St. Thom,is Hospltal, where he also discharged other duties, such as carryingz coals and attending to the engines, for which he received 3s. 6d. per week. The deceased was about 21, and was in the employ of a saddler at one guinea a-week, and with 3s. from another quarter; and during the last two years or so of his life he had assisted bis fatber, free of charge, in cazrring the coals. He aiso made presents to both his parents occasionally, and dined with them on Sund ys. when he always paid for his mal The plaintiff proved that since his son's death he haa lost the 3s. 6d. per week, and had expended Ill. los. in burying him, and other outlays consequent upon his death, in the shape of fees paid for lett,rs of administration and for moumning. Mr. O'MALLEY submitted, on these facts, that the case did not fall within the swope of Lord Campbell's Aot. Mr. Baron BRAsvELL seemed to doubt whether any case had been made out, but suggested that the opinion of the jury might be taken as to the question whether there -was any loss of pecuniary advantage sustained by the plaintiff which, but for his son's sudden death, he might reasoniably have expected to receive from him. Mr. CsrAuBERs, in summing up the case to the jury, contended that there had been a clear weekly loss of 3s. 6d. sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the negligence of the defendants, and the jury were at liberty to adopt that sum as the basis of their calculation. M1r. O'MALLEY addressed the jury for the defendants, and contended that the loss of the offices rendered by the son and the presents given to the father did not constitute such damages as fell within the Act, which only contemplsted the loss of sums which the party for whose benefit this sort of action was oreated by that enactment could have enforced, or which, at all events, were something more than gratuities. Mr. Baron BRAMWELL, having left the question suggested by him to the jury, cautioning thom that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover anything by way of compensationL for injured feelings, The jury, after a brief deliberation, found for the plaintiff with 751. damages, subject, as we understood, to leave to move on the part of the defendants. SATURDAY, DEC. 12. (Sieirigs at 2Zisi Prius, at Gaidhal4 before Mr. Baron BRAMrVELL and SpeciW Juries.) The proceedings of this court to-day were not of a character to call for any detailed report.
IiMSOLVEVT DABTOR' COUBT, De 1L I _ N RE LORD GEORGE TOWNSHEND. (Before ahe Car CoiMUssIoinP) - -Kug Ox io=s case was resumed this morning. The insolvent was questioned respecting some copyhold land at Chiswick, in respect of which his name was entered upon the list of voters for the present year, but he disclaimed all knowledge of the property, although he admitted that he had once voted at an election in respect of that pro. perty, but on that occasion he was innorant that his name was on the register until a card was -sent to him soliciting his vote. Mr. LAWRENCE remarked that it was a serious offence to vote upon a qualification. which the party voting did not possess. The learned CoarassIONNE sald that was not a matter for this Court to inquire into. Mr. IAvRENCE then proceeded to address the Court on the part of the Chiswick creditors. He submitted that the debts had been incurred with the tradesmen he repre. sented in a most reckless manner, and under representations as to "rents" and "' dividends" which could not be justified, The Insolvent had gone to reside at Chiawick last November, when hopelessly insolvent, and had obtained necessities from the tradesmen at that place and hlis luxuries from creditors in London. There was a poor needlewoman at Chiswick who had opposed. It was not a case for any further protection. Mr. BAGLEY followed on the part of the Guernsey credltors, and complained of the dishonest conduct, as he termed it, of the insolvent, who in the disguise of a lord had vic. timized the tradesmen at that place; and when he set aside 2001. a-year, on leaving the island he revoked the authority after paying four quarterly sums. The learned counsel eulogized the conduct of Mr. Henderson, who had acted in the matter of the allowance as agent to the insolvent, and only regretted that his honourable conduct had not been adopted by the insolvent. He confidently submitted that it was not a case for protection. Mr. DoWSE, on the part of Messrs. Landon and Morland, tailors, contended that the debt had been incurred without any intention of payment; but If the Court should not come to that conclusion, It was quite clear that there were no rea. sonable expectations of payment. Mr. GRIFFITnsS addressed the Court on the part of Messrs. Dew and Weatherley, hesaers, of Cheapside, and urged that their debt had been Improperly contracted. A bricklayer named Wright, at Chiswick, opposed for a debt for work and for expenses in the County Court. The insolvent got protection from this Court just at the time he had obtained judgment. He said theinsolvent spoke to him about his rents and dividends. Mr. SARGOOD replied on the whole evidence and took each case 8ericim. He contended that there vere no grounds for charging the insolvent with having represented that he had rents or dividends to any of the creditors. He was anxious that he should be free from such a charge of fraud. The learned counsel admitted that he could not justify the number of debts the insolvent had inourred, nor could he pretend that he had reasonable expectatIons of paying them. He addressed himself to the peculiar circumstances in which Lord George was placed with the view of the learned Commissioner allowing him after a certain time to apply for a protecting order. lis (Mr. Sargood's) difficulty was Increased in the case when he considered the position of the insolvent and the high sense of honour with which the learned Commissioner viewed such transactions. The C=n s Co.snsrssioNxE said the case was a clear one, and a mere cursory inspection of the schedule was sufficient to show that the Coutrt was not empowered to grant further protection. It was the plainest proposition possible, that the Protection Acts were not intended for the relief of persons who deliberately lived beyond their means, and that had been the case with the gentleman who now applied for protection. He (the Commissioner) at once acquitted the insolvent of any kind of fraud, and even if when making excuses for non-payment he had referred to rents and div - dends, it had not been with any intention to defraud the creditors, for their debts were already incurred. However the simple facts were that the Insolvent, having been in diff. culties in Guernsey, had endeavoured tojarrange by pay. ment of 501.a-quarter,which was discontinued after fournay, ments had been made. He went to Chiswick in November, 186, owilng then something like 2,0001. Between Novev_her, 1S56, and the present time, he had received and expended 500., and had contracted 1,0001. of debts. The Court was not permitted to give immediate protection to a person who had deliberately exceeded his income, and in this case there could be no doubt that Lord George had done so. The case must therefore be adjourned sine die, but it was his (the Commissioner's) hope that he might never hesr of it again. The case was then adjourned sine die, the insolvent's protection not being renewed, and consequently his lordship was Arrested immediately upon quitting the court, SATURDIAY, DEC. 12. IN REs sRY JOH?N IONS. This insolvent, a marine storedealer, petitioned under tbe Protection Act. Mr. Way op sed. It appeared that complaint had been made of a nuisance upon the insolvent's premises, aring from a large coUection of bones, and his landlord being asous of abating the nuisance, withdrew a distraint which he had made for arrears of rent upon the ineolvent undertaling to give up the premises and pay the debt by instalments. When, however the landlord desired to obtain possession for a new tenant the insolvent refused to quit without being paid, and he stil rotained the premises without paying any rent Mr. WAY, for the landlord, asked for speedy possession The learned Commtissmosvss told the insoivent If he could not pay his rent he had no right to keep the landlord out of his property, and unless possession was given up by Wednesday next the petition would be dismissed.
WINTER ASSIZES. NORTHEPRN lTRPpTrTp LIVERPOOL, WEDNESDAY. DRr. Q. (Before Mr. Justice WjHTsxA-rA.) Andrew O'Brien was indicted for the murder of ElUtn Motineux, at Woolton, on the Ist of November last. Mr. Ovens and Mr. Scott prosecuted; Mr. Monk, Q.C., and Mfr. AsPinail defended the prisoner. Mr. OvxMs, on opening the case upon the part of the prosecution, stated the deceased Mrs. Molyneux, who was 66 years of age, was the widow of a person named Robeit Molyneur, who formerly resided in Liverpool. She was the mother-in-law of the prisoner at the bar, hehaving married her daughter in the year 1856. and in MArch of that year she went to reside at Much Woolton, a vilage about six mies from LIverpooL She took lodgings there in the house of respectable people named Moss. She rented one room, It vwas on the first floor, upstairs, and there were two windows in it, one factng Into the street and another into a garden at the side of the house. The prisoner was in the habit of frequently going out to Woolton to see his motherIn-law, and occasionally he used to sleep in the house. When he slept there he used the bed, and Mrs. Molynenu slept on the sofa. Matters thus went on till Friday, the 30th of last Ootober, and on that day, in the course of the afternoon, the prisoner went with his wife (Mrs. Molyneux's daughter) on a visit to the deceased at Much Woolton, and he remained there all Friday night, and on the Saturday afternoon his wifa left him and returned to Liverpool, he continuing there. Although he appeared to have been drinking when he first came, he was perfectly quiet. On Sunday morning, about 9 o'clock, Mrs.Molyneux came down. sartoMrs oss, and got a small quatitity of whisky to help the prisoner with his brekfast, and soon afterwards the prisoner was heard praying in a very loud tone, so mnuch so that he was distinctly audible by pe the street. The noise became so loud that Mr. Molyneux camae out of the room and begged Mrs. Mo to allo her to go into her room to say her prayers, o O'Brien" meanin theprisoner, "prayedso lod t he quiteannoyed he- "a7ding "'He's taken to praying, and I am ver glAd of int hottiete deceased again spke to Mrs. Moss, and equeted er Bo snd for Mr. Kars aw, the Catholic pret thth cih ome and see the prisoner.

In answer to Mr.Mss she also stated, " O'Brien Is comafortable, and sitting in his ar-chair." They then left the prisoner and the deceaed in the house alone, locking the door behind them. About a quarter to 3 o'clock in the afternoon a woman named Kay was going to the Roman Catholic chapel, and whenL she got near Mose~s house she heard a woman calling out-" 0 dear, 0 dear," two or three tlme% and she also heard t-he sound of wrestling. She crossed the bsrret, and found the sounds Prooeeded from the wludow of Mrs. Molyneux's room. The sounds gradualy died away and became fainterandmore feeble, and she then heard thesound of something being knocked against the floor or door. She vent to the house of a person called Walker, and told 'what she had heard; and then proceeded to the chapel. The next person who came was a Mrs. Gore, whose husband was the brother of Mrs. Molyneux, the deceased. She found the doors all fast. She went to the back door and knocked there, and there was no answer. She then went to the front door and knocked as loudly as possible, but stil there was no answer. She then went to the open window, and caled out as loudly as she could " Mrs. Molyneux I" two or three times, and still there was no answer. She then went to Walker's, a next-door neighbour's, and it seemed by that time some persons had gathered at Walker's door, among whom was Margaret Collins, who had come up at that time and heard the sound as of a heavy footstep on the floor of the room. They all went to the corner of the house, where they could see the window, and then they saw at the window the head and arms olf Mrs. Molyreux, covered with blood, hanging over the window sill, The prisoner shortly afterwards appeared at the window and drew the body hackc. A crowd ox persons soon collected, and arong them was Mr. Kershaw, who had come to the house for the purpose of seeing the prisoner a second time. MIr. Kershaw entered the house by burstinz open the door, acoompanied by two men named Gore and Green, and whenx they got to the top of the stairs they found a great quantity of blood on the lancding. It was not merely on the floor, but on the wainscot at either side of the door. They went into the room and saw the body of Mrs. Mfolyneux lying on the floor crouched up, and the prisoner bending over it with his hand under it, as if about to raise it up. Gore said to him, " Mr. O'Brien, what have you done?" and O'Brien's replywas, " I have done it." The prisoner appeared collected, and knew very well what ho was doing. 3r. Green apprehended the prisoner at once, and took him to the station-house. On examining the body of the deceased It was found that her head and neck were a mass of bruises, and the sumgeons would tell them there was enough violence on her head to cause death by concussion of the brain, and marks about the neck caused by strangulation. The cartilage of the windpipe was broken also, and there was no doubt great violence had been used. On examining the premises they found in the cupboard a bottle with a small quantity of whisky In it, and on the chimney. piece a mug with a little whisky in it. With a key that was found in the deceased's pocket they opened the upper drawer of a chest of drawers in the room, and in it they found an I 0 U in the handwriting of the prisoner for the sum of 00L. It was dated the 30th of September last, and he should prove that on the 31st of October (there was no doubt a mistake In the date of the I U () the deceased drew out of the bank some 290g. to pay to the prisoner. The prisoner was taken to the station and immediately after being taken there he was seen by Mr. Cross, the surgeon of the village, who conversed with the prisoner. Mr. Cross would tell them that the prisoner appeared collected, and to know perfectly well what he was doing, and his aunswers to the questions were just the answers a rational man would give. Some time after, in consequence of Superintendent Green sending for him, Mr. Fowler came down, and he sent in another surgeon,Mr. Rigg; Mr. Rigg and Mr. Cross afterwards saw the prisoner in the evening. At that time they saw the prisoner seated in his celL He had his hands down before him, clasped together, his head thrown back, and his eyes fixed on the ceiling. Be preserved silence, and would not answer. Mr. Cross asked him to maove, and he gave no answer. Mr. Cross and Mr. Green said they would remove him, upon which he suddenly stood Up and faced Mr. Cross In the position of a puguist. Mr. Cross, a powerful man, caught him by the arm, and the oonstable seimed him round the waist, while some handcuffs were brought, and Mr. Croes asked the prlsoner, "Wil you be quiet ?" Ie said he would be quiet, and he became quiet after that. Next morning he was taken before the matIstrates at Much Woolton, and from bis demeanour there the prisoner was evidently, according to the evidence of Mr. Cross, feigning insanity first, but afterwards he became very calm and put questions to the witnesses whlch clearly indicated a sound mind. The prlsoner was finally committed by the magistrates to Rirkdale Gaol, and while there he was seen frequently by Mr. Chalmers, the surgeon of the gaoL The authorities tbought It right he should be seen by anqther person more versed in matters of insanity; and Mr. Cleaton, the governor of RainUIl Lunatic Asylum, saw him on three different occasions. The prisoner was on each occasion perfectly sane. Be (Mr. Ovens) did not Intend to make any comments upon the facts, There were two questions for the jury to decide. The first was whether the prisoner was the person who killed Mr. Molyneux. UJpon that they could have no doubt whatever. The next question would be whether, when he did so, he was in such a state of mind as to be responsible for his actions. The law upon that point was, that every person was presumed to be sane untl the jurz were satisfied by the evidence to the contrary ; and he did, not think he could do better than read an extract on the point from the summing up of Mr. Justice Willes in a similar case on the 4th inst. His Lordship said,- For the salke or the rafety of scety it is of every importance that a dFfence of this desription should not Prevail, except uDon strong evldenoD ; and unless It is made out to your satlsract on that at the timse the offence was committed the prisoner was Incapable or dig. linguihlug between right and wreng, or of being aware that what he wUa doiug waMs cDtrsY to the laws of God and man, you wl not be i'istiedi nacquittIng him.' Be now left the matter in their hands. If it were proved the prisoner ws not responsible for his actions, then he (Mr. Ovens) would be gla lf they could acquit the prisoner; ut lf they could not come to the conclusion that that was so, justicerequired at their hands averdict of guilty ~Moss, the landlord of the house, and his wife were then called; also Mrs. ay and two oths witnesses, who deposed to the various facts above statd The Rev. Charles Kershaw, parish priest of the Catholic ehapel at Woolton, tated that he was In the chapel on Sunday, tbe 1st of November, and in consequence of a message whiech had been left with his housekeeper by Mrs. Moss he went to see the-prisoner. He satd-Upon going into the room, I spoke some few words of encouragement to the prisoner. Mrs. Molyneux was in the room. I found the prisoner kneeling in the room, and leaning with the fore part of his body on the bed, with a book before htm. He rose up and seemed very much flurried. I patted him on the shoulder and asked him the reason of his drunkenness, whether it was company or a taste for drink. Be said It was company, and I advised htm to try and do better in future. I don't think he made any reply. The deceased told me the prisoner had boen very unquiet all the morning. He appeared like a man recovering from a drunken fit. At about half-past 3 o'clock I went again to the house. There were 20 or 30 persons about the entrance. I pushed open the door with a man named Gore. We went upstairs, and near the door of the room we saw a pool of blood, and upon going into the room I saw the deceased lying on the floor beneath the window. She was covered with blood. The prisoner was standing over the body fumbling vith a portion of deceased's dress. The prisoner then said, 'I have done it." This was in answer to a question from Mr. Gore. Inspector Green then came in. There seemed to rne to be an unusual degree of calmness about theprisoner, almost preternatuL Ithink he was still sufferingfromdrink;* his breathingwas quiek and he appeared to be hot. By the JunDGE-I did not think the prisoner at that time in a state for further conversation. Robert Green, inspeotor of police, at Woolton, also said, -I recollect Sunday, the 1st of November. On that day, in consequence of information I received, I went to Moses house. I saw the dead body of deceased on the floor. As I was going into the room I heard the prisoner say, "I did it." The prisoner seemed quite calm as he raised himself up from the deceased. I saw nothing in his appearance to induce me to think he was not in his senses at the time. I had seen him before. [ in the first instance sent for Mr. Cross, the surgeon. Air. Cross followed me there. When I got to the station I asked the prisoner his name. He said, A ndrew O'Brien."' I asked him if he knew what he was brought there for, and he said, "Yes, for tne murder of Margaret he stated that at that time he thought the prisoner was a man of very weak intellect. His Lordship then proceeded to read over and comment upon the medical testinony given, and next went on to direct attention to the various facts of the case as deposed to by the witnesses for the prosecution If the jury were of opinion, taking all the prisoner's previ. ous conduct into consideration, that the circumstances also under which it was done showed it to be the act of insanity, it would be their duty to acquit him of the charge. If, however, they believed that at different periods he might have been subjected to conditions such as might at times have made him an irresponsible agent-if they were satisfied he was at the time he committed this act in a state to know what he was about, and to appreciate the consequences of the act he was doing, It would then be their duty to find him guUty. But if, under all the circumstances, they found him incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, they would then regard him as an irresponsible agent, and he would be entitled to an acouittal oa that ground. The jury, after an absence of half an hour, returnedfinto court, and, amid profound silence, said, in answer to the usual question by the Clerk of the Crown,- "-We find the prisoner Hot %ity; that he was insane at the time of the offence, and he is acquitted on the ground of insanity." Some applause was manifested upon the verdict being announced. r The court was densely crowded during the course of the day, and the case appeared to excite the deepest interest. The prisoner wil be kept in confinement during Her Majesty's pleasure. YORK, DEc. 10. (Before Mr. Justice WILLIAMS.) Thomas Eitchen, aged 40, was indicted for bigamy, in having married Ann Baldwin onthe 7th of December, 1851, at Bradford, his former wife being then alive. Dr. Bower prosecuted ; the prisoner was undefended. The formal proofs having been given of the marriage of the prisoner with his first wife on the 4th of June, 1848, and that she was still alive, Ann Baldwin, an awkward, stupid looking woman, was called to prove her subsequent marriage with the prisoner. This she proved to have been celebrated at Bradford parish church on the 7th of December, 1851, and that she had had two children by the prisoner. The prisoner, a rough-looking labourer, with red hair, then proceeded to cross-examine her. Now, then, what did parson say tome when you say we wos wed ? Witnesg.-I doan't knaw. Did he openabookand say to me, "SayasIsay?" Witness.-Yes. Did I shout awt " Say as I say?" (A Iaugh.) Stop a a bit; and did the congregation set up a crack of laughing, same as these fowks? Witness.-Yes. Very well; and did parson say to me, " Conduct yourself properly, Sir, or I shaU not marry you to-day P' Witness,-Yes. Well; so we jogged on, dldn't we, till the middle, he reading, and I saying as he said? (A laugb.) Witness.-Yee. Then he says, "Speak louder. Will you marry tbis woman? Say, 'I will "' and I sa:d loend out, "I shaln'e," didn't I? Wtness (hesitatingly).-Y-e-s. (Loud laughter.) Well; and then he said, "I sUh no, ma-ry you to.day -stand down," didn't he ? Wltne6s-Yes. Well; I stepped down, didn't I? And it was a bigger drop than I thought, and I nearly fell and let fall the rmng out of ray hand, didn%tI? Witness.-Ye8. Well,, there was nine couple being wed, warn't there? AndBify Wl8hwasthee, war'the? And didn't he pick up the ring, and say, ,ThoWukrt notwed yet; I wilt wed Witness.-Yes. Did Billy Walsh put t' ring on thee finger ? Mr. DEARSLEY (amicu6 curiCr).-And go through the rest of thae ceremony. Witnem.-I can't say, I am sure. (Loud laughter.) Did aron bid me stand down then, and did I stand Witness.-Yes, thou did. Did I ever stand up before that mon since ? Witness.-No. Then out of church I walks, and this woman followed me. Did thou ask me if I would go again and get wed awt, and give )mo some money to go pay the pasron to get wed again, and x wodn't go2 Witness.-Yes. Didn't I say if thou has any money to go and pay for a piece of a job, go and pay him thyself 7 Didn'tlsayIshall no1_pAy till he h finshed his job ? (Loud laughter,) Witne-Yes. Did you leave me in the churchyard witlf Sally Burnet, and did you say you would goto the vestry and try to get wed out ? (Laughter.) Witness.-Yes. Did you come back laughing to me and say " he's ta'en bross, and I'm to bring thee again before him to-morrow ?7" Witnes.-Yes. (Loud laughter.) After that does thou oonsider thou art married. Did'nt the people about thee say thou was not married. Witness.-Thon art asking me more than I can remember. (Loud laughter.) Well, did I put t'ring on thy finger, or Billy Walsh ? Witness.-Billy Walsh. (Gareat laughter.) The witness was here re-examined by the learned counsel, and stated that she had put her mark to the register, and bad seen the pLisoner do the same. (An examined oopy of the register was produced, and appeared to bear out thAt fact.) In answver to his Lordshp the witness stated that sbe had said before the magistrates that she had been mar. ned to the prisoner. A witness was called, Sarah Bumnet, who said she did not remember the incidents of the wedding spoken to by the last witness. The prisoner, in his defence, said,-Well, I coneider that this Eecond was not a marriage. I neither put the ring On, nor ad any monev; and I never said " I will," but I said " aIarnt." Idonrteonsider that a marriage. His LoRDsEap, in summing up, said he could not blame persons for laughing as the trial proceeded, as there were eircumstances in It very ludicrous. But the case had now assumed a serious aspect, as the prisonerhad evidently ot the second wife to perjure herself to endeavonr to screen uim. This in itself was a very grave offence, The testimony of this woman oould not be believed, contradicted as ltwas by the examined copy of the register, and bythe other witness who was present. *Lhe jury found the prisoner Guilty, but recommended him to mercy on account of his Ignorance. He was ordered to stand down, senteince being deferred. Thomas Willis was charged with having cut and wounded a girl named Mary Ann Dobson, with intent to do her glievous bodily harm. Mr. C. Newton eonducted the prosecution. The prosecutrix an exceedingly handsome girl, 20 years of age, stated she had become acquainted with the prisoner Eight or nine months ago, and within the last few months had been living with him at Whitby and Scarborough, she having some hopes that he would eventually make her his wife ;but as she was disappointee in this she left the house in Scarborough where they had been last living to{ether, at about 6 o'clock In the evening on the 26th of November, taking with her her clothes, and thence proceeding to the house of her parents in Scarborough. The prisoner appears to have been nearly frantic snd greatly excited, either bv her desertion of him or his jealousy, owing to her havng been seen with some other men. However that might be, on coming up with her in the street he seized her violently and dashed her against the wall. She got away, and he was detained for a short time, but he appeared wholly unable to control himself, and exclaimed " that he could not bear this, and, Oh, 'vhat should he do." He presently followed her, and on again coming up with her he called to her, " Come, Polly, let me kiss thee ; thou kmow'st that I love thee " and on her refusing to have anything to do with him heseized her in his arms, stabbed her with his penknife, and then twice stabbed himself, saying they would die together. This being Martinmas Fair, there were many people about, some of whom interfered, and he was prevented doing any more mischief by being taken into custody. Their wounds were not very serious, and the prisoner appeared deeply sorrowful for what had happened. He was found Guilty, and sentenced to one yeas Imprisonment with hard labour.
MIDLAND CIRCUrr. LINCOLN, DEC. IL (Before Mr. Justicc CRomrpToN.) George Yarnel, aged 20, farm labourer, wa6 indicted for a rape on the person of Harriet Clapham. Mr. Flowers proseouted ; and Mr. Beil defended the prisoner. It appeared that the prosecetrix, who was in the service of Mr. Dawber, a farmer at Cold Hanworth, went on the 16th of September last to Faldingworth feast; that she returned home, accompanied by a policeman, about 4 o'clock in the morning; and that about the same time two othor servants of Mr. Dawber, a man named Spick and a lad of 16, named Ingham, also returned from the same feast. The prisoner was in company with Splck immediately before the occurrence in question, which took place in a field In front of Mr. Dawber's houm, and according to the statement of Spick himself, who was examined as a witness, actually in cis presence, and that of the lad. The account of the prosecutrix was that the policeman left her at her master's gate, and that upon her getting to the door she found the prisoner there, who asked her to go with him; bat she told bim to o away. She stated that he then carried her away to a field in front of the house, and that although she caught at the rails she could not prevent him from getting her through the gate into the field, and after a struggle, which lasted (she said) half an hour, accomplish. ing his purpose. She cried, and called out the name of the governess, who slept in the front of the hoose, but nobody came to her assistance, and the witness Spick (who saw aU that was going on) explained his not interfering by saying that she did not call u np him by name. After the occurrence, however, he got a ladder and went into the honse by a window, and then opened the door to let in the prosecutrx, who next morning made a complaint of what had happened, and in the afternoon laid the present charge against the prisoner. She was cros-examined as to her behaviour at the feast and as to the extent of her resistince, and she stated that ahe danced two dances at the feast, and that she had resisted the prisoner as much as she could. Mr. BELL addressed the jury for the defence, and argued that if the proseectrix had resisted very strenuously thero could be no doubt that the men would have come to her assistance. The learned JIUDGX summied up, and the jury, havini found the prisoner Guilty, he was sentenced to 20 years penal servitude. The learned JuDGx at the same time roprobated in the strongest terms the brutal and unmanly conduct of Spick and lugham. both of whom appeared ln the uniform of the Lincolnshire militia. John Jordan was Indicted for a burglary at Scotbhern on the 15th of May laet. Mr. Flowers conducted the prosecution. The prisoner was undefended. At the last assizes for this county fivo men were convicted of a very daring burglary in the house of Mr. Binder Wortb, a farmer of great respectabUity at Scothern, and on that oceasion, when the eircumstances weso fuUy investigated, the remarkable self-possession and bravery of Mr. Worth's two daughters called forth universal admiration. It ap. feared fromn their statements that the family were aroused on tbe night in question by finding in the houso six men armed with guns and life-preservers, who surrounded the bed of Mr. Wortb, and threatened his life unless he would give up his money, watches, plate, and other property of the same description; that the daughters, who slopt in an adjoining room, upon the alarm being given, went to their father's bedside, and entreating them not to hurt bim watched all the proceedings of the burgtars while they ransacked the house, and that one of the six men stood constantly for about half an hour at the side of the bed with a gun pointed at Mr. Worth. That man was not apprehended at the time of the former trial, but had siee been taken into custody, and was now charged with the same offence of which his companions were convicted at the last assizes. Mr. and Mrs. Worth and their daughters were now again examined as to the transaction, and Mrs. Worth and her two daughters spoke positively as to the identity of the prisoner. They had all three picked him out at once and without communication with each other from six men who were shown to them in the Castleyard at Lincoln. The inry found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to 20 sears' penal servitude. Mr. Adam Bittleston, barrister-at-law, and one of the cOmmissioners of gaol delivery for this circuit, assisted the learned judge by trying prisoners in a second court. Dzc. 12. Thomas Wright, a-ed 5a, wine and spirit merchant, was Indicted for embeziing and stealing 3,0211. 9s. 9d., the moneys of the Stamford, Spalding, and Boston Banking Company, his masters. Mfr. Boden and Mr. Bittleston were counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. O'Brien for the prisoner. The prisoner has for upwards of 20 years been employed by the above mentioned banking company at Wainfleet to conduct what waS termed an agency bank there, at which the customers of the banking company who had accounts with the Boston branch might pay in money and get their checks cashed. He had a salary of 1501. a-year, out of which he provided an office for tbe bank business, which was fitted up, however, at the expense or the company, and provided with a strong box for the safe custody there of the moneys and securities of the Banking Company. The prisoner was supplied with money from Boston when necessary, and his duty was to receive, also, money from customers, and to honour the checks of customers drawn upon the Boston branch; to put every night into the strong box whatever moneys he had In hand; to make weekly returns to the Boston manager of his receipts and payments and of the balance in hand, specifying the description of money or notes of which that balance consisted; and also to remit to Boston any excess of cash which he might have in hand beyond the amount reguired for carrying on the Wainfleet office. Occasionally (ri time to time, as he thought desirable, the general manapr and public officer of the company paid a visit to the Wainfleet office for the purpose of Inspecting the books and examining the oash in the coffers of the bank there - and such a visit was paid on the 29th of September, 15a5d At that tmte, according to the prisoner's accounts, wohich were quite correct, his balance In hand amounted to 2,1511. 17s.6Cd., and that amountwRasthen found to be In the bank coffers at Wainfleet. From that time the prisoner had continued regularly to deliver to the Boston manager hi weeki accounts, and to send remittances of cash from time to tuno ; and by his accoant delvered on the 7th of September last, he represented that he had then a bslnooe in hand of 3,4761. 3a ld. Bat on the following Saturday, when the Boston manager and tb- general manager went over to Wainfleet to examine the cash in the bank, they found only a sum of 7931. 15g., and the prisoner at once stated to them that he was 3,0001. short in his cash. In fact, upon an examination of the cashbook whioh he kept, and upon a statement of account which be himself then drew up, it appeared that his defi. cdency amounted to no less a sum than 3,0211. 9s. 9d. At this disclosure the managers were greatly sarprised and p;resed the prisoner to say what had become of the money; but his only answer was that he did not know, and could not tell; and wben he was reminded that his cash had been all right in September, 1855, he Wsd, " It appeared so." Agai"n when ne was before the magistrates, he admitted in so many words that he had tken from the bank the sum of 3,0211, 9s. 9a mentioned asadeficiency in the account given by him on the 12th of September. Mr. O'BRn? obgected that there was no evidence to sfgtain any oount of the indictment. As to those which charged an embezzlement of 3,0211. 9s. 9d., they could not be supported, beeausetheprosecution bad failed to show any particular sum of money received by the prisoner on account of his master, and embezzled; nor, for the same reaon, could the prisoner be oonvicted of larceny upon those count,. A general defioiency upon a balance of accounta was not enough. Further, he could not be convicted of larceny, becaue there ws no evidenoe of his WIdug any aum of monoy which had ever reached his masters poses slon; and although the jury might convict of larceny upon an indictment framed as this was, if the evidence proved larceny, they could not convict t all if they were lPeft in doubt whether the offence was embezzlement or larceny. As to the counts framed under the 4th section of the recent Fraudulent Tsustee Act, it was suficient to say that that Act only came into operation on tho 17th of Angust lat, and there was no evidence of any misappropriation by the prisoner necessariy subeecuent to that date. Mr. BOnDEN, for the prosecution, subhmitted that it was for the jury under the direction of the judge, upon thefacts to say whether the offence of the prisoner was larceny or embezzlement, but that in his judgment, in the present case, the evidenoe pointed much more strongly to a stealing of money which had been reduced into the possession of the Banking Company by being put Into the appointed place of deposit, than to an embezzlement of money which had been received from the customers, but had never been so deposi. ted. Ee also contended that upon the prisoner's own statements there was cogent evidence that on some occasion the prisoner had taken out of the coffers of the bank some part of the sum of 3,021Z. 9. 9d.; and that the particular amount and the particular day were quite immaterial and need not be specHied. Further, as to the counts chargin the prisoner as a bailee under the recent statute, he argled that the statement of account made by the prisoner on the 7th of Seteiber must be taken to be true as against him; and, if it was true, then the misappropriation must have taken place since the statute passed, and that even if .the prisoner was a clerk or servant of the company within the statute against embezzlement, he might also be a baLlee under the recent Act. The learned fuDGE thought that the fourth section of the recent statute would not apply to the case of a clerk or servant; but held that there was evidence to go to the jury upon the other counts, and expressed his own opinion that the evidenoe was stronger to prove a larceny than to prove embezzlement. Mr. O'BsiN then addressed the jury upon those counts. The learned JuDGE in summing up told the jury that upon the counts for embezzlement thej' might convict of larceyif thg thought the evidence proved a larceny; and t if they thought that the prisoner had appropriated to his own use any money which had been supplied to him from the Boston branch, or any money which he had received from customers and had deposited in the strong box, his offence would be larceny * vhereas It would be embezzlement if he had intercepted money received from the customers before it was ever put into the coffers of the bank. He did not consider It necessary that any precise sum of money or any precise day should be fxed upon; but if the jury were satis6ed tfat on any ose occasion ince the 29th of September, 1855, he had taken any part of the 3a021l., they might find him guilty. The Jury retired to consider their verdict, and on their return found the prisoner Guilty of larceny from his mas. ters, andtheystated,in replyto questions put bythe learned Judge, that they found that he had taken and appropriated to his own use some money which, after being received from tbe customers, had been deposited in the strong box kept at the bank for that purpose. The learned JuDGE stated that he would consider further whether he would reserve any question for the Court of Criminal Appeal, but at present his impression was against doing so, and he sentenced the prisoner to six years penal servitude. Harinsh Wright, ged 19, serv7ant, was indicted for attempting to murder her child by suffocation. The learned JUDGE having SummIed up the evidence, the ury imnmediately returned a verdict of Guilty, and his ordship sentenced her to 20 years' penal servitude.
POLIrO. MA2NSION-dOUSP.-David Ross,& labourer, was brought Dp on remand charged with stealing three tanned hidee, vavlue 41. lCa., the property of Messrs. Powell and Co., leather factors, 36, Lime-street. On the former exaniiration evidence was given of the loss of the hides by the prosecutors, and of three hides of adsimilar description having been offered for sale by the prisoner at a prce much below their value. William Trew, a journeyman currier, deposed that the prisoner sent for him and asked If he could sell three split hides for him, and on witness expressing a hope that they had been honourably come by, he assured him that such was the case. He then agreed to seU them, and prisoner told him that he might keep whatever he could get over 50s. for thom. Witness sold them for21. 215, giving 503. to the prisoner, and keeping 5s. for himself. Although a curner, witness was no judge of the real value of the bides.

The LoRD MAiYOlR.-Why it's a regular sliding scale we shall get to the real value of these hides directly. Witness.-I think we are pretty well up to the value now.

Souie years ago he worked with the prisoner, and on the day of the robbery saw,him near the warehousedoor.

LuensrETIr-Wr. Feist, the late master of Newington Workhouse, attended for the purpose of contradiering a statement made by Cook, the parish constable, on a former day, to the effect that he had been discharged from his situation in consequence of malpractices lately discovered in the disposal of the bodies of paupers for anatomical poxposes. Mr. Wontner, who attended for Mr. Feist, saia that the report was calculated to injuve his character, if uncontradicte ; but, in fact, Mr. Feist had tendered his redignation bore anything had been said about the disposal of the bodies. The guardians had refused his resignation, and stated that he was the best master they had ever had. Several members of the Board of Gnardians were in attendance vith their clerk, Mr. Burgess, to make some explanations respecting a poor man named Parsley, 'whose wife had been catrried away in a very mysterious scanner, and burled, as it was alleged, for another rceron, and out of 'which the report complalned of by r. Feist arose. It was stated that after a careful investigation the board were unasimously of opinion that the body of Mrs. Parsley had been buried by mistake, and other circumstances had been discovered requiring serious explanation on the part of Mr. Peist. Mr. Burgess stated, that although the guardians had refused to accept the resignation of Mr. Feist, they had subsequently dismissed him. It was certainly true that there had been many malpractices discovered on the part of the late undertaker to the parish, who it was found had been paid for the fnterment of at least 20 bodfes, which he had disposed of at the hospitals for 31. 5s. or S3. IOs. each. So far, however, as regarded Mrs. Parsley an order hsad been sent to the cemetery for the exhumation of the body, so as to satisfy her friends. Mr. XORTOx remarked that a most scandalous system had evidently been oarried on by some parties, annd it was his opinion that the guardians should take the matter up, and puslsh the offenders as they deserved. He 'was ready to grant a summons at once In the case. It was ultimately arranged that a little time should be given to enable the guardians to consult the Poor Law Board, and thus the matter rests at present. GnmE1rN cL-Mr. TRAILL lannounced the receipt of a donation of 201. from the Goldsmiths' Company for the poor-box of this court, an acknowledgment of whlch was requested in 217e Times.

LONDON AND BASTBBZ BANKING GOMFANY. EXAMIATION OF J. E. STEPHENS. EDINBURGH, THiuRSDAy. The examination of Mr. Stephens was resumed before Mr. Sheriff Hallard to-day at 1 o'clock. The bankrupt, interrogated by Mr. Young, deponed:I now produce and place in the hands of the trustee the builder' accounts referred to in my examination of yesterday for the improvement of my property at Gothio-lodge, Twickenham. One of these acoouuts is for the year 1855 and the second for the year 1856 the last date being the 15th of September of that year. hese accounts were thus incurred before my marriage. They were naid by me on the 18th of December, 1856, by a check on my bank account. I had no other baak account except that kept in my name in the London and Eastern Bank. The peroonal debts whtch I owed at the time of moy marriage were, firt, the aforesaid acount for 3,2361.; second, an account to Mr. Rochart, jeweler, 821. 9s. 6d. ; third, an account to Mr. Benson, jeweller, 171. 2s.; fourth, an amcount to Messrs. Buckmaster, tailors, 101. 9s.; fifth, I owed Colonel Macleod, in India, 1,6651.; sixth, debt to Captain Stephen, 4501.; seventh, I owed for calls on the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, 1,3501. I do not know of any other debts of a personal nature wbich I then owed. These are distinot from my debts in the trading concerns in which I was a partner. I beg to explain that I intended to have paid these debts out of the excess of my income over my annual expenditure. Interrogated as to the debt to Captain Stephens, depones : -I now find I have made an error. This account was incurred subsequently to my marriage. Before my marriage Captain Stephens had lent me money. I had an acount with him, and there was a balance due by me at my marriage. Interrogated.-How much money had he lent you before your mariage ? Depones.-To the best of my recollection he had lent me tho sum of 1751., I think abont 18 months before my r4arriage, and 451. remained due at the date of my marriage. Ido not hemember having had any other loan from him. Beimg shown in his book of receipts and expenditure the two following entries :-" March 13, 1854.-Interest to Captamn Stephens for loan of 6,5001., 1511. 3sa. 4d.;" " June 30, interest ditto, 1621. l0s,,'-; Depones.-These entries are In my handwriting. Interrogated.-At these dates were you not due the sum of 6,5001. to Captain Stephens? Depones.-I had that loan from my father, Captain J. M. Stephens. The Captain Stephens referred to before was aptain W. F. Stephens, my brother. I owed my father nothing at the time of my marriage, I paid 3,0001. of my ebt to him by a transfer to him of that amount of Iondon and Bastern Bank shares. This transfer was made in the latter end of 1854, but the shares still stood in my name. They -were held by me for him. There was properly no transfer at all. The shares were 60 in number. It was verbally arranged between my father and myself that I should hold these shares as for him, but there was no writing on the subject. At his death the estate received credit for these shares. He died in April, 1855. I mean by that to say that these shares were sold by me for behoof of his estate. I do not remember to whom I sold them. I sold them at par for 3,0001. Interrogated.-To whom did you give the money? Depones.-I vwas executor and residuary legatee of my father, and accouanted for these shares in my residaary account. Interrogatedc.-Were not these the shares you sold to Colonel Waugh ? Depones.-They were not. Interrogated.-Are you sure of that? Depones.-I do not remember. They were sold in Mtay, 1855. I remember I sold Colonel Waugh 3,0001, worth of shares in the bank in tho spring of 1855w. Interrogated.-Did you sell shares to any other person in the spring or summaer of 1855 ? Depones.-I could not remember unless I saw the trans. fer-book. Interrogated.-Did you sell 3,0001. or 6,0001. worth in the spring or summjer of 1855 ? Depozcs.-I cannot say; but the transfer-book will show. On being shown the transfer-book, depones :-The price of the shares sold by me to Colonel Waugh wrent into my account with the bank on the 1lOth of may, 1855. Interrogated.-EHow do you account for the remaining 3,5001. dae to your father-have yoa ever paid that debt ? Depones.-I don't remember when I paid it. Interrogated.-Did you pay it? Depones.-I think I did. Interrogated.-Did you pay it? Deponecd-Itdid pay it. I was not due that sum at the date of his death, Interrogated.-Wbea did you pay it? Depones.-I do not remember, Interrogated.-How did you pay it? Depones.-I do not remember. Interrogated.-Have you any receipt for it? Depones.-I had no receipt for It. Re-interrogatod.-Did you pay it s Depones.-I did. I know 1 am not due it. Interrogated.-Is the payment entered in any book of youirs. Depones.-No. I never kept any regular cashbook which should show each transaction. My receipt book was made up by me at the end of each year from memoranda, and my pasbook with the bank. I entered balances only in that book, and regular receipts and interest. Interrogated.-Did your father leave a settlement? Depunes.-He did. I administered under it. I have not gotacopofthewlL It ws give upito he Stap-office. I could get a copy of it, withthqeepapers showig smy administration. I could almost show the transactions from my Mr. Young required production of Captain J. M. Stephens'e will, or a copy, the list of assets of the estate, the debts paid, and the residuary account. Bankrupt deponed.-I will produce them as far as I possibly can. At the date of my marriage I was not indebted to Lord Gough for money lent to me by him. He had prior to my marriage lent me money. He lent me 8,000I. before I left India. I gave him a bond for that sum. I do not remember when I paid him back. I paid him when he and I came home. W e both returned from India in 18;10. I think it was that year that I paid him. Interrogated.-Elow did you pay him 9 Depones.-I think I paid him with a transfer to my ac. count with the bank. Interrogated.-Whiat dlo you, mean by a transfer to your account vith the bank ? Depones.-1 mean that I paid him with a draught on the bank. Interrogated.-What bank? Depones.-I think on the London branch of the Simla Bank. Interrogated.-Are you sure of it? Depones.-No, I am not. I am not sure whether I paid him in this way or by a transfer of shares. Interrogated.-What kind of shares? Depones.&-Bank shares. Interrogated.-What bank? Depones.-Either the Simla Bank or the London and Ea6'tern. I beg to explan that Lord Gough lent me the 5, 0001. above referred to to he invested in my own name in Siila Bank shares. I did so invest the oney. Interrogated.-How many shares of the Sirnb Bank did you possess ? Depones.-I think about 10,0001. worth stood in my name. Interrogated.-And 8,000?. of that you paid with the money you got from Lord Gough ? Depones.-I believe I did. If I did not pay him by a draught on my bank account, I paid him by a transfer of Simla Bank shares to that amount. The Simla Bank ceased to exist in January, 1854, and the London and Eastern Bank was formed upon it. I had many transactions with Lord Cough. Being shown his book of receipts in his own handwriting, and referred to an entry ol'August 29, 1&54, "Lard Gough, interest on loan of 8,000., 119?. 14s. 7d.," and Interrogated.-Does that entry not prove that the 8,000?, was not paid at that date ? Depones--No, it does not. A brief adjournment here took placeo, and in the interval the bunkru2tf looked over his receipt book. Onx reseining He wvas furteor interrogated. Was the debt due by you at that time to Lord Gough ? Depones. -It was. I cannot now state at what date sub-. seunent to that entry thCat debt was paid. Neing allowed to examine his account with the bank, and interrogated: -Are you still unable to say when that debt was paid ? Depones.-The debt to Lord Gough was paid in England. I beg to state that I had money from Lord Gough other tha th e 8,0001. to be invested in railway and other stock, for which I paid him interest; but the amount of the principal sum so handed over to me by Lord Gough will not he found either debited or credited in my bank account. I am not, in makldng tho answver last recorded$ speaking of the 8.0001. previously mentioned as got by me from Lord (Cough and invested in Simla Bank stock, but of other SUMS. Interrogated.-You got this 8,000?. and invested it in Simla Bank shares, and these shares were apparently your property? Depones.-Yes. Interrogated.-Did you not credit in yourbook of receipts the dividends received by you upon these 8,000?. worth of shares? Depones.-I did not. MY Attention being called to entye i oo us recepts-in y --dwriing =,l wy os o receipts, in my handwriting, under dates respectively 25th of February and 25t t; of June, 1850; 30th of April, 1851; 7th of January and 1st of April, 1852 ; 20th of April and 3d of M-ay, 1853; 1st of January and 10th of Augnst, 1854 ; 30th of January, 2d of February, arnd 28th of u aly, iB55-all being entries of dividends received by me on Siunla Bank and London and Eastern Bank shares, I depone that they apply to the full amount of the shares which I held in these concerns at the time. The Simla Bank shares were converted into London and Eastern Bank shares on the formation of the latter bank in 1854. Interro2ated.-From what source did you obtain the money with which after the 29th of August, 1854, you repaid the 8,0001. to Lord Gou~h Depones.-I do not remember. I think that the shares whicih were held in my name for Lord Gough were transferred to the name of General Grant, and that the payment of tho loan was made in this way. my attention being caUled to an entry on the credit side of miy account with the London anid Eastern Bank of the dlate of the 26th of September, 1856, " - Stephens and others, deposit withdrawn this day, 3,5001.," and being interrogated, to what does this refer, I state that this wvas made up of two sums transferred from the credits of Stephens and others on deposit account to my credit on current account, That sum of 3,500?. was my money. Interrogated.-From whom did you get Ib ? Depones.-It was transferrdfo radesi cun to my current account, y deposit account Interrogated.-On that day 9-Yes Being requested to show th ent'ry of that sum in his deposit acoountk and the entry in the accouLnt current by which it was transerred from the first to -the seoond, Interrogated.-Is it not there? tJ e.posit acconnt.

Interrogated.-Do these sums, then, form the 3 5004 which were placed to your eredit on current accountoi Septeraber 26, 1856 ? Depones.-Seeing this journal, I say they do. Interrogated.-Are you now satisfied, then, that that money was not yours? Depones.-I am, and that what I stated before was art error. I am certain, however, there is some mlstake, fog I had a deposit acoount for 3,5001. in my own name quibw independent of this account of Mr. and Mrs. Fox. Aftel! consultation with his counsel and agent, the bankrupt withdrew this statement. He further deponed at the same time,-I transferred to my own credit the 3,5001. abovementioned. I also transferred to my credit the intereat that bad accrued thereon to that date, being 411. 14s. 2d. Interrogated.-What was Your reason for transferring this money from the credit of the parties to whom it be_ longed to the credit of yourself, to whom It did not belong!' Depones.-I decline to answer that question. Oa the 6Qb of November following I transferred the said sum of 3,5W?. from my own credit to the credit of the parties from whoso credit it had been taken. Interrogawd.-Did you also re-trsnsfer the interest9 Deposes.-I did not. After a pausr, bankrupt sald.-T now withdraw that answer, which was a mistake, and I de- cline to answer the question. [The record was ordered to, bear the declinature to answer, but not the withdrawal.1 In my current account under date of the 22d of July, 18563 occurs this entry on the credit side:-"Purchased 1a; shares London and Eastern Bank, P Griffiths, 6,0001," Interrogated.-What does this entry represent? Depones.-A purchase of 120 shares from Mr. Griffith, transferred from his name to mnine. I purchased these, shares from him for the bank. The trans-ers were taker In my own name. I paid Mr. Griffiths by check upon miy bankoacount for 60001. now shown to me, daved July 22, 1856. That sum is entexed to my debit of that date in rny current account. After the purchase Idrow the dividends. upon these shares. I placed them to the credit of my RCcount with the blnk, They now appear on the credic side, of my account current. The amount of the second dividernd was re-transferred from my ascount to the interest accourt. of the hank. Intenrogated.-Was that on the eve of the stoppage of' thebak Depones. -It was on the 18th of February, 1857. Interrogated.- Can you show any authority for the statemnent than these shares were purchased by you for the bankZ Depones,-I cannot. Interrogated.-Do the bank now maintain that you had!. no authority to purchase these sharea ? Depones.-Yes, they do; but it was understood by all the directors that these shares.should be parchased from Mr. Griffith8 in order to get the meat in the direction for which. he had a claim for Colonel Yates. Interrogated.-Were these shares ever transferred to Colonel Yates? Deaones.-No; it vas never intended that they should be. Colonel Yates was not a director, but he became a director on the date of the purchase of these shares. He ha& a sufficient number of shares of his own to qualify hinm for a seat in the direction; but Mr. Griffiahs hz a claim for the seat falling vacant on the 2Lst of July, and, in order to get his seat for Colonel Yates, it was thought expetient. to purchase these shares from him, on condition of which. purchase alone he surrendered his claim. When Ar. Gnfflitb sold the shares he agreed to give the dividend, then past due, to tho purchaser. He allowed me to receive that dividend, arid I did so. I can show no authority for placing that 6,0001. on the 22d of July, 1856, to my credit. with regard to the state of nny liabilities to the bank as amember of various trading concerns referred to in the previous part of my deposition,as at the date of my marriage, I have to state that I was jointlyliable with Mr. Black for the dehts due hb Lett's-wharf ; and Minter and Co. with Colonel Waugh for the debt due to the hank by the Brankese Clay Company, and Mr. Lattey for the debt due by Lattey and Co., incudiDg Barwise au& Co.; but the securities held by the hank amply covered all these adeances. At 5 o'clock the examination was further adjourned till Monday, at 10 o'clock.
TIIE PltomRssioy OF A Co.-When Mark Tapleywas taken into partnership at Eden he said that he was delighted at last to think he was a Co., for he had always wished to know what a Co. was, and now he had found out. If Mr. Stephens ever indulged in a sinilar curosity he must have amply gratified it. Re must have exhausted the sensations of being a Co. He has shown himself ready to be a Co. in any imaginable trade at a moment's notioe. It was his profesaion. Xominsally, he was nanager of a bank, but really his occupation was being a Co., different officials o£ the Eastern Banking Company joining in the diversion. In lSn5 he was a Co. three times. First of all he and the secretary of the bank-, Mr. Black-, were " Lttt's Wharf Company," timber merchants and sa>wyers; then he and one of she directors, Mr. Lattey, were Barwise and Co., watchmakers; and, lastly, he and Colonel Waugh were the Branksea ClAV Company. In 1-i,i he and the secretary became Minter and Co., upholsterers; and, in short, he was a Co. so often that he was unable to say on. his examination whether he was or was not a Co. in any concern that might be mentioned; and, although he had a. misgiving that he was the Patent Carpet Company, he conld not recollect clearly his position in thatenterpnse. bar oe was not a Co. for nothing, and he made the profession a lucrative one in this way :-When he found a trading firm willing to sell its goodwill and effects he purchased the stock with monoy which he drew out of the bank. He and the other Co.'s, that is, the other officials of the bank in the same line of business, then commenced operations as sawyers, watchmakers, or upholsterers. If the corcern succeededas for a short time, with an established name to begin with, it might easily do-they pocketed the pro. fits; if the concern failed, the bank lost the money. Setting honesty side, the profession of Co. is evidently, as long as it lasts, a very safe and pleasant one, involving no personal trouble and no risk whatever, and holdinz out the cbance of considerable cain.. In the office of the Eastern Banking Company everything was carried on in the most comfortable way, and the, Co.'s made up quite a family party. When Mr. Black and the manager proposed to start as Minter and Co., npholsterers and invalid chairmak-ers, they announced the lsde. sign in the most artless way to the directors, and informed them the sum they wanted was 2,8001. " Loan granted to Minter and Co., 2,8001.," was gravely entered in the agenda book by Mr. Morris, the chairman, and the next day Mr. Stephens married Mr. Morris's daughter. Therem is a solemnity about the process of plandering a bank. in this way which must add greatly to tne ernjoyment of peculation, if the rogues have a surdcient Sense of the ludicrous to relish it. Putting yonr hand in a strongbox or a till is a very commonplace and unimagina. tive proceeding; but making a formal statement that yoer are going to be Yinter and Co., and want 2,S004l to make. Invalid chairs, and getting your father-in-law to hand the sum over to yon and enter in a handsomely-bound agenda. book, "Loan granted,"Is a real stroke of ingenuity aind. fun. The history of che Branktea Clay Company deserves to be studied sep.rately. Colonel W.ugh, who for a brief space made htmself a lion in tbe great world by the insFne magnificence of his entertainments, was perhaps the fnest; Co. tha, ever practised. He had been acquainted itt India with Mr. Stephens, who before he blo-somed into a Co. was an assistant-surgeon in the Quieen's service, Ile knew his man, and felt that he might. safely treat with him as a Co. IHe accordingly made overtures, and, informing Mr. Stephensthat he was owner of a clay-field' in the Isle of Branksea, which he intended to work, he offered to give hins a half-share in the undertaking. This seemed a handsome offer, for Colonel Waugh was the sole, proprietor of the clay, and Stephens was not to contribute, any capital. But Stephens understood what was meant. He was the manager of a bank, and it was his duty as a Co. to supply Colonel Wauga vwith the money of the shareholders. The directors were too fuU of admiration for so at a pairof Co.'s to make any difficulty. and Colonet to bleed the bank as freely as he chose. We. do not pretend to be able to state the exact amount which in the lOng 1-n these Co.'s got out of the bank; for as soon s he felt ensur of his position with the directors Colonel Wangh managed to possess himself of such vast sums out of the bank funds tha:. it becomes useless, and almost incpos. sible, to attempt to distinguish under what head he was pleased to draw any particular sum. It is, however, worth observng that, according to the statment of Mr. Stephens, Colonel Waugh on one ocesaion obtained 68O,O0 or his simple promissory note, without any collateral security whatever being required. His debt to the bank at the date of the us smash is stated by Stephens to have been no less than 243,000M If this story does not give a warning to the shareholders of banLks, nothing will, If they can hear with equanimity that a manager becomes a Co. four times within a twelvemonth, in branches of business with which he is utterly unacquainted, that he did not invest in any of his undertalings a farthing of his own, and that the directors were cognizant ofD what he was doing, and placed the money of the bank at his disposal, then they deserve to be robbed. Of the doings oE Clonel Waugh we have yet a great deal to learn; bnS the. story of the Co. is complete, and ought to be engrven on the memory of every one who trsuts a joint-stocak bank without making himself fully acqnainted with the chi;actel and the past carger of its offlciah-..-aturday lWt-iW
